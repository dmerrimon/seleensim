3.1 Synopsis  
Title of Study:  A Multi center, Randomized, Double -Blind, Parallel -Group, Active and 
Placebo Controlled Study to Assess the Safety, Efficacy and Tolerability of Oral DFD-29 
Extended Release Capsules for the Treatment of Inflammatory Lesions of Rosacea O ver 
16 W eeks 
Name of Sponsor:  Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., India  
Name of Finished Product:  DFD-29 Extended Release Capsules  
Name of Active Ingredient:  Minocycline HCl  
Objectives  
Primary: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of oral DFD -29 (Minocycline HCl 
Extended Release Capsules) , 40 mg  (hereafter referred to as DFD -29) compared to placebo in 
the treatment of papulopustular rosacea for 16 weeks  
Secondary : To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of DFD -29 compared to  
Doxycycline  capsules  40 mg ( an authorized generic of Oracea® in the United States ) in the 
treatment of papulopustular  rosacea for 16 weeks  
Study  Design:  This is a 16 -week, multicenter, randomized, parallel -group, double -blind, 
controlled study. After assessing eligibility during a screening period of up to 30 days, 
approximately 320 subjects at least 18 years old who are diagnosed with moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea will be randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to DFD -29 (40 mg), D oxycycline  
capsules  40 mg, or Placebo once daily for 16 weeks. 
Subject visits are scheduled at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. 
Clinical assessments of  efficacy will be conducted based on Investigator’s Global Assessment 
modified scale without erythema (IGA), Clinician’s Erythema Assessment (CEA), and total 
inflammatory lesion count at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 compared to Baseline.  
Laboratory assessmen ts of blood (hematology and biochemistry) and urine (routine tests) will 
be conducted at Screening and Week 16 (end of study [EOS] or early termination) to assess for any changes in the safety parameters. Other safety assessments include vital signs, physi cal 
examination, urine pregnancy tests (for females of childbearing potential), and collection of AE data.  
The impact of the treatment on the quality of life (QoL) of the subjects will be assessed using the rosacea- specific tool RosaQoL in addition to the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at 
Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. 
Number of Study  Centers : Approximately 29 study centers in the United States (US)  and 
Europe (Poland and Germany)  to enroll a total of approximately 320 subjects. There will be 
approximately 15 study centers in the US, 4 in Poland, and 10 in Germany.   
Duration of Participation:  Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 
20 weeks  from the time the subject signs the informed consent f orm (ICF) through the final 
contact.  The screening period is up to 30 days and duration of treatment  is 16 weeks.  
Duration of Study : The study will require approximately 10 months from the beginning to the 
end of the study (first subject signing the ICF  to last contact with last subject).

MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  Key Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : Male and female subjects at least 18 years of age in good 
general health with a clinical diagnosis of papulopustular rosacea, IGA grade 3 (moderate)  or 
grade 4 (severe)  at Baseline will be selected to participate in the study . Subjects must have 15 
to 60 (both inclusive) inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) of rosacea over the face and 
not more than 2 nodules or cysts at Baseline.  
Investigational Product, Dose, Route of Administration , and Regimen : 
To maintain the double -blind design, all 3 study medications will be over -encapsulated with the 
original capsules enclosed within a second, larger  (size 0)  capsule shell.  
Investigational product : DFD- 29 (Minocycline Hydrochloride  Extended -Release Capsules ), 
40 mg ( Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.)  
Active control : Doxycycline  Capsules 40 mg  [an authorized generic of Oracea® in the United 
States  (marketed by Prasco Laboratories, Mason OH 45040 USA )] 
Placebo : Capsules matching DFD -29 with same excipients but without minocycline HCl ( Dr. 
Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.)  
The study medication will be taken at a fixed time of the day once a day for 16 consecutive weeks. The preferred time of administration will be in the  morning, after an overnight fast.  
Statistical Methods :  
Analysis Populations :  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subjects  (i.e., assigned to a 
treatment group) . The ITT population will be the primary population for the efficacy 
analysis.  
• Safety population includes subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one safety assessment post -Baseline. The safety population will be used 
for analysis of tolerability and safety variables.  
• Per-protocol popul ation (PP)  comprises all subjects who did not violate the protocol in 
a way that might affect the evaluation of the effect of the study medic ation on the primary 
endpoint  (without major protocol violations or deviations ). Key protocol deviation 
categories that would influence the decision to include a subject in the PP population at 
time of final review before study database lock will be pre -specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) .   
Sample Size : The sample size was calculated based on  results of a Phase 2 study with orally 
administered DFD -29 (40 mg) in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of papulopustular 
rosacea.  Based on the sample size calculations and an assumed dropout rate of 20%, the final 
planned sample size is  120 subjects each in t he DFD -29 and D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg groups  
and 80 subjects in the placebo group for a total of 320 subjects. This sample size will provide adequate power to assess the superiority of DFD -29 against both placebo and D oxycycline  
capsules  40 mg  in terms of efficacy on both co -primary endpoints.

6.1 Background  
Rosacea is a chronic relapsing inflammatory cutaneous disorder, primarily of the convexities of 
the central face (cheeks, chin, nose, and central forehead). The main clinical forms of the disease are erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (subtype 1), papulopustular rosacea (subtype 2), phymatous rosacea (subtype 3), and ocular rosacea (subtype 4) [ 25]. In addition to the classification system, 
the National Rosacea Society Expert Committee on the Classification and Staging of Rosacea devised a standard method for assessing gradations of the severity of rosacea [ 26]. This standard 
grading system is essential to perform research, analyze results, and compare data; provides a common reference for diagnosis, treatment, and assessment of results in clinical practice; and is the basis for the Investigator’s Global Assessment in rosacea.  
The accurate incidence of rosacea is not known but it is estimated by the National Rosacea Society of the US  that 16 million Americans suffer from the signs and symptoms of rosacea, and millions  
more may be in temporary remission [ 17]. An earlier preliminary study conducted in the US in 
2993 women aged between 10 and 70 years found a prevalence rate for rosacea of 16 % in 
Caucasian women and an overall rosacea incidence of nearly 10 % in the total population including 
Hispanics, African -Americans, Asians , and Indians [ 23]. A recent epidemiological study estimated 
an overall incidence for diagnosed rosacea of 1.65 per 1000 person -years in the United Kingdom 
[18]. In 3052 and 3013 subjects aged between 18 and 65 years drawn from the general populations 
of Germany and Russia , respectively, the prevalence of rosacea was found to be 12.3% ( 95% 
confidence interval [ CI], 10.2- 14.4)  in Germany and 5.0% ( 95% CI, 2.8- 7.2) in Russia [ 21]. In a 
Swedish study in a non- selected population of 809 office employees (454 women and 309 men), 
81 people  were diagnosed as having rosacea giving a prevalence of 10% (women 14%, men 5%) 
[2]. In a cross -sectional study of 348 subjects randomly selected from a working population ≥ 30 
years of age in Estonia, 78 (22%) had one or more primary features of rosacea [ 1]. Rosacea is a 
chronic skin condition that disproportionately affects fair -skinned persons of European and Celtic 
origin.  
The pathogenesis of rosacea is poorly understood. Contributing factors may include immune and inflammatory abnormalities, vascular alterations, neurogenic dysregu lation, presence of cutaneous 
microorganisms, ultraviolet (UV) damage, and skin barrier dysfunction [ 10, 14, 20, 24, 27]. 
Clinical features and trigger factors of rosacea indicate a complex dysregulation of inflammatory, vascular, and neuronal systems at an early stage. Elevated levels of antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidins), processing enzymes (epidermal serine protease kallikrein 5), proinflammatory 
cytokines, and toll -like receptors (TLR) seem to play a role in maintaining chronic inf lammation 
in rosacea, which may induce modification of dermal structures mediated by vascular changes and collagen degeneration. Complex vascular mechanisms contribute to local vasodilation, angiogenesis , and tissue fibrosis in rosacea. The involvement of the nervous system is supported 
by the fact that symptoms of rosacea are triggered when subjects are under emotional stress. 
Consistent with its immuno -inflammatory and neurovascular pathophysiology, rosacea was found 
to be associated with several autoimmu ne diseases [ 8], with cardiovascular disease risk factors and 
cardiovascular diseases [ 7, 15], with migraine [ 19], and with a 2-  to 5- fold increased risk of 
depression and anxiety disorders [ 9, 13]. In addition, almost half of the rosacea subjects report a 
significant impairment in their quality of life [ 3, 21]. Tak ing into consideration these findings and 
that about 50% of the subjects rece ive no rosacea care, effective treatment might contribute not

Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  only to symptomatic relief, but also to reduce cardiovascular risk and to improve the emotional 
health and the quality of life of subjects with rosacea.  
Oral tetracyclines, especially doxycy cline and minocycline, have been a cornerstone of systemic 
treatment in rosacea. Independently of their antibacterial properties, tetracyclines at low doses exert anti -inflammatory effects, decrease matrix metalloproteinase activity involved in kallikrein 
activation, act as oxygen scavengers, and improve epidermal barrier function. All of these 
biological activities could contribute to the effectiveness of low -dose tetracyclines in rosacea 
treatment. The use of tetracyclines was also found to be associated with  a decreased incidence of 
vascular disease in veterans with rosacea [ 6]. 
Details about specific benefits and risks for subjects participating in this  study  may be found in the 
accompanying consent documents  for this study .  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, G ood Clinical Practice (GCP) , and 
all applicable regulatory requirements.  
6.2 Rationale  for the Study and Study Design  
6.2.1 Study  Rationale  
This is a P hase 3 multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, active and placebo -
controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral DFD -29 (Minocycline 
Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules) , 40 mg  (hereafter r eferred to as DFD -29) for the 
treatment of papulopustular rosace a over 16 weeks.   
Papulopustular rosacea is the second most common form of the disease and represents a more inflammatory subtype . Papulopustular rosacea is characterized by persistent central  facial 
erythema with transient papules or pustules or both in a central facial distribution, but it can also present with telangiectasias (usually masked by its typical manifestations) and can occur 
concomitantly with acne vulgaris [ 25, 27]. Although multiple therapeutic options are available for 
the treatment of papulopustular rosacea, the most widely used systemic agents are oral tetracycline derivatives, particularly doxycycl ine and minocycline. 
The main concern with the long -term use of tetracyclines in rosacea has been antibacterial 
resistance. However, the recent findings that tetracyclines exert anti -inflammatory effects and 
seem to be effective in papulopustular rosacea a t low sub- antimicrobial doses opens new options 
for its clinical use in this indication that warrant further investigation [ 10, 11, 12, 22]. Doxycycline 
and minocycline show a variety of biological actions independent of their antibiotic activity, including scavenging of oxygen radicals, anti -inflammatory and anti -apoptotic actions, and 
inhibition of proteolysis, angiogenesis , and tumor growth. Tetracyclines may reduce the 
inflammation associated with rosacea by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases involved in kallikrein activation [ 10, 11, 12].  
Minocycline modulates glutamate -induced excitotoxicity and has anti -apoptotic, antioxidant, anti -
inflammatory , and neuroprotective effects that proved beneficial in experimental models of 
various diseases with an inflammatory basis, including dermatological, autoimmune, vascular, psychiatric, and neurological conditions, for which it has been postulated as an adjunctive therapy 
[4, 11, 12]. The lack of photosensitivity represents a potential advantage of minocycline for the 
treatment of papulopustular rosacea because doxycycline exhibits a dose -related phototoxicity [ 5]. 
Minocycline demonstrated benefit in the treatment of inflammatory lesions in subjects with rosacea [ 16, 22] and proved remarkably effective in decreasing serum C -reactive protein (CRP) 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 17 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  levels in other conditions [ 18]. However, the dose -related efficacy of minocycline at sub -
antimicrobial doses in improving the clinical symptoms and reducing serum CRP in 
papulopustular rosacea has  not been investigated.  
Dr. Reddy’s completed a P hase 2 study in November 2018, which evaluated  the efficacy, safety , 
and tolerability of DFD -29 for the treatment of papulopustular  rosacea over 16 weeks , in Germany. 
This study demonstrated a significantly greater efficacy with DFD -29 (40 mg and 20 mg) 
compared to placebo, and with DFD 29 (40 mg) compared to Ora ycea® (Doxycycline Capsules  
40 mg) ( EU product ). Based on the assessment of clinical and laborat ory adverse events (AEs) as 
well as all other safety parameters, DFD -29 developed by Dr. Reddy´s Laboratories Ltd. was safe 
and well tolerated.  
This Phase 3 study is intended to provide efficacy data across a larger study population with 
approximately 29 study centers in the US  and Europe  (Poland and Germany) . There will be 
approximately 15 study centers in the US , 4 in Poland, and 10 in Germany.  
6.2.2 Dose Selection  
The proposed dose strength of DFD -29 to be evaluated in this study is 40 mg. The safety, efficacy , 
and tolerability of DFD -29 at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg were evaluated in the  Phase 2 study  
referenced above . Based on the assessment on the clinical and laboratory AEs  as well as other 
safety parameters, DFD -29 (40 mg) demonstrated no significant  safety or tolerability issues and 
therefore is considered to be safe and well tolerated when used in subjects with  rosacea. 
Minocycline, along with doxycycline and tetracycline, has found a place in dermatologists’ therapeutic armamentarium for treatment of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) in subjects with moderate to severe rosacea; however, only a sub-antimicrobial dose of doxycycline 
has been approved in the US for this  indication. 
The selection of  DFD -29 doses lower than the approved minocycline dose is based on the lower 
protein binding and higher lipophilicity of minocycline compared to doxycycline, which is expected to lead to higher tissue penetration and exposures of minocycline than those achieved with the 40 mg oral dose of doxycycline used for rosacea. Assuming comparable 
anti-inflammatory effects, similar or higher exposure of minocycline achieved using the proposed 
DFD -29 doses is  postulated to translate into efficacy that is better than t hat seen with doxycycline 
40 mg.

randomized to one of the following treatment gro ups: 
• DFD -29 (Minocycline HCl Extended Release Capsules ), 40 mg once daily for 16 weeks  
(DFD -29) 
•  Doxycycline  capsules 40 mg once daily for 16 weeks  * 
• Placebo capsules once daily for 16 weeks   
* An authorized generic of Oracea (Doxycycline capsules 40 mg)  in the United States  
(marketed by – Prasco Laboratories, Mason OH 45040 USA)  will be used as the active 
comparator product.  
Subject visits are scheduled at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Clinical 
assessments of efficacy will be conducted based on Investigator’s Global Assessment  modified 
scale without erythema (IGA ), Clinician’s Erythema Assessment (CEA), and total inflammatory 
lesion count at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 compared  to Baseline.  
Laboratory assessments o f blood (he matology and biochemistry) and urine (routine tests) will be 
conducted at Screening and Week 16 ( end of study  [EOS] or early termination ) to assess for any 
changes in the safety parameters. Other safety assessments include vital signs, physical examination , urine pregnancy tests (for females of  childbearing potential), and collection of AE  
data.  
The i mpact of the treatment on the quality of l ife (QoL) of the subjects will be assessed  using the 
rosacea- specific tool RosaQoL in addition to the Dermatology Lif e Quality Index ( DLQI ) at 
Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. 
The study design is appropriate for the indication studied. Validated methods of data collection, 
analysis, and evaluation will be used for the study . 
8.2 Beginning and End of Study  
A subject is  considered to be enrolled in the study when he/she  has provided written informed 
consent  and has been randomized to study medication. 
A subject is considered to have completed the study after he/she has completed  Visit 7 (Week  16). 
A subject is considered to have discontinued after he/she  has withdrawn consent  or has been 
discontinued under the conditions specified in Section 8.3.3. A subject is considered to have been lost to follow -up if he/she  cannot  be contacted by the 
investigator. The investigator will document efforts to attempt to reach the subject twice by 
telephone and will send a certified letter before considering the  subject lost to follow -up. The end 
of participation for a subject lost to follow -up is documented as the delivery /return  date of the 
certified letter . 
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including serious adverse events 
(SAEs), starting immediately after the subject has signed the informed consent  form (ICF). Each 
subject will be followed for safety monitoring  until he/she is discharged from the study. Follow -up 
procedures related to pregnancy , AEs , or SAEs may continue beyond the end of the study.

8.3.3 Subject Discontinuation Criteria  
A subject may discontinue from the study at any time for any reason. 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 24 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  A subject will be discontinued from the study if his/her  safety or well-being is determined to be at 
risk. Discontinuation will be made at the discretion of the investigator or at the subject’s request. 
A subject must be discontinued from the study  and study m edication  for any of the following 
reasons:  
• The subject or legal r epresentative withdraws consent  
• The subject becomes pregnant  
• The subject’s medication code is unblinded 
• There is a significant protocol violation or non- compliance with the protocol  
A subjec t may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• AE, including intercurrent illness, for which the subject desires to discontinue treatment or 
the investigator determines that it is in the subject’s best interest to be discontinued  
• Condition worsens and requires alternative or supplemental therapy for treatment of 
rosacea  during the study  
• Noncompliant use of the study medication  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Investigator discretion  
Discontinuation is permanent; after a subject has been discontinued, he/she will not be allowed to enroll again.  
If a subject is discontinued from the study for any reason, the Visit 7 (EOS  or early termination) 
procedures should be completed and any outstanding data and study medication should be collected. D ata, including the date and primary reason for discontinuation, must be documented 
on the EOS  electronic case report form (e CRF) and source document.  
If a subject discontinues the study at any time due to an AE, the reason for discontinuation, the nature of the AE, and its clinical course must be fully documented. The investigator must strive to 
follow the subject until the AE has resolved, become clinically insignificant, is stabilized, or the subject is lost to follow -up. For any SAE, follow procedures provided in Section  8.9.6. 
Subjects with protocol deviations should not be withdrawn automatically unless there is a safety concern. The protocol deviation should be recorded in the subject’s case record form and included in the study report. Other than safety reasons, a ny decision by the Investigator to discontinue a 
subject from the study for reasons of violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria or protocol deviations  
should be discussed with the CRO/Sponsor medical monitor, as far as possible, prior to discontinuing the subject. 
As far as possible, investigators must advise subjects to refrain from consuming the prohibited 
medication (as specified in Table 8.1.). In case a subject consumes a prohibited concomitant medication or needs to take one, a joint decision will be taken by the CRO medical monitor and Sponsor medical monitor on whether or not t he subject should continue in the study or be 
withdrawn, depending upon the potential for harmful drug -drug interaction and influence on study 
efficacy assessments. The investigator must communicate information about the drug taken/required by subject, inc luding its generic name, dose and duration of treatment and reason 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 25 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  for subject taking/being advised to take the drug, as soon as it comes to his/her knowledge, to CRO 
Project Manager . The CRO Project Manager  in turn should forward the information to CRO and 
Sponsor medical monitors for a decision on continuation of the subject to be taken. 
Subjects who experience an AE resulting in or requiring discontinuation of study product use 
should be encouraged to be followed up in the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized.  
Subjects whose treatment randomization is unblinded by the study site should stop the study treatment immediately and be withdrawn from the study after follow -up. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the study product will be discontinued immediately, and she will be followed through the pregnancy and delivery. Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report Form and the sponsor should be notified immediately. 
If the spo nsor terminates or suspends the study, the investigator or his/her designee should 
promptly inform the I RB/I EC (and/or regulatory authorities where required) of a temporary halt 
including the reason for such an action. 
8.3.4 Replacement of Subjects  
A subject who  discontinues from the study  after having received at least one dose of study 
medication  will not be replaced . 
8.4 Treatments  
The investigator will take responsibility  for and will take all steps to maintain appropriate records 
and ensure appropriate supply, handling, storage, distribution, and use of study materials in 
accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws  and regulations. 
8.4.1 Dosage and Formulations

MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  8.4.2 Method of Treatment Assignment, Randomization, and/or Stratification  
Upon screening, t he subject will be assigned a unique 7- digit subject number  preceded by the letter 
“S”, wh ere the first 4 digits are the site number and the last 3 digits will be a subject number that 
increments sequentially at the site (i.e ., S1001- 001, S1001- 002).   At the Baseline Visit (Visit 
2/Day 1 ), subjects eligible fo r participation will retain  the same subject number without the letter 
“S” preceding it (i.e., 10 01-001, 1001- 002).  All subjects will retain this subject number for the 
remainder of the study.  Each subject will be dispensed a total of 4 bottles and will be randomly 
assigned a unique bott le number at each visit study medication is dispensed (Visit 2/Day 1, Visit 
4/Day 29, Visit 5/Day 57 and Visit 6/Day 85), using the  Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS).  
Subjects who satisfy all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 
3:3:2 ratio to the DFD -29, D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg , or P lacebo group, respectively .  
Randomization will be stratified by site . Stratification will be ma naged via the I WRS. 
8.4.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
The study medication  will be taken at a fixed time of the day once a day for 16 consecutive weeks. 
The preferred time of administration will be in the morning, after an overnight fast. One c apsule 
of the assigned study medication  will be swallowed with 240 mL (1 glass) of still water on an 
empty stomach.  
Substances that can potentially interfere with absorption of minocycline like antacids, 
multivitamins , or other products containing aluminum, magnesium and calcium, oral iron 
preparations, bismuth subsalicylate , and milk and other dairy products should be avoided from 1.5 
hours before to 3.0 hours after intake of study medication . 
The dosage regimen in this study is that approved for D oxycycl ine capsules  40 mg  [28].  
8.4.4 Blinding of Study Medication  
A double -blind technique will be used. DFD- 29, its matching placebo , and Doxycycline  capsules  
40 mg  are indistinguishable after over -encapsulation. The investigator and study staff (including 
lab personnel), the subjects, the monitors, medical monitors, the CRO personnel involved in clinical operations , and the s ponsor’s staff will remain blinded to the treatment until study closure.  
See Section 8.9.7.4  for a description of the method of unblinding a subject during the study  if such 
action is  warranted.  
8.4.5 Meth od of Packaging, Labeling, Storage, and Dispensing  
Study medications will be supplied in high -density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles containing 
35 capsules each. Bottles will be individually labeled and  packaged so that neither the subject nor 
the investigator can identify the treatment.  
Each subject will be  dispensed a total of 4 bottles and will be  randomly assigned a unique bottle 
number at each visit study medication is dispensed (Visit 2/Day 1, Visit 4/Day 29, Visit 5/Day 57 and Visit 6/Day 85) , using the IWRS. 
At the Visit 2/Day 1 , each subject enrolled will receive 1 bottle  of study medication. At Visits 
4/Day 29 , 5/Day 57 , and 6/Day 85 , the study medication will be collected,  and 1 new bottle  of 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 28 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  study medication will be dispensed.  Study medic ation will be collected and re -dispensed at Visit 
3/Day 14.  
A label  with a tear -off portion will be attached to each bottle .  The tear -off section of the label will 
be attached to the S tudy Medication Dispensing Log when a new bottle is dispensed.  To null ify 
any remaining differences in product packaging and to maintain double -blinding, the 
investigator/sub -investigator performing the study clinical assessments will not be involved with 
the dispensing or return of study medication.   
At the minimum, the following information will be stated on the labels:  
• Study number (DFD -29-CD-005) 
• EudraCT Number (Europe only)  
• Visit No.  
• Bottle number  
• Subject number and initials  (US only)  
• Amount (35 capsules of either  DFD- 29 40 mg / Placebo / D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg ) 
• Batch Number and Expiry Date (Europe only)  
• Name of Investigator (Europe only)  
• Sponsor’s Name and Address  
• CRO’s Name and Address  
• Route of administration (e.g., oral)  
• Directions for use  
• Storage conditions  
• “For clinical trial use only” or similar cautionary s tatement  
• “Keep out of reach of children” or similar cautionary statement  
All study medication will be stored at controlled room temperature  68° - 77°F ( 20° - 25°C) with 
excursions permitted between 59° - 86°F ( 15° - 30°C), in a climate -controlled, limited access area.  
The investigator agrees to store and dispense the study medication only at the site(s) listed on Form 
FDA 1572 (or investigator agreement/statement). The investigator, sub- investigator(s), or 
qualified designees also agree that the study medication will be dispensed only to subjects who have provided written informed consent and have met all entry criteria. Clinical supplies may not be used for any purpose other than as stated in the protocol. 
See the Study Flow Chart in  Section  3.2 for a schedule of when clinical supplies are to be dispensed 
to the subjects. 
8.4.6 Replacement of Study Medication 
If replacement  bottles are needed  for subjects for any reason, this will be done through IWRS.  T he 
study site should contact the CRO  to provide information regarding replacement bottles  for 
documentation purposes . 
8.4.7 Study Medication Accountability  
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and partially used study medication at all protocol -
specified visits for study medication inventory and assessment of subject compliance.  
All IP receipts at the site will be confirmed via IWRS and final IP reconciliation and returns will 
be conducted via IWRS, at study end. The dispensing and return of study medication for subjects 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 29 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  will be recorded on the study medication dispensing log. The subject number/initials and the 
initials and date of the person dispensing and receiving the returned medication  will be 
documented on this form. 
Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by the study  monitor and/or auditor, and 
open to inspection by regulatory authorities  at any time.  
8.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications and other trea tments taken by the subject within 30 days before signing the ICF 
and during the study are to be recorded on the e CRF using their generic name, if known, with the 
corresponding indication. The medications to be recorded include prescription and OTC 
medicat ions and dietary supplements. All medications taken on a regular basis, including vitamins, 
aspirin , and acetaminophen, should be recorded prior to first  use of the study medication. 
The use of any concomitant medication must relate to the subject’s docume nted medical history, 
prophylaxis, or an AE.  
8.4.8.1 Medications, Supplem ents, and Other Substances Prohibited Before Study Entry  and 
During the Study  
The medications prohibited prior to Baseline are listed in  Table 8.1 in the  exclusion criteria.  
The medications and therapies listed in Table 8.1  are the treatments that subjects must not take 
during the study, from Visit 2 through Visit 7 (EOS or early termination) . 
Substances which can potentially interfere with absorption of minocycl ine like antacids, 
multivitamins or other products containing aluminum, magnesium and calcium, oral iron 
preparations, bismuth subsalicylate and milk and other dairy products should be avoided from 1.5 hours before to 3.0 hours after intake of study drug.  
Anti-microbial soaps and face wash  are not allowed during the study.  
In case a subject consumes a prohibited concomitant medication or needs to take one, a joint 
decision will be taken by the CRO medical monitor and Sponsor medical monitor on whether or not the subject should continue in the study or be withdrawn, depending upon the potential for harmful drug -drug interaction and influence on study efficacy assessments. 
 
8.4.8.2 Other Restrictions  
8.4.8.2.1 Sun Exposure  
Excessive sun exposure and/or UV radiation should be avoided, and protective measures should be taken.  
8.4.8.2.2 Contraceptives  
Special attention has to be paid to female subjects taking low dose oral contraceptives (35 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol or equivalent dose of other estrogens) as their effectiveness 
may b e affected by the use of DFD -29. To avoid contraceptive failure, female subjects who are 
taking low dose oral contraceptives  have to use a second acceptable form of contraceptive from 
Screening up to 1 month after last dose.

MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  Note:  ‘Acceptable’ method s of c ontraception include double barrier methods (e.g. a combination 
of male condom with either, cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide) in addition to the 
“highly effective birth control methods that are described in Section  8.3.1, inclusion criterion 
1011.  
Please refer to inclusion criterion 10 (Section  8.3.1) for further details on contraception for 
females.  
8.4.8.3 Concomitant Medications, Supplements, and Other Substances Allowed During the 
Study 
Medications ne cessary for the health and well -being of the subject are permitted . The use of any 
medication that could affect the course of rosacea  is prohibited during the entire study period.  
Subjects should be instructed to refrain from making any significant change in the use of consumer 
products (including facial cleanser, make -up, bland non- medicated emollients or moisturizers, 
etc.) during the course of the study. 
Multivitamins and acetaminophen for pain relief may be  used as needed throughout the study. 
8.4.9 Assessment of Compliance 
At all protocol -specified visits, the investigator or qualified designee will record whether treatment 
had been taken per protocol in the preceding interval. If not, the date(s) and reason for each dosing noncompliance must be recorded. 
Compliance will be d etermined from the diary card, on which the subject will be instructed to 
record all doses taken  or missed . The number of doses  will be totaled by the study coordinator  or 
designee and recorded on the diary  card and on the compliance page of the e CRF. The total number 
of doses taken  and/or missed will be determined based upon the first dose taken  through and 
including the last dose taken . The first and last dates of treatment should be recorded  in the e CRF. 
The total of taken  and missed doses should also be recorded. By definition, there are no missed 
doses before the first date of treatment or  after the last date of treatment.  Subjects will be 
considered compliant if they administer at least 80% and no more than 120% of doses. Subjects 
who miss 7 or more consecutive doses of study medication will be considered noncompliant and 
must be withdrawn from the study by the investigator in agreement with the CRO/ Sponsor medical 
monitor. 
8.5 Study Schedule  
The visit -by-visit schedule of study activities is provided in the Study Flow Chart in Section  3.2. 
The timing of each visit is relative to Day 1.  
All visits should be performed within the windows specified on the Study Flow Chart. Every 
attempt should be made to have each subject attend each visit as scheduled. If a subject is unable 
to attend a visit within the specified window, however, the visit should be scheduled as closely as 
possible to the applicable window. 
8.6 Study Procedures  
The Study Flow Chart in Section  3.2 summarizes the study proc edures to be performed at each 
visit. Individual study procedures are described below. 
All clinical assessments ( IGA, CEA, and total inflammatory lesion count) must be conducted by 
qualified investigators listed on the Form FDA  1572 ( who have been delegated these tasks by the 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 31 of 63

MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  principal investigator (PI). The PI may delegate this task to physicians, physician assistants, or 
nurse practitioners who have documented training and past experience conducting the assessment.  
To minimize variab ility of evaluations, the same investigator/sub -investigator should perform 
these assessments for any given subject and anticipate evaluating the subject at each visit, to the extent possible.  
8.6.1 Study Initiation  
The investigational staff may not enroll any s ubjects prior to completion of an initiation visit. This 
visit will include, but is not limited to, an inventory of study supplies (if present) and a detailed review of the protocol, eCRF s, investigator ’s brochure , and the investigator’s responsibilities a s 
outlined on Form FDA  1572 / investigator commitments  in an equivalent of Form 1572  (EU sites 
only) . 
8.6.2 Written Informed Consent  
The study personnel will review the ICF with each subject and give the subject an opportunity to have all questions answered before proceeding. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to every 
subject and the original will be maintained with the subject’s r ecords.  
8.6.3 Significant Medical History /Demographic Information  
Significant medical history and demographic information will be obtained at Visit 1 (Screening) . 
The medical history will include a complete review of all current diseases and their respective durations and treatments. Demographic information will include date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity , 
and Fitzpatrick skin type . 
For inclusion in the study subjects must have a clinical diagnosis of papulopustular rosacea, IGA grade 3  (moderate)  or IGA grade 4 (severe) . 
Medical history will be reviewed/updated at Visit 2 (Baseline).  
8.6.4 Physical Examination (Including Vital Signs)  
A complete physical examination will be performed and height, weight, and vital signs recorded at Screening  to determine that the subject is healthy enough to participate in the study. Weight will 
also be measured at Visit  2 (Baseline). Physical examination and weight will also be performed at 
Visit 7 (EOS  or early termination).   
Blood pressure  (measured after at least 5 minutes in a sittin g position) and pulse rate will be 
measured at every study visit, as part of Vital Signs Assessment . 
8.6.5 Prior Medication Review  
Prior medications (prescription, OTC, and dietary supplements), including the necessary washout 
times, will be reviewed with the su bject. A record of prior medication taken or used by the subject 
within 30 days  before signing the ICF will be  obtained. Prior medication will be reviewed/updated 
at Visit 2 (Baseline).  
8.6.6 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory tests for hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis are specified in  Table 8.5. Blood 
samples  for laboratory tests are to be taken prior to administration of study medication. Blood  
(hematology and chemistry)  and urine samples will be collected at Visit 1 (Screening)  and Visit 7

8.6.7 Urine Pregnancy Test  and Acceptable Contraceptive Methods  
Women of childbearing potential, in addition to having a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 
(Screening)  and Baseline , prior to randomization, must be willing to use an acceptable form of 
birth control during the study.  
‘Highly effective’ methods of birth control include 
• combined (estrogen and progesterone  containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation*: o oral 
o intravaginal 
o transdermal  
• progesterone- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation*:

o injectable  
o implantable†  
• intra-uterine device (IUD) †  
• intra-uterine hormone releasing system (IUS) †  
• bilateral tubal occlusion†  
• vasectomy of sexual partner that was performed at least 90 days prior to Baseline, 
and has been medically assessed as successful†  
• total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) sexual abstinence  
o Note: Sexually inactive female subjects may be enrolled at the investigator’s 
discretion provided that they are counseled to refrain from heterosexual intercourse for the duration of the study and for one month after the last dose, and understand the possi ble risks involved in getting pregnant during the study. 
*    Hormonal methods: If on hormonal contraceptives, must have been on the same hormonal contraceptive product for 3 months (90 days) prior to Baseline and continued on same method and dose throughout the duration of the study. If subject had used hormonal birth control and had stopped, this should have occurred more than 6 months prior to Baseline. Female subjects on low dose oral contraceptives (containing ≤35 µg of ethinyl estradiol or equivalent dose of other estrogens) must use a second form of contraceptive during the study.  
† Contraception methods that are considered to have low user dependency.  
A urine pregnancy test will be performed for women of child- bearing potential at every study visit 
from Screening up to Week 16 (or at early termination if previous pregnancy testing was performed 
more than 28 days prior)
. 
8.6.8 Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA)  
The IGA (Appendix  15.1) is carried out by visual inspection by the investigator or delegated sub-
investigator at every study visit from Screening through Week 16 ( EOS  or early termination).  If 
possible, the same study staff member should perform the assessment on an individual subject at all visits.  
8.6.9 Clinician’s Erythema Assessment (CEA)  
The CEA (Appendix  15.2) is carried out by visual inspection by the investigator or delegated sub -
investigator at every study visit from Screening through Week 16 ( EOS  or early termination). The 
erythema assessment will be carried out separately at 5 locations on the face:  forehead, nose, chin, 
right cheek, and left cheek.  A ≥ 2-grade reduction from Baseline to Week 16 will be assessed on 
the most severe CEA score/s out of the 5 locations on the face. If more than one location have the most severe scores, then the ≥ 2-grade reduction has to be on the aver age scores for those locations 
at Week 16 (for e.g. if the baseline CEA scores for the right and left cheeks are 3, the nose is 1 and the forehead and chin are 0 each, the baseline average score is equal to 3 for the right and left cheeks, then the average of the scores for the two cheeks at Week 16 has to be ‘1’ or below, to be 
considered as at least a 2 -grade reduction on the CEA). Subjects with a ≥ 2-grade reduction in the

Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  worst affected area/s, who show  worsen ing (i.e., increases) by >1 grade  over Baseline in one or 
more of the other facial locations , will be considered treatment non- responders for the primary 
analysi s of this  endpoint and considered treatment responders for the supportive analyses . 
8.6.10  Total Inflammatory Lesion Count  
The total in flammatory lesion count is carried out by visual inspection by the investigator or 
delegated and trained study staff at every study visit from Screening through Week 16 ( EOS  or 
early termination). Inflammatory lesions will be recorded on a diagram of a hum an face 
(Appendix  15.3)  divided in 4 quadrants. If possible, the same study staff member should perform 
the assessment on an individual subject at al l visits.  
8.6.11  Rosacea Quality of Life (RosaQoL)  
The RosaQoL assessment (Appendix  15.4) will be carried out by asking questions as per the 
validated RosaQoL questionnaire instrument at every study visit from Baseline  through Week  16 
(EOS  or early termination). Subjects will rate 21 questions on a 5- grade scale and their perception 
of the impact that r osacea has on various dimensions influencing their quality of life.   Calculation 
of the score will be described in the SAP. 
8.6.12  Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
The DLQI questionnaire (Appendix  15.5) w ill be carried out at every study visit from Baseline  
through Week 16 (EOS  or early termination).  
The DLQI questionnaire consists of 10 questions covering the following topics: symptoms, 
embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, s port, work or study, close 
relationships, sexuality and treatment. Each question refers to the impact of the skin disease on the subject’s life.  
Each question is scored from 0 to 3 and totaled, giving a possible score range from 0 (meaning no impact of ski n disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).  
8.6.13  Review Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee to ensure that the subject qualifies for the study.  
8.6.14  Study Medication Dispensing and Collection  
An independent  drug dispenser , not involved in the clinical evaluations, will dispense study 
medication to qualified subjects and keep accurate accountability of all study medication. Study medication will be dispensed at Visits 2, 4, 5, and 6 and bottles will be collected at Visits 3, 4, 5, 
6, and 7 to assess compliance and drug accountability.
 Study medication will be collected and re-
dispensed at Visit 3.  
8.6.15  Subject Instruction, Diary Card, and Compliance   
Subjects will be instructed on the correct use of study medication at the study site during Visit 2 (Baseline) . Subjects will be instructed to take study medication at a fixed time of the day once a 
day for 16 consecutive weeks. The preferred time of adm inistration will be in the morning, after 
an overnight fast. One capsule of the assigned study medication  will be swallowed with 240 mL 
(1 glass) of still water on an empty stomach . Additional  instructions will be reviewed with each 
subject.

MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  A diary card w ill be dispensed to each enrolled subject at Visit 2 (Baseline) . The subject will be 
instructed to complete the diary  card to record each dose  or missed dose  of study medication. At 
subsequent visits , study personnel will review and collect the diary  card, and dispense a new diary 
card and re- review subject instructions .  
8.6.16  Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  Assessment  
See Section  8.9 for instructions on the assessment and reporting of AEs and SAEs and 
Section  8.9.6 for instructions on reporting SAEs to the s ponsor  or designee . 
8.6.17  Concomitant Medication Review  
Medications, including prescription, OTC , and dietary supplements (other than study medication) 
taken and other treatments used by the subject during the study will be reviewed at each study 
visit.  
8.6.18  Study Medication Accountability  
Adherence to study medications will be assessed by  the study diary  review , pill count  and subject 
questioning at all visits d uring the treatment period. The investigator or other designated study 
personnel will note in the source documents and appropriate  eCRF page whether the subject took 
study medication per protocol in the preceding interval.  
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and partially used bottles of study medication at Visits 
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 for study medication inventory and assessment of subject compliance.  The site 
staff will count and record the number of remaining cap sules  in each returned bottle . 
All IP receipts at the site will be confirmed via IWRS and final IP reconciliation and returns will be conducted via IWRS, at study end. The dispensing and return of study medication for subjects will be recorded on the study  medication dispensing log . The subject number/initials and the 
initials and date of the person dispensing and receiving the returned medication will be documented on this form. 
Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by the study  monito r and/or auditor, and 
open to inspection by regulatory authorities  at any time.

8.7.5 COVID- 19 Considerations  
As a consequence  to the COVID -19 pandemic that had a worldwide impact, including cases in 
North America and Europe, control measures in place in different regions may impact the ability 
to adhere to some of the study procedures described in this protocol. Due to challenge s that include, 
but are not limited to, subject preferences, site closures, travel restrictions, and quarantines, some modifications to study conduct during the COVID -19 pandemic may be necessary to ensure study 
continuity. The following are allowable, as necessary, modifications to study conduct during the COVID -19 pandemic.  
• At Screening, if a potential subject is known to be infected with COVID -19, the subject 
should not be enrolled in the study.   
• Prior to a study visit at the site, the subject may be c ontacted and screened for potential 
exposure or infection to COVID -19 per site, local or federal requirements. If the subject is 
suspected to be exposed or infected with COVID -19, the on- site visit should either be re -
scheduled or a virtual visit may be pe rformed instead, as applicable.  
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 38 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  • In the event that a subject cannot attend their regularly scheduled study visits in person due 
to COVID -19 due to quarantine, state COVID rules, etc. necessitating a limit on in -person 
contact, the Investigator may perform safety and certain efficacy assessments by phone or 
video (see below) . The Investigator may use the technology platform that is currently 
available to them. Suggested platforms include Apple FaceTime, Zoom for Healthcare, Facebook Messenger video chat, Mic rosoft Team s, Google Hangouts video, Skype , or any 
other platform, which is suitable from a technology and data protection perspective, as determined by the site .   
o Screening, Baseline and Week 16 / End of Study/ Early Termination  visits must be 
conducted in- person. The  efficacy assessments of T otal Inflammatory Lesion 
count, IGA grading, and CEA grading as well as the Quality of Life assessment of DLQI scoring at Baseline and Weeks 16  visits  must be performed in -person.  
o Visits at Week s 2, 4, 8 and 12 may be conducted in- person or as virtual ly (using 
suitable technology platform).  
• Source documentation should note that the visit was performed virtually (not face -to-
face).   If certain study procedures or assessments cannot be completed per the schedule of 
events, the reason for the missed assessment  must be noted in the source documentation 
(e.g., COVID -19), captured in the protocol deviations documentation, and reported to the 
IRB/ IEC, as applicable.  
A detailed assessment of C OVID -19 related risk and mitigation measures will be documented in 
the appropriate study plans. 
8.8 Efficacy Assessments

8.9 Assessment of Safety  
8.9.1 Safety Endpoints  
The following parameters have been defined as param eters regarding safety and tolerability:  
• Change from Baseline for vital signs and clinical laboratory tests.  The clinical laboratory 
tests obtained at screening visit will be defined as baseline assessments.   
• Treatment -emergent AEs . 
• Treatment -emergent AEs  leading to premature discontinuation of study medication . 
• Treatment -emergent SAEs.  
8.9.2 Definition s of Terms  
8.9.2.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug -related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an y AE temporally associated with the use of a study drug, 
whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
AEs will be collected by spontaneous reports from subjects, either verbal or recorded in the subject’s diary, by directed question of subjects, and by observation. All AEs from the time of signing of the ICF up to the EOS visit will be recorded.  
Adverse events include:  
• Exacerbation of a pre- existing disease.  
• Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre- existing episodic disease or medical condition. 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 40 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  • Disease or medical condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at Baseline that worsen following the start of the study.  
• Events considered by the investigator to be related to study -mandated procedures.  
• Abnormal assessments, e.g., vital signs or physical examination findings, must be reported 
as AEs if they represent a clinically significant finding that was not present  at Baseline or 
worsened during the course of the study.  
• Laboratory test abnormalities must be reported as AEs if they represent a clinically 
significant finding, symptomatic or not, which was not present at Baseline or worsened during the course of the st udy or led to dose reduction, interruption or permanent 
discontinuation of study drug.  
Adverse events do not include:  
• Medical or surgical procedure, e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion. However, the event leading to the procedure is an AE. If this event is serious, the procedure must be described in the SAE narrative.  
• Pre-existing disease or medical condition that does not worsen.  
For the purpose of this study, worsening of  rosacea  is not to be recorded as an AE unless it results 
in discontinuation of the subject from the study or the use of further treatment for rosacea . 
8.9.2.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is defined as any AE for which there is reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE. 
8.9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed or, if an Investigator Brochure  is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described elsewhere (for example, approved prescribing information). 
8.9.2.4 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE or SAR that, in the view of the investigator or sponsor, resul ts in 
any of the following outcomes : 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE (Note: the term “life -threatening” as used here refers to an event that 
in the view of the investigator or sponsor places the subject at immediate risk of death at 
the time of the event; it doe s not include an AE or SAE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 41 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  • Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Any “other” important medical event.  Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The following are not considered an SAE:  
• Treatment on an emergency or outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling the definition of seriousness given above and not resulting in hospitalization.  
• The following reasons for hospitalizations are not considered AEs, and therefore not SAEs:  
o Hospitalizations for cosmetic elective surgery, social and/or convenience  reasons.  
o Standard monitoring of a pre -existing disease or medical condition that did not 
worsen, e.g., hospitalization for coronary angiography in a subject with stable angina pectoris.  
o Elective treatment of a pre -existing disease or medical condition tha t did not 
worsen, e.g., hospitalization for chemotherapy for cancer, elective hip replacement for arthritis  
8.9.2.5 Planned Hospitalization  
A hospitalization planned by the subject prior to signing the ICF is considered a therapeutic 
intervention and not the resul t of a new SAE and should be recorded as medical history. If the 
planned hospitalization or procedure occurs as planned, the record in the subject’s medical history is considered complete.  However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must be 
reported as an AE.  
8.9.2.6 Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring after the first dose of study  medication require immediate reporting and 
discontinuation of the study medication . They must be reported within 24 hours after the 
investigator has become aware of the preg nancy. The subject should immediately be withdrawn 
from the study and early termination study procedures must be performed.  
A pregnancy report will be completed and sent by email to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Clinical 
Pharmacovigilance, the Sponsor medi cal monitor, and the CRO medical monitor within 24 hours  
of becoming aware of the pregnancy. The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of 
the pregnancy should be included in this information. The investigator is instructed to contact the subject every 3 months until the end of her pregnancy and report the outcome to the sponsor. The 
investigator is instructed to contact the subject for 8 weeks after delivery for follow up on infant.  
The investigator will collect follow -up information regardi ng the outcome of the pregnancy and 
any postnatal sequelae in the infant that must also be reported to the Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Clinical Pharmacovigilance, the Sponsor medical monitor, and the CRO medical monitor . Upon 
awareness of the outcome of the pregnancy, the PI or designee must forward a follow -up

Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  Pregnancy Report with any relevant information to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Clinical 
Pharmacovigilance, the Sponsor medical monitor, and the CRO medical monitor .  
If the outcome of the pregnanc y meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investi gator will report 
the event by emailing  a completed SAE report form to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Cli nical 
Pharmacovigilance, the Sponsor medical monitor, and the CRO medical monitor  within 24 hours 
of being notified of the pregnancy report.  
Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report Form.  
The following outcomes of pregnancy fall under the criteria for serious adverse events and should 
be reported as such: delivery complications prolonging hospitalization, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly i n a miscarried/stillborn fetus  
8.9.3 Monitoring Adverse Events  and Laboratory Evaluations  
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs, immediately after the 
subject has signed the ICF . Each subject will be followed for safety monitor ing until discharged 
from the study.  Follow -up procedures related to pregnancy or AEs or SAEs may continue beyond 
the end of the study.  
Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by the investigator or a qualified designee for occurrence of AEs  throughout  the study . The presence or absence of specific AEs should not be 
elicited from subjects.  Subjects having AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments 
and laboratory tests, as determined by the investigator. 
AEs, actions taken as a result of AE s, and follow -up results must be recorded in the e CRF , as well 
as in the subject’s source documentation. Follow -up laboratory results should be filed with the 
subject’s source documentation. For all AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from the study  and SAEs, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests will be repeated as clinically appropriate until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
All laboratory assessments will be performed centrally at a certified laboratory selected  by the 
sponsor. The clinical laboratory values will be reported to the investigator by the laboratory and 
the Investigator  will review them for significance and consideration as an AE. 
8.9.4 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.9.4.1 Assessment of Severity 
Severity of AEs will be graded according to the following definitions:  
Mild: Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does not require intervention. 
Moderate: Event may make subject uncomfortable; performance of daily activities may  be 
influenced; intervention may be needed.  
Severe: Event may cause noticeable discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject 
may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or intervention is usually needed.

Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  8.9.4.2 Assessment of Causality  
AEs should be assessed by the investigator as to whether or not there is a reasonable possibility of 
causal relationship to the study drug and reported as either definite, probable, possible, not related, 
as defined below:  
• Not Related: The event is clearly d ue to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.) or the event is most probably produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant therapy and does not follow a known response pattern to the study product.  
• Possibly Related: The event is temporally related to study product use but can be explained by another etiology. Information on the effect of study product withdrawal may be lacking. 
• Probably Related: The event is temporally related to study  product use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study product and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study product.  
• Definitely Related : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study product administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study product and could not have been produced by other factors such as the subject´s clinical state, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy, and either occurs immediately following study product administration or improves on stopping the product, or there is a positive reaction at the application site  
8.9.5 Reference Safety Information for Assess ing Expectedness of Adverse Events

DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed in the SAE.  
Serious adverse event r eporting will extend from signing of informed consent until End of Study 
Visit /Early Termination visit.  
An SAE which occurs before administration of study drug (e.g. during screening/as a result of 
screening) will not be considered for expedited reporting to the FDA/ local EU regulatory 
authorities  but will be entered in the subject’s source records and the eCRF  
If the subject took one or more suspect medicinal product(s) other than the study drug, the relevant manufacturer(s) of this medicinal product(s), will be informed about the SAE by the sponsor.  
Preliminary reports will be followed by detailed descriptions that should include copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, hospital discharge summaries and other documents when requested and applicable. Follow -up information about a previously reported SAE must also be reported 
within 24 hours of receiving it. The Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department may contact the investigator to obtain further information.  
Suspected (considered related to the st udy drug) and Unexpected (not previously described in the 
reference safety document), Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be expedited by the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department to Health Authorities. The CRO will report to the EC/IRBs as applicable. All SAEs judged to be SUSARs and reportable will be unblinded. SUSAR related unblinding will be performed by the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department as outlined within the Safety Management Plan.  
The Sponsor must notify  the FDA/ local  EU regulatory authorities of any SAE observed during 
conduct of the study, which is serious and unexpected and for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that it has caused the SAE, for which there is basis to believe there is a causal 
relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adver se event , as soon as possible but in 
no case later than 15 calendar days after becoming aware of its occurrence through an IND Safety Report  to the FDA (21 CFR 320.31(d)(3))  or within the timelines  required by local regulations  .  
If the AE is fatal or life -threatening, and with reasonable possibility of its being related to the study 
drug, the Sponsor must also notify the FDA / local  EU regulatory authorities  as soon as possible , 
but in no case later than 7 calendar days after becoming aware of its occurrence to the FDA as per regulatory guidelines (21 CFR 320.31(d)(3)) or  within the timelines required by local regulations . 
Unblinding Instructions:  
Breaking the blind 
The blind should ordinarily be broken for all SAE IND safety report s submitted to FDA/ local  EU 
regulatory  authorities.  
The unblinding procedures and follow -up will be performed in accordance with the protocol and 
the Sponsor’s SOPs. All SAEs observed in the investigational drug group, if considered drug related (Suspec ted 
Adverse Reaction) will be reported to FDA / local  EU regulatory authorities  as an unblinded IND 
Safety Report ,  
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 46 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  If the blind is broken and a subject with an adverse event was receiving placebo, the event should 
not be reported in an IND safety report be cause there is not a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  
The blind should not be broken at the study site level except in a medical emergency (where knowledge of the study drug received would affect the treatment of the emergency ) or regulatory 
requirement (e.g., for SAEs or death).  
For medical emergency, the blind must only be broken following discussion on a case -by-case 
basis, at the discretion of the Investigator/treating physician/sponsor.  
If the blind is broken, the date, t ime, and reason must be recorded in the subject’s source record, 
eCRF, and any associated AE report.  
If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject, is unblinded, the unblinding incident and unblinded subject must be listed as a major protocol deviation.  
A subject for whom the blind is broken will discontinue study product and be scheduled for a safety follow up visit and then discontinued from the study. The subject will be encouraged to stay in the s tudy until the AE is resolved or stabilized.  
For regulatory requirement, reporting of SAEs not previously unblinded at the site level, the blind will be broken by Pharmacovigilance reporting team for all SAEs observed in any treatment arm.  All other indiv iduals, including primary investigators, will receive notification of the SAE in the 
form of a blinded report unless the SAE was previously unblinded at the site level due to a medical emergency.  
Laboratory and Vital Signs Variables  
Vital signs and laborat ory abnormalities should be reported as an AE if they are considered to be 
clinically significant, as per Investigator’s judgment. If an abnormal laboratory value is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom should be reported as an AE and the associated abnormal laboratory result should be considered additional information. 
Subjects who have had an SAE must be followed clinically until  the event has resolved , become 
clinically insignificant, has stabilized, or the subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator must 
provide a written follow -up report as soon as possible when any additional information is received. 
New SAEs occurring at any time after the 30 -day follow -up period after study drug discontinuation 
(whichever comes first) m ay be reported to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Clinical 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the investigator ’s knowledge of the event, if felt appropriate 
by the investigators.  
Such information will only be entered into the drug safety database and hence  will not affect study 
closure.  
8.9.7 Discontinuation, Treatment Interruption, and Unblinding of Blinded Treatment 
Due to Safety Observations  
8.9.7.1 Discontinuation  
See Section  8.3.3 for the criteria for discontinuing a subject.  If a subject is  discontinued early from 
the study , the activities specified for Visit 7 on the Study  Flow Chart ( Section 3.2) should be 
completed if possible . 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 47 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  8.9.7.2 Treatment  Interruption 
A subject may have the study medication  temporarily interrupted for any of the following reasons:  
• An AE  
• A diagnostic or therapeutic pr ocedure  
• An abnormal assessment (e.g., vital signs or laboratory abnormalities)  
• Administrative reasons , in particular withd rawal of the subject’s consent, or subject 
becomes uncooperative.  
The reason for study drug interruption or premature discontinuation must be documented in the 
eCRF and the S ponsor must be informed. If the reason for discontinuation from study drug is an 
abnormal result on a laboratory test or vital sign this information  will be recorded as an AE in the 
eCRF. The subject  will remain under the supervision of the investigator  until sa tisfactory health 
has returned.  
8.9.7.3 Modification of Dose of Study Medication  
The dose of study medication  to any subject may not be modified. If necessary,  a subject must be 
discontinued for the reasons described in Section  8.3.3.  
8.9.7.4 Unblinding Treatment for a Subject During the Study  
IWRS will be used for emergency unblinding. The identity of the study drug may be revealed only 
if the subject experiences a medical emergency whose management would benefit by the knowledge of the treatment assignment. Subjects who have been unblinded by the s tudy site must  
be discontinued from the study.  
The occurrence of any unblinding  during the study must be clearly justified and explained by the 
investigator. Before unblinding , every attempt must be made by the investigator to discuss the 
intended code bre ak with the  Sponsor  Medical Monitor. In all cases, the Sponsor must be informed 
as soon as possible before or after the code break.  
8.10 Criteria for Early Termination of the Study  
There are no prespecified criteria for terminating the study  early.   
Further recruitment in the study  or at (a) particular site(s) may be stopped due to insufficient 
compliance with the protocol, GCP , and/or other applicable regulatory requirements, procedure -
related problems, or the number of discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high.  
9 STATISTIC AL METHODS  
Prior to the database lock, a detailed, finalized Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) will be completed 
and placed on file. The Statistical Analysis Plan will contain a more comprehensive explanation  
than that provided here  of the methodology used in the statistical analyses , as well as  the rules and 
data handling conventions used to perform the analyses and the procedure used to  account for 
missing data.  In case of any conflicting /discrepant information pertaining to statistical analysis 
between the methodology specified hereunder and in the final SAP, the information in the final 
SAP will supersede  the protocol. 
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written and finalized before the study closu re, i.e., 
database closure and unblinding of the randomization code of the study. The SAP will provide full 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 48 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  details of the analyses, level of significance to be used, the data displays and the algorithms to be 
used for data derivations.  
9.2 Analysis Population s 
Three populations are defined for the analyses : 
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) population : This analysis population includes all randomized subjects 
(i.e., assigned to a treatment group) . The ITT population will be the primary population for 
the efficac y analysis.  
• Safety population: This analysis population includes subjects who received at least one  
dose of study medication and had at least one safety assessment post -Baseline. The safety 
population will be used for  analysis of tolerability and safety variables.  
• Per-protocol population (PP): This analysis population comprises all subjects who did not 
violate the protocol in a way that might affect the evaluation of the effect of the study 
medi cation  on the primary endpoint  (without major protocol violations or deviations ). Key 
protocol deviation categories that would influence the decision to include a subject in the PP population at the time of final review before study database lock will be pre- specified 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   
9.3 General  Considerations  
9.3.1 Handling of Missing Data 
All safety analyses will be performed on data available at the time point considered. In summary tables, the number of subjects with missing data will be presented unless otherwise specified. In calculation of percentages, subjects with missing data will not be considered in the numerator or 
denominator unless otherwise specified.  
For the ITT  analysis of the total inflammatory lesion count, IGA, CEA, and DLQI efficacy data, 
in case of missing measurements at Week 16,  multiple imputation (MI) will be used to impute the 
missing values.  
9.4 Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant Medications  
The statistical significance of any treatment group difference in the distribution of categorical variables such as gender will be tested using Cochran–Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test for general 
association adjusted for site. Continuous variables, such as age, will be analyzed using a 2- way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with site and treatment as a fi xed effect.  
Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, number of available observations) will be provided for continuous demographic variables (e.g., age, height, weight). Individual subject listings of demographic data will be provide d. 
Qualitative demographic characteristics (gender, race) will be summarized by counts and percentages. Medical history will be summarized by system organ class ( SOC ) and preferred term  
(PT). Other B aseline subject characteristics (e.g., physical examinati on clinical findings, and 
inclusion/exclusion checklist) will only be listed.  
Distributions of these parameters will be compared between the treatment groups only descriptively. No statistical inference will be performed.

A listing with information about the drug administration will be provided.   Summaries of study 
drug exposure and compliance will be provided.  
9.6 Efficacy Evaluations  
For all endpoints, the comparison of DFD -29 versus placebo will be the p rimary objective of the 
study. Comparison between oral DFD -29 and D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg  will be treated as 
secondary. The ITT will be used to perform all efficacy analyses. The analyses of the co -primary 
endpoints will also be performed on the PP population.  
To maintain the study -wise Type I error rate of 0.05, the multiplicity issue of testing DFD -29 
against placebo and against D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg  for multiple primary and secondary 
endpoints will be addressed through a fixed- sequence method des cribed in the SAP, according to 
a defined sequence for the primary and secondary endpoints.  
9.6.1 Co-Primary Endpoints  
• The proportion of subjects with IGA treatment success (DFD -29 versus placebo) will be 
investigated with a CMH test  for general association adj usted for site . Treatment success 
is defined as having at least a 2 -grade reduction from Baseline with G rade 0 or 1 at Week  
16. 
• The difference between the treatments (DFD -29 versus placebo) in terms of the change 
from Baseline in the total inflammatory les ion count at Week 16 will be tested using an 
Analysis of Covariance (AN COVA) model with treatment and site  included in the model 
as fixed effects, and Baseline total inflammatory lesion count as a covariate . 
9.6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
• Percentage Change in Total inflammatory lesion count (sum of papules, pustules, and 
nodules) from Baseline to Week 16, in the DFD -29 group compared to Placebo will be 
tested using an ANCOVA model with treatment and  site included as fixed effects, and 
Baseline total inflammatory lesion count as a covariate.  
• Proportion of subjects with IGA treatment success (DFD -29 versus D oxycycline  capsules  
40 mg) at Week  16 will be investigated with a CMH test f or general association adjusted 
for site .  
• The difference between treatments (DFD -29 vers us Doxycycline  capsules  40 mg ) in 
change from Baseline in the total inflammatory lesion count at Week 16 will be tested using an ANCOVA model with treatment and site  included in the model as fixed effects, 
and Baseline total inflammatory lesion count as a covariate.  
• Percentage Change in Total inflammatory lesion count (sum of papules, pustules, and nodules) from Baseline to Week 16, in the DFD -29 group compared to Doxycycline 
capsules 40 mg group will be tested using an ANCOVA model with treatment and  site 
included as fixed effects, and Baseline total inflammatory lesion count as a covariate.  
• Proportion of subjects with at least a 2-grade reduction in CEA score from Baseline to 
Week 16 will be investigated with a CMH test f or general association adjust ed for site  
(DFD -29 versus placebo) .

The medical history is coded using the most recent Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version  24.1. 
All AEs and SAEs are coded using the most recent MedDRA version 24.1.  
The treatment -emergent A Es are tabulated by system organ class (SOC), and individual preferred 
terms within each SOC by treatment group. The number and percentage of subjects who experienced A Es coded with the same preferred term and SOC will be summarized by treatment 
group (in descending order according to the incidence in the investigational study drug group). AEs will also be tabulated by severity and by relationship to study d rug. Summary tables will be 
accompanied by individual subject listings broken down by treatment group, including pre -dose 
events.  
SAEs, AE s leading to premature discontinuation of study drug, and A Es of special interest each  
will be listed and summarized similarly to A Es. 
Reasons for death will only be listed.  
Reasons for premature discontinuation of study drug will be listed and summarized by frequency 
tables.  
Individual subject listings of vital signs data, physical examination, and laboratory measurements will be provided. 
Observed values and changes from Baseline in vital sign measurements and laboratory measurements will be summarized at each time point using mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of available observations . 
Standard  numeric laboratory parameters are presented in the units supplied. If needed, a conversion 
will be made to standard units.  
Concomitant medications will be classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary and will be presented in data listings.  
9.8 Other Analyses  
9.8.1 Exploratory Analyses  
Exploratory data -driven analyses may be performed with the caveat that any statistical inference 
will not have any confirmatory value.  All of the following will be compared for DFD -29 versus 
placebo and Doxycycline  capsules  40 mg . 
• Proportion of subjects with IGA treatment success from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 will be investigated with a CMH test f or general association adjusted for site . Treatment 
success is defined as having at least a 2 -grade reduction from Baseline with Grade 0 or 1.

Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  • The difference between treatments  in terms of the change from Baseline in the total 
inflammatory lesion count at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 will be tested using mixed model 
repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, site, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction 
included in the model as fixed effects, Baseline total inflammatory lesion count as a covariate, and the subjects as a random factor . 
• Percentage Change in Total inflammatory lesion count (sum of papules, pustules, and nodules) from Baseline to Week s 2, 4, 8  and 12 will be tested using MMRM with treatment, 
site, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction included in the model as fixed effects, Baseline 
total inflammatory lesion count as a covariate, and the subjects as a random factor  
• The proportion of subjects with at least a 2- grade reduction in IGA score from Baseline to 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 will be investigated with a CMH test f or general association 
adjusted for site . 
• Change in total RosaQoL score from Basel ine to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 will be 
investigated using MMRM with treatment, site, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction 
included in the model as fixed effects, Baseline RosaQoL as a covariate, and the subjects as a random factor . 
• Change in DLQI score from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 will be investigated using MMRM with treatment, site, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction included in the model 
as fixed effects, Baseline DLQI as a covariate, and the subjects as a random factor . 
• Proporti on of subjects with at least a 2 -grade improvement in the CEA score at Weeks 2, 
4, 8, 12 ( and 16, in case of DFD -29 vs D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg  comparison) will be 
investigated with a CMH test f or general association adjusted for site . 
Exploratory analys es for the following subgroups will be performed for the primary endpoints:  
• Males versus females  
• Baseline rosacea severity: moderate (IGA 3) versus severe (IGA 4)  
• Baseline total inflammatory lesion count below versus above the median count  
• Fitzpatrick skin types I -III versus IV -VI 
9.9 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this study was calculated on the basis of the results obtained from the preceding 
Phase 2 study with orally administered DFD -29 (40 mg) in the treatment of inflammatory lesions 
of papul opustular rosacea. 
Assuming a difference in treatment means of 8.5 lesions between the DFD -29 and placebo groups, 
and a common standard deviation of 16.3 for the endpoint of inflammatory lesion count reduction, the sample size required is calculated to be 100 DFD -29 subjects and 65 placebo subjects to 
achieve 90% power, with a two- sided alpha of 0.05, for a 3:2 randomization ratio. 
Assuming the proportion of IGA treatment success will be 0.60 in the DFD -29 group and 0.15 in 
the placebo group, the sample siz e of 100 DFD -29 subjects and 65 placebo subjects will provide 
greater than 99% power to detect a statistically significant difference in these proportion at alpha=0.05 (two -sided) , for a 3:2 randomization ratio.

DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  For the comparisons of DFD -29 to D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg  assuming a difference in treatment 
means of 7.5 lesions and the common standard deviation of 16.3 for the endpoint of inflammatory 
lesion count reduction, the sample size required is calculated to be 101 subjects in each treatment group to achieve 90% power, with a two -sided alpha of 0.05. In addition, the sample size of 
100 subjects per group will yield greater than 90% power to detect a difference in the assumed proportion of IGA success of 0.60 in the DFD -29 group 0.35 in the D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg 
group, using a two -sided alpha of 0.05.  
Based on these sample size calculations and an assumed dropout rate of 20%, the final sample size will be 120 subjects each in the DFD -29 and D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg groups and 80 subjects 
in the placebo group for a total of 320 subjects. This sample size will provide adequate power to assess the superiority of DFD -29 against both placebo and D oxycycline  capsules  40 mg  in terms 
of efficacy on both co -primary endpoints. 
Efforts will be made to minimi ze the dropout rate and to ensure proper follow -up of subjects.

Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  sponsor representative or auditor, and/or FDA representative  or other regulatory authority to 
review th e portion of the subject’s medical record that is directly related to the study.  This shall 
include all study -relevant documentation including medical histor y to verify eligibility, 
admission/ discharge summaries for hospital stays occurring while the subject  is enrolled in the 
study, and autopsy reports if a death occur s during the study.  
As part of the required content of informed consent, each  subject must be in formed that his  or her 
medical chart may be reviewed by the s ponsor, the s ponsor’s authorized representatives, FDA  or 
other regulatory authority . If access to the medical record requires  a separate waiver or 
authorization, it is the investigator’s responsi bility to obtain such permission from the subject in 
writing before the subject is entered into the study. 
10.4 Study Registration  
The study  will be registered by the sponsor on an appropriate free public web site such as 
clinicaltrials.gov, which is a service of the United States National Institutes of Health.   
Additionally the study has been registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register 
(clinicaltrialsregister.eu) under the corresponding Eudra CT number 2021- 005382- 40.     
11 DATA H ANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
11.1 Site Regulatory Documents Required for Initiation  
The s ponsor or designee will receive the following documents prior to the initiation of the study:  
• Completed, signed Form FDA 1572 / investigator commitments in an equivalent of Form 
1572 (EU sites only)  
• Current  curricula vitae, signed and dated, for th e principal investigator  (PI) and 
co-investigators named on Form FDA 1572 / investigator commitments  in an equivalent 
of Form 1572 (EU sites only)  
• Current license(s) of the PI and co -investiga tors named on Form FDA  1572 / investigator 
commitments in an equivalent of Form 1572 (EU sites only)  
• Documentation of IRB /IEC approval of the  study protocol, investigator, and ICF 
• Current IRB/IEC  membership list as applicable  
• A copy of the protocol signature page signe d by the PI

sites on ly) 
• Financial Disclosure  Statement for all individuals named  on Form FDA 1 572/ investigator 
commitments  in an equivalent of Form 1572 (EU sites only)  
11.2 Maintenance and Retention of Records  
The study will be conducted according to GCP  as outlined in ICH guide lines by the FDA  as well 
as any applicable local EU regulatory authorities . It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
maintain a comprehensive and centralized filing system of all relevant documentation. Investigators will be instructed to retain all study records required by the s ponsor  and the 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 54 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  regulations in a secure and safe facility with limited access.  Regulations require retention for a 
period of at least 2 years after marketing approval and notifica tion from the s ponsor. These 
regulatory documents should be retained for a longer period if required by local regulatory 
authorities.   
These records include documents pertaining to the receipt and return of drug supplies, IRB /IEC, 
informed consent, source documents, and final signed e CRFs . No documents shall be transferred 
from the site or destroy ed without first notifying the s ponsor.  
11.2.1  Electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRF s)  
Database set -up will be performed by Symbio (CRO)  in collaboration with the e lectroni c data 
capture (EDC) vendor, using an appropriate fully validated, 21 CFR Part 11 as well as any other 
applicable local regulations  compliant EDC system. eCRFs will be provided to each site via a 
secured web link. All applicable study data collected on each subject will be recorded by approved site personnel into the eCRF. Only authorized site personnel will be able to enter/modify/correct 
data to the eCRF.  
Approved staff at CRO  will verify all data entered into eCRFs for completeness and accuracy with 
reference to the source documents and records and will issue manual data queries to correct 
missing data or discrepancies found against the source within the EDC system. 
Data validation will consist of automated and manual edit checks that are created directly  into 
EDC. Automated edit checks will be executed on all data points defined and documented by the 
study team and data management. Study metrics will be reported from the EDC system.  
After all data have been verified by approved staff at CRO , an Investigat or or Sub- Investigator 
(listed on Form FDA 1572 / investigator commitments in an equivalent of Form 1572 (EU sites 
only) ) is required to review and approve all eCRFs prior to database lock and breaking of the blind.  
After database lock, each site will be provided with a transportable media  that will include the 
eCRF data from their site for local archival purposes. 
Quality assurance verification via a 10% database audit of eCRF data will be conducted before the 
treatment assignment codes  are released . 
eCRF  entry  must be kept current to reflect the subject’s status during the study. Subjects are not 
to be identified on eCRFs  by name; appropriately coded identification must be used.  The 
investigator must keep a separate log of the subjects’ names and addresses.  
Source documents such as the clinic chart are to be main tained separately from the e CRF  to allow 
data verification.  Because of the potential for errors, inaccuracies, and ill egibility in transcribing 
data o nto eCRFs, originals of laboratory and other te st results must be kept on file with the 
subject ’s eCRF.  eCRFs, source documents , and copies of test results must be available at all times 
for inspection by the study monitor. The following should also be available for review:  
• Subject Screening Log, which  should reflect the reason any subject screened for the s tudy 
was found to be ineligible  
• Delegation of Authority  Log, which will list a ll site personnel with their responsibilities  as 
delegated by the PI and their signatures.  This log will be maintained at the site throughout 
the study

Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  • Monitoring Log , which will list the date and purpose of all monitoring visits by the s ponsor  
or designee  
• Enrollment Log , which will list subject initials and start and end dates for all enrolled 
subjects  
• Drug Inventory/Packing Slip, which will list the total amount of drug shipped to the site 
and received and  signed for by the investigator  
• Study Medication Dispensing Log , which will list the total amount of study medication 
dispensed to and returned by each subject  
• ICF which must be available for each subject and be ve rified for proper documentation 
• All correspondence  
11.2.2  Primary Source Documents  
The investigator must maintain primary source documents supporting significant data for each 
subject’s medical notes.  These documents, which are considered “source data ,” should include 
documentation of:  
• Demographic information 
• Evidence supporting the diagnosis/condition for which the subject is being studied 
• General information supporting the subject’s participation in t he study  
• General history and physical findings  
• Hospitalization or Emergency Room records (if applicable)  
• Each study visit by date, including any relevant findings/notes by the investigator(s), occurrence (or lack) of AEs , and changes in medication usage, i ncluding the date the study 
medication was started  and stopped 
• Any additional visits during the study  
• Any relevant telephone conversations with the subject regarding the study or possible AEs  
• An original, signed ICF for study participation  
The investigator  must also retain all subject- specific printouts/reports of tests and procedures 
performed as a requirement of the study.  During monitoring visits the monitor will validate e CRF 
entries  against these sources of data.  
11.3 Study Monitoring  
Symbio  (CRO)  will be r esponsible for monitoring the study according to  GCP  and applicable 
regulations. The study will be monitored by a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) in compliance 
with GCP, ICH guidelines, and applicable regulations. The investigator will be visited by a CRA  
prior to the study and at regular intervals during the course of the study. These visits are to  verify 
adherence to the protocol.  The CRA  will review the  ICFs  and verify eCRF entries by comparing 
them with the source documents (hospital/clinic/office rec ords) that will be made available for this 
purpose. The CRA  will review the maintenance of regulatory documentation and drug 
accountability (to the bottle  level).  The monitor will review the progress of the study with the 
Dr. Reddy’s /Journey Medical  Page 56 of 63 
DFD -29-CD-005 Version:  3.0 
MVOR -2 01 November 2022  
Protocol Template  Confidential  MW501.T01 Version 201 9OCT11  investigator and other site personnel  on a regular basis . At the end of the study, a closeout 
monitoring visit will be performed.  Monitoring visits will be arranged with site personnel in 
advance at a mutually acceptable time.  Sufficient time must be allowed by the site personnel for 
the m onitoring of e CRFs and relevant source documents. The coordinator and/or investigator 
should be available to answer questions or resolve data clarifications. Adequate time and space for 
these visits should be made available by the investigator and study staff.   
11.4 Audits and Inspections  
During the course of the study and/or after it has been completed, 1 or more site s may be audited 
by authorized representatives of the s ponsor. The purpose of the audit is to determine whether or 
not the study is being conduc ted and monitored in compliance with recognized GCP/ICH 
guidelines and regulations . 
Additionally, the study may be inspected by regulatory authorities . These inspections may take 
place at any time during  or after completion of  the study and are based on local regulations.  
11.5 Modifications to the Protocol  
The procedures defined in the protocol and e CRF s will be carefully reviewed to ensure that all 
parties involved with the study fully understand the protocol. To ensure the validity of the data, no 
deviations f rom the protocol  (with minimal exceptions ) may be made unless the issue is broad 
enough to warrant revision of the protocol. Such revisions must be submitted to and have 
documented approval from the s ponsor and IRB /IEC prior to implementation.  The only 
circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated without prior IRB /IEC approval is to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard  to a subject or subjects. In such a case, h owever, the 
investigator must notify the s ponsor immediately and the IRB /IEC within 5 working days after 
implementation.  
11.6 Completion of the Study  
The investigator is required to forward eCRFs and all other relevant data and records to CRO . The 
investigator will complete and report (submission of e CRFs) his/her study in satisfactory 
compliance with the protocol as soon as possible after the completion of the study.  
The investigator must submit a final report to the IRB /IEC and the s ponsor within 1 month of study 
completion or early termination.

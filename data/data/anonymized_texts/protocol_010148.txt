which the treatment might interfere with) the conduct of the clinical trial or interpretation of 
the clinical trial results or that would place  the subject at undue risk by participating in the 
clinical trial. 
CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND DURATION:  
ADX -629-COVID -19-001 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, clinical 
trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PD of ADX -629, administered orally, in adult 
subjects with COVID -19 of moderate severity  prior to the requirement for mechanical ventilation. 
Approximately 30 s ubjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (ADX -629 to placebo)  to receive 
either ADX -629 300 mg bi s in die  or twice daily  (BID) or placebo BID for up to 28 days. 
The reason for hospital admission  (for hospitalized subjects ), the standard of care followed for 
each subject and site, and whether any care decisions were based on resource limitations will be 
clearly documented for all subjects.  
Treatment will begin on Day  1 following randomization. In addition to ADX -629 or placebo, all 
subjects will receive standard of care treatment for COVID -19. Treatment may commence 
whether a subject is hospitalized or is treated as an outpatient at Screening . During the Treatment 
Period (Days  1 to 28/ End of Treatment [ EOT ]), all s ubjects will receive study drug ( either 
ADX -629 or placebo) BID . The study drug will continue to be taken on an outpatient basis if a 
subject is discharged from the hospital prior t o Day  28 for hospitalized  subjects . If a subject is 
placed on mechanical ventilation and/or is otherwise unable to ingest  an oral tablet, dosing will 
be stopped. However, the subject will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety. Dosing of 
the study drug may resume once the subject is able to safely ingest an oral tablet.  
All subjects will also have an assessment using the  NIAID ordinal scale score (see Appendix C ) 
daily  on Days 1 to 28/EOT. The NIAID score will be evaluated directly for inpatient subjects and 
assessed via a subject diary for outpatient subjects  through Day 28.  
After treatment is completed , subjects will undergo a follow -up visit on Day 35 ( ±3 days) and a 
telephone follow -up on Day 60 ( ±3 days). The purpose of the telephone follow -up is to assess 
survival status  and evaluate for COVID -19 relapse.  A telephone follow -up visit may be performed 
in lieu of the Day  35 follow -up visit if the subject is unable to attend in  person.

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD : 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB) with multidisciplinary representation 
will be established to evaluate accumulating clinical trial data and to assess the ongoing safety of 
the clinical trial for the subjects enrolled. Interim safety assessments will be scheduled after the 
first group of 10  subjects has been enrolled and subsequently, as needed, to provide safety 
oversight for subjects in the clinical trial . Additional details will be provided in the DSMB charter.  
STOPPING CRITERIA: 
An independent DSMB will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the first 10  subjects after dosing 
and determine if it is acceptable to continue the clinical trial. Howe ver, safety  and tolerability data 
will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Medical Monitor and stopping rules  will be applicable 
starting with dosing of the first subject .  
Subjects  will be discontinued from dosing, but will continue to be followed in the clinical trial , if

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
ADX-629, a small molecule therapy  formulated for oral administration, is being developed for the 
treatment of chronic diseases with inflammatory and immune -mediated components. The target 
population in this clinical trial is non- ventilated adult subjects with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19) of moderate severity . It is postulated that ADX -629 may mitigate the inflammatory 
response sufficiently in these subjects  to lower levels of inflammatory mediators and potentially 
improve clinical outcome s. 
1.1 Background 
Coronaviruses (CoV)  are common causes of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in a variety 
of animal species, including humans.1 Numerous strains of CoV have been discovered , 7 of which 
have been identified to infect humans. Most of these strains cause mild respiratory  symptoms in 
immunocompetent hosts; however, 3 strains, including the novel severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) -CoV- 2 (SARS -CoV-2), cause severe respiratory syndromes. T he 
SARS -CoV-1, Middle East respiratory s yndrome (MERS) -CoV , and SARS -CoV-2 can all result 
in severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a frequently fatal 
condition.1,2 Although fatality rates from SARS -CoV- 1 and MERS -CoV, 9.5% and 
34.4% respectively2, are higher than r eported rates  for SARS -CoV-2 (ranging from  <1.0% to over 
6% [as of 31 May 2020]3,4), SARS -CoV-2 is more easily transmitted.2  
SARS -CoV-2 originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Secondary  to its high reproductive 
number,2 SARS -CoV-2 quickly spread across China and the world despite attempts at 
quarantining, social distancing, and using personal protective measures. The World Health 
Organization declared the SARS -CoV- 2 and resulting COVID-19 as a pandemic and public health 
emergency of international concern on 30 January  2020.5 As of 31 May  2020, the United States 
has reported 1,737,950 total cases of COVID -19 with 102,785 deaths from the disease.6 
The COVID -19 pandemic has led to an urgent need for new therapies. Many  patients diagnosed 
with COVID -19 will develop ARDS and require ventilatory support. In general, ARDS is 
associated with mortality rates up to 4 0%;7 however,  mortality from COVID -19-induced ARDS  
is even higher, with reported death rates over 50%.8,9,10,11 The worst outcomes are observed in 
older patients and those with chronic diseases.8 A treatment that could prevent the progression to 
severe COVID -19 could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease.

1.1.2 Clinical Trial  of ADX-629 
In addition to nonclinical safety studies, a Phase 1 safety clinical trial was conducted in 85 healthy 
human volunteers in a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial and a multiple ascending dose 
(MAD)  clinical trial. In the SAD clinical trial, 41 subjects received ADX-629 and 13 subjects 
received placebo , across all dose cohorts. In the MAD  clinical  trial, 23 subjects received ADX -629 
and 8 subjects received placebo across all cohorts. Overall, ADX -629 was found to be safe and 
tolerable at the doses expl ored, including the maximum dose of 600 mg bis in die  or twice daily 
(BID). The adverse event  (AE) profile of ADX -629 was favorable compared to placebo. A total 
of 6 (9.4%) subjects who received  ADX- 629 had a treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) compared to 
4 (19.1%) subjects who received placebo. None of the subjects required  an interruption or 
discontinuation of the study drug. 
No clinically meaningful changes were observed in the hepatic and renal analytes, including 
transaminases ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] and aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ]), alkaline 
phosphatase, amylase, gamma -glutamyl transferase , bilirubin, creatinine kinase, and  creatinine. 
No changes in serum glucose were observed. Throughout the clinical trial  period, there were no 
clinically meaningful changes observed in heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic , and 
orthostatic changes), respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, or temperature. No clinically significant hematology changes were observed. ADX -629 did not lead to a prolongation of heart 
rate-corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s formula  (QTcF ). There were no subjects who had a 
QTcF >500 ms or a change of >60 ms from baseline. Five subjects had a change of >30 ms from baseline; however, no intervention or study drug interruption or discontinuation was required, and 
all subjects remained asymptomatic. Three of the 5 subjects were in the SAD portion of the  clinical  
trial (1 each in of the 100 mg, 200 mg, and 700 mg dose cohorts) and the remaining 2 subjects 
were in  the MAD portion of the clinical trial (1 in each of the 150 mg BID and 300 mg BID dose 
cohorts). 
Although PK variability was observed, a linear correlation was evident in C
max and AUC as dose 
increased. The half -life was consistent across cohorts and days, with mean values in multiple day 
exposures ranging from  3.49 hours to 6.83 hours. Little to no accumulation of ADX-629 was 
observed across all cohorts. At the highest dose (600 mg BID), C max was 1700 ng/mL 
(approximately 8.5 µ M) and AUC from time 0 to 12 hours  (AUC 0-12) was 7220 h*ng/mL. At the 
closest dose to the clinical dose (350 mg BID), a C max of 1180 ng/mL (approximately 5.8 µ M) and 
an AUC 0-12 of 4110 h*ng/mL were consistent with an adequate molar ratio to achieve 
stoichiometric efficacy against elevated RASP. A decrease in free MDA levels was observed in 
the plasma of healthy volunteers  over 10 days of oral dosing with ADX -629 600 mg  BID that was 
statistically  significantly  greater than that of subjects treated with placebo. Following ingestion of 
a high- fat meal on Day 10 of dosing with ADX -629 600 mg BID or placebo, levels of free fatty 
acids were statistically significantly lower, and levels of HDL were statistically s ignificantly 
higher, in ADX-629- treated subjects compared with  placebo -treated subjects, potentially 
representing additional anti- inflammatory activity of ADX -629. 
The Investigator’s Brochure provides more details of the clinical trials conducted with ADX-629.

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 1.2 Rationale  
This Phase 2 a, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, clinical trial will assess the safety, 
tolerability,  efficacy,  and pharmacodynamics (PD)  of up to 28 days of treatment with ADX -629 
300 mg BID in subjects with COVID -19 of moderate severity. 
In summary, mechanistic and preclinical data suggest that administration of ADX -629 in 
non-ventilated subject s with COVID- 19 of moderate severity  may mitigate the inflammatory 
response sufficiently to lower levels of inflammatory mediators and potentially improve clinical 
outcome s. Consistent with nonclinical safety results, ADX -629 was deemed to be safe and well 
tolerated in Phase 1 clinical testing, with few and no greater than mild to moderate  TEAEs  at any 
dose tested . 
1.3 Risk/Benefit  
The ADX -629-COVID -19-001 clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PD 
of ADX- 629 in COVID -19-positive subjects with moderate severity  prior to the requirement for  
mechanical ventilation. Scientific data suggest  that a benefit to the subjects may exist from 
participating in th e clinical trial.  
The protocol design, dose selection, and safety monitoring are developed following the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA)  Guidance for Industry for Estimating Maximum Safe Starting Dose 
in Initial Clinical Trials, 2005; the FDA Guidance for Industry for Toxicity Grading Scale for 
Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, 2007;  
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance on first -in-human and early clinical trials 
(EMA,  2017) ; and the Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  
Safety of the clinical dosing regimen in this clinical trial is supported by a P hase 1 clinical trial in 
healthy volunteers and a number of preclinical toxicology and PK studies during which no serious 
safety concerns were noted at the projected therapeutic doses in humans .

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 3 CLINICAL TRIAL  DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Summary of Clinical Trial  Design  
ADX- 629-COVID -19-001 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, clinical 
trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PD of ADX -629, administered orally, in adult 
subjects  with COVID- 19 of moderate severity  prior to the requirement for mechanical ventilation. 
Approximately 30 s ubjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (ADX -629 to placebo) to receive  
either  ADX -629 300 mg BID or placebo BID for up to 28 days. 
The reason for hospital admission (for hospitalized  subjects ), the standard of care  
(see Section  5.6.3)  followed for each subject and site, and whether any care decisions were based 
on resource limitations will be clearly documented for all subjects.  
Treatment will begin on Day  1 following randomization. In addition to ADX -629 or placebo, all 
subjects will receive standard of care treatment for COVID -19. Treatment may commence whether 
a subject is hospitalized or is treated as an outpatient at Screening . During the Treatment Period 
(Days  1 to 28/E nd of Treatment [E OT]), all s ubjects will receive study drug ( either ADX- 629 or 
placebo) BID . The study drug will continue to be taken on an outpatient basis if a subject is 
discharged from the hospital prior to Day 28 for hospitalized subjects . If a subject is placed on 
mechanical ventilation and/or is otherwise unable to ingest  an oral tablet, dosing will be stopped. 
However, the subject will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety. Dosing of the study 
drug may resume once the subject is able to safely ingest an oral tablet.  
All subjects will also have an assessment using the  NIAID  ordinal scale score (see Appendix C ) 
daily  on Days 1 to 28/EOT. The NIAID score will be evaluated directly for inpatient subjects and 
assessed via a subject diary for outpatient subjects  through Day 28.  
After treatment is completed , subjects will undergo a follow -up visit on Day 35 ( ±3 days) and a 
telephone follow -up on Day 60 ( ±3 days). The purpose of the telephone follow -up is to assess 
survival status  and evaluate for COVID -19 relapse. A telephone follow -up visit may be performed 
in lieu of the Day 35 follow -up visit if the subject is unable to attend in  person. 
The clinical trial will be conducted at approximately 3 sites in the United States.  
3.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB) with multidisciplinary representation 
will be established to evaluate accumulating clinical trial data and to assess the ongoing safety of 
the clinical  trial for the subjects enrolled. Interim safety assessments will be scheduled after the 
first group of 10 subjects has been enrolled and subsequently, as needed, to provide safety 
oversight for subjects in the clinical trial. Additional details will be provided in the  DSMB charter . 
3.3 Stopping Criteria  
An independent DSMB will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the first 10 subjects after dosing 
and determine if it is acceptable to continue the clinical trial. However, safety  and tolerability data 
will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Medical Monitor and stopping rules  will be applicable 
starting with dosing of the first subject .

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 14. Is currently on another systemic immunomodulatory therapy (e .g., corticosteroid, calcineurin 
inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine, anti -cytokine therapy, Janus kinase inhibitor) except for daily 
prednisone (or corticosteroid equivalent) ≤ 10 mg/day or inhaled or nasal corticosteroids;  
Note: D examethasone 6 mg daily or equivalent is permitted after randomization at the 
Investigator’s discretion for progression to severe or critical COVID -19 requiring invasive 
ventilation or oxygen therapy for hypoxemia . 
15. Is currently taking duloxetine, bupropion, a statin, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, midazolam,

in the opinion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor, would result in 
either supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic drug levels, placing the subject at undue risk by 
participating in the  clinical trial; 
Note: ADX- 629 may increase the metabolism of other s ensitive  CYP1A2, 2B6, or 
3A4 substrates  (see Appendix D), potentially leading to subtherapeutic  drug levels. Subjects 
taking these medications may be included; however, enrollment  will be decided  upon on an

18. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with (or for 
which the treatment might interfere with) the conduct of the  clinical  trial or interpretation of 
the clinical trial results or that would place the subject at undue risk by participating in the 
clinical trial.  
4.3 Withdrawal Criteria  
Participation of a subject in this clinical trial may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of  consent or a subject request  for discontinuation from the clinical trial for any 
reason ; 
• Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to t he requirements of the protocol ; 
• Any SAE, clinically significant AE , severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, or 
other medical condition which indicates to the Investigator that continued participation is not 
in the best interest of the subject ; 
• Pregnancy ; 
• Requirement of pr ohibited concomitant medication ; 
• Subject failure to comply with protocol requirements or clinical trial- related procedures ; or 
• Termination of the clinical trial by the Sponsor or the regulatory authority. 
Unless a subject withdraws consent for further follow -up, subjects who discontinue study drug 
(ADX- 629 or placebo) will continue with the clinical trial for acquisition of safety and efficacy 
assessments through the Day 60 telephone follow -up visit. If a subject  withdraws prematurely from

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 5 CLINICAL TRIAL  TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment Groups  
All subjects will receive either ADX -629 300 mg BID or placebo BID for up to 28 days. The study 
drug will be administered orally  as a tablet , at the discretion of the Investigator. 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
The starting dose for ADX -629 is based on the nonclinical studies conducted to- date and the doses 
used in the P hase 1 healthy volunteer clinical trial. Subjects in this clinical trial received escalating 
single and multiple doses , and the highest strength tested was 600 mg BID for a period of 10 days. 
 
 
  
  
  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive an oral tablet of either ADX-629 300 mg BID 
or placebo BID for up to 28 days. Subjects, Investigators, and clinical trial personnel (including 
the Sponsor/designee)  involved in the administration and assessment of the study drug will be 
blinded to the subject treatment assignments throughout the clinical trial.  
5.4 Breaking the Blind  
The Investigator is responsible for the medical care of subjects during the clinical trial. In an 
emergency, when knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of the subject, the Investigator can unblind the treatment assignment. It is encouraged that the Investigator contact the Medical Monitor (or designee) before proceeding with the unblinding process. Unblinding should only occur for the subject in question if it is critical for treatment decision making by the Investigator for the well-being of the subject. 
Prior to unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment, the Investigator should assess the 
relationship of an AE to study drug (yes or no). If unblinding is warranted, the Investigator must then follow the appropriate procedures to unblind an individual subject’s treatment assignment.  
Generally, the blind should only be broken for events that are considered to be serious, unexpected, 
and causally related to the clinical trial treatments, or as requested by local regulatory authorities.  
If the clinical trial blind is broken, the Investigator must detail the date and reason for unblinding 
in the subject’s records. The Investigator must also notify the Sponsor (and Institutional Review 
Board [ IRB] if applicable), if this has not already been done, that the clinical trial blind has been 
broken. If the blind is broken due to an AE, the AE form must be completed and reported to the 
Sponsor (see Section  8.6).

dispensed, administered, and returned.  
5.5.5 Storage and Accountability 
The pharmacist  (or designee)  will acknowledge receipt of all shipments of the study drug and 
maintain an inventory. The study drugs must be kept in a locked area with restricted access and 
stored and handled in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The pharmacist  (or 
designee)  will also keep accurate records of the quantities of the study drugs dispensed and used 
by each subjec t. The clinical research associate (CRA) will periodically check the supplies of study 
drugs held by the pharmacist to verify accountability of all study drugs used. 
At the conclusion of the  clinical trial, all unused study drugs will be returned to the Sponsor unless 
other arrangements have been approved by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will verify that a final report 
of drug accountability to the unit dose level is prepared and maintained in the Investigator clinical trial file.

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 6.3 Treatment Period – Days  1 Through 28/E OT 
During the Treatment Period, all subjects will receive study drug ( either ADX- 629 or placebo) 
BID on Days  1 to 28/E OT. Treatment may commence whether a subject is hospitalized or is treated 
as an outpatient at Screening . The study drug will continue to be taken on an outpatient basis  if a 
subject is discharged from the hospital prior to Day 28 for hospitalized subjects . The study drugs  
will each be administered orally  BID, at the discretion of the Investigator, without food, defined 
as no food for at least 2 hours prior to dosing and at least  1 hour  after dosing. Inpatient subjects 
will receive the study drug in the hospit al. Outpatient subjects will take the study drug at home 
according to their usual schedule, including on Days 1, 7, 13, 22, and 28. 
All s ubjects will also have an assessment using the  NIAID  ordinal scale score ( see Appendix C ) 
daily  on Days 1 to 28/EOT. The NIAID score will be evaluated directly for inpatient subjects and 
assessed via a subject diary for outpatient subjects  through Day 28. For outpatient subjects, the 
subject will receive instructions for subject diary completion on Day 1, while inpatient subjects 
will receive instructions on the day of discharge. Site personnel will monitor subject compliance 
between onsite study visits and contact subjects who  are not compliant with diary completion. 
Subject compliance (for outpatient subjects only)  for the subject  diaries should be reviewed at the 
onsite visits at Days 7, 13, 22, and 28. 
Inpatient subjects will have an assessment of standard of care (see Section  5.6.3)  daily on Days 1 
to 28/EOT  (or until discharge) . Outpatient subjects will have an assessment of standard of care 
(see Section 5.6.3) at each visit through Day 28.  
In addition to study drug administration and NIAID score assessment , the procedures  listed below  
will be performed on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28/E OT (inpatients). Subjects who 
commence treatment as outpatients or who are discharged from the hospital prior to Day 28 will 
undergo a telephone visit on Day 4 to assess safety and weekly onsite visits  through Day 28  (on 
Days  7, 13, 22, and 28) , which will include  vital sign assessments, physical examinations, and 
local laboratory evaluations , as indicated below.

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
The safety of ADX -629 will be determined by evaluation of the following:  
• AEs;  
• Safety laboratory tests (including chemistry, hematology, coagulation parameters,  and 
urinalysis) ;  
• Vital signs (including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen

• 12-lead ECG s. 
8.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal pro duct. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF . 
AEs, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the 
time of informed consent until the last clinical trial visit, including the telephone follow -up. 
Subjects should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigator , whether or 
not they think the event is due to clinical trial treatment.  Beginning at Screening, Investigators 
should make an assessment for AEs  at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE  eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator  and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator , it should be recorded as a separate AE  on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be recorded a s an AE, not the procedure  itself .  
Any medical condition already present at S creening  should be recorded as medical history and 
should not be reported as an AE  unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at 
baseline changes in severity , frequency, or seriousness at any time during the clinical trial. In this 
case, it should be reported as an A E. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g., ECG ) findings that are 
detected during the clinical trial or are present at  Screening  and significantly worsen during the 
clinical trial should be reported as AEs , as described below . The Investigator  will exercise his or 
her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical trial will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are determined to be an error should 
not be report ed as an AE . Laboratory test results  that are abnormal, but not clinically significant 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -629-COVID- 19-001 
Confidential & Proprietary  Page 43 of 67 
Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 as determined by the Investigator, should not be reported as  an AE. Laboratory abnormalities or 
other abnormal clinical findings (e .g., ECG  abnormalities) should be reported as an AE  if any of 
the following are applicable:  
• If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality;  
• If action taken with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality; or  
• Based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator . 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility  (i.e., the 
relationship cannot be ruled out ). 
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information.  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
The Investigator  will assess the severity (intensity) of each AE  using the CTCAE version 5.0 and 
will also categorize each AE  as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of 
“no” or “yes.”  
Severity assessment  
The severity of all AEs  should be graded according to the CTCAE version 5.0. For those AE  terms  
not listed in the CTCAE, the following grading system should be used:  
• CTCAE Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated;  
• CTCAE Grade 2: Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ; 
• CTCAE Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living ; 
• CTCAE Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; and  
• CTCAE Grade 5:  Death related to the AE . 
Causality a ssessment  
The relationship of an AE  to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions:  
• No (unrelated, not related, or unlikely to be relate d) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE  rules out a causal 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -629-COVID- 19-001 
Confidential & Proprietary  Page 44 of 67 
Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 relationship and another cause ( e.g., concomitant drugs, therapies, complication) is suspected; 
or 
• Yes ( possibly related, probably related , or definitely related ) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE  is consistent with a 
causal relationship and no other cause ( e.g., concomitant drugs, therapies, complications) can 
be identified. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between 
the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest 
a causal relationship.  
The following factors should also be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the 
study drug:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration;  
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases ; 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant drugs;  
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug;  
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a 
class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses ; and  
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and 
better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and PK  of the study drug.  
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered.  
8.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death ; 
• A life -threatening AE ; 
Note: An AE  or adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk  of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -629-COVID- 19-001 
Confidential & Proprietary  Page 45 of 67 
Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 • Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations; 
Note : Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency room or urgent care visit without hospital admission will not 
be recorded as a SAE  under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent , or elective treatment of a pre -existing condition 
that did not worsen from baseline. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as AEs and assessed for 
seriousness.  Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons ( i.e., no place to stay, 
live too far away to come for hospital visits , respite care) will not be considered inpatient 
hospitalizations.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
• An important medical event.  
Note : Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependen cy. 
Note: Events related to  progression of the subjec t’s underlying COVID -19 diagnosis will be 
captured as endpoints; therefore, events clearly related to progression of the subject ’s underlying 
COVID- 19 (signs  or symptoms of progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless 
considered related to study drug or if the outcome is fatal  during the  clinical  trial or within the 
safety reporting period. If the event has a fatal outcome during that timeframe, the event of “Progression of COVID-19” must be recorded as an SAE with a fatal outcome . 
8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators  
Initial reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent  must be reported to Clinical 
Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence . After the 30 -day reporting window, 
any SAE  that the Investigator considers related to the study drug must be reported to the  
Clinical Safety or the Sponsor/designee. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the  clinical  trial. When the form is completed, Safety personnel will be 
notified electronically  by the EDC system  and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious 
criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system ,  
 
 
within 24 hours of awareness. When the EDC system becomes 
available, the SAE information must be entered within 24 hours of the system becoming available .

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 Follow-up r eports  
The Investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) , or the subject 
dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the clinical trial and submit any supporting documentation 
(e.g., subject discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Clinical Safety via fax or email. 
If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs. 
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the clinical trial or within the safety follow -up period defined 
in the protocol, the Investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) immediately and the subject 
should be withdrawn from the  clinical  trial. Early termination procedures should be implemented 
at that time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE  or SAE; however, it must be reported to  
Clinical Safety within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  Clinical Safety will then 
provide the Investigator/site the Exposure In Utero  (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to  Clinical Safety.  
If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while the subject is receiving study drug or within the safety follow -up period defined in the protocol, the Investigator should notify 
 Clinical Safety as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy, whenever possible. Once the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be complete d and faxed/emailed to 
 Clinical Safety. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (i .e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.5 Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant information about Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions  (SUSAR s) that are fatal or life -threatening as soon as possible to the FDA, but 
no later than 7 days after knowledge by the Sponsor/designee of such a case. Relevant  follow-up 
information will subsequently be communicated within an additional 8 days.  
All other SUSARs  will be reported to the FDA  as soon as possible but within a maximum of 
15 days of first knowledge by the Sponsor/designee.  The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country- specific legislation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inform  all Investigators as required per local regulations. 
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to investigational medicinal product.

8.7 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
All standard blood tests will be analyzed by the local laboratory. Blood samples will be collected 
and processed per institutional requirements and local processes.  
Clinical laboratory tests are to be performed only if not done routinely as standard of care and only 
to the extent that the tests are missing to meet the clinical trial requirements. The Investigator will 
review laboratory values for those outside of the normal range and will be required to conduct clinically appropriate follow -up procedures. Clinical significance of the values outside of normal 
ranges will be assessed by the Investigator.  
Clinical laboratory tests, including chemistry, hematology, coagulation parameters, and urinalyses , 
will be measured according to the timing specified in the Schedule of Procedures  (Appendix A ). 
For specifics of the analytes measured, see Appendix B .  
8.8 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Vital signs will be collected BID, both times prior to dosing with ADX -629. On Day 1, 
vital signs will also be collected at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post the morning dose. 
8.9 Physical Examinations 
A full physical examination will be performed only at S creening. Full physical examination will 
include the following systems: dermatological, head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, respiratory, 
cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, abdominal, and general appearance.  
A targeted physical examination, driven by the subject’s signs and symptoms, will be performed 
at the remaining visits, as specified in the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix A ).  
8.10 Electrocardiograms  
Twelve- lead ECGs will be performed  at Screening or Day  1 (pre-dose ), on Day 1 at  1 hour and 
6 hours post -dose , and on Day 7. Whenever ECG s and blood samples are specified to be collected 
at the same time, ECG s will be obtained before the blood samples. ECGs should be obtained in 
digital format when possible and archived.  
Subjects  should be in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to the ECG measurement. The 
ECG measurements will include heart rate, RR -interval, PR-interval, QT- interval, QRS -complex, 
and QTcF.  
8.11 SARS -CoV-2 Testing  
SARS -CoV-2 testing may be performed at Screening  if needed. The subject must have a 
documented, laboratory- confirmed SARS -CoV- 2 infection , as determined by PCR  or another 

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -629-COVID- 19-001

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 commercial or public health assay , and a confirmatory test for SARS -CoV -2 within 3 days 
(72 hours)  of randomization to be included in the clinical trial. A verbal report of infection will 
not suffice. This  will be performed at Screening  only if a documented result is unavailable . 
8.12 Other Safety Assessment  
A chest X -ray will be collected at Screening. Subjects will be excluded from the clinical  trial if 
there are significant infiltrates on chest X -ray (e.g., involving > 50% of lung fields) at Screening  as 
determined by the Investigator .

9.1 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are defined for this clinical trial:  
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects;  
• Safety Population: All randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug;  
• Per-Protocol Population: All subjects in the ITT Population without major protocol deviations ; 
and 
• PD Population: All subjects who have  at least 1 PD measurement . 
9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1 Analysis of Endpoints  
Clinical parameters will be assessed via linear models with repeated measures  over 28 days . 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed using other techniques. The specific statistical analysis 
methods are detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
9.2.2 Analysis of Safety  
AEs will be classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
and will be presented by counting the number of subjects reporting each event by treatment. The 
number (percentage) of subjects reporting TEAEs and SAEs for each preferred term will be 
tabulated by s ystem organ class (SOC), by SOC and severity, and by SOC and relationship to the 
study drug. If more than 1 event occurs with the same preferred term for the same subject, the 
subject will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe or related 
occurrence for the summary by severity or relationship to study drug, respectively.  
If specific AEs occur in a sufficient number of subjects, an exposure -response model may be 
developed as a secondary analysis.  
Clinical laboratory values (excluding efficacy laboratory parameters) will be summarized by 
treatment arm, including changes from baseline at each visit.  
Vital signs and change from baseline in vital signs will be summarized descriptively at each visit 
by treatment arm.  
9.2.3 Interi m Analysis  
An independent DSMB with multidisciplinary representation will be established to evaluate 
accumulating clinical trial data and to assess the ongoing safety of the  clinical  trial for the subjects 
enrolled. Interim safety assessments will be scheduled after the first group of 10 subjects has been 
enrolled and subsequently, as needed, to provide safety oversight for subjects in the clinical trial. 
Additional details will be provided in the DSMB charter.

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 11 INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS AND QUALITY CONTROL  
11.1 Ethical Conduct of the Clinical Trial  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording, and reporting clinical trials  that involve human subjects. 
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of 
clinical trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible.  
11.2 Institutional Review Board  
The IRB will review all appropriate clinical trial documentation in order to safeguard the rights, 
safety, and well -being of subject s. The clinical trial will only be conducted at sites where IRB 
approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, ICF, advertisements (if 
applicable), written information given to the subject s, safety updates, annual progress reports, and 
any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by the Investigator. 
Federal regulations and International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines require that 
approval be obtained from an IRB prior to participation of subject s in clinical  trials . Prior to clinical 
trial onset, the protocol, any protocol amendments, ICF s, advertisements to be used for subject  
recruitment, and any other written information regarding this clinical trial to be provided to a 
subject  or subject ’s legal guardian must be approved by the IRB. 
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB authorization has been received 
by the Sponsor. 
11.3 Informed Consent  
A written (or electronic) ICF, or equivalent consent per FDA guidelines on COVID -19 clinical 
trials, must be obtained from the subject, or a legally authorized representative, prior to performing 
any protocol -specific procedure.  
The ICF  and any changes to the ICF  made during the course of the  clinical  trial must be agreed to 
by the Sponsor  or designee and the IRB prior to its use and must be in compliance with all ICH 
GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. 
The Investigator  must ensure that each clinical trial  subject is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the clinical trial and possible risks associated with participation and must ensure that 
the subject has been informed of his/her rights to privacy. The Investigator  will obtain written  (or 
electronic) informed consent from each subject  or legally authorized representative  before any 
protocol -specific procedure is performed and should document in the source documentation that 
consent was obtained prior to enrollment in the clinical trial. The original signed copy of the ICF  
must be maintained by the Investigator  and is subject to inspection by a representative of the 
Sponsor , their representatives, auditors, the IRB and/or regulatory agencies. A copy of the signed 
ICF will be given to the  subject.  
11.4 Clinical Trial  Monitoring Requirements  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the clinical trial is conducted in accordance 
with the protocol, Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements , and 
that valid data are entered into the eCRFs.  
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -629-COVID- 19-001 
Confidential & Proprietary  Page 54 of 67 
Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor  in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized and easily retrievable data. Before 
the enrollment of any subject in this clinical trial, the Sponsor  or their designee will review with 
the Investigator  and site personnel the following documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, 
eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed consent process, and the procedure for 
reporting SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor  or their designee to monitor the clinical trial as frequently 
as deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. 
During the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents , and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data are  
entered by the site, the CRA will review the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, 
and logical consistency. Com puter programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical trial . If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and 
provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by signature and date on the clinical trial-specific monitoring 
log. 
11.5 Disclosure of Data  
Data generated by this clinical trial must be available for inspection by the FDA, the Sponsor or 
their designee, applicable foreign health authorities, and the IRB as appropriate. Subjects or their 
legal representatives may request t hat t heir medical information be given to their personal 
physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for their welfare.  
Subject medical information obtained during the clinical trial is confidential, and disclosure to 
third parties other than those noted above is prohibited. 
11.6 Retention of Records  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor , the I nvestigator 
will keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link 
records, [e.g., eCRFs and hospital records ]), all original signed ICFs , copies of all e CRFs, SAE 
forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records should be 
retained by the Investigator  according to specifications in the ICH guidelines, local regulations, or 
as specified in the Clinical Trial  Agreement, whichever is longer. The Investigator  must obtain 
written permission from the Sponsor  before disposing of any records, even if retention 
requirements have been met.  
If the Investigator  relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the clinical trial, the Sponsor  
should be prospectively notified. The clinical trial records must be transferred to an acceptable 
designee, such as another Investigator , another institution, or to the Sponsor .  
11.7 Publication Policy  
Following completion of the clinical trial, the data may be considered for publication in a scientific 
journal or for reporting at a scientific meeting. Each Investigator  is obligated to keep data 
pertaining to the clinical trial confidential. The Investigator  must consult with the Sponsor  before 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.

Note: Strong, moderate, and weak inhibitors are drugs that increase the AUC of sensitive index substrates of a given metaboli c 
pathway ≥5-fold, ≥2 to <5-fold, and ≥ 1.25 to <2-fold, respectively. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A causing ≥ 10-fold increase in 
AUC of sensitive index substrate(s) are shown above the line.  
Note:  This table is prepared to provide examples of clinical inhibitors and is not intended to be an exhaustive list.  
Note: This table has been modified from the original source for relevancy to this study.  
AUC  = area under the concentration -time curve; CYP  = cytochrome P450; DDI  = drug- drug interaction; HIV  = human 
immunodeficiency virus; HCV  = hepatitis C virus; P -gp = P-glycoprotein.

Version 3.0, 11 December  2020  APPENDIX E: FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION EXAMPLES  OF 
BASELINE SEVERITY CATEGORIZATION  
SARS -CoV -2 infection without symptoms  
• Positive testing by standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) assay 
or equivalent test ; and  
• No symptoms . 
Mild COVID- 19 
• Positive testing by standard RT -PCR assay or equivalent test ;  
• Symptoms of mild illness with COVID -19 that could include fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, 
headache, muscle pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms, without shortness of breath or dyspnea ; 
and 
• No clinical signs indicative of Moderate, Severe, or Critical severity.  
Moderate COVID -19 
• Positive testing by standard RT -PCR assay or equivalent test ; 
• Symptoms of moderate illness with COVID -19, which could include any symptom of mild 
illness or shortness of breath with exertion;  
• Clinical signs suggestive of moderate illness with COVID -19, such as respiratory rate 
≥20 breaths per minute, saturation of oxygen > 93% on room air at sea level, or heart rate 
≥90 beats per minute ; and  
• No clinical signs indicative of S evere or C ritical s everity . 
Severe COVID -19 
• Positive testing by standard RT -PCR assay or equivalent test ; 
• Symptoms suggestive of severe systemic illness with COVID- 19, which could include any 
symptom of moderate illness or shortness of breath at rest, or respiratory distress;  
• Symptoms suggestive of severe systemic illness with COVID -19, such as respiratory rate 
≥30 breaths per minute, saturation of oxygen ≤93% on room air at sea level, heart rate 
≥125 beats per minute, or partial pressure of oxygen/ fraction of inspired oxygen < 300; and  
• No criteria for C ritical s everity .

Version 3.0, 11 December  2020  Critical COVID -19 
• Positive testing by standard RT -PCR assay or equivalent test ; and  
• Evidence of critical illness, defined by at least 1 of the following:  
o Respiratory failure defined based on resource utilization requiring at least 1 of the 
following:  
 Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, oxygen delivered by high- flow 
nasal cannula (heated, humidified, oxygen delivered via reinforced nasal cannula at 
flow rates >20 L/minute with fraction of delivered oxygen ≥ 0.5), noninvasive positive 
pressure ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or clinical diagnosis of 
respiratory failure (i.e., clinical need for 1 of the preceding therapies, but preceding 
therapies are not able to be administered in setting of resource limitation) ; 
o Shock (defined by systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg , 
or requiring vasopressors) ; or 
o Multi- organ dysfunction/failure .  
Note: A clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure (in the setting of resource limitation) in which the 
management deviates from standard of care should be recorded as part of formal data collection.

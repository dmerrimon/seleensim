Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  1  
  
 
1.0 Purpose  
 
We have demonstrated that administration of HER -2/neu pulsed DC1 in patients with DCIS and 
early invasive breast cancer  (IBC) results in strong immunologic responses as well as apparent 
clinical responses during 4 and 6 week neoadjuvant vaccination. Patients with locally advanced 
breast cancer that have significant nodal disease have significant risk of systemic recurrence . In 
addition, those patients with recurrence after chemotherapy and trastuzumab have significant risk 
of additional local or systemic recurrence and may be resistant to trastuzumab. Those patients 
with HER -2 2+ that are FISH negative that are often ER pos itive with significant nodal disease 
are also at high risk for recurrence despite chemotherapy and anti -estrogen therapy. These 
patients are not classically treated with trastuzumab but may still respond to HER -2 directed 
therapy but also have diminished i mmunity to HER -2. All these patients have little additional 
therapy options. We hypothesize that adding DC1 vaccines pulsed with HER -2, will reduce the 
risk of recurrence and diminish deaths in these high risk patients. The primary goals of this trial 
will be to determine the safety and immune activity of HER -2 pulsed DC1 vaccine in patients  
with high risk HER -2pos breast cancer with significant risk of systemic recurrence. We will also 
explore the possibility of determining whether circulating tumor cells can be used as surrogate to 
assess response to vaccination.  
 
2.0 Duration of Study  
 
This study will enroll 18 evaluable subjects over 1.5 years averaging 10 subjects per year. 
Evaluable implies that a patient received all 6 vaccinations and underwent leuka pheresis after the 
vaccinations for immune response evaluation.  
 
Fifteen subjects were enrolled at the Rowan Breast Center. Approximately 4 subjects will receive 
their treatment at follow up at Moffitt Cancer Center while remaining subjects will continue to be 
followed at Rowan Breast Center.  
 
 
3.0 Subject Recruitment  
 
Women with advanced breast cancer with ≥ 4 or more positive nodes with classic HER -2pos or 
HER-2 2+ FISH negative, or those with local or systemic recurrence that are rendered NED by 
any means will be recruited from the clinical practices of the Rena Rowa n Breast Center at the 
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Breast Center Moffitt Cancer Center.  
 
 
4.0 Location of the Trial  
 
The subjects will be recruited and followed in the Rowan Breast Center and the Moffitt Cancer 
Center. Mammograms wil l be performed at either site.  Leukapheresis will be performed in the 
Apheresis Infusion Blood Donation Center on the 3rd Floor of Ravdin  and at Moffitt Cancer 
Center.  Elutriation will be performed in the FDA approved facility in the Blood Bank on 3 
Ravdin and at Moffitt Cancer Center .  The vaccines will either be prepared in the FDA approved 
facility, under the direction of , at the Abramson Family Cancer Research 
Institute on 6 Maloney, or the Vaccine Production Facility in the M2GEN building on the 
McKinley campus at Moffitt Cancer Center under the direction of  Vaccinations

5.0 Background  
 
5.1 The Problem 
 
Most breast cancer patients, especially those with high -risk HER -2 positive or triple negative breast 
cancers, live with significant fear of recurrence -even when initial therapy appears  successful.  
Patients with positive lymph nodes or patients with locally advanced HER -2 positive or triple 
negative cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy that have residual disease found at surgery, both 
have significant risk of systemic recurrence5. Tragically, there is  little to offer these patients in the 
way of recurrence risk reduction that does not come with significant toxicity or other deleterious  side- 
effects. Even those patients with intermediate expression of HER -2 (2+) are at significant risk for late 
recurrence6. In addition, solid evidence now suggests HER -2 expressing stem cells and disseminated 
tumor cells can be found in the marrow and metastatic deposits in patients whose primary tumor does 
not express significant HER -27. Even amongst HER -2 negative pati ents EGFR (HER -1) or HER -3 
pathways are active and phosphorylated HER -2 proteins are identified8. These numerous patient 
populations are therefore in great need of new therapies to prevent outgrowth of distant disease, 
provided physicians and scientists ca n develop technologies to eliminate these remaining dormant 
cancer stem cells that will ultimately reactivate, leading to significant mortality.  
 
Role of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases in Breast Development and Tumorigenesis  
To explain why these molecules are i mportant in breast cancer development is to understand their  
role in normal breast development. These RTK molecules are critically involved in multiple levels of 
breast development 9. HER-1 and HER -2 are expressed in early breast bud development especiall y 
Her-1 (EGFR) which is required for duct elongation at puberty. HER -2 and HER -3 play particularly 
important roles in duct elongation and branching during pregnancy and invasion of mammary pads. 
Hence they are critically involved in normal breast developme nt and lactation. Mutation or assault 
from carcinogens may cause these molecules to at later time become over -expressed or aberrantly 
expressed in breast tumor tissue. The expression of these molecules could be a particularly critical 
site for interactions  with viruses, other pathogens, and chronic inflammation causing damage or 
mutation and over - expression of the HER members. There are examples of identified mutations in 
HER-1, HER-2 and HER -3 in all phenotypes of breast cancer 10, 11. 
 
Several murine models have been identified where over -expression of HER family members leads to 
invasive breast cancer development in mature mice12. Over-expression of these molecules appears to 
be sufficient to cause breast cancer development. Evidence is fairly abundan t in human tissues that 
these molecules are expressed in early human breast cancers. We have demonstrated that HER -2 
expression in DCIS is associated with finding invasive disease suggesting HER -2 may be progression 
factor 13, 14. HER-3 is also expressed i n DCIS and we have found that its expression increases with 
grade of DCIS. HER -1 is least expressed in early breast cancer except in triple negative DCIS and 
few other instances. HER -1 is expressed in about 30% of the DCIS lesions in BRCA1 mutation 
carriers going along with its expression in triple negative breast cancer. Taken together these HER 
family members seem to play an important  role in normal breast development  and when mutated or 
over-expressed play a dominant role in early breast cancer developme nt. 
 
Immune Response Impacts Breast Cancer  
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  4  
  
 
Evidence has demonstrated that infiltration of breast tumors with CD8 T cells results in prolonged 
survival15. There is also evidence that accumulation of CD4 and CD8 T cells in regional nodes is 
associated with better outcomes as well16. Counteracting this there is an accumulation of 
macrophages, immature myeloid suppressor cells and regulatory T cells that inhibit the immune 
response and promote growth and invasion of tumor cells 17, 18. Chemother apies such as 
cyclophosphamide and docetaxol may eliminate some of the inhibitory cells enhancing immune 
responses19. There is evidence that combinations of chemotherapy and immune therapies with 
antibodies may increase responses such as seen with trastuzu mab20. Adding immune therapies 
especially through vaccines with chemotherapy may enhance the immune response as the inhibitory 
cells are diminished thus filling the immune space with tumor specific lymphocytes. We will take 
advantage of chemotherapy to ope n space in the immune repertoire and vaccinating to add specific 
anti-HER T cells to eliminate residual microscopic tumor deposits.  
 
5.2 The Solution 
 
The HER family of RTK provide critical signaling for development of breast cancer. HER -1 (EGFR) 
HER-2 and HER -3 have all been shown critical in normal breast development as well as breast 
tumorigenesis and invasion 8. These molecules are over -expressed or mutated in a significant fraction 
of early and late breast cancer lesions 13, 21. These are particularly dominant in HER - 2 and triple 
negative breast cancers 22.There is evidence that therapeutic antibodies like trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab, combined with c hemotherapy, can have dramatic impacts in eliminating these primary 
tumors 23. However, there is also evidence of the molecules being involved in resistance to  treatments  
24. Patients with locally advanced HER -2/neu and triple -negative cancers are at sign ificant risk of 
systemic recurrence, especially when complete pathologic response is not obtained with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. We believe that targeting these pathways with a cellular immune response  
(particularly CD4 T cells) may prevent or eliminate d ormant tumor cells remaining after therapy. Our 
preliminary data outlined below highlights an opportunity to potentially increase complete responses 
and help prevent recurrence in these patients with significant risk of systemic failure following 
standard therapy. Dendritic cell cancer vaccines combined with chemotherapy may increase complete 
responses giving breast cancer specific immune cells greater opportunity to function while the  
immune  repertoire  is  being  shifted  by chemotherapy to  anti -breast  cancer  response  and  offer  the 
chance to test secondary prevention of breast cancer in high risk settings. There is a need to determine 
whether this ICAIT DC1 can activate CD4 and CD8 T cells prior to or in combination with 
chemotherapy with or without  added trastuzumab. This would be a tremendous opportunity to  
improve outcomes for these high risk  patients. 
 
5.3 Preliminary  Data 
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  5  
 
 
 
Experience with the vaccine to prevent recurrence: DC1 induces durable Th1 -polarized anti - 
HER-2 responses with  apparent clinical activity. A large body of novel and well -founded 
preclinical and clinical data justifies and supports our expandable platform for breast cancer 
prevention. We have completed a phase -I clinical trial with 27 subjects to vaccinate against HER- 
2/neu over -expressing early breast cancer (Ductal carcinoma in situ -DCIS) or DCIS with 
microinvasion3,4, and  are currently undertaking  a  second  phase  I/II study to  extend  these findings.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects diagnosed with HER -2/neupos DCIS were vaccinated four times at weekly intervals prior to 
scheduled surgical resection of the tumor. The vaccines consisted of HER -2 peptide -pulsed  
autologous DC specially activated with IFN -γ and a clinical -grade toll -like receptor agonist (LPS), 
resulting in high-level IL-12 and Th1 chemokine secretion ( DC1). The peptides used to pulse ICAIT 
DC consisted of 6 HLA class II promiscuous binders, as well as two HLA class I binding peptides (for 
HLA-A2.1pos subjects). A summary of trial results is shown in the  composite Figure 1 A -G. Briefly, 
Immunohistochemical staining and comparison of pre -vaccine biopsy with post -vaccine surgical 
specimen showed that vaccination induced heavy influx of CD4pos helper-T cells around DCIS (Fig. 
1A), as well as CD8pos CTL and C D20 B cell (not shown). Immunohistochemical staining of HER - 
2/neu expression by DCIS in the pre -vaccine biopsy (“PRE”) compared with the post -vaccine surgical 
specimen (“POST”) indicated marked reduction of HER -2 expression in half of the subjects (Fig. 1 B). 
The left panels of “B” show photo microscopy of stained DCIS sections from one representative 
subject (note loss of brown HER -2 staining in “POST” specimen) while the right panels show 
composite data of HER -2 reductions from 8 sample subjects as well a s unvaccinated controls. No  such 
reductions were observed in an unvaccinated contemporaneous control group (Fig. 1B) suggesting  
that vaccination could eliminate HER -2-overexpressing tumor cells. A comparison of estimated tumor 
size determined radiographic ally prior to vaccination with the actual tumor removed during surgery 
indicated reductions in the area of disease for about half of the subjects, with results for five of these 
clinically-responsive individuals shown (Fig. 1C). In fact, five of 27 subject s had no detectable DCIS 
at  the time  of surgery,  suggesting vaccine -induced elimination of  DCIS  for some  cases.  For  HLA- 
A2.1pos subjects, we routinely demonstrated the capacity of post -vaccination CD8pos T cells to directly 
recognize and secrete IF N-γ in response to HER -2pos breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Results from a 
representative subject are shown (Fig.1D). This is important since CD4pos and CD8pos T  cell  
infiltration in IBC is associated with long -term survival.  The immunity generated by this   vaccination  
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  6  
  
 
regimen proved to be extremely long -lived. Seventeen of twenty -seven subjects voluntarily provided 
additional blood samples 8 -48 months post -vaccination. All subjects showed long -term CD4 T cell 
immunity to vaccine pep tides by ELISpot. Anti -peptide results for subjects 1, 2 and 6 (taken 48, 48 
and 43 month’s post -vaccination, respectively) without prior stimulation are shown (Fig. 1E). Note 
that the long -term recall responses to vaccine peptides are often superior in ma gnitude to the recall 
response against tetanus toxoid. Despite the fact that this vaccine regimen was not optimized for 
antibody induction, we nonetheless demonstrated in some patients’ sera a vaccine -induced increase in 
complement -dependent lysis of HER -2/neupos tumor lines in vitro (Fig. 1F), a property not seen with 
trastuzumab. Although antibody titers appeared fairly low (not shown), these data provide strong 
encouragement that antibody responses are present and ripe for dramatic improvement. Of utmost  
importance in this completed trial and a second follow -on trial now in progress is that we have a 
composite complete pathologic response rate of about 35% in ERneg HER-2pos (i.e. hormone - 
independent) DCIS patients compared with 4% for ERpos HER-2neg (Fig. 1G). Since pathologic CR in 
breast cancer is associated with decreased risk of recurrence and deaths, it is not surprising that we 
have observed no breast cancer events in the patients that are ERneg HER-2pos compared to the group 
that is ERpos HER-2pos (Fig. 1G) we are highly confident that this Th1 -polarizing DC vaccine will be 
associated with diminished secondary recurrence of DCIS and IBC. We wish to determine whether 
these vaccines following chemotherapy can induce immune responses and ultimately d ecrease 
recurrence in high risk node positive patients.  
 
Clinical experience with DC1 vaccines : The vaccines are readily produced from all 80 subjects thus 
treated with early breast cancer. There is abundant IL -12 production. There is 85 -90% induction of 
CD4 and CD8 T cells that recognize HER -2 post vaccination. None of these patients had immediately 
had chemotherapy or trastuzumab. The side effects of vaccine included grade 1 and 2 fevers, chills, 
fatigue, injection site soreness, headache. There were <10%  of patients with asymptomatic declines in 
MUGA scan all within normal range above 50%. There was no one that developed heart failure 
clinically or by cardiac ejection. Any grade 1 or 2 changes in cardiac ejection fraction were reverted to 
baseline in repe at scan 30 days later. Thus the vaccines were considered safe and well tolerated.  
 
Evidence for CD4 T cells that recognize extracellular domain HER -1 and HER -3 in early breast 
cancer: The majority of DCIS patients even prior to vaccination have evidence of  CD4 T cells that 
secrete INF -γ when stimulated with extracellular domain (ECD) HER -1 (Fig 2 left graph). Those 
patients that do not have anti -HER-1 response developed a response to HER -1 following vaccination 
against HER -2 (Fig 2 right graph). There were only a few patients with evidence of HER -3 CD4 T  
cell responses prior to vaccination but the majority developed suggestion of weak CD4 T cell 
responses beginning after vaccination (Fig 3). These data support that following HER -2 vaccination 
using DC1 ther e is evidence that immune responses against HER -1 and HER -3 can be generated and 
are ripe for the improvements proposed in this  application.

protocol to confirm diagnosis of IBC. The Hercept (Dako) antibody will be used to analyze the 
expression of HER -2/neu on the IBC. Conventional HER -2 3+ 10% of the cells will b e 
considered classic HER -2 positive or 2+ with FISH amplification 2 fold increase in FISH 
amplicons. For HER -2 2+ FISH negative, ten percent of the cells staining at least 2+ will be 
considered positive for HER -2/neu expression . 
 
 
6.1 Preparation of the  vaccine 
 
Preparation of the vaccine is a multi -step process starting with leukapheresis and countercurrent 
centrifugal elutriation to obtain the relevant monocyte pool. This monocyte pool will then be 
treated with GM -CSF then pulsed with HER -2/neu peptides and finally matured with INF -, and 
LPS for conversion into type 1 dendritic cells (DC1). When occurring at University of 
Pennsylvania a  study monitor will oversee quality assurance of vaccine production.  When 
occurring at Moffitt Cancer Center, all standard in stitutional quality assurance policies will be 
followed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.1.1 Subject Leukapheresis 
 
Subjects will first undergo leukapheresis to obtain lymphocyte and monocyte fractions. The 
leukapheresis will be performed in the pheresis facilities at the University of Pennsylvania  or at 
Moffitt Cancer center  by certified personnel. Subjects will be apheresed 15 -20 liters whole blood 
on a Gambro Spectra or equivalent apparatus. We expect to be able to generate 1 -5x1010 PBMC. 
In the event a subject  has poor  peripheral access, the option of having an internal jugular line 
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  15  
 placed by the interventional radiology division will be offered as an alternative.   At the time of    
the apheresiscollection, a tube of serum will be drawn and tested for a baseline  anti -HER-2/neu 
response.  This will then be compared with a specimen of serum that will be taken and tested 
post vaccine.  
 
For subjects in whom leukapheresis did not yield sufficient number of cells to make all 6 
vaccines and 3 booster vaccines (1.8x10^9 monoc ytes), an additional apheresis collection will be 
undertaken to yield enough cells to manufacturer the remaining vaccines.  . 
 
Subjects may additionally undergo leukapheresis (15 -20 liters) at the completion of the first 6 
vaccines to obtain adequate number s of the T lymphocyte population for immunologic analysis, as 
well as to obtain lymphocyte and monocyte fractions to produce 3 booster vaccines. For subjects 
in whom the initial and second leukapheresis did not yield sufficient number of cells to make all 6 
vaccines and 3 booster vaccines, an additional pheresis may be undertaken. At the completion of 
pheresis all IV access will be removed.  
 
Subjects will have 5mL of peripheral blood drawn at multiple time points during the vaccine 
schedule (pre vaccine, post six vaccines, pre booster 1, pre booster 2, pre booster 3, and 
completion of all vaccinations) to monitor immunologic responses to the administered vaccines. 
Subjects will also have the option to undergo additional leukapheresis (10 -15 liters) at the 
completion of the 6 vaccines or completion of the three boosters to obtain T lymphocyte 
population for additional immunologic analysis.

6.1.2 Elutriation  
 
To separate the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions, the apheresis product obtained will th en be 
subject to countercurrent centrifugal elutriation on a Model J -6M centrifuge (Beckman 
Instruments) equipped with a JE -5.0 elutriation rotor operating at 1725g and 20oC) or equivalent 
apparatus. The apheresis product is loaded onto the elutriator at 1 20cc/minute flow rate, then 
fractions are collected using stepwise increases in flow rates to obtain lymphocyte -rich (120  and  
140 cc/minute), transitional (150 cc/minute) and monocyte -rich (180 and 190 cc/minute) 
fractions. A final monocyte -rich fraction is collected at zero rpm (rotor off). Lymphocyte - rich 
fractions are then further purified with density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll -Hypaque to 
remove the red blood cells.  
 
The monocyte fraction is washed, counted and aliquoted out into portions fo r individual 
vaccines and cryopreserved for use at a later date.  
 
6.4.3. Cell culture and preparation of dendritic cell vaccine (Table 1)  
 
All elutriation will be performed in the FDA -approved facilities in the blood bank.  All work  here 
in the productio n of the monocytes will be performed following strict guidelines for sterility and 
will be done with Good Laboratory Practices. Ms. Mary Sell, Supervisor in the Cell Processing 
Center will oversee elutriation  at University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Linda Kel ly will oversee 
elutriation at Moffitt Cancer Center . The vaccine activation will take place in the FDA approved 
facility in the Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility (CVPF) in Maloney 6 of the Hospital 
of the University of Pennsylvania , or at the Cell Therapy Facility (CTF) at Moffitt Cancer Center,  
under Good Manufacturing Practices. The CVPF  and CTF are both accredited by the Foundation 
for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT). , will oversee vaccine 
production and  will be responsible for release of vaccine for clinical delivery  at 
University of Pennsylvania .  has 20 year’s experience with preparing clinical grade DC 
vaccines.  will oversee DC1 vaccine manufacturing at the Moffitt Cancer Center.

 For those subjects  transferring from University of Pennsylvania and receiving vaccines at Moffitt 
Cancer Center , elutriated product will be shipped cryopreserved and monitored using standard 
shipping methods already in place at the Cell Therapy Facility at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Those 
elutriated monocytes will be stored cryopreserved and activated into DC as described below. Any 
subjects newly enrolled at Moffitt Cancer Center will have elutriated product generated in the Cell 
Therapy Laboratory at Moffitt Cancer Center.  Any subject receiving vaccine or boost at Moffitt 
cancer center will be a registered patient of Moffitt Cancer Center . 
Monocytes will be washed 2 times in Hanks Buffer. Monocytes will be cultured with GM -CSF, 
IL-4, IFN-, and LPS for conversion into DC1. Monocytes at concentrations of 3x106 cells/ml 
will be cultured in serum free medium (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) with 50 ng/ml (250 
IU/ml) rhGM -CSF, and IL -4 1000 u/ml (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 20 ug/ml HER- 
2/neu peptides will be added to the culture on the morning of day 2. If, after thawing the 
cryopreserved cells, there is less than 85% cell viability, the exact number of cells needed for 
vaccine production will be cultured for one extra day in rhGM -CSF and vaccine administration 
will be moved back one day. Recombinant HER -2/neu peptides 3 ECD p42-56 
(HLDMLRHLYQGCQVV),  p98-114 (RLRIVRGTQLFEDNYAL),  p328- 
345(TQRCEKCSKPCARVCYGL) and 3 ICD p776-790 (GVGSPYVSRLLGICL), p927 -941 
(PAREIPDLLEKGERL)  and  p1166 -1180  (TLERPKTLSPGKNGV)  (American  Peptide    Co, 
Sunnyvale, CA) will be pulsed on day 2. The peptides will be pulsed in separate wells 2 -3 wells 
per peptide to avoid competition for binding in the MHC. The evening of day 2 IFN - (1000 
u/ml) will be adde d. Six – eighteen hours later LPS (10 ng/ml) will be added and the cells 
cultured an additional 2 -8 hours. For HLA -A2+ subjects, one hour prior to harvest, pulse DC1 in 
addition to above with 50ug/ml of HER -2/neu class I binding peptides into one well of e ach ECD 
and ICD with two different peptides (369 -377, 689-697). For HLA -A3+ subjects, one hour prior 
to harvest, pulse DC1 in addition to above with 50ug/ml of HER -2/neu class I binding peptide 
into one well of each ECD and ICD with one peptide (369 -377). In the event that HLA -A tissue 
typing results that have not been completed in time for the HLA -A2 peptide addition, will have 
the peptides added to the culture under the principle that if said patient is not HLA -A2+ or HLA - 
A3+ the peptides will not be abl e to bind properly and be washed away during the harvest of the 
vaccine.  The cells will then be harvested from the plates, washed three times with Hanks  
Buffer, counted and pooled. Viability will be determined by trypan blue exclusion.   About 2    to 
2.5 million DC1 from each peptide specificity will be pooled so that a total vaccine number of 
about 1.0 -2.0 x 107 cells resuspended in 20cc sterile saline. From this 20cc 5cc will be removed 
for gram stain, sterility testing, endotoxin testing and FACS analysis . These tests will be 
performed with this 5cc solution. The remainder of the cells, about 10 -20 million cells, will be 
centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in 1ml for administration. The final vaccine solution will 
be labeled with the subject’s name, dat e and time prior to release. The vaccine will be 
administered shortly after preparation. Long term, > 4 hour, storage of the vaccine is not 
anticipated. Short term storage of the vaccine at 40C will be accommodated for 4 -6 hours after 
which the vaccine wil l be discarded if not used. The vaccine prepared will be stored in the 
administration syringe 1cc tuberculin syringe at 40C and will be directly administered to the 
subject nodes.  A 22 or 23 gauge needle will be used for injection to prevent cell  lysis. 
 
A sample of each vaccine will be sent for endotoxin testing, gram stain , and Bac Tec and broth 
sterility cultures. An aliquot  of the clinical product will be submitted to the Department of 
Microbiology  or to the Cell Therapy Quality Control Lab at Moffitt  Cancer Center  and they will  
prepare a smear for gram stain testing. In addition, two tubes (or BacTAltert  blood culture 
bottles at Moffitt) will be inoculated and this will be sent to the Department of Microbiology  or 
to the Cell Therapy Quality Control Lab for sterility testing  A negative gram stain of the

required in order to clear the vaccine for subject administration. The endotoxin test will be 
performed according to Good Laboratory Practices in the CVPF. The results of endotoxin 
testing and microbiology cultures will be checked when available and if not meeting 
specifications the vaccine will be discarded. An endotoxin level of less than 5 EU/kg body 
weight will be accepte d. Sterility testing will be performed in accordance with CFR 610.12 and 
a specification of no growth will be required. A final quality analysis certificate will be issued for 
each dose of vaccine administered. (Appendix B). Additionally, cell viability of  the prepared 
vaccine will be determined using trypan blue staining. The results will be available prior to 
vaccine administration. Cell viability of >70% will be required for release of vaccine. If this 
cutoff is not met, then the vaccine will be re -made. In addition, a sample of each vaccine will 
also be removed for FACS analysis of cell surface markers to confirm conversion of monocytes 
to DC. Since the activity of the vaccine does not depend on phenotype the vaccine will not be 
held for phenotype but wi ll serve as an internal evaluation of the process of vaccine preparation 
(see below).  
The requirements for vaccine release then  are: 
Viability >70% 
gram stain result no organisms  
endotoxin test  <5EU/kg subject weight 
culture and sensitivity  no growth final  culture 
 
Since the culture test will become available after vaccine administration the following 
contingency plan will be in place for a positive culture:  
 Notification of both the primary attending physician and the  subject. 
 Identification of the responsi ble microorganism and sensitivity  testing. 
 A description of additional subject monitoring as required by the circumstances of the 
contamination  incident. 
 Initiate an investigation of the event and take corrective actions to prevent future 
recurrences. The scope of the investigation and proposed corrections should  include: 
o Evaluation of your current procedures for collecting and processing the 
autologous peripheral blood product to determine the step at which contamination 
could be introduced.  
o Development of  changes in the procedures that will assist in preventing sterility 
lapses in the  future. 
o Development of appropriate testing to ensure that revised changes to the 
procedures produce a sterile product. This should include sterility testing at 
various points  in the preparation of the  product. 
 Report the incident as an adverse event to the agency within 15 working  days. 
 
The first vaccine may be made from freshly collected and elutriated or cryopreserved cells. 
Subsequent vaccinations will be made from cryopre served aliquots. At the University of 
Pennsylvania, o nce thawed, these cells  will be washed with medium twice prior to their 
placement in  culture.At Moffitt Cancer Center, an individual vial will be removed from liquid 
nitrogen and allowed to thaw to room  temperature.  Once vial is fully thawed, the vaccine will be 
transferred from the vial into a syringe for injection.  The thawed vaccine will be stored at a cool 
temperature, around 4 degrees C.

6.4.4 Quality assurance of  DC1 
 
Surface markers on monocytes cells after treatment will be analyzed by FACS to in select 
products to determine whether they have converted to dendritic cells. After culture activation a 
small quantity of DC will be harvested for FACS analysis. Cells will b e stained with FITC 
labeled antibodies against human cell surface markers CD14 and PE labeled antibodies CD80, 
CD86 and CD83. Two color analyses will be performed on a Beckman FACscan with  
appropriate isotype matched control antibodies. Dead cells will be  gated using  propridium 
iodide. This facility is available through the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of 
Pennsylvania. The presence of the monocytic marker CD14, costimulatory molecule B7.1 and 
B7.2, MHC Class I and II and the expression of acce ssory molecules, CD40 and CD54 will be 
assessed using fluorescent multicolor flow cytometry. The conversion from monocytes to 
dendritic cells will be confirmed if the cells are CD80, CD86 and CD83 positive and have 
downregulated CD14. Flow cytometry will n ot be available for analysis until after the vaccine 
administration. The most useful measure of DC1 function will be a sample and will be analyzed 
for IL-12 production by standard ELISA. We utilize ELISA reagents purchased from Pharmigen 
according to the m anufacturer’s recommendation to measure secreted  IL-12. 
 
Table 1: Preparation of Dendritic Cell Vaccines: Summary of Procedure   
1. Suspend monocytes in serum free medium (SFM) to concentration of 3x106cells/ml. Plate 1cc 
of cell suspension/well in 64 well plate for a total of 12 -18 wells (60-80 at Moffitt) . Cells plated 
in numbers higher than actual dose to compensate for 50 -75% retrieval rate with  harvesting.  
 
2. If monocytes cryopreserved, thaw, add 20 cc Hanks Buffer and spin at 1200 rpm for 5 
minutes at 220C. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 cc medium.  Remove 20 µl for 
cell count. Use trypan blue to exclude dead cells from cell count.  Add 10 cc Hanks Buffer and 
spin again at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 220C. Resuspend to concentration of 3x 106 cells/ml in 
SFM and plate as above.   
 
 
3. Add rhGM -CSF for final concentration of 50 ng/ml or 250 IU/ml and IL -4 1000 u/ml (see IV 
Preparation of Reagents). Culture overnight.  If, after thawing the cryopreserved cells, there is 
less than 85% cell viability, the exact number of cells needed for vaccine production will be 
cultured for one extra day in rhGM -CSF and vaccine administration will be moved back one  day. 
 
4. The next morning, add HER -2/neu peptides for a final concentration of of 20µg/ml 3 ECD  - 
56, p98-114, p328 -345 and 3 ICD p776 -790, p927 -941 and p1166 -1180  These will be pulsed 
in separate  wells.

Version v2  03/01/2017  21  
  
5. In the afternoon, add IFN - 1000 u/ml, culture cells at 37o C and 5% CO2 overnight for 14 hours.  
 
6. The following morning, add LPS (10 ng/ml)  
 
7. Incubate 2-8 hours. 
 
8. For HLA-A2+ subjects, one hour prior to harvest, pulse DC1 in addition to above with 50 ug/ml 
HER-2/neu class I binding peptides into one well of each ECD and ICD with two different peptides 
(369-377 and 689 -697). For  HLA -A3+ subjects, one hour prior to harvest, pulse DC1 in addition to 
above with 50ug/ml of HER -2/neu class I binding peptide into one well of each ECD and ICD with 
one peptide (369 -377).  In the event that HLA -A tissue typing results have not been completed in 
time for the HLA -A2 peptide addition, will have the peptides added to the culture under the principle 
that if said patient is not HLA -A2+ or HLA -A3+ the peptides will not be able to bind properly and 
be washed awa y during the harvest of the vaccine.       
 
9. Harvest cells into 50cc Falcon tubes.  Maximum 20 cc cell volume and add 20 cc Hanks Buffer 
and spin at 1200 rpm for 5 minute @ 220C. Repeat this step, wash the cells again.  
 
10. Aspirate supernatant. Remove 20 µl for cell count to estimate % cell death. Pool 2 -2.5 million 
cells per each peptide and respin cells at 1200 rpm, 220C for 5 minutes.  Resuspend in 20cc sterile 
saline.  Remove 12 -18 million cells, about 15cc, for vaccine preparation and from the 5cc rem aining 
the tests of endotoxin, sterility testing, gram stain and FACS (see 6.5.4 Phenotypic Analysis of DC1 ) 
will be obtained.   The vaccine component will be centrifuged and resuspended to 1cc with a total 
cell number 1.0-2.0 x 107 cells.  
 
11. Label with subjects name, date  and time. Release for administration if cell viability >70% and 
gram stain no organisms seen Endotoxin testing must be less than 5 EU/kg body mass for 
administration.  At University of Pennsylvania, some of the tested material will be r eserved so that, 
in the event a contaminant is discovered in the process of sterility testing, we will have individual 
components to test so to determine the exact point of contamination.  
 
12. Remake the vaccine if cell viability <70%, positive gram stain,  or endotoxin level >5EU/kg. At 
Moffitt the vial will be removed from liquid nitrogen and allowed to thaw at room temperature.  
Once vial is fully thawed the vaccine will be removed from the vial and transferred into a syringe for 
injection.  The vaccine w ill be kept at a cool temperature, around 4 degrees C, until administration

Version v2  03/01/2017  24  
  
6.4.6 Administration of the  Vaccine 
 
A. Selection of Lymph nodes for  vaccination  
 
Ultrasound will be used to identify non -pathologic lymph nodes in the groin as first choice or 
axilla as second choice. Non -pathologic nodes by ultrasound criteria have a fatty hilum and   will  
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  25  
  
 
be selected; two nodes per vaccine preferentially 1 node per groin. If a patient has lymphedema  
or prior groin dissection on a single side then the contralateral groin will be used or alternatively 
the axilla. Often we only are able to identify 1 -2 nodes in the groin by ultrasound.  Nodes  
without a fatty hilum that have evidence of pathologic disease will be excluded from  injection.  
 
B. Administration of the initial  Vaccine 
 
Vaccines will be labeled (for example, with the subjects study ID, study initials, date and time ) 
prior to release. The  patient will be seen by the PI or designee, and Research Coordinator and a 
history and physical exam will be performed. Ultrasound (US) guided intranodal delivered 
vaccines will be administered in the NIH Clinical Research Center at Penn or the Clinical 
Research unit at Moffitt Cancer  Center by a radiologist or sonographer experience  in  
ultrasound  guidance  and   the  
principal investigators or his /her designee. Each dose will consist of between 1.0 -2.0 x 107 cells 
and will be injected into 1 -2 differen t normal groin lymph nodes or axillary nodes.  
 
C. Post vaccine  assessment  
 
Subjects will be administered the vaccine and observed.  All subjects with vaccine related AEs will 
be followed until the AE has resolved to baseline. Vital signs will be obtained prio r to the 
vaccination and again  15 minutes after the dose is given. Subjects with no noted complications will 
be then discharged. The anticipated complication could be fever.  If an adverse reaction is observed, 
the subject observation time  will be revised a ppropriately . A physician familiar with the study will 
be readily available in the event of any complication and such subjects will be transferred to an 
appropriate care unit for further monitoring and treatment  Similarly any discharged subject who 
develops symptoms will be promptly re -evaluated and admitted for care if inpatient hospitalization 
is deemed necessary by the principal investigator  or his/her designee. 
 
D. Vaccine Schedule 
 
The vaccine schedule is meant to be weekly; however the first 6 vaccines m ay be given 
anywhere between 8 -21 days apart. 
 
E. Vaccine Tolerance  
 
DC vaccination protocols on humans to date have not demonstrated serious toxicities and we 
anticipate that subjects on this protocol will also tolerate vaccination without incident. 
Specifically, our own HER -2/neu peptide pulsed DC1 protocol using this same regimen has been 
well tolerated. We have therefore designed this vaccination trial as a largely out -patient based 
protocol. However, should significant toxicities be noted this tri al as a result of the additional 
breast vaccinations, the trial will be amended to increase the period of patient observation 
accordingly.  
 
F. Administration of Second  Vaccine 
 
Between 8 and 21 days post vaccine 1 the subject will return for the second vaccin ation. Again a 
history and physical exam will be taken.  Any changes in history or physical will be documented.

6.5 Post-Vaccine Procedures  
 
A. In vitro Immunologic  testing 
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  30  
  
 
Subjects will have 5mL of peripheral whole blood drawn at multiple time points during the 
vaccine schedule (pre vaccine, post six vaccines, pre booster 1, pre booster 2, pre booster 3, and 
completion of all vaccinations) to monitor immunologic responses to the administered vaccines. 
Subjects will also have the option to undergo additional leukapheresis  (10-15 liters) at the 
completion of the 6 vaccines or completion of the three boosters to obtain T lymphocyte 
population for additional immunologic analysis.  The leukapheresis will be performed in the 
pheresis facilities at the University of Pennsylvania by certified personnel  or at Moffitt Cancer 
Center, if needed.  Attempts will first be made to obtain peripheral access for the pheresis 
protocol.  Subjects will be pheresed 15 -20 liters whole blood on a Gambro Spectra or equivalent 
apparatus.  We expect to be able to generate 1 -5x1010 PBMC. 
 
 
B. Post vaccine laboratory  studies 
 
In addition to the blood which will be drawn for the above analyses, an extra tube of serum will 
be drawn to test the subject’s anti -HER-2/neu response. After boost vaccines additional 5 tubes 
of whole blood will be obtained for immune analysis. T hese results will be compared with the 
immune response results that will have been obtained prior to vaccination. An alternative post 
vaccine leukapheresis can be performed as alternative to blood  draws. 
 
1. After receiving their  vaccines and prior to receiving boost vaccine  series, subject will 
have the following completed:   
 
a) CBC w/ differential  
b) PT/PTT 
c) electrolytes -Na/K/Cl/CO 2/BUN/Cr/glucose  
d) liver function  tests 
e) urinalysis  
f) MUGA or Echocardiogram (Compare to first  study) 
 
In addition to the blood drawn for the  above analyses, 5 tubes of whole blood will be obtained for 
immune analysis and tube of serum will be drawn to test subjects anti -HER-2/neu response.  These 
results will be compared with the immune response results that will have been obtained prior to 
vaccination.  
 
 
In the event of abnormal symptoms, laboratory monitoring may be done earlier. The laboratory 
studies and intervals at which they are done will be determined by the PI on a case by case basis.  
 
If significant decline in EF was evident in pre/post vaccine MUGA scan or ECHO, another 
MUGA scan or ECHO may be performed 1 month post -vaccine, as determined by the PI . 
Subjects will be closely monitored by the PI, who will determine the need for addition al MUGA 
scan(s) during the 6 month post -vaccine monitoring period on a case by case basis.  
 
C. Long-term Follow-up 
 
After completing the 6 month post -vaccine monitoring period, a ll subjects will be seen yearly. 
Mammograms will be obtained at yearly visits if patients have remaining breasts. For

years. 
 
6.6 Clinical Monitoring  
 
A. Monitor  
 
At University of Pennsylvania, m onitoring will be conducted by the PI and the Research 
Coordinators  in accordance with all applicable regulations.  Additionally, the PI and RC will meet 
with the Medical Monitoring Committee as needed to discuss the study and request additional 
monitoring support as necessary.   
 
At Moffitt Cancer Center, regulatory documents and case report forms will be monitored internally 
according to Moffitt Cancer Center Monitoring Policies. Monitoring will be performed regularly by 
the MCC Clinical Monitoring Core for accuracy, completeness, and source verification o f data 
entry, validation of appropriate informed consent process, reporting of SAEs, and adherence to the 
protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements .

. 
 
B. Initial Assessment  Monitoring  
 
This serves as early detection and will help identify trouble areas in the study, staff or site early 
enough in the study to allow corrections which will benefit the study long term. The PI and the 
RC will meet to review the study data and processes after each treatment (9 total) for the first  
two subjects. During the initial assessment monitoring, the PI will review all AE/SAE and lab 
abnormalities with the Radiologist, Medical Oncologist and/or Pathologist (as appropriate). 
AE/SAEs will be recorded on a study  specific Adverse Event form and all SAEs will be reported 
to the IRB, DSMC, Safety Monitoring Committee, GCRC, FDA, and NIH in accordance with all 
applicable regulations. All errors will be addressed and corrected at that time and training and 
study desig n related issues will be resolved in a timely  manner. 
 
C. Ongoing Monitoring  
 
During the course of the trial, safety and data quality monitoring will be performed in an on- 
going manner by the PI, RC and other applicable study staff. The RC will monitor the d ata 
quality every 6 week (s). This includes ensuring that all source documents exist for the data on 
the case report forms, ensuring all fields are completed appropriately, all corrections are done 
according to GCPs and any inconsistencies/deviation are do cumented.  The PI will review the  
lab results for each patient on an on -going basis and will document his review by signing and 
dating the lab report. The PI will also review all Adverse Event forms in real -time to ensure 
appropriateness of the data and t imeliness of reporting. All errors will be addressed at the time 
the monitoring takes place and when the PI reviews the safety data. The PI will also ensure that 
all renewals are received in a timely manner and all correspondences are documented. Issues 
related to staff training, protocol design, CRF design and monitoring frequency will be 
documented along with the appropriate corrective actions. Any issues uncovered will be 
addressed and corrected  immediately.  
 
Moffitt Cancer Center  
 
Regulatory documents and case report forms will be monitored internally according to 
Moffitt Cancer Center Monitoring Policies. Monitoring will be performed regularly by the 
MCC Clinical Monitoring Core for accuracy, completeness, and source verification of data 
entry, validat ion of appropriate informed consent process, reporting of SAEs, and 
adherence to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and applicable 
regulatory requirements . 
 
 
D. Data Quality  
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer

At University of Pennsylvania t he  RC will make s ure that all CRFs are completed, all changes to 
CRFs are made in accordance with regulations, source documents exist for all data points, the 
consent/re -consent process is clearly documented in the source records, investigational agent 
accountability is ma intain proactively and response is clearly documented. Paper CRFs will be 
utilized until electronic CRFs are available. After the first 1/3 of the subjects are enrolled, the RC 
and PI will  collectively review the charts of 3  randomly selected  subjects to ensure compliance 
with regulations and this plan. The collective review will again occur with a review of 3 subjects 
drawn from the next 1/3 of accrual and 3 subjects drawn from the final 1/3 of  accrual. 
 
E. Safety Monitoring  Committee  
 
At University of Penns ylvania , in the Department of Gynecology,  
 in the Department of Medical Oncology will be the 
Safety Monitoring Committee for this study. Neither  is 
directly involved in the trial. None of these physicians have any clinical trials in association with 
Dr. Czerniecki or . The Safety Monitoring Committee will meet every six months. 
Two weeks  prior to this meeting each committee member will receive a report of al l AEs and 
safety data prepared by the research coordinator. The committee will review all AEs including 
grading, toxicity assignments, all other safety data and activity data observed in the ongoing 
clinical trial at this meeting. They may recommend report ing of adverse events and relevant 
safety data not previously reported and may recommend suspension or termination of the trial. 
The initial meeting of this committee will be six months after the first patient is enrolled. The 
final meeting will be six mon ths after the final subject is  vaccinated.  
 
F. Study Changes 
 
All changes to the protocol and informed consent will be submitted to the IRB, NIH, FDA and 
CTSRMC in the form of a formal amendment for approval prior to conducting the study under 
the proposed changes. If said changes potentially affect the subject’s willingness to participate, 
each subject will be re -consented. Any changes to this monitoring plan will be submitted to the 
DSMC for approval prior to implementing the changes. In the event of an ea rly study  
suspension, the PI will immediately notify the IRB, NIH, FDA and  CTSRMC.  
 
G. Monitoring  Log 
 
At University of Pennsylvania a   monitoring log will be completed and maintained to document 
monitoring by the PI and RC.  Moffitt Cancer Center will follow  institutional procedures for 
monitoring of subjects that transfer care to the Center and are newly enrolled at the Center.  
 
H. Auditing 
 
This study will be audited by the Department of Compliance and Monitoring (DOCM) on behalf 
of the DSMC in accordance with  the NCI approved Institutional Data Safety and Monitoring  
Plan (DSMP).

The PMC meets monthly and reviews accrual, patterns and frequencies of all adverse events, 
protocol violati ons and when applicable, internal audit results.  
 
 
Monitoring by the DSMC will be at the following milestones: within 2 weeks of the sixth, or 
final, vaccination. Two weeks after each boost vaccine and two weeks after completion of post 
vaccine studies. Mo nitoring will be conducted on the first three subjects enrolled. The frequency 
of monitoring of additional subjects (e.g. every other or every third) will be determined after the 
review of the first three subjects. The frequency of monitoring is subject to  change if the DOCM 
feels it is necessary. The DOCM will be informed when each subject is enrolled, at which time 
the monitoring visits will be scheduled with the research coordinator.

6.7 Toxicity and Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
A. General Toxicity  
 
The HER -2/neu protein is expressed by the epithelial cells of normal breast, skin, 
gastrointestinal, respiratory, reproductive and urinary tissues. The HER -2/neu gene is not over - 
amplified in these normal cells and a level of protein expression is thus expected to be 
significantly lower than the gene over -amplification and protein over -expression seen in DCIS. 
In animal models of successful immunity to HER -2/neu protein using HER -2/neu ECD and ICD 
peptides, no evidence of autoimmunity has been noted. Additionally, in DC trials of melanoma 
and prostate, no cl inical evidence of autoimmunity directed against normal tissues sharing the 
targeted tumor antigen has been discovered. Therefore, although the risk is presumed to be 
minimal, the possibility of autoimmune disease directed at these normal tissues cannot be  
entirely excluded.  
 
This vaccine has not been previously administered to individuals who have been treated with 
Herceptin. Recent trials of Herceptin, the monoclonal antibody therapy to HER -2/neu ECD, have 
noted approximately 5% risk of cardiac toxicity l eading to heart failure. The mechanism appears 
to be related to presence of HER -2/neu on cardiac cells. The levels of HER -2/neu expression by 
cardiac myocytes, however, are extremely low, detectable only by PCR analysis.  
 
Subjects on this trial will have c ardiac evaluation of MUGA or echocardiogram to determine 
their ejection fraction. Subjects will also be closely monitored for signs/symptoms of heart 
failure. In our first trial there was no evidence of clinically relevant cardiac failure. Less than 8% 
of subjects had asymptomatic declines in ejection fractions post -vaccine, thought all EFs were 
still within normal range. There have been no long term cardiac toxicities noted as a result of this 
vaccine. Additionally, Herceptin does not cause long term cardi ac toxicity issues. We do not 
expect the cardiac toxicity of prior Herceptin treatment and treatment with the vaccine to be 
additive. 
 
It has been demonstrated that fetuses express HER -2/neu during the third trimester and there is 
the possibility of spontaneous abortion as a result of anti -HER-2/neu T cell responses against the 
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  35  
 fetus.  Therefore women of childbearing years will be made aw are of this possibility.

Version v2  03/01/2017  36  
  
 
B. Toxicity Definitions  
 
Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE version 4.02  
 
C. Toxicity Definition for  Leukapheresis  
 
Grade 1: Requirement for oral calcium supplementation either during or just after procedure. 
Severe bruising requiring treatment such as warm compresses or anti -inflammatory medication 
for a brief 1 week duration.  
 
Grade 2: Prolonged requirement for calcium administration greater than 24 hours, infection at 
the intravenous site requirin g treatment or intervention with antibiotics or surgery.  
 
Grade 3: Alteration in vital signs such as severe hypotension requiring hospitalization, 
hospitalization secondary to infection.  
 
D. Dose Limiting Toxicity  (DLT) 
 
Since the agent being administered is a biologic agent prepared from the subjects own cells as 
opposed to a single drug we will lump the toxicity together as that caused by the process of 
preparation of the DC vaccine. A subject that develops any grade 3 or greater toxicity per the 
NIH Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Toxicity Criteria version 4. 03 except for 
fever greater than 40oC for <12 hours will be taken off protocol.  A continuous monitoring rule 
for 
dose-limiting toxicity will be followed during the trial, as described in sectio n 6.11 Statistical 
Considerations.  
 
Grade 2 allergic reaction: generalized urticaria 
Greater than or equal Grade 3 allergic reaction 
Greater than or equal Grade 2 autoimmune reaction 
Greater than or equal Grade 3 cardiac toxicity  
Any Greater than or equal Grade 3 hematologic and non -hematologic toxicity. 
Greater than or equal Grade 2 toxicity for leukapheresis  
 
E. Adverse Events 
 
Adverse events will be graded according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 4. 03 
seehttps://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.ht ml.  A copy is enclosed in the Appendix.

6.8 Immunologic  Testing 
 
To ascertain the immunologic efficacy of the prepared vaccines, several parameters will be 
investigated at the initiation and then again at the conclusion of the four vaccine regimen. These 
include in vitro sensitization assays to determine the development of HER -2/neu CD4+ and CD8+ 
T  cell  precursors.    For  each  subject,  immunologic  evaluations  on  pre  and  post vaccination  
samples will be conducted simultaneously to minimize discrepancies in technique and culture 
conditions.  
 
To assess the in vivo immunologic effects of our DC vaccine, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells will be 
assessed before and after the vaccine protocol for qualitative evidence of HER -2/neu 
sensitization.   In addition T cells from the sentinel node will be tested post vaccinat ion.   If   this

Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  43  
  
 
Administration of HER -2/neu pulsed DC may result in several potential complications. First the 
administration of activated DC may cause transient hypotension from release of cytokines. This 
is a theoretic possibility and has not been observed in mouse models or human trials 
administering DC alone without IL -2 or other cytokines. The second possible complication 
includes the induction of autoimmune reactions to normal epithelial cells expressing the HER - 
2/neu antigen. However,  in animal models of successful immunity to HER -2/neu protein using 
HER-2/neu ECD and ICD peptides, no evidence of autoimmunity has been noted. Additionally, 
in DC trials of melanoma and prostate, no clinical evidence of severe autoimmunity directed 
against normal tissues sharing the targeted tumor antigen has been discovered. To date, in our 
own trial using peptide pulsed DC1s for vaccination in subjects with DCIS, the protocol has been 
well tolerated with toxicities of grade 1 fever, chills, headache, fat igue, and injection site 
tenderness.  
 
Recent data from studies of Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER -2/neu, have 
reported a small incidence of cardiomyopathy likely related to low level expression of HER - 
2/neu on cardiac cells. The risk of this complication is estimated at 5%. This toxicity is a result 
of an antibody and it is anticipated that with low level expression that T cells will be able to 
discriminate against the heart. In addition since the heart cells are MHC class II negative CD4 + 
T cells would not interact with these cardiac cells.  
 
This vaccine has not been previously administered to individuals who have been treated with 
Herceptin. Subjects on this trial will have cardiac evaluation of MUGA or echocardiogram to 
determine their ejection fraction. Subjects will also be closely monitored for signs/symptoms of 
heart failure. In our first trial there was no evidence of clinically relevant cardiac failure. Less 
than 8% of subjects had asymptomatic declines in ejection fractions post -vaccine, thought all 
EFs were still within normal range. There have been no long term cardiac toxicities noted as a 
result of this vaccine. Additionally, Herceptin does not cause long term cardiac toxicity issues. 
We do not expect the cardiac toxicity of pr ior Herceptin treatment and treatment with the vaccine 
to be additive. 
 
It has been demonstrated that fetuses express HER -2/neu during the third trimester and there is 
the possibility of spontaneous abortion as a result of anti -HER-2/neu T cell responses a gainst the 
fetus.  Therefore women of childbearing years will be made aware of this possibility.  
 
8.0 Consent Procedure  
 
The nature of the study and the procedures to be performed will be reviewed with the subjects by 
the Principal Investigator  or his/her designee. The subjects will be given ample time to ask 
questions and decide on participation in the study. A consent form will be signed and kept in the 
research file and a copy on the patient’s chart. Any patient given vaccine or boost at Moffitt will 
be re-consented using Moffitt Cancer Center consent form.  
 
9.0 Protection of Subjects  
 
Subject records and data sheets will be kept in individual research files. The subject’s chart will 
document participation in the study with the protocol name and number.  Under no circumstance  
Pilot Phase I HER -2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence for Patients with HER -2 Driven High Risk Invasive Breast Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  44  
  
 
will any medical record or donor information be issued to persons outside this study unless 
deemed medically indicated. Donor confidentiality will be maintained in any manuscripts or 
documents that are prepared for scientific publication. All routine safe medical practices applied 
to subjects with IBC will be used to keep this protocol as safe as possible for the subjects treated. 
Once IND officially moved to Moffitt Cancer Center and IRB approvals noted records of the  
trial and data will be transported to  Moffitt Cancer Center using secured Aegis Fortress 
encryption drive to regulatory site at Moffitt Cancer  Center. 
 
10.0 Potential Benefits  
 
For subjects enrolled in this trial there is no evidence to suggest any likelihood of benefit. The 
subjects enrolled  have significant risk of systemic recurrence and targeting HER -2/neu may 
reduce the risk of subsequent recurrence and if this study is safe and generates immune responses 
would lead to additional trials to test for reducing recurrence.  
 
11.0 Exceptions an d Deviations  
 
 
There will be no exceptions to eligibility, contraindicated treatment/therapies/interventions or safety 
tests. 
 
An exception is a one time, intentional action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC 
approved study protocol, intended for one occurrence. If the action disrupts the study progress, such 
that the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the 
safety and welfare of study subjects, advance documented approval will be requested from the IRB, 
DSMC, Moffitt Cancer Center PMC and Safety Monitoring Committee.  
 
A deviation is a one time, unintentional action or process that departs from the IRB and DSMC 
approved study protocol, involving one incident and identified retrospectively, after the e vent 
occurred. If the impact on the protocol disrupts the study design, may affect the outcome (endpoints) 
or compromises the safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation will be reported to the DSMC 
and Safety Monitoring Committee within 5 business d ays and to the IRB within 10 business days.  
 
 
12.0 Risk/Benefit Ratio  
 
In breast cancer, there remain a significant proportion of subjects who will not benefit from the 
current adjuvant therapies and relapse with metastatic disease. Immunotherapy offers a new 
approach to adjuvant therapy and one that may even be applied in prevention of breast cancer. 
Therefore, the immunologic information gathered from studies such as this one have the  
potential to impact large numbers of subjects with breast cancer or at  high risk for breast cancer. 
The recent DC trials for melanoma and prostate have demonstrated that such vaccines can be 
administered safely without adverse effects. Therefore, with minimal risk to the  subjects  
enrolled in this study, information will be  gathered that can determine the feasibility of a whole 
new approach for breast cancer  care.

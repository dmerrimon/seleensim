 PRÉCIS  
Background 
• Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare papillomatous disease of the 
aerodigestive tract  that is caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). 
• RRP can progress to cause airway compromise, fatal pulmonary lesions, and invasive cancers.  
• There is no effective systemic therapy for RRP. Patients typically require repeated 
interventional procedures for disease control. 
• A recently completed phase II clinical trial investigating avelumab in subjects with 
aggressive RRP demonstrated an acceptabl e safety profile  from  avelumab  and a high rate of 
partial responses . 
• RRP is characterized by frequent expression of PD-L1 and TGF-beta in the tumor 
microenvironment. 
• This clinical trial will evaluate the activity of M7824, a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against human PD-L1 (avelumab) fused, via a flexible glycine-serine linker, to the soluble extracellular domain of human TGF-β receptor II (TGF -βRII), which functions as a TGF- β “trap.” This drug was selected for its 
demonstrated activity in a variety of cancers and for its acceptable safety profile.  
Objective  
• Determine the complete response rate for M7824 in the treatment of patients with RRP.  
Eligibility  
• Histologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP.  
• One of the following:  
o A Derkay anatomic score of 10 or greater  and a  history of two or more endoscopic 
interventions in the last 12 months for control of RRP. 
o Pulmonary RRP with pulmonary disease that is measurable by computed tomography 
scan.  
o Tracheal involvement with RRP that has required either two or more endoscopic interventions in the last 12 months or a tracheostomy. 
• Age 18 years or greater. 
• Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.  
Design  
• This is a p hase II clinical trial  with two cohorts that will enroll simultaneously.  
• Cohort 1 will consist of subjects who have not been treated previously with an immune 
checkpoint inhibitor. Cohort 2 will consist of subjects wh ose disease has  been treated 
previously with and refractory to an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Each cohort will have a Simon optimal two -stage design with initial enrollment of 12 patients and expansion to 21

1.2 B
ACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis ( RRP ) 
RRP is a rare but difficult -to-treat and sometimes fatal neoplastic disease of the aerodigestive 
tract. RRP is cau sed by infection with human papillomavirus ( HPV) type 6 or 11, or more rarely 
type 16 ( 1). Approximately 1,500 new cas es of RRP are diagnosed each year in the United States  
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020

 (2). RRP  is classified based on age of onset as juvenile or adult. Juvenile- onset disease has an 
incidence of 4/100,000 and tends to have an aggressive clinical course.  Adult -onset RRP has an 
incidence of 2 -3/100,000 and tends to have a more  indolent clinical course. RRP m orbidity and 
mortality result s from  papilloma  mass effects on the vocal cords, airways, or lungs. This may 
cause voice chan ges, stridor, airway occlusion, loss of lung volume, and/or pneumonia ( 3). 
Repeated procedures  are required to debulk and monitor the disease, which exposes patients to 
anesthetic and surgical risk, and emotional distress. It is estimated that the economic cost of RRP 
is $150M in the United States each year  (2). Although rare (one to three percent of cases) RRP 
can transform into invasive squamous cell carcinoma ( 4). Subsequent mortality is based upon the 
clinical stage of the malignancy at the time of diagnosis. 
There is no cure for RRP . The mainstay  of treatment is endoscopic debulking with ablation or 
excision of papillomatous lesions. Surgical principles dictate that, to minimize morbidity from treatment,  papillomatous disease but not normal appearing epithelium is removed. It is thought 
that latent HPV viral particle s persist in an inactive state in the clinically -normal mucosa and 
subsequently become re activated leading to RRP recurrence ( 5
). Patients with juveni le-onset 
RRP require on average 20 surgeries over their lifetime to control their disease ( 6). Patients with 
adult-onset RRP generally  requir e fewer  interventions; nonetheless greater than 50% will require 
5 or more procedures  to control symptoms ( 7). Adjuvant systemic therapies have been tested in 
clinical trials , including systemic interferon- α and local  injection of anti -viral and antiangiogenic 
agent s (5). Study results have been inconsistent, and no single adjuvant a pproach has been 
widely adopted or accepted as the standard of care.  
RRP is caused by HPV infection.  HPV infections are common, but most individuals clear the virus without manifesting papillomas, dysplasia, or invasive cancers ( 8
).  Why some 
immunocompetent individuals are unable to eliminate the virus and therefore develop papillomatosis is not understood.  Local therapies fail to eradicate the disease apparently due to chronic persistence of latent virus in normal appearing mucosa. This notion is supported by a study demonstrating the presence of HPV DNA in the clinically healthy mucosa of patients with RRP (
9, 10 ). Efforts  to study systemic immunotherapy for RRP have been limited.  Adjuvant 
IFN-α after papilloma treatment was shown to increase  short-term time to recurrence but did not 
demonstrate long- term benefit ( 11).  
Programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) exp ression on tumor cells has been associated  strongly with 
poor prognosis in a variety of human cancers. ( 12) In recent years, a number of agents targeting 
the p rogrammed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 pathway have received regulatory appr oval, 
demonstrating impressive durations of response for multiple  tumor types, including melanoma, 
non-small cell lung  cancer, renal cell  cancer , and head and neck cancer ( 13-17 ). Notably, 
atezolizumab , durvalumab and avelumab are all anti–PD -L1 antibodies with proven efficacy and 
regulatory approval. Study of a small number of RRP samples by our group has shown PD- L1 
expression by inflam matory mononuclear cells and by papilloma epithelial cells  (18). In 
response to this data, we recently completed a phase II study investigating the role of avelumab in patients with aggressive RRP. We found that while the majority of patients de monstrated 
partial responses to single agent avelumab (
Figure 1) , no complete responses were achieved.  
Toxicities were generally mild and comparable to previous safety data with avelumab.

1.2.2 TGF -β/ TGF βR1 signaling pathway 
In an effort to increase the rate of response to these therapies, clinical trials are evaluating anti –
PD-1/PD-L1 agents in combination with other immunotherapies ( 19). Importantly, combined 
inhibition  of PD -L1 and TGF- β is a promising  therapeutic strategy because these key pathways 
have independent immunosuppressive functions.  
Transforming growth factor β (TGF -β) is a pleiotropic cytokine. In patients with cancer, TGF -β 
is associated with malignant progression, evasion of immune surveillance, invasion, and 
metastasi s (20, 21 ). TGF -β Receptor 1 (TGF βR1) pathway signalling  and overexpression have 
also been found to be significantly associated with HPV+ cancers  (22). Based on two genome 
wide association studies (GWAS) which compared patients with upper aero-digestive (n= 2091) and cervical cancers (n=617) to cancer free patients (8,334 and 512 respectively), an integrative computational analysis (including single-gene, gene-interconnectivity, protein–protein interaction, gene expression, and pathway analysis) looked to identify immune genes and pathways significantly associated with HPV+ cervical and oropharyngeal cancer. They found that TGF βR1 expression and downstream signalling was significantly increased in HPV+ 
cervical cancer and head and neck cancer s (
22). Similarly, TGF -β has been shown to be 
significantly expressed in the microenvironment of RRP specimens ( 23). 
 The direct effects of TGF -β on T cells include decreases in perforin, granzymes, interferon 
gamma, Fas ligand, and natural killer group 2D (NKG2D). It can also decrease NKG2D and major histocomp atibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide sequence A (MICA) in natural 
killer ( NK) cell s (24
). Elevated levels of TGF -β have been found to correlate with poor outcomes 
in many different human cancer s (25). Antibodies (e.g., fresolimumab) and small- molecule 
inhibitors (e.g., galunisertib) targeting the TGF- β pathway have entered clinical development, 
where they have shown promise in hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma (
26).

 1.2.3 M7824 
M7824 is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a fully human IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody against human PD-L1 fused, via a flexible glycine-serine linker, to the soluble extracellular domain o f human TGF- β receptor II (TGF -βRII), which functions as a TGF- β 
“trap.” The anti -D-L1 moiety of M7824 is based on avelumab (MSB0010718C), which is 
currently in Phase III  clinical trials in multiple tumor types and was recently FDA approved for 
metastatic Merkel cell Carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma ( 27, 28
). Preclinical studies have 
shown its ability to simultaneously bind PD- L1 and TGF -β, as well as appropriately block PD -
L1 signaling and TGF- β signaling in vitro. M7824 was shown to have better antitumor efficacy 
than anti- PD-L1 or TGF -β trap  control (a mutated antibody that doesn't bind to PD-L1, linked 
with the TGF -β trap ) in both MC38 and EMT-6 tumor models in both wild- type mice and B cell 
deficient mice . Because M78 24 is very immunogenic in mice, due to the fully human antibody 
and its immunos timulatory mechanism of action , host anti-drug antibodies preclude continued 
dosing. In an orthotopic EMT- 6 breast cancer model using B cell -deficient Jh mice M7824 
showed much better activity than either anti -PD-L1 antibody alone or TGF- β trap control  
(Figure 2)

tumors showing significantly reduced tumor volume with M7824 ( anti-PD-L1/TGFβ)  compared with 
either anti -PDL1 antibody or TGF- β trap alone.  
At tumor re -challenge, 13/13 mice previously cured with M7824 treatment had complete 
protection. Furthermore, M7824 therapy extended survival in a dose dependent manner. Similar 
results were also observed in the MC38 colorectal carcinoma model. Furthermore, depletion studies in MC38 model demonstrated that both CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and NK cells are required for tumor rejection ( Figure 3).

:  Antibody -based, selective depletion of immune effector cell subsets showed that both CD8+ 
cytotoxic T cells and NK cells are required for tu mor rejection with M7824 (Anti -PD-L1/TGFβ Trap) in 
MC38 model.  
 
In in vivo  studies, not only did M7824 decrease TGF- β in the serum and bind PDL1 within the 
tumor, it also substantially increased CD8+ T- cell and NK cell infiltration within the tumor, 
while decreasing myeloid -derived suppressor cell (MDSC) infiltration, compared with an anti–
PD-L1 antibody control. 
Based on these preclinical data, a Phase I  3+3 dose- escalation study was completed to evaluate 
the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability, and biological and clinical activity of M7824 in 
patients with advanced solid tumors ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Sixteen heavily  pretreated patients received M7824 at 1, 3, 10, or 20 mg/kg once- every -2-weeks. 
M7824 was shown to saturate peripheral PD-L1 at doses ≥  3 mg/kg and sequester plasma TGF -
β1, -β2, and - β3 (Figure 4) throughout the dosing period at ≥1 mg/kg. The only DLT observed 
was colitis with associated anemia (20 mg/kg). No MTD was reached. Grade 3 treatment -related 
adverse events occurred in 3 patients (skin infection secondary to localized bullous pemphigoid 
(3 mg/kg), asymptomatic lipase increase (20 mg/kg), and colitis (20 mg/kg) with associated anemia).  These toxicities are on par with other PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The only added toxicity 
seen over traditional PD-1/PD- L1 inhibitors was the occurrence of keratoacanthomas which have 
been described previously with TGFβ inhibitors  (29
).  Keratoacanthomas appear in 
approximately 10% of treated patients, but usually resolve with discontinuation of therapy. There were no treatment -related grade 4 –5 events. Based upon this safety data the decision was made 
to treat subsequent patient cohorts with a dose of 1,200 mg IV once every 2 weeks. This dose has been used in several phase Ib expansion cohorts treating more than 500 patients. This dose has been recommended for all phase II trials using M7824.

In addition, in the ongoing Phase I study of M7824 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), substantial clinical 
evidence has been seen in 4 of 9 subjects  (44%) with HPV -associated malignancies, including 2 
of 5 patients (40%) with metastatic cervical cancer,  1 of 2 patients (50%) with metastatic anal 
cancer  and 1 of 2 patients (50%) with metastatic P16+ head and neck cancer have had substantial 
clinical benefit.

 Figure 5: This 56- year-old woman with initially locally advanced cervical cancer status post 
(s/p) cisplatin/RT developed metastases to lung within 3 months of initial treatment. Then went 
on to receive topotecan/taxol plus bevacizumab and was enrolled on phase I of M7824 with enlarging right-sided lung masses (arrows in left side of figure). She received 2 doses of M7824 at 20 mg/kg but then developed colitis necessitating drug discontinuation. Despite this her restaging scan at 12 weeks showed marked reduction in disease volume (right side of figure).  
This includes a subject  with metastatic cervical c ancer with a 25% reduction  (by long axis 
measurement)  in her disease at 3 months ( Figure 5), a subject  with metastatic P16+ head and 
neck cancer with an unconfirmed partial response 6 weeks after startin g treatment, a patient w ith 
metastatic anal cancer with normalization of tumor markers and an ongoing durable partial response 9 months after starting treatment and a patient with metastatic cervical cancer with normalization of tumor markers and an ongoing durable complete response for more than a year .     
This e arly data from a small cohort of subjects  with HPV- associated malignancies in this  phase 1 
trial of M7824 suggests that this agent, which targets both PD-L1 and TGF- β pathways, may 
produce responses at a higher rate as compared with other single agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Here, we aim to assess the clinical response rate following treatment with M7824 in subjects with aggressive RRP.

the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, liver disease, lung disease ( with 
the exception of what is specified in inclusion criteria in section 2.1.1.1) , or laboratory abnormalities  that, in the opinion of the investigators , may increase the risk associated 
with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to  
receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results
 and in the 
judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.  Patients w ith mild to moderate asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) well controlled with oral or inhaled medications are permitted to enroll.  
2.1.2.2 Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, are permitted to enroll.  
2.1.2.3 Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration.  Inhaled , topical intranasal or intro -ocular steroids,

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1.1 General study plan   
This prot ocol is a phase II study of M7824. The protocol will enroll subject s with  an RRP  
disease burden that requires repeated surgical  procedures for  management .  Patients with  a 
pathologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP will be screened for this protocol.  P atients who 
appear to be eligible for treatment will be examined via flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy 
and/or tracheoscopy by the Otolaryngology Service. Patients  that meet the eligibility  criteria  will 
be enrolled onto  the study. This study will have two cohorts: (1) patients who are checkpoint 
inhibitor naive, and (2) patients whose RRP disease is refractory to checkpoint inhibition. After enrollment, patients will undergo exam under anesthesia (EUA) staging of RRP with biopsies to 
confirm baseline staging, debulk disease that poses an impending airway risk  and rule out 
invasive cancer . Patients will complete the Voice Handicap Index -10 at this time.  The voice 
handicap index- 10 (VHI -10) is a patient- based self -assessment tool that quantifies a patients’ 
perception of their voice handicap. It consists of 10 questions that cover three domains: functional, physical and emotional aspects of voice disorders. There is a positive correlation 
between improvement in anatomic Derkay score and  mean VHI -10 score ( 35).  
With amendment D, cohort 2 will be closed to enrollment. Two patients were enrolled and treated on this cohort with no response. Due to the lack of perceived clinical benefit  seen thus far 
in this patient cohort and in previous clinical trials testing M7824 in patients with metastatic HPV- associated cancers  that were refractory to checkpoint inhibitors, the checkpoint refractory 
cohort will be closed to further enrollment.  
An optional leukapheresis will be performed prior to the first dose of M7824 (see Section 5.1.1).  
If patients  are willing, they will also be enrolled on protocol 16C0061 for banking of 
biospecimens. During EUA, samples for research will be obtained from those patients who enroll on protocol 16C0061 for banking of biospecimens.  
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 18 
 M7824 will be administered at a dose of 1200 mg flat dose IV eve ry 2 weeks (+/ - 3 days).  EUA 
and endoscopy will be performed  to assess airway , RRP lesion  inflammation and  to obtain 
research biopsies 2 weeks after the first dose of M7824 (9 -17 days after the first dose).  An 
optional leukapheresis will also be obtained at this time point. These procedures should occur 
before the second dose of M7824. Disease response will  first be assessed  six weeks  after the first 
dose of M7824 ( +/- 10 days ), which corresponds to the end of the first course (3 doses) of 
M7824, by clinic -based endoscopic examination, Voice Handicap Index -10 and imaging if 
appropriate.  These procedures should occur before the Course 2 Cycle 1  Day 1 dose of M7824, 
if applicable . If patients have a complete response or no response or Disease progression, 
treatment will be discontinued  at that time . If patients have a partial response, treatment will be 
continued for up to 6 additional weeks  (12 weeks total treatment ) or until disease progression or 
complete response. If subjects demonstrate a partial response and receive an additional 6 weeks 
of treatment their responses will again be measured after completing this additional treatment (+/- 10 days). Patients that have a partial response at the end of course 2 can choose to receive 
more courses of therapy  (maximum of 2) or conclude therapy. Patients will be assessed after 
each course. At the conclusion of treatment all patients will undergo EUA and endoscopy with 
either st andard of care surgical debulking of their disease or biopsies to confirm complete 
regression of papillomatous disease. The primary endpoint of this study is complete response to treatment , but patients will be followed long- term after completion of treatment to assess timing 
and frequency of future interventions.   
If a patient’s condition precludes safe performance of any protocol-driven biopsy, apheresis or 
other research procedure, the procedure may be delayed for an additional two weeks or canceled  
at the discretion of the investigator. This will not be considered a protocol deviation.  Endoscopy may be omitted in patients with disease that is not endoscopically accessible.

RUG ADMINISTRATION  
3.2.1 M7824 
M7824 will be administered via peripheral IV at a dose of 1200 mg IV every other week  for up 
to 12 weeks total (6 cycles) .  All patients will be pre -treated with an antihistamine  and 
acetaminophen approximately 30-60 minutes prior to each dose (for example, 25-50 mg 
diphenhydramine and  500-650 mg acetaminophen ). M7824 is to be diluted as described in 
section 11.1.4. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection.   M7824 will be infused at 60 mL/hour for 10 minutes; if no infusion reaction observed then rate 
will be increased to 120 mL/hour for 10 minutes; if no infusion reaction observed then rate will 
be increased to 250 mL/hour for the remainder of the infusion. If infusion reactions are observed, the infusion rate may be decreased to the previous rate at w hich it was tolerated. At the end of 
the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.  See Section 3.4.4 for 
infusion reaction guidance. 
M7824 will be infu sed in the NIH Clinical Center Day H ospital or on an inpatient oncology 
ward.  Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature) will be assessed before 
infusion, at each rate change, at completion of infusion, and every 1 hour (+/- 15 minutes) or 
more frequently as clinically indicated  for 2 hours after completion of the infusion or until stable.   
Medications readily available for the emergency management of anaphylactoid reactions should include: epinephrine (1:1000, 1 mg/mL) for subcutaneous injection, diphenhydramine hydrochloride for intravenous injection, and resuscitation equipment.

N-STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
See the section  3.5, Study calendar for details. 
3.4 DOSE MODIFICATIONS /DELAY  
Dose modifications are not permitted.  
3.4.1 Doses will be delayed for the following: 
• Any Grade 2 or greater drug- related adverse event  with the  following exceptions : 
o Grade 2 skin rash or fatigue 
o Grade 2 infusion reaction in which the full dose of the drug is safely infused, 
per instructions in section 3.4.4 
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication   
• Algorithms for management of toxicities are provided in Section  13.3 
3.4.2 Resuming treatment 
Subjects may resume treatment with M7824 under any  of the following circumstances: 
• Any grade 2 event that resolves to grade 1 or less within 14 days without systemic steroid treatment  
• Grade 3/4 rash that improves to Grade 1/2 with treatment 
• Grade 2/3/4 endocrinopathy that responds to  treatment/replacement therapy   
3.4.3 Discontinuing treatment 
Treatment should be permanently discontinued for the following: 
• Any Grade 3 or 4 drug- related adverse event with the exception of criteria listed in 
3.4.2 
3.4.4 M7824 infusion reactions 
Since M7824 contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences it is unlikely to be immunogenic and induce an infusion or hypersensitivity reaction. However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus , arthralgias, 
hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 5.0) guidelines. 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 22 
 NCI-CTCAE Grade  Treatment Modification for Study Drug  
Grade 1 – mild   
Mild transient reaction; infusi on interruption 
not indicated; intervention not indicated. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from 
symptoms.  
Decrease the study drug infusion rate by 50% and monitor 
closely for any worsening.  Complete the remainder of the 
infusion at the reduced  rate (50% of initial infusion rate) . 
The total infusion time for study drug should not exceed 4 
hours. 
Grade 2 – moderate 
Therapy or infusion interruption indicated 
but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment (for example, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics,  corticosteroids, 
bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤  24 hours. Stop study drug infusion.  Once infusion- related reaction 
has resolved or decreased to G rade 1 in severity, r esume 
infusion at 25% of previous rate  for 15 minutes, then 
increase to 50% of previous rate, and monitor closely for 
any worsening. 
The total infusion time for study drug should not exceed 4 
hours. 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 – severe or 
life-threatening ; urgent intervention 
indicated.  Grade 3: Prolonged (for example, 
not rapidly responsive to symptomatic 
medication and/or brief interruption of 
infusion); recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improvement; hospitalization 
indicated for  other clinical sequelae   [e.g., 
renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). 
Grade 4: (life- threatening; pressor or 
ventilator support indicated). 
 
 Immediately discontinue infusion of study drug. Begin an 
IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject a s 
follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV 
administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. 
Subject should be monitored until the investigator is 
comfortable that the symp toms will not recur. Study drug 
will be permanently discontinued. In the case of late -
occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after 
treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given ( e.g., oral 
antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  Subjects must be 
withdrawn immediately from study drug treatment and 
must not receive any further study d rug treatment.  
IV = intravenous; NCI-CTCAE = National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event; NSAIDs
 = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Once the M7824 infusion rate has been decreased by 50% or interrupted due to an 
infusion-related reaction, it must remain decreased for all subsequent infusions.  If a subject experiences a Grade 3 or 4 infusion -related reaction at any time, the subject must discontinue 
study drug. 
3.4.5 Keratoacanthomas  
Keratoacanthomas are expected to form in a subset of patients on this protocol. They will not be 
considered stopping criteria. Patients will be asked at every NIH visit whether they have developed any skin lesions. If they have, the patient will be referred to Dermatology for 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 23 
 characterization and clinical recommendations. The need for intervention should be assessed on 
a case -by-case basis with input from the primary team, the patient, and the Dermatology consult 
service.   
3.4.6 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu -Like Symptoms  
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subject must be treated according to the best available medical practice. Subjects should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the Investigator immediately.  
For prophylaxis of flu-like symptoms, 25 mg of indomethacin or comparable nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) dose (for example, ibuprofen 600 mg, naproxen sodium 
500 mg) may be administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each dose of M7824 IV infusion.  Alternative treatments for fever (for example, paracetamol) may be given to subjects at the discretion of the Investigator. 
3.4.7 Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
In addition, since M7824 can induce antibody- dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity, there is a 
potential risk of tumor lysis syndrome.  Should this occur, subjects should be treated per the local 
guidelines.

(end of treatment) , which occurs 42 days (+/- 10 days)  after last study treatment, will satisfy safety visit requirements as noted in section 3.6. If 
unwilling or unable to travel to the NIH Clinical Center for follow-up visits, patients will be contacted by telephone regarding their status, and may 
be asked to send labs and physical exam reports to fulfill visit requirements.  
r Patients who do not experience a response to treatment will be contacted annually (+/ - one month) for 2 years  following the last dose of study 
drug to document additional disease recurrence and treatments that they have received.  For the safety  follow -up visit which should occur 
approximately 42 days (+/- 10 days) after last study treatment (as noted in section 3.6), if unwilling or unable to travel to the NIH Clinical Center, 
patients will be contacted by telephone regarding their status, and may be asked to send labs and physical exam reports to fulfill end of treatment 
safety follow- up visit requirements.   Annual follow-up contact may occur via telephone or email . 
s As indicated in section 10.4, all subjects will be offered the opportunity to complete an NIH advance directives form.  This should be done 
preferably at baseline but can be done at any time during the study as long as the capacity to do so is retained.  The comple tion of the form is 
strongly recommended, but is not required. 
t As noted in Section 3.2.1. 
u Computed tomography scan of the neck and/or chest only if patients have known or suspected pulmonary RRP.  See Section 2.2.1.4.  
v See section 5.1 for information on specimen collection timepoints. 
w Adverse events will be assessed prior to each dose of M7824 and  every week by telephone between on- site assessments ( Telephone 
communication with patient to assess for any symptoms suggestive of an adverse event; this will be performed by physician or research nurse.  
Symptoms of myocarditis (chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling of ankles or feet , bleeding) will be assessed).

5.1.3 Research studies  
• Biospecimens will be collected for research  to identify biomarkers of response, 
understand the mechanism of action of the treatment, and investigate the biology of RRP.  
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 33 
 • Research studies will be considered exploratory analyses and may include : assessment of 
PD-L1 expression by papillomas and papilloma- infiltrating immune cells, testing of 
papillomas and normal appearing mucosa for HPV, evaluation of papillomas by 
nanostring and evaluation of papilloma- infiltrating T cell responses against HPV 
antigens. 
• Testing of papilloma -infiltrating T cells and peripheral blood T cells for recognition 
of HPV antigens ( 30).  
Generation and isolation of T cells 
Papilloma -infiltrating T cells may  be generated from papilloma biopsy specimens by 
culture of 2 mm tissue fragments in culture media with IL -2. Lymphocyte cultures 
may be split when confluent and cryopreserved when sufficient cells have been 
generated. Flo w cytometry may be performed to assess the lymphocyte populations 
using markers such as CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD56 to assess lymphocyte subtypes. T 
cells may  be isolated from peripheral blood samples by magnetic bead separation 
using standard techniques from commercially available kits  (Miltenyi or similar) . 
HPV- specific T cell response assays  
Target cells for assays measuring HPV -specific T cells responses may  be autologous 
immature dendritic cells (DCs) generated from apheresis samples. The DCs may  be 
loaded  with pools of overlapping peptides spanning each of the viral antigens 
encoded by HPV. Reactivity against each antigen will be assessed separately. Immunological assays may  consist of interferon- gamma ELISPOT, interferon -gamma 
production as determined by ELISA, 4 -1BB upregulation, and or intracellular 
cytokine production as described previously ( 30
). 
HPV detection and genotyping  
Testing will be performed by Dr. Hinrichs’ laboratory using PCR-based type- specific 
HPV detection and quantification assays ( 30). 
5.1.4 Co-Enrollment on 16C0061 / Biobanking 
Samples from patients may be transferred to protocol 16C0061 for biobanking of specimens if 
the patient has consented to that study.   
5.1.5 Sample Storage, Tracking and Disposition 
5.1.5.1 Storage/Tracking in the Preclinical Development and Clinical Monitoring Facility 
(PDCMF)  
• Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system .  Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be 
followed.  Samples will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if required . 
• Samples will be archived by the ETIB Preclinical Development and Clinical Monitoring Facility (PDCMF). All data associated with archived clinical research samples is entered into LabMatrix . Access to this folder is limited to PDCMF staff and ETIB clinical staff, 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 34 
 requiring individual login and password. All staff in the PDCMF laboratory receives 
annually updated NIH/CIT training and maintains standards of computer security. 
• The data recorded for each sample includes the patient ID, trial name/protocol number, date drawn, treatment cycle/post -transplant time point, cell source (e.g. peripheral blood, 
lymph apheresis, mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, marrow, urine, skin or oral biopsy) as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics that correla te treatment 
outcomes and therapies with the samples can be obtained only through the NCI/ETIB clinical records. As of January 2007, all newly received samples receive a unique bar code number, which is included in the sample record in the PDCMF database. Only this bar code is recorded on the sample vial and the vials will not be traceable back to patients without authorized access to the PDCMF database. All non-coded samples previously archived will be stripped of identifiers prior to distribution for any use other than as a primary objective of the protocol under which they were collected. 
• Samples are stored in locked freezers. All samples will be labeled solely with a bar code (which includes the date, and serially determined individual sample identifier) . The key 
will be available to a restricted number of ETIB investigators and associate investigators on the protocol. Coded samples will be stored frozen at -20°, -80° or liquid nitrogen vapor phase according to the stability requirements under the restricted control of the PDCM Facility of ETIB.  
• Access to samples from a protocol for research purposes will be by permission of the Principal Investigator of that protocol in order to be used (1) for research purposes associated with protocol objectives for whi ch the samples were collected, or (2) for a new 
research activity following submission and IRB approval of a new protocol and consent, or (3) for use only as unlinked or coded samples under the OHSRP Exemption Form guidelines stipulating that the activity is exempt from IRB review. Unused samples must be returned to the PDCMF laboratory. 
• Samples, and associated data, will be stored permanently unless the patient withdraws consent. If researchers have samples remaining once they have completed all studies associated with the protocol, they must be returned to the PDCMF laboratory. 
• These freezers are located onsite at the PDCMF laboratory (12C216) or in ETIB common 
equipment space (CRC/3 -3273). 
5.1.5.2 Hinrichs laboratory 
• Samples may be transferred from Preclinical Development and Clinical Monitoring 
Facility  to the Hinrichs laboratory for the research studies indicated in 5.1.3. 
• Samples transferred to the Hinrichs laboratory will be barcoded and tracked with LabMatrix.  
• Laboratory research data will be stored on the NCI secure server in the Hinrichs laboratory folder with secure access by laboratory personnel only. 
5.1.5.3 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction  
• Once research objectives for the protocol are achieved, researchers can request access to remaining samples, providing they have both approval of the Principal Investigator of the original protocol under which the samples or data were collected and either an IRB 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 35 
 approved protocol and patient consent or the OHSRP Exemption Form stipulating that 
the activity is exempt from IRB review.  
• The PDCMF staff will report to the Principal Investigators any destroyed samples, if samples become unsalvageable because of environmental factors (ex. broken freezer or lack of dry ice in a shipping container), lost in transit between facilities or misplaced by a researcher.  
• The PI will record any loss or unanticipated destruction of sample s as a deviation. 
Reports will be made per the requirements of section 7.2. 
6 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION  
6.1 D
ATA COLLECTION  
The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into the C3D electronic system and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness. The principal investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted data manager will assist with the data management efforts. All  data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be kept in secure 
network drives or in approved alternative sites that comply with NIH security standards. Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant. 
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA and NIH Intramural 
Records Retention Schedule as applicable.  Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach  in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred  this will be reported expeditiously per 
requirements in section 7.2.1.  6.1.1 Adverse event recording 
• Grade 1 adverse events will not be recorded.  
• Grade 2 adverse events that will be recorded:  
a. Unexpected events that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the 
research.  
b. Expected events that are probably or definitely related to the study interventions will be record only for the first year.  
c. Any serious events that are deemed clinically significant by the PI 
Note: Grade 2 adverse events that are clearly attributable to surgery /procedure will not 
be recorded.  
• Adverse Events that occur during the follow-up period will only be recorded if they are 
considered related to the M7824. 
• All grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse events will be recorded regardless of attribution. 
• All adverse events are recorded in the medical record.  
All adverse events, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event.

 Document AEs from the first administration of the study therapy, Study Day 1, through 42 days 
after the study therapy was last administered.  Beyond 42 days after the last administration, only adverse events which are serious and related to the study intervention need to be recorded. 
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following: 
• Results in discontinuation from the study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeu tic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospitalization.  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact

6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Disease stage and response will be determined  by flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and/or 
tracheoscopy  using the Derkay staging system if the patient does not have pulmonary disease 
and/or by imaging if the patient has pulmonary disease ( 6). The Derkay staging system has been 
validated with a high degree of inter- rater reliability  (31). It incorporates an objective score 
based on the number of sites and bulkiness of papil lomas  within the pharynx, larynx and trachea 
and a subjective score determined by voice and breathing symptoms.  Physical exam and/or 
clinic -based endoscopy will be used to visualize all accessible papillomas and assign an 
objective score using the Derkay  system.  Only lesions that can be visualized by clinic -based 
flexible nasophar yngolaryngoscopy and/or tracheoscopy will be included in the baseline score 
used for assessing treatment response.  This score must be 10 or greater for pa tients to be eligible 
for treatment.  If patients have disease that is better visualized or only visualized with an imaging 
study such as CT scan or MRI then imaging studies will be obtained. Preliminary Derkay scores and response assessment will be determi ned by the endoscopist performing the procedure. Final 
reporting of clinical responses will be based on a blinded review of endoscopic video and or photos by one or more independent otolaryngologists. 
Response and progression from imaging studies will be e valuated in this study using the new 
international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) ( 32
).  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  
If a subject has disease being assessed by imaging for response and refuses clinic- based flexible 
nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and/or tracheoscopy, no Derkay score will be calculated. This will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
6.3.1 Baseline assessment  
• All ac cessible disease will be examined by physical exam and/or endoscopy to establish a 
baseline  
• Only lesions visualized by clinic -based flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and/or 
tracheoscopy  will be  included in the baseline objective Derkay  score  
• Imaging studie s will be performed if appropriate and baseline measurements deter mined 
using RECIST 1.1 criteria 
6.3.2 Definition of measurable disease 
• Any papilloma that can be visualized via clinic -based endoscopy and assigned a score 
using the Derkay  system  
• Any papilloma that can be measured by imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria 
6.3.3 Definition of disease response 
6.3.3.1 Complete Response  (CR)  
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 38 
 All criteria must be met.  
• No evidence of papillomas on physical exam and/or clinic -based flexible 
nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and/or tracheoscopy  
• No evidence of papillomas by exam under anesthesia (sedation or general anesthesia) 
with endoscopy and biopsies 
• Absence of disease by imaging if lesions are assessed by imaging 
6.3.3.2 Partial response (PR)  
Either criterion may be met.  
• Decrease in Derkay  anatomic score of 30 percent or greater  
• Partial tumor response by imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria 
6.3.3.3 Progressive disease (PD)  
Any criterion may be met.  
• Increase in objective Derkay  anatomic score of 50 percent or greater  
• Disease progression by imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria 
• New or worsening symptoms attributable to growth of papillomas or new papillomas 
6.3.3.4 Stable disease  
• Not me eting criteria for CR , PR, or PD 
6.3.4 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

8 SPONSOR SAFETY REPORTING  
8.1 D
EFINITIONS  
8.1.1 Adverse Event   
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a caus al relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2)) 
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following: 
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event (see 8.1.3) 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 41 
 appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
8.1.3 Life-threatening  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life -threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32) 
8.1.4 Severity  
The severity of each Adverse Event will be assessed utilizing the CTCAE version 5.0. 8.1.5 Relationship to Study Product 
All AEs will have their relationship to  study product assessed using the terms:  related or not 
related.   
• Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between th e study product and the adverse event. 
• Not Related  – There is not  a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
product caused the event. 
8.2 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY EVENTS  
AE information collected will include event description, date of onset, assessment of severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product), date of resolution of the event, seriousness and outcome. The assessment of severity and relationship to the study product will be done only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.  AEs occurring during the collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardles s 
of relationship.  AEs will be followed through resolution. 
SAEs will be: 
• Assessed for severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not 
related to study product) by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator or sub-investigator. 
• Recorded on the appropriate SAE report form , the medical record and captured in the 
clinical database. 
• Followed through resolution by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal  investigator or sub-investigator. 
For timeframe of recording adverse events, please refer to section 6.1.  
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP

 42 
 8.3 REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Any AE that meets  protocol-defined serious criteria or meets the definition of Adverse Event of 
Special Interest that require expedited reporting must be submitted immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) to OSRO Safety using the CCR SAE report form. 
All SA E reporting must include the elements described in 8.2. 
SAE reports  will be submitted to the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at:  
OSROSafety@mail.nih.gov
 and to the CCR PI and study coordinator.  CCR SAE report form 
and instructions can be found at: 
https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=157942842 
Following the assessment of the SAE by OSRO, other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by the OSRO Safety  and should be provided as soon as possible. 
8.4 S
AFETY REPORTING CRITERIA TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATORS  
8.4.1 To be sent by OSRO Safety : 
8.4.1.1 Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
Definition: A suspected adve rse reaction to study treatment that is both serious and unexpected. 
The sponsor  must report SUSARs within 2 business days of learning of the event to EMD Serono’s 
parent  company, Merck via Fax: 781-681-2961 or email: gds@merckgroup.com .

8.4.1.3 Pregnancy  
The sponsor must report any pregnancy occurring in a subject treated with the study drug during 
the course of the study. The Investigator shall ensure that the case is followed up to the end of the 
pregnancy and provide all relevant documentation and a final report on the outcome to Merck.  
8.4.1.4 Annual Report 
The sponsor will provide a copy of the FDA Annual Report to EMD Serono/Merck at the time of submission to the FDA. 
8.5 R
EPORTING PREGNANCY  
8.5.1 Maternal  exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of when the Investigator becomes aware of it. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy become known, 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria ( 8.1.2) should be reported as SAEs .

Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 43 
 8.5.2 Paternal exposure 
Male p atients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 60 
days after the last dose of M7824. 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose of M7824 until 60 days after the 
last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 
8.6 R
EGULATORY REPORTING FOR STUDIES CONDUCTED UNDER CCR-S PONSORED IND 
Following notification from the investigator, CCR , the IND sponsor, will report any suspected 
adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  CCR will report an AE as a suspected 
adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, in accordance to 21 CFR Part 312.32.  
All serious events will be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format.  
9 CLINICAL  MONITORING  
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could affect the interpretation of primary  and secondary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6, and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on: 
• Informed consent process 
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability 
• Adverse events monitoring 
• Response assessment.  
The monitoring program also extends to multi- site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by personnel employed by a CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified by training and experience to monitor the progress of clinical trials. Personnel monitoring this study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.   
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS    
10.1 S
TATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
10.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the fraction of patients in each cohort who have a complete 
response.   
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 44 
 10.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoint is the fraction of patients in each cohort who have a partial 
response.  
10.1.3 Sample Size Determination  
Patients will be enrolled into one of two cohorts according to whether they are checkpoint 
inhibitor naïve or have RRP disease which is refractory to checkpoint inhibition. In each of the two cohorts, the trial will be conducted using a Simon minimax two-stage design; the objective is to rule out a 5% complete response rate (p0=0.05) and target a 20% complete response rate (p1=0.20).   
With amendment D, cohort 2 will be closed to further enrollment.  The design will use alpha=0.10 (10% chance of accepting a poor agent) and beta=0.20 
(corresponding to 80% power --and 20% chance of incorrectly rejecting a promising agent). T he 
first stage of accrual will consist of 12 evaluable patients. If 0/12 has a complete clinical response, then no further patients would be enrolled to that cohort. Should 1 or more patients in the first 12 have a complete response, then accrual would continue until a total of 21 evaluable patients have enrolled in that cohort. If there are 1 to 2 complete responses in 21 evaluable patients in a cohort, this would be considered unacceptably low, while if 3 or more evaluable patients have complete responses in 21 patients in a cohort (14.3%), then the results will be considered sufficiently promising for further evaluation in that cohort. Under the null hypothesis (5% complete response rate) , the probability of early termination is 54.0%.  
It is anticipated that up to 1 patient per month may enroll onto this trial; thus, 2 to 3 years may be required to complete accrual. The trial would require up to 21 total evaluable patients  in cohort 
1; the accrual ceiling will be set at 26 patients to allow for a small number of in evaluable patients  
as well as to accommodate the 2 subjects enrolled in cohort 2 prior to its closure. 
10.1.4 Populations for Analysis 
Modified intention to treat: all patients who rece ive at least one dose of the agent will be 
included in the statistical analyses performed.  
10.2 S
TATISTICAL ANALYSES  
10.2.1 General Approach  
Separately by cohort, the proportion of evaluable patients who experience a CR will be reported 
along with a confidence interval; the proportion of patients who experience a PR will also be reported along with a confidence interval. 
10.2.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
In each of the two cohorts, the fraction of evaluable patients who experience a complete response 
will be d etermined and this fraction will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval. 
10.2.3 Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
In each of the two cohorts, the fraction of evaluable patients who experience a partial response will be determined and this fra ction will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval. 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 45 
 10.2.4 Safety Analyses  
Safety of the agent will be assessed by determining the grade of adverse events noted in each 
patient, and reporting the fraction with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events. Safety data will be presented in summaries, overall and by cohort. The safety data will consist of the reporting of all adverse events, and may also include reporting vital signs, physical examination data, and laboratory safety data. 
10.2.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Limited demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients will be reported.  
10.2.6 Planned Interim Analyses 
None will be performed. 10.2.7 Subgroup Analyses 
Results will be reported according to the cohort in which the patient was enrolled. 10.2.8 Tabulation of Individual Participant Data  
No individual participant data is intended to be reported. 10.2.9 Exploratory analyses 
Exploratory analyses may include the following: 
• Evaluation of PD-L1 and/or TGF- β expression as a potential biomarker of response by 
comparing levels of their expression between responders (PR +CR) and non-responders, 
separately within each cohort, using an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test 
• Evaluation of HPV type as a potential biomarker of response by determining if the distribution of responders vs. non-responders varies by HPV type using either Fisher’s exact test or Mehta’s modification to Fisher’s exact test, depending on the number of categories of HPV type being evaluated (2 vs. 3) 
• Descriptive analyses of induction of HPV -specific T cell responses  
• Descriptive analysis of the clearance of HPV infecti on from normal appearing mucosa  
• Determination of the effect of treatment with M7824 on Derkay and Voice Handicap 
Index -10 scores relative to pre-treatment levels using paired tests such as a Wilcoxon 
signed rank test 
• Determination of the duration of clinical responses to M7824 beginning at the date that a 
clinical response has been identified , using the Kaplan- Meier method

 12 HUMAN SUBJECTS  PROTECTIONS  
12.1 RATIONALE FOR SUBJECT SELECTION  
The patients to be entered in this protocol have RRP involving multiple anatomic sites and 
requiring repeated procedures for disease control. There is no curative therapy for these patients and their disease causes substantial morbidity and occasional mortality. Subjects from both genders and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria.  To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in disease response would be expected in one group compared to another.  Efforts will be made to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck bet ween patient 
safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand.  If differences in outcome that correlate to gender or to ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a follow-up study may be written to investigate those differences more fully.  
There is no effective systemic therapy for patients with RRP. 
RRP  causes deat h by airway compromise, mass effect in the lungs, and transformation into 
invasive cancer.  
12.2 S
TRATEGIES /PROCEDURES FOR RECRUITMENT  
Patients for this protocol will be recruited via standard CCR mechanisms as well as various 
advertising venues.  All advertisem ents, letters and other recruitment efforts will be submitted to 
the IRB for approval prior to their implementation.   
12.3 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of M7824 in patients 
<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.    
12.4 P
ARTICIPATION OF PREGNANT WOMEN  
Based on its mechan ism of action and data from animal studies, M7824 can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Human IgG 1 is known to cross the placental barrier 
and M7824 is an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG 1); therefore, M7824 has the potential to be 
transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Given these risks, pregnant women will be excluded from this study and patients of both genders must be willing to practice contraception throughout M7824 treatment and for at least 120 days after M7824 treatment . 
12.5 E
VALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The experimental treatment has a chance to provide clinical benefit though this is unknown. The safety profile of M7824 has been established in treatment of over 500 patients. The risks are 
well-characterized and the toxicities are generally reversible. RRP carries the risk of repeated 
procedures to control the disease and  the potential for airway compromise, lung compression and 
infection, and transformation to invasive cancer. If this study has a positive outcome it will provide benefit to not only the patients on the study but also to future patients. This study may 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 47 
 also contribute to our knowledge of the mechanism of action of M7824 and the biology or RRP 
that will help to advance treatment of RRP and other diseases.  
12.5.1 Summary of risks and potential benefits 
This clinical trial is being performed to evaluate M7824 for RRP. Only patients with a substantial disease burden (Derkay anatomic score of 10 or greater) that requires repeated endoscopic interventions (two or more procedures in the last 12 months) will be eligible for treatment. While the vast majority of patients with RRP experience an acceptable level of disease control with infrequent surgical debulking, a small subset of patients have very aggressive disease that requires frequent operative intervention, carries the risk of airway obstruction and the need for a tracheostomy, and affects their voice and breathing to a degree that negatively impacts their quality of life. The inclusion criteria for this study captures these 5-10% of patients 
most severely affected. Patients with disease that has not met this level of severity will not be subjected to the risks of treatment.  The primary protocol risks are the toxicities of M7824. There may be add itional risks of treatment that are specific to RRP such as swelling or progression of 
papillomas that may lead to worsening symptoms. In addition, there are risks from the general anesthesia and procedures to stage and monitor the disease. General anesthesia will be employed during an initial evaluation to stage the disease, confirm the diagnosis, and debulk papillomas that pose an undue safety risk. It will be used again two weeks after the initiation of treatment at which time the airway will be assessed  for safety. A final procedure under anesthesia will be 
performed at the completion of treatment to remove residual papillomas if they are present. Rare but serious complications can occur with general anesthesia including cardiopulmonary compromise, stroke, and death. In this protocol they are offset substantially by the important safety information related to airway patency, extent of disease, and in some cases surgical removal of disease that is gained by these procedures.  
12.5.2 Study drug risks 
The risks associated with the study product are discussed in Section 11.1.3. 12.5.3 Exam under anesthesia and biopsy r isks 
Exam under anesthesia (EUA) is associated with the risk of sedation or general anesthesia. 
Complications of general anesthesia are rare. Serious risks include allergic reaction to a drug, loss of airway control and ventilation, and cardiovascular complications such as hypotension, dysrhythmia, or myocardial infarction, and neurological complications such as stroke or brain damage. The risks associated wi th biopsies are pain and bleeding at the biopsy site. Rarely, there 
is a risk of infection at the biopsy site. The anesthesia and biopsies of the initial evaluation have the benefit of confirming the diagnosis and the extent of the disease, and permitting debulking of disease that poses a major airway risk. Similarly, the anesthesia and biopsies at the completion of treatment will either confirm a complete response or will be performed in association with papilloma debulking according to standard of care therapy.  
12.5.4 Risks associated with blood sampling 
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting. 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 48 
 12.5.5 Risks associated with leukapheresis  
Risks may involve bleeding at the apheresis site and lightheadedness. Decrease in blood pressure 
is considered a less common risk. 
12.5.6 Risks associated with intravenous catheter 
12.5.7 The risks of IV insertion include temporary pain and bleeding or bruising at the site 
where the IV enters the skin.  In placing the IV, there is a small chance of f luid leaking 
into the tissue surrounding the IV and infection, which may cause some swelling and discomfort. Rarely, the IV site may become infected, which might require treatment with antibiotics. Risks associated with flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy 
Complications are very uncommon; but may include tearing, gagging, coughing, and, less frequently, nose bleeding due to the scope being passed through the nose. 
12.6 C
ONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
The informed consent document will be provided to the participant for review prior to 
consenting.  A designated study investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study. 
The initial consent process as well as re -consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms) per discretion of the 
designated study investigator and with the agreement of the participant.  Whether in person or remote, the privacy of the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant, when in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted remotely, the participant will be informed of the private nature of the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.    
13 REGULATORY AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS   
13.1 S
TUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to <study participants, investigator, funding agency, the Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) sponsor and regulatory authorities>.  If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study par ticipants, the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study participants will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule. 
 Circumstances that may  warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants 
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping    
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020  
 49 
 • Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements 
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable 
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met 
• Determination of futility  
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed, and satisfy the sponsor, IRB and  as applicable,  Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
13.2 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological specimen collection, documentation and completion.  An individualized quality management plan will be developed to describe a site’s quality management. 
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manuf acturing Practices (GMP)).  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and regulatory authorities. 
13.3 C
ONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, such as by the 
pharmaceutical industry, is critical.  Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the design and conduct of this trial.  The study leadership in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute  has established policies and procedures for all study group members to disclose all 
conflicts of interest and will establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.  
13.4 C
ONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY  
Participant  confidentiality  and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, 
their staff, and the sponsor(s). This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participa nts. 
Therefore, t he study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be 
held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or t he data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.  
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020

 The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, repr esentatives of the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), and/or regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and 
records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy re cords for the participant s in this study. The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at the/each clinical site for internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing  IRB, Institutional policies, or 
sponsor requirements. 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 
reporting, will be transmitted to and stored at the NCI CCR. This will not include the 
participant’s contact or identifying information. Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by the clinical site (s) and by NCI CCR research staff will be secured 
and password protected. At the end of the study, all study databases will be archived at the NCI CCR. 
To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality has been  
issued by the National Ins titutes of Health (NIH).  This certificate protects identifiable research

 The liquid formulation has the same composition in terms of excipients, qualitatively and 
quantitatively, except for the addition of water compared with the freeze-dried formulation, 
which was initially used in the ongoing Phase I study (EMR200647-001). Of note, there is no change to the drug substance process. 
For applications in clinical studies, the liquid formulation is diluted directly with 0.9% saline 
solution (sodium chloride injection) supplied in an infusion bag. 
The estimated volumes of delivery are anticipated to be no more than 250 mL, which are 
clinically acceptabl e. Detailed information on infusion preparation and adm inistration are 
provided in the protocol and manual of preparation. 
14.1.1 Mode of Action  
M7824 is a conjugate comprised of avelumab and the soluble extracellular domain of human 
TGF -β receptor II (TGF -βRII). Avelumab  targets the programmed death –ligand 1 (PD -L1). PD-1 
is a negative regulatory receptor expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD-1 to its ligand, PD-L1, results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Avelumab  inhibits 
the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1.  Inhibition of the interaction between PD- 1 and PD-L1 promotes 
immune responses and antigen- specific T -cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-
antigens. The “TGF -β trap” portion of the compound sequesters bioavai lable TGF -β from the 
papilloma microenvironment.  
14.1.2 Source 
M7824 is an investigational agent that will be supplied to the NIH Pharmacy by EMD Serono. 14.1.3 Toxicities  
The important potential risks include hypersensitivity, irAEs/autoimmune disorders, anemia, rash 
with hyperkeratosis/keratoacanthomas/SCC of the skin, embryo- fetal toxicity, and alterations in 
wound healing or repair of tissue damage.  
In addition, after discussion among NCI investigators  on multiple protocols using M7824, 
multiple bleeding events ranging from low grade gingival bleeding and epistaxis to more serious 
hemoptysis, GI bleeding and hematuria have been observed. Some of these events can be attributed to bleeding events related to cancer directly and others bleeding events can be attributed to colitis or cystitis which is a known toxicity of anti- PD-L1 agents including M7824. 
However, there remains the possibility that M7824 may increase the overall risk of bleeding in ways that may not be directly related to direct tumor bleeding or inflammatory bleeding events described with checkpoint inhibitors like M7824. It is hypothesized that this possible increased bleeding risk may be due to TGF beta inhibition which has an effect on angiogenesis ; bleeding 
has also been observed in patients receiving M7824 and may be drug-related (e.g., gum bleeding, nose bleeds, coughing up blood, blood in their urine, or blood in the stool).  Accordingly, patients will b e notified of the same possible risk in the informed consent document for this 
study. 
14.1.4 Preparation  
M7824 drug product must be diluted in 250 mL of 0.45% or 0.9% saline solution (sodium 
chloride injection) supplied in an infusion bag. Detailed information on infusion bags and 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020

 medical devices to be used for the preparation of the dilutions and subsequent administration will 
be provided in the manual of preparation. 
Prior to the preparation of the dilution for final infusion, allow each vial to equilibrate to room 
temperature. Use a disposable syringe equipped with a needle of suitable size to remove a volume of sodium chloride solution to be replaced by M7824 from the infusion bag and discard the removed solution. Use a new disposable syringe equipped with a n eedle of suitable size to 
inject a volume of M7824 drug product identical to the discarded volume of sodium chloride solution into the infusion bag. Gently invert the mixture 10 times. Infusion bags must not be shaken, in order to avoid foaming or excessive shearing of the protein solution. The preparation must be carefully inspected as it should result in a homogeneous looking clear solution, free of visible particles.   
14.1.5 Storage and Stability  
M7824 drug product must be stored at 2°C to 8°C until use, and it must not be frozen. Rough shaking of M7824 product must be avoided. M7824 drug product must be diluted with 0.45% or 0.9% saline solution. It is recommended that the diluted M7824 solution is used immediately.  
14.1.6 Administration procedures 
Please see section 3.2.1. 
14.1.7 Potential Drug Interactions    
No formal drug interaction trials have been conducted with M7824 in humans.

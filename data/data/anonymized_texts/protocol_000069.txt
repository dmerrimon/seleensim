Investigational Product  STS101 ( Dihydroergotamine  nasal powder)  
Active Ingredient  Dihydroergotamine  mesylate  
Protocol Number  STS101 -003 
Title  of Study  An Open -Label, 12 -Month Study to Evaluate the  Safety  and 
Tolerability of STS101 (Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder) in  the 
Acute Treatment of Migraine  
Study center(s)  Approximately  50 US sites  
Objectives  Primary  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of STS101  in the acute 
treatment of migraine attacks over 12 months . 
Secondary  
• To describe the efficacy of STS101 in the acute treatment of 
migraine attacks  over 12 months . 
Methodology  This study  will be a multi -center, multiple dose (PRN), open -label, 
12-month study in approximately 480 subjects with migraine (ages 
18 to 65 years).  After establishing eligibility, the study participants 
will use STS101 (DHE nasal powder) on a PRN basis to treat migraine  
attacks for 12 months.  Study participants will be able to use up to 
2 doses of STS101 to treat a single migraine attack within 24 hours 
and can use up to 12 doses of STS101 per month for 12 months.  
Subjects of the original cohort (enrolled before June 30, 2021) will 
be offered to continue use of study medication for another 6 months 
after the completion of the original 12-month period.  Only s afety 
data will be collected during this addtioan al period.  
The study participants will document the pain severity of their migraine attacks , presence and severity of symptoms (photophobia,  
phonophobia, nausea) and functionality status over the 48- hour period 
after study drug administration. Specifically, headache  pain severity 
data and symptom presence will be collected at the onset of the 
migraine attack , immediately before drug administration (time 0), 30 
and 60 minutes, 2, 4, 24, and 48 hours after study drug administration.  
Migraine attacks  not treated with study medication will also be 
documented.  Use of rescue medication is allowed, but triptans or 
other DHE products as rescue medications should be avoided for 24 hours after study drug administration  (24 hours after the second 
dose if a repeat dose of STS101 is administered).  
Adverse events, nasal  and physical examination data, safety 
laboratory data,  vital sign data and ECGs will be recorded to describe  
the tolerability and safety of STS101.  Additionally, subjective and 
objective nasal symptom assessments and the Smell Identification

Evaluation Parameters (page 49); Section 8.1 Sample Size Determination (page 57); 
Appendix A Schedule of Evaluations (pages 67 -68) 
Allow subjects of the original cohort ( enrolled and Visit 2 date before June 30, 2021) to continue 
study for another 6 months after completion of 12- month study.  
Rationale:  
Satsuma would like to collect addtional safety data for up to 18 months. Moreover, 12- month 
data in at least 50 subjects using the second generation STS101 devic e on average 2  times per 
month may be required by the FDA for approval. Subjects of the original cohort who  already 
switched to the second generation device before June 20, 2021 have a high likelihood of 
providing that data in time for the STS101 NDA.

Number of enrolled subjects changed from 300 to 480.  
Rationale:  
The FDA requested from Satsuma in December 2018 to provide repeated use data for STS101 for at least 150 subjects using STS101 on average 2 times per month for at least 6 months. Due 
to a highe r than expected drop out rate a 6 six months, and the introduction of a second 
generation device an additional 180 subjects need to be enrolled and assigned study study 
medication.

Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -003, November 24, 2021 (Version 6)  Page 24 of 77 
Confidential  1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1. Introduction  
Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Satsuma ) is developing STS101 (dihydroergotamine nasal powder) , 
a drug- device combination of a dihydroergotamine ( DHE)  mesylate dry powder formulation 
prefilled in a single use delivery device for nasal administration . DHE mesylate  is currently 
indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute 
treatment of cluster headache episodes.  DHE mesylate  is available as a solution for subcutaneous 
(SC), intramuscular (IM), or intravenous (IV) administration and as a nasal spray (IN) 
(D.H.E. 45® Prescribing  Information 2017; Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017) . 
DHE mesylate  is a semi -synthetic der ivative of ergotamine tartrate that has been used effectively 
to treat migraine since 1945 ( Silberstein  2003 ) and was first appro ved in U.S. in 1946. The 
antimigraine activity of DHE mesylate  is likely related to the agonist activity at 5 -HT 1B, 5-HT 1D, 
and 5- HT 1F receptors ( Dahlöf 2012). Additionally, DHE mesylate  can cause vasoconstriction by 
blocking CGRP release,  by stimulating adrenergic α 2A/2c and 5- HT 2A receptors and may inhibit 
neurogenic inflammation in peripheral meningeal tissues and nociceptive neuronal transmission 
centrally in the trigeminal nucleus ca udalis ( Burstein 2004; Dahlöf 2012; González- Hernández 
2018; Hoskin 1996; Silberstein  2003; ). The DHE mesylate -related side effects of nausea and 
vomiting are likely related to activation of central 5 -HT lA receptors and dopamine D 2 receptors 
(Silberstein  2003).  
DHE mesylate is listed as first- line treatment in migraine treatment guidelines from the American  
Academy of Neu rology ( Marmura 2015 ). The effectiveness of DHE mesylate via intravenous, 
intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal and orally inhaled administ ration routes has been 
demonstrated ( Aurora 2011 ; Carleton 1998 ; Edwards 2001; Gallagher 1996;  Raskin 1986; 
Winne r 1996). In these studies, treatment with DHE mesylate has consistently resulted in 
headache relief in 50 to 70% of the treated patients at 2 hours after administration . 
However, p atient acceptance of DHE mesylate has been limited due to these shortcomings:  
• D.H.E.45® (Injectable DHE mesylate  solution)  
o Inconvenience and side effects of administration by injection  (IV, IM, SC)  
o DHE mesylate -related side effects, especially nausea, which is likely related to rate of 
administration (IV) and C max and has been reported to occur less frequently when 
plasma concentrations remain below 6 -10 ng/mL  (Cook 2009)  
• Migranal® (DHE mesylate  intranasal spray)  
o Inconvenient multi -step procedure of vial opening, spray device -to-vial assembly, and 
priming ( Migranal® Administration  Instructions 2017)  
o Inconvenient administration procedure requiring four 0.125 mL sprays (two  in each 
nostril, repeated  after 15 minutes)  (Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017) and 
Migranal® Administration  Instructions 2017 ) 
STS101 (Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder)  Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -003, November 24, 2021 (Version 6)  Page 25 of 77 
Confidential  o Low and variable bioavailability ( Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017 ; 
Tfelt‑H ansen 2013)  
o Slow onset of action ( Tfelt‑Hansen 2013)  
o Drug run off into the pharynx and out of the nose ( Djupesland 2013)  
o Side effect of bad or altered sense of taste ( Migra nal® Prescribing  Information 2017; 
van der Kuy 1999 ). 
STS101 (DHE nasal powder) is designed and being developed to address the shortcomings of the 
injectable  and intranasal DHE mesylate  formulations: 
• STS101 is designed to be easy and convenient for patients to quickly self -administer 
during a migraine attack.  
• STS101 is rapidly and consistently absorbed with T max, Cmax and AUC values falling 
within ranges that have previously been established to be effective for DHE  mesylate . 
• Consistent with DHE mesylate effectiveness data reported in multiple studies, STS101 
treatment is expected to be effective in early and late treatment of m igraines, in attacks  
with and without allodynia, and to result in high 24 -hour pain -free and low 24- hour 
recurrence rates.  
1.2. STS101 Description  
STS101 is a drug- device combination product consisting of a powder formulation of DHE 
mesylate  prefilled in a sing le use delivery device for intra nasal (IN) administration.  
1.2.1.  STS101 Device 
STS101 will be delivered by a pre -filled single use device, which is a manually operated and air 
driven device specifically designed for IN drug delivery  (Figure  1).

Confidential  1.2.2.  STS101 Powder Formulation  
STS101 is a white to off -white powder formulation containing DHE mesylate , microcrystalline 
cellulose (MCC), hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, HPMC), and mannitol.  
1.2.2.1.  DHE Mesylate Information  
DHE mesylate  is a semi -synthetic derivative of ergotamine tartrate and  is known chemically as  
ergotaman -3´,6´,18- trione,9,10- dihydro- 12´-hydroxy- 2´-methyl -5´-(phenylmethyl) -,(5´α)-
,monomethanesulfonate. Its molecular weight is 679.80 and its empirical formula is 
C34H41N5O8S. The chemical structure is shown in  Figure  2. 
Figure 2. Dihydroergotamine mesylate chemical structure 
 
1.2.3.  DHE Mechanism of Action in the Treatment of Migraine 
The antimigraine activity of DHE is likely related to the agonist activity at 5 -HT 1B, 5-HT 1D, and  
5-HT 1F receptors ( Dahlöf 2012 ). Additionally, DHE can caus e vasoconstriction via blocking 
CGRP release,  by stimulating adrenergic α 2A/2c  and 5 -HT 2A receptors and may inhibit neurogenic 
inflammation in peripheral meningeal tissues and nociceptive neuronal transmission centrally in 
the trigeminal nucleus caudalis ( Burstein 2004 ; Dahlöf 2012;  González- Hernández 2018; 
Hoskin 1996; Silberstein 2003 ). The DHE  mesylate- related side effects of nausea and vomiting 
are likely related to activation of central 5 -HT lA receptors and dopamine D 2 receptors 
(Silberstein  2003).  Because of slow diffusion from the receptor biophase, the effects of  DHE  
mesylate  last far longer than can be expected from plasma concentrations  (Dahlöf 2012; 
Tfelt‑Hansen 2013).  
1.2.4.  STS101 DHE Pharmacokinetics  
In a 2- part, three period,  cross- over Phase 1 study,  15 healthy subjects were dosed with

1.2.5.  DHE Clinical Experience  
Migranal® (DHE mesylate  intranasal liquid) and D.H.E. 45® (DHE mesylate  injectable solution) , 
approved in the United States in 1998 and 1946, respectively, have been prescribed to a large 
number of pa tients with migraine headaches. A detailed summary of human experience with 
marketed DHE mesylate  formulations and other data regarding Migranal and DHE mesylate  
Injectable solution can be found in the STS101 Investigator’s  Brochure.

Confidential  1.2.6.  DHE Mesylate Pregnancy Category  
DHE mesylate  may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no 
adequate studies of DHE mesylate  in human pregnancy, but developmental toxicity has been 
demonstrated in experimental animals. DHE mesylate  possesses oxytocic properties and, 
therefore, should not be administered during pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, 
or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetu s. DHE mesylate  is designated Pregnancy Category X in the U.S  
(D.H.E. 45® Prescribing  Information 2017; Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017) . 
1.3. Summary of Nonclinical Data  
The nonclinical toxicology program for STS101 was designed to supplement the known 
nonclinical studies in support of the general safe use of DHE mesylate . In a GLP 14 -day 
intranasal toxicology study with a 14 -day recovery period conducted in dog, the presumed 
No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of DHE mesylate  dose given to dogs (the most 
sensitive species) was approximately 49- fold more than the planned highest clinical dose of 
STS101 on a dose/weight (mg/kg) basis and 5- fold more based on a normalized nasal cavity 
surface area comparison. The results of the d og 14 -day study support the presumption that the 
STS101 DHE mesylate  formulation yields no new or unexpected significant toxicity at the 
highest feasible concentrations possible. The large safety multiples based on the NOAEL provide 
reassurance that the pr oposed human clinical dosing is reasonable and safe.  The study is 
summarized in detail in the STS101 Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4. Rationale for the S tudy  
In the Phase 1 Study STS101- 001, STS101 showed DHE plasma concentrations and PK 
parameters comparable to t hose previously reported for other DHE mesylate  formulations and 
routes of administration ( Humbert 1996; Schran 1994; Shrewsbury 2008 ). Based on the reported 
clinical efficacy data for these other DHE mesylate  formulations and routes of administration, 
the PK profile of STS101 is assumed to be predict ive of  at least comparable clinical efficacy 
(Aurora 2011; Gallagher 1996; Winner 1996).  
This study is being conducted as part of the clinical development program for STS101 to demonstrate the safety  and tolerability of repeat dose use of STS101 for up to 12 months in the 
treatment of acute migraine attacks  with or without aura . 
1.5. Rationale for D osing Frequency  
The DHE  dose of STS101 in study STS101- 003 (5.2 mg, which is equivalent to 6.0  mg DHE 
mesylate, USP, respectively) is  the dose selected for efficacy and safety evaluation in Phase 3. 
The dosing frequency takes into consideration the following:  
• Plasma Exposure (PK) of DHE when administered as STS101  
• Maximum daily/weekly doses per Prescribing Information for DHE by all routes  
• Toxicology evaluations for systemic and local effects  
STS101 (Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder)  Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -003, November 24, 2021 (Version 6)  Page 29 of 77 
Confidential  The dosing schedule in Study STS101- 003 will allow subjects to administer up to 2 doses of 
STS101 5.2 mg within a 24- hour period and up to 12 doses per month.  
This use frequency is primarily based on the comparison of the plasma concentrations after 
STS101 5.2 mg with those after IV and IM injection of D.H.E 45® solution.  
The table below provides comparison of the dosing frequency and PK data for STS101 5.2 mg 
and IV and IM DHE.

The plasma concentrations and PK parameters after 5.2. mg STS101, specifically C max and AUC , 
fall within boundaries of the PK of the approved injectable (IV, IM &  SC) DHE regimen. 
Specifically, the maximum DHE plasma concentrations after 5.2 mg STS101 were below those for  
1.0 mg DHE mesylate IM in Study STS101- 001 (Cmax of 2175 vs 3368 pg/mL, respectively) and 
well below maximum plasma concentrations reported after  IV DHE mesylate ( Kellerman 2013 ), 
providing a large margin of safety.  
The Phase 1 study,  STS101- 001, did not identify any unexpected adverse events after 
administration of up to 5.2 mg STS101. As expected, most of the adverse events after STS101 
were local ized in the nose, rated as mild, transient, and not considered clinically relevant. The 
low scores i n the subjective nasal symptom assessments and no significant findings in the 
objective  nasal  assessments further demonstrate the local tolerability of STS101. The incidences 
of DHE -related adverse events in the nose and taste sensations for 5.2 mg STS101 are comparable 
to those previously reported for Migranal  (Migranal® Prescribing  Informa tion 2017) . 
In support of repeated dosing, the concentration- time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters 
have been projected. The estimated C max following 2 times 5.2 mg (re -dosed at 2 hours) is 
3060 pg/mL compared to  the observed C max of 2175 pg/mL and 3368  pg/mL, after single doses 
of 5.2 mg STS101 and 1.0 mg IM DHE, respectively (STS101- 001).  
The estimated AUC 0-4h following 2 times 5.2 mg (re -dosed at 2 hours) is 7800 pg*h/mL compared 
to the observed AUC 0-4h (based on mean concentration- time profile) of 4810 and 7214 pg*h/mL 
following single doses of 5.2 mg STS101 and 1.0 mg IM DHE, respectively (STS101- 001 
Clinica l Study Report, 2019 and subsequent simulations ).

Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -003, November 24, 2021 (Version 6)  Page 30 of 77 
Confidential  A total of two 5.2 mg administrations in a 24 -hour period is therefore within the exposures that 
have been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated with the approved injectable DHE product.  
DHE mesylate -related side effects, especially nausea, are unlikely to occur, as peak plasma 
concentrations are expected to not exceed 6000 pg/mL ( Cook et al., 2009 ). 
Additionally, repeated  dosing of STS101 is within the margins of safety as established by a 2 -week  
(i.e. 14 consecutive days) intranasal study in dogs (>20- fold based on mg/kg/day, ~5- fold based 
on DHE plasma AUC, and ~2- fold based on nasal cavity surface exposure; Study FY18- 020b; 
see the Investigator’s Brochure for more details on the nonclinical safety overages). Additionally,  a 
6-month toxicity study in dogs via nasal -only inhalation at doses up to 0.825 mg/kg/day resulted 
in minimal treatment related effects (Armer 2011 ). 
When the total daily and total weekly allowances with approved DHE products and routes of 
administration are compared, the DHE mesylate amount for daily and weekly proposed frequency for STS101 is no greater than for oral DHE dosing (10 mg/day and 70 mg/we ek) 
Dihydergot Prescribing Information, 2011.  
In conclusion, STS101 dosing of up to 2 times 5.2 mg STS101 within 24 hours and up to 12 time s 
5.2 mg per month  is supported by the safety profile of single dosing at the proposed dose levels, 
the projected DHE systemic exposure that is within the range of injectable DHE products with 
repeated dosing, and the repeat dose toxicology NOAELs for systemic and local effects. The total number of doses per month will be limited to 12.

Confidential  3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study will be a multi -center, multiple dose (PRN), open -label, 12 -month study in approximately 
480 subjects with migraine (ages 18 to 65 years). After establishing eligibility, the study participants  
will use STS101 (DHE nasal powder)  on a PRN basis to treat migraine attacks for 12 months. 
Study participants will be able to use up to 2 doses of STS101 to treat a single migraine attack 
within 24 hours and can use up to 12 doses of STS101 per month for 12  months.  Subjects of the 
original cohort (enrolled before June 30, 2021) will be offered to continue use of study medication  
for another 6 months after the completion of the original 12-month period.  Only safety data will 
be collected during this additional 6- month period.  
The study participants will document the pain severity of their migraine attacks , presence and 
severity of  symptoms (photophobia,  phonophobia, nausea) and functionality status over the 
48-hour period after study drug administration. Specifically, headache  pain severity data and 
symptom presence will be collected at the onset of the migraine attack, immediately  before drug 
administration (time 0) , 30 and 60 minutes, 2, 4, 24, and 48 hours  after study drug administration . 
Migraine attacks not treated with study medication will also be documented. Use of rescue 
medication is allowed, but triptans or other DHE products as rescue medications should be avoided for 24  hours after study drug administration (24 hours after the second dose if a repeat 
dose of STS101 is administered) . 
Adverse events, nasal and physical examination data, safety laboratory data, vital sign data and 
ECGs will be recorded to describe  the tolerability and safety of STS101. Additionally, subjective 
and objective nasal symptom assessments and the Smell Identif ication Test (SIT) will be 
documented during the treatment period.  
3.2. Study Procedures Description s 
The following list is a description of the procedures to be completed at screening and during the 
study:  
3.2.1.  Informed Consent  
An Ethics Committee  (EC)/Investigatio nal Review Board  (IRB) -approved informed consent 
form (ICF) must be signed and dated by each study subject prior to any study procedures being performed and a copy must be given to the subject.  Subjects continuing for another 6 months after  
the original 12- month treatment period will need to sign an additional informed consent form.  
3.2.2.  Assignment of Subject Identification Number 
Each subject will be assigned an individual subject identification number. The first three digits will  
identify the s tudy site (ranging from 001 to 999) and last three digits will identify the subject as a 
running number starting with 001. As an example, the first subject entering screening at site  001 
would receive the subject identification number 001- 001, the second s ubject 001- 002 etc.

Confidential  3.2.11.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
A designated central laboratory will perform the hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis and 
diagnostic tests as specified in  Table 4. 
Samples for clinical laboratory tests will be taken at S creening  (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2) , 
Visits 5, 8 -10 and at the Final/early termination visit (Visit 11). In subjects continuing for 
another 6 months after the original 12- month treatment period: clinical laboratory tests will be 
taken at Visits 12 -14. All samples will be collected in accordance with the St udy Laboratory 
Manual and shipped to the designed central laboratory.  
The subjects should be instructed to withhold study medication until the site has confirmed that 
the laboratory test results at Visit 2 meet study eligibility criteria. The serum pregnancy test (HCG) will be performed in all female subjects at Screening (Visit 1) and at the Final/early 
termination visit (Visit 11). The serum pregnancy test (HCG) will be performed at every visit 
(Visit 1 through 11) in women of childbearing potential.  
Labo ratory reports will be reviewed by the investigator and out of range values will be identified 
and may be repeated at the Investigator's  discretion.  The Investigator will determine if any out of 
range values are clinically -significant and require record ing as adverse events (AEs) in the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  All clinically -significant out of range laboratory values 
obtained at the Baselin e Visit or Follow -up visit will be followed until they return to normal or 
become medically stable.

phonophobia and nausea during the treated migraine attack  by these requests:  
For photophobia:  “Do you have sensitivity to light?”  
For phonophobia:  “Do you have sensitivity to sound?”  
For nausea:  “Do you have nausea?”  
For each of the three symptoms, the subject will respond with “Yes” (if symptom present) or “No” (if symptom absent).  
Immediately before study drug administration (time 0) , the study subjects will be prompted to 
declare the most bothersome symptom among the symptoms present by this request: “Please indicate which of the symptoms that you have  at (sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound or 
nausea) bothers you the most  at this time .” 
The presence of the three symptoms will be recorded at the onset of the migraine attack , 
immediately before drug administration (time 0), at 30 and 60 minutes, 2, 4, 24, and 48 hours 
after study drug administration.

7.1. Safety Parameters  
The following evaluations and assessments will be conducted during the course of the study 
(Refer to the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix A). 
7.1.1.  Examinations  
7.1.1.1.  Physical Examinations  
A physical examination will include the following body systems: HEENT, Lymphatic, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, Dermatologic, Musculoskeletal, Neurologic  and Other . 
New physical examination observations that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the AE form.  
7.1.1.2.  Height, Weight, and BMI  
Subjects will be weighed in street clothes after removing coat or jacket and shoes at the Screening  Visit, Baseline visit, and follow -up or early termination visit.  At the S creening  Visit , 
subject height will be measured without shoes.  Subjects will have their BMI calculated using the 
following formula: BMI = weight (kg)/height (m
2). 
7.1.1.3.  Vital Signs

Confidential  Clinically significant findings if found at S creening (Visit 1) or Baseline (Visit 2) may be a 
reason to exclude the subj ect. 
In subjects who report chest related symptoms or adverse events, an ECG (in triplicate) should 
be recorded if symptoms are reported to the site within 48 hours of onset.  
7.1.1.7.  Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale  
The S -STS is a 16 -item scale that assesses the seriousness of suicidality risk using a 5- point 
Likert scale from “not at all” (0) to “extremely” (4) ( Sheehan 2014 ). The S -STS will be 
completed by all subjects at all study visits.  
7.1.2.  Laboratory Assessments  
Central laboratory tests results will be reviewed for any clinically significant abnormalities by a 
qualified physician. Labs can be reviewed by a Physician Assistant ( PA) or Nurse Practitioner 
(NP); however, they should be signed/dated by an MD . If any clinically significant findings are 
present at S creening  (Visit 1) or Baseline (Visit 2) , the subject will be considered a screen failure 
and ineligible for study participation.  
7.1.2.1.  Hematology

Confidential  (CK), CK‑myocardial band (CK - MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH), cardiac troponins (Troponin T; Troponin I), and myoglobin . A blood sample  for analysis 
of DHE plasma concentration should also be drawn.  
7.2. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.”  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintende d sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the  investigational 
product.  Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as adverse events recorded after 
dosing of the investigational product.  
AEs will be recorded as volunteered by the subject or solicited through indirect questioning.  
AE collection will begin a fter the signing of the Informed Consent Form (Visit 1)  and 
continue until the f inal/early termination visit  . 
AEs will be solicited at the times indicated in the schedule of assessments by asking a question 
such as: “Since you were last seen , have you felt unwell or different from usual in any way?”  
AEs may also b e reported spontaneously.  
Each AE should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal laboratory values) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a 
diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be  recorded as an AE(s). Changes in 
laboratory values are only considered to be AEs if they are judged to be clinically significant 
(i.e., if some action or intervention is required or if the Investigator judges the change to be 
beyond the range of normal physiological fluctuation). If abnormal laboratory values are the result of pathology for which there is an overall diagnosis (e.g., increased liver enzymes in 
hepatitis), the diagnosis only should be reported as an AE.  
Any adverse events, signs, and symptom s will be fully recorded on the AE form including date 
of onset, date of resolution, frequency, severity, seriousness, relationship to the drug, treatments 
administered and outcome.  AEs may also be reported spontaneously at any time.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source data  and the CRF . Any ongoing  AEs at the subject’s last 
visit will be followed, until it resolves, stabilizes or returns to baseline levels.  
7.2.1.  AE Relationship to Study Drug 
An AE will be considered ‘related” or “not related” to the use of the investigational product 
based on the criteria listed in  Table 5. Assessment of the causal relationship between any Serious 
Adverse Event (S AE) and study drug administration will be performed by both the Investigator 
and the Sponsor.  If at least one of the parties assesses the event as related, it will be reported 
expeditiously as required to the appropriate authorities.  
STS101 (Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder)  Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -003, November 24, 2021 (Version 6)  Page 55 of 77 
Confidential  Table  5. Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
Related:  There is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by the product under 
investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible causality).  
Individual AE reports will be considered “related” to the use of the product if the “not related” 
criteria are not met.  
Not 
Related:  There is an unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the product and the onset 
of the AE (i.e., the event occurred either before, or too long after administration of the product for it 
to be considered product -related);  
The causal relationship between the product, and the AE is biologically implausible (i.e., death of a 
passenger in an automobile accident);  
There is a clearly more likely alternative explanation for the AE (i.e., typical adverse reaction to a 
concomitant drug and/or typical disease -related event).   
7.2.2.  Assessment of Adverse Event Severity 
Table 6 shows the  guidelines for rating severity of AEs may be used:  
Table  6. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity  
Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; no loss of time from 
normal activities; symptoms would  not require medication or  a medical evaluation; signs and 
symptoms may be transient, disappearing during continued treatment with study medication.  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with or modification of  usual activities.  
Severe:  Incapacitating , with inability or notable impairment in  work or usual activities; signs and symptoms 
may be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation; the study drug may be stopped, and 
treatment for the event may be required.   
7.2.3.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Recording and Reporting 
The Investigator must decide whether each AE meets the definition of a n SAE.  An SAE  is any 
untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death.  
2. Is life -threatening.  
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
4. Resu lts in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6. Is considered medically significant by the Investigator or requires intervention to prevent 
any one of the outcomes above.  
For fatal events, the cause of death is  reported whenever known. If an autopsy was performed, an 
autopsy report should be provided. Death should be reported as the outcome of a specific SAE.  
Life-threatening, in the definition of serious, refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
STS101 (Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder)  Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -003, November 24, 2021 (Version 6)  Page 56 of 77 
Confidential  Reports for hospitalization of elective procedures do not need to be reported as SAEs if there are 
no precipitating signs/symptoms or worsening of the  pre-existing condition that necessitated the 
procedure.  However, SAEs must be reported for any medical complications that prolonged the 
hospitalization.  
Medically significant events are those events considered important in the Inve stigator’s opinion 
that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These will also usually be  considered serious.  
Any SAE will be reported within 24 hours of knowledge by the Investigator . Investigator should 
not delay reporting while waiting for clarification or supporting medical information.  
The Investigator must complete the required informati on fields for SAE documentation and 
reporting in the electronic CRF (AE eCRF and SAE eCRF) and provide any supportive documents  
available (hospital summaries, diagnostic test results, laboratory test results, etc.) . Any subject 
identifying information must be redacted  prior to uploading. The investigator should not wait for 
these supporting documents in order to notify the medical  monitor if doing so would place the 
notification outside the 24- hour window. All SAEs will also be reported on the AE eCRF and 
SAE eCRF  and concomitant medications (CM) administered in association with the serious AE 
will be documented on the CM e CRF.  
For any information not available at the time of the first report that becomes available later, the 
Investigator should add this information to both the source documentation and the initial SAE section of the eCRFs, and provide any additional written document ation to the Safety Group 
immediately or within 1 working day of receipt.  
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for notifying regulatory agencies of SAEs that require reporting as per the governing regulations . 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to report to the relevant IRB/EC in accordance with the 
IRB/EC’s reporting specific reporting requirements for SAEs.  
All SAEs must be followed up until the event is resolved, returns to the baseline condition, or is declared medically stable with no furth er change expected or the subject is lost to follow up.  
SAEs Occurring after the Follow -Up Visit : If an SAE comes to the attention of the 
Investigator after study termination within 30 days of the last dose of study drug(s), and it is considered related to study drug, it must be re corded and followed up in the same way as the 
SAEs occurring during the study.  
Any report of pregnancy identified for any female subject or for a female partner of a male subject should be reported immediately (within 24 hours of being informed) to the medical 
monitor. Pregnancies will be considered ‘events of special interest ’ and will not be captured as 
serious adverse events (SAEs). The Pregnancy Report Form will be utilized to obtain follow -up 
information. Pregnancies will be followed to termination or eight weeks post - delivery for 
determination of resolution to the event.  Subjects who become pregnant during treatment must 
immediately be withdrawn from the study (classified as early termination ).

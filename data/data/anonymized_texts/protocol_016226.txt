NEURO -TTRansform: A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of Eplontersen (Formerly Known as ION -682884, IONIS -
TTR-LRx and AKCEA -TTR-LRx) in Participants With  Hereditary 
Transthyretin -Mediated Amyloid Polyneuropathy  
 
Protocol #: ION-682884 -CS3 
Study dates:  December  2019 to July 2023   
Thank you to the participants who took part in the study, “A Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Eplontersen (Formerly Known as ION -682884, IONIS -TTR-LRx 
and AKCEA -TTR-LRx)”, also known as the NEURO -TTRansform study.  
 
Why was this study done?  
Hereditary transthyretin (hATTR) amyloidosis is an uncommon and not well -known 
disease that gets worse quickly, cannot be reversed and if not treated can be deadly. 
hATTR is caused by changes in a specific gene that makes a protein called 
transthyretin (TTR). Genes are pieces of DNA that provide instructions to make a 
specific type of genetic material called messenger ribonuc leic acid (mRNA), which is 
like a recipe for making proteins in the body. Genetic diseases are passed on from 
parents to children through altered (mutated) genes. In hATTR, these mutated genes 
can lead to unstable TTR proteins that break apart into smaller  parts and can form 
clumps called amyloid fibrils. These clumps build up in various tissues in the body.  
When the build -up happens in nerves (units like wires that send messages between 
the brain and the body), the nerves become damaged. Damaged nerves ca n cause 
problems with movement, loss of feeling (numbness) in the arms and legs 
(sensorimotor neuropathy)  and affect bodily functions like digestion (the process your 
body uses to break down the food you eat into smaller parts) and urination (how your 
body  removes liquid waste; peeing). People have different presentations of hATTR. 
The type of hATTR presentation that affects the nerves, digestion, and urination is 
called hATTR with polyneuropathy (hATTR -PN). Between 10,000 and 50,000 people 
worldwide are su ffering from hATTR -PN. After being diagnosed with hATTR -PN, 
people who are untreated usually live for about 5 to 15 more years.  
 
In this study, researchers looked at a potential new medicine called eplontersen. 
Eplontersen  is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) , a type of medicine  that attaches 
itself to hATTR mRNA . When  eplontersen attaches to th e mRNA  for TTR protein , it 
causes the mRNA to break down. Breaking down mRNA means that less of the 
unstable  protein is made . As a result, the cells  (the smallest unit s of any living thing ; 
the building blocks of life ) in the body make less of the damaging TTR protein , which  

                     ION-682884 -CS3                                                                                                                  Ionis Pharmaceuticals , Inc.

 can be helpful for people  with hATTR -PN to better manage the ir disease. 
Eplontersen combines the ASO part of the medicine  with a substance called 
triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc)  to make a  combined  ASO -GalNA c 
medicine . This ASO -GalNA c combination helps the ASO medicine  get taken up 
better by the liver, which is where the  TTR protein is made before it is  circulate d 
throughout the body. Targeting the GalNAc -ASO to liver cells brings the medicine to 
those cells in the body where TTR protein is created and where it is most needed.  
 
This study helped researchers find out if the medicine  called eplontersen lowered the 
TTR protein , was safe and improved the quality of life for people  with hereditary 
transthyretin -mediated amyloid polyneuropathy (hATTR -PN).

• 64 participants  (38%) enrolled in Europe  
• 78 participants  (46%) enrolled  in South America, Australa sia/Asia   
What happened during the study?  
What did researchers want to know?  
The main goal of the NEURO -TTRansform study  was to see how well eplontersen 
worked  in adult  participants  with hATTR -PN compar ed with participants  who received 
placebo in a previous study  called NEURO -TTR, which compared  inotersen 
treatment against placebo in  participants with  ATTRv -PN. Inotersen is a different 
ASO medicine similar to eplontersen , but is not the same, and is not targeted to liver 
cells. In addition, a small group of participants  were treated with  inoters en until Week 
35 of the study and then switched to receiving eplontersen . A placebo is an inactive 
substance that looks like and is administered as the study medicine  but does not 
actually contain any medicine.  
The main question s researchers wanted to answ er in this study were  the following : 
• Does eplontersen change  the levels of TTR in the blood ? 
• Does eplontersen  help improve the symptoms of nerve damage in adults 
with hATTR -PN? 
To address these question s, participants  were given injections of eplontersen under 
the skin every 4 weeks until the final dose at week 81.  Participants  could receive their 
treatment at the study center or do it at home by themselves  or with the help of a 
caregiver  or home healthcare provider . Regardless of the treatment they received, all 
participants  were required to take vitamin A supplements every day.  
What treatment s were studied?  
• Eplontersen, 45 milligrams (mg), given every 4 weeks as an injection under 
the skin (subcutaneous)  from Day 1 to Week 81. 
• Inotersen, 300 milligrams (mg), given every week as an injection under the 
skin (subcutaneous) from weeks 1 -34 and then eplontersen , 45 mg,  from 
Week 37 to 8 1. 
How was the study done?  
There are many types of clinical studies. This study can be described as follows : 
• Phase 3: This phase  is usually the last phase of clinical research before a new 
medicine  is submitted to government authorities for marketing approval.  A 
study at this phase is used  to confirm the effect of a medicine  (how well it 
works) and learn more about  the medicine ’s safety (side effects from the 
medicine ) and tolerability (side effects  from medicine  after repeated use) . 
• Randomized: Who got eplontersen  versus  inotersen  was decided randomly by 
a computer program.  
                     ION-682884 -CS3                                                                                                                  Ionis Pharmaceuticals , Inc.

 • Open label : A type of research study where both the researchers and the 
participants  know which treatment is being given . 
Before the study began, all participants  were screened (evaluated) to  be sure they 
were a good fit for the study.  
Screening  Period  
• During the screening period, participants provide d their written consent 
(agreement) to how the study would be done ( the stu dy procedures ) and 
under went a review process  to determine whether they were eligible to 
participate  in the  study , including completing  a physical exam, answering 
questions about their medical and disease history, and providing blood and 
urine for samples for laboratory testing.  
• The screening period lasted up to 10  weeks.  
Treatment Period  
• Following the screening period, participants  were randomly assigned  (mean ing 
assigned by chance  by a computer program ) to receive either eplontersen or 
inotersen in a ratio of 6 participants  to receive eplontersen for every 1 person  
to receive inotersen . This arrangement ensure d a balanced assignment of 
participants  to each group.  
• Participants  in the eplontersen group received 45 mg of eplontersen injected 
under the skin once every 4 weeks for up to 81 weeks.  
• Participants  in the inotersen group first received 300 mg of inotersen injected 
under the skin once a week for up to 34 weeks, then swit ched to receiving 
45 mg of eplontersen injected under the skin once every 4 weeks from week 
37 to week 81.  
• Throughout the study, all participants  were given daily vitamin A supplements.  
• The treatment period lasted for 84 weeks ( a little over 1 and a half  years).  
Follow -up Period  
• After ending  their treatment, participants  who were eligible had the option to 
join a long -term extension study (ION -682884 -CS13)  where they would 
continue to receive  eplontersen every 4 weeks . 
• The long-term extension study  allowed  researchers to collect more information 
on the safety and effectiveness  of eplontersen .  
• Participants  who did not move on  to the long-term extension study entered a 
20-week follow -up period  after th e last dose  to monitor for side effects ( safety ). 
 
Throughout the s tudy, all participants  had a minimum of 11 visits to the study site 
starting from Week 1. During these visits, participants  had various tests done , 
including checking platelet  count, kidney function, urine protein levels, and liver 
function. Some participa nts also had extra blood samples taken to assess how the 
medicine  was being  processed by the body.

 What were the results  of the study ? 
Out of the 144 participants who were in the eplontersen  group, 135 (94.4%) reached 
week 66 of the study. Out of the 24 participants in the inotersen group, 20 (83.3%) 
reached week 66.   
The information that was collected (data) showed that eplontersen worked better 
compared to historical placebo for lowering t he amount of TTR protein in the blood. 
The reduction in TTR protein was about 82% for the eplontersen group and about 
11% in the historical placebo group from the NEURO -TTR study. The data also 
showed that nerve damage in participants who received eplonter sen was halted and  
participants  had improved wellbeing (quality of life) when compared with the historical 
placebo group. Nerve damage was measured by the modified neuropathy impairment 
score plus seven (mNIS+7) test and quality of life (QOL) was measured by 
participants completing the Norfolk Quality of Life -Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL -DN) 
questionnaire. The Norfolk QoL -DN includes questions for the person to answer 
about various aspects of their daily life, such as how well they could perform basic 
daily act ivities, the state of their emotional well -being, and their experiences with 
social activities.  
The positive effects  seen in participants  treated with  eplontersen  continued through 
the end of the study . 
 
What  medicine -related side effects  did participants  have during the 
study ? 
A summary of the medicine -related side effects that happened during the study is 
shown below. Not all participants had side effects. Side effects are undesirable 
experience s associated with the use of a medicine .  
A side  effect is called se rious  when it results in  death, is life -threatening,  causes lasting 
problems, or requires  hospital care . 
• Total amount of participants  that participated in the study : 168   
• 140 out of 144 participants  (97%) in the eplontersen group compared with 60 
out of 60 participants  (100%) in the historical placebo group had treatment 
emergent  side effects.  
• 21 out of 144 participants  (15%) in the eplontersen group  compared with 12 out 
of 60 participants  (20%) in the hist orical placebo  group had serious treatment 
emergent  side effects.  
• 8 out of 144 participants  (5%) in the eplontersen group compared with 2 out of 
60 participants  (3%) stopped treatment with study drug  due to  side effects.  
• 3 participants in the eplontersen g roup died during the study.  Their doctors 
considered their deaths to not be due to eplontersen.

a = before the COVID -19 pandemic  
b = no side effect s were  report ed because Vitamin A test results were blinded in the NEURO -TTR study . Blinding means 
keeping certain information secret from either the participants, the researchers, or both - like a blindfold in a game, where you 
cannot see what  is happening.  Blinding helps make sure that the results of the study are as fair and accurate as possible .

summary.  
 
How has this study helped participants  and researchers?  
Overall, researchers learned that participants who received treatment with eplontersen 
showed improvements in their condition. Specifically, participants had significantly 
lower levels of the TTR protein in their blood, their symptoms of hATTR -PN did not 
progress , and they reported improved quality of life compared with those who had 
received a placebo in a previous study.  
Findings  from this study may be used in other studies to learn more about the use of 
eplontersen  in people  with hATTR . 
 
Are there plans for further studies?  
Further c linical studies with eplontersen  are ongoing at this time  that can be helpful for 
other conditions .

Exploratory 
Objectives  Continued  • Change fr om Baseline  in N-terminal pro b -type natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP) in patients with cardiac involvement  
To evaluate the plasma trough and post -treatment concentrations of 
ION-682884 or inotersen in all pati ents, and to evaluate plasma 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in a subset of patients . 
Safety Objectiv es To evaluate safety and tolerability of ION -682884 in hATTR -PN patients, 
in the following measures:  change from Baseline  in platelet count and renal 
function, adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical examination 
findings, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, use 
of concomitant medication, thyroid panel tests, inflammatory panel tests, 
coagu lation tests, and immunogenicity tests . 
Study Design  This is a multicenter, open -label study with historical controls and an active 
reference arm (inotersen).   Approximately 140 patients will be randomized 
6:1 to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of ei ther ION -682884  
once every 4 weeks or inotersen  once a week.  Patients will also 
take daily supplemental doses of the recommended daily allowance of 
vitamin A.  
An interim analysis will be conducted at Week 35.  Primary endpoint (PEP) 
analysis will be performed at Week 66.  
Patients included in the inotersen reference arm will be crossed over to 
ION-682884 at Week 37 after completing the Week 35 assessments.  
All patients will continue dosing with ION -682884 until Week 81 with 
end-of-treatment (EOT) assessments at Week 85, 4 weeks after the last 
dose.   
At Week 35, an interim analysis will be performed in hierarchical order for 
the following 3 efficacy endpoints:  1) serum TTR reduction; 2) mNIS+7; 
3) Norfolk QOL -DN.  
At Week 66, co -primar y endpoints will be :  1) serum TTR reduction; 
2) mNIS+7; 3) Norfolk QOL -DN. 
Following treatment and the EOT assessments, eligible patients may elect to 
enroll in an open -label extension (OLE) study pending study approval by 
the Institutional Review Board/I ndependent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) 
and the appropriate regulatory authorities. All participating patients in the 
OLE study will continue to receive ION -682884 once every 4 weeks.  
Patients not participating in the OLE will enter the 20 -week post -treatment 
evaluation portion of this study after completing the EOT assessments.  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established to review 
safety, tolerability and efficacy data (as needed) collected during this study, 
both individual events and aggregate data.

Statistical Considerations  Sample Size  
The sample size for this study was estimated based on the data from the 
NEURO -TTR clinical trial.   With 140 patients (120 of them dosed with 
ION-682884) and assuming a 10% dropout rate, there would be 
108 evaluable patients treated with ION -682884.   In the NEURO -TTR trial, 
there are 52 evaluable placebo patients.  There would be at least 90%  power 
to detect a 19.6 point difference in the change from Baseline  of the mNIS+7 
score between ION -682884 -treated patients and the NEURO -TTR placebo 
patients, with a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025.  
For the serum TTR percent change from Base line, there would be at least 
95% power to detect a 70.3% difference in the percent change from 
Baseline  between ION -682884 -treated patients and the 
NEURO  TTR -placebo patients, with a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025.   
Week 35 Interim Analysis  
The multip licity will be controlled by using the ranking strategy in the 
following testing sequence:  
• Comparison of percent change from Baseline  to Week 35 in serum 
TTR between ION-682884 and NEURO -TTR Placebo  in the Full 
Analysis Set.  
• Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 35 in the mNIS+7

Statistical 
Considerations  
Continued  The percent change in serum TTR from Baseline  to Week 35 will be analyzed 
using the Mixed Effects Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) model 
adjusted by propensity score weights.  
Week 35 Interim Analysis Continued  
For mNIS+7 and Norfolk QOL -DN, the treatment comparison at Week  35 will 
be based on the ANCOVA model adjusted by propensity score.   Patients with a 
missing mNIS+7 (or Norfolk QOL -DN) at Week  35 will have value multiply 
imputed using an imputation model.  
Week 66 Final Analysis  
The multip licity  for the final analysis will be controlled by using  the ranking 
strategy in the following testing sequence:  
• Co-Primary Endpoint.  Comparison of percent change from Baseline to 
Week 65 in serum TTR between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR Placebo in 
the Full Analysis Set.

• Secondary Endpoint:  Comparison of change from Baseline  in the PCS 
score of SF -36 at Week 65 between ION -682884 or NEURO -TTR Placebo 
in the Full Analysis Set  
• Secondary Endpoint:  Comparison of change from Bas eline to Week  65 in 
the PND between ION-682884 and NEURO -TTR Placebo  in the Full 
Analysis Set.  
• Secondary Endpoint.  Comparison of change from Baseline to Week  65 in 
mBMI between ION-682884 and NEURO -TTR Placebo  in the Full 
Analysis Set  
In the Week  66 Fina l Analysis, the alpha level for this endpoint will be 
determined by the resampling procedure (Westfall and Young 1993 ).  For those 
endpoints that are not tested in the interim analysis, significance level of  0.05 will 
be used.   MMRM model adjusted by propensity score weights will be used for 
the primary and secondary analyses in the Week 66 Final Analysis.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
2.1. Overview of Disease  
2.1.1.  Disease Background  
Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a progressive, irreversible, and fatal disease 
caused by mutations in the gene that codes for transthyretin (TTR).  Single -point gene mutations 
destabilize the normal TTR tetrameric structure, causing its dis sociation into free monomers.   
These monomers misfold and subsequently aggregate into insoluble, extracellular fibril deposits, 
causing cell degeneration and death (Quintas et al. 2001 ; Plante -Bordeneuve and Said 2011 ).  
Accumulation of amyloid deposits in hATTR occur in multiple organ systems, including the 
peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, an d heart.  Due to the multiple organ 
deposition of amyloid, the disease has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations.  However, 
historically, hATTR has been divided into 2 major phenotypes:  hATTR with polyneuropathy 
(hATTR -PN), and hATTR with cardiomyopa thy (hATTR -CM).  
The global prevalence of hATTR -PN has been estimated at approximately 10,000 patients 
(range  5,526 –38,468) (Coelho et al. 2008 ; Schmidt et al. 2018 ).  The main clinical 
manifestations of hATTR -PN is a progressive peripheral sensorimotor and autonomic 
neuropathy (Plant e-Bordeneuve and Said 2011 ).  Symmetrical loss of pain and temperature 
sensitivity  typically begins in the lower extremities, progressing distal to proximal.  Motor 
neuropathy follows within  a few years, which affects ambulatory status (Coutinho et al. 1980 ; 
Sekijima et al. 2009 ; Plante -Bordeneuve and Said 2011 ).  Hereditary ATTR -PN is classified into 
3 stages (Familial  Amyloid Polyneuropathy [FAP] or Coutin ho Stages ) based on ambulatory 
status (Coutinho et al. 1980 ):  Stage 1 does not require assistance with ambulation,  Stage  2 
requires assistance with ambulation, and Stage 3 is wheelchair bound.  This staging system was 
used to classify severity of disease in patients being considered for enr ollment in the pivotal 
study of ISIS 420915 (CS2).  Disease severity can also be assessed using the PND score, which 
is a 5 -stage scoring system (Suhr et al. 1996 ).  Life-threatening autonomic dysfunction develops 
in many patients, affecting the cardiocircul atory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems.  
Symptoms include orthostatic hypotension, which can lead to dizziness, loss of consciousness 
and frequent falls.   Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, severe constipation, alternating 
diarrhea/constipation, fecal incontinence, vomiting, and gastroparesis, all leading to 
progressive  weight loss.   Genito -urinary symptoms, including recurrent urinary tract 
infect ions,  and, in men, erectile dysfunction may be present (Plante -Bordeneuve and Said 2011 ).  
Lifemexpectancy of patients with hATTR -PN is reported to be 5 -12 years after diagnos is 
(Adams et al. 2012 ; Coelho et al. 2018 ).  Patients  typically die due to malnutrition and cachexia, 
renal failure, and cardiac disease (Coelho et al. 2008 ). 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
35  Cardiac involvement has been estimated to occur in 80% of TTR  amyloidosis (Plante -
Bordeneuve and Said 2011 ), manifested by restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure (Castano 
et al. 2015 ), conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias.   Amyloid deposits in the kidney are 
common and can  result in microalbuminuria with progression to renal failure in a subset of 
patients.  
As expected, given the severity of hATTR, there is a significant impact on patients’ and 
caregivers’ quality of life (QOL) (Stewart et al. 2013 ; Gertz 201 7).  Caregivers have moderate to 
high levels of fatigue and spend a significant amount of time caring for patients.  Heredita ry 
ATTR is associated with a substantial disruption in employment rates and work productivity.  
There is also a large mental health burden on both caregivers and patients.  
2.1.2.  Overview of Target – Transthyretin  
The name transthyretin (TTR) is derived from transporter of thyroxine and retinol  and was 
formerly known as prealbumin.   TTR is synthesized primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, 
by the choroid plexus and retina.   A major function of TTR in the plasma is t o transport retinol 
(vitamin A) to tissues and decrease urinary clearance of retinol through its association with 
retinol binding protein  4 (RBP4).  About 70% of total body retinol is stored in the liver and 
mobilized into the blood stream bound to RBP4 (D'Ambrosio et al. 2011 ).  The ratio RBP4:TTR 
in plasma is around 0.3 in healthy individuals, indica ting that most of the circulating TTR 
remains free of RBP4 ligand (Buxbaum and Reixach 2009 ).  Besides transporting the 
retinol -RBP4 complex, TTR also transports ~15%  of plasma thyroxine with most of t he 
thyroxine transported by either thyroxine binding globulin or albumin.  
Recent evidence has suggested that TTR may also have a neuroprotective function in the brain.  
Brain TTR is produced primarily by the choroid plexus and has been proposed to help wi th nerve 
regeneration and to play a protective role in the Alzheimer’s disease (Buxbaum and Reixach 
2009 ; Fleming et al. 2009 ).  It has been demonstrated that mice treated systemically with a 
TTR -specific antisense oligonucleotide  (ASO ) had decreased hepatic TTR mRNA levels and 
serum TTR concentration but did not show changes in the expression of TTR in the choroid 
plexus (Benson et al. 2006 ; Benson et al. 2017 ). 
2.1.3.  Current Therapies  
Current therapeutic strategies to treat hATTR -PN include orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 
or pharmacotherapy by stabilizing the TTR tetramers with Vyndaqel® (tafamidis) or 
off-label  use of diflunisal, or by silencing the TTR protein production with Tegsedi™ (inotersen) 
or Onpattro™ (patisiran) (Coelho et al. 2012 ; Berk et al. 2013 ; Adams et al. 2016 ; Adams, 
Hawkins, et al. 2018 ; Benson et al. 2018 ).  
Because most of the amyloidogenic -mutated TTR is secreted by the liver, OLT results in rapid 
disappearance of mutant TTR protein from the serum.   However, wild -type TTR protein 
continues to be produced by the donor liver and can deposit in the pre -existing amyloid deposits 
in the tissues after transplantation, leading to continual disease progression and, in some cases, 
accelerating heart disease (Yazaki et al. 2000 ; Liepnieks and Benson 2007 ; Yazaki et al. 2007 ; 
Liepnieks et al. 2010 ).  Young er patients with early disease, Val30Met (V30M) mutation, and 
mild symptoms (typically Stage 1) generally experience better outcomes with OLT.   Stage  2 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
36  patients are often not candidates for OLT due to advanced age, cardiac involvement, or other 
health reas ons (Herlenius et al. 2004 ; Stangou and Hawki ns 2004 ). 
Onpattro™ (patisiran) is a double -stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) product which also 
works by inhibiting production of TTR protein; patisiran is approved in the United Sta tes and in 
the European Union for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR in adults.   This drug is 
given intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks after patients are premedicated with high -dose 
dexamethasone.  Tegsedi™ (inotersen) is an ASO drug administered once a week SC 
(Section  2.3.4 ); Tegsedi™ is authorized in the European Union, US and Canada for the treatment 
of Stage 1 or Stage 2 polyne uropathy in adult patients with hATTR -PN.  
Vyndaqel® (tafamidis) which is a TTR stabilizer that works by preventing dissociation of the 
tetramer into amyloid -forming monomers, is indicated for the treatment of hATTR -PN in adult 
patients with Stage 1 polyne uropathy, and is currently approved for use in Europe, Japan, and 
several other countries.  In some countries, tafamidis is also indicated for patients with more 
advanced stages of disease (Stage 2 and/or Stage 3).   For patients with ATTR -CM in the United 
States, Vyndaqel®/Vyndamax™ (tafamidis) have been recently approved for ATTR -CM and have 
been shown to reduce all -cause mortality, and cardiac related hospitalizations due to ATTR.  
Diflunisal is a non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drug  (NSAID ) that also acts as a TTR tetramer 
stabilizer and is not currently approved for the treatment of hATTR .  Off-label use has been 
reported in patients with Stage  1 and Stage  2 disease (Adams et al. 2016 ); however, t he kno wn 
cardiovascular and renal side effects associated with the NSAID drug class may limit the use of 
this drug in older patients with hATTR -PN and concomitant cardiomyopathy and/or renal 
disease.  
Consequently, there continues to be an unmet medical nee d for effective, well -tolerated and 
convenient treatments that do not require additional premedication for patients with hATTR -PN 
worldwide.  
2.2. Therapeutic Rationale  
 
 
It should be 
noted that ASOs are highly charged hydrophilic molecules that do not cross the blood brain 
barrier (Levin et al. 2008 ) and thus systemic treatment with ION -682884 is not predicted to 
decrease levels of TTR in the brain.  
It is predicted that decreasing the amount of liver -derived TTR  protein circulating in the plasma 
by treatment with ION -682884 will result in a decrease in the formation of TTR amyloid fibril 
deposits, and thus slow, halt or even reverse disease progression.  This strategy has been 
validated in the treatment of hATTR -PN patients through  2 recently approved drugs, 
i.e., inotersen (Benson et al. 2018 ) (an unconjugated 2′ -MOE ASO that has the same base 
sequence as ION -682884) and patisiran (Adams, Gonzalez -Duarte, et al. 2018 ). 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

38  2.3.3.  Preclinical Experience  
Detailed information concerning the preclinical studies conducted with ION‑682884  can be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  A summary is included bel ow. 
The human TTR ASO, ISIS 420915 (inotersen), identified from a broad screen of ASOs targeted 
to various regions of the human TTR pre -mRNA, was demonstrated to be potent and efficacious 
in reducing human TTR mRNA expression in the human HCC cell line Hep G2.  
 ION -682884, was found to 
be significantly more potent that the unconjugated parent ASO, ISIS 420915, in inhibiting TTR 
mRNA expression in human hepatocytes in vitro (approximately 51-fold improvement in 
potency, IC 50), with the potential to greatly increase the safety margins.  
The activity of ISIS 420915 has been characterized in both nonhuman primates and genetically  
modified mice.   In human TTR transgenic mice, the ED 50 values fo r human TTR hepatic mRNA 
and plasma protein reductions were 12.0 and 18.6 mg/kg/wk, respectively, following treatment 
with ISIS 420915 for 4 weeks.  Treatment of cynomolgus monkeys with 50 mg/kg/wk 
ISIS 420915 for 12 weeks reduced TTR hepatic mRNA and plas ma protein concentration by 
approximately 80%.  
ION-682884, significantly improved inhibition of human TTR hepatic mRNA and plasma 
protein concentration in human TTR transgenic mice (with 28 -fold and 15 -fold increase in 
potency, ED 50, respectively), as com pared to the unconjugated ASO, which is expected for this 
hepatocyte -expressed target.  Treatment of cynomolgus monkeys for 13 weeks with 
ION-682884 resulted in 60 –70% reduction in TTR hepatic mRNA and plasma 
protein concentration.  
These resul ts using human TTR transgenic mice  strongly support GalNAc -conjugation to 
significantly increase ASO potency in inhibiting hepatic mRNA  and plasma protein with lower 
doses providing the potential for improved safety.  
2.3.4.  Clinical Experience  
Detailed informatio n concerning the clinical stud ies conducted with ION‑682884 , as well as 
description of previous clinical experience with other related 2′ -MOE phosphorothioate 
oligonucleotides , can be found in the Investigator’s B rochure.  A summary is included below.  
ION 682884 has been evaluated in a Phase 1, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial 
(ION -682884 -CS1) in healthy volunteers to assess the tolerability, safety, PK, and PD of 
multiple and single doses of ION -682884.  Four (4) cohorts of healthy volunteers were dosed at 
45 mg once every 4 weeks for 4 months (Cohort A), 60 mg once every 4 weeks for 4 months 
(Cohort E), 90 mg once every 4 weeks for 4 months (Cohort B), and 120 mg as a single dose 
(Cohort C).  Twelve  (12) subjects were planned for each cohort, randomized 10:2 active drug to 
placebo, although for Cohort C only 11 subjects were enrolled (randomized 9:2).  The mean 
percent change from Baseline in serum TTR in the multiple -dose cohorts at Day 99, 2 weeks 
after the fourth and last once -monthly dose, was -85.7 with 45 mg, -90.5 with 60 mg, 
and -93.8 with 90 mg.  There were no serious adverse events (SAE), and no decrease in platelet 
count or renal function in the study.  However, ALT increase was seen (< 3 × ULN) in some of 
the subjects in the 90 mg cohort.  A clinical dosing regimen  administered once monthly 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

42  2.5. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
2.5.1.  Benefit Assessment  
Administration of ION -682884 to patients may reduce the levels of mutated and wild -type TTR 
protein secreted by the liver, the primary source of TTR production and a primary o rgan for 
GalNAc -conjugated ASO distribution after systemic delivery.  By decreasi ng the amount of 
liver-derived TTR protein circulating in the plasma, ION -682884 treatment should result in 
decreased formation of TTR amyloid fibril deposits and thus slow or  halt disease progression, as 
measured by specific outcome measures, including mN IS+7, Norfolk -QOL -DN, R -ODS, NSC, 
SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, and COMPASS -31. 
• mNIS+7 is a modified version of the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) that has been 
used in two clinical trials in patients with hATTR -PN (Adams, Gonzalez -Duarte, et al. 
2018 ; Benson et al. 2018 ).  mNIS+7is a combination of a) NIS (motor, reflexes and 
sensory neurological evaluation), b) standardized quantitative sensory testing (heat pain 
and touch pressure at multiple body sites), c) composite nerve conduction  score including 
five large fiber neurophysiological attributes, and d) autonomic function measured by the 
heart rate  (HR)  response to deep breathing .  
• Norfolk QOL -DN is included to assess disease specific changes in the patients’ perceived 
QOL .  This inst rument is a neuropathy -specific, 5 -domain tool that has been validated in 
hATTR -PN patients (Vinik et al. 2014 ) and used in multiple pivotal trials for novel 
therapies for ATTR.  
• Rasch -built overall disability scale (R -ODS) is a 24 -item patient -reported outcome 
measure validated to measure activities of daily life in patients with inflammatory 
neuropathies (van Nes et al. 2011 ) and hA TTR -PN (Adams, Gonzalez -Duarte, et al. 
2018 ). 
• Neurop athy Symptom Change (NSC) Score is a questionnaire composed of 38 questions 
that assess the presence and severity of these neuropathy symptoms (including weakness, 
loss of temperature and pain sensation, and manifestations associated with autonomic 
nervous  system dysfunction).  
• SF-36 is a non -disease specific tool to assess health related QOL ; it is composed of 
8 multi -item scales (35 items) assessing physical function (10 items), role limitations due 
to physical health problems (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health (5 items), 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
43  vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role limitations due to emot ional problems 
(3 items) and emotional well -being (5 items).  These 8 scales can be aggregated into 
2 summary measures:   Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Summary scores.  
The 36th item, which asks about health change, is not included in the scale or summary 
scores.   
• EQ-5D-5L (The EuroQol  Group ) is a standardized quality of life assess ment , used as a 
measure of health outcome , and  composed of 5 question s in the following domains: 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  
• COMPASS -31 (Sletten et al. 2012 ) is a questionnaire com posed of 31 clinically selected 
questions evaluating 6 autonomic domains (orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, 
secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder, and pupillomotor).   
• PGIC is a global index that evaluates all aspects of patients' health and assesses if  there 
has been an improvement or decline in clinical status; and PGIS  is a global index that is 
used to rate the severity of a specific condition.  
Many patients with hATTR -PN also have hATTR -CM.  There is no widely -accepted method 
for measuring progression of cardiac disease in hATTR -CM.  However, recent studies have 
shown that strain imaging with echocardiography or MRI can detect changes within a 1 -year 
time frame (Falk 2011 ; Benson et al. 2017 ).  In addition, the cardiac biomarker NT -proB NP has 
been shown to be elevated in patients with cardiac amyloidosis due to amyloid light amyloidosis  
(AL Amyloidosis ) and to decline as cardiac function improves following removal of the amyloid 
forming light chain protein with chemotherapy (Palladini et al. 2006 ).  
2.5.2.  Risk Assessment  
The known potential risks to study participants associated with ION -682884 are detailed in the 
Guidance to Investigator section of the Investigator’s Brochure.  Study associated potential 
safety considerations include thrombocyto penia, occurrence of glomerulonephritis, and vitamin 
A deficiency.  
Thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis are potential considerations based on clinical findings 
with inotersen, the unconjugated form of ION -682884,   
This dose is 27 -fold higher exposure compared to the proposed dose of ION -682884 in the 
current study study.  Frequent platelet , urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR ), renal and hepatic 
function monitoring as well as stopping rules will be implemented in thi s study (see Section s 8.5 
and 8.6).  If the platelet result is unavailable (e.g., due to hemolysis, clumping, etc.) it must be 
repeated and reviewed prior to dosing during the Treatment Period.  
Because TTR binds the retinol -RBP4 complex and prevents its excretion by the kidney, 
decreased plasma TTR concentration result in decreased circulating levels of both RBP4 and 
retinol.  This has been shown with the naturally occurring TTR Ile84 mutation that disrupts the 
TTR -RBP4 -retino l complex and results in low plasma levels of retinol (Waits et al. 1995 ).  
Prolonged reduction of circulating retinol could result in impaired delivery of retinol to 
peripheral tissues and consequent signs and symptoms of vitamin A def iciency such as night 
blindness, xerophthalmia or retinopathy.  However, chylomicrons are believed to provide an 
alternative route of delivery of retinyl esters to peripheral tissues (Wei et al. 1995 ) and 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
44  chylomicron -delivered retinyl will not be affected by treatment with ION -682884.   Indeed, 
preclinical studies utilizing TTR null mice have shown that although the mice have only 5 –7% of 
circulating retin ol and RBP4 levels compared to wild -type mice, they are viable and fertile, and 
do not show any observable symptoms of vitamin A deficiency (Episkopou et al. 1993 ; Wei et al. 
1995 ).  In addition, the levels of retinol within tissu es such as the liver, kidney, testis and eye 
were similar in the TTR null mouse compared with wild -type controls (Wei et al. 1995 ).  
Furthermore, the re tinal anatomy and function in these mice has been examined in detail with 
little effect found on the retinal structure or function (Bui et al. 2001 ).  In addition, twins have 
been reported in the literature that have  a genetic mutation in RBP4 that causes their RBP4 
protein levels to be below the lower limit of quantification and also results in very low plasma 
retinol levels (Biesalski et al. 1999 ).  In addition, mutations in the RBP4 gene have been 
identified in 2 teenage siblings with no detectable serum RBP and retinol levels less than 20% 
normal (Biesalski et al. 1999 ; Seeliger et al. 1999 ).  Despite the low retinol, they have normal 
retinyl esters levels, normal absorption of fat and vitamin A after a meal challenge, and  they have 
mild night blindness and a modest retinal dystrophy but no pronounced effects on growth or 
other physiologic functions that are normally affected during vitamin A deficiency.  Taken 
together these findings imply that RBP4 is not essential for ma intaining adequate tissue retinol 
levels.   In addition, no imbalance of vitamin A deficiency was found in the NEURO -TTR trial 
after treatment with ISIS 420915, the unconjugated form of ION -682884, compared to 
placebo -treated patients.  Nonetheless, to addr ess the potential for impaired retinol delivery to 
tissues, in this study all patients will be required to take oral supplementation of the 
recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin A (approximately 3000 IU vitamin A per day).  
In addition, an ocular qu estionnaires to screen for vitamin A deficiency will be performed 
periodically during the trial.  
2.5.3.  Overall Assessment of Benefit:Risk  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to patients participating in this study, 
including frequent safety monitoring and supplementation with vitamin A, the potential risks 
identified in association with ION‑682884  are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be 
afforded to patients with hATTR -PN. 
3. EXPERIMENTAL P LAN  
3.1. Study Design  
This is a Phase 3 multicenter, open -label, randomized study of ION -682884  (eplontersen)  in 
Stage 1 and Stage  2 hATTR -PN patients with a NIS of 10 to 130, with a concurrent reference 
arm of inotersen.  Approximately 140 patients will be randomized 6:1 (ION -682884:inotersen) to 
receive  ION -682884 SC once every 4 weeks  or inotersen  SC once 
every week   Patients enrolled in the ION -682884 arm will be compared to patients 
enrolled in the placebo -cohort group  in the ISIS  420915 -CS2 (NEURO -TTR).  An interim 
analysis will be conducted at Week 35 with primary efficacy analysis at Week 66.  As both 
analyses will utilize comparisons to a control group external to the current study, the concurrent 
inotersen referenc e arm (n  = 20) is intended to ensure that no gross differences in patient 
population and response exist between the NEURO -TTR and the current study.  Patients in the 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
45  reference arm (inotersen) will be crossed over to ION -682884 once they complete 
Week  35 assessments.   These patients will start ION -682884 at Week 37.  All patients will 
continue dosing with ION -682884 until Week 81 with end -of-treatment (EOT) assessments at 
Week 85, 4  weeks after the last dose.  
For patients randomized to ION -682884, attempts will be made to mirror NEURO -TTR 
distribution of patients according to disease stage (i.e., Stage 1 -FAP vs. Stage 2 -FAP).  
Approximately 28 patients at selected sites (~22 on ION -682884 and ~6 on inotersen) will be 
enrolled in a PK subgroup and will receive  additional sampling for PK as specified in the 
Schedule of Procedures (Appendix  A).  
Following treatment and the EOT assessments, eligible patients ma y elect to enroll in an OLE 
study pending study approval by the IRB/IEC and the appropriate regulatory authorities.  All 
participating patients in the OLE study will continue to receive ION -682884 once every 4  weeks.  
Patients not participating in the OLE will enter the 20 -week post -treatment evaluation portion of 
this study after completing the EOT assessments.  
3.2. Number of Study Center s 
This study will be conducted at multiple centers worldwide.  
3.3. Number of Patients  
Approximately 140 patients will be randomized 6:1 (ION -682884:inotersen) to receive  
ION-682884 SC once every 4 weeks or inotersen  SC once weekly.  For details about the 
rationale followed to determine the number of patients required see Section 10.2.  
3.4. Overall Study Duration and Follow -up 
This study will consist of the following periods:  
• A ≤ 10-week Screening Period and Baseline/ Day 1 Assessment s 
• A 84-week Treatment Period   
• A 20 -week Post-Treatment Evaluation Period /or enrollment into OLE  study  
Please refer to the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix  A.  Patients may be required to attend 
additional visits for monitoring of AE or abnormal investigation results.   The frequency of 
additional monitoring will be determined after consultation between the Study Medical Monitor 
and the Investigator.  
3.4.1.  Screening and Baseline  Assessment  
Patient eligibility for the study will be determined within 10 weeks prior to study entr y.  The 
Baseline  assessments should ideally be conducted after patient eligibility has been determined.  
3.4.2.  Treatment  Period  
The treatment and EOT Efficacy Assessment Period comprise approximately 84 weeks in total.  
Eligible patients will report to the Study  Center  for assessments at regular intervals throughout 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
46  the 80 -week Treatment Period  (Week 1 to Week 81).  During the Treatment Period , ION -682884 
is administered by SC injections every 4 weeks, and inotersen is administered by SC injection 
every week unti l Week 35.   At Week 37, patients in the inotersen arm will be crossed -over to 
ION-682884.  After the Treatment Period  is com plete, patients will report to the Study Center  
during Week 85 for the EOT efficacy assessments.  
3.4.3.  Post-Treatment Evalu ation Period and Long -Term Follow up  
Patients must complete  follow -up visits on Weeks 89, 93, 97, 101 and 105 ; the visits on Weeks 
93 and 105 are mandatory in -clinic visits .  The final study visit will be on Week 105.   
Alternatively, after completion of the EOT Efficacy Assessment Period, eligible patients 
(including patients that initially received inotersen) may elect to enroll in an OLE study where 
they will receive ION -682884 once every 4 weeks, pending study approval by the IRB/IEC and 
appropriate regulatory authority.   In this case, patients will not participate in the Post-Treatment 
Evaluation Period . 
3.5. End-of-Study  
The Primary Completion Date, defined as “the date on which the last participant in a clinical 
study was examined or received an intervention/treat ment to collect final data for the primary 
outcome measures ” is the last patient Week 66 study visit .  
The Study Completion Date is the last patient last visit (Week 105) at the end of the 
Post-treatment Evaluation Period.  
3.6. Data and Safety Monitoring Board   
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be assembled and meet periodically to review 
safety, tolerability and efficacy data collected on ION‑682884  and inotersen, and to review the 
results of the predeter mined interim analysis at Week 35.   Based on its assessment of the safety, 
tolerability and efficacy of ION‑682884  and inotersen, the DSMB will provide recommendations 
to the Sponsor for modifying, stopping , or co ntinuing the study as planned.  Details on the safety 
assessments, frequency of review, meeting schedules and controlled access to data are outlined 
in the DSMB Charter and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   
4. PATIENT ENROLLMENT  
4.1. Screening  
Before patients may be enrolled into the study, the Sponsor or designee requires a copy of the 
Study Center ’s written IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent form,  and all other 
patient facing information and/or recruitment material.  
Patients or  their legally acceptable representatives must sign the consent form before any 
screening tests or assessments are performed.  At the time of consent, the patient will be 
considered enrolled into the study and will be assigned a unique screening number bef ore any 
study procedures, including Screening procedures, are performed.  At the time of randomization, 
patients will be assigned a unique patient identification number.  This number will be used to 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
47  identify the subject throughout the trial and must be use d on all study documentation related to 
that subject.  The screening number and patient identification number must remain constant 
throughout the entire trial.  In the event the subject is re -consented and re -screened the subject 
must be given a new screen ing number.  Screening numbers and patient identification numbers, 
once assigned, will not be re -used.  
4.2. Randomization  
Patients will be randomized  after all Screening assessments have been completed and after the 
Investigator has verified that they are eligi ble per criteria in Section  5.1 Section  5.2.  No patient 
may begin treatment prior to randomization and assignment of a unique patient identification 
number.  
Using an Interactive Voice/Web -Response System (IXRS), eligible patients will be randomized 
6:1 to receive ION -682884 or inotersen, respective ly.  Attempts will be made to mirror the 
NEURO -TTR distribution of patients according to disease stage (i.e., Stage 1 -FAP vs. 
Stage  2-FAP).

6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1. Study Schedule  
All required study procedures are outlined in  Appendix  A, Appendix  B and Appendix  C. 
6.1.1.  Screening  and Baseline Assessments  
Before any study -specific procedures or evaluations are initiated, patients must sign and date the 
informed consent form.   If required, the informed consent  may be administered remotely using 
locally accepted methods.  An  up to 10-week period is given to perform the screening 
evaluations and Baseline s assessments .  An abnormal screening result may be retested if 
Investigator believes and documents that the re sults are artifactual.  An NIS assessment is 
performed at screening to determine patient eligibility only.  This assessment does not include 
the +7 components.  TTR genotyping is only conducted if previous results are not already 
available.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
51  Baseline assessments can be conducted during the 10 -week screening window and should ideally 
be performed after patient eligibility has been determined.  Appendix  A details which Baseline 
assessments should be completed before Study Day 1.   
Laboratory collections can be performed by a home health -care provider instead of in -clinic.  
Biopsy for verification of amyloid deposition is not required as part of the el igibility but can be 
performed per Investigator judgment.  
The study site will record patient’s basic personal details, including name, contact details, 
gender, date of birth, age, and self -reported ethnicity and racial origin (to be used only for 
clinical purposes) , as well as information on each patient’s  medical history, and clinical data 
collected about his/her  participation in the study . 
The 2 mNIS+7 assessments must be performed within 21 days prior to the first dose of 
ION-682884 or inotersen (Day 1) and the second mNIS+7 assessment must be conducted 
≥ 1 day apart from the first assessment.  In addition, every effort should be made to conduct the 
2 assessments < 7 days apart.  If a blood draw is to be performed on a mNIS+7 assessment day, 
they must be performed after the mNIS+7 assessment is complete.  The mNIS+7 assessment 
procedure includes the NIS, sensory and motor nerve conduction testing, quantitative sensory 
testing and measurement of heart -rate variation with breathing.  The NSC score is collect ed 
during the NIS assessment procedure but is analyzed separately.  
6.1.2.  Day 1/Randomization  
During the Day  1 study visit, patients will report to the Study Center for evaluations, 
randomization, and ION‑682884 or inotersen administration (first dosing should be  the last 
procedure of Day 1 study visit).  See Appendix  A for the assessments that should be performed 
on Day 1.   
For a visit where Norfolk QOL -DN is to be administered, it must be the first assessment 
performed at the visit.  Baseline Norfolk QOL -DN can be administered on the same day as the 
first mNIS+7 assessment, but must be performed prior to the mNIS+7 assessment.  
For an individual patient, every effort should be made to ensure the same mNIS+7 evaluator 
performs all of the mNIS+7 assessments th roughout the study.  In addition, the mNIS+7 
evaluator must be insulated from the patient’s general study procedures and knowledge of the 
patient’s AEs.   
6.1.3.  Treatment Period  
During Study Week 1, patients will report to the Study Center  for evaluations and ION -682884 
or inotersen administration on Day 1.   After Week 1, ION -682884 will be administered once 
every 4 weeks  through the end of the Treatment Period.   Inotersen will be administered once 
weekly  up to and including Week 34 at which time patients will tra nsition to every 4 week 
administration of ION -682884 . 
For patients randomized to the ION -682884 treatment arm, there will be a total of 43 visits 
during Weeks 1 - 83 for ION -682884 administration and other study procedures (see Schedule of 
Procedures in Appendix  A).  Eleven of the 43 visits are mandatory in -clinic visits, whereas  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
52  32 visits can be completed either in -clinic, at home by a home health -care provider (if approved 
locally), or by using a local laboratory upon Investigator approval.  
For patients randomized to the inotersen reference arm, there will be a total of 60 visits during 
Weeks 1 -83 for Study Drug administration and other study procedures (see Schedule of 
Procedures in Appendix  A).  Eleven of the 60 visits  are mandatory in -clinic visits, whereas  
49 visits  can be completed either in -clinic, at home by a home health -care provider (if approved 
locally), or by using a local laboratory upon Investigator approval.  
During a n clinic visit, all blood samples should be drawn prior to ION -682884 or inotersen 
administration (exceptions are the post -dose samples in the PK subgroup).  ION-682884 or 
inotersen may be administered by either Study Center personnel (during a clinic visit) or at home 
by the patient/caregiver/ho me health -care provider (See Section  8.1).  Dosing instructions and 
training will be provided to the patient on Day 1 and to any caregiver, as needed.  
For patients in the inotersen treatment arm, the last inotersen dose will be at Week 34.  On 
Weeks 35 and 36 there is no dosing with inotersen.  Patients in the inotersen treatment arm will 
complete the Week 35 assessments and then cross over to ION -682884  once -every -4-weeks  
treatment starting at Week 37.  
In addition to ION -682884 or inotersen, patients will also take daily supplemental doses of the 
RDA of vitamin A (approximately 3000 IU vitamin A or similar dose as available in the region 
in which the patient resides).  Vitamin A may be taken  as either a single vitamin A supplement, 
or as part of a multivitamin.  The vitamin A supplement should be taken throughout the 
Treatment and Post-Treatment Evaluation Period .  Vitamin A supplement at doses more than the 
RDA is not recommended.   
Vitamin A deficiency will be monitored by having the patient periodically complete a  vitamin A 
deficiency screening questionnaire (called “ocular questionnaire”).  In cases of suspected 
vitamin  A deficiency, a consultation with ophthalmologist may be requested by the Investigator, 
if deemed necessary, after discussing with the Medical Mon itor. 
For Weeks 35 , 37, 65 and 6 6 there is a ± 10 days window; for all other visits, there is a ± 7 days 
window.  All reasonable attempts should be made to ensure compliance with the visit schedule as 
outlined in the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix  A).  However, in the event that a visit does not 
occur or is delayed, all subsequent visits should be calculated based on the time elapsed sin ce 
Day 1 rather than from the date of the previous visit.    
Patients randomized to the ION -682884 treatment arm will have their  platelet count, eGFR, 
UPCR, and LFTs assessed once every 4 weeks during the Treatment Period.   
Patients randomized to the inotersen reference arm will have their platelet count , eGFR, UPCR, 
and LFTs assessed every 2 weeks during the Treatment Period up to and including Week  34.  
After Week 34, patients assigned to the inotersen reference arm will transition to receive 
ION 682884 through the end of the Treatment Period.  After patients in the inotersen reference 
arm transition to ION -682884, they will continue to have every 2 -week platelet count, eGFR, 
UPCR, and LFTs measurements for 8 weeks after their last dose  of inotersen .  They will then be 
assessed every 4 week s for platelet count, eGFR, UPCR, and LFTs through the end of the 
Treatment Period.   682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
53  The window for blood collections that occur outside clinic visits is ± 4 days.  See Section  8.5 for 
guidance on ION -682884 or inotersen dosing relative to hematology and chemistry monitoring.  
Key efficacy endpoints (serum TTR reduction, mNIS+7, Norfolk QOL -DN) will be assessed a t 
3 landmark visits (Week s 35, 66, and 85).  Patients will be encouraged to complete these visits 
even if on dose pause or if treatment has been permanently discontinued prematurely.  
6.1.4.  End-of-Treatment Assessment Visit   
The EOT efficacy assessments are cond ucted at Week 85 and should be performed within 
28 days from the last dose of ION -682884.  For those who do not complete dosing, please see  
Section  8.8 for guidance on follow -up procedures.  
6.1.5.  Post-Treatment Evaluation Period  
After completion of the EOT efficacy assessment, patients will complete the Post-Treatment 
Evaluation Period which consis ts of 5 study visits on Weeks  89, 93, 97, 101 and 105, as outlined 
in the schedule of procedures ( Appendix  A).  Alternatively, after completion of the EOT efficacy 
assessment, eligible patients may elect to receive ION -682884 in an OLE study, pending study 
approval by the IRB/IEC and the appropriate regulatory authority.  In this case, patients will not 
participate in the Post-Treatment Evaluation Period . 
6.2. Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory analyte samples will be collected throughout the study.  A list of these analytes is 
contained in Appendix  B.  All patients will be required to fast for 8 –10 hours before assessment 
of retinyl palmitate (Weeks  1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 65, 85, 93, and 105).   Collection of laboratory 
samples for assessment of serum vitamin A levels should precede the ingestion of vitamin A  or 
multivitamin supplement for that day (Screening/Baseline, Weeks 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 65, 85, 93, 
and 105).   During this time, the patient can drink water and they should ensure that they do not 
become dehydrated.  
If the results  of these assessments  are u ninterpretable (e.g., missing sample, hemolysis) the 
Investigator should request a new test as soon as possible.  If  evaluable results for platelets, 
eGFR or UPCR are not available for the Investigator to review by the date of administration of 
the Study D rug, or the results are from an assessment older than 14  days ±7 days from the dosing 
day (±7 days allows for visit window) , the patient should be instructed to hold dosing until the 
new results are available and interpretable.  Note:  if there are 2  sets of lab value results within 
the previous 14  days ±7 days  of the dosing day, the most recent one should be used for deciding 
whether dose administration should proceed.   Please see Section  8.5 for more detail.  
6.3. Restriction on the Lifestyle of Patients  
6.3.1.  Contraception Requirements  
All male patients and WOCBP must refrain from sperm/egg donation and either be abstin ent† or 
use highly effective contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form until at 
least 24 weeks after their last dose of study treatment.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
54  For male patients engaged in se xual relations with a WOCBP, the patient or the patient’s 
non-pregnant female partner must use a highly effective contraception method from the time of 
signing the informed consent form until at least 2 4 weeks after their last dose of ION -682884 or 
inoters en.  Male patients with partners that are pregnant must use condoms to ensure that the 
fetus is not exposed to the ION -682884 or inotersen.  
For the purposes of this study, WOCBP are defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche, and who does not meet 1 of the following conditions:  
• Postmenopausal:  12  months of spontaneous amenorrhea in females > 55 years of age 
or, in females ≤ 55 years, 12  months of spontaneous amenorrhea without an 
alternative medical cause and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range for the 
laboratory involved  
• 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy  
• Post-hysterectomy  
For the purposes of the study, highly effective contraception is defined as follows:  
For male patients:  
• Highly effective male contracep tion includes a vasectomy with negative semen 
analysis at follow -up, or the non -pregnant female partner of WOCBP uses a highly 
effective contraceptive method (defined below)  
• Male patients with partners that are pregnant must use condoms as contraception to  
ensure that the fetus is not exposed to the ION -682884 or inotersen  
For female patients and female partners of male patients, highly effective female contraception 
methods comprise:  
• Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion), hormonal contra ception  
associated with inhibition of ovulation (combined estrogen and progestogen 
containing), intrauterine contraception device or intrauterine hormone -releasing 
system (IUS)  
†Note:  Abstinence (i.e., refraining from heterosexual intercourse throughout the duration of 
study participation) is only acceptable as true abstinence, i.e., when this is in line with 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declarati on of abstinence for the 
duration of a trial and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Note:  A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction 
between the two can result in either or both products failing.  
6.3.2.  Other Re quirements  
All patients will be required to fast for 8 –10 hours before assessment of retinyl palmitate 
(Weeks  1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 65, 85, 89, 93, and 105 .  Collection of laboratory samples for 
assessment of serum vitamin A levels should precede the ingestion of vitamin A or multivitamin 
supplement for that day  (Screenin g/Baseline, Weeks  1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 65 , 85, 89, 93, and 105 ).  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

For the pur poses of safety monitoring for liver chemistry tests, renal parameters, and platelet 
count, “ Baseline ” is defined as:  
• The a verage of the pre -dose test closest to Day 1 and Day 1.  The window for blood 
collections ( hematology and chemistry ) that occur outsi de clinic visits is ± 4 days  
In addition to the standard monitoring of clinical safety parameters, the following guidelines are 
provided for the monitoring of selected parameters chosen based on preclinical and clinical 
observations.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
57  Confirmation Guidance :  At any time during the study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Period s), 
the initial clinical laboratory results meeting the safety monitoring criteria presented below must 
be confirmed by performing measurements (ideally in the same laboratory that performed  the 
initial measurement) on new specimens.  All new specimen collections should take place as soon 
as possible (ideally within 3 days of the initial collection).  For stopping rules, if the initial 
laboratory result is observed during the Treatment Period , the results from the retest must be 
available prior to administering the next dose of ION‑682884  or inotersen . 
Re-dosing Guidance :  Patients with initial laboratory test values that reach a stopping rule must 
not be re -dosed until the re -test results are available.   In general, patients who do not meet the 
stopping rules based upon retest may continue dosing.  However, the Investigator and the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor (or appropriately qualified designee) should confer as to whether 
additional close monitoring of the patient is appropriate.   If any of the stopping criteria described 
below (refer to Section  8.6.1  through Section  8.6.3 ) are met, the patient will be permanently 
discontinued from further treatment with ION‑682884  or inotersen , evaluated fully as outlined 
below and in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or appropriately qualified designee, 
and will be followed up in accordance with Section  8.8 of the protocol.   
8.5.1.  Safety Monitoring Rules for Liver Chemistry Tests  
The following rules are adapted from the draft guidance for industry, “Drug -Induced Liver 
Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, Food and Drug Administration, July 2009.   For a definition of Baseline , please refer to 
guidance in Section  8.5 above.  
Monitoring frequency will be once every 4 weeks in patients randomized to the ION -682884 
treatment arm until the end of the Treatment Period.   
Patients randomized to the inotersen reference arm will have their liver chemistry assessed every 
2 weeks during the Treatment Period up to and including Week 34.  After patients in the 
inotersen reference arm transition to ION -682884 they will continue to have every 2 week liver 
chemistry measurements for 8 weeks after their last dose o f inotersen.  They will then be 
assessed every 4 weeks, through the end of the Treatment Period.   
For inotersen patients who terminate treatment before the end of the Treatment Period, liver 
chemistry measurements should be monitored once every 2 weeks, f or a duration of 8  weeks.   
In the event of an ALT or AST measurement that is > 3 × ULN (or 2 × Baseline  value if the 
Baseline  value was > ULN) at any time during the study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Period ), 
repeat testing should be performed within 48 to 72 hours of liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, 
ALP, total bilirubin  and international normalized ratio [INR]) to confirm the abnormalities and to 
determine if they are increasing or decreasing.  There also should be inquiry made about 
symptoms.  Additiona l, confirmatory measurements should also be performed if ALT or AST 
levels increase to 5 × ULN.  
If new onset symptoms of anorexia, nausea, fatigue, right upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting 
present with unclear etiology, liver enzymes should be measured.  
Frequency of Repeat Measurements :  Patients with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3  × ULN 
(or 2 × Baseline  value if the Baseline  value was > ULN) should have their liver chemistry tests  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
58  (ALT, AST, ALP,  INR and total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin) r etested 2 or 3 times 
weekly.   Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or 
the trial drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic (see below) .  
Further Investigation into Liver Chemistry Elevations :  For patients with confirmed ALT or AST 
levels > 3 × ULN (or 2 × Baseline  value if the Baseline  value was > ULN), the following 
evaluations should be included in the work up:  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent diseases  
• Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including nonprescription 
medications, herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational 
drug use, and special diets  
• Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and trave l 
• Serology for viral hepatitis (HAV immunoglobulin M [ IgM], HBsAg, HCV antibody, 
cytomegalovirus [ CMV ] IgM, and EBV antibody panel)  
• Serology for autoimmune hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear antibody [ANA], antismooth 
muscle antibody, type 1 anti -liver kidney microsomal antibody)  
Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic CT or 
MRI scans, may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, in consultation with the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor .  Repetition of the ab ove evaluations should be considered if a 
patient’s ALT and/or AST levels reach 5 × ULN.  
8.5.2.  Safety Monitoring for Renal Function  
Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR creat -cys, calculated using the 
CKD -EPI creatinine -cystatin C equation  [2012 ]), urinalysis, and UPCR should be monitored 
every 4 weeks in all patients randomized to the ION-682884 treatment arm  and every 2 weeks in 
all patients randomized to the inotersen  reference arm , up to and including Week 34.  After 
Week 34, patients a ssigned to the inotersen reference arm will transition to receive ION -682884 
through the end of the Treatment Period.  After patients in the inotersen reference arm transition 
to ION -682884, they will continue to have every 2 -week measurements for 8 weeks after their 
last dose of inotersen.  They will then be assessed every 4 weeks through the end of the 
Treatment Period. .   
For inotersen patients who terminate treatment before the end of the Treatment Period, renal 
function should be monitored once every 2  weeks, for a duration of 8  weeks..  
In the event of a confirmed (as  described in Section  8.5) laboratory result meeting 1 or more of 
the following criteria:  
a. Creatinine clearance ( eGFR creat -cyst) decrease from Baseline  > 25%  
b. UPCR > 3 × Baseline  AND >  1000 mg/g  
Renal function will be monitored weekly until further work up and/or resolution per Investigator 
judgment in consultation with the Medical Monitor .  If there is further worsening in renal 
function, refer to Section  8.6.2  for guidance.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
59  8.5.3.  Safety Monitoring Rules for Platelet Count Results  
Please refer also to Table 3 and Table 4. 
Platelet count monitoring frequency will be once every 4 weeks in patients randomized to the 
ION-682884 treatment arm until the end of the Treatment Period.   
Patients randomized to the inotersen reference arm will have their platelet count assessed every 
2 weeks during the Treatment Period up to and including Week 34.  After Week 34, patients 
assigned to the inotersen reference arm will transition to receive ION -682884 through the end of  
the Treatment Period.  After patients in the inotersen reference arm transition to ION -682884, 
they will continue to have every 2 -week platelet count measurements for 8 weeks after their last 
dose of inotersen.  They will then be assessed every 4 weeks fo r platelet count through the end of 
the Treatment Period.   
For inotersen patients who terminate treatment before the end of the Treatment Period , platelets 
should be monitored once every 2 weeks, for a duration of 8 weeks.  
The Investigator should documen t review of all platelet count results within 48 hours of receipt.  
For patients on ION -682884 or inotersen, if a patient’s platelet count falls to less than 
100 × 109/L but more than 75  × 109/L, then the patient’s platelet counts should be monitored 
weekly .  In case of platelet reduction to below 75  × 109/L, the platelet monitoring rules for 
ION-682884 or inotersen defined in Stopping rules ( Section  8.6.3 , Table 4) should be followed.  
If a patient’s platelet count falls to ≤ 50 × 109/L, the Inves tigator must communicate to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of receiving the platelet result.  
Treatment should be withheld if there is no evaluable platelet count within 14 days  ±7 days  prior 
to the scheduled dose.  Any unreportable platelet count result must  be rechecked and determined 
not to have met a stopping rule before dosing can continue.  
In the event of a platelet count <  100 × 109/L, additional laboratory investigations may be 
conducted ( Table 3).   682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

8.5.4.  Safety Monitoring for Minor Bleeding Events  
Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding (MB) or 
clinically  relev ant, non -major bleeding events which are defined in Section  8.6.3 , for example 
excess bruising, petechiae, gingival bleeding on brushing teeth.  If a minor bleeding event 
occurs, additional testing of coagulation parameters (aPTT, PT, INR) and platelet count should 
be performed.  
8.5.5.  Safety Monitoring Rules for Ocular Effects  
An ocular questionnaire designed to screen for vitamin A deficiency will be adminis tered 
periodically (every 2 to 3 months) during Treatment Period .  Any patient who presents with new 
and persistent ocular symptoms compatible with vitamin A deficiency (e.g., night blindness or 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
61  dry eyes) should be referred for an ophthalmology examination .  If the ophthalmologist confirms 
the patient’s symptoms are consistent with vitamin A deficiency and/or the examination reveals 
physical findings that are consistent with vitamin A deficiency (but do not reach the stopping 
rule criteria described in Section 8.6.4 ) then additional work up with a corneal specialist should 
be considered.   In addition, it is suggested that a review of diet and supplement use and an 
evaluation for factors which may contribute to low vitamin A levels such as infection, alcohol 
consumption, and zinc and/or iron deficiency be conducted.  
Dosing with ION -682884 o r inotersen may continue while these evaluations are being 
performed.  
8.6. Stopping Rules  
For the purposes of the stopping rules, Baseline  is defined as:   average of the pre -dose test 
closest to Day 1 and Day 1.  
8.6.1.  Stopping Rules for Liver Chemistry Elevations  
In the event of laboratory results meeting the following criteria, and the event is without an 
alternative explanation as discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor,  dosing of a patient 
with ION -682884 or inotersen will be stopped permanently; values that a re not confirmed due 
failure to retest or missing lab values will be presumed confirmed:  
1. ALT or AST >  8 × ULN, which is confirmed  
2. ALT or AST >  5 × ULN, which is confirmed and persists for ≥ 2 weeks  
3. ALT or AST >  3 × ULN (or 2 × Baseline  value if the Baseline  value was > ULN), which 
is confirmed and total bilirubin >  2 × ULN or INR >  1.5 
4. ALT or AST >  3 × ULN (or 2 × Baseline  value if the Baseline  value was > ULN) with 
the new appearance (i.e ,. onset coincides with the changes in hepatic enzymes) of fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or concomitant 
eosinophilia (>  ULN)  
8.6.2.  Stopping Rules for Renal Function Test Results and Temporary Stopping Rules 
for Renal Function Test Results  
Dosing should be stopped t emporarily in the event of a persistent elevation that is observed over 
2 consecutive weeks, for any of the 4  criteria below:  
1. A decrease in eGFR creat -cys > 50% (eGFR creat -cys is calculated using the CKD -EPI 
creatinine -cystatin C equation [2012 ]).   
2. eGFR creat-cys < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (if Baseline  eGFR creat -cys > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
3. eGFR creat -cys < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (if Baseline  eGFR creat -cys ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
4. Proteinuria:  Random UPCR > 5 × Baseline  AND >  1500  mg/g; or absolute UPCR 
value  ≥ 2000 mg/g (confirmed by a repeat random spot UPCR ≥ 2000 mg/g or a 
24 hr UPCR ≥ 2000 mg/24 hr)  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
62  The possible dosing re -initiation or follow -up schedule for any events meeting either of these 
criteria will be determined by the Investigator in consultation with  the Spo nsor Medical 
Monitor or designee.  
If a dose is held, once eGFR creat -cys increases to ≥ 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, UPCR decreases to 
below 1000 mg/g, or the underlying cause of the decline in renal function is corrected, dosing 
may be reinitiated.  In the case o f UPCR of 2000 mg/g or higher, further evaluation for renal 
disease should be performed.  If acute glomerulonephritis is confirmed, treatment should be 
permanently discontinued.  
Dosing of a patient will be stopped  permanently if urinalysis or renal blood tests confirm any of 
the following values in the absence of an alternative explanation agree d by a consulting 
nephrologist:  
• urine protein is > 2 g  (in 24 -hour urine)  
• creatinine clearance < 45  mL/min/1.73 m2 (if Baseline  CKD -EPI > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
• creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (if Baseline  CKD -EPI ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
Irrespective of whether the stopping rule is confirmed or not, the follow -up schedule and 
frequency of renal function monitoring after the initial event will be determined b y the Study 
Medical Monitor in consultation with the Investigator and a renal consult will be requested.

In the event of any platelet count less than 25  × 109/L, dosing of the patient with ION -682884 or 
inotersen will be stopped permanently.  Platelet count should be monitored daily until 
2 successive values above 25  × 109/L.  Then monitor  twice weekly until 3 successive values 
above 75  × 109/L.  Then weekly monitoring until 3 successive values  ≥100 × 109/L.  
Administration of steroids is recommended for patients whose platelet count is less than 
50 × 109/L.  Treatment guidelines for immune  thrombocytopenia (Provan et al. 2010 ) 
recommend dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days every 2 –4 weeks for 1 -4 cycles; 
prednis(ol)one 0.5 -2 mg/kg/d for 2 –4 weeks then taper; or methylprednisolone  30 mg/kg/day for 
7 days.   (Note:  Patient may require continuation with oral steroids after methylprednisolone .) 
In the event of a platelet count ˂ 75  × 109/L and ≥ 25  × 109/L, and in the absence of major 
bleeding  (MB)  or clinically  relevant non -major ble eding (defined below), dosing with ION -
682884 or  inotersen should be suspended temporarily until the platelet count has recovered to 
≥ 100 × 109/L.  The suitability of the patient for continued dosing will be determined by the 
Investigator in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor and will be based on factors such as 
the original rate of decline in the patient’s platelet count, whether any bleeding events were 
experienced, and the speed of recovery of platelet count after interruption of dosing.  Treat ment 
should be held if there is no evaluable platelet count within 14 days ±7 days prior to the 
scheduled dose.  Any unreportable platelet count result must be rechecked and determined not to 
have met a stopping rule before dosing can continue.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

63  Definition  of Major Bleeding Events (Schulman and Kearon 2005 ) 
1. Fatal bleeding, and/or  
2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarterial or pericardial, or intramuscular with 
compartment syndrome  
3. Clinically overt bleeding leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells or 
whole blood or a fall in hemoglobin of 2.0 mg/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more within 24  hours  
Definition of Clinically  Relevant Non -Major Bleeding Events  
Clinically  relevant non -major bleeding (CRNMB) is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the 
criteria for MB but that resulted, for example, in medical examination, intervention, or had 
clinical co nsequences for a patient.  
Definition of Minor Bleeding Events  
Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for MB or clinically  relevant, non -
major bleeding events (defined above), for example excess bruising, petechiae, gingival bleedi ng 
on brushing teeth.

permanently discontinued.   
‡  Additional risk factors for bleeding include age > 60 years, receiving anticoagulant or antiplate let medicinal 
products, and /or prior history of MB events  
* It is strongly recommended that, unless corticosteroids are contraindicated, the patient receives glucocorticoid 
therapy to reverse the platelet decline as recovery in platelet count may be accelerated by administration of 
high-dose steroids.  Treatment guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (Provan et al. 2010 ) recommend 
dexamethasone 40  mg daily for 4 days every 2 –4 weeks for 1 –4 cycles; prednis(ol)one 0.5 –2 mg/kg/d for 
2-4 weeks then taper; or methylprednisolone 30  mg/kg/day for 7 days (note:  may require continuation with oral 
steroids after methylprednisolone)  
8.6.4.  Stopping Rule for Ocular Effects  
A patient should be permanently disc ontinued from Study Drug administration if they 
demonstrate  clear signs of vitamin A deficiency confirmed by an ophthalmologist  and discussed 
with the Investigator . 
8.7. Adjustment of Dose and/or Treatment Schedule  
No dose adjustment is planned, other than for safety reasons.  Any proposed adjustment to 
treatment schedule or dose level must be discussed with the Study Medical Monitor prior to 
initiation.  If the patient remains stable after adjustment, he/she may be cautiously returned to the 
original dose/regimen after consultation with the Study  Medical Monitor.  
Patients may be dose paused in response to AEs ideally after consultation with the 
Study  Medical Monitor.  Minimally, Study Medical Monitor should be notified of all dosing 
changes.  
8.8. Discontin uation of ION -682884 or Inotersen Treatment  
The reasons for permanently discontinuation of Study Drug administration are:  
• Patient request (no consent withdrawal for study participation)  
• Patient withdrawal of consent for study participation  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
66  • Protocol specific requirements  
O The patient becomes pregnant.  Report the pregnancy according to instructions in  
Section  9.5.4  
O The patient presents laborator y test abnormalities that meet any of the stopping  rules 
listed in Section s 8.6.1  to  8.6.4  
O The patient receives major organ transplantation  
• Investigator decision (e.g., AE, non -compliant patient)  
• Sponsor decision  
The reason for discontinuation of ION -682884 or inotersen must be re corded in the electronic 
Case Report Form (eCRF) and source documentation.   
The Investigator will also work with patients and Sponsor to determine followup study visits and 
assessments after treatment termination.  Ideally, patients who discontinue ION -682884 or 
inotersen treatment early will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue with protocol 
procedures and visits to collect efficacy endpoints and safety data.   This is especially important 
for efficacy assessment on the landmark visits (Weeks 35, 66, 85 , and 105 ).  
Listed below is a guideline that can be used to determine which procedures should be performed 
depending on the patient’s willingness for follow -up.  Note that this will not account for all 
patient scenarios.  Investigators are encou raged to contact the Medical Monitor to discuss each 
patient that will discontinue study treatment early.  Variables such as length of time off drug, 
recent or current AEs including events described in Section  8.5 may result in modifications to the 
guidelines below.  
1. Patient agrees to full follow -up 
• Complete the Early Term ination  Visit  
• Complete any required safety monitoring (see Section s 8.5 and 9.4) 
• Ensure patient has 20 weeks of safety follow -up after the last dose of ION -682884 or 
inotersen  
• Complete of all remaining study visits and procedures through Week 85 as well as 
survival status at Week 105  
• Update AE and Concomitant Medication information through last contact  
2. Patient only agrees to targeted follow -up 
• Complete the Early Term ination  Visit  
• Complete any required safety monitoring (see Sections  8.5 and 9.4) 
• Return to the clinic to complete key efficacy assessments  (serum TTR reduction, 
mNIS+7, Norfolk QOL -DN) on the landmark visits (Weeks 35, 66, 85 , and 105 ) 
• Ensure patie nt has 20 weeks of safety follow -up after the last dose of ION -682884 or 
inotersen  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
67  • Update AE and Concomitant Medication information through last contact  
3. Patient only agrees to survival status follow -up 
• Request that patient complete the Early Term ination  Visit  
• Request completion of any required safety monitoring (see Sections  8.5 and 9.4) 
• Collect data (e.g., AEs, concomitant medications, survival status) at Weeks  35, 
66, 85, and 105 from one or more sources agreed to by patient (i.e., via 
correspondence/communication with patient, family/friends, other physicians, and/or 
from review of the medical records, as allowed per local laws and as stated in the 
IEC/IRB -appro ved ICF)  
8.9. Discontinuation of Study Participation  
The reasons for discontinuing patient participation in the study are:  
• Patient withdrawal of consent for study participation  
• At the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for noncompliance or significant  
protocol deviation  
All efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to 
the date of withdrawal.  Reason for withdrawal from study must be recorded in the eCRF.  
If consent is withdrawn, patient will be removed from  further treatment and study observation 
immediately upon the date of request.   
Withdrawal  of consent by patient should be avoided as much as possible so that patient can be 
followed up in the trial for safety and efficacy.   Ideally, attempts need to be m ade to complete 
landmark visits.  Minimally, communication should be established with patients to obtain vital 
status at Week s 35, 66, 85, and 105 by using the t ype of follow -up the patient is agreeable to: in 
person, by phone/mail, through family/friends,  via correspondence/communication with other 
physicians, and/or from review of the medical records.  The agreed means of follow -up will be 
documented in the patient records and notified to the Sponsor.    
8.10. Concomitant Therapy and Procedures  
The use of concomitant therapies or procedures defined below must be recorded on the patient’s 
eCRF.  Adverse events related to administration of these therapies or procedures must also be 
documented on the appropriate eCRF.  
8.10.1.  Concomitant Therapy  
A concomitant therapy is any non -protocol specified drug or substance (including over -the-
counter medications, herbal medications and vitamin supplements) administered between signing 
of informed consent and the last study visit.  
Patients are required to take daily RDA supplem ental doses of vitamin A during the Treatment 
and Post-Treatment Evaluation Periods .  The vitamin A supplements will be provided by the 
Study Center  and/or Sponsor.  A patient may be allowed to substitute the Study Center  provided 
vitamin A supplement with  their own, only after consultation with the Study Medical Monitor.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
68  Additional vitamin A supplements (other than those described above) are not allowed at any time 
during the study unless approved by the Study Medical Monitor (this includes multivitamin 
supplements that contain vitamin A).  
Allowed Concomitant Therapy  
Any medications deemed necessary by the Investigator are allowed except those listed in the 
disallowed concomitant therapy.  
Disallowed Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy with the followin g drugs is not allowed:  Vyndaqel® / Vyndamax™ 
(tafamidis), Tegsedi™ (inotersen), Onpattro™ (patisiran) or off -label use of diflunisal.  
Doxycycline short term use for the indication of infection (< 15 days) is allowed.  
8.10.2.  Concomitant Procedures  
A concomitan t procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) 
or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between  
signing of informed consent and the last study visit.  
8.11. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with treatment dosing is to be monitored and recorded in the eCRF by Study Center  
staff.   
Patients will record treatment in a dosing diary that will be reviewed periodically by Study 
Center  staff and the Clinical Monitor.  
9. SERIOUS AND NON -SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING   
9.1. Sponsor Review of Safety Information  
Safety information will be collected, reviewed, and evaluated by the Sponsor  in accordance with 
the applicable Ionis and/or designee SOPs throughout the conduct of the clinical trial.  
9.2. Regulatory  Requirements  
The Sponsor is responsible for regulatory submissions and reporting to the Investigators of SAEs 
including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) per the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines E2A and ICH GCP.  Country -specific regulatory 
requirements will be followed in accordance with local country regulations and guidelines.  
Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC) will be notified of any 
SAE according to applicable regulatio ns.  The DSMB will be notified of any SAE as specified in 
the DSMB charter.  
In addition to the Investigator’s assessment of relatedness, the  Sponsor will evaluate the 
available information and perform an independent assessment of all reported SAEs and 
determine if there is a reasonable possibility that the ION -682884 or inotersen is causally related 
to a reported SAE.  While the Sponsor may upgrade an Investigator’s decision it is not 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
69  permissible to downgrade the Investigator’s opinion for the purposes of d etermining whether the 
SAE meets the definition of a SUSAR.   If the event is considered by the Sponsor or designee  to 
meet the definition of a SUSAR, the event will be reported.  
For the purpose of regulatory reporting of SUSARs, there are no “expected” AEs  in this study 
population.   
9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
An AE can therefore be any of the following:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated w ith the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, 
frequency, or severity of a known condition)  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
Baseline  
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuatio n from Study Drug or inotersen  
9.3.2.  Adverse Drug Reaction and Suspected Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
In the pre-approval  clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not have been established, ADR is defined as follows:  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should 
be considered adverse drug reactions.  
The phrase “responses to a medicinal product ” means that a causal relationship between the 
medicinal product and the AE has been determined by the Sponsor as at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cann ot be ruled out.  
Suspected Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
A suspected unexpected ADR is any ADR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information, e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved medicinal 
(invest igational) product.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
70  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse 
reaction.  
9.3.3.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE  is any AE that in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, meets any of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening:   that is, poses an immediate risk of death at the time of the event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient  at immediate risk 
of death.  It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that , had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined as an admission of greater than 24 hours to a medical 
facility and does not always qualify as an AE  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the patient (whether 
the patient is male or female)  
• Important medical events  that may not result in death, are not  life-threatening, or do 
not require hospitalization may also be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in thi s 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include  allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse  
The terms “severe ” and “serious ” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NC I CTCAE]; OR Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials; the event itself 
may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further 
findings).  
Severit y and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AE recorded on the eCRF.  
9.3.4.  Adverse Event of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI), including both serious or non -serious events, is one of 
scientific and medical concern speci fic to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing 
monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor could be appropriate.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
71  Adverse events of special interest, if defined in the study protocol, are required to be reported by 
the Investigator to the Sponsor immediately, no more than 24 hours of the Investigator’s first 
knowledge of the event.  
For the purpose of this study, severe reductions in platelet count < 50  × 109/L accompanied by a 
MB or CRNMB, or platelet count of < 25  × 109/L independent of a MB or CRNMB event are 
considered as AEs of special interest and should be subject to 15 -day expedited reporting by the 
Sponsor to the regulatory agencies.  
9.4. Monitoring and Recording Adverse Events  
Any pre -existing conditions or signs and/ or symptoms present in a patient prior to the start of the 
study (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as 
AEs unless the pre -existing condition worsened.  The Investigator should always group signs and 
sympt oms into a single term that constitutes a  single unifying diagnosis  if possible.  Before a 
diagnosis is confirmed, all symptoms should be reported as separate AEs.  
9.4.1.  Serious Adverse Events  
In the interest of subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory  requirements , all SAEs 
(regardless of their relationship to ION -682884 or inotersen) should be reported to the Sponsor  
within 24 hours of the Study Center ’s first knowledge of the  event.  The collection of SAEs will 
begin after the patient signs the informed consent form and stop at the end of the subject’s 
Follow -up Period which is defined as the final study visit (Week 105 or last visit if patient early 
terminates) .  SAEs should be reported using an electronic SAE submission form within 
Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) whenever possible.  In situations where the electronic SAE 
submission via EDC is unavailable, an  Initial Serious Adverse Event Form should be completed 
and a copy should be faxed or emailed to the Sponsor .  The SAE reporting ins truction, including 
the fax number and email address can be found in the Investigator site file for the study.  
Detailed information should be actively sought and included on Follow -Up Serious Adverse 
Event Forms as soon as additional information becomes av ailable.  All SAEs will be followed 
until resolution.  SAEs that remain ongoing past the patient’s last protocol -specified follow -up 
visit will be evaluated by the Investigator and Sponsor.  If the Investigator and Sponsor agree the 
patient’s condition is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator and Sponsor will determine the 
follow -up requirement.  
9.4.2.  Non-Serious Adverse Events  
The recording of non -serious AEs will begin after the patient signs the informed consent form 
and will stop at the end of the patient’s F ollow -up Period, which is defined as the final study visit 
(Week 105 or last visit if patient early terminates ; Section  3.4.3 ).  The Investigator will monitor 
each patient closely and record all observed or volunteered AEs on the Adverse Event Case 
Report Form.  
9.4.3.  Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non -Serious)  
The Investigator’s opinion of the following should be documented on the Adverse Event Case 
Report Form : 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
72  9.4.3.1.  Relationship to the use of ION -682884 or Inotersen  
The event’s relationship to ION‑682884  or inotersen  is characterized by 1 of the following:  
• Related:   There is clear evidence that the event is related to the use of ION -682884 or 
inotersen, e.g., confirmation by positive re -challenge test  
• Possible:   The event cannot be explained by the patient’s medical condition, 
concomitant therapy, or other causes, a nd there is a plausible temporal relationship 
between the event and ION‑682884  or inotersen  administration  
• Unlikely/Remote:  An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely 
(e.g.,  concomitant medicati ons or ongoing medical conditions) or the temporal 
relationship to ION‑682884  or inotersen  administration and/or exposure suggests that 
a causal relationship  is unlikely (For reporting purposes, Unlikely/Remote wi ll be 
grouped together with Not Related)  
• Not Related:   The event can be readily explained by the  patient’s underlying medical 
condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator 
believes no relationship exists between the event  and ION -682884 or inotersen  
9.4.3.2.  Severity  
The severity of AEs and SAEs relating to laboratory tests and AEs at the injection site will be 
graded based on criteria from the CTCAE Version 5.0, November 2017 (refer to Appendix  D).  
Any AE not listed in Appendix  D will be graded as follows:  
• Mild:   The event is easily tolerated by the patient and does not affect the patient’s 
usual daily activities  
• Moderate:   The event causes the patient more discomfort and interrupts the patient’s 
usual daily activities  
• Severe:  The event is incapacitating and causes co nsiderable interference with the 
patient’s usual daily activities  
If the event is an SAE, then all applicable seriousness criteria  must be indicated (criteria listed in 
Section  9.3.2 ). 
9.4.3.3.  Action Taken with ION -682884 / Inotersen  
Action taken with ION‑682884  or inotersen due to the event is characterized by 1 of the 
following.  
• None:   No changes were made to treatment and dosing  
• Permanently Discontinued:   Treatment was discontinued and not restarted  
• Temporarily Interrupted, restarted:   Dosing was temporarily interrupted or 
delayed due to the AE and restarted  
• Reduced dose:   Dosing was reduced to a lower dose  
• Reduced schedule:   Dosing frequency was reduced  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
73  9.4.3.4.  Treatment Given for Adverse Event  
Any treatment (e.g., medications or procedures) given for the AE should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Case Report Form.  T reatment should also be r ecorded on the concomitant 
treatment or ancillary procedures eCRF , as appropriate.  
9.4.3.5.  Outcome of the Adverse Event  
If the event is a non -serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following:  
• AE Persists:   Patient terminates from the tri al and the AE continues  
• Recovered:   Patient recovered completely from the AE  
• Became Serious:   The event became serious (the date that the event became serious 
should be recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Onset Date of the 
corresponding SAE)  
• Change in Severity (if applicable):   AE severity changed  
If the event is an SAE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following:  
• Ongoing:   SAE continuing  
• Persists (as non -serious AE):   Patient has not fully recovered but the event no longer 
meets serious criteria and should be captured as a non-serious AE on the AE eCRF 
(the SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE)  
• Recovered:   Patient recovered completely from the SAE (the date of recovery should 
be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Recovered with Sequelae:   The signs/symptoms of the reported SAE have improved 
but not completely resolved, and a new Baseline  for the patient i s established since 
full recovery is not expected  
• Fatal:   Patient died (the date of death should be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
9.4.3.6.  Follow -up of Adverse Event  
Investigator Follow -Up 
During the Study Period, the Investigator should follow each AE until the event has resolved to 
Baseline  grade or better, the event is assessed as stable, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the 
patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered to be 
related to ION -682884 or inotersen, or  related to study procedures until a final outcome can be 
reported.  
Resolution of AE (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the 
patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
Investigator should follow -up, or support the Sponsor’s effort to follow up with all pregnancies 
reported during the study from either the study patient or the female partner of male study patient 
until pregnancy outcome is available.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
74  Sponsor Follow -Up 
For SAEs, AESI and pregnancy cases i n patients who have completed or terminated study, the 
Sponsor or a designee should follow -up by telephone, fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, 
consultant  reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the 
reported case.  
9.5. Procedures for Handling Special Situations  
9.5.1.  Abnormalities of Laboratory Tests  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results may, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
constitute or be associated with an AE.  Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results 
that are associated with symptoms, or require treatment, e.g., bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, 
tetany due to hypocalcemia, or cardiac arrh ythmias due to hyperkalemia.  Whenever possible, the 
underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs.  
Clinically significant abnormalities will be monitored by the Investigator until the parameter 
returns to its Baseline  value or until agreement is reached between the Investigator and Sponsor 
Medical Monitor.  Laboratory abnormalities deemed not clinically significant (NCS) by the 
Investigator should not be reported as AEs.  Similarly, laboratory abnormalities repor ted as AEs 
by the Investigator should not be deemed NCS on the laboratory report.  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports.  The signed 
clinical laboratory reports will serve as source documents and should include th e Investigator’s 
assessment of clinical significance of out of range/abnormal laboratory values.  
9.5.2.  Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be consi dered 
an SAE, even if the patient  is hospitalized; the Study Center  must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the patient’s 
consent to participate in the study  
• The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely 
scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opinion 
of the Investigator between the patient’s con sent to participate in the study and the 
timing of the procedure or treatment  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospital admission  
9.5.3.  Dosing Errors  
ION‑682884  or inotersen errors (including overdose, underdose, and administration error) should 
be documented as Protocol Deviations , subcategory Dosing Error .  A brief description should be 
provided in the deviation, including whether the patient  was symptomatic (list symptoms) or 
asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
75  Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing Case Report Form.  If the patient takes a dose 
of ION‑682884  or inotersen that exceeds protocol specifications and the patient is symptomatic, 
then the symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported per Section  9.4. 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose 
being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an AE, but 
it may result in an AE.  Any overdose or incorrect administration of ION-682884 or inotersen  
should be noted on the Study Drug Admini stration eCRF .  All AEs associated with an overdose 
or incorrect administration of ION -682884 or inotersen should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.   If the associated AE fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24  hours after learning of the event).  
Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should refer to the Guidance to 
Investigator’s section  of the Investigator’s Brochure and  contact the Sponsor or designee within 
24 hours.  
9.5.4.  Contraception and Pregnancy  
Male patients and female patients of child -bearing potential  must continue to use appropriate  
highly effective  contraception with their partner s, or refrain from sexual activity, as described in 
Section  6.3.1 . 
If a patient becomes pregnant or a pregnancy is suspected, or if a male patient ma kes or believes 
that he has made someone pregnant during the study, then the Study Center  staff must be 
informed immediately .  An Initial Pregnancy Form should be submitted to the Sponsor within 
24 hours  of first learning of the occurrence of pregnancy.  Follow -up information including 
delivery or termination is reported by designating as ‘Follow -up’ on the Pregnancy Forms and 
reported within 24 hours.  
Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child or  related care will be the patient’s 
responsibility.   
Female patients :  If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the study (including follow -up), a 
pregnancy test will be performed.  The patient with a confirmed pregnancy will be immediately 
withdrawn from  treatment with ION -682884 or inotersen.  However, the patient will be 
encouraged to complete the post -treatment follow -up portion of the study to the extent that study 
procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy.  Regardless of continued study particip ation, the 
study physician will assist the patient in getting obstetrical care and the progress of the 
pregnancy will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective 
termination, or spontaneous abortion).  If the pregnancy  results in the birth of a child, the Study 
Center  and Sponsor may require access to the mother and infant’s medical records to obtain 
additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome .  A longer follow -up may 
be required if a newborn c hild experiences a medical condition.  Follow -up will be performed to 
the extent permitted by the applicable regulations and privacy considerations; e.g., pregnancy 
ICF may be required.  
Male patients :  The progress of the pregn ancy of a male patient’s part ner should be followed 
until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous 
abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center  and Sponsor may 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

76  follow -up w ith the mother and may reques t access to the mother and infant’s medical 
records to obtain additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.   
A longer follow -up may be required if a newborn child experiences a medical condition.  
Follo w-up will be performed to the  extent permitted by the applicable regulations and privacy 
considerations; e.g., partner ICF may be required.  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
10.1. Study Endpoints  
Study endpoints are described in Section  1.2. 
10.2. Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size for this study was estimated based on the data from the NEURO -TTR clinical 
trial.  
With 140 patients (120 of them dosed with ION -682884) and assumin g a 10% dropout rate, there 
would be 108 evaluable patients treated with ION -682884.  In the NEURO -TTR trial, there are 
52 evaluable placebo patients.  
It is observed that the NEURO -TTR placebo group had a 23.8 point increase in the mNIS+7 
score from Basel ine to Week 66.   It is estimated that the ION -682884 group will have a 4.2  point 
increase in mNIS+7.  The standard deviation of the change from Baseline  is estimated to be 20.  
There would be at least 90% power to detect a 19.6 point difference in the chan ge from Baseline  
of the mNIS+7 score between ION -682884 -treated patients and the NEURO -TTR -placebo 
patients, with a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025.  
For the Norfolk QOL -DN, it is observed that the NEURO -TTR placebo group had 10.7 points 
change from Baseline  to Week 66.  It is estimated that the ION -682884 -treated group will have a 
0 point change from Baseline .  The standard deviation is estimated to be 20.   There would be at 
least 80% power to detect a 10.7 points difference in the change from Baseline  of the  Norfolk 
QOL -DN between ION-682884 -treated patients and the NEURO -TTR placebo patients , with a 
2-sided alpha level of 0.025 .  
For the TTR percent change from Baseline , it is observed that the NEURO -TTR placebo group 
had 9.7% reduction from Baseline  to Week  65.  It is estimated that the ION -682884 -treated 
group will have at least 80% reduction from Baseline .  The standard deviation is estimated to be 
13%.  There would be at least 95% power to detect a 70.3% difference in the percent change 
from Baseline  betw een ION-682884 -treated patients and the NEURO -TTR -placebo patients , 
with a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 .  
10.3. Populations  
The population definitions that will be used in this study are provided below and are very similar 
to those employed in the NEURO -TTR trial.   
Full Analysis Set:  All randomized patients who received at least 1 injection of ION -682884 or 
inotersen and who have a Baseline  and at least 1 post-Baseline  efficacy assessment for mNIS+7 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
77  score or Norfolk QOL -DN questionnaire total score .  For NEURO -TTR trial, t he Full Analysis 
Set includes all randomized patients who received at least 1 injection of Study Drug (ino tersen or 
placebo) and who have a Baseline  and at least 1 post-Baseline  efficacy assessment for the 
mNIS+7 score or Norfolk QOL -DN questionnaire total score . 
Per Protocol Set:  A subset of Full Analysis Set who received at least a certain percentage of the  
prescribed doses of ION‑682884  and that have no significant protocol deviations that would be 
expected to affect efficacy assessments.  The detailed criteria will be specified in the SAP.   For 
NEURO -TTR trial, t he Per -Protocol Set includes the subset of the NEURO -TTR  Full Analysis 
Set who have received at least 80% of the prescribed doses of Study Drug (inotersen or placebo) 
and who have no major protocol violations that would be expected to affect efficacy 
assess ments.   
Safety Set:  All patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of ION -682884 or 
inotersen.  For NEURO -TTR trial, the Safety Set includes all randomized patients who received 
at least 1 injection of Study Drug (inotersen or placebo).  
PK P opulation:  All patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of ION -682884 or 
inotersen and have at least 1 evaluable PK sample.  
10.4. Definition of Baseline  
The same Baseline  definitions from the NEURO -TTR trial will be applied in this study.  The 
Baseline  for efficacy, PD and safety assessments will be defined as follows:  
• Baseline  mNIS+7 and its individual components will be defined as the average of 
2 assessments taken within 60 days prior to the first dose of ION -682884 or inotersen.  
If only one a ssessment has been done, the single assessment will be used in place of the 
average.  Rarely, for patient convenience, the Baseline  mNIS+7 assessment(s) (or a 
subset of this assessment) will have been completed early in the Treatment Period  rather 
than pre -treatment.  These will be considered protocol deviations.  These assessments 
will be included in the analysis as valid Baseline  assessments provided they are taken 
within 1 week after the first dose.   The rationale for this is that the pha rmacology of the 
drug indicates that the drug will have no effect on mNIS+7 this early in treatment, and 
including these values as the Baseline  assessments will allow these patient’s data to be 
included in the primary analysis.    
• Baseline  NSC and individua l components will be defined as the average of 2 assessments 
taken within 60 days prior to the first dose of ION -682884 or inotersen.   If only 
1 assessment has been done, the single assessment will be used in place of the average.  
Because NSC score is col lected during the NIS assessment procedure , it is possible it 
could be completed early in the Treatment Period  rather than pre -treatment.   These will 
be considered protocol deviations.  These assessments will be included in the analysis as 
valid Baseline  assessments , provided they are taken within 1 week after the first dose.  
• Baseline  ECG will be defined as the average of the triplicate taken on Day 1 pre-dose.  
If only 1 or 2 assessments are available, the single assessment or average of the 
2 assessments will be used.   If the case that Day 1 pre-dose ECG is missing, screening 
visit results will be used as Baseline .  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
78  • Baseline  laboratory assessment including PD will be defined as the average of all 
non-missing pre -dose assessments.  
Baseline  for all other assessments will be defined as the last non -missing value prior to the first 
dose of study drug (ION -682884 or inotersen).  
10.5. Interim Analysis and Multip licity  
An interim analysis will be performed to assess the efficacy and safety profile of ION-682884 
comparing to the placebo arm of Neuro -TTR when all patients on ION -682884 complete 
Week  35 assessments.  
Week 35 Interim Analysis  
The multip licity  will be controlled by using the ranking strategy in the following testing 
sequence:  
• Interim Anal ysis PEP.  Comparison of percent change from Baseline  to Week 35 in the 
TTR between ION-682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo  in the Full Analysis Set.  
• Interim Analysis PEP.  Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 35 in the mNIS+7 
between ION-682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo  in the Full Analysis Set.  
• Interim Analysis Secondary Endpoint.  Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week  35 
in the Norfolk total score between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full 
Analysis Set.   
The statistical analysis will be  conducted with 2-sided alpha level of 0.025.  If any of the 
endpoint is not statistically significant, the remaining test(s) will not be conducted in the interim 
analysis.  
Week 66 Final Analysis  
The multip licity  for the final analysis will be controlled b y using the ranking strategy in the 
following testing sequence:  
• Co-Primary Endpoint :  Comparison of percent change from Baseline  to Week 65 in the 
TTR between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set   
• Co-Primary Endpoint :  Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 66 in the mNIS+7 
between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set   
• Co-Primary Endpoint :  Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 66 in the Norfolk 
total score between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the  Full Analysis Set  
• Secondary Endpoint :  Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 66 in the NSC 
between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set  
• Secondary Endpoint:  Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 35 in the NSC 
between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set  
• Secondary Endpoint:  Comparison of change from Baseline  in the PCS score of SF -36 at 
Week 65 between ION -682884 or NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
79  • Seconda ry Endpoint:  Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 65 in the PND 
between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set  
• Week 66 Final Analysis Secondary Endpoin t:  Comparison of change from Baseline  to 
Week 65 in mBMI between ION -682884 an d NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis 
Set  
In the Week 66 Final Analysis, for those statistically significant endpoints at Week  35 Interim 
Analysis, their corresponding tests at the Week 66 Final Analysis will not be conducted in the 
ranking strategy fo r multiplicity.  The first test will be for the endpoint which is not statistically 
significant at the Week 35 Interim Analysis.  The alpha level for this endpoint will be determined 
by the resampling procedure (Westfall and Young 1993 ) as follows.  
Let T1 and T2 be the standardized test statistics at the interim and final analyses, respectively.  In 
order to determine the alpha level for the final an alysis, the correlation between T1 and T2 is first 
estimated based on the resampling approach:  
• Among the 108 ION -682884 treated patients and 52 NEURO -TTR placebo patients, 
randomly assign 108 patients to the ION -682884 treated group and 52 patients to 
NEURO -TTR placebo group  
• Apply the re -randomized treatment assignment to the interim data and obtain the 
standardized test statistics T1  
• Apply the re -randomized treatment assignment to the final data and obtain the 
standardized test statistics T2  
Repeat the above procedure N times (N  = 10000) and obtain N pairs of test statistics T1 and T2.  
The correlation between T1 and T2 will then be estimated as the sample correlation of the 
N pairs.  
Let c1 be the cut -off point for the interim 2-sided test correspon ding to an alpha of 0.025.   Once 
the estimated correlation ρ is available, the cut -off point c2 for the final analysis is obtained by 
solving the nonlinear equation Pr(|T1| ≥ c1 or |T2| ≥ c2) =  0.05, where (T1, T2) follow a bivariate 
normal distribution wi th mean vector (0, 0), standard deviations of 1 and correlation ρ.  
For those endpoints that are not tested in the interim analysis, significant level of 0.05 will be 
used in the final analysis.  
10.6. Planned Methods of Analysis  
All eCRF data, lab data transfers , mNIS+7 score data, as well as any outcomes derived from the 
data, will be provided in the patient data listings.  Patient data listings will be presented for all 
patients enrolled into the study.   
Descriptive summary statistics including n, mean, median , standard deviation, interquartile range 
(25th percentile, 75th percentile), and range (minimum, maximum) for continuous variables, and 
counts and percentages for categorical variables will be used to summarize most data by 
treatment group.  Where appropr iate, p -values will be reported.  All statistical tests will be 
conducted using 2 -sided tests with 5% Type I error rates unless otherwise stated.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0
ION-682884 -CS3 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
80  All primary, secondary and PD endpoints will be assessed on the Full Analysis Set and 
Per-Protocol Set, with the former being the basis for the primary efficacy analysis.  All safety 
assessments will be performed on the Safety Set.   PK endpoints will be assessed in the PK Set as 
applicable.  
The reference arm (inotersen) will be summarized descriptively and no st atistical comparison 
will be made between the reference arm and the ION-682884 -treated arm .  
10.6.1.  Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographic and Baseline  characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics by 
treatment group.  All patients  enrolled will be included in a summary of patient disposition.  
10.6.2.  Efficacy Analysis  
10.6.2.1.  Primary Analysis  
10.6.2.1.1.  Primary Analysis at Interim Analysis  
Below are the 2 primary analyses for interim analysis  
• Comparison of percent change from Baseline  to Week 35 in the TTR  between 
ION-682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set  
• Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 35 in the mNIS+7 between 
ION-682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set  
The percent change in TTR from Baseline  to Week 35 will be analyzed using the Mixed Effects 
Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) model adjusted by propensity score weights.  The 
MMRM model will also include the effects of treatment (ION -682884 or NEURO -TTR 
placebo), time (categorical), disease s tage (Stage 1/Stage 2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), previous 
treatment (Yes/No), treatment -by-time interaction, baseline  value of the endpoint, and the 
baseline -by-time interaction.  The propensity score will be calculated for each NEURO -TTR 
placebo or ION -682884 patient using a logistic regression model with Baseline  covariates 
including disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), and previous treatment 
(Yes/No).  
The second PEP mNIS+7 is scheduled to be assessed at Week 35, Week 66, and Week 85.  
Because only 1 post-Baseline  assessment (Week 35) is available at Week 35 Interim Analysis, 
the treatment comparison at Week 35 will be based on the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model adjusted by propensity score.  The ANCOVA model will also include th e effects of 
treatment (ION -682884 or NEURO -TTR placebo), disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2), V30M 
mutation (Yes/No), previous treatment (Yes/No), and the Baseline  value of the endpoint.  
Patients with a missing mNIS+7 at Week 35 will have value multiply impu ted using an 
imputation model that contains the following variables:  disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2), V30M 
mutation (Yes/No), previous treatment (Yes/No), and the Baseline  value of the endpoint and the 
multiple imputation will be stratified by treatment g roup (Schafer 1997 ; Schafer 1999 ).  Any 
patient who discontinues early from the Treatment Period  will be strongly encouraged to 
complete landmark assessments.  682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

The secondary analysis at interim analysis is th e comparison of change from Baseline  to 
Week  35 in the Norfolk total score between ION -682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo in the 
Full Analysis Set.  The analysis will be conducted in the same way as for the mNIS+7 in the 
Week 35 Interim Analysis.  
10.6.2.2.2.  Secondary Analysis at Final Analysis  
The secondary endpoints at Week 66 Final Analysis include the following analyses:   
• Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 66 in the NSC between ION -682884

• Comparison of change from Baseline  in the PCS score of SF -36 at Week 65 between 
ION-682884 or NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set  
• Comparison of ch ange from Baseline  to Week 65 in the PND between ION -682884 
and NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set.  
• Comparison of change from Baseline  to Week 65 in mBMI between ION -682884 and 
NEURO -TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set  
The secondary analyses wil l be conducted in the same way as for the primary analysis at 
Week  66 Final Analysis.  
10.6.2.3.  Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
Pharmacodynamic analyses include comparisons of change from Baseline  in TTR between 
ION-682884 and NEURO -TTR placebo group.   The data will be analyzed in the same way as for 
the PEP at Week 66 Final Analysis .

Exploratory analysis includes the comparisons of change from Baseline  in ECHO parameters, at 
Week 66 and NT-proBNP at Week 65 between ION -682884 or the NEURO -TTR placebo group.  
Additional analyses on the all cause hospitalizations in all patients at Week 66, all cause 
hospitalizations in patients with cardiac involvement at Week 66, mNIS+7 and Norfolk 
QOL -DN at Week 85, 10MWT , R-ODS , COMPASS -31 and EQ -5D-5L at Week s 37 and  81 will

82  clinical outcome assessment measures. Details of exploratory  analys es will be provided in the 
SAP.  
10.6.3.  Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenici ty Analysis  
10.6.3.1.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Noncompartmental PK analysis of ION -682884 (as total full -length oligonucleotides, including 
fully, partially, and un -conjugated ION -682884) or inotersen will be carried out on each 
individual patient data set in the PK subgroup where limited intensive plasma PK samples are 
collected following the dose on Days 1, 225, and 449.  The maximum observed drug 
concentration (C max) and the t ime taken to reach C max (Tmax) will be obtained directly from the 
concentration -time data.  Partial areas under the plasma concentration  time- curve from time zero 
(pre-dose) to the last observable concentration (AUC 0-t) after SC administration will be 
calculated using the linear -up logdown - trapezoidal method.   
For all evaluable patients receiving ION -682884 or inotersen, plasma drug concentrations during 
the Treatment Period  and at the Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period will be listed by treatment, 
dose, study  day, time point, patient ID, patient anti -drug antibody (ADA) status, and summarized 
using descriptive statistics, with and without stratification by patient immunogenicity status.  The 
apparent plasma terminal elimination half -life of ION -682884 or inote rsen following the last 
administered dose will be calculated in each evaluable patient with post -treatment PK samples 
collected (when deemed possible by the PK scientist).  
Plasma PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics, with and witho ut 
stratification by patient immunogenicity status.  Other PK parameters, as appropriate, may be 
determined or calculated at the discretion of the PK scientist.  Additional details regarding the 
PK analysis will be described in the SAP.  
Potential relations hips between selected PD and plasma exposure measures (e.g., trough 
concentrations) may also be explored, where deemed appropriate.  
10.6.3.2.  Immunogenicity Analysis  
ADA will be determined in a multi -tiered approach that includes screening, confirmation, and 
titrati on (if confirmed positive) assays at Baseline , during treatment, and at the end of Follow -Up 
Period  for all patients (receiving either ION -682884 or inotersen) in the study.  Immunogenicity 
results (screen positive/negative, confirmed positive/negative or not evaluable, and when 
applicable, titer of ADA) before, during, and after treatment with ION -682884 or inotersen 
(i.e., sample ADA status) will be listed.   Patient ADA status (positive/negative or not evaluable) 
for all evaluable patients, along with the  study day that the first positive immunogenicity status 
emerged (T first, i.e., onset of ADA development), the last positive immunogenicity status 
observed (T last), the last ADA sample collection day, and peak titer if applicable, will be listed by 
their t reatment and study day.  Patients with positive ADA status may be further classified 
(where applicable) as being either ‘persistent’, ‘transient’, or ‘not determinable’, if deemed 
appropriate.  
Additionally, the sample and patient immunogenicity incidence ( number) and incidence rate 
(percent) will be summarized as the total number and percent of evaluated patients with antibody 682884-CS3 Protocol Amendment 5-12Aug2021-ROW | 1.0

Protocol   12 August 2021  
 
83  negative, positive, and unknown status by treatment and dose.  Furthermore, onset, titer over 
time, and peak titer of the ADA respon se, if applicable, will be summarized as median, quartiles 
(25% and 75%), and range by treatment and dose.  
Potential effect of immunogenicity on efficacy and safety will be evaluated.  Additional details 
regarding the IM data analysis will be described in the SAP.  
10.6.4.  Safety Analysis  
Treatment duration and amount of ION -682884 or inotersen received will be summarized by 
treatment group, as well as reasons for any withdrawals from ION -682884 or inotersen.  
All treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs with onset after the first dose of ION -682884 or 
inotersen) and SAE s will be summarized for each treatment group using the MedDRA™ coding 
system, by system organ class, preferred term, relationship to ION -682884 o r inotersen, and 
severity.   Narratives of deaths, SAE s, including early withdrawals from ION -682884 or inotersen 
and from study due to AEs, will also be provided.  
Laboratory tests to ensure patient safety including chemistry panel, complete blood count (CBC) 
with differential, coagulation panel, etc., will be summarized by study visits for each treatment 
group.   These safety variables will also be presented as change and percent change from Baseline  
over time after ION -682884 or inotersen administration,  as appropriate.  
Vital sign and ECG measures will be tabulated.  In addition, the number of patients who 
experience abnormalities in clinical laboratory evaluations will be summarized.  
11. INVESTIGATOR’S REGUL ATORY OBLIGATIONS  
11.1. Informed Consent  
The written inf ormed consent document should be prepared in the language(s) of the potential 
patient population, based on an English version provided by the Sponsor.  
Before a patient’s participation in the trial, the Investigator is responsible for obtaining written 
informed consent from the patient after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated 
benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific screening 
procedures or any ION‑682884  or inotersen are administered.  The patient must be given

3 Full physical exam to be given at Screening and abbreviated physical exam to be given during Treatment and Post  
Treatment - Period as indicated to assess changes from Screening.  
4 The mNIS+7 assessment procedure includes:   NIS, QST, HRDB and pre -determined  sensory and nerve conduction 
testing.  Additional clinical evaluations done during mNIS+7 assessment include:   Lower Limbs Function Test (LLF) 
and NSC.  Two (2) independent mNIS+7 assessments will be performed at  selected visits  on separate days .  Both 
Baseline mNIS+7  assessments should be performed within 21 days prior to the first dose of ION -682884 or inotersen 
(Day  1).  In addition, every effort should be made to conduct the 2 assessments < 7 days apart.  
 For an individual patient, every effort should be made to use the same mNIS+7 evaluator throughout the study and the 
evaluator must be insulated from the patient’s general study procedures and knowledge of the patient’s AEs.  Norfolk 
QOL -DN must be administered prior to any other study procedures.  At Baseline and Week 66, the Norfolk QOL -DN 
can be administered on the same day as the first mNIS+7 assessment.   
5 Transthoracic ECHO can be completed with ± 21-day window around Week 3 5, 66, 85 and 105 visits.  
6 For determination of patient eligibility o nly if appropriate documentation is not available.   
7 Screening Labs include FSH (for confirmation of menopause as per Inclusion Criteria 3 ii), HIV, HBV and HCV, 
SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation, serum free light chain ratio, and HbA1C per Appendix B.  
8 Conducted only in women who are of child -bearing potential per Inclusion Criterion 3 iv.  Pregnancy test should be 
conducted on serum or plasma samples at Screening and during in -clinic visits.  During visits at home, pregnancy test 
can be conducted on urine or serum/plasma.   However, on Day 1, pregnancy test should be conducted by urine as wel l 
as serum/plasma so that a negative urine test is available prior to dosing.  
9 If chemistry, hematology or urinalysis  results are uninterpretable (e.g., due to clumping, hemolysis or quantity not 
sufficient) or missing , a repeat sample  should be collected  as soon as possible (ideally within 7  days).  The window for 
sample collections that occur outside clinic visits is ± 4 days.  See Section  8.5 for gu idance on ION -682884 or 
inotersen dosing relative to chemistry, hematology or urinalysis  monitoring. After the last dose (Week 81), monitoring  
should be performed  every 4 weeks for 8 weeks (until Week 89, inclusive), either by Chemistry, Hematology or 
Urinalysis  panel or by Abbreviated Monitoring panel.  
10  Collection of laboratory samples for vitamin A/Retinol testing should precede the ingestion of vitamin A supplement 
for that day.  
11  Stored at least at -70 °C for follow -up exploration of PD, labora tory findings (including disease biomarkers not 
specified in this protocol) and/or AEs (e.g., measurement of cytokine and/or chemokine levels, measurement of 
additional markers of kidney function, measurement of antibodies, etc.) in this or subsequent clin ical studies of 
ION-682884.  
12  The collection of the blood sample for potential follow up exploration of laboratory findings, AE, or disease 
progression in this or subsequent clinical studies of ION 682884 (not for genetic research) is expected for all pa tients, 
collection can only proceed if supported by local regulations and after patient consent  
13  The window of drug administration is ± 1 week for ION -682884, and ± 4 days for inotersen.  
14  On Weeks 5, 9, and 33, in -clinic visits are encouraged but no t mandated.   If in-clinic visit is not done, Investigator  
must communicate with patients by phone or telemedicine tools where available to go over concomitant medications, 
AEs/SAEs and their general health.  Physical exam may be skipped per Investigator  judgment.   A home health  care 
provider can collect lab samples, VS, and ensure proper dosing of the Study Drug. If not in -clinic, PK and 
immunogenicity samples may be skipped.   If patient is part of PK subset, then Week 33 is mandatory to be in -clinic.  
15  ECG before first dose can be performed and assessed by Investigator  anytime between Screening up to Day 1 visit as 
long as it is performed before the first dose.  
16 If results are  uninterpretable (e.g., due to clumping, hemolysis or quantity not sufficient ) or missing, a repeat sample  
should be collected  as soon as possible (ideally within 7  days).  The window for sample  collections that occur outside 
clinic visits is ± 4 days.  See Section  8.5 for guidance on ION -682884 or inotersen dosing relative to platelet 
monitoring. After the last dose of inotersen (Week 34), monitoring should be performed every 2 weeks for 8 weeks 
(until Week 42, inclusive), eithe r by Chemistry, Hematology or Urinalysis panel or by Abbreviated Monitoring panel.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1
 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ION -682884 after administration 
for 65 weeks, as compared to the historical control of the placebo cohort in the ISIS  420915- CS2 
(NEURO- TTR) trial, based on the change from Baseline in serum transthyretin (TTR) 
concentration, modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7), and in the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire —Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL -DN) in pati ents with hereditary 
transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR -PN). 
An interim analysis will be conducted at Week 35. The interim analysis will be performed when all patients on ION -682884 complete Week 35 assessments, and will assess the efficacy (TTR, 
mNIS+7, Norfolk) compared to the placebo arm of the NEURO- TTR  trial.  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

subgroup); and t ½λz for patients who do not roll over to the OLE study. 
 
3.3  Trial Design Considerations  
3.3.1 Background  
ION- 682884 is a ligand -conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (LICA), specifically a second-
generation 2′-MOE of twenty (20) nucleotides (i.e., a 20- mer) that are connected sequentially by 
phosphorothioate and phosphate diester internucleotide linkages and c onjugated at the 5′  end to a 
triantennary N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) moiety. GalNAc conjugation enhances the uptake 
of ASOs to hepatocytes, and thereby increases the potency of ASOs in humans up to approximately 
30-fold. The strategy for treatment of transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) with 
systemically delivered ION -682884 is  to reduce levels of mutated and wild -type TTR protein 
secreted by the liver. This strategy has been validated by the successful Phase 2/3 NEURO -TTR 
study of Tegsedi (inoter sen), an unconjugated 2′ -MOE PS ASO which shares ION-682884’ s 
nucleotide sequence, which demonstrated improvement in the course of neurologic disease and quality of life in patients with stage 1 and stage 2 hereditary ATTR with polyneuropathy (hATTR -
PN). 
Currently, two products are approved globally for the treatment of hATTR -PN: Tegsedi 
(inotersen), and Onpattro (patisiran), an RNAi product which also reduces levels of TTR protein, and which is administered intravenously. A third product, Vyndaqel (tafamidis), a tetrameric TTR stabilizer, is approved in some countries for treatment of symptomatic stage 1 hATTR -PN patients. 
Treatment with inotersen is associated with risks of severe thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis. 
In light of hATTR’s status as a rare disease, as well as the current highly competitive environment 
for recruitment of hATTR patients, the sponsor’s objective is to conduct a pivotal registration study which represents a scientifically valid assessment of ION -682884’s clinical efficacy in t reatment 
of hATTR -PN, while also being sufficiently appealing to patients to both accrue the study within 
a reasonable time frame and retain all subjects throughout the treatment period. The concurrent reference cohort of patients receiving open -label inot ersen in ION -682884- CS3 will be 
descriptively compared to the historical inotersen cohort of NEURO -TTR to validate efficacy 
comparisons between the two studies. 
3.3.2 Risks of bias and mitigation of bias  
Externally controlled studies face important risks of bias .  The design of the present study aims to 
mitigate these risks as follows, considering the framework provided by Pocock 1976 and E10

control data from another trial. This design has several limitations compared to a double -blind, 
randomized, placebo -controlled trial. An open- label trial is subject to more bias when compared to 
a blinded trial, and data from two trials performed at different times lea ds to questions of the 
validity of such a comparison. The sponsor acknowledges these limitations, but believes this is a 
unique situation in which comparison to historical control is justified.  
Firstly, the historical control data were collected in a rand omized, double -blinded, placebo -
controlled trial (NEURO -TTR) in the same disease population within the last 8 years by the same 
sponsor. The trial was accepted by multiple regulatory agencies and supported the approval of the 
drug inotersen. Secondly, as the study is being supported by many of the same sites and original study team members, similar mitigations and trial conduct will be employed in the current study. Finally, several measures have been instituted in the current trial to ensure the integrity of the trial conduct and validity of data comparison. They are listed below: 
Patient population:  
• Eligibility criteria are designed to mirror those in NEURO -TTR in defining hATTR -PN 
disease stage, age range, gender, exclusions of certain comorbidities, restriction of 
concomitant medications for hATTR and functional status. 
Sites and regions:  
• Sites that participated in NEURO -TTR are also participating in the current trial.  Additional 
sites and regions have been added to enhance enrollment; however, all of the selected sites have experience with hATTR disease management. Since this is a rare disease, participating clinicians are generally active in international congresses in which practice guidance and experiences are exchanged and aligned.   
• Oversight of sites by the study team, especially the new sites not involved in NEURO -TTR, 
will ensure that the trial conduct is as similar as possible to NEURO -TTR.  
 
Primary endpoint evaluation comparison.  The primary endpoint evaluation is consistent be tween the NEURO- TTR and ION -682884- CS3 
studies. Measures have been taken to maximize the validity of the comparison. The primary 
endpoints of mNIS+7 and Norfolk QOL -DN will be masked to the sponsor team responsible for 
oversight of the study. A ny team members that become unblinded at the time of interim analysis 
will be replaced with blinded team members.  Further details are described in the Unblinding and 
Data Access Plan .  Similarly to NEURO -TTR, the mNIS+7 central reader at PNRL, Mayo Clinic, 
will be blinded to treatment assignment. All mNIS+7 assessors will be blinded to the rest of trial conduct. For mNIS+7 evaluation, the conduct of the primary endpoint assessment is similar to NEURO- TTR, i.e., mNIS+7 assessors will be trained and certified by Dr. Pet er Dyck, a neurologist 
at PNRL, Mayo Clinic, who created the composite score. Dr. Dyck’s team will be the central reader 
to review and normalize the results.  Pharmacodynamic markers will be blinded to sites and 
patients.

in open- label designs.  To assess this risk for key outcome measures, we visually inspected the 
effect of inotersen on changes in mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL during the double -blind period in 
NEURO- TTR, and crossover from placebo to open- label inotersen in the NEURO -TTR OLE study 
(see figures below ).  Open -label bias was not visually evident  based on the fact that the slope of 
disease progression is similar before and after the change to open label . Furthermore, although 
participants are not blinded to treatment assignment, the primary outcome assessments of serum 
TTR reduction and mNIS+7 scores are largely objective, and no formal statistical comparison will be made between the reference inotersen ar m and the ION -682884- treated arm.  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

moved to OAEI and replaced with glomerulonephritis AESI, a cardiac OAEI has been added.  
The complement activation was removed  because using the hypersensitivity SMQ was not very 
specific to compliment activation and in NEURO-TTR did not show any differences from placebo. The Cardiac OAEI uses standard MedDRA terms so can be applied to both the ION -
682844 and comparator arms consistently 
Baseline factor adjustment.   The following baseline factors will be used in the prop ensity score 
for baseline factor adjustment based on the NEURO -TTR analysis: disease stage, previous 
treatment, and V30M mutation. In addition to the three factors used in the primary analyses, some 
sensitivity analyses may include the following factors in the logistic model for the propensity score.     
• Gender (Male, Female)  
• Modified BMI baseline (continuous value)  
• Region (Europe, North America, South America/Australasia /Asia ) 
For the MMRM and ANCOVA analyses, baseline result of  the endpoint will be used as  the 
covariate, if applicable.  
 
4 STATISTICAL MET HODS  
4.1 Data Management and Quality Assurance 
ICON plc ( nee PRA) has been contracted to provide Data Management services for this study. As 
part of the contract, ICON (nee PRA)  is responsible for creating the Medidata RAVE Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) data entry screens, database and edit checks using definitions developed 
together with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In addition to database development, ICON (nee PRA)  
is also resp onsible for the clinical database maintenance throughout the course of the study (i.e., 
amendments), as well as for the review, data management querying, and locking of the database. 
Data are single- entered into the EDC system by the investigator site staff. Programmed edit checks 
(computer logic that checks the validity of the data entered and also prompts for missing data that 
are expected to be entered) are run at the time of data entry within EDC, and automatic queries are generated. ICON (nee PRA)  revi ews all data for accuracy and validity and generates additional 
manual queries in the EDC system when necessary. The data are corrected, or an explanation concerning the query is provided in the EDC system and saved in the audit trail. 
Exceptions for data entry are protocol deviations entered by the ICON (nee PRA)  monitors, and 
mNIS+7 data, which are entered into the EDC by an independent contract research group, the Mayo 
Clinic Polyneuropathy Quality Assurance Core Facility (MC Core), which is under the di rection 
of Dr. Peter Dyck. These mNIS+7 eCRFs are restricted from review by both ICON (nee PRA)  and 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Note that the CNA Booklet data at the Screening Visit is available for review by both ICON (nee PRA)  and Ionis Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.).  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

management (TRENNIC Data Services) will have access to the post -baseline mNIS+7, NSC, 
Norfolk -QOL -DN. This data manager will not communicate or discu ss the firewall ed data with the 
rest of Ionis team .  
After all data are entered, reviewed, and queried, the database is closed and sent to the statistics 
group for review and for identification of significant protocol deviations. After any further queries that arose from this review are resolved, the database is locked. Database interim locks will be done at Week 35, Week 66,  and after all patients have completed the EOT assessments. The final data base lock will be performed after all subjects complete the study, and is referred to as the end of study (EOS) final lock. Further details can be found in the Data Management Plan.

All tables will present the population frequencies in each treatment group and/or subgroup (where 
appropriate) and will indicate the number of subjects with non-missing data and the denominators for percentages.    
Continuous data will be summarized in ter ms of the mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error 
(SE), median, interquartile range (25th percentile [P25], 75th percentile [P75]), range (minimum, 
maximum) and number of observations, unless otherwise stated. The minimum and maximum will 
be reported to the same number of decimal places as the raw data recorded in the database. The 
mean, median, lower quartile, upper quartile, least squares means and difference in least squares means will be reported to one more decimal place than the raw data recorded in the database. The SD and SE will be reported to two more decimal places than the raw data recorded in the database. In general, the maximum number of decimal places reported shall be four for any summary statistic. All raw values presented in listings will be displayed to the measured precision.   
Categorical data will be summarized in terms of the number of subjects providing data at the 
relevant time point (n), frequency counts and percentages.  Any planned collapsing of categories will be detailed in the text and the data displays.   
Age will be presented in years. Weight will be presented in kg. Height will be presented in cm. 
Temperature will be presented in °C. Laboratory values will be summarized using standard units. 
Percentages will be presented to one decimal place and not be presented for zero counts. 
Percentages will be calculated using n as the denominator.   
Changes from Baseline in categorical data will be summarized using shift tables where appropriate.  
P-values greater than or equal to 0.001, in general, will be presented to three decimal places.  P -
values less than 0.001 will be presented as “<0.001”. All statistical tests will be conducted using 
2-sided tests with 5% Type I error rates, unless otherwise stated.  
Confidence intervals will  be presented to one more decimal place than the raw data.  
Summaries of plasma drug concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters will include typical descriptive statistics, such as n, mean, SD, SE, percent Coefficient of Variation (%CV), geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum.   
All eCRF data, lab data transfers, mNIS+7 score data, as well as any outcomes derived from the 
data, will be provided in the patient data listings. Patient data listings will be presented for all patients enro lled into the study. 
All primary, secondary and PD endpoints will be assessed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and Per -
Protocol Set (PPS), with the former being the basis for the primary efficacy analysis. All safety assessments will be performed on the Safety Set (SS). PK endpoints will be assessed in the PK Set as applicable.  
The reference arm (inotersen) will be summarized descriptively with the NEURO -TTR inotersen 
arm.  No formal statistical comparison will be made between the reference arm and the ION -
682884- treated arm.  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

All tables and figures containing efficacy and PD endpoints will indicate whether they present raw data or adjusted resul ts from the statistical model, with footnotes indicating the model used and 
covariates included in the model.   
All tables, figures, and data listings to be included in the report will be independently checked for

All the missing visit or missing data related to COVID -19 will be listed.  Additional listings will 
be provided for the patients’ assessments with COVID -19 impact.  Additional summary will be 
provided if deemed necessary.    4.2.1 Baseline  
4.2.1.1 Baseline for ION -682884 and inotersen 
The same Baseline definitions as in the NEURO -TTR trial will be applied in this study. The 
Baseline for efficacy, PD, and safety assessments will be defined as follows:  
• Baseline mNIS+7 and its individual components will be defined as the average of 2 
assessments taken within 60 days prior to the first dose of ION -682884 or inotersen. If only 
one assessment has been done, the single assessment will be used in place of the average. 
Rarely, for patient convenience, the Baseline mNIS+7 assessment(s) (or a subset of this assessment) will have been completed early in the Treatment Period rather than pre-
treatment. These will be considered protocol deviations. These assessments will be 
included in the a nalysis as valid Baseline assessments, provided they are taken within 1 
week after the first dose. The rationale for this is that the pharmacology of the drug indicates that the drug will have no effect on mNIS+7 this early in treatment, and including thes e 
values as the Baseline assessments will allow these patient’s data to be included in the primary analysis. 
• Baseline NSC and individual components will be defined as the average of 2 assessments 
taken within 60 days prior to the first dose of ION -682884 or inotersen. If only 1 assessment 
has been done, the single assessment will be used in place of the average. Because NSC 
score is collected during the NIS assessment procedure, it is possible it could be completed early in the Treatment Period rather than pre-treatment. These will be considered protocol 
deviations. These assessments will be included in the analysis as valid Baseline assessments provided they are taken within 1 week after the first dose. 
• Baseline ECG will be defined as the value taken on Day  1 pre -dose. If the triplicates are 
taken, the average of the triplicates will be used.  If only 1 or 2 assessments are available, the single assessment or average of the 2 assessments will be used. If the case that Day 1 pre-dose ECG is missing, screening  visit results will be used as Baseline.  
• Baseline for numerical laboratory assessment including PD will be defined as the average of all non- missing pre -dose assessments.  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

dose of study drug (ION-682884 or inotersen). 
Of note, for re -consented and re- screened patients, only records after re-screening will be used 
for Baseline.  
 4.2.1.2 ION-682884 Baseline for patients received inotersen at the beginning of study and 
scheduled to switch to ION -682884 at Week 37  
ION- 682884 baseline will be defined as the last non -missing assessment prior to the first dose of 
ION-682884.   4.2.2 Definitions and Computational Formulas  
The same on- treatment period definitions as in the NEURO- TTR trial for efficacy and PD data will 
be applied in this study.  
• Day 1 will refer to the day of the first dose of study drug.  
• For efficacy endpoints except for BMI and mBMI: 
o The efficacy on -treatment period spans the time during which the study treatment is 
administered until 52 days after the last dose of medication.   
o The efficacy post -treatment period starts on the day after the efficacy on -treatment period 
and ends on the day of the pati ent’s last contact date within the study.  
• For BMI, mBMI, and PD endpoints: 
o The on- treatment period spans the time during which the study treatment is administered 
until 28 days after the last dose of medication.  
o The post -treatment period starts on the day  after the on -treatment period and ends on the 
day of the patient’s last contact date within the study.  
• For safety endpoints, the safety period spans the time drug is first administered until the day of 
the patient’s last contact date within the study.  
• The PK and Immunogenicity (IM) on- study period spans the time drug is administered until 
the day of the patient’s last contact date within the study.  
• Note: Assessments for mNIS+7, and NSC done early in the treatment period that are used for 
baseline cannot also be used as an on -treatment assessment.  
• Body mass index (BMI) will be computed using the formula: 
      BMI = (weight in kilograms) / [height in cm / 100]
2 
• mBMI will be computed from BMI and serum albumin levels by: 
                      mBMI = BMI * serum albumin (g/L).  
 
4.2.3 Analysis Visit Windows  
For 682884- CS3 study, the efficacy and PD data will be assigned to a visit according to the visit 
windows in the table below. Efficacy assessments that occurred more than 52 days after the last 
dose of study drug will not be included in the efficacy analys es/summaries during the efficacy on -
treatment period, even if they occur within one of the visit windows. PD assessments , as well as 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

The Per Protocol Set is defined as those patients from the FAS who received at least 80% of prescribed injections of ION‑682884 or inotersen and who have no significant protocol deviations that would be expected to affect efficacy assessments. The PPS will be defined separately for Week 
35 interim analysis and Week 66 final analysis. The Week 35 interim analysis PPS will use only data up to week 35 while the Week 66 final analysis PPS will use al l data up to Week 66.  
Summary of reasons for patients excluded from PPS will be provided.  Results will be summarized under the treatment to which the patients were randomized.  
4.5.5 Safety Set   
The Safety Set (SS) will be defined as all patients who are random ized and receive at least 1 dose

The following summary and listing will be provided: 
Patient demographic characteristics and Baseline severity of illness will be summarized by 
treatment group and overall for the Randomized Set, SS, FAS, PPS, and PK Set. Patient demographic characteristics, including age, age group (<65 years, 65- 74 years, >=75 years), sex, 
race, ethnicity, country of site, TTR genotype  category , duration of disease from hATTR -PN 
diagnosis (months), and duration from onset of hATTR -PN symptoms (months), criteria  used to 
document the diagnosis of TTR cardiomyopathy (FAC), duration of disease from FAC diagnosis (months), and duration from onset of FAC symptoms (months), previous treatment and disease stage will be summarized by treatment group and overall for the S S, FAS, PPS, and PK subgroup. 
Baseline severity of illness, including the NIS score, mNIS+7, PND score, serum TTR, high-sensitivity Troponin T , mBMI, BMI, weight, height, NYHA, and NT -proBNP, will be summarized 
by treatment group and overall for the SS, FAS, PPS and PK subgroup. Measures of quality of life and level of functioning, including the baseline Norfolk QOL -DN total score and SF -36, will also 
be included. 
The TTR genotype category will be summarized by V30M vs . Non-V30M.  The V30M genotype 
category  includes V30M Mutation  (‘Yes’) and
 VAL50MET, V50M MUTATION, V50M and 
P.VAL50MET listed under the “Other” category  in CRF .   
The hATTR -PN/FAC diagnosis and onset date of hATTR -PN/FAC symptoms only collected year 
and month information in CRF. To facilitate the calculation of duration, the following imputation 
rules will be applied:  
• If year is missing, no imputation will be performed.   
• Day will be imputed as 01. 
• If month is missing and the recorded year is before the year in informed consent date,  the 
missing month will be imputed to be December; otherwise, it will be imputed as the month 
from the informed consent date.  
A by -patient listing of demographics will be presented based on the SS. This will include the year 
of birth, age (in years), sex, race, ethnicity, height (in cm), weight (in kg) and BMI. The body weight will be the measurement obtained at Screening.

provided in the data listings.  
In addition, the CRF has a page for medical history of interest prompt. All medical history of 
interest collected in this CRF will be listed.  
 
4.8 Concomitant Medication  
Medications will be coded using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification codes by 
WHODRUG Global B3 Mar2022 or later. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be defined using the start and stop dates, and ongoing fields 
recorded in the Case repo rt form (CRF) relative to the first and last dose dates of randomized study 
drug. A prior medication is defined as any medication taken up to, but not including the start date of study drug. A concomitant medication is defined as any medication taken whilst study drug is being taken.  
Note that if either of the start dates or stop dates of prior/concomitant medication are missing, the 
worst, i.e. most conservative, case will be considered when slotting medications (i.e., the medications should slot into all possible phases).  If a medication is administered pre- treatment or 
after first dose of study drug and no stop date/time is recorded, then usage will be assumed to be ongoing for the remainder of the data collection periods. If a medication is stopped on treatment or after first dose and no start date/time is recorded, it will be assumed that the medication was ongoing from prior to the start of study drug.  If a medication has no start or stop date, it will be assumed that the medication was ongoing from prior to the start of study drug. If a partial date is 
recorded in the case report form, the following convention will be used to assign the medication: 
• if the partial date is a start date, a '01' will be used for the day and 'Jan' will be used for the 
month  
• if the partial date is a stop date, a '28/29/30/31' will be used for the day (dependent on the 
month and year) and 'Dec' will be used for the month. 
The recorded partial date will be displayed in listings.  
The definitions for prior, concomitant medication defined relative to use of study drug are shown 
schematically in the diagram below.

4.10 Efficacy Evaluation 
4.10.1 Analysis and Data Conventions 
TTR  
As part of the primary analysis, TTR levels at both baseline and postdosing will be compared to 
the levels in the placebo arm of the NEURO -TTR trial. During the NEURO -TTR trial, TTR levels 
in human serum were measured using a validated commercial pre -albumin assay from Roche, using 
an immunoturbidometric method. In the ION -682884- CS3 trial, a novel electrochemiluminescence 
(ECL ) assay  has been developed and validated to measure TTR levels in human serum. In order  to 
enable valid cross- assay comparison of TTR levels from the two assays, a formula was created as 
part of cross -validation of the two methods, y=0.0057x^2 + 0.5843x - 0.3819 (data and derivation 
of the formula are provided in the method validation report  TTR -BRV02). Accordingly, the 
immunoturbidometric serum TTR level data from the placebo arm in the NEURO -TTR trial will 
be converted using the formula y=0.0057x^2 + 0.5843x - 0.3819 to allow comparison to data 
generated by the current ECL assay. The conver ted value of the placebo arm data will then be used 
in the primary analysis.   
mNIS+7  
The mNIS+7 consists of two composite scores: the NIS composite score (maximum of 244 points) and the modified +7 composite score (maximum of 102.32 points).   
NIS 
The NIS  composite score consists of 4 components:

All norms and scoring algorithms used will be based on the US population norms. 
PCS and MCS will be set to missing if the patient is missing  any  of the eight SF -36 scales.  
The scoring of the SF -36 will be conducted using the Quality Metric PRO CoRE  Smart 
Measurement System, PRO CoRE Version 2.1. 
NSC  
The NSC (version: 04Jan2009) questionnaire consists of one total score and five domains (muscle 
weakness, sensory (hypo/loss of sensation), sensory (paresthesia, hyper sensation), autonomic (gastrointest inal and urinary incontinence), and autonomic (non-GI/non- urinary incontinence)). 
The muscle weakness domain is divided into four sub- domains (head and neck, chest, upper limbs, 
and lower limbs). The scoring of the NSC questionnaire is described in  Appendix 6.2. 
10MWT 
The 10MWT is used to assess walking speed in meters per second (meter/second) over a short distance. It can be employed to assess functional mobility, gait, and vestibular function. The 10MWT can be done in two different ways:  comfortable gait speed, or fast walking speed. A lower score indicates worsening.  
The time is measured for the middle 6 m to allow for patient acceleration and deceleration:  
• the time is started when any part of the leading foot crosse s the plane of the 2 -meter mark;  
• the time is stopped when any part of the leading foot crosses the plane of the 8- meter mark.  
The total time taken to ambulate 6 meters (m) is recorded to the nearest hundredth of a second. 6 
m is then divided by the total time (in seconds) taken to ambulate. If a patient requires total assistance or is unable to ambulate at all, a score of 0 m/s should be documented.  
R-ODS  
The R -ODS is a 24 -item patient- reported outcome instrument and linearly weighted scale 
developed to mea sure the activity and social participation limitations in patients with Guillain -
Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, and gammopathy-related polyneuropathy. The response to each dimension is scored as: 0=not possible t o perform, 
1=possible but with some difficulty, 2=possible without any difficulty, and lower score indicates worsening disability. This method enables the use of sum scores by creating interval scales revealing the real difference in ability levels between  patients and within patients in time.  
If any of 24 items is missing, then the summed score will be set as missing.  
COMPASS -31 
COMPASS -31 is a 31- item questionnaire that evaluates autonomic function across 6 domains: 
orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, sec retomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder, and pupillomotor.  
Individual questions within domains inquire about symptom frequency (rarely to almost always), symptom severity (mild to severe), and symptom improvement (gotten much worse to completely gone).  
Quest ions include either “yes” or “present” will be scored as 1, “no” or “not present” scored as 0. 
All questions regarding the frequency of symptoms will be scored as 0 points for “rarely” or 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

and 3 points for “almost always” or “constantly”. All question s regarding the severity of symptoms 
will be scored as 1 point for “mild”, 2 points for “moderate”, and 3 points for “severe”. When assessing the time course of a symptom, will be scored 0 points for responses of representing 
improvement such as “gotten/getting somewhat better”, “gotten/getting much better”, “completely 
gone” and “I have not had any of these symptoms”, 1 point for “stayed about the same”, 2 points 
for “gotten/getting somewhat worse” and 3 points for “gotten/getting much worse.” The scores f or 
changes in bodily functions depended on the individual question asked. For example, “I get full a lot more quickly now than I used to when eating a meal” will be scored 2 points, “I get full more quickly now than I used to when eating a meal” will be score as 1 point, and “I get full less quickly now than I used to”, “I get full a lot less quickly now than I used to” will be scored 0 points, while the answer “I sweat somewhat more than I used to”, “I haven’t noticed any changes” will be given 0 point, “I  sweat much more than I used to” and “I sweat somewhat less than I used to ” will be 
given 1 point and “I sweat much less than I used to” will be scored 2 points. A detailed list of can be found in Table 3  of Appendix 6.3. 
Depending on the domain, possible scores in each domain ranged from 6 (vasomotor) to 28 
(gastrointestinal). Final score is a sum total of all subscales varying from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worsening of autonomic dysfunction. 
EQ-5D-5L 
EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQoL Group to provide 
a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ -5D- 5L consists 
of the EQ- 5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual analog scale (VAS).  
The EQ -5D- 5L descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The response to each dimension is scored as follows: 
1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, 5=unable. Lower score indicates worsening of QOL.  
The EQ VAS is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondent. The EQ VAS records a self -rating of health status on a vertical VAS anchored at 100 
(best imaginable health state) at the top and 0 (worst imaginable health state) at the bottom.  
If any of five dimensions is missing, then the index value will be set as missing.  
PGIC  
PGIC is a single- item scale. Patients choose the response that best describes t he overall change in 
their amyloidosis condition since they started taking the study medication. Patients rate their change on a 5- point scale as (1) much better, (2) a little better, (3) no change, (4) a little worse, 
(5) much worse.  
If the scale is missing, then PGIC score will be set as missing.  
PGIS 
PGIS is a single- item scale.  Patients choose the response below that best describe the severity of 
the amyloidosis condition over the past week  on a 5- point scale: (0) non e, (1) mild, (2) moderate, 
(3) seve re, or (4) very severe.  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

 4.10.1.1 Multi -center Study  
This study will be conducted at multiple centers worldwide. For analyses that include investigative 
site, the analysis will use pooled sites.  All  sites with fewer than two randomized patients per 
treatment group with non- missing baseline and Week  66 mNIS+7 composite scores will be pooled 
together within the same country and considered as a single site for analysis. If this results in any 
site with fewer than two randomized patients per pooled site, the smallest site will be pooled with the next smallest site within the same geographic region (North America, Europe, or South America/Australasia /Asia ).  If there are no other sites in the region, no further pooling will be 
conducted. 
4.10.1.2 Adjustments for Covariates  
The primary efficacy analysis will be adjusted for the following covariates measured at Baseline:  
- Disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2)  
- V30M mutation (Yes/No) 
- Previous treatment (Yes/No) 
- Baseline value of endpoint 
4.10.1.3 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
Composite score:  NIS score, modified +7 score, or mNIS+7 score  
Missing data imputation strategies for missing visit level data  
If a patient misses a visit (or the visit is performed outside th e analysis visit window), or the entire 
mNIS+7 assessment is not conducted at a visit, then the mNIS+7 and the composite, components 
and subcomponents will be considered as missing at that visit. In a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM), missing data are not explicitly imputed. Instead, all available post -Baseline 
assessments (within the scheduled visit windows) of the endpoint during the treatment period are utilized and via modelling of the within subject correlation structure, the endpoint treatment differences (which are adjusted to take account of missing data) are derived. In addition, several ‘Missing not at random’ methods are described in Section  4.10.3.2 and will be used as sensitivity 
analyses to impute missing visit level data.  
Missing data imputation strategies for missing assessment level data  
Two independent assessments of the primary efficacy endpoint, mNIS+7, are planned at the baseline visit and the Week 66 visit, and at the early termination visit (for patients that terminate 
treatment early). A single mNIS+7 assessment is also planned at the Week 35 and Week 85 visit. The mean of the two replicate assessments within visit will be used for analysis of both the baseline and Week 66 visits (provided both visits fall in the visit window and are within 52 days of the last dose of medication). Subcomponent scores will be averaged first. Note, for NIS, an additional step is needed by summing l eft side and right  side averaged score to obtain average subcomponent 
scores.   These will be referred to as the averaged subcomponent scores.   682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

visits during the treatment period, any missing question values will be imputed using the last 
observed or imputed question value (including baseline value). For the symptom domain, in the case that a patient responded on a particular question (Questions 1- 7) as not a having the 
symptom but also marked presence of the symptom in their feet, legs, hands, or arm, the question will be set to missing and the imputa tion rules will be followed.  
• Otherwise, the total for that domain will be set to missing.  
The Norfolk QOL -DN total score will be calculated by summing the imputed domain scores.  If 
any domain score after imputation is still missing, then the Norfolk QOL -DN total score will be 
set to missing.  
The Norfolk QOL -DN individual domain and total scores will only be calculated for visits where 
the patient had a Norfolk QOL -DN assessment. The individual domain and total scores are set to 
be missing if a patient mi sses the visit or does not have a Norfolk QOL -DN assessment at that visit.   
NSC Domain and Total score 
Two independent assessments of NSC are planned at the Baseline visit and the Week 66 visit. A 
single NSC assessment is planned at the Week 35 visit. The mean of the two replicate assessments 
within a visit will be used for analysis of both the Baseline and Week 66 visits (provided both visits fall in the visit window and are within 52 days of the last dose of medication). The individual questions scores w ill be averaged first. These will be referred to as the averaged question scores.  
At Baseline and Week 66, in the event that only one NSC assessment has been performed, the single NSC assessment will be used in place of the mean value for that visit for the averaged question score. If both of the NSC assessments are missing, the averaged question score is set to 
missing. At Week 35, only one assessment is performed, therefore the single NSC assessment will 
be used as the averaged question score for that vi sit. The sub -domain and domain scores will be 
computed using the averaged question scores.  
Imputing Missing Assessment Averaged Question Scores   The following imputation rule will be applied at the domain level for the sensory (hypo / loss of 
sensation),  sensory (paresthesia, hyper sensation), autonomic (GI and urinary incontinence) and 
the autonomic (other than GI/urinary incontinence) domains 
• If at least 50% of the averaged question scores in the domain are available, the missing 
questions will be set t o be equal to the mean of the non- missing averaged question scores in 
the domain. The total domain score is then calculated from the sum of the non- missing and 
imputed averaged question scores in the domain. 
• Otherwise, the domain score will be considered to be missing 
Note for the imputation of the autonomic (other than GI/urinary incontinence) component in 
women, questions 35 and 36 are ignored and are not included in the imputation procedure 
The following imputation rule will be applied at the sub-domain level for the four -muscle weakness 
sub-domains (head and neck, chest, upper limb, lower limb): 
• If at least 50% of the averaged question scores in the sub- domain are available, the missing 
averaged question scores will be set to be equal to the mean of the non- missing questions in 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

The total value f or the muscle weakness domain score is calculated by summing the four sub -
domain scores.  If one or more of the sub- domain scores is missing, the muscle weakness domain 
score will be missing.  
The total NSC score is calculated by summing the 5 domain scores .   If one or more of the domain 
scores is missing the total NSC score will be missing.  
Pattern of Missing Data   
For mNIS+7 and Norfolk QOL -DN composite scores, the pattern of missing data will be explored.  
Multiple imputation methods (Section 4.10.3.2) will be used to impute missing data in the 
sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint.  
 
Imputation of Missing/Partial Dates   
The imputation of partial or missing dates for adverse events are detailed in Section 4.12.1, and 
prior/concomitant medications Section 4.8. The hATTR -PN /FAC diagnosis and onset date of 
hATTR -PN /FAC symptoms only collected year and month information in CRF. To facilitate the 
calculation of duration, the imputat ion rules are detailed in  Section 4.6.  
Replicated Data, Unscheduled Visits, and Early Termination Visits  
When change from Baseline is assessed, unless otherwise specified, only patients with both baseline and post -baseline measurements will be included in the analyses. If baseline or post -
baseline value is missing, then the change from baseline will be set to missing.   
For patients who withdraw, all data will be reported prior to the point of withdrawal in line with the population definitions and the specified analysis.   
For data that are scheduled to be measured in duplicate or triplicate, the mean will be presented in 
tables and figures, while all measured value s will appear in the listings.  
If more than the scheduled number of measurements is taken, the mean will include all replicate measurements.  
4.10.1.4 Data Summary Plan  
The table below details what data will be included in the summary and analysis output by endpoint type, and what output is planned for Week 35 interim analysis, Week 66 final analysis, EOT at Week 85 and what output will be updated for the EOS. Data summar ized/analyzed at 35 Week 
interim, 66 Week final analysis, and EOT will be based on data collected up to the date of the data cut. In select instances, the data for a type of endpoint that is summarized or analyzed may not be consistent with the rules in th e Table; such exceptions will be noted in this SAP. Note: assessments 
for mNIS+7, NSC, and ophthalmology done early in the treatment period that are used for baseline cannot also be used as an on- treatment assessment.  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

score between ION -682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
In the Week 66 Final Analysis, for those endpoints that were statistically significant at the Week 
35 interim analysis, their corresponding tests at the Week 66 final analysis will not be conducted. The non- significant endpoint(s) (e.g., serum TTR and/or mNIS+7) and the co -primary endpoint 
Norfolk will be tested at the final analysis. T he alpha level of the final analysis for each endpoint 
will be determined by the resampling procedure ( Westfall and Young 1993) as follows.  
Let T1 and T2 be the standardized test statistics at the interim and final analyses, respectively. In order to determine the alpha level for the final analysis, the correlation between T1 and T2 is first estimated based on the resampling approach: 
• Among the 108 ION -682884 treated patients and 52 NEURO -TTR placebo patients, randomly 
assign 108 patients to the ION-682884 treated group and 52 patients to NEURO- TTR placebo 
group. 
• Apply the re -randomized treatment assignment to the interim data and obtain the standardized 
test statistics T1.  
• Apply the re -randomized treatment assignment to the final data and obtain the standardized test 
statistics T2.  
Repeat the above procedure N times (N = 10000) and obtain N pairs of test statistics T1 and T2.  
The correlation between T1 and T2 will then be estimated as the sample correlation of the  N pairs.  
Let c1 be the cut -off point for the interim 2 -sided test corresponding to an alpha of 0.025. Once the 
estimat ed correlation ρ is available, the cut -off point c2 for the final analysis is obtained by solving 
the nonlinear equation Pr(|T1| ≥ c1 or |T2| ≥ c2) = 0.05, where (T1, T2) follow a bivariate normal 
distribution with mean vector (0, 0), standard deviations of 1 and correlation ρ.  See Appendix 6.4 
for the sample programming code for alpha used in the final analysis.   
 
Week 66 Secondary Endpoint Analysis 
If all the co -primary endpoints are significant, the following secondary endpoints, which are not 
planned to be tested in the interim analysis, will be tested in the final analysis at a 2-sided alpha level  of 0.05.  The multiplicity will be controlled by using the ranking strategy in the following 
testing sequence:  
• Secondary Endpoint: Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 66 in the NSC between 
ION-682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Secondary Endpoint: Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 35 in the NSC between 
ION-682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Secondary Endpoint: Comparison of change from Baseline in the PCS score of SF -36 at Week 
65 between ION -682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Secondary Endpoint: Week 66 Final Analysis: Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 
65 in the PND between ION-682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Secondary Endpoint: Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 65 in mBMI between ION -

4.10.2.1 Primary Endpoint Analysis at Interim Analysis  
Below are the 2 primary endpoint analyses for interim analysis:  
• Comparison of percent change from Baseline to Week 35 in the serum TTR between ION -
682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 35 in the mNIS+7 between ION -682884 and 
NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
The significance level of two -sided 0.025 will be used for both comparisons.   
As noted in the Section 4.10.1, the TTR lev el from the Placebo arm in the NEURO -TTR trial will 
be converted using the following formula to match data generated by the current assay 
y=0.0057x^2+0.5843x-0.3819.  The converted value will be then used in the primary analysis. 
The percent change in serum TTR from Baseline to Week 35 will be analyzed using the MMRM 
model adjusted by propensity score weights. The MMRM model will also include the effects of treatment (ION -682884 or NEURO -TTR placebo), time (categorical), disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 
2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), and previous treatment with Vyndaqel® or Diflunisal (Yes/No), 
treatment-by- time interaction, baseline value of the endpoint, and the baseline -by-time interaction. 
The propensity score will be calculated for each NEURO -TTR placebo or IO N-682884 patient 
using a logistic regression model with covariates including disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), and previous treatment with Vyndaqel ® or Diflunisal (Yes/No).  
Model parameters and treatment effects could be estimated by  the following example SAS code:

In this model, missing data are not explicitly imputed. Instead, all available p ost-baseline 
assessments up to the Week 35 endpoint during the treatment period (which fall in the visit 
windows) for subjects in the FAS are utilized, and via modelling of the within -subject correlation 
structure, the endpoint treatment differences (which  are adjusted to take account of missing data) 
are derived.  The estimation of treatment differences is based upon the assumption that the missing 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

An unstructured 
variance-c ovariance matrix will be used to model the within-patient errors, and 
the degrees of freedom will 
be determined using Kenward-Roger method (Kenward, M. G. and 
Roger, J. H. 
(1997)).  If there are convergence issues with the model, the six methods below will 
be conducted in the following sequence to solve the convergency issues.   
1)SCORING
=4 option could be used in the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  This will direct
SAS to use the Fisher scoring with the first 4 iterations.
2)TYPE = FA0(t) option will be used where t is the dimension of covariance matrix.

If the Shapiro -Wilks test assessing normality of the MMRM r esiduals is statistically significant at 
the 0.01 level, a stratified Wilcoxon rank sum test will be provided and the result will be considered 
as Primary Analysis for TTR.  
The mNIS+7 is scheduled to be assessed at Week 35, Week 66, and Week 85. Because o nly 1 post- Baseline assessment (Week 35) is available at Week 35 Interim Analysis, 
the treatment comparison at Week 35 will be based on the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusted by propensity score.  The Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will also 
include the effects of treatment (ION 682884 or NEURO -TTR placebo), disease stage (Stage 
1/Stage 2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), and previous treatment with Vyndaqel® or Diflunisal (Yes/No), and the baseline value of the endpoint. Patients with a missing mNIS+7 at Week 35 
will have value multiple imputed using an imputation model (Based on MAR assumption) that contains the following variables: disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), previous treatment with Vyndaqel ® or Diflunisal (Yes/No),  and the Baseline value of the 
endpoint and the multiple imputation will be stratified by treatment group (Schafer 1997; Schafer 1999).  The details are provided in Section 4.10.3.2. Of note, multiple imputation here is treated as primary analysis, which will be based on on-treatment data for Full Analysis Set. In addition, ANCOVA based on observed data (with missing value ) will be treated as sensitivity analysis 
(please see Sensitivity Analysis 8 ).   
Similarly to MMRM above, if the Shapiro -Wilks test assessing normality of the ANCOVA 
residuals is statistically significant at the 0.01 level, a stratified Wilcoxon rank sum test will be provided.  
4.10.2.2 Secondary Endpoint Analysis at Interim Analysis 
If both co -primary endpoints of interim analysis (TTR and mNIS+7) are significant at alpha level 
of two -sided 0.025, then the secondary endpoint (Norfolk) below will be tested at the interim 
analysis at alpha level of 0.025.   
• Secondary Endpoint: Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 35 in the Norfolk total 
score between ION -682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the Full Analysis Set 
Similarly to mNIS+7, because only 1 post -Baseline Norfolk assessment (Week 35) is available at 
Week 35 interim analysis, the same analysis of mNIS+7 will be applied for Norfolk.   
 
4.10.2.3 Primary Analysis at Week 66 Final Analysis  
Below are the 3 primary treatment comparisons planned in the Week 66 final analysis:  
• Co-Primary Endpoint: Comparison of percent change from Baseline to Week 65 in the s erum 
TTR between ION-682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Co-Primary Endpoint: Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 66 in the mNIS+7 
between ION -682884 and NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS

analysis, their corresponding tests at the Week 66 final analysis will not be conducted. The non-significant endpoint(s) (serum TTR and/or mNIS+7) and the co -primary endpoint Norfolk will be 
tested at the final analysis. T he alpha level of the final analysis for each endpoint will be determined 
by the resampling procedure (see Sectio n 4.10.1.5
).  
For percent ch
ange from Baseline of TTR at Week 65, change from Baseline of mNIS+7 at Week 
66, and change from Baseline of Norfolk QOL -DN at Week 66, a MMRM model adjusted by 
propensity score weights will be used. Similar to the interim analysis for TTR, the MMRM model will include the effects of treatment (ION -682884 or NEURO -TTR placebo), time (categorical), 
disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), and previous treatment with Vyndaqel® or Diflunisal (Yes/No), treatment-by- time interaction,  baseline value of the endpoint, and the 
baseline-by- time interaction. The propensity score will be calculated using the same logistic 
regression model in the primary analysis (Section 4.10.2.1). In this model, missing data are not 
explicitly imputed. Instead, all available post -baseline assessments up to the Week 65 (or Week 
66) endpoints during the treatment period (which fall in the visit windows) fo r subjects in the FAS 
are utilized and via modeling of the within subject correlation structure, the endpoint treatment differences (which are adjusted to take account of missing data) are derived.  
 
4.10.3 Additional Analyses of Primary Endpoints  
4.10.3.1 Sensitivity Analyses  
In addition to the primary efficacy analysis performed in either interim analysis or final analysis, 
the following sensitivity analyses will be conducted on the FAS and for each endpoint (TTR, mNIS+7, Norfolk) performed in the Week 35 interim analysis  and Week 66 final analyses, except 
where noted: 
• Sensitivity Analysis 1  (Non -Parametric Analysis).  The non -parametric stratified Wilcoxon 
rank sum test will also be performed for the primary study endpoints adjusted by stratified 
propensity score weights as the sensitivity analysis.  The stratum will consist of 4 quartiles levels of the propensity scores (<=Q1, >Q1 and <= Median, > Median and <=Q3, > Q3). Hodges- Lehmann estimates of the differences between ION -682884 group and NEURO -TTR 
placebo group based on the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test will also be provided. The propensity 
score will be calculated using the same logistic regression model in the primary analysis (Section 4.10.2.1). This sensitivity analysis will be applied for each analysis (TTR, mNIS+7, 
Norfolk) performed in the Week 35 interim analysis and Week 66 final analyses.  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the impact of alternative missing data assumptions (Multiple imputation, see Section 4.10.3.2). All assessments that are within the 
analysis windows are included, even if conducted more than 52 days after last dose. These 
sensitivity analys es will be applied for serum TTR in the Week 35 interim analysis and serum TTR, 
mNIS+7, and Norfolk in Week 66 final analyses . These analyses will be done on the Safety Set 
and will be labeled as:

• Sensitivity Analysis 5  (PPS) – The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated, using the PPS 
population. This se nsitivity analysis will be applied for each analysis (serum TTR, mNIS+7, 
Norfolk) performed in the Week 35 interim analysis and Week 66 final analyses. 
• Sensitivity Analysis 6  (Responder Analysis) – A responder analysis based on the change in 
mNIS +7 score will be conducted to examine whether improvement in response is consistent 
over a range of response thresholds. A responder is defined as a patient whose mNIS +7 score change from baseline to Week 66 is less than or equal to the threshold value. Thresholds  that 
will be tested will include -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 points above the baseline value.  For each of these 
specific response thresholds, the response rates at Week 66 for both the ION -682884 treated 
group and the NEURO -TTR placebo group will be calculated  and plotted against the response 
threshold.  Patients that terminate treatment early irrespective of the reason or that had missing Week 66 data will be considered a non -responder.  
This sensitivity analysis will also be applied for mNIS+7 performed in th e Week 35 interim 
analysis using change from baseline to Week 35. 
Same responder analysis will also be presented for Norfolk for both Week 35 interim analysis 
and Week 66 final analysis.  
  
• Sensitivity Analysis 7  (Propensity Analysis using 6 covariates). Ad ditional 
ANCOVA/MMRM model will also be performed for the primary endpoints adjusted by propensity score weights as the sensitivity analysis.  In addition to 3 factors (Disease Stage, V30M, and Previous treatment) used in the logistic model for propensity score in the primary analysis, this sensitivity analysis will include additional 3 covariates (6 covariates total) below: 
o Gender (Male, Female)  
o Modified BMI baseline (continuous value)  
o Region (Europe, North America, South America/Australia /Asia) 
  
• Sensitivity Analysis 8  (Observed data - ANCOVA) - The same ANCOVA in the primary 
analysis will be performed based on observed data for mNIS+7 and NORFOLK for Week 35 Interim analysis.   
4.10.3.2 Multiple Imputation Methodology  
First, a repeated measures Gaussian model will be fitted to the data using a Bayesian approach, with non- informative priors for the mean and variance -covariance matrix to provide a joint 
posterior for the parameters in this model.  The repeated measures Gaussian model will include 
separate mean profiles for each treatment group and the same covariates as those in the primary MMRM analysis for final analysis and TTR at interim analysis based on on -study data for Safety

analysis will be used in multiple imputation based on on- treatment data for Full Analysis Set.   
Independent samples will then be drawn from the posterior distributions for the mean and variance -
covariance matrix to provide inputs into an imputation model.  For each subject with missing data, 
these sampled values of the parameters for mean vectors and the variance- covariance matrices 
specify a joint distribution for their observe d and unobserved outcome data. 
The post -withdrawal part of each pattern -specific distribution will be modelled using three 
different approaches discussed below.  This imputation model will have the same covariates as 
those in the primary MMRM analysis.  
Based on this imputation model, a single set of data will be sampled for the missing data based on 
the distribution for the subject’s missing data conditional upon their observed data. 
The post -withdrawal part of each pattern -specific distribution will be mod elled using these three 
approaches: 1. MAR approach.  
The means and variance -covariances following withdrawal are chosen to reflect the subject’s own 
treatment group. This approach should provide similar numerical results to the primary analysis. 
For Final an alysis and TTR at Week 35 interim analysis, all assessments that are within the analysis 
windows are included in this analysis, even if conducted more than 52 days after last dose (On -
Study). For mNIS+7 and NORFOLK at Week 35 interim analysis, only data wi thin 52 days after 
last dose (On -Treatment) will be included.  
2. CIR approach.  
The CIR approach is detailed in Carpenter et al. (2013)  and addresses a potential pattern of 
informative missingness where the assumption is that the active Study Drug halts or slow disease 
progression, and the disease progresses after treatment is discontinued. In CIR, missing data in the NEURO- TTR placebo group will be imputed under a within -treatment arm MAR assumption. For 
patients in the 682884- CS3 treatment group (ION -682884), their mean profile (i.e., mean 
increments) will track that of the NEURO -TTR placebo group, but starting from the benefit 
obtained from the previous visit. All assessments that are within the analysis windows are inc luded 
in this analysis, even if conducted more than 52 days after last dose.   
3. J2R approach. 
The J2R approach is detailed in Carpenter et al. (2013)  and is an extremely conservative imputation 
approach that assumes that a patient receiving active Study Drug does not sustain benefit after 
discontinuation of study drug. In J2R, missing data in the NEURO -TTR placebo group will be 
imputed under a within -treatment arm MAR assumption. For patients with missing data in the  
ION-682884 treatment group, their mean response distribution is set to equal that of the NEURO-TTR placebo group. All assessments that are within the analysis windows are included in this analysis, even if conducted more than 52 days after last dose. 
For each imputation method used, at least 500 imputed datasets will be generated. The imputed 
observations in each dataset will be checked to ensure they are within the possible change from 
baseline range for the particular subject they belong to. If a dataset  contains out -of-range values, it 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

out-of- range values. Each of 500 imputed data sets will then be analyzed using a simple ANCOVA 
model at Week 35 and Week 6 6, and the resulting treatment differences and their standard errors 
will be combined using Rubin’s rules. The ANCOVA model adjusted by propensity score will 
include the effects of treatment (ION 682884 or NEURO -TTR placebo), disease stage (Stage 
1/Stage 2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), and previous treatment with Vyndaqel® or Diflunisal 
(Yes/No), and the baseline value of the endpoint.  Note that in these analyses, efficacy assessments that are within the analysis window but more than 52 days after last dose will be included. This is different from the primary analysis, where data after 52 days from last dose is excluded. The number of imputed datasets may be increased after review of results if the simulation error is considered large.  
A random seed to be used by a random number generator with value of 2855 will be used to initiate 
data imputation for all three methods.  
4.10.4 Subgroup Analyses of Primary Endpoints  
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for each of the two primary efficacy endpoints in the FAS.  
Subgroups defined by the following variables will be evaluated: 
• V30M mutation (Yes, No) 
• Age (< 65 years, 65- 74 years, ≥ 75 years old)  
• Race (White, non- White)  
• Sex (Male, Female)  
• Region (North America, Europe, South America/Austral ia/Asia)  
• Previous treatmen t with Vyndaqel ® or Diflunisal (Yes, No) 
• Disease stage (Stage 1, Stage 2)  
• FAC Clinical Diagnosis from CRF  (Yes , No)  
• CM subgroup (Yes, No): CM subgroup (Yes) includes patients with 1) a diagnosis of TTR 
cardiomyopathy at study entry or 2) baseline intervent ricular septum thickness >= 13 mm on 
echocardiogram AND no hypertension or ventricular hypertrophy in past medical history or 
diagnosed on study AND no two consecutive systolic blood pressure readings of >=150 mmHg 
at any time during the study (including screening and baseline visits).     
For TTR (at Week 35 and Week 65), mNIS+7 (at Week 66) and Norfolk (at Week 66), the MMRM adjusted by propensity score for the change from baseline with include fixed categoric al effects for 
treatment, time, disease stage, V30M mutation, and previous treatment, treatment -by-time 
interaction , treatment-by- subgroup interaction, and treatment-by- time-by-subgroup interaction.  
The baseline value of the endpoint and the baseline -by-t ime interaction will be included as 
covariates in the model. The treatment-by- subgroup interaction at each timepoint will be tested at 
the significance level of 0.10. Treatment group differences will be evaluated within each category of the subgroup, regar dless of whether the interaction is statistically significant.  The propensity 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

4.10.5 Secondary Efficacy Variables for Week 66 Final Analysis 
The secondary endpoints at Week 66 Final Analysis include the following analyses: 
• Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 66 in the NSC between ION -682884 and 
NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 35 in the NSC between ION -682884 and 
NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Comparison of change from Baseline in the PCS score of SF -36 at Week 65 between ION -
682884 or NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
• Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 65 in the PND between ION -682884 and 
NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS  
•  Comparison of change from Baseline to Week 65 in mBMI between ION- 682884 and 
NEURO-TTR placebo in the FAS 
Treatment group differences will be evaluated using the same method as the primary efficacy 
analysis (MMRM described in Section 4.10.2). These analyses will be conducted on both the FAS 
and the PPS populations. No sensitivity analyses will be conducted.   
The normality assumptions for the MMRM will be assessed for each of the seco ndary endpoints 
by inspecting the following plots: 
• Histogram of marginal studentized residuals derived from the MMRM model.  
• Normal probability plot.  
The non- parametric stratified Wilco xon rank sum test may be performed as a sensitivity analysis, 
if deemed necessary.  Hodges- Lehmann estimates of the differences between ION -682884 and 
NEURO- TTR placebo as well as distribution -free confidence intervals based on the Wilcoxon 
Rank Sum Test will also be provided.  
 4.10.6 Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
Analyses of PD endpoints will be evaluated using the same method as the primary efficacy analysis 
(MMRM described in Section  4.10.2).  No sensitivity analyses will be conducted  except for TTR.  
All PD analyses will be conducted on both the FAS and the PPS. 
Additionally, the proportion of subjects with percentage decrease from baseline in s erum  TTR 
<50%, ≥50%, ≥60%, ≥70%, ≥80%, and ≥90%  will be summarized by treatment group at each visit.  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

placebo are listed below:  
• SF-36 components 
• All cause hospitalizations  
• Transthoracic ECHO parameters of interest  
• NT-proBNP  
For SF-36, descriptiv e statistics will be provided for absolute values and change from baseline at 
Week 35 for each component.  For NT -proBNP and High- Sensitivity Troponin T, descriptive statistics for original scale and log -
transformed will be provided for absolute values and change from baseline at Week 35 and 65. 
The change from baseline will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with fixed effects of 
treatment, disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2), V30M mutation (Yes/No), and previous treatment with 
Vyndaqel® or Diflunisal (Yes/No),  and baseline value as covariate based on FAS adjusted by 
propensity score.  The propensity score will be calculated using the same logistic regression model in the primary analysis (See Section 4.10.2.1).  
For all cause hospitalizations and all cause hospitalizations in patients with cardiac involvement, 
summary tables will be provided and Chi- square test will be used for analysis.  
Protocol- specified ECHO parameters will be analyzed for patients with baseline wall thickness 
>15mm using an MMRM model with fixed effects of treatment, disease stage (Stage 1/Stage 2), 
V30M mutation (Yes/No), and previous treatment with Vyndaqel ® or Diflunisal (Yes/No),  and 
baseline value as covariate.  
 
In addition, TTR will be summarized for Inotersen reference arm in 682884 -CS3.

4.11.1 PK Analysis  
4.11.1.1 Plasma Concentration Data  
Plasma concentrations of ION -682884 (as total full -length oligonucleotides, including fully, 
partially, and un- conjugated ION -682884) or inotersen, along with the scheduled (nominal) and 
actual sampling times (i.e., time from SC dosing) will be listed for each evaluable patient by 
treatment, actual dose, gender, subject IM status, and study day.  Plasma concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be indicated by “BLQ”.  Percent differences between nominal and actual dose, as well as between scheduled and actual sampling times, will also be listed for all patients.   
For all patients who receive ION -682884 and/or inotersen treatment, ION -682884 or inotersen 
plasma trough and post -treatment concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
by treatment, dose, study day, and scheduled time point, without and with stratification by subject IM status (see Section 4.11.3).  ION -682884 or inotersen plasma concentrations from the PK 
subgroup will a lso be similarly summarized.  For the purpose of calculating typical summary 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, SE, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) for plasma concentrations, all BLQ values will be set to zero. Mean plasma concentrations that are below the LLOQ will be presented as BLQ, and the SD, SE, %CV, and 
geometric %CV will be reported as not applicable.  Other stratifications may also be performed if 
deemed warranted to properly interpret the pharmacokinetic analys is. Samples will be excluded 
from descriptive statistics if there are large deviations between scheduled and actual sampling times (percent difference between scheduled and actual sampling time greater than 30%), or large deviations between actual dose and  nominal dose (percent difference between nominal and actual 
dose greater than 30%).  Any samples excluded from the summary descriptive statistics, if deemed necessary, will be listed separately along with the reason for exclusion. 
For all evaluable patien ts, ION-682884 or inotersen  plasma trough (pre -dose) and post -treatment 
concentrations versus time (actual) profiles from Study Day 1 up to 729 for each individual patient, 
as well as corresponding mean ( +SD) plasma concentration versus time (scheduled) profiles will 
be presented graphically on linear and semilogarithmic scales, without and with stratification by 
subject immunogenicity status (se e Section 4.11.3).  For the PK subgroup only, ION-682884 or 
inotersen  plasma concentration versus time (actual) profiles from Study Day 1, from Study Day 
225, and from Study Day 449, for each patient, as well as correspondi ng mean ( +SD) plasma 
concentration versus time (scheduled) profiles (by treatment), will be presented graphically on linear and semilogarithmic scales, without and with stratification by subject immunogenicity status (see Section 4.11.3). Other stratifications may also be  performed if deemed warranted.  At the 
discretion of the pharmacokineticist and/or biostatistician, samples may be excluded from the mean plots if there are large deviations between scheduled and actual sa mpling times, or large deviations 
between actual dose and nominal dose. 
4.11.2 Plasma PK Parameters  
Non-compartmental PK analysis of ION -682884 or inotersen will be carried out on each evaluable 
individual patient data for the PK subgroup following ION -682884 or inotersen treatment, 
respectively, using Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3 or higher (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

will be set to zero.   
For the PK subgroup only, the following plasma PK parameters will be calculated (when applicable and possible) based on actual sampling times: 
• Cmax (µg/mL):  the maximum observed drug concentration in plasma.  Calculated for dosing 
on Study Days 1, 225, and 449. 
• tmax (h): the time at which Cmax occurs.  Calculated for dosing on Study Days 1, 225, and 
449. 
• AUC0 -6h (µg•hr/mL):  areas under the plasma concentration -time curve from zero time (pre -
dose) to 6 hours after the SC administration will be calculated using the linear- up log-down 
trapezoidal rule following dosing on Study Days 1, 225, and 449.  
For all evaluable patients (including subjects participating in the PK subgroup) who have sufficient post- treatment samples collected, the apparent plasma terminal elimination half- life will be 
calculated as described below:  
• t
½λz (day):  the plasma disposition half- life associated with the apparent terminal elimination 
phase may be calculated from the equation, t 1/2λz = 0.693/λ z, based on any evaluable post -
treatment data with scheduled collections between Days 589 and 729.  A minimum of three 
data points in the elimination phase will be used to define λ z, and the correlation of 
determination values (r2_adjusted) have to be at or greater than 0.8 and a span of at least 1.5 
for the esti mate to be accepted.  Note: if quantifiable data is only available from just 2 time 
points, span< 1.5, or r2_adjusted < 0.8, this parameter may still be determined at the discretion 
of the pharmacokineticist and will be flagged as such. Note: calculation o f this parameter may 
not be possible in patients rolling into an open-label extension study. 
Plasma PK parameters will be listed by treatment, dose, subject ID, subject IM status, and study day; and appropriately summarized (overall and separately for the PK subgroup) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, SE, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and 
maximum) by treatment and study day. Additionally, subject IM status stratified (see 
Section  4.11.3) plas ma PK parameters will be similarly summarized). Other stratifications may 
also be performed if deemed warranted at the discretion of the pharmacokineticist and/or biostatistician.  
Exposure- response relationships between selected pharmacodynamic (including but not limited to 
TTR level, mNIS+7 and Norfolk QOL -DN score) and/or safety measures ((including but not 
limited to ALT) and PK measures (including but not limited to plasma trough concentrations) at selected time points (e.g., Day 29, Day 85, Day 225, etc.) may also be explored (may include with and without stratification by IM status), where appropriate.  
 
4.11.3 IM Analysis 
Samples collected at pre -dose on Study Days 1 (baseline), 29, 85, 225, 337, 449, 589 and 729, 
including early termination samples for IM as sessment will be analyzed for anti -ION-682884 
antibodies or anti -inotersen antibodies (ADA) for patients receiving ION -682884 or inotersen, 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

for both anti- ION-682884 and anti- inotersen  antibodies. 
 
4.11.3.1 Sample Level ADA Data 
An evaluable sample will be designated ‘IM positive’ based on both positive screening and 
confirmation assay results (i.e., confirmed positive result), and otherwise will be deemed ‘IM negative’. An unevaluable sample, for example, a sample not being store d properly, or insufficient 
volume for analysis,  will be reported as “unknown”.  Sample IM results (screen positive/negative, 
confirmed positive/negative or unknown, and when applicable, titer of anti -ION- 682884 or anti-
inotersen  antibodies) before, during, and after treatment with study drug (sample IM status) will 
be listed by treatment, dose , and day of collection.   
The sample ADA incidence (number) and incidence rate (percent) at each evaluated study time point will be determined and appropriately sum marized by treatment and dose as the total number 
of and percentage of evaluated subjects with sample ADA negative, positive, and unknown status.  Furthermore, titer over time will be also appropriately summarized (using descriptive statistics) as median, quartiles (25% and 75%), and range by treatment and dose. 
4.11.3.2 Subject Level ADA Data 
Subject ADA status overall (ADASTAT) will be defined as ‘Positive’ status if they have at least 
one confirmed positive sample result at any time during the treatment or post -treatment evaluation 
periods; ‘Negative’ status if all evaluated ADA sample results during the treatment and post -
treatment evaluation periods are ADA negative and they have at least one evaluable ADA result collected post study drug treatment.  Otherwise, a study subject will be assigned ‘Unknown’ ADA status.   
Furthermore, subjects wi th positive overall ADA status will be further classified into different 
ADA types (ADATYPE) based on their baseline ADA status and change in ADA titer post treatment as described below (Shankar et al., 2014 ): 
• Treatment -Emergent ADA: sum of treatment-induc ed ADA and treatment -boosted ADA 
as described below:  
o Treatment -Induced ADA: ADA developed de novo (seroconversion) following 
biologic drug administration (i.e., formation of ADA any time after the initial drug 
administration in a subject without pre- existing ADA, i.e., baseline negative 
ADA)  
o Treatment -Boosted ADA: pre -existing ADA that were boosted to a higher level 
following biologic drug administration (i.e., any time after the initial drug administration the ADA titer is greater than the baseline titer by a factor of 8 -fold 
or more  
• Treatment -Unaffected ADA: pre -existing ADA that were not affected (boosted) following 
biologic drug administration (i.e., any time after the initial drug administration the ADA 
titer is 4 -fold or less)  682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

Other subject level IM parameters to be calculated/defined may include but not limited to:  
• Subject ADA Status at Baseline (ADASTATB): "Positive" if the subject has Week 1 Day 
1 pre- dose sample (ba seline) tested as confirmed positive; "Negative" if the subject has 
Week 1 Day 1 pre-dose sample (baseline) tested as confirmed negative; "Unknown" if the subject has Week 1 Day 1 pre- dose sample (baseline) unevaluable.  
• Onset of ADA (TFSTADA): i.e., the first day ADA positive sample observed, will be 
calculated by: the date of first sample has “positive” sample IM status - first dose date +1.  
This parameter will be calculated for subjects with positive ADA status overall and subjects 
with treatment-induced ADA, respectively. 
• Last Positive ADA Study Day (TLSTADA): defined as the last positive ADA sample 
observed from the start of study drug treatment and will be calculated by: the date of last sample has “positive” sample IM status - first dose date +1  
• Last IM Sampling Study Day (TLSTSAMP): defined as the last ADA sample collected from the start of study drug treatment and will be calculated by: the date of last sample collected - first dose date +1  
• Peak titer (PEAKTIT): the highest titer observed for the sub ject  
• Time to peak titer (TPEAKTIT): the time to reach peak titer will be calculated by:  
the date of first peak titer observed - first dose date +1  
• Total number of ADA Positive Samples (NOPOSAMP):  the total number of ADA samples being confirmed positive for the subject  
• Total number of ADA Samples evaluated (NOADASAMT): the total number of ADA samples being collected and analyzed successfully with reportable results for the subject  
Lastly, subjects with positive ADA status may further be classified as being transient or persistent 
ADA response, if there are sufficient number of subjects with transient ADA status. Transient and persistent ADA definitio ns are defined below and based on Shankar et al., 2014: 
Transient ADA response:  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at one sampling time point during the treatment or 
follow -up observation period (excluding the last sampling time point, which will be 
considered persistent unless shown to be undetectable at a later time) or  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the 
treatment (including follow -up period if any), where the ﬁrst and last ADA -positive 
samples (irrespective of  any negative samples in between) are separated by a period less 
than 16 weeks, and the subject’s last sampling time point is ADA-negative. 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

samples (irrespective of any negative samples in between) are separated by a period of 16 
weeks or longer or 
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at the last sampling time point of the s tudy 
treatment period or at a sampling time point with less than 16 weeks before an ADA-negative last sample.  
The subject level ADA prevalence, incidence, and positive ADA response being transient or 
persistent (if applicable) will be calculated as the number and the proportion (percent) of the study population during the study period by treatment and dose.  Subject level IM parameters (as described above) will be listed by treatment and dose for all evaluable subjects, and also appropriately summarized (us ing descriptive statistics) as median, quartiles (25% and 75%) and 
range, by treatment and dose.  Additionally, Subject level IM parameters will be also summarized for subjects with Treatment-Induced ADA only (i.e., excluding subjects with pre- existing ADA ). 
 
4.11.3.3 Evaluation of IM Impact on PK, PD, Efficacy and Safety 
The impact of IM on PK, PD, and safety will be evaluated by stratifying plasma PK parameters, 
plasma trough and post -treatment ION -682884 and inotersen concentrations, PD biomarker levels, 
selected  clinical efficacy endpoints and safety measures by subject ADA status and titer quartiles, 
summarized using typical descriptive statistics, and presented graphically and/or in tables.  Efficacy measures to be stratified by subject ADA status will include but may not be limited to TTR level, mNIS+7 and Norfolk QOL -DN scores.  Safety measures to be stratified by subject 
ADA status will include but may not be limited to AEs, and lab tests for hematology, liver and kidney functions.   
Additionally, within subject comparisons on plasma C
max and AUC may be conducted in patients 
from the PK subgroup and presented graphically by subject ADA status and treatment if deemed 
appropriate ( Wang YM, et al, 2016 ).   
Lastly, other stratifications (e.g., based on antibody titer, onset of ADA, subjects with treatment-emergent ADA vs. t reatment -unaffected ADA etc.) of selected PK, efficacy and safety assessments 
may also be performed if deemed warranted at the discretion of the pharmacokineticist, medical monitor, and/or biostatistician.

Additional treatment group (e.g., Inotersen/ION -682884 Total) will be included if applicable. The 
following imputation rules will be applied to impute AE s tart dates under conservative principles. 
If the month, year, and day are missing, the adverse event start date will be imputed as the treatment 
start date. If month and day are missing and year is available and is the same year as in treatment start date,  the month and day from the treatment start date will be used to impute the missing month 
and day for the adverse event start date. Otherwise, missing month and day will be imputed as January 01. If day is missing and month and year is available and the month and year are the same month and year in treatment start date, the day from the treatment start date will be used to impute missing day for the adverse event start date. Otherwise, missing day will be imputed as 01.  
4.12.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA Version 25.0 or later version. 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as adverse events that occurred or 
worsened after the first dose.  An AE with a completely missing start date will be assumed to be 
treatment emergen t. Note, Scenario 1 below indicate s the ‘worsened’ case.  
In addition, if severity of an AE changes during the study, a separate AE will be recorded for each 
severity on the AE CRF  with link . The “first” and “second” AE will be identified based on the AE 
start date and AE end date. The AE start date of the second record is the AE end date of the first 
record. These linked events should be compared pairwise based on severity (mild/moderate/severe).  Consider three scenarios:  
• Scenario  1: The first AE record occurs prior to the first dose, the second AE record occurs 
on or after the first dose, and the severity increases: Only the second record will be counted as treatment -emergent.  
• Scenario 2: The first AE record occurs prior to the first dose, the second AE record occurs on or after the first dose, and the severity decreases: Neither record will be counted as treatment- emergent.  
• Scenario 3: Both records occur on or after the first dose: only the most severe AE will be 
counted as TEAE. 
For 682884- CS3 Inotersen/I ON-682884 group, TEAEs which first occurred or worsened on or 
after first dosing date of ION-682884 will be defined as the TEAEs after switch to ION -682884; 
otherwise, they will be defined as TEAEs before switch to ION -682884. 
  
The following imputation rules will be applied to impute AE start dates under conservative 
principles. If the month, year, and day are missing, the adverse event start date will be imputed as the treatment start date. If month and day are missing and year is available and is the same year as in treatment start date, the month and day from the treatment start date will be used to impute the missing month and day for the adverse event start date. Otherwise, missing month and day will be imputed as January 01. If day is missing and month and year is available and the month and year are the same month and year in treatment start date, the day from the treatment start date will be 682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

4.12.1.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
AESI, inc luding both serious or non- serious events, is one of scientific and medical concern 
specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor could be appropriate. AESI, if defined in the 
study protocol, are required to be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor immediately, no more than 24 hours of the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event. They are not necessarily those expected to be related to study drug or those most frequently occurring.  
AESI defined in this SAP are shown in the table below.  Additionally, thrombocytopenia AESI of 
platelet count < 50 x 10^9/L accompanied by a clinically relevant, bleeding events (MB) or clinically relevant, non -major bleeding events (CRNMB), or platelet count of < 25 x 10^9/L 
independent of a MB or CRNMB event was defined in the protocol as reportable AESI and should be subject to 15-day expedited reporting by the Sponsor to the regulatory agencies.

labs. The central lab listing will be based on the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) dataset and will include all central lab records. The local lab listing will be based on the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) dataset. A separate listing for platelets that includes asse ssment from both the local 
and central labs will be provided.  A separate listing will contain only values outside of normal ranges.  
 
Unless otherwise specified, if the lab value with symbols (e.g., <, >, >=, <=, and ?), the symbol

Except for ALT, AST, ALP, Bilirubin, Platelet and eGFR (see Section 4.12.2.1- 4.12.2.3), 
Selected laboratory parameters were classified by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) grade ( Appendix 6.5). Shift tables from ION -682884 Baseline to worst 
post-treatment value will be provided. In addition, shift table for confirmed nadir hemoglobin will be presented .   
Additional investigation of hepatobiliary laboratory assessments, platelet counts, and renal parameters will be performed, and are detailed in the sections below. In this investigation, confirmed laboratory values will also be summarized.   
A confirmed laboratory value is based on consecutive lab values within 7 days. If that value is in 
the same or worse category the initial value is confirmed. If the consecutive value is in a better category then the initial value is confirmed in the better value category.  If there is no retest within 7 days, then the initial value is presumed confirmed. If there are multiple results on the same day 
(no matter from the same lab vendor or different lab vendors), then the worst value will be utilized in the analysis.  
Selected central laboratory test results will be graphed by value ( include scheduled and 
unscheduled visit) for individual patients (spaghetti plots over time).  Results from both central 
and local laboratory for platelets will be included in the spaghetti plot.  In addition, mean (±SE) by 
visit plot will be presented.

DSMB will be assembled and meet periodically to review safety and tolerability data collected on 
ION‑682884 and inotersen, and to review the results of the predetermined interim analysis at Week 
35. Based on its assessment of the safety and of ION‑682884 and inotersen, the DSMB will provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, stopping or continuing the study as planned. 
Details on the safety assessments, frequency of review, meeting schedules and controlled access 
to data are outlined in the DSMB Charter.  
 
4.13 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size for this study was estimated based on the data from the NEURO -TTR clinical 
trial. 
With 140 patients (120 of them dosed with ION -682884) and assuming a 10% dropout rate, there 
would be 108 evaluable pat ients treated with ION -682884. In the NEURO -TTR trial, there are 52 
evaluable placebo patients.  
It is observed that the NEURO -TTR placebo group had a 23.8 point increase in the mNIS+7 score 
from Baseline to Week 66. It is estimated that the ION -682884 group will have a 4.2 point increase 
in mNIS+7. The SD of the change from Baseline is estimated to be 20. There would be at least 
90% power to detect a 19.6 point difference in the change from Baseline of the mNIS+7 score between ION -682884- treated patients an d the NEURO- TTR -placebo patients, with a 2- sided alpha 
level of 0.025. 
For the Norfolk QOL -DN, it is observed that the NEURO -TTR placebo group had 10.7 points 
change from Baseline to Week 66. It is estimated that the ION -682884- treated group will have a 0 
point change from Baseline. The SD is estimated to be 20. There would be at least 80% power to 
detect a 10.7 points difference in the change from Baseline of the Norfolk QOL -DN between ION-
682884- treated patients and the NEURO -TTR placebo patients, with a 2- sided alpha level of 0.025. 
For the TTR percent change from Baseline, it is observed that the NEURO -TTR placebo group 
had 9.7% reduction from Baseline to Week 65. It is estimated that the ION -682884- treated group 
will have at least 80% reduction from Bas eline. The SD is estimated to be 13%. There would be at 
least 95% power to detect a 70.3% difference in the percent change from Baseline between ION -
682884- treated patients and the NEURO -TTR -placebo patients, with a 2 -sided alpha level of 
0.025. 
 4.14 Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analysis

Neuropathy Symptoms and Change (NSC)  
The NSC questionnaire consists of 38 questions asking about different symptoms. 
A symptom is marked as present if in the judgment of the examining neurologist, it occurs more 
frequently or more severely than in healthy persons of the same age and gender and is due to 
neuropathy.  If a symptom is present its severity is graded as 1 (slight +), 2 (moderate ++) or 3 (severe +++).  If the symptom is not present it is given a score of 0.  
Two questions (35 and 36) are only answered by men.  These are not included in t he score for 
women. 
The questions in the NSC can be divided into the following domains 
• Muscle weakness:            Questions 1 -19 
• Sensory (hypo / loss of sensation):            Questions 20-22 
• Sensory (paresthesia, hyper sensation):          Questions 23 - 29  
• Autonomic (GI/urinary incontinence):          Questions 31, 32, 33, 34 
• Autonomic (other than GI/urinary incontinence): Questions 30, 35- 38 for men  
                                                                    Questions 30, 37-38 for women 
The Mu scle weakness domain is also divided into 4 sub -domains: 
• Head and Neck:               Questions 1-6 
• Chest:     Questions 7-9 
• Upper Limbs:    Questions 10-15 
• Lower Limbs:    Questions 16-19 
For each sub -domain and domain the total score is obtained by summing t he relevant questions.  
The maximum score is therefore 57 for muscle weakness, 9 for Sensory (hypo / loss of sensation), 
21 for Sensory (paresthesia, hyper sensation), 12 for Autonomic (GI/urinary incontinence), 15 for Autonomic (other than GI/urinary inco ntinence) in men and 9 for Autonomic (other than 
GI/urinary incontinence) in women.  The minimum score is zero for each domain. 
The NSC total score is the sum of the scores across all 5 domains.  The minimum NSC total score 
is therefore 0 and the maximum N SC total score is 114 for men and 108 for women. 
For questions 20- 29 the location affected is also collected on the questionnaire but this information 
is not used in the calculation of the domain or total scores.     682884-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan    03 Jun 2022 | 1.0

Below is the sample SAS code for the calculation of the alpha used in the final analysis.   
 
Step 1: obtain the correlation coefficient between interim analysis and final analysis. 
Let T1 and T2 be the standardized test statistics at the interim and final analyses, respectively. In 
order to determine the alpha level for the final analysis, the correlation between T1 and T2 is  
first estimated based on the resampling approach:  
 
• Among the 108 ION-682884- treated patients and 52 NEURO -TTR placebo patients, 
randomly assign 108 patients to the ION-682884 treated group and 52 patients to NEURO-TTR placebo group 
• Apply the re- randomized treatment assignment to the interim data and obtain the 
standardized test stati stics T1  
• Apply the re- randomized treatment assignment to the final data and obtain the 
standardized test statistics T2  
• Repeat the above procedure N times (N = 10000) and obtain N pairs of test statistics T1 
and T2. 
• A random seed of 2855 will be used to generate N times resampling.

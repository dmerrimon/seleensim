Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/20181.1Introduc tion
1.2 Angiosar coma
Soft tissue  sarcomas account f or ~1% of adult ma lignancies. Angiosarcomas 
account for a small proportion of this 1% and arise from e ndoth elial cells [1]. 
Angiosarcomas are most common ly seen on th e face and sc alp of elderly males. 
They have also been described in the setting of chronic lymphe dema and po st- 
radiation.[ 2], [3]. Data from the US Sur veillance, Epidemiolo gy and End R esults 
registries from 1973- 1997 reported 263 subs equent cases of sarcoma in 274,572 
patients w ith breast cancer [4]. The cumula tive incidence at 15 years post br east 
cancer diagnosis w as 3.2 per 1,000 f or those who received radiation the rapy and
2.3 pe r 1,000 f or those who did not r eceive radiation the rapy (p=0.001) . Overall 
5-year survival was poor at 27-35%, how ever there was no di fference in survival 
between those who did a nd did not r eceive radiation.
Therapy is primarily surgical, how ever these tumo rs have a propensity for 
recurrence and me tastasis requiring eventual systemic therapy. Few systemic 
therapy options e xist and response rates to e xisting agents are poor. Additiona lly, 
given the rarity of angiosarcomas, studie s in s arcomas have included onl y very 
small numb ers of patients with the angiosarcoma subtype. Most  studie s have 
evaluated dox orubicin ba sed regimens with respon se rates ranging from 17% to 
34%.[5-8]. The collective experience of physicians at Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center reported a response in 8 out of 9 patients treated with pa clitaxel 
either weekly or every three weeks for angiosarcomas of the scalp and face [9]. 
Given the frequent inc orporation of radiation in t he adjuva nt treatment of breast 
cancer, the increasing incidence of breast cancer, we may see more of these 
tumor s arising from blood ve ssels in the future. It is the refore prudent to e valuate 
newer possible therapies. Evaluation of  paclitaxel in pa tients w ith me tastatic 
angiosarcoma lead to a  74 and 45% PFS at 2 and 4 months r espectively [10].
Preclinical studie s in a ngiosa rcoma tumor mode ls have show n antitumor effects 
of antiangiogenic agents. Primate vascular endothe lial growth factor 121 
(VEGF121) was expressed in an endothe lial cell line . Expression of VEGF121  
resulte d in slow growing endothe lial tumor with histology simila r to that seen in 
angiosarcoma. The endothelial cells w ere then treated with V EGFR-2 tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor SU-1498, w hich resulte d in r educed expression of transcription 
factor ets-1, which is stimula ted by VEGF [11]. Clinic al studie s evaluating agents 
with anti-angiogenic properties, suc h as sorafenib and be vacizumab have shown 
encouraging single agent activity in this  disease [12], [13].
1.2 Study D rug - Pazopanib
Numerous growth factors and cytokine s are involve d in the angiogenic process, 
i.e., the process of new blood ve ssel formation, impor tant in the developme nt and 
progression of malignancy. Among these factors, VEGF has a predomina nt role

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018as a central mediator of tumor-related angiogenesis, and its e xpression ha s been 
show n to be an adverse prognostic factor for a number of solid tumor s [14-16].
Pazopanib, be ing developed by GlaxoSmithK line (GSK) for the treatment of a 
variety of cancers, is a multi-target, sma ll mole cule inhibitor .  It is an orally- 
bioavailable, ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF receptor 
(VEGFR) (-1, -2, and -3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFR (-α and
-β), and c-Kit [17].
Clinic al data from mor e than 20 c linical Pha se I, II, and III studie s are presented 
in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) (RR2002/00017/10 ). As 
of 09 Se ptember 2010, o ver 5000 subje cts have been enrolled in p azopanib 
oncology clinical studie s conduc ted by GSK or Nationa l Cancer Institute (NCI). 
Clinic al data indic ate that (a) pazopanib is a bsorbed after oral administr ation, (b) 
the 800 mg daily dosin g regimen is an active monothe rapy dose for subje cts with 
cancer, providin g optim al biolog ic and clinical effects associated with V EGFR 
inhibition, ( c) pazopanib is g enerally well-tolerated at the 800 mg  daily dosing 
regimen, and (d) pazopanib ha s encouraging e fficacy in specific tumor settings 
such as Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) , sarcoma, Non-Small Ce ll Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC), cervical and ovarian cancer.
The most  common a dverse events (AEs) reported for pazopanib monothe rapy to 
date are diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, hypertension, ha ir color changes (hair 
depigmentation) , anorexia, vomiting , dysgeusia, headache, abdomina l pain, rash, 
aspartate aminotr ansferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increases, 
constipa tion, c ough, and arthralgia. Most of these events w ere Grade 1 or 2 using 
the Nationa l Cancer Institute-Common T oxicity Criteria of Adverse Events, 
Version 3.0 ( NCI-CTCAE v3.0) . The most f requent Grade 3 or 4 events w ere 
hypertension, f atigue, diarrhea, and A ST and A LT increases. Less common AEs 
of note include hand-foot syndrome, mucositis/sto matitis, pr oteinuria, venous 
thrombotic  events, a nd bl eeding. Intestina l perforations a nd arterial thromboses 
were uncommon.
A review of serious a dverse events (SAEs) across oncology studie s revealed tha t 
the most  frequently reported SAEs (≥ 50 e vents), regardless of causality and 
treatment regimen, as of 09 September 2010 in de creasing order of frequency 
were ALT increased, vo miting , dyspnea, abdomi nal pain, di arrhea, dehydration, 
pyrexia, fatigue, pne umonia, anemia, AST increased, na usea, pleural effusion, 
hypertension, a nd pulm onary embolism. A numbe r of these events are known 
class effects of VEGF inhibitor s.

A total of 435 subj ects were enrolled in c omple ted Study 
VEG105192 be tween 18 April 2006 a nd 24 A pril 2007. Two 
hundr ed and nine ty subje cts were randomiz ed to the pazopanib 
arm and 145 subje cts were randomiz ed to the placebo arm [18].
As of the cut-off date of 23 Ma y 2008, th e median exposur e time 
in the pazopanib a rm was 7.4 months, a lmost  twice the 3.8 months  
exposur e in the placebo arm.  T he overall inc idence of AEs 
reported dur ing the study was hig her in the  pazopanib arm (92%) 
as compa red with placebo (74%) (Table 1.1)
Most A Es were of Grade 1 or 2 inte nsity.  Mor e Grade 3 AEs were 
reported for the pazopanib arm (33%) compa red with the placebo 
arm (14%).  Grade 4 AEs were reported in 7 % of subjects in the 
pazopanib a rm and 6%  in the placebo arm. The most frequent 
Grade 3 AEs in the pazopanib a rm were ALT increased, AST 
increased, hypertension,  and dia rrhea. The rates for Grade 4 and 
Grade 5 events w ere simil ar between the pazopanib and pla cebo

pazopanib a rm, A Es associated with live r function/e nzyme 
abnormalities (including inc reased ALT, AST, hepatotoxicity, 
increased hepatic enzyme, and hyperbilirubine mia) led to 
discontinu ation of IP for 11 (3.8% ) subje cts while diarrhea led to 
discontinu ation of IP for 6 (2%) subje cts.  For 3 of the 44 subje cts

hematolog y and la boratory chemistr y abnormalities were 
simila r to those seen for VEG105192 a lone.  As of
09 January 2009, the most common A Es reported in 
subje cts receiving pazopanib inc luded dia rrhea (55%), 
hypertension  (41%), hair color changes (40%), nausea 
(32%), fatigue (29%), anorexia (24%), vomiting (21%), 
and ALT increased (17%). Most  of these events were 
Grade 1 or 2 using the NCI CTCAE Version 3.0. 
Commonl y reported AEs with the most f requent Grade 3 
classification were hypertension ( 6%), ALT increased 
(5%), and AST increased (4%).  Grade 4 and G rade 5 
events w ere infrequently reported (9% and 4%, 
respectively).
The most  common c hemistr y abnormalities included ALT, 
AST, and bilir ubin e levations, h yperglycemia and 
hypophosph atemia.  Hyperglycemia was not sig nificantly 
different in the pazopanib (41%) versus placebo (33%) arm 
of VEG105192 stud y, as of 23 Ma y 2008, su ggesting that 
hyperglycemia was unlike ly to be drug induc ed.  Most of 
these chemistr y abnormalities were Grade 1/2. The most 
common G rade 3/4 la boratory abnormalities were ALT and 
AST elevations.  A lthough le ukope nia, neutropenia, and 
thromboc ytopenia were not uncommon, G rade 3/4 
cytopenias were generally uncommon a s demonst rated in 
VEG105192 a s of 23 Ma y 2008.
The only significant urinalysis abnormality reported across 
the 3 RCC studie s as of 23 Ma y 2008 was proteinuria: 44 
subje cts (8%) reported an AE of proteinuria.  Of those 
cases, most  were Grades 1 or 2, but 5 subj ects (<1%) had 
Grade 3 proteinuria and 1 subj ect had Grade 4 proteinuria.
Rare but s evere AEs previousl y described for VEGFR 
inhibitor s, such as cardiac/cerebral ischemia, hemorrhage, 
and bow el perforation, were observed with pa zopanib 
treatment.
Across RCC  studie s as of 09 January 2009, 92 ( 16%) 
pazopanib-treated subje cts experienced AEs leading to 
discontinu ation or withdr awal from stud y.  The most 
common A E leading to disc ontinu ation f rom IP was an

AEs leading to disc ontinua tion w ere diarrhea, AST 
increased, and pr oteinuria (all 1% incidence).
In summa ry, pazopanib tr eatment in subje cts with RCC 
was generally well tole rated with an AE profile similar to 
other VEGFR inhibitor s. Most A Es were mild to mode rate 
in severity and were reversible upon inte rruption or 
discontinu ation of pazopanib.
1.2.1.1.4 Hepatotox icity
Liver enzyme abnormalities were noted early in pazopanib 
clinical developme nt and have been extensive ly evaluated. 
Close monito ring of liver markers (ALT, AST, bilir ubin, 
and alkaline phospha tase) with st rict stopping criteria was 
imple mented in pa zopanib pr otocols.  While approximately 
half of all subje cts who receive pazopanib e xperience some  
elevations in tr ansamina ses, few subje cts (4%) had 
increases to ≥ 10xULN as of 09 January 2009.  In addition, 
1% subjects had concurrent ALT and bilir ubin e levations, 
without sig nificant alkaline phosph atase elevations, tha t 
might be predictive of possible developme nt of hepatic 
functiona l impa irment.  E levations in tr ansamina ses 
typically occurred in the  first 18 w eeks of treatment. 
Hepatobili ary adverse events tha t were not la boratory 
abnormalities were less common  and live r failure and fatal 
hepatic events w ere rare.  Three fatal hepatic events 
occurred:  one  in a subje ct for which an inde pendent 
patholog y review demonstrated ma ssive hepatic 
replacement by tumor , a second in a subje ct with rapid 
disease progression in the liver (adjudic ated as unrelated to 
study drug by an ind ependent he patologist), and a third in a 
subje ct with und erlying cirrhosis w ho de veloped a fatal 
esopha geal hemorrhage (independent he patolog ist could 
not rule out c ontribution of study drug in the setting of 
unde rlying cirrhosis ).
Across the RCC  database (N=593), 107 (18%) subjects had 
an elevation in A LT ≥ 3xULN as of 09 January 2009. ALT 
is a more specific indicator of hepatocellular injur y than 
AST and w as therefore used as a single criterion for 
evaluating outcomes.  Liver enzyme elevations w ere 
reversible upon cessation of the drug and in some  cases 
while continuing on pa zopanib.  In an analysis pe rformed 
across the RCC da tabase, 96/106 ( 91%) subje cts had full 
recovery.  Recovery was defined as any ALT < 2.5xULN

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018after the first elevation i ncluding post- therapy tests.  Seven 
of the remaining 10 subj ects had limite d or no follow -up to 
determine recovery and 3 died of cancer progression w ith 
no follow -up ALT data.  It was note d early in de velopme nt 
that some  of the subje cts with elevated hepatic enzymes 
remained on stud y drug despite these elevations a nd had 
normalization of their transamina ses while remaining on 
pazopanib (“adaptation” ). Most  subje cts with tr ansamina se 
elevations in w hom dosing was inte rrupted could be 
successfully re-challenged.
For purposes of this analysis, adaptation w as defined as an 
ALT ≥ 3xULN while exposed to stud y drug follow ed by a 
return to grade 0 or baseline grade without a ny interruption 
of study drug. Subjects were conside red to h ave been re- 
challenged if they developed ALT ≥ 3xULN during 
exposur e to stud y drug which recovered to G rade 1 or 
below follow ing interruption a nd subs equently received 
study drug at either the same or reduced dos e. These 
subje cts were evaluated for recurrence of ALT 
abnormalities follow ing the re-challenge.
Adaptation:
•32 subj ects remained on study drug despite elevations 
of ALT ≥ 3xULN and experienced adaptation;
•29 (91%) without dose reduction
•3 (9%) after a dose reduction
•Median time to adaptation was 57 da ys (range 19-188 
days)
Re-challenge:
•31 subj ects who ha d a dose interruption f ollow ing a n 
ALT elevation to ≥  3xULN were re-challenged; 4 
(13%) at the same dose and 27 (87%) at a lower dose. 
The dose was reduced from 800 mg to 400 mg in 24 
subje cts and from 400 m g to 200 m g in 3 subje cts.
•Median dur ation of interruption pr ior to re-challenge 
was 19 da ys (range 5-139 days).
•The median dur ation of re-treatment among all re- 
challenge subje cts was 194 da ys (range 2-681 da ys). 
The maximum A LT before re-challenge and the latest 
ALT prior to interruption did not a ppear to correlate 
with the likelihood of recurrent elevations.

•10 (32%) subje cts had recurrent elevations
•2/10 ( 20%) subje cts with recurrent elevations  were

criteria for adaptation a s defined above.  Thus, the se 2 
subje cts are counte d both as re-challenges and as 
adaptations.
•6/10 ( 60%) positive re-challenges recovered;
•2/10 ( 20%) had ina dequate follow -up to a ssess 
recovery.
•1 (3%) subje ct had no f ollow-up da ta on the outcome of 
the re-challenge.
The remaining 45 subj ects with inc reases in A LT ≥ 3xULN 
included 10 subje cts with in adequate or absent follow-up 
data to assess recovery as well as those whose 
transamina ses did  recover either while remaining on 
pazopanib (but w ho did not  meet criteria for adaptation 
and/or  re-challenge) or after discontinu ation of pazopanib.
1.2.1.1.5 Hypertension
The cumula tive incidence of hypertension a cross the 3 
primary RCC studie s was simila r to tha t of the pazopanib- 
treated subje cts in the  VEG105192 stud y.  Two hundred 
and seventy-two (47%) out of 586 subje cts experienced an 
on-study episod e of hypertension ( defined as systolic blood  
pressure of ≥ 150 mmH g and/or diastolic blood pr essure of
≥ 100 mm Hg). These subjects did not ha ve hypertension a t 
baseline.  By Week 18, it w as note d tha t 239 of these 272 
subje cts had at least 1 e pisode of hypertension, w hich was 
87.9% of all occurrences of hypertension.  By Week 24, it 
was note d tha t 249 of 272 subje cts had at least 1 o ccurrence 
of hypertension, w hich was 91.5% of all episode s of 
hypertension  that occurred on pa zopanib dur ing the RCC 
trials.
Only 6% of the RCC pa zopanib-treated subje cts reported 
Grade 3 hypertension.  Most subje cts had a maximum 
grade of 1-2 for these events.  N o Grade 4 or 5 
hypertension  event was reported in the  RCC studi es, with 
the exception  of the Grade 4 SAE of hypertensive crisis.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/20181.2.1.1.6 Cardiac and vascular events
Cardiac and vascular events w ere categorized as follow s: 
non-vascular cardiac events inc luded arrhythmia s and 
cardiac dysfunction while vascular events inc luded arterial 
thrombotic  events (myocardial infarction/isc hemia, cerebral 
vascular accident and transient isc hemic attack [TIA]) and 
venous thr ombotic events (deep vein thr ombosis, 
pulmona ry embolus) .
In VEG105192,  the overall inc idence rate of cardiac and 
vascular events w as higher in the  pazopanib a rm compa red 
with pla cebo (10% versus 6% ).  A compr ehensive analysis 
of exposur e-adjust ed inc idence rates of cardiac and 
vascular events (a rate of ‘10 pe r 100 pa tient-years’ 
indic ates that in a  cohort of 100 pa tients each treated for 1 
year, 10 patients w ould b e expected to e xperience the event 
of interest) demonst rates a simila r incidence across placebo 
and pazopanib in V EG105192  and in the integrated RCC.
While the exposur e-adjust ed inc idence rates for all cardiac 
and vascular events w ere simila r between the 2 arms (11.99 
[CI 7.55,  16.43] per 100 patient-years in the pazopanib a rm 
compa red with 10.22 [ CI, 3.14, 17.30] in the  placebo arm), 
the exposur e-adjust ed incidence rate for Grade 5 events 
was hig her on pla cebo (1.28 ve rsus 2.55 pe r 100 p atient- 
years).  Analysis of exposur e adjuste d inc idence rates of 
arrhythmia, cardiac dysfunction ( cardiom yopathy), and 
venous thr ombotic events demonstr ate were simila r 
between the placebo and pazopanib arm of study 
VEG105192 a nd the integrated the RCC popula tion. The 
exposur e adjust ed inc idence rate of arterial thrombotic 
events w as higher in the pazopanib a rm of VEG105192 
compa red with pla cebo (3.85 [ CI 1.33, 6.37] versus 0 [CI 
could not be estima ted] per 100 pa tient years). Subjects 
who experienced the se events ha d unde rlying risk factors 
for arterial thrombotic  events including male gender, age > 
65, h ypertension, toba cco use, diabetes and peripheral 
vascular disease (PVD).
Overall for the RCC pr ogram, Q T prolongation ( > 500 
msec) occurred in 10/558 ( 1.8% ) subjects treated with 
pazopanib. Two Torsades de Point es cases have been 
identified. [Section  5.2.8.3 of the IB [RR2002/00 017/10] ].

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/20181.2.1.1.7 Hemorrhagic events
Exposur e-adjuste d hemorrhagic event rates were higher on 
the pazopanib arm of VEG105192 c ompa red with pla cebo, 
but simila r to those  seen in the integrated RCC  popula tion. 
The exposu re-adjust ed incidence rate was 15.95 ( CI 10.74, 
20.96) per 100 pa tient-years in the pazopanib a rm 
compa red to 8.94 ( CI 2.32, 15.56) in the placebo arm. 
Hemoptysis/pulmona ry hemorrhages and G I tract 
hemorrhages were the most common SA Es reported. 
Association to  know n me tastases was note d for 4 of the 5 
hemopt ysis/pulmona ry hemorrhagic SAEs and 3 of the 7 
GI tract hemorrhagic SAEs.  The most  common 
hemorrhagic event was epista xis. Life-threatening and fatal 
hemorrhagic events were uncommon a cross both the RCC 
and monothe rapy popula tions.
1.2.1.1.8 Thyroid function a bnormalities
Increases in th yroid stimul ating hormone (TSH) are 
commonl y noted in RCC subje cts receiving pazopanib 
(29%).  Most of these subjects do not a ppear to de velop 
clinically overt hypothyroidism.  Clin ical hypothyroidism 
manifested as elevated T4 was noted in 6% of subjects. 
The hypothyroidism  AE incidence rate was also low (4- 
7%) and simil ar between VEG105192 a nd across the RCC 
studie s for pazopanib-treated subje cts.
Hyperthyroidism oc curs infrequently (1%) and the 
incidence was not si gnificantly different in subje cts 
receiving pazopanib c ompared to those  receiving pla cebo 
on stud y VEG105192.
1.2.1.1.9 Bowel Perforations a nd Enteral Fistula e
In the RCC popula tion, 5 subje cts (0.9% ) suffered SAEs 
related to G I perforations or fistula e. The 5 events were 
described as follows: ile al perforation ( n=1), large intestine 
perforation ( n=2), peritonitis se conda ry to inte stina l 
perforation ( n=1), and enterocutaneous fistula (n=1).  Two 
of these events, la rge intestine perforation a nd pe ritonitis 
seconda ry to inte stina l perforation w ere fatal. One event of 
large intestina l perforation was associated with 
diverticulitis.  T hree events of perforation w ere related to 
unde rlying tumor .

1.2.1.2 Subje cts with sof t tissue  sarcoma (STS)
1.2.1.2.1 Conc luded Study  VEG20002: Pha se II Study of 
GW786034 in  Patients w ith Re lapsed or Refractory Soft 
Tissue Sarcoma (European Organization f or Research and 
Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] Study)
As of 09 September 2008 , enrollme nt was comple ted with 
142 a dult subje cts enrolled. Sa fety and efficacy analyses 
were compl eted by the European Organization f or Research 
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and de scribed in a 
synoptic clinical pharmacology study report, with effective 
date of 24 Se ptember 2008, and publishe d by Sleijfer et al 
[19].
1.2.1.2.2 Adverse events
All 142 subj ects received pazopanib 800 mg once daily. AE 
data were available for all 142  subje cts. The most  frequent 
clinical adverse events (AEs) (≥ 30% ), regardless of 
causality, were fatigue (70%), nausea (46%), diarrhea 
(46%), hypertension ( 45%), decreased appetite (39%), skin
hypopigmentation (37%), vomiting (36%), weight
decreased (31%), dyspnea (31%), cough (30%), and
constipa tion ( 30%).
1.2.1.2.3 Subjects withdr awn due  to adverse events 
There were 9 subjects (6.3%) who ha d the IP withdr awn
due to an AE. Four of the 9 subje cts had IP withdr awn for 
elevation in tr ansamina se. Elevation in tr ansaminase was 
the single most c ommon cause of IP discontinua tion. O ther 
events tha t lead to disc ontinua tion of  IP were dissemina ted 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), pulmona ry embolism, 
hypertension, he moptysis and se vere back pain, and bow el 
perforation w ith pe ritonitis.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018publishe d in 2009 [ 19]. Treatment response data are available for 138 
subje cts who received pazopanib 800 mg once daily. Ninety-nine percent 
of subje cts had received prior chemothe rapy: 35 s ubjects (25%) had 
received the rapy in a (neo)-adjuva nt setting, 83 ( 59%) had received 
therapy in an advanced setting, and 22 ( 16%) had received both.
The primary endpoint w as the progression- free rate, using  Response 
Evaluation C riteria in Solid  Tumor s (RECIST) at 12 w eeks after start of 
treatment. Pa tients with le iomyosarcoma, synovia l sarcoma and “the other 
types of sarcoma” strata receiving pazopanib in V EG20002  experienced a 
12 w eek progression f ree rate of ≥ 40% , the pre-defined threshold 
indic ating anti-tumor activity. The liposa rcoma stratum did not m eet its 
prespecified endpoint a t the end of stage 1 and did not pr ogress to sta ge 2. 
Based on th e results of the VEG20002, a Phase III randomi zed, double 
blind, pla cebo controlled study (VEG110727) of pazopanib versus placebo 
in subj ects with sof t tissu e sarcoma (study excluded patients w ith G IST or 
liposa rcoma) was initia ted in 2008. V EG110727 ha s comple ted patient 
enrollme nt and da ta are expected in 2011.
1.3Study Rationale
Pazopanib ha s show n encouraging activity in a previous pha se II trial in c ertain 
sarcoma subtypes. In the phase II trial of pazopanib as described above ,  
condu cted by the EORTC, the progression f ree rate at 12 w eeks exceeded 40% for 
patients w ith leiomyosarcomas, synovial cell sarcomas, and othe r eligible 
sarcomas, but not lipos arcomas. In the group o f other sarcomas, five were 
described as vascular sarcomas.
We hypothe size that pazopanib w ill ha ve therapeutic activity in angiosarcoma 
because they are derived from e ndothe lial cells[1], and pa zopanib is a n anti- 
angiogenic agent. In addition, a gents w ith anti-angiogenic properties have shown 
single agent activity in this dise ase. Sor afenib has been show n to ha ve a 14% 
response rate in angiosarcomas in pr eviousl y treated patients in the phase II 
setting[12]. Bevacizumab has demonstr ated a 12% response  rate [13]. Given the 
limite d data on the  activity of pazopanib in a ngiosarcomas, we propose to 
evaluate its activity in pa tients with angiosarcoma.
1.4Correlative Testing
Pazopanib is  believed to f unction a s an anti-angiogenic agent given its a ctivity 
against the VEGFR 1-3 as well as PD GFRA and B kinases. We hypothesize that 
the agent will be effective in tumor s that are unde rgoing angiogenesis. 
Angiosarcoma is derived from e ndothe lial cells and its g rowth has been shown to 
be inhibite d by anti-angiogenic agents, a nd thus t he tumor itself appears to mimic 
angiogenesis. However, it would be clinically useful to be able to predict whether 
a tumor will or will not r espond to a ngiogenic inhibitor s, as well as have an early 
read out on e fficacy of such an agent prior to evidence of response  from size

predicting this are in de velopme nt, but ha ve not b een studie d systematically. We 
therefore propose to explore the ability of PET imaging with [F-18] FDG PET/CT 
to assess angiosarcomas prior to and follow ing ongoing therapy with pa zopanib to 
determine changes in me tabolic response as an early marker of response to 
pazopanib.

5.1Treatment Plan
Treatment will be  admini stered on a n out- patient ba sis. T reatment will be administe red as 
described below.  Dose delays and modif ications will only be done  follow ing protocol 
guidelines described in s ection 6.0.  If treatment delays are > 28 da ys stud y therapy will 
be discontinue d. Each treatment cycle after cycle 1 is 21 da ys +/- 5 calendar days for 
holida ys, inclement weather and/or other scheduling conflict. Treatment should  continue 
during the 5 day window for cycle evaluation should a particular cycle need to be 
extended due to a scheduling conflict.

crushed or broken. The time of day the tablets are taken should be  relatively 
constant.
If a subje ct misse s a dose, the subje ct should ta ke the dose as soon  as possi ble, but 
not le ss tha n 12 hour s before the next dose is due .  If the next dose is due in less 
than 12 hour s, the subje ct should skip the misse d dose and ta ke the next dose as 
scheduled.
If a subje ct vomits a fter taking pazopanib, the subje ct will be instructed not  to 
take another dose that day.  The subject will resume taking pazopanib at the next 
scheduled dose .  If vomiting persists, the subje ct will be  instructed to notif y the

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/20185.3Dosing R ationale
Pazopanib 800  mg once daily is the recomme nded monothe rapy dose based on 
clinical and pr eclinical results.  O nce daily doses of 50 mg to 2000 m g pazopanib 
were investigated in the  “First Time in Human”, Phase I Study VEG10003. (IB 
RR2002/00017/10)  Increases in the  pazopanib do se above 800 m g once daily 
when administ ered in the fasted state did not r esult in a consiste nt inc rease in 
systemic exposur e at steady-state.  Therefore, no f urther benefit is e xpected at 
pazopanib dose s above  800 mg once daily.
Pharmacodynamic data indicate that pazopanib, a t a monothe rapy dose of 800 mg 
once daily, results in e ffects consist ent with inhibi tion of the VEGF receptors it 
was designed to ta rget.  Conc entration- effect relationships w ere observed between 
trough plasma pazopanib concentrations a nd the developme nt of hypertension in  
Study VEG10003  and th e percent change from b aseline in sVEGFR2 na dir in 
Study VEG102616.   The trough pla sma pazopanib c oncentrations a ssociated with 
one-half the maximal effect (EC50) in both c oncentration-effect relationships w ere 
simila r (21.3 µg/mL and 15.3 µg/mL) and de mons trate that there is a consis tent 
inhibition of VEGF receptor(s) in subje cts with cancer when pla sma pazopanib 
concentrations a re maintained above 15 µg/mL.  The plasma pazopanib EC50 
values for biolo gic effects obse rved in the  clinical studie s are simila r to the 
plasma concentration of 40 µM (17.5 µg/mL) required for optima l inhibition of 
VEGFR-2 phospho rylation in mic e [GSK Report RH2003/00005/00] .
Progression F ree Survival (PFS) in subje cts with renal cell cancer in Stud y 
VEG102616 w as compared between subj ects whose trough plasma pazopanib 
concentrations ( Cmin) at Week 4 w ere above or below selected threshold va lues. 
The deciles of the observed Cmin values were selected as threshold va lues so th at 
approximately equal num bers of subje cts were included in e ach C min interval. 
Subje cts with a Cmin at Week 4 a bove the threshold values had significantly better 
PFS, compared to the remaining subje cts, w hen the  threshold c oncentrations were
12.6 µg/mL, 17.4 µg/mL, and 20.6 µg/mL.  Use of thresholds hi gher than
21 µg/mL did not r esult in a significant impr ovement in PF S between patients 
with C min values above  and be low the threshold.   Patients w ith C min concentrations 
above  20.6 µg/mL also h ad a significantly better response rate and tumor 
shrinkage than the remaining patients.
Pazopanib C24 a t steady-state was greater than 15 µg/mL in 93% of subje cts who 
received 800 mg once daily in Stud y VEG10003.  Individua l subje cts receiving 
pazopanib dose s below 800 mg once daily can achieve plasma concentrations 
over 15 µg/mL, albeit at a lower frequency compa red with w hat is obs erved at 
800 mg once daily.  Therefore, the pharmacokine tic and pha rmacodynamic results 
across clinical studie s demonstr ate that pazopanib 800 mg once daily results in 
plasma concentrations tha t provide  optima l biologic  effects associated with 
VEGFR inhibition  in the greatest proportion of subjects.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/20185.3Concomitant Medications, su pportive care and e xcluded therapies and 
restrictions
5.3.1 Permitted Medications
All subj ects will be  asked to pr ovide a comple te list of prescription a nd 
over-the-counte r medications tha t have been taken within the 2 weeks 
prior to Screening.  The investigator must  be informed as soon a s possible 
about a ny new medication(s) taken from the time of Screening until the 
comple tion of the post- treatment follow -up visit.
All concomitant me dications ta ken dur ing the study will be recorded in the 
case report form (CRF) with indic ation, dose information, a nd da tes of 
administr ation.
Subje cts should r eceive full suppor tive care during the study, includin g 
transfusion  of blood a nd blood pr oduc ts, and treatment with antibioti cs, 
analgesics, erythropoie tin (per ASCO guidelines), or bisphosphona tes, 
when appropriate.
Antiemetics (such as prochlorperazine, lorazepam, onda nsetron or other 5- 
HT antagonists) may be administe red prophylactically in the event of 
nausea. Anti-diarrheals, suc h as lope ramide , may be administe red as 
needed in the event of diarrhea. (See Appendix F for Suppor tive care 
guidelines for nausea/vomiting and dia rrhea)  Althoug h acetaminophe n at 
doses of ≤ 2 g/day is permitte d, it should be used with caution in subje cts 
with impa ired liver function. G lucocorticosteroids may be used as 
antiemetics and me gestrol acetate may be used for appetite.
5.3.2 Permitted Medications – U se with Caution 
Specific recommendat ions regarding ant icoagulant s:
Results f rom dr ug-drug interaction studie s conduc ted in subje cts with 
cancer suggest tha t pazopanib ha s no e ffect on th e metabolism  of S- 
warfarin.  Hemorrhagic events, how ever, have been reported in c linical 
studie s with pa zopanib; t herefore, pazopanib shou ld be used with caution 
in subj ects with inc reased risk o f severe bleeding or who are receiving 
concomita nt anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin or its de rivatives, low 
mole cular weight he parin, unfractiona ted heparin).  Subje cts taking 
concomita nt anticoagulant therapy should be monitored regularly for 
changes in relevant coagulation pa rameters as clinically indic ated, as well 
as for any clinical bleeding episod es.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Specific recommendat ions r egarding hypogly cemic therapy including 
insuli n:
Results f rom dr ug-drug interaction studie s conduc ted in subje cts with 
cancer suggest tha t there will be no clinically relevant pha rmacokinetic 
interaction be tween pazopanib a nd hypoglycemic agents.  T ransient 
decreases in se rum glucose (mainly Grade 1 and 2, rarely Grade 3) have 
been obse rved in c linical studie s with pa zopanib. In addition, de creases in 
blood su gar have been recently reported in subje cts treated with anothe r 
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor , sunitini b [20]. Such changes may 
require an adjustm ent in the dose of hypoglycemic and/or  insulin th erapy. 
Subje cts will be  advise d to report symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., 
confusion,  visua l distu rbances, palpitations,  sweating).  Serum glucose 
will be tested dur ing treatment with pa zopanib a s outlin ed in s ection 9.2 
study calendar and as clinically indic ated.
5.3.2.1 The  Effects of Pazopanib  on Other Drugs
In vitro data indic ate that pazopanib is a potential inhibitor  for 
CYP3A4, CY P2C8, CY P2D6, CY P1A2, CYP2C9 , CYP2C19,
CYP2A6, CY P2B6, and CY P2E1.  Pregnane X receptor transient 
transfection a ssay suggested some potential for human CY P3A4 
induc tion a t high concentrations. Results f rom dr ug-drug 
interaction studie s condu cted in subje cts with cancer suggest tha t 
pazopanib is a  weak inhi bitor of CYP3A4, CY P2C8,  and CY P2D6 
in vivo, but ha d no c linically relevant effect on CY P1A2, CY P2C9 
or CYP2C19  metabolis m. Therefore, concomita nt use of 
pazopanib w ith certain medications ( subst rates of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, a nd CYP2D6) with a narrow therapeutic window will be 
unde rtaken with C AUTION  due to the  potential for alterations  in 
the pharmacologic effects of these medications or an inc reased risk 
for serious or life threatening adverse events associated with su ch 
medications ( see below) seconda ry to the inhibition  of specific 
CYP enzymes by pazopanib.  In addition, the potential for drug 
interaction w ith such me dications, a lthoug h diminishe d, ma y 
persist a fter the last dose of pazopanib due to its long half-life (i.e., 
mean 30.9 hour s); therefore, continue to exercise CAUTION for at 
least 7 da ys and up to  15 days after the last dose of pazopanib 
when administ ering these medications. These medications  include 
(but are not limite d to):
•Ergot derivatives: dihydroergotamine , ergonovin e, ergotamine , 
methylergonovin e (potential increased risk for developing   
ergot tox icity that includes severe vasospa sm leading to 
peripheral as well as cerebral ischemia)

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018•Neuroleptics: pimoz ide (potential increased risk for QT 
interval prolongation, ventricular arrhythmia , and sudde n 
death)
•Antiarrhythmic s: bepridil, f lecainide , lidoc aine, mexiletine, 
amioda rone, quinidine , propafenone (potential increased risk 
for QT interval prolonga tion and Torsades de Pointe s)
•Immune  modula tors: cyclospor ine, tacrolimus,  sirolimus 
(potential increased risk for nephrotoxicity and ne urotoxicity)
•Misc ellaneous: que tiapine, risperidone , clozapine, atomo xetine.
5.3.2.2 The Effects of Other Food and  Drugs on Pazopanib
Results f rom in v itro stu dies sug gest tha t the oxidative metabolism 
of pazopanib in huma n live r microsome s is me diated primarily by 
CYP3A4, with minor contributions f rom C YP1A2 and CY P2C8. 
Furthermore, in vitro da ta sugge st tha t pazopanib is a  substr ate for 
p-glycoprotein.  Subst ances that induc e or inhibit CY P3A4 ma y 
alter the pharmacologic effects of pazopanib a nd will be used with 
CAUTION .
Foods a nd me dications  that inhibit C YP3A4 ma y result in 
increased pla sma pazopanib c oncentrations.  C o-administration 
of strong C YP3A4 inhibit ors is prohibi ted (see Section on 
Prohibite d Me dications) ; therefore selection of an alternate 
concomita nt me dication with no or  minima l pote ntial to inhibit 
CYP3A4 is r ecomme nded.
CYP3A4 induc ers may decrease plasma pazopanib c oncentrations. 
Selection of an alternate concomita nt me dication with no or 
minima l enzyme induc tion pote ntial is recomme nded.  Drugs that 
induc e CYP3A4 and ma y decrease pazopanib pla sma 
concentrations inc lude (but are not limite d to):
•Glucocorticoids:  c ortisone (>50 m g), hydrocortisone (>40 
mg), prednisone (>10 mg) , methylprednisolone (>8 mg ), 
dexamethasone (>1.5 m g)
•Anticonvulsa nts:  phe nytoin, c arbamazepine, 
phenoba rbital, oxcarbazepine
•HIV antivir als:  e favirenz, nevirapine
•Antibiotic s:  rifampin ( rifampic in), rifabutin, r ifapentine

5.5Duration of Follow up
After discontinu ation of  the study treatment, subje cts will remain on the study for 
follow-up assessments of disease status and upda tes on a nti-cancer treatments 
until de ath or for a maximum of two years from the date of the last subje ct 
enrolled. Pa tients remove d from stud y for unacceptable study related adverse

resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
5.6Criteria for discontinuat ion
Patients will be remove d from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.4 
applie s or if they are lost to follow -up. In addition deviation( s) from the protocol 
may be a cause for discontinua tion. The primary reason for study removal and the 
date the patient was removed must  be documented in the medical record and case 
report form. If treatment is discontinue d for a scheduled surgery, pazopanib must 
be held at least 7 da ys prior to the scheduled sur gery.
6.1Dose modifications
6.2General principles
At each visit du ring the Treatment Pe riod, subj ects will first be evaluated for the 
occurrence of AEs and laboratory abnormalities.  The potential causes of the AEs 
will be thoroughly investigated and confoundin g factors identified and elimina ted 
whenever possible .  Some AEs, althou gh rare, can result in sig nificant clinical 
consequence such as arterial/venal thrombosis, se vere hemorrhage, bow el 
perforation a nd se vere fatigue/asthenia, therefore will be promptl y identified and 
managed.
Should a patient require scheduled sur gery while on stud y, pazopanib must be 
discontinu ed for at least 7 days prior to sur gery. Follow ing the surgery, adequate 
would he aling must  be determine d by the treating ph ysician, in order for the 
patient to r esume pazopanib tr eatment in this tr ial.
The Nationa l Cancer Institute Common T erminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events 
Version 4.0 ( NCI-CTCAE, v.4) must be used to G rade the severity of AEs except 
for hypertension and pa lmar-plantar Erythrodysesthesia Syndrome: grading for 
these events is de scribed in the table below. Specific recomme ndations  for 
management of these possible AEs along w ith guidelines for dose interruption,

6.4Dose Interruptions/ Modifications for Hepatotoxicity
Recomme ndations f or pazopanib dose interruptions/modif ications in  case of liver- 
related treatment-emergent AEs are provided in T able 6.2. As a general rule, 
since many subje cts are taking multiple concurrent medications, it is c ritical to (a) 
do a thorough evaluation of the subje ct’s concurrent me dications ( ensuring all are 
recorded in the  CRF ), and (b) identify and disc ontinue those with know n 
hepatotox icity and replace with a non-hepatotox ic equivalent for the same 
indic ation if  necessary.  Record alcohol use is recorded on the  histor y and 
physical form in the CRF binde r.  Liver dysfunction must be  fully evaluated even 
if clinical signs and symptoms indic ate progression of liver tumor lesions.  
Imaging studie s must be obtained to doc ument pote ntial progression of 
malignancy.

7.5Treatment of Inve stigational  Product Overdose
No maximum to lerated dose (MTD) was reached in the  dose escalation study  of 
pazopanib a dministe red as a single agent at repeated dose s of up to 2000m g/day 
(Study VEG10003 ). Systemic exposur e to pa zopanib a t steady-state appeared to 
plateau at dose s greater than 800 mg once daily.  Increases in the daily pazopanib 
dose above 800 m g in the fasted state resulte d in a small or no inc rease in mean 
systemic exposur e to pa zopanib.
In the event of pazopanib ove rdose (defined as administr ation of more than the 
protocol-specified dos e), the investigator will contact the Principal Investiga tor. 
Decisions r egarding pazopanib dose  modif ications or interruptions w ill be made 
by the investigator in consulta tion w ith the Principal Investigator based on the  
clinical evaluation of the subje ct.
Following a n ove rdose, additiona l monitor ing of the subject for AEs/SA Es and 
laboratory abnormalities will be conside red. A plasma sample  for 
pharmacokine tic analysis for pazopanib ma y be requested by the Principal 
Investigator on a case-by-case basis. This pla sma sample will be collected as 
soon a s possible , but w ithin 7 da ys from the date of the last dose of study drug. 
Information regarding the quantity of the excess dose, as well as the duration of 
overdosin g, will be  documented in the CRF .
8.0 C orrelative /Special Studies
8.1.Hypot hesis
Pazopanib is  believed to f unction a s an anti-angiogenic agent given its a ctivity 
against the VEGFR 1-3 as well as PD GFRA and B kinases. We hypothesize that 
the agent will be effective in tumor s that are unde rgoing angiogenesis. 
Angiosarcoma is derived from e ndothe lial cells and its g rowth has been shown to 
be inhibite d by anti-angiogenic agents, a nd thus t he tumor itself appears to mimic 
angiogenesis. However, it would be clinically useful to be able to predict whether 
a tumor will or will not r espond to a ngiogenic inhibitor s, as well as have an early 
read out on e fficacy of such an agent prior to evidence of response  from size 
based ima ging technique s suc h as CT or MRI. Reliable means of potentially 
predicting this are in de velopme nt, but ha ve not b een studie d systematically. We 
therefore propose to explore the ability of PET imaging with [F-18]RDG-K5 to 
assess angiosarcomas prior to and follow ing ongoing therapy with pa zopanib to 
determine changes in a ngiogenesis as an early marker of response  to pazopanib as 
compa red with [F-18] FDG PET/CT and CT imaging.

8.3.3 Analyt ic plan
The objective of the study is to examine how [F-18] FDG PET/CT as an 
imaging agent may be able to predict efficacy or early response  as 
compa red with CT imaging. Analyses will be made by Dr. Yu at Fox 
Chase Cancer Center utilizing individua l lesions with a minimum of one 
lesion per patient up to a maximum of five lesions  per patient. G iven the  
patient popula tion w ith me tastatic disease, it is a nticipated we will be 
analyzing up to 50 le sions.  PET images will be scored using the follow ing 
criteria:
Score = 0 D isease progression (< - 20% ); Defined as the percentage 
change in SU V values in each paired ima ge assessment to be less than a 
negative 20%, when baseline images are compa red to w eek 4 ima ges 
Score = 1 N o response ( 20% to > - 20% ); Defined as the percentage 
change in SU V values in each paired ima ge assessment to be less than 
20% up to g reater than or equal to a negative 20%, when baseline images 
are compared to w eek 4 images
Score = 2 Partial response (> 20% to < 50% ); Defined as the percentage 
change in SU V values in each paired ima ge assessment to be between > 
20% and < 50%, when baseline images are compared to week 4 ima ges 
Score = 3 Suc cessful response (> 50% to <90 %); Defined as the 
percentage change in SU V values in e ach paired ima ge assessme nt to be 
between > 50% and < 90%, when baseline images are compared to w eek 4 
images
Score = 4 C omplete response (> 90% ); Defined as the percentage 
change in SU V values in each paired ima ge assessment to be >90%, when 
baseline images are compared to w eek 4 ima ges CT imaging will utiliz e 
RESIST criteria and w ill also doc ument changes in H ouns field units  
utiliz ing the baseline and the week 12 stu dies; if a patient progresses at the 
week 6 ima ging time point,  the week six study will be used.
If a lesion is not de tected on the pre treatment [F-18] FDG PET image
/CT or diagnostic  CT image), the score for the paired ima ge sets will be 
defined as not inte rpretable.
The descriptive statistics will inc lude mean, SD, median, minimum,  and 
maximum  for continuous variables and th e numbe rs and pe rcentages for 
categorical variables. The statistic al test will be two sid ed at the 0.05 le vel 
of significance with 95% confidence limit. T he score of each variable will 
be calculated as an average of the lesion le vel score for each patient. 
Imaging data for SUVs, tumor to ba ckground r atios, le sion size, score will 
be analyzed and pr esented individua lly.

the changes in pr imary endpoints w ill be  presented.
The change in ima ges (i.e., [ [F-18]FDG PET SUV or Diagnostic CT 
tumor size changes) will be compute d as the baseline value (pre-treatment) 
minus the appropriate post baseline (after mid-treatment) value. Cha nges 
from p re-treatment va lues in SU Vs and ta rget-to-background r atios, a nd 
qualitative scores for change in lesion upta ke at each of the time-points  
will be explored for their ability to predict patient response to therapy.
The change in ima ges (i.e.,  [F-18]FDG PET SUV or Diagnostic CT tumor 
size changes) will be  computed as the baseline value (pre-treatment) minus  
the on treatment va lue. Cha nges from pr e-treatment va lues in SUVs and 
target-to-background ratios, a nd qua litative scores for change in lesion 
uptake will be explored for their ability to predict patient response to 
treatment.
The statistic for determining the correlation be tween the  [F-18] FDG 
PET/CT and othe r imaging moda lities is the  Pearson's correlation 
coefficient. If the assumption of normality does not hold, th en Spearman's 
rank correlation c oefficient will be compute d. Pearson's correlation 
coefficients and the  corresponding 2-sided 90%  confidence intervals will 
be compute d for the change in [F-18] FDG PET/CT and the change in 
Diagnostic  CT from ba seline to on tr eatment ima ging (4 week/ 12 w eek 
for FDG PET and CT respectively). If the lower bound  of the confidence 
interval is >0.4, the n it w ill be concluded tha t the given pair of SUVs are 
correlated. In addition  to Pearson's correlation c oefficient, graphical 
displa ys of the data will be provide d. All othe r seconda ry and exploratory 
correlations  will be  analyzed in the same manner as the primary 
correlations
FDG-PET While FDG-PET response assessme nts need additiona l stud y, 
it is som etimes reasonable to inc orporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to 
comple ment CT scanning in assessment of progression ( particularly 
possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the follow ing algorithm:
a.Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow - 
up is a  sign of PD based on a new lesion.
b.No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by CT, this  is PD . If the positive FDG-PET at 
follow -up is  not c onfirmed as a new site of disease on CT , addition al 
follow -up CT  scans are needed to de termine if there is truly

PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT  
that is not  progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is 
not PD .
c.FDG-PET may be used to upg rade a response to a CR in a manner 
simila r to a biops y in cases where a residua l radiographic 
abnormality is thou ght to r epresent fibrosis or scarring. The use of 
FDG-PET in this c ircumstance will be prospectively described in the 
protocol and suppor ted by disease-specific medical literature for the 
indic ation.  H owever, it must be acknow ledged that both  approaches 
may lead to f alse positive CR due to limita tions of FDG-PET and

9.1Study Assessments and P rocedures
A signed, written informed consent and HIPAA consent form must be obtained from the 
subje ct prior to any study-specific procedures or assessme nts. Pr ocedures conduc ted as 
part of the subje ct’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count,  imaging study) and 
obtained prior to sig ning of informed consent ma y be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided these procedures are condu cted as specified in the protocol. The study 
assessme nts sc hedules and visit w indow s are summa rized below. Refer to Section 9.2, 
the Study C alendar  for a complete list and schedule.

10.1 Adverse Event
10.2 Definitions
10.2.1 Adverse Events (AE)
An Adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and un intended sig n (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding ), symptom or disease tempor ally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) produc t, treatment 
or procedure regardless of whether it is c onside red related to the medical 
treatment or procedure (NCI CTEP Guidelines March 28, 2011 )
10.2.2 Serious A dverse Event (SAE)
Serious A dverse Event (SAE) is an AE that is fatal or life threatening, 
requires inpa tient hospit alization or prolongation of existing 
hospita lization ( for > 24 hou rs), persistent or significant incapacity or 
substa ntial disr uption of the ability to condu ct normal life functions,  or is a 
congenital anoma ly/ birth defect, or results in a ny impor tant medical event 
that may not result in de ath, be life threatening, or require hospita lization 
may be conside red an SA E when, ba sed upon appropriate medical 
judgment, m ay jeopardize the subje ct and ma y require medical or surgical 
intervention to pr event any of the above  outcomes. A “life-threatening” 
adverse event pla ces the patient at imm ediate risk of death in the judgment 
of the investiga tor or sponsor.
10.2.3 Severity Rating
The investigator will evaluate the severity of each adverse event. NCI 
Common T erminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4.0) or 
study specific toxicity tables provide d in the protocol de fine severity.  If 
not inc luded in CT CAE v.4.0,  severity is expressed in numerical grade 
using the follow ing definitions:
•Grade 1: Mild- asympto matic or mild s ymptoms; c linical or diagnostic 
observations onl y; inte rvention  not indic ated.
•Grade 2: Mode rate-minima l, loc al or noninva sive intervention 
indic ated; limiting age appropriate instrumental ADL.
•Grade 3: Se vere-severe or medically significant but not  imme diately 
life-threatening; hospita lization or prolong ation of  hospita lization 
indic ated; disa bling ; limiting self care ADL.

•Unlike ly – doubtf ully related
•Unrelated – clearly not related
10.2.5 Expectedness
An Expected Adverse Event is one where the specificity or severity is 
consiste nt with the current inf ormation a vailable from the resources.
An Unexpected Adverse Event is one where the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is related to pa rticipation in  the research is not 
consiste nt with either:
1.The know n or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the 
procedures involv ed in the research that are described in (a) the 
protocol-related doc uments, suc h as the IRB-approved research 
protocol, any applic able investigator brochure, and the current IRB- 
approved informed consent doc ument, and (b) other relevant sour ces 
of information, su ch as produc t labeling and pa ckage inserts: or
2.The expected natural progression of any unde rlying disease, 
disor der, or condition  of the subje ct (s) experiencing the adverse 
event and the  subje cts(s) predisposing  risk factor profile for the 
adverse event.

10.3 Recording R esponsibilit ies
10.3.1 Investiga tive site recording responsibilitie s:
Upon identification of an AE or SAE, the site investigator will utiliz e the 
above  definitions to pr operly classify the event.  E ach category listed 
above  must be recorded for each event.
All AEs and SA Es will be recorded in the “AE case report forms” (CRF ) 
and in progress reports with de tails about the grade and attribution  of each 
episod e, action ta ken with respect to the  study drug, and the patient’s 
outcome will be recorded in the CRF. All events will be recorded on c ase

11.1 Measures of Effect
Response Evaluat ion Criteria in Solid Tum ors (RECIST)
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumor s (RECIST 1.1) criteria will be used for 
objective tumor response assessme nt. Assessme nts will be performed after every two 
cycles of treatments. Once protocol treatment has been comple ted subjects will be assessed 
every three months or soon er as indi cated and judge d by treating physicians.
11.2 Definitions.
Evaluable for objective response .  Only those patients w ho ha ve measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease re-evaluated will be conside red evaluable for response .  These 
patients w ill have their response classified according to the definitions  stated 
below. (Note: Patients who exhibit obje ctive disease progression  prior to the end 
of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response . Patients who ha ve lesions pr esent at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not me et the definitions of measurable disease, 
have received at least on e cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- 
evaluated will be conside red evaluable for non-target disease. The respons e 
assessme nt is ba sed on th e presence, absence, or unequivoc al progression of the 
lesions.
11.3 Disease Parameters
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions a re defined as those  that can be 
accurately measured in a t least one dime nsion ( longest diameter to be recorded) as
>20 mm b y chest x-ray, as >10 mm  with CT scan, or >10 mm w ith calipers by 
clinical exam.  A ll tumor measurements must be recorded in millime ters (or 
decimal fractions of centime ters).
Note:  Tumor lesions  that are situated in a  previously irradiated area might or 
might not  be conside red measurable.  Sarcomas arising in a previousl y irradiated 
site will be conside red measurable. Sarcoma lesions tha t have been treated with 
therapeutic intent will be conside red me asurable if they have increased in size by 
more than 20% .
Malignant lymph node s.  To be conside red pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph nod e must be >15 mm in shor t axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recomme nded to be no greater than 5 mm) .  At 
baseline and in f ollow -up, only the short axis will be  measured and follow ed.
11-042
Copyright©2011 Fox Chase Cancer Center® Ex tramural Research Program (ERP). All rights reserved.
Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Non-measurable disease.  All othe r lesions  (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions ( longest dia meter <10 mm or patholog ical lymph node s with ≥ 10 to  <15 
mm sho rt axis), are conside red non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions,  
leptome ningeal dise ase, ascites, ple ural/pericardial effusions, l ympha ngitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflamma tory breast dise ase, and abdomina l masses (not 
followed by CT or MRI), are consid ered as non- measurable.
Note: Cystic lesions  that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts will not be consid ered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- 
measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be conside red as 
measurable lesions, if  they meet the definition o f measurability described above . 
However, if non-cystic lesions a re present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection a s target lesions.
Target lesions. All me asurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions  per organ 
and 5 lesions in tota l, representative of all involve d organs, will be identified as 
target lesions a nd recorded and me asured at baseline.  Target lesions w ill be 
selected on the  basis of their size (lesions  with the longest dia meter), be 
representative of all involve d organs, but in a ddition should be those that lend 
themselves to r eproducible repeated me asurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion doe s not le nd itse lf to reproduc ible measurement in 
which circumst ance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproduc ibly 
will be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longe st for non-noda l lesions, s hort axis 
for noda l lesions) for all target lesions w ill be  calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum dia meters.  If lymph nod es are to be included in the sum, the n onl y 
the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum dia meters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the  measurable 
dime nsion  of the disease.
Non-target lesions.  A ll other lesions  (or sites of disease) includin g any 
measurable lesions ove r and above the 5 target lesions will be identified as non- 
target lesions a nd w ill also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these 
lesions a re not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases une quivocal 
progression of each will be noted throughout f ollow -up.
11.4 Methods f or Evaluat ion of Measur able Disease
All me asurements will be  taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations  will be performed as closely as possible  to the 
beginnin g of treatment and ne ver more than 4 w eeks be fore the beginnin g of the

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Imaging-based evaluation is pr eferred to e valuation b y clinical examination 
unless the lesion(s) being follow ed cannot be imaged but a re assessable by 
clinical exam.
Clinic al lesions   Clini cal lesions w ill onl y be considered me asurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodule s and pa lpable lymph node s) and ≥10 mm 
diameter as assessed usin g calipers (e.g., skin nodule s).  In the  case of skin 
lesions, doc umentation by color photogr aphy, including a ruler to estima te the 
size of the lesion, is  recommended.
CT and MRI This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption tha t CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum s ize for a measurable lesion will 
be twice the slice thickness.  M RI is also acceptable in certain situ ations ( e.g. for 
body scans).
As with C T, if an MR I is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used will be  optimiz ed for the evaluation of the type and site  of 
disease. Furthermore, as with CT , the moda lity used at follow-up w ill be the 
same as was used at baseline and the lesions  will be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond th e scope of the RECIST guidelines to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, bod y parts, 
and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner will be used and the image 
acquisition pr otocol will be follow ed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body 
scans will be performed with br eath-hold sc anning technique s, if possible .
11.5 Response Criteria 
Evaluat ion o f Target Lesions
Comple te Response (CR):Disappearance of all target lesions.   Any pathologi cal 
lymph node s (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in  short axis to
<10 mm.
Partial Response  (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, ta king a s reference the baseline sum dia meters
Progressive Disease (PD):At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, ta king a s reference the smallest sum on stud y (this inc ludes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on stu dy).  In addition to  the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must  also de monst rate an absolute increase of at least 5 m m. 
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also conside red 
progressions) .
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shr inkage to qua lify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qua lify for PD, taking a s reference the smallest sum dia meters while 
on stud y

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Evaluat ion o f Non-Target Lesions
Comple te Response (CR):Disappearance of all non -target lesions  and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph node s must be non-pathological 
in siz e (<10 mm shor t axis)
Note:  If tumor markers are initia lly above the upper normal limit,  they must 
normalize for a patient to be conside red in c omple te clinical response .
Non-CR/N on-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion( s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD):Appearance of one or more new lesions  and/or 
unequivocal progre ssion  of existing  non-target lesions. Unequivocal progr ession 
should not nor mally trump ta rget lesion sta tus.  It must  be representative of 
overall dise ase status change, not a single lesion inc rease.
Althoug h a clear progression of “non-target” lesions on ly is exceptiona l, the 
opinion of the treating physician will pr evail in suc h circumst ances, and th e 
progression sta tus w ill be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or 
Principal Investiga tor).
Evaluat ion o f Best Overall R esponse
The best ove rall response is the  best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until dise ase progression/ recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded sin ce the treatment sta rted).  The 
patient's best response assignment will de pend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018The duration of overall CR is me asured from the time measurement criteria are 
first me t for CR until the  first date that progressive disease is obje ctively 
documented.
Duration of stable disease:  Sta ble disease is me asured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression  are met, taking as reference the  
smallest me asurements recorded sin ce the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.
11.6.1 Progression- Free Survival
PFS is defined as the duration of time from sta rt of treatment to time of
progression or death, w hichever occurs first.
11.6.2 Response Review
Patients tha t have a CR or PR b y RECIST 1.1 ma y have the imaging 
studie s doc umenting that response centrally reviewed by the department of 
radiolog y in coordination with the study PI Dr. Margaret von M ehren.   If 
requested, baseline, the initial response image and the confirming scan 
must be forwarded in D ICOM format to the QA Specialist / Study Monitor  
for review.
12.1 Statistical Consid erations
12.2 Study D esign/E ndpoint s
This stu dy’s primary objective is to e stima te the chance of Progression  Free
Survival at 3 months  and te st the hypothe sis tha t it exceeds 5% in angiosarcoma 
patients tr eated with pa zopanib. T he secondary objectives are to estima te the 
response rate (RR) defined as Comple te Response (CR) and Pa rtial Response 
(PR) in angiosarcoma patients tr eated with pazopanib, to  assess ove rall sur vival of 
patients tr eated with pa zopanib a nd to ga ther more safety data for pazopanib in 
this pa tient popula tion. A dditiona lly, Fox Chase Cancer Center, alone; will 
explore the ability of PET with RG D-5 and FD G imaging to assess response.
Using a Simon de sign with n1= 15, n2= 30, w e will submit 15 pa tients initia lly and 
evaluate them for respon se and any time up to 3 months. If at least 1/15  patient 
responds, the n anothe r 15 patients w ill be  recruited. If at least 4/30 pa tients 
respond w e will reject the null of 5% respons e and accept the 20% alternative. 
Otherwise, the study will be termina ted after the initial 15 patients are evaluated 
and the null h ypothe sis accepted. The study has 46% chance of early stopp ing 
unde r the null, 3.5% under the alternative.  It has overall 86% power and 5.8% 
type I error.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018We will test the hypothesis that grade 4 tox icity (despite maximum suppo rtive 
care) is at most  5% versus the alternative that it is a  least 25% .The design will 
have a 54% chance of early stoppin g if the true toxicity is at least 25% and 0.6% 
chance of early stopping in e rror. It will de clare the treatment too tox ic with 82% 
power if the true toxicity is at least 25% . The study will be termina ted early if 
ever 4 of the initia l 15 pa tients ha ve grade 4 or higher toxicity despite maximum 
suppor tive care. Simila rly, if at any point 6 pa tients have grade 4 or higher 
toxicity the study will also be termina ted and declared too  toxic. Properties of the 
stopping rule and final decision r ule are tabulated below.

p(early stop) 6 18 35 54 70 82 91
p(decision) 10 33 61 82 93 98 99
p(early stop): chance that trial is te rmina ted for excess tox icity at or before 15 
patients are evaluated.
p(decision) : chance that treatment is de clared too t oxic either early or at the latest 
after patient 30 ha s been evaluated.
12.2.1 M ethods of data analysis
At compl etion P FS and O S will be estima ted using the method of Kaplan and 
Meier. Patients lost to f ollow  up or follow ed until the end of the study will be 
censored at the time and conditions of their last visit.  Standard estima tes of the 
binomia l proportion w ill be used to e stima te and place confidence bounds o n the 
several response rates.
12.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate
The planned sample size is 30 pa tients. W e estima te the accrual will be complete 
in 2 years, with 1- 2 patients pe r month a cross the multiple sites.
12.4 Analysis  of Secondary Endpo ints
Overall survival, RR  and toxicity data will be collected and summa rized in a 
descriptive fashion.  T he analysis of the imaging c orrelative studi es to be  
performed at FCCC  are outline d in se ction 8.3.3 of the protocol.
12.5 Reporting and Ex clusions
12.4.1 Evaluation of toxicity: All patients w ill be  evaluable for toxicity 
from the time of their first treatment with pa zopanib.
12.4.2 Evaluation of response :  All patients inc luded in the  study must  be 
assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol 
treatment de viations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned

All of the patients who me t the eligibilit y criteria (with the possib le 
exception of  those who received no stud y medication) should be included 
in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response  categories 
4-9 should be conside red to ha ve a treatment failure (disease progression) . 
Thus, a n inc orrect treatment schedule or drug administration doe s not 
result in  exclusion f rom the analysis of the respon se rate.
13.1 Data and Saf ety Monitoring P lan
13.2 Monitoring plan
The QA Specialist / Stu dy Monitor will monitor the medical and stud y records of
each participant accrued at each site throughout th e course of the study.  In 
addition, the QA Specialist / Stu dy Monitor will collect and report data to the

Determination of Creatinine Clearance (ClCR)
Estimation of creatinine  clearan ce using  Cockroft and  Gault method:
ClCR for males (mL/min) = [140 - age (years)] X [weight (kg)]
(72) X [Serum c reatinine  (mg/dL)]
ClCR for females (mL/min) = (0.85) X [140 - age (years)] X [weight (kg)]
(72) X [Serum c reatinine  (mg/dL)]
For SI units:
ClCR for males (mL/min) = [140 - age (years)] X [weight(kg)] X (1.23)

Here, CU is the concentration of creatinine in the urine (mg/dL or µmol/ L, for SI units ), V
is the urine volume (in mL per minute of urine produced dur ing the collection pe riod),
CCR is the serum c reatinine concentration ( mg/dL or µmol/ L, for SI units ), and Cl CR is the

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018APPENDIX C
Urine Protein Creatinine  Ratio (UPC)
Clinic al meaning of UPC
There is a good correlation be tween the ratio of protein concentration to  creatinine 
concentration in a random urine sample and the amount  of protein excreted ove r 24 
hours. Creatinine excretion is  fairly consta nt thr oughout the day regardless of changes in 
urine flow rate.
Men excrete 20 m g to 25 mg of creatinine /kg of body weight/da y. 
Women excrete 15 mg to 20 mg of creatinine /kg of body weight/da y.
Normal protein excretion is <100 mg to 150 m g/24 hour s and is simila r for men and 
women.
Calculating U PC
UPC ratio = Urine protein (mg/dL) / Urine creatinine (mg/dL).
UPC ratio ≈ equiva lent to g rams of protein excreted in ur ine over 24 hrs.
Exam ple: Subject has a urine protein = 90 m g/dL and ur ine creatinine = 30 mg/dL. 
UPC ratio= (90 mg /dL) / (30 mg /dL) = 3
The calculated UPC ratio is 3, w hich correlates to roughly 3 g protein excretion in a 
24-hour period.
Units for UPC ratio
Note: To calculate UPC, pr otein and creatinine concentrations must be expressed in the 
same units  (mg/dL, g/L, or μmol/L ). If, for example , protein concentration is expressed in 
mg/dL and creatinine  concentration is e xpressed in μmol/L , conversion of one of the 
concentration va lues is r equired. Conve rsion factors are:
From To Conversion Factor
Conven tional Units: mg/dL SI Units: μmol/L Multiply by 88.4

Supportive Care Guidelines for Diarrhea, Nausea, and V omiting
These general guidelines are provided to f acilitate subje ct care in the event of diarrhea, 
thereby avoidin g serious complic ations. Guidelines suc h as these should n ever replace 
sound c linical judg ment.  Experience thus f ar suggests that use of monothe rapy 
pazopanib is a ssociated with an inc reased inc idence of diarrhea, primarily of Grade 1 or
2.  In rare cases, dia rrhea can be debilita ting and potentially life threatening, with 
dehydration, r enal insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalances.
Standardized and unive rsal guidelines have been developed by an American Society of 
Clinic al Oncology panel for treating chemothe rapy-induc ed diarrhea [Benson, 2004] .
Early ide ntification and intervention is critical for the optimal manage ment of 
diarrhea.  A subje ct’s baseline bowel patterns should be  establishe d so that changes in 
patterns while on treatment can be identified. An assessment of frequency, consiste ncy, 
and duration of diarrhea, as well as know ledge of other symptoms suc h as fever, 
crampin g, abdomina l pain, na usea, vomiting , dizziness and thir st should be  taken at 
baseline, permitting identification of patients at high risk of diarrhea. Patients w ill be 
educated on si gns and symptoms of diarrhea with instructions to r eport any changes in 
bowel patterns to  the study site physician.
The NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 c riteria for defining dia rrhea are provide d below.
Uncomplic ated dia rrhea is conside red mild to mode rate and is de fined as CTCAE Grade 
1 to 2 w ith no c ompli cating signs or symptoms.
Complic ated dia rrhea is severe and de fined as CT CAE Grade 3 or 4 or Grade 1 or 2 with 
one or more of the following signs or symptoms: se vere crampin g, ≥Grade 2 
nausea/vomiting , decreased performance status, f ever, sepsis, G rade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 
obvious ble eding, dehydration.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Manage ment Guidelines
Uncomplicated dia rrhea of CTCAE Grade 1 or 2:
•Hydration:  have subject drink 8 to 10 la rge glasses (approximately 2 lite rs) of clear 
non-caffeinated liquids a day (e.g., broth o r electrolyte-containing sports drinks) .
•If Grade 2 dia rrhea, consider dose reduction of investigationa l products.
•Dietary modif ications: have subje ct stop a ll lactose-containing products and eat 
frequent, sm all me als
•Pharmacologic intervention using loperamide :
•Begin lope ramide at initia l dose of 4 mg follow ed by 2 mg every 4 hour s or after 
every unformed stool.  The recomme nded ma ximum  daily dose of loperamide is 
16 mg /day.
•Continua tion of loperamide is sugg ested until  diarrhea-free for 12 hou rs.
•If mild to mode rate diarrhea persists for more than 24 hour s, administe r 
loperamide  2 mg every 2 hours and pur sue evaluation for other treatable causes.
•If mild to mode rate diarrhea persists after 48 hour s tota l treatment with 
loperamide , disc ontinue  study drug(s) and consid er initiation of  second-line 
agents (lomotil, oc treotide ).
Complicated diar rhea of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or Grade 1 or 2 with 
complicating f eatures requires aggr essive management:
•Subje ct must c all stud y site physician imme diately in response to any event of 
severe diarrhea with or  without c omplic ations a s listed above .
•Hospita lization ma y be required for subjects most a t risk for life-threatening 
complic ations.
•Interrupt inve stigationa l produc ts until s ymptoms resolve ; conside r 
reintroduc ing at a reduced dose (discuss w ith Novartis Medical 
Monitor or de signee).
•If loperamide has not be en initia ted, be gin lope ramide  usage immediately at an 
initia l dose of 4 mg followed by 2 mg e very 2 hou rs or after every unformed 
stool. T he recomme nded maximum da ily dose of loperamide is 16 m g/day.
•If no impr ovement in se verity after 24-hours of maximal lope ramide dosing , 
subje ct must visit  stud y site and be evaluated:
•For dehydration, use intravenous f luids a s appropriate.
•Antibiotic therapy should be conside red in pa tients, w ho pr esent with si gns and 
symptoms of bacterial diarrhea such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and pr esence of 
fecal leukocytes. Investiga tors should ha ve a low threshold to sta rt such 
treatment in pa tients w ith G rade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018•Before initia tion of antimi crobial therapy, stool c ultures should be obtained.
When bacterial etiology for diarrhea is suspe cted, study-treatment and anti- 
motilit y agents (loperamide or others) should b e held.
•Intervention w ill be  continued until dia rrhea free for 24 hour s.
Alternative Pharmacologic Intervention for Uncomplicated and C omplicated 
Diarrhea
•Lomotil ( dephenoxylate 2.5 mg + atropine 0.025 mg) can be used. The 
recomme nded dos e is 2 t ablets 4 time s daily. When dia rrhea is unde r control, a 
dose reduction w ill be attempted.
•The synthetic octapeptide , octreotide , has been shown to be effective in the 
control of diarrhea induc ed by fluoropyrimidine -based chemothe rapy regimens 
when administ ered as an escalating dose by continuous in fusion or 
subcutaneous inje ction. Octreotide can be administe red at dose s ranging from 
100 µg twice daily to 50 0 µg 3 time s daily, with a maximum- tolerated dose of 
2000 µg 3 time s daily in a 5-day regimen.
Nause a and V omiting
Every attempt w ill be made to control na usea and vomiting  in subje cts who ha ve emesis 
and are unable to retain pazopanib.
Routine pre-medication f or nausea is not ne cessary, but s ymptoma tic subje cts should be  
treated with standard anti-nausea/anti-emetic therapy as necessary.
If a subje ct vomits a fter taking study medication, the subje ct will be instructed not  to take 
a replacement dose  on th at same day. The subje ct will resume taking pazopanib a t the 
next scheduled dose on the follow ing day.  If vomiting persists, the n the  subject should 
contact their physician.
To prevent or treat nausea and vomiting standard medications  are recomm ended. 
Depending upon  approved me dications in your region, th ese may include: 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonist ( granisetron, o ndansetron, dola setron m esylate); NK-1 receptor antagonists  
such as aprepitant,  me toclopramide ,  phe nothia zines (prochlorperazine); corticosteroids, 
(dexamethasones, prednisone); and cannibinoids ( dronabinol) .

Ondanse tron (Zofran) IV: Drug Saf ety Communication - QT prolongation 
AUDIENCE: Oncology, Surgery, Gastroenterology
ISSU E: The U.S. Food a nd D rug Administr ation ( FDA) is informing healthcare 
professiona ls and the public that prelimina ry results from a recently comple ted clinical 
study suggest tha t a 32 m g single intravenous dose of onda nsetron (Zofran, onda nsetron 
hydrochloride, and generics) may affect the electrical activity of the heart (QT interval

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018prolongation), which could pre-dispose patients to develop an abnormal and pot entially 
fatal heart rhythm know n as Torsades de Point es.
There were changes to the  Zofran drug label to remove the 32 mg  single intravenous 
dose. The upda ted label will state that onda nsetron can continue to be used in adults  and 
children with chemothe rapy-induc ed nausea and vomiting at the lo wer intravenous  dose 
recomme nded in the drug label, a dose of 0.15 m g/kg administe red every 4 hou rs for 
three doses; how ever, no sing le intravenous dose should  exceed 16 m g. Information from 
the new clinical study will be included in the upda ted drug label.
BACKGROUND: Zofran (onda nsetron) is in a class of medications c alled 5-HT3 
receptor antagonists.  It is used to pr event na usea and vomiting caused by cancer 
chemothe rapy, radiation therapy and su rgery. FDA will evaluate the final study results 
when available, and w ill work with Novartis to explore an alternative single dose 
regimen tha t is both sa fe and effective for the prevention o f chemothe rapy-induc ed 
nausea and vomiting in adults.
RECOMMENDATION: The new information on QT prolonga tion doe s not change any 
of the recomme nded oral dosing regimens for ondansetron.  It also doe s not  change the 
recomme nded low er dose intravenous dosi ng of ondansetron to pr event post- operative 
nausea and vomitin g.
•The use of a single 32 m g intravenous dose of ondansetron should be  avoided.
New information indic ates that QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent 
manner, and sp ecifically at a single intravenous  dose of 32 m g.
•Patients w ho ma y be at particular risk for QT prolongation w ith onda nsentron are 
those with conge nital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, 
bradyarrhythmias, or patients ta king concomita nt me dications tha t prolong the QT 
interval
•Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypoka lemia or hypoma gnesemia) should b e 
corrected prior to the  infusion  of onda nsetron.
•The lower dose intravenous regimen of 0.15 m g/kg every 4 hour s for three doses 
may be used in a dults  with chemothe rapy-induc ed nausea and vomitin g. 
However, no sing le intravenous dose of onda nsetron should e xceed 16 mg  due to 
the risk of QT prolongation.
•The new information doe s not c hange any of the recomme nded oral dosing 
regimens for ondansetron, including the single oral dose of 24 mg  for 
chemothe rapy induced nausea and vomitin g.

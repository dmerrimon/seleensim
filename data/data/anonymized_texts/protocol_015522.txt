 1 Background / Scientific Rationale  
1.1 Introduction  
Musculoskeletal injuries are a significant public health concern globally, contributing a large 
burden of disability and suffering. [1] Progenitor/stem cell therapies have shown great 
potential for addressing acute, traumatic and chronic orthopedic injury. [2] Orthopedic 
surgeons have started  to augment surgical procedures and treat degenerative conditions such 
as osteoarthritis, with injections of bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and platelet rich plasma 
(PRP). [3-7] Several clinical application studies have concluded that the success  of the 
intervention  is dependent upon the number of progenitor cells harvested and utilized. While 
bone marrow aspiration is frequently utilized for orthopedic applications, the number of cells 
harvested is variable and dependent on several factors including individual, aspi ration 
technique and location of harvest. The most efficient method involves rapid, small -volume, 
and multiple aspirations from multiple locations on the iliac crest. [8, 9] In addition, bone 
marrow aspiration is an invasive procedure requiring more clinical resources and logistics 
demands . [10] As a result, o rthopedic studies have begun to investigate different methods and 
locations for progenitor cells for orthopedic purposes including injury effusion fluids and 
arthroscopic by products [11], adipose tissues [12], synovial fluid [13, 14], subacromial 
bursal cells [15], and mobilized peripheral blood cells. [7, 16, 17]  
Bone marrow (BM) contains a variety of stem/progenitor cells, including hematopoietic 
progenitor cells (HPCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and mesenchymal progenitor 
cells (MPCs) . [18] CD34 is a common  membrane marker  for HPCs and  studies have shown 
very low level of circulating CD34+ cells (10 -100 CD34+ cells/ml) in PB under 
physiological steady -state conditions [19-21]. A mobilization regime is needed to effectively 
shift progenitor cells from BM niche to PB. Various interleukins, the chemokines, or the 
hematopoietic growth factors have shown to increase mobilization of progenitor cells with 
various efficiencies and kinetics. [22, 23]  In this study, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim will be 
used as HPCs mobilizing agents.  
1.1.1.  Background on Filgrastim and Pegfilgrastim  and the Use of Biosimilars  
Filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF)  protein  with a molecular 
weight of approximately 19 kilodaltons (kD) and consists of 175 amino acids. Filgrastim is 
obtained from the bacterial fermentation of a strain of E. coli.  transformed with a genetically 
engineered plasmid containing the human G -CSF gene. Pegfilgrastim Fulphila®  is a long -
acting covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human  filgrastim, and 
monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG). To produce pegfilgrastim, a 20 kD PEG  molecule is 
covalently bound to the N -terminal methionyl residue of filg rastim.  The average molecular 
weight of pegfilgrastim is approximately 39 kD. Attachment of PEG increases the size of 
filgrastim as a result it  becomes too large for renal clearance. Consequently, neutrophil -

 mediated clearance predominates in elimination of the drug. A single injection of pegfilgrastim 
produces increased serum concentrations to 42 hours, compared with between 3.5 and 3.8 hours 
for multiday administration of filgrastim [24, 25].  
Granix® (tbo -filgrastim), an FDA -approved biosimilar of filgrastim , will be used for the 
filgrastim mobilization (see appendix A). Fulphila® (pegfilgrastim -jmdb), an FDA -approved 
biosimilar of pegfilgrastim , will be used for the pegfilgrastim mobilization (see appendix B). 
Biosimilars are biological products that have no clinically meaningful differences from a 
reference product [26]. Biosimilars are approved by the FDA after rigorous evaluation and 
testing by the applicant [26]. The above biosimilars were selected by the study investigator and 
a consulting board -certified oncologist  based on the similarity of indication, risk/benefit ratio, 
previous clinical testing, and general availability.  
1.1.2 Indication , Dosage  and Safety  of Filgrastim  and Pegfilgrastim  
Filgrastim and Pegfilgrastim  are indicated to increase survival in patients acutely exposed to 
myelosuppressive doses of radiation and to decrease the incidence of infection in patients with 
non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti -cancer drugs associated with a 
clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.  
Previous work has determined that the optimal dosage of filgrastim for cell mobilization is 10 
mcg/kg/day for four or more consecutive days which is inconvenient for the patients [27].  
According to the FDA label,  patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell 
collection and therapy 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection  of filgrastim  is administer ed for 
at least 4 days before first leukapheresis procedur e. For pegfilgrastim according to the FDA  
label , 6 mg  of pegfilgrastim is  administered subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle  to 
patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The above suggested dosage 
will be used in the study. Pegfilgr astim may be preferred over  filgrastim, due to its convenient 
once -per-cycle subcutaneous administration as compared to daily administration of filgrastim  
for at least 4 days.  
Several clinical studies have shown filgrastim and pegfilgrastim  to be safe and effective for 
mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells in patients  and healthy donor . [28-31] Both the 
pharmaceutical agents increase the production of progenitor cells in the bone marrow leading 
to increased release and circulation of progenitor cells in the peripheral blood [24, 32, 33]. The 
long-term safety of filgrastim mobilization has been reported with bone pain as a common 
adverse effect and no association with neoplastic risks identified. [27, 34-37] In one study 
involving 126 cancer patients, 44% reported mild -to-moderate muscle and bone pain and 7% 
reported headaches. [33] The Spanish National Donor Registry reports that out of 736 donors, 
90% reported bone pain and 33% had headaches. [34]  In preclinical and clinical studies, 
pegfilgrastim has been shown to have comparable efficacy and safety profile to filgrastim  with 
pegfilgrastim only requiring one injection to achieve the same effect as multiple day  injections 
of filgrastim. [24, 38-42] Pegfilgrastim is comparable to filgrastim for mobilization of

 peripheral blood progenitor cells as shown by CD34+ (marker for hemopoietic stem cells) cells. 
[43, 44] A single dose of pegfilgrastim was able to mobilize a sufficient number of CD34+ in a 
multiple myeloma patient not responsive to two previous attempts with high or standard dose 
chemotherapy followed by filgrastim. [45]   
1.2 Rationale for the study  
Mainly the previous study of mobilization of progenitor cells to PB is focused on hematologic 
oncologic clinical practice of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Pharmaceutical mobilization 
by filgrastim, followed by peripheral harvest of cells with apheresis is used more commonly 
than bone marrow aspirate for the hematologic oncologic c linical practice of hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant [46].  These previous studies have evaluated the potential of filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim to improve apheresis harvest. However, combining pegfilgrastim mobilization 
with peripheral blood harvest and concentration with a PRP device has not been fully evaluate d. 
The PI recently completed a study on developing M-PRP product created by peripheral blood 
mobilization  of progenitor cells  with filgrastim  and processing with Arthrex Angel system  and 
compa ring it with concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA).  The most significant finding 
of this study was that  the M -PRP product  contained a higher concentration of platelets and 
monocytes when compared to cBMA. As expected, M-PRP had significantly greater WBC, 
monocytes, and HPCs compared to PRP alone. This study found overall a  similar cellular 
product with an easier harvest with M -PRP when compared to cBMA  [47].  
The multiday administration of filgrastim is inconvenient  for the patients ; therefore, the PI in 
this study aim s to utilize pegfilgrastim as a mobilizing agent for creating M -PRP product  in 
one subcutaneous administration . In this study the M -PRP product created by either 
pegfilgrastim or filgrastim  will be evaluated in vitro  or bench top . The PI hypothesize s that 
both of the pharmaceutical mobilization agents  would result in similar M -PRP product. It is 
proposed that the progenitor cells isolated in M -PRP would be of similar property to cultured 
bone marrow derived cells  (when cultured in hypoxia) , with established multi -potentiality and 
differentiation potential to the mesodermal lineage. Previous studies have shown that 
circulating cells in PB are multipotent and possess differentiation potential. [16, 48, 49] Due to 
convenience, p egfilgra stim is a more  practical mobilizing agent ; thus, could be preferred in 
creating potent point of care M-PRP product for application in orthopedic  medicine.  
In this study, in conjunction with the mobilizing agen t, the M -PRP processing requires  a 
concentrating PRP system , Arthrex Angel system .  The Arthrex Angel system uses 
centrifugation and optics to more precisely separate cell types using buffy coat method. All 
cells have a density range and non -uniformly after centrifugation. Arthrex Angel system has 
the unique ability to isolate specific c ells using inherent properties of cells that absorb differing 
wavelengths of light. The settings on the system can be c ontrolled to adjust the proportion of 
cells versus plasma. Increasing the setting from 7% to 15%, the Angel system isolates more 
cells from a deeper portion of the buffy coat, which results in capturing more HPCs per volume.

harvested after peripheral mobilization of progenitor cells using filgrastim versus pegfilgrastim.

 Also, the volume of the cPRP can be increased with autologous PPP, which consists of growth 
factors and other beneficial proteins . The Arthrex Angel system combined with peripheral 
mobilization could be used as point of care  method for creating effective M -PRP product.

2 Protocol Design  
The proposed study is a prospective, randomized controlled , single -center  laboratory study 
involving 10 healthy volunteers . Once the potential participant has cleared the screening, consent ed 
to the study  procedures,  completed the medical interview , and laboratory blood testing, the subject 
will undergo two serial mobilization events .  The scheduling of the mobilization events will be 
varied across the 10 participants to counter sequencing effects of the mobilization events. 5 heathy 
donors will be administered standard filgrastim mobilization regimen of 10 mcg/kg per day for 4 
days will be followed by a  standard pegfilgrastim mobilization regimen consisting of one 6 mg 
injection  separated by 8 weeks  for 5 of the participants . The other 5 healthy donors will re ceive the 
reverse order  of the  pharmaceutical agent, first pegfilgrastim followed by filgrastim . 
On the first day of the study, a first blood draw of 130 mL will be performed which will be used to 
create standard PRP  for laboratory testing  and subjects will begin a filgrastim  or pegfilgrastim  
dosage series . After the specified time (4 days for filgrastim and 7 days for pegfilgrastim), a second 
130 mL of blood will be harvested  and processed with the Arthrex Angel system to create M -PRP 
for laboratory testing .  The standard PRP and M -PRP cellular content will be studied and quantified  
in vitro  with cell counting , cell cultur ing and protein analysis . 8 weeks after  the second blood 
harvest, the subjects  will return for a third 130 mL  of blood draw, followed by administration of a  
second mobilizing agent ( pegfilgrastim  or filgrastim) . After the specified time (4 days for filgrastim 
and 7 days for pegfilgrastim), the patients will return for a fourth blood draw of 130mL. The sample 
will be processed with the Arthre x Angel system to create M -PRP for laboratory testing . The 
cellular content of the M-PRP product will be studied and quantified in vitro  with cell counting , 
cell cultur ing and protein analysis .  Thereafter, the cellular content of M-PRP product will be 
compared between filgrastim and pegfilgrastim mobilization agents.    
3 Objectives  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The objective of this study is to compare and  quantify the cellular content ( in vitro ) of the mobilized 
M-PRP products harvested after  a standard four -day filgrastim mobilization regimen versus  one-
day pegfilgrastim regimen  when combined with Arthrex Angel System . This study would be useful 
to further develop optimized point of care orthopedic product  in future .  
 3.2 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The Automated hematological analysis will be performed on all M-PRP products to quantify total 
red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), monocyte, platelet, and hematopoietic progenitor

 cell (HPC) concentration. The cell count of the M -PRP products will be performed  and cells will 
be cultured and characterized under different differentiation conditions. The protein analysis of 
the M -PRP will be carried out  via ELISA and/or flow cytometry.  
 
4. Hypotheses  
 4.1Null Hypothesis:   
H0-Particpants will have not a similar cellular content ( in vitro ) of the mobilized M -PRP 
products harvested after  a standard when comparing a 4-day filgrastim mobilizing treatment  
to a one-day pegfilgrastim mobilizing treatment.  
 4.2 Alternative Hypothesis:   
H1- Participants will have  a similar  cellular content ( in vitro ) of the mobilized M -PRP products 
harvested after  a standard when comparing a 4 -day filgrastim mobilizing treatment to a 
one-day pegfilgrastim mobilizing treatment.  
5  Treatment Plan  
5.1 Participant Eligibility  
The proposed study is a controlled laboratory study involving 10 healthy  male  volunteers  
between the ages of 19 and 39 years  with weight 50 -100 kg .  The age was limited because the 
cellular components of PRP have been found to be dependent on these variables. [50, 51]  The 
weight was restricted due to the logistics of pre -filled syringes and the cost of Filgrastim. Female 
volunteers will be excluded to avoid the potential of any fetal risks from administration of 
filgrastim  during pregnancy. The general exclusion criteria were based on associated risk factors 
with mobilizing agents. S ubjects will be selected using the following inclusion and exclusion  
criteria:  
5.2 Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Healthy Male 19-39 of age  and weight 50 -100 kg  
2. Subject  consent s to coming 5 serial days for filgrastim  treatment  and additional blood 
draw and then 8 weeks later two addition visits for pegfilgrastim  treatment and 7 days 
later blood draws.  The above order of administration will be provided to 5 participants 
and the additional 5 will receive pegfilgrastim treatment first followed by filgrastim to 
counter sequencing effects.

6 Participant Enrollment  
10 healthy male participants  will be recruited through the Andrews Institute physician practices  via word 
of mouth and utilizing a recruitment flyer ( see appendix F) at the Andrews Institute campus . Potential 
participants will be prescreened for inclusion and exclusion criteria through standard of care medical 
evaluations. Participants  meeting the inclusion criteria will have the study explained to them by one of the 
members of the investigating team, and they will be given an opportunity to participate if they are 
interested. Once a potential participant has agreed to be involved in the study, they will go through the 
described informed consent process.  
 6.1 Screening Process:  
Once interested participants are identified  and prescreened,  a screening visit will be scheduled. 
During the initial visit,  a screening form will be completed and reviewed. If an individual answers 
"yes" to any of the initial screening exclusion questions, they will be informed that they do not 
qualify, and they will be informed that they can keep their screening form. If all answers are "no" 
then the  form will be placed in the study documents . 
Once the screening requirements are met, the informed consent will be provided  to ensure the 
volunteer understands the details of the study including the benefits and risk factors. The subject 
will be provided sufficient time to consent and sign the informed consent form (ICF). The 
principal investigator (PI) will be available to answer an y questions or provide clarifications  
during the informed consent process .  After the volunteer has consented to participate in the 
study, a medical interview,  and a blood  test will be administered (CBC , CMP ) will be conducted.  
The medical interview will include a complete physical examination and review of the blood test 
to ensure that no exclusion conditions exist.  Physical examination will include height/weight, 
head/neck, cardiovascular, lung, and abdominal examinations. Standard vitals will be taken.

In adherence to the 21 CFR 50, Protection of Human Subjects Guidelines, the informed consent 
process will be performed by one of the study investigators or staff, in the research office  that has 
received training on the informed consent process . No aspects of the study will be conducted 
prior to obtaining informed consent from each participant.  The purpose and methods of the study 
along with the expected effects will be reviewed with each potential participant. Each participant 
will be provided  a copy of t he consent and sufficient time will be given for the opportunity to 
read and ask any questions about the study.  After signing of the informed consent document, 
participants will be given a copy for their records.  
The designee will review with each participant that they are free to refuse to the study or to 
withdraw from it at any time.  
6.3 Consent Withdrawal:  
During the informed consent procedure, participants will be informed that if at any point during 
the study , consent may be withdrawn. To withdraw consent , participants can request in writing to 
withdraw HIPAA authorization and the research site will not use or provide any health 
information to researchers. At this time, the link between the participant’s health information will 
be severed with the research team. This process for consent withdrawal will be reviewed with 
each participant and identified barrie rs will be addressed  at the time of informed consent .  
6.4 Benefits:  
There is no direct benefit to participants participating in this study. This study may help direct 
clinical practice in alternative method  to extract stem cells that can be used to augment surgical 
procedures.  
6.5 Compensation:  
Compensation  will be provided  to participants  on a pre-set schedule.  A $50.00  dollar  stipend  
will be provided  to participants  on the first day of receiving  the mobilization  agents.  Each  
subsequent  scheduled  study  treatment  visit will award  the participant  a $75.00  stipend  until  
the total  of $500.00  is met.

components total cell count, cell growth and protein (chemokine/cytokine) analysis. After the 
blood draw, the volunteers will undergo 1 injection of pegfilgrastim.  The 6mg dose  will be 
administered to the volunteers subcutaneously into the thigh . Appendix B, a pegfilgrastim  
information handout will be given after pegfilgrastim  administration.    
One week after the pegfilgrastim administration, another 130 mL blood draw  will occur  by a 
standard venipuncture  on the left or right upper extremity . The blood will be processed with the 
Arthrex Angel system  to generate M -PRP.  The M-PRP samples will be analyzed for cellular 
components total cell count, cell growth and protein (chemokine/cytokine) analysis.  The safety 
of the volunteer will be followed up via a phone call at 7 day and 28 days after mobilized blood 
collection.

 8.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in the human subject, 
including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s 
participation in  the research, whether  considered related to the subject’s participation in the 
research.  
8.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Serious adheres events are any events that:  
• Result in death  
• Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk o f death from the event as it 
occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospitalization  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condition which investigators just to represent significant hazards  
8.3 Unanticipated Problem (UP):  
Defined by DHHS 45 CFR part 46 as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets the 
following criteria.  
• unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the stu dy 
population.   
• related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, 
possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research);  
• suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
8.4 AE & SAE Collection and Reporting  
Throughout the study the research team will monitor the occurrence of AE and SAE. 
Data will be collected if an instance occurs,  and the PI  will be notified. All AE data, such 
as onset date, resolution date, outcome and treatments given will be documented in the 
source documents and will be recorded in the EDC and analyzed for severity to follow 
reporting protocol if severity level.  
Follow -up will occur using the provided safety monitoring form if AE occur s. The follow 
up will end either w hen the symptoms resolve or up to 30 days pas t the end of the study 
participation.

 8.5 Risks  and Discomforts:  
 As with any research involving participants , there is the inherent risk of a breach in 
patient confidentiality though this will be minimized using  participant  code numbers and 
adherence to all HIPAA guidelines. Standard sterile precautions will be utilized for the 
administration of filgrastim  and pegfilgrastim , but with any procedure  there is risk of 
infection, bleeding, and swelling.  
Filgrastim  is administered subcutaneously via a single prefilled syringe for manual use or 
for use with the On -body Injector for filgrastim  which is co -packaged with a single 
prefilled syringe . 
 
Anticipated Discomforts of Filgrastim  
Aching in the bones and muscles  
 
Possible Serious A dverse Events (SAE) of Filgrastim  
Splenic rupture  
Serious lung problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  
Serious allergic reaction  
Sickle cell crises  
Kidney injury (glomerulonephritis).  
Capillary leak syndrome.  
 
Additional response to these a dverse events can be found in Appendix B.

 Splenic rupture.  
Serious lung problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  
Serious allergic reaction.  
Glomerulonephritis  
Leukocytosis  
Thrombocytopenia  
Aortitis   
Capillary leak syndrome.  
 
Contraindications to the use of Filgrastim  and pegfilgrastim  include patients with a history of 
serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony -stimulating factors such as Filgrastim or 
Pegfilgrastim. Most common adverse reactions in patients undergoing peripheral blood progenitor 
cell mobilization and colle ction (≥ 5% incidence) are bone pain, pyrexia (fever) and headache. 
Although extremely rare, cases of splenic rupture, acute respiratory distress syndrome, serious 
allergic reactions, fatal sickle  cell crisis, capillary leak syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, and 
glomerulonephritis have been reported in patients undergoing treatment with Filgrastim  and 
pegfilgrastim . For this reason, patients will be monitored with a review of symptoms and a 
physical examination upon each visit, including ascertaining blood pressure and pulse, as well as a 
lung, heart, and abdomen examination.   
The approximate duration of the study will be a 10 week period. During this 10 week period a total 
of four blood draws will occur with the amount of 130 mLs each draw  with a total amount of 520 
mL of blood drawn . To review the safety of this practice , a comparison between the acceptable 
blood donation practice was reviewed. For whole blood donation, one pint (~473.16  mL) of blood 
is drawn in one sitting with the acceptable inter -response time of 56 days. During the duration of 
this entire study , a total of 520 mL of blood will be drawn over the 10 week duration, lowering the 
risk of the blood draws significantly  less than the risks with blood draw regimes.  
8.6 Safety Monitoring Plan:    
To ensure close monitoring and support of the participants due to the use of filgrastim, a safety and 
data monitoring plan will be implemented.  The participant safety monitoring plan will include  
follow up via a phone call at 7 day and 28 days after mobilized blood collection.  At this time, 
patients will be asked an open -ended question by the research team: “How has your general health 
been and did you find the study uncomfortable ?” Responses will be summarized in Appendix C 
A single center, prospective study to compare the quality and quantity of the cellular content of M -PRP 
harvested after peripheral mobilization of progenitor cells using filgrastim versus pegfilgrastim.

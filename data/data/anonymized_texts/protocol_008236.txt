Methodology:  
 
This is a Phase  I/II study  of KW-0761  in patients  with advanced  and/or metastatic  solid 
organ  malignancies.  Phase  I of the study  will be an open  label, non -randomized,  dose  
escalation,  and safety study  in adults  with histologically  confirmed  advanced  and/or  
metastatic  solid tumor  malignancies.  Subjects  who sign an Informed  Consent form  and 
who meet the eligibility  criteria  will be enrolled  to receive  a weekly  intravenous  (IV) dose  of 
KW-0761  ranging  from 0.5 mg/kg  to 10.0 mg/kg  as feasible  starting  on Day 1 for 4 weeks  
(cycle  1) and a dose  every 2 weeks  for 4 weeks  starting  on day 29 (cycle 2).  The initial  
treatment  course  will include  Cycle  1 + Cycle  2. Subsequent treatment courses  are 
permissible  for subjects  demonstrating  a response  or maintaining  stable  disease  and will 
consist  of an infusion  of KW-0761 every other  week. In the absence  of toxicity  or 
progression  of disease,  patients  may stay on study  for up to 12 months. If a subject  
discontinues  from the study for reasons  other than  DLT prior to receiving  four complete  
infusions  (Week  4), the subject will be replaced.

Standard  3+3 cohorts  for safety  and DLT detection  will be utilized.  Each  cohort  will consist  
of at least three  evaluable  subjects. If  DLT is observed  in 0/3 subjects,  escalation  to the 
next dose  level will occur. If  DLT is detected  in 1 of 3 subjects, then  three  more  subjects  
will be added  at that dose  level.  If DLT is demonstrated  in an additional subject,  dose  
escalation  will cease. The  dose will depend  on the cohort  in which  they have  been  
enrolled.  Subjects  will be assigned  sequentially  to a cohort in  the order screening  is 
completed.  No effort  will be made  to stratify  types  of subjects  into a particular  cohort (e.g.,  
reserve  more  severe  subjects  or tumor  distribution  patterns  for the higher  doses).   Cohorts  
will be dosed  consecutively  by ascending  dose  amount starting  with the lowest  dose  and 
not in parallel.Telephonic  assessments  or medical record  reviews  will occur  at Months  6,

 12, 18, and 24 after last dose  is administered. The  Investigator  can elect to  conduct  
additional tests  and/or  follow -up visits  in clinic  during  this period  as needed  to evaluate  
and/or treat any  adverse  event  (AEs).  
 
Part 2 of the study  (Phase  II) will enroll  a total of 48 subjects,  16 patients  in 3 tumor - 
specific  expansion  cohorts  each  treated  with the MTD  (or highest  dose  tested)  as 
determined  in the Phase  I part of the study. The 3  tumor -specific  expansion  cohorts  will 
include  non-small  cell lung cancer, gastric  adenocarcinoma,  and triple -negative  breast  
carcinoma  (negative for immunohistochemical expression  of the estrogen  receptor,  
progesterone  receptor,  and the Her2  protein).  
 
Number  of subjects:  
 
Enrollment  of up to 72  subjects  is planned. Of  the 72 subjects,  a maximum of 24 will be 
enrolled  in the dose  escalation  part of this study  and the remaining  48 will be enrolled  to 3 
tumor -specific  expansion  cohorts. Depending  on the dose  escalation  cohort, 2 to 5 
additional subjects  may be added  to a cohort in  whom  a dose limiting  toxicity  has been  
observed  to confirm results  (Toxicity  Definitions  and Stopping  Rules; Section  9.5). 
 
Cohort  dose  schedule:  
 
In the dose  escalation  portion, the starting  dose  will be 0.5  mg/kg  administered  i.v.once  
every  week  for four weeks  and then once  every 2 weeks  for 4 weeks. Succeeding  dose  
levels  will be 1,  3, and 10 mg/kg  as feasible.  
 
Standard  3+3 cohorts  for safety  and DLT detection  will be utilized.  Each  cohort  will consist  
of at least three  subjects. Patients in  each  cohort must  complete the first 4 weeks  of study  
therapy  prior to enrollment  of subsequent cohorts. If  DLT is observed  in 0/3 subjects,  
escalation  to the next dose  level will occur. If  DLT detected  in 1 of 3 subjects, then  three  
more  subjects will be added  at that dose  level.  If DLT  is demonstrated  in an additional  
subject, dose  escalation  will cease.  Cohorts  of 3 to 6 subjects  will be treated  until either  
DLT, or maximal dose  level is achieved.  If a subject  discontinues  from the study  for 
reasons  other than  DLT prior to receiving  four complete  infusions  (Week  4), the subject  
will be replaced.

Definition  of Treatment Course  
 
In the first treatment  course,  KW-0761  will be administered  i.v. once  a week for four weeks  
(Cycle  1) and subsequently  every 2 weeks  for 4 weeks  (Cycle  2). Subsequent treatment  
courses  are permissible  for subjects  demonstrating  a response  or maintaining  stable  
disease  and will consist of an infusion  of KW-0761  every other  week. Each  subsequent  
course  (treatment  course  2, treatment course  3, etc.) will be defined as  completion  of two 
additional infusions  of KW-0761  over 4 weeks. In the absence  of progression  or toxicity  
subjects  may continue  treatment  up to one year. If  a subject experiences  an overall  CR, 
the subject may continue  on study  for up to an additional  four infusions  beyond  CR, then 
discontinue  treatment  in order  to determine  duration  of response. If  a subject  experiences  
a PR  or SD, the subject  may continue  therapy  after consultation  between  the investigator  
and the Principal  Investigator until  disease  progression  occurs  or other withdrawal criteria  
are met (refer to Section  4.8, Criteria for Study  Termination).  
 
Definition  of Maximum  Tolerated  Dose  (MTD)  
 
The MTD  is defined  as the dose  below  that dose  at which  at least 2 of up to 6 subjects  in a 
dosing  cohort  experience  DLT. The MTD  will be determined  during  the first part of this trial. 
 
Definition  of Phase  II Dose  
 
The Phase  II dose  will be the  MTD  as determined  in the  Phase  I part of the trial. If three  
evaluable  subjects  do not experience  a DLT in the 10 mg/kg  dosing  cohort then  the Phase  
II dose  will be 10 mg/kg.  
Dose -Limiting  Toxicity  
 
A dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  is any toxicity  that does  not have  a clear -cut alternative  
explanation.  Any of the following,  specified  below,  will be considered  a DLT:  
 
A DLT will be defined  as any > Grade  3 non-hematologic or hematologic  toxicity  that is 
related  to treatment  . The following  are exceptions  to the definition  and will be considered  
a DLT if: 
 
• Grade  4 neutropenia  > 7 days  
 
• Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  
 
• Grade  3 thrombocytopenia  associated  with clinically  significant bleeding  
 
Dose  Escalation  
 
The dose  for the first cohort  will be 0.5  mg/kg. In the absence  of a DLT, dose  will be 
escalated  in the following  increments,  1, 3, and 10 mg/kg  as feasible.  Dose  escalation will 
cease  when  at least one of the following  endpoints  is reached:

Page  8 of 63  
 • The MTD  is exceeded; OR  
 
• A cohort  of at least 3 subjects  has been  dosed  with 10 mg/kg  KW-0761  
 
Dose  escalation  will be based  on three  subjects  receiving  four complete  infusions  of KW- 
0761.  
Replacement of Subjects  
 
During  Phase  1, subjects  who do not complete  the first four infusions  for reasons  other  
than a DLT will be replaced.  
 
Phase  II 
 
After determination  of the recommended  dosing  level,  additional subjects  with gastric  
adenocarcinoma,  non-small  cell lung carcinoma, and  triple -negative  breast  carcinoma  will 
then be enrolled  and treated  at that dose.  A maximum of 48 subjects,  16 of each  
carcinoma  type are to be treated  with the dose  determined  from the initial  portion  of the 
study.  A total of 15 subjects, including  those  receiving  the dose  determined from Phase  1, 
will be treated  initially.  
 
Criteria  for Evaluation:  
 
• Safety:  The safety  of KW-0761  will be determined  by reported  AEs, changes  in 
physical examinations,  vital sign  measurements,  ECGs  and laboratory  analyses.   
Safety  evaluations  will be performed  throughout the  study. All  AEs and serious  AEs  
will be graded  according  to the National Cancer Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  
for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Scale,  Version  4.03. A dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT) is  
defined  as any Grade  3 or higher infusion  reaction  or any Grade  3 or 4 toxicity,  unless  
the AE is clearly  and incontrovertibly  due to extraneous  causes.  
• Pharmacodynamics:  A detailed  assessment of the biologic  activity of KW-0761  will 
be completed  on all subjects  enrolled  into this  study.  This will include  acquisition  of 
serial  serum, peripheral  blood  mononuclear cells, stool  samples,  and tumor  tissue  to 
evaluate  the immunoregulatory  activity  of this agent.  
 
• Efficacy:  Efficacy  evaluations  will be based  on response  to treatment (PR or better),  
time to PD  and duration  of overall  response.  Changes  in tumor measurements  and 
tumor responses  will be assessed  by the investigator using  RECIST  1.1 and irRC . 
 
Statistical Methods  
 
Categorical variables  will be summarized  using  counts  and percentages,  while  continuous  
variables  will be summarized  using  the mean, median,  standard  deviation,  minimum,  
maximum,  and number  of observations.  Any statistical testing  will be two tailed  at the 5% 
significance  level.  The frequency  of AEs will be tabulated.  Baseline, end -of-study,  and 
change  from baseline  for clinical l aboratories, vital signs, and ECG data  will be 
summarized.  Descriptive  statistics  will be computed  for safety parameters  as appropriate.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
A large  body  of research  suggests  that the 
immune  system aids  in controlling  the 
development  of cancer  in normal animals  by 
ongoing  immune  surveillance1. Once  
developed,  the tumor microenvironment  
becomes a site  of immune  privilege  as 
tumor -specific  tolerance  has been  identified  
in the absence  of generalized  
immunosuppression2,3. As such,  immune  
evasion,  resulting  from both passive  and 
active  tolerizing  forces  that inhibit  antitumor  
immunity,  is a hallmark  of cancer  4. Passive  
mechanisms  include  immunoediting, which  results  in selection  for low antigenicity.  Active  
means of tolerization  include  direct suppression  of effector  T cells5. Regulatory  T cells 
(Treg) are a subset of CD4+  T cells that are requisite  for control of autoimmunity,  
dampening  excessive  inflammation  caused  by the immune  response  to pathogens,  and 
maintaining maternal -fetal tolerance6-8. While  Treg cells are critical  for maintaining  
peripheral  tolerance, their  potent  immunoregulatory properties  can promote  the 
development  and progression  of numerous  types  
of malignancies by inhibiting  effector  
responses9,10. Treg cell recognition  of self- 
antigens is  in part responsible  for their ability  to Figure 1.  Ablation  of Treg cells affects  the growth  
of fully established  primary  tumors . 
maintain  immune  homeostasis. As  most tumor  associated  antigens  are modified  or 
aberrantly expressed  self antigens,  Treg are considered  to be active  participants  in tumor

 specific  immune  privilege11. This is particularly  exemplified  in the observed  regression  of 
established tumors  in experimental  models  of Treg cell  depletio n.12-14 
Treg cells exert  their suppressive  function  through  a number of different mechanisms10. 
CD25,  a subunit  of the IL-2 receptor  and the original  Treg cell surface  marker, is  
constitutively  and highly  expressed  on Treg cells but  also upregulated  on effector  T cells15. 
The high level of expression  on Treg cells could  deprive  effector  T cells of IL-2 and inhibit  
their proliferation16. CTLA -4 is well known  in limiting  responses  of activated  T cells and is 
also implicated  in Treg cell−mediated  suppression17. Treg cells can also inhibit  the function  
of dendritic  cells. LAG -3, a CD4 homologue  that exhibits  high binding  affinity  with MHC  
class II  is thought to be  required  for maximal suppressive action  of Treg cells18. Binding  of 
major  histocompatibility  complex  (MHC)  molecules  by LAG-3 on immature  dendritic  cells 
(DCs) may lead to inhibition  of maturation  and decreased  costimulatory  capacity19. Treg 
cells can produce  several  suppressive  proteins  including  IL-10, IL -35, granzyme  B, IL-9, 
and TGF-β20. Treg  cells are capable  of killing  effector  T cells and antigen  presenting  cells 
(APC)21,22. In a model of infection,  Treg cells have  also been shown  through their influence  
on DCs to play a critical role  in the homeostasis  of CD8+ T cell priming  by regulating  the 
expansion and  avidity  of effectors23. 
Treg cells were  originally  characterized  as CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes  and subsequently  
found  to specifically express  the forkhead/winged  helix family  transcription  factor  
Foxp3.24,25 Treg cell differentiation and function  are dependent on  the expression of  the 
lineage -specifying transcription  factor  Foxp326. Furthermore, the entire  range  of Treg cell 
functions  depends  on a Foxp3 -dependent  hierarchical  transcriptional  program27-29. Mice  
with a loss-of-function  mutation  in Foxp3  lack functional  Treg cells and develop  lethal  
autoimmunity  and lymphoproliferative  disease  at an early  age28. Similarly  humans  
harboring  mutations  in FOXP3  suffer from  immune  dysregulation,  polyendocrinopathy,  
enteropathy,  X-linked  syndrome  (IPEX)30. Expression  of Foxp3  drives  Treg cell 
differentiation  in the thymus, but they  can also be induced  in the periphery  through  
mechanisms  that involve  TGF  and IL2 31. Accumulating  evidence  demonstrates  that Treg 
cells utilize  components of the specific  immune  response  in which  they are acting, to  
suppress  it. For example,  expression  of the transcription  factor Irf4  is required  for Treg 
cells to be  able to suppress  TH2 responses,  and Irf4 controls  a module  of the Foxp3  
program that contains  20% of its targets32. Similarly,  CXCR3, a target  of Tbet,  is required  
for control of TH1 responses33, and Stat3  for TH17  responses10. These  observations  
suggest that Treg  cells integrate  external  local cues  to modulate  specific  segments  of their 
transcriptomic  programme,  and they do so by  a set of common  regulators  they share  with 
the ongoing  immune  response.

Therapeutic  modulation  of the immune  system  for clinical benefit in  cancer  patients  has 
been  demonstrated  by numerous  modalities  including  antibody  blockade  of inhibitory  
molecules,  adoptive  T cell transfer,  and autologous  cell-based  vaccines34-37. Treg  cells are 
generally  considered  to be the  most potent  inhibitor of antitumor immunity  and are 
suspected  to be responsible  for the limited  response  rates  to current immun otherapeutic  
regimens11. Analysis  of tumor infiltrating  lymphocyte  (TIL)  subset  composition  has shown  a 
clear  association  between  the composition  of the infiltrate  and patient survival.  TIL 
composed  of primarily  cytotoxic  T cells are generally  associated  with a favorable  
prognosis,  where  as TIL with a predominance  of Treg cells correlate  with poor outcomes38- 
40. 
 
Recruitment  of Treg cells into the tumor microenvironment  is likely  secondary to a number  
of factors. Chemokines  are a superfamily  of chemotactic  cytokines  that control leukocyte  
migration  through  G protein -coupled  receptors on target  cells41. The chemokine  receptor  
CCR4  has been  shown  to be important  for trafficking  of Treg cells and this function  is 
critical  for Treg cell-mediated  suppression  of inflammation42. CCR4  is the  receptor  for CC- 
chemokine ligand  17 (CCL17)  and CCL2243. Chemokines  are considered  to play a role 
both in the recruitment  of immune  and inflammatory  cells for anti-tumor response  and in 
the selective  homing  of neoplastic  B and T cells44. In normal  tissue, CCR4  is known  to be  
selectively  expressed  on a subset of activated  Th2 type CD4+ T cells that produce  
inflammatory cytokines  such  as interleukin  (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and  has garnered  
attention  as a molecular target for the treatment  of allergic  disorders  such  as asthma,  
atopic  dermatitis  or allergic  rhinitis45-49. CCR4  is also expressed  on primed human  Treg 
cells,  activated  natural  killer (NK) cells,  basophils, monocyte s, and platelets50-53. The 
CCR4  ligands,  CCL17 and  CCL22,  share  37% homology, are both encoded  on 
chromosome  16, and  are highly  expressed  in the thymus,  lymph  nodes,  and skin, but  
barely  expressed  in other  tissues44,54. MDC  and TARC  are synthesized mostly  by 
macrophages and  dendritic  cells43,47. 
CCR4  has been  shown  to play a central role  in Treg homing  to the skin where  they 
regulate  local immune  homeostasis  55. Reduced  levels  of skin associated  Treg has been  
found  to coexist  with numerous  immune  related  skin diseases. Circulating  and skin 
CCR4+  Treg have  been  shown  to be  reduced  in patients  with dermatomyositis  56. Treg  
function  has been  found  to be  significantly  impaired  in patients  with toxic epidermal

CD44  necrolysis  57. Similarly,  administration  of Treg has been shown  to prevent experimental  
TEN in mice  58. Treg may also function  to limit skin related  autoimmunity  as suggested  by 
a reduced  homing  of functional  Treg in patients  with vitiligo  59. Treatment  of human  
subjects  with an anti-CCR4  antibody  has been  shown  deplete  skin associated  Treg, lead  
to an  altered  skin immune  microenvironment,  and potentially  be associated  with skin 
immunopathology  60. The accumulated  data regarding Treg  mediated  immune  
homeostasis  suggests  CCR4  to be  a major  factor  in Treg homing  to the skin and clinical  
studies  involving  interrupting  this mechanism should  account  for this both in monitoring  for 
adverse  events  as well as a potential biomarker  of response.

Accumulation of CCR4+ Treg has been  shown  to occur  in colon  adenocarcinomas  and 
correlates  with a reduced  frequency  of effector T cells61. Ovarian  tumors, Hodgkin  
lymphoma,  and breast cancers  are found  to contain  large  amounts of CCL22  that 
correlates  with the presence  of tumor infiltrating  Treg40,62-64. Treg cell migration can be  
inhibited through  CCR4 blockade65. Activated Treg  cells preferentially  express  CCR4  over 
conventional T cells, which  is important  when  considering  immunotherapeutic  targeting  of 
Treg cells via CCR466,67. A small  molecule  inhibitor  of CCR4  designed  in silico has been  
shown  to prevent the interactio n of CCL22  and CCL17  with CCR4  and consequently  
inhibit  the recruitment  of Treg cells in experimental  models68. Further work  with this 
molecule showed  that CCR4  antagonism could  enhance  dendritic  cell−mediated  CD4+ T 
cell proliferation  in vitro as well as offer potent  adjuvant  activity  in an in vivo viral infection  
model69. Similarly,  in tumor models, CCR4  antagonism  induced  expansion  of antigen  
specific  CD8+ T cells,  and in combination  with vaccination,  promoted  tumor  immunity70. 
Excluding  skin malignancies,  breast cancer  is the most common  cancer among  women  
and the second  leading  cause  of cancer  death in women71. Clinically,  pathologic  
evaluation  of breast cancer  specimens  has revealed  the prognostic  value  of certain  
histopathologic  features  of breast tumors  that reflect  alterations  in the microenvironment

 including  lymphocytic  infiltration,  fibrosis, and  angiogenesis.  While breast  cancer  has not 
traditionally  been  considered  an immunogenic  tumor,  evidence  of tumor infiltrating  
lymphocytes  (TILs)  and their subset  composition  paralleling  disease  progression  suggest  
that the immune  response may be importan t72,73. The clinical relevance  of tumor  infiltrating  
T cells has been  intensively  studied74. An increased  ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells 
correlates  with lymph  node  metastases  and reduced overall  surviva l75. The tumor  
microenvironment can also influence  the recruitment  and regulation  of immune  cells in 
breast  tumors76,77. High levels  of Treg cells in breast  tumors  is associated  with an invasive  
phenotype and  diminished relapse -free as well as overall  survival57,58,60. In addition,  a 
substantial decrease  in the number  of breast  tumor  infiltrating  Treg cells is positively  
associated with a pathological response  to neoadjuvant  chemotherapy56. 
Breast cancer is  a heterogeneous  disease  and is generally  classified  into three  basic  
therapeutic  groups, based  on the expression  of the estrogen  receptor (ER),  progesterone  
receptor  (PR), and  HER278. Triple  negative  breast  cancers  (TNBC),  also known  as basal - 
like breast cancers  lack the expression  of ER, PR,  and HER279. These  tumors  account  for 
up to  15% of all invasive  breast cancers  and are frequently  observed  in patients  with 
BRCA1  germline  mutations  and of African  ancestry.  TNBC  characteristically  are densely  
infiltrated  by lymphocytes  suggestive  of an anti-tumor response, yet  are associated  with a 
more  aggressive  clinical  course  characterized  by shorter  survival  and higher  risk of 
metastases80. This paradox  is hypothesized  to be  secondary to effective  immune  
suppression  by the tumor microenvironment with preclinical data  implicating  Treg cells.  
Foxp3  expression  among  tumor infiltrating  lymphocytes  is significantly  associated  with the 
TNBC subtype  of invasive  breast  cancers81. High levels  of Treg cell infiltration  of TNBCs  is 
associated shorter survival82. TNBC  represents  a relevant  target for  immunotherapy  as 
there  is a robust  pre-existing  infiltrate  which  can potentially   mount an anti-tumor response  
once  the Treg cell−mediated  immunosuppression  is diminished  through  KW-0761 - 
mediated Treg  cell depletion.  
 
The association  of Treg cell  accumulation  in the peripheral blood  and tumor  infiltrating  
lymphocytes  with clinical  outcome  is not limited  to patients  with breast  cancer.  As Treg 
cells represent  a central  mechanism of tumor  immune  evasion, robust  tumor infiltration  by 
Treg cells correlates  with poor survival in  patients  affected  by many  tumor types.  Gastric  
cancer  represents  one of the most common  causes of cancer -related  deaths  worldwide83. 
In metastatic  gastric  cancer, chemotherapy  remains  the mainstay  of therapy  and results  in 
objective response  rates  of only 20-40%, with a median overall  survival of 8-10 months84. 
This particularly  grim prognosis  has led to the investigation  of immunotherapy  as a means  
to improve  survival85. Promising  results  from initial trials  suggest that  gastric  cancer may 
be amenab le to treatment  by modulating  the immune  system.  A clinical trial investigating  
the use  of autologous  cytokine -induced  killer cells for locally  advanced  gastric  cancer  
patients  showed  significant  improvements  in disease -free and  overall  survival86. A 
significant amount of preclinical data  also suggests  that targeting  Treg cells in gastric  
cancer  holds  therapeutic  promise.  A study  of 133 patients  with gastric  cancer revealed  that 
high numbers  of intratumoral  Treg cells significantly  correlated  presence  of lymph  node  
metastases and was an independent factor for  adverse  overall  survival87. Regulatory  T 
cells from patients  with gastric  cancer  have  also been  shown  to produce  the

 immunosuppressive  cytokines  IL-4 and IL-10, and  inhibit  cytokine  production  from CD4+ T 
cells in vitro88. Treg cell infiltration  of gastric  cancers may be in part related  to hypoxia,  a 
feature  common  to many  solid tumors. Treg  cell infiltration  into gastric  cancers  is positively  
correlated  with HIF-1α expression  and supernatants from gastric  cancer  cells cultured  in 
hypoxic  conditions  can induce  the expression  of Foxp3  in naïve  CD4+  T cells via TGF- 
β189. The well-documented  adverse  clinical correlation  of Treg cell infiltration  into gastric  
cancers,  and the preliminary  evidence  that they may be sensitive  to immunotherapy  
provide  the rationale  for targeting  this disease  with KW-0761.  
 
Lung  cancer is  the leading  cause of cancer deaths  worldwide.  The overall  5-year survival  
rate for advanced  non-small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  is 2%-4%, depending  on 
geographic  location90. Whereas  renal cell  carcinoma and melanoma  are traditionally  
considered  immunogenic,  as evidenced  by spontaneous  regressions  and occasional  
dramatic  responses  to high-dose  IL-2, NSCLC has been  notoriously  resistant to 
immunotherapy91,92.  Pre-clinical data suggest that the immune  system may  have  a role in 
this disease. High  levels  of CD4+/CD8+ T cells infiltrating  resected  NSCLC tumors  are 
associated  with a favorable  prognosis  and high levels  of infiltrating  Treg cells are 
associated with increased  risk of relapse93,94. In early -stage  NSCLC the ratio of Treg cells 
to CD3+  TILs correlates  with disease  specific  survival  and can reliably  distinguish  patients  
with tumors  who are at high risk for recurrence95,96. Genetic  evidence  pointing  to the role of 
Treg cells in the risk of developing  NSCLC was documented  by determining  the presence  
of a single  nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP)  associated  with Graves  disease  in a cohort of 
patients  with NSCLC and healthy  controls.  The study  demonstrated  a significant  
association of this SNP with a risk of developing NSCLC97. Recently  there have  been  
significant breakthroughs  in harnessing  the immune  system though  the use of checkpoint  
blockade  inhibitory antibodies  to treat NSCLC.  In a Phase  I dose  escalation  study of 207 
patients  treated  with an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody,  a response  rate of 10% was 
observed in  patients  with NSCLC98. Another  Phase  I dose -escalation  study  of 296 patients  
treated  with an anti-PD-1 antibody  reported  a response  rate of 18% in patients  with 
NSCLC99. Based  on the association  of Treg cells with the clinical course  of NSCLC  
patients  as well as the  significant  pool of proof -of-principle  clinical data  that immune  
modulation  can yield therapeutic  responses  in this disease, KW -0761  is a promising  
therapeutic  modality  for NSCLC patients.  
 
 
3.1 Preliminary  Data  
 
Preliminary  data from the  laboratory  of Dr. Rudensky  at the Sloan -Kettering  Institute  
supports  the notion  that specific  ablation  of Treg cells is also effective  in experimental  
models  of breast cancer.  Using  a poorly  immunogenic,  oncogene  driven  breast  cancer cell  
line in an orthotopic  model of mammary  carcinom a, we show  that Treg cells significantly  
contribute  to breast cancer  progression  and metastasis. For these  studies, we made use  
of a knock -in mouse  generated  in our laboratory  where  the Foxp3  locus  controls  
expression of the human  diphtheria  toxin  (DT) receptor (Foxp3DTR)100. In these mice,  
administration  of DT leads  to the rapid  and specific  ablation  of Treg cells.  Mice  expressing  
a transgene  encoding  the Polyoma  middle  T antigen  (PyMT)  under a mammary  gland

specific  promoter leads  to the rapid  development  of mammary  tumors  and lung metastasis  
faithfully  recapitulating  human  breast cancer  carcinogenesis101. To determine  the role of 
Treg cells in this process,  we orthotopically  implanted  1x105 PyMT  tumor  cells in the 
inguinal mammary  glands  of Foxp3DTR mice  which,  when  left untreated,  developed  
uniformly  growing  mammary tumors  that metastasized  to the  lungs  with complete  
penetrance  in approximately  3 to 4 weeks.  If Treg  cells were  ablated  by injection  of 25 
μg/kg  of DT on 2 consecutive  days  after tumor  reached  approximately  100 mm3, the 
primary  tumor  growth  of large  established  tumors  was significantly  hindered  (Fig. 1). In 
addition,  this treatment  also resulted in  the almost complete  disappearance  of metastatic  
tumor  nodules  in the lungs  (Fig. 2). Analysis  of TILs by flow cytometry  revealed  that Treg  
cell ablation  leads  to a dramatic  increase  in the proportion  of TILs represented  by CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3A,B), as well as an  increase  in activated  CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3B,C).  
This finding  again  supports  the hypothesis  that Treg cells actively  suppress  potentially  
beneficial endogenous  anti-tumor immune  responses.  
 
Unfortunately,  there  are no readily  available  means  of selectively  targeting  Treg cells in 
humans. Preclinical models  support the notion  that Treg  cells are central  to the regulation  
of immune  responses  to many  different types  of cancer.  Our own preliminary data  reveal  
that the specific  ablation  of Treg cells in advanced  murine  breast tumors leads  to a 
significant delay  in tumor  growth  and reduction  in metastatic  burden.  These  data suggest  
targeting  Treg cells with KW-0761  may be useful  in the treatment of a wide variety  of 
cancers and  support  its evaluation  in this study.

 lymphoma  (CTCL),  and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma  (ATL).  KW-0761  was produced  
using  technology  developed  by Kyowa  Hakko  Kirin Co., Ltd., that eliminates  fucose  from 
the carbohydrate  structure  of the antibody.  It contains  2 heavy  and 2 light chains  linked  
together  by 16 disulfide  bonds. Glycosylation  of KW -0761 occurs at amino  acid Asn299  
and the mAb has typical biante nnary  structure  lacking  a core fucose.  KW-0761  has a 
molecular  weight of ~149,000  Daltons  and an isoelectric  point (pI) range  of ~8.1 to 8.7. 
Due to the absence  of fucose  from the complex -type oligosaccharide  at the constant (Fc)  
region,  KW-0761  has enhanced  antibody -dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity (ADCC)  activity,  
but does  not exhibit  any complement  dependent cytotoxic  (CDC)  activity  or neutralizing  
activity  of the ligand  of CCR4.  In vitro, the EC50  for ADCC  against human  T-cell 
lymphoma  cell lines is between  0.01 and 0.1 μg/ml.  
 
 
KW-0761  has potent cytolytic  activity  against  CCR4 -expressing  target cells,  and has been  
shown  in in vivo non-clinical studies  to eliminate the  T-helper 2 (Th2) subset  of T cells that 
express  this chemokine  receptor.  When  compared  to conventional T cells CCR4  is 
preferentially  expressed  in Treg,  both in mice and humans66,67. KW-0761  therefore is a 
promising  immunotherapeutic  agent  targeting  Treg induced  immunosuppression  in the 
tumor microenvironment.  There  is substantial preliminary  data in the published  work  on 
KW-0761  that suggests  it can target  Treg.  A recently  published  phase II study  of KW-0761  
for relapsed  ATL showed  that compared  to healthy  controls, KW -0761  led to a significant  
and lasting  decrease  in the  number  of CD4+CCR4+ but not  CD4+CCR4- or CD8+CD4- cells 
in patients  with ATL (Fig. 4)102. Further  subset  analysis  of CD4 T cells showed  that there  
was a significant depletion  of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells,  which  included  both ATL cells and 
endogenous  non-ATL Treg. The ability  of KW-0761  to deplete Treg  was also examined  in 
a phase  I/II clinical trial in patients  with cutaneous  T cell-lymphoma  (CTCL)103. KW-0761  
in these patients  led to a significant reduction  in circulating  Treg as well as Foxp3  mRNA  
as compared  to pretreatment levels  (Fig 5).

 In vitro and in vivo pharmacology  studies  have  demonstrated  the immunologic  and anti- 
tumor  effects  of KW-0761.  KW-0761  has been  examined  for safety  and toxicology  in non- 
human  primates  with little toxicity.  The No Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level (NOAEL)  in a 
13 week  repeat dose  toxicology  study  conducted  in Cynomolgus  monkeys  was 40 mg/kg,  
the highest dose  evaluated.  Additionally,  an embryo -fetal development study  performed  in 
Cynomolgus  monkeys  demonstrated  that the NOAEL for general  toxicity  and reproductive  
function  in dams  was 40 mg/kg.  
 
In preliminary  human  clinical trials,  doses  of up to 1.0 mg/kg  have  been well tolerated.  As 
of 03 December  2012,  approximately  243 subjects  have  received  at least one  dose of KW- 
0761  in clinical studies.  Efficacy  has been  demonstrated  in subjects  with T-cell lymphoma  
including  ATL, CTCL,  and PTCL,  with overall  response rates  (ORRs) ranging  from 31% to 
50%.  Adverse  events  (AEs)  have  generally  been  mild to moderate  in severity.  In three  
studies  in subjects  with T-cell lymphoma  in the US and Japan, the most frequent  
treatment -emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs) that  were  considered  at least possibly  
related  to study  drug include  infusion  related  reaction  (53%),  decreased  lymphocyte  count  
(48%), pyrexia  (47%),  chills  (40%),  decreased  white  blood  cell count (33%), rash/drug  
eruption  (32%),  decreased  neutrophil  count (28%),  decreased  platelet count (27%), and  
nausea  (21%).  For the 1.0 mg/kg  dose  level (regimen=once  per week  for the first 4 weeks  
then every other  week), the  mean  (SD) half-life values  were  184 (64) and 332 (86) hours  
on Days  1 and 22, respectively.  
 
POTELIGEO® (mogamulizumab)  was approved  by the Ministry  of Health,  Labor  and 
Welfare  in Japan  on 30  March  2012, for the treatment of relapsed  or refractory  CCR4 - 
positive  ATL.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a Phase  I/II single  institution  study. Phase  I of the study  will be an open  label,  non- 
randomized,  dose  escalation,  and safety study  in adults  with histologically  confirmed  
metastatic  solid tumor  malignancies.  Subjects  who sign an Informed  Consent form  and 
who meet the eligibility  criteria will be enrolled  to receive  a weekly  intravenous  (IV) dose  of 
KW-0761  ranging  from 0.5 mg/kg  to 10.0 mg/kg  as feasible  starting  on Day 1 for 4 weeks.  
In the absence  of toxicity  or progression  of disease,  patients  may continue  receiving  KW- 
0761  for up to 12 months.  Subsequent treatment  courses  will consist  of an infusion  every  
other  week  (Figure  6). Following  the end of treatment or treatment  completion  date,  a 24- 
week  short term follow -up (STFU) period  of observation  will begin.  If a subject  
discontinues  from the study for reasons  other than  DLT prior to receivi ng four complete  
infusions  (Week  4), the subject will be replaced.  Subsequent treatment courses  are 
permissible  for subjects  demonstrating  a response  or maintaining  stable  disease  and will 
consist  of an infusion  of KW-0761 every other  week.  
 
Subjects will undergo  assessments  with each  dosing  visit during  Course  one and Course  
2 and at weeks  2, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 following  the last dose  (Figure  6). Telephonic

up visits  in clinic  during  this period  as needed  to evaluate  and/or  treat any  adverse  event  
(AEs).  
 
Phase  II of the study  will enroll  a total of 48 subjects, 16 patients  in 3 tumor -specific  
expansion  cohorts  each  treated at the RP2D (MTD,  or highest dose  tested in  Phase  I part 
of trial).  The 3  tumor -specific  expansion  cohorts  will include  NSCLC,  gastric  
adenocarcinoma,  and triple -negative  breast adenocarcinoma  (TNBC).  
 
The following  definition  will be used  to identify  TNBC  subjects:  
 
• <1% immunohistochemical staining  for the estrogen  receptor AND  
 
• <1% immunohistochemical staining  for the progester one receptor AND  
 
• 0-1+on  IHC staining  for HER2  or FISH  not amplified  as per the ASCO/CAP  
guidelines  (single -probe  average  HER2  copy  number <4.0  signals/cell;  dual-probe  
HER2/CEP17  ratio <2.0 with an average  HER2  copy  number <4.0 signals/cell).  
 
These  cohorts  were  chosen  because  they are abundantly  infiltrated  by Treg cells, the 
proposed  target  of KW-0761  (Section 3.0,  Background  and Rationale)  104-106. As the Phase  
II part of the study  requires  specific  tumor types  there  will be no overlap  of patients  from 
the Phase  I to the Phase  II component  of the study.

 In the first treatment  course,  KW-0761  will be administered  i.v. once  a week for four weeks  
(Cycle  1) and subsequently  every 2 weeks  for 4 weeks  (Cycle  2). Subsequent treatment  
courses  are permissible  for subjects  demonstrating  a response  or maintaining  stable  
disease  and will consist of an infusion  of KW-0761  every other  week. Each  subsequent  
course  (treatment  course  2, treatment course  3, etc.) will be defined  as completion  of two 
additional infusions  of KW-0761  over 4 weeks.  If a subject experiences  an overall  CR, the 
subject may continue  on study  for up to an additional four infusions  beyond  CR, then  
discontinue  treatment  in order  to determine  duration  of response. If  a subject  experiences  
a PR  or SD, the subject  may continue  therapy  for up to one  year or until disease  
progression  occurs  or other  withdrawal  criteria are met (refer to Section  4.8, Criteria  for 
Study  Termination).  If a subject  are not available  for administration  of KW-0761  a 3 day 
window  before  or after the  scheduled  dose  date will be allowed.  
 
4.3 Dose  Escalation  
 
Standard  3+3 cohorts  for safety  and DLT detection  will be utilized  (Table  1). Each  cohort  
will consist  of at least three  subjects. If  DLT is observed  in 0/3 subjects,  escalation  to the 
next dose  level will occur. If  DLT detected  in 1 of 3 subjects, then  three  more  subjects  will 
be added  at that dose  level.  If DLT is demonstrated  in an additional subject, dose  
escalation  will cease  (see Table  6 for a summary).  The dose  will depend  on the  cohort  in 
which  they have  been enrolled.  Subjects  will be assigned  sequentially to a cohort  in the 
order  screening  is completed.  No effort will be made  to stratify  types  of subjects  into a 
particular cohort (e.g.,  reserve  more  severe  subjects  or tumor distribution  patterns  for the 
higher doses).  
 
In the absence  of progression  or toxicity  subjects  may continue  treatment  up to  one year.  
If a subject  experiences  an overall  CR, the subject may continue  on study  for up to an 
additional  four infusions  beyond  CR, then discontinue  treatment  in order to  determine  
duration  of response. If  a subject experiences  a PR or SD, the subject may continue  
therapy  after consultation  between  the investigator  and the Principal  Investigator until  
disease  progression  occurs  or other withdrawal  criteria are met (refer to Section  4.8, 
Criteria  for Study  Termination).

 4.4 Study  Conduct  
 
Table  2 is a tabular view  of the Study  Assessments.  
 
Visit 1 is designated  as Day 1 and the  day of KW-0761  administration.  Screening  for 
criteria  will begin  no more  than 30 days  prior to KW-0761  dosing  on Day 1 with the signing  
of the ICF. Unless  otherwise  specified,  all screening  assessments  should  be performed  
during  this period. Assessments  required  for screening  eligibility that are already  available  
in a subject's  medical  records  at the time the subject  is consented  may be used  to satisfy  
screening  requirements  as long as they have  been  obtained  within  30 days  of the planned  
KW-0761  dosing  on Day 1. If screening  assessment results  for eligibility  are not available  
in a subject's  medical  record  then they must  be obtained  to estab lish eligibility.  Pathologic  
review  of most recent  biopsy  for confirmation  of diagnosis  will be obtained  during  the 
screening  period. The imaging  studies  for TNM  staging  that will be used  to establish  
eligibility  and baseline  must  have  been  performed  within  30 days  of KW-0761  dosing.  For 
women  of child bearing  potential a negative  urine  pregnancy  test must  be documented  on 
Day 1 prior to KW-0761  dose  administration. Information  to be collected  during  the Long - 
term Follow -up will include:  vital status; treatments  received  post KW-0761  dosing. This  
information  will be sought first  from hospital  and/or  outpatient medical records. If the 
subject  has not been  seen  for follow -up care in the 30 days  prior to scheduled  visit, then a 
study  staff member  will contact  the subject by telephone  to collect  information  regarding  
vital status  and treatments.

1Since  the bowel  habits  of individual  subjects  may vary widely  it is likely  that not all of  the collections  may be possible.  Subjects  are to bring  in samples  when  feasible.  If a 
subject  misses  collections  they will be allowed  to continue  on the study.  
 
2If a site of tumor  is readily  available  as a cutaneous  lesion  a simple  punch  or excisional  biopsy  under  local  anesthesia  can be performed  by the principal  investigator  or 
qualified  personnel.  If however  tumor  is not as readily  accessible  then an image -guided  core needle  biopsy  will be obtained  following  consultation  with the radiology  staff to 
determine  the overall  risk of the procedure.  Invasive  procedures  that require  general  anesthesia  should  not be performed  to obtain  a biopsy  specimen.  If a surgical  procedure  
is performed  for a clinical  indication  a sample  may be used  for research  purposes.  During  the course  of treatment  a decision  may be made  to perform  the post-treatment  
biopsy  earlier  than 15 days  if there  is evidence  to suggest  a possibility  that by day 15 there  will be no available  tumor  for biopsy  due to a rapid  clinical  response.  Similarly  
tumor  biopsy  may be delayed  if there  is evidence  of a delayed  response.  
 
3Tumor  imaging  will occur  on even  courses  starting with cycle  4.

4.5 Assessments  
 
As shown  in Table  2, screening  assessments  will be performed  to determine  eligibility.  At a minimum,  
demography, medical and disease  history,  concurrent and  recently  taken  medications,  and laboratory  
and physical examination  results  will be reviewed  to confirm that  a subject is  eligible  to screen  for 
enrollment.  An original  medical history including  complete  past medical and surgical history, review  of 
systems, complete  history  of present  illness  for all active  medical and  surgical problems,  and current  
prescription  and non-prescription  medications  will be recorded.  
 
 
4.5.1  Vital Signs  
 
Vital signs  including  temperature, respiratory  rate, heart rate, and  blood  pressure  will be recorded  at 
each  visit. During  Phase  1, vital signs  will be checked  and recorded prior to  administration  of KW-0761,  
every 15 minutes (+ 5 minutes)  during  infusion  for the first treatment course  and midway  through  and at 
the end of the infusion  on subsequent treatment courses.  Vital signs  will also be measured  every 30 
minutes  (+ 5 minutes)  for the first hour following  administration  of KW-0761.  During  Phase  2 of the 
study,  vital signs  will be checked  and recorded  prior to start of infusion  and at the  end of the infusion.

Page  23 of 63  
 4.5.2  Physical  Examination  
 
Complete  physical examinations  will be performed  at Screening/Baseline  to document that  candidates  
meet all  eligibility  criteria  and will be repeated  weekly  during  the core study  period  and with every short - 
term follow -up visit. Height  will be recorded  at Baseline.  Weight  will be recorded  at Baseline, at the end 
of Cycle  1 and  at the end of Cycle  2. Complete  examinations  include  all major organ  systems. The 
Investigator will preferably  complete these  examinations.  
 
Directed  physical examinations  can be performed  by study  staff at other  points  if deemed  necessary  by 
clinical presentation  of the subject.  
 
4.5.3  Electrocardiogram  (ECG)  
 
A 12-lead ECG will be obtained  and recorded  at Screening  Baseline  (Days  -35 to -1) and prior to the 
initial  KW-0761dose. Additional ECGs  will be obtained  only as clinically  indicated.  
4.5.4  Tumor  Imaging  for AJCC  TNM  Staging  
 
Chest, abdominal, pelvic,  and CNS imaging  scans  will be documented  at Screening  / Baseline  to stage  
subject's  tumor according  to the American  Joint Committee  on Cancer  Tumor -Node  Metastases (AJCC  
TNM)  scoring  system.  As noted  in Section  4.4, the imaging  studies  used  to stage  the subject's  tumor  
may have  been obtained  as part of the subject's  routine  cancer  care prior to  study  enrollment  but must  
have  been obtained  within  30 days  of KW-0761  dosing  on Day 1. 
 
4.5.5  Laboratory  Assessments  
 
The following  laboratory evaluations  at Screening  / Baseline  and Day1  prior to KW-0761  dosing  to 
document eligibility  and establish  baseline  values.  
 
• Serum creatinine  (Cr) ≤1.5  X upper limit of normal  (ULN)  
• Serum total bilirubin  (T-Bil) ≤1.5 X ULN (prior  diagnosis  or past history  consistent with Gilbert 's 
syndrome  is an exception)  
• Serum aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  ≤2.5 X ULN 
• Platelets  (Plts) ≥ 100,000  cells/µl  
• Hemoglobin  (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL 
• Absolute  neutrophil  count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm3 
 
Serum chemistry  [including  sodium  (Na),  potassium (K), chloride  (Cl), carbon  dioxide  (C02),  albumin  
(Alb),  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP),  Bil total, aspartate  transaminase  (AST),  alanine  transaminase  (ALT),  
blood  urea nitrogen  (BUN),  total protein  (TP),  calcium  (Ca), creatinine  (Cr), phosphorus  (Phos),  glucose  
(Glu),  and lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)],  CBC  with differential,  and urinalysis  (U/A)  will be performed  
prior to KW-0761  dosing. All  of these  will be repeated  as shown  in Table  2. Additional laboratory  tests  
will be repeated  as needed.  
4.5.6  Pregnancy  Screen  
 
For women  of childbearing  potential,  urine  pregnancy  testing  will be performed  at Screening  / Baseline  
and on Day 1 prior to dosing.

 4.5.7  Adverse  Events  (AE) Assessment  
 
Evaluation  of AEs will occur  continuously  throughout the study.   Scheduled  safety  assessments  
including  AE reporting  is shown  in Table  2. The definition  and reporting  of AE are described  in Section  
9. During  Phase  1, subjects  who do not complete  the first four infusions  for reasons  other than  a DLT 
will be replaced.  Based  on the tolerability  of KW-0761  in previous  trials  we expect  a very low  drop-out 
rate. If a subject  begins  a new  treatment  investigational  or otherwise following  participation  in this study  
information  regarding  adverse  events  will continue  to be collected  but will not be considered  secondary  
to KW-0761.  
4.6 Number  of Subjects  
 
Enrollment  of up to 72 subjects  is planned. Of  the 72 subjects  a maximum  of 24 will be enrolled  in the 
dose  escalation  part of this study  and the remaining  48 will be enrolled  to 3 tumor -specific  expansion  
cohorts.  Depending  on the dose  escalation  cohort, 2 to 5 additional subjects  may be added  to a cohort  
in whom  a dose limiting  toxicity  has been  observed  to confirm results. During  Phase  1, subjects  who do 
not complete  the first four infusions  for reasons  other than  a DLT will be replaced.  
4.7 Treatment  Assignment  
 
After informed  consent  has been obtained, subjects  will be assigned  a sequential  screening  number  
when  screen procedures  commence.  Subjects  are assigned  a screening  number after  signing  the 
informed  consent form and  prior to conducting  any other  study -related  procedures.  Those  who 
withdraw  or screen  fail after being  assigned  a screening  number will retain  that number and  the 
screening  number will not be reassigned  to another  subject. Upon  meeting  all eligibility  requirements  
and receiving  KW-0761,  subjects  will be assigned  a sequential study  number.  The first subject  will be 
given  the number  0001, the  second  will be 0002, and  so on. This subject number will be maintained  
throughout the study.  
 
Subjects will be enrolled  and dosed in sequential  cohorts  as outlined  in the dosing  schedule  (Table  1). 
The Principal  Investigator  will conduct  safety  monitoring  and cohort  dosing  will proceed  conservatively.  
Prior to initiating  dosing, the Investigator will send  selected  screening  data on the  Eligibility Checklist to 
the Principal  Investigator  for review  and approval.  Following  enrollment  of the first (sentinel)  subject  into 
a cohort  and review  of that subject's  data through  Day 8 (see Section  4.4), the Principal  Investigator will 
determine  if additional subjects  may be enrolled  in that cohort.  
 
Details  regarding  safety  criteria  for advancing  or stopping  subjects  are summarized  in Section  9.5 and 
Table  6. 
4.8 Criteria  for Study  Termination  
 
Safety -related  Stopping  Rules  are outlined  in Section  9.5. If  a Stopping  Rule is met, then  further  
enrollment will cease  and all available  data on all subjects  enrolled  thus far will be reviewed  by the and 
Principal  Investigator to determine  if the study  should  proceed  and if so, what changes  must  be 
implemented.

Amended:  17-AUG -2016  
Page  25 of 63  
 5.1.1  Description  
 
The KW-0761  drug product  will be provided  as an injectable  solution, contained  in single -use, 
ready -to-use 10 mL vials.  Each vial contains  5 mL of a 4 mg/mL  solution  of KW-0761  drug 
substance  in a colorless  glass  vial with fluoropolymer coated  butyl rubber stoppers  and 
polypropylene  flipoff  cap with aluminum overseal.  
 
5.1.2  Preparation  of Dose  
 
The dose  and volume  of the study  drug to be administered  will be dependent  upon  the  
subject’s  weight.  If the subject’s  body  weight  changes  10% or more  at any time during  the study  
relative  to Day 1, subsequent  doses  of the study  drug should  be adjusted  relative  to the new 
weight.  
 
The appropriate  volume  of KW-0761  based  on weight will be withdrawn  and diluted  into 
normal saline  (NS, 0.9% sodium  chloride). KW -0761  can be  diluted  with normal saline  to various  
concentrations  ranged  (0.07  to 1.44 mg/mL  in a 250-mL bag; 0.19 to 2.40 mg/mL  in a 
500-mL bag; or 0.10 to 1.20 mg/mL  in a 1000 -mL bag) and stored  at 25°C  for up to 24  hours  to 
effectively  deliver  the planned  clinical doses.  However,  since  there  are no preservatives,  it is 
recommended  the product  be used  within  8 hours.  KW-0761  will then be filtered  through  a 0.22 μm 
protein -sparing/low -protein  binding  in-line filter. Refer to the KW-0761  Pharmacy  Manual  for additional  
details.  
 
 
5.2 Study  Drug  Administration  
 
Subjects will receive  KW-0761 as  an i.v. infusion  over 1 hour  for the 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg  dose, 1.5 hours  
for the 3.0 mg/kg  dose and 2 hours  for the 10 mg/kg  dose. Subjects  will be observed  closely  for 1 hour 
following  each  administration  of KW-0761  for any potential AEs  in an area with resuscitation  
equipment. During  Phase  1, vital signs  (including  temperature,  pulse, respiratory  rate, and  blood  
pressure ) will be checked  and recorded  prior to administration  of KW-0761,  every 15 minutes (±  5 
minutes)  during  infusion  for the first treatment  course  and midway  through  and at the end  of the 
infusion  on subsequent  treatment courses.  Vital signs  will also be measured  every 30 minutes  (± 5 
minutes)  for the first hour following  administration  of KW-0761. During  Phase  2 of the study,  vital signs  
will be checked  and recorded  prior to start of infusion  and at the end of the infusion.  
 
KW-0761  should  only be administered  under the supervision  of a qualified  physician.  Premedication  
with acetaminophen  650 mg orally and diphenhydramine  50 mg i.v. or other  antihistamine  will be 
administered  to all subjects.  In the event  that a subject experiences  a grade  1 or 2 hypersensitivity  
reaction, the KW-0761  administration  time may be increased. If  this is not effective,  removal of the 
subject from the study  should  be considered.  Should  a hypersensitivity  reaction  to KW-0761  occur, the 
subject must  be treated  according  to the best available  medical  practices.  Subjects should  be 
instructed  to report  any delayed  reactions  to the investigator  immediately.

IRB#: 14-135 A(8) 
Amended:  17-AUG -2016  
Page  26 of 63  
 For this  study,  KW-0761  is formulated  at 20 mg/vial in  2.1 mM sodium  citrate  buffer, pH 5.5 containing  
300 mM glycine,  and 0.02%  polysorbate  80 (Tween  80). KW-0761  should  be stored  at a temperature  
of 2°C to 8°C. Drug  supplies  must  be kept in  a secure, limited  access  storage  area under the 
recommended  storage  conditions.  
 
5.4 Packaging  and Labeling  of KW-0761  
 
KKP will distribute  the study drug to  the pharmacies  at the  study  site. Vial labels  will bear the 
appropriate  text as required  by regulatory  agencies.  At a minimum, the label will include:  
• appropriate  cautionary  statement  limiting,  by Federal  Law, the new drug to investigational  use; 
• product  name  (KW-0761)  
• drug storage  requirements  
• lot number  
 
5.5 Drug  Accountability  
 
The Principal  Investigator  and pharmacy  at the study  site are responsible  for maintaining  
accurate  records  of the receipt,  dispensing,  and return  of all investigational  materials. The 
Investigator may dispense  study  drug only to subjects  enrolled  in the study.  All dispensing  
must  be from the site listed  in the FDA form 1572.  Under no circumstance  will the 
Investigator allow  study  drug to be  used other  than as directed  by the protocol.  
 
5.6 Return  and Destruction  
 
Upon  completion  or termination  of the study, all  unopened  vials of KW-0761  must  be 
destroyed  at the site. Disposal of these  containers  should  occur  at the investigational center  according  
to the investigational site’s  standard  chemotherapy  or biohazardous  waste procedures. It will be the  
Investigator’s  responsibility  to arrange  for disposal  of all drug products with containers, provided  that 
procedures  for proper disposal have  been established  according  to applicable  regulations  and 
institutional  guidelines  and procedures, and  provided  that appropriate  records  of disposal are  kept.  A 
copy  of the certificate  of destruction  must  be placed  in the  trial master  file. If the institutional  site is 
unable  to dispose  of the study  drug,  then KKP should  be contacted  to arrange  for destruction. All  KW- 
0761  returned  to should  be accompanied  by the appropriate  documentation  and be clearly  identified  by 
protocol  number  on the outermost shipping  container. Returned  supplies  should  be in the original  
containers  (i.e., subject study  drug containers  that have  clinical labels  attached).  Refer to the KW-0761  
Pharmacy  Manual  for additional details.  
 
 
5.7 KW-0761  Clinical Safety  
 
As of December  03, 2012,  approximately  243 study  subjects  have  received  at least one  dose  of KW- 
0761  (doses  of KW-0761  ranging  from 0.0001  to 1.0 mg/kg  in clinical studies  of KW-0761) and  safety  
information  is summarized  in Investigator’s  Brochure  Edition  Number:9  (IB, see Appendix),  Section  
5.2.1.  Pooled  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs) and  serious  adverse  event  (SAE) data  
considered  at least possibly  related  to study  drug for KKP Study  KW-0761 -001 and KHK Studies  0761 - 
0501  and 0761 -002 are summarized  in IB Sections  5.2.1  and 5.2.1.1, respectively.  Individual study  
synopses  are provided  in IB Section  5.2.3.

 5.7.1  Safety  Summary  
 
The most frequently  observed  TEAEs  (≥ 10% of total subjects) that  were  considered  to be at least  
possibly  related  to KW-0761  in completed  studies  of subjects  with T-cell lymphoma  in the US and 
Japan  are presented  in Table  3. The TEAEs  observed  have  been  generally  mild to moderate  (≤ Grade  
2) in severity.  
 
Infusion  reaction  was the most common  TEAE.  Most  infusion  reactions  were  generally  mild to moderate  
in severity and  symptoms  (chills, fever,  headache,  etc.) were  similar  to what has been  observed  with 
other  monoclonal antibodies.  More  subjects  in the Japanese  studies  experienced  infusion  reactions  
than in the US, which  may be attributable  to more  frequent  and intensive  monitoring  in the in-patient  
hospital setting  and the way infusion reactions  are assessed  in Japan.  
 
Skin rashes,  including  drug eruptions, considered  to be at least possibly  related  to KW-0761  
administration  have  been  reported  in all studies. In the US Study  KW-0761 -001 in CTCL/PTCL  with a 
dosing  regimen  of four weekly  doses  followed  by one dose every other  week,  17% of subjects  (7 
subjects) experienced  a study  drug related  rash, most  of which  were  considered  mild or moderate  in 
severity.  One subject had a Grade  3 rash. In the Japanese  studies, study  drug related  rashes  were  
observed  in 25% of subjects (4 subjects)  in the Phase  1 Study  0761 -0501  (4 doses  given  weekly)  and 
59% of subjects  (16 subjects)  in the Phase  2 Study 0761 -002 (8 doses  given  weekly).  The incidence  
and severity of the rashes  observed  in subjects  in Japan is notably  greater than  what has been  
observed  in the study  conducted  in the US. This  may be related  to differences  in the dosing  regimen,  
differences  in underlying  biology  of the malignancies  and/or  differences  in

the underlying  genetic  predispositions  (most  subjects  in Japan  had ATL,  while  all but one in the US had 
CTCL). In the 0761 -002 study,  dosing  with KW-0761  was not required  to be discontinued  after the 
appearance  of rash,  which  was medically  treated. In this study  the number  of doses  received  was 
related  to both the incidence  and grade of the skin rashes.  After 4 weekly  doses, the incidence  of skin 
rash increased  markedly  with continued  weekly  dosing  and the most  severe  skin adverse  event  
experienced  by a patient in  this study  tended  to be with the highest  number  of doses.  Cutaneous  SAEs,  
including  rash and Stevens - Johnson  syndrome  that were  reported  as possibly  or probably  related  to 
KW-0761  are described  in Section  5.7.2.  
 
In the non-oncology  studies,  one subject in  a Phase  1 study  in asthma  (Study 20080407)  developed  a 
Grade  2 psoriasiform rash  after receiving  a single  dose  of KW-0761  (0.6 mg) administered  
subcutaneously.  
 
Most  rashes  observed  in the studies  in T-cell lymphomas  have  been  characterized  as spongiotic  
dermatitis, although  there  has been  some  variability  in presentation.  The rash observed  in the subject  
with asthma  was characterized  as psoriasiform. There  is also great  variability  in the time to onset of 
rash among  subjects. The  majority of subjects  with ATL and CTCL/PTCL have  underlying  skin 
involvement  and dysregulated  skin immunity  as a result  of the underlying  lymphoma/leukemia.  
Although  the mechanism is  unclear in  terms  of how skin rashes  develop  in these  oncology  subjects,  
rash appears  to be manageable  by temporarily  withdrawing  KW-0761  or adding  topical and/or  oral 
steroids.

 The most common  related  ≥ Grade  3 laboratory  TEAEs  included  lymphocyte  count  decreased  (35.3%),  
white  blood  cell count decreased  (11.8%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (9.4%) and  platelet count  
decreased  (5.9%).  Alterations  in lymphocyte  counts  were  anticipated  based  on the pharmacological  
activity  of KW-0761.  
5.7.2  Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
Forty -six SAEs  considered  at least possibly  related  to KW-0761  were  reported  for 32 subjects.  Data are 
presented  for all studies  in Table  4. 
 
Several  SAEs  have  been the  result of CMV  reactivation  (chorioretinitis,  pneumonia).  In Study  0761 - 
003, KW-0761  is given  in combination  with the chemotherapeutic  regimen,  mLSG15, in  subjects  with 
ATL.  Both the chemotherapeutic  regimen  and the disease  itself are immunosuppressive.  A recent  study  
demonstrated  that subclinical reactivation  of CMV  was common  (50.6%)  in ATL patients  receiving  
chemotherapy.44 Since  there  is a temporal  association between  the KW-0761  and chemotherapy  
infusions, relationship  to KW-0761  cannot be ruled  out. 
 
One subject  in Study  0761 -0501  with ATL experienced  hepatitis  B (HB) reactivation  following  treatment  
KW-0761. Blood  samples  obtained  from the subject  after the onset of symptoms  were  positive  for 
hepatitis  core antibody. Repeat  testing  confirmed  that HBs antigen  and HBs antibody  were  both 
negative  prior to antibody  treatment.  The protocol  did not require  testing  for hepatitis  B core antibody  or 
HBV-DNA  at the time the subject was enrolled  in the study.  The protocol  was subsequently  amended  to 
require  such  testing  to prevent  HBV activation  in other  subjects.  
 
One subject  in Study  0761 -0501  who received  4 weekly  infusions  of 0.01 mg/kg  of KW-0761  
experienced  herpes  zoster  on study  Day 99. Another  subject  in Study  0761 -004 experienced  herpes  
esophagitis  on study  Day 68. These  subjects  did not have  a prior history of herpes  infection.  
 
Seven  subjects  in clinical trials  experienced  SAEs  of rash and one subject  experienced  an SAE of 
Stevens -Johnson  syndrome (SJS) that  were  reported  as possibly  or probably  related  to KW-0761;  7 of 
these  subjects  were  treated  in Japanese  studies  of KW-0761. SJS  was reported  for a subject in  the 
Phase  2 ATL study  in Japan  (0761 -002). A 71-year-old woman  received  1 mg/kg  KW-0761  weekly  for 8 
weeks  and developed  a Grade  1 skin eruption  suspected  of being a drug eruption  related  to a 
concomitant medication  on Day 21. The skin eruption  worsened  over a period  of several  weeks  and the 
subject  was hospitalized  with SJS on Day 75. It should  be noted  that the subject was on numerous  
medications, several  of which  have  been associated  with SJS.  The subject  was treated  with ophthalmic,  
iv and oral steroids,  antihistamines,  anti-virals  and immunoglobulin.  As of Day 401, the event             
was reported  as resolving.  
 
Several  SAEs  have  been the  result of new onset  malignancies.  Two subjects  with Sézary  syndrome  in 
study  KW-0761 -001, both  from the  same  study  site, were  reported  to have  secondary  T-cell 
malignancies  that were  immunophenotypically  distinct  T-cell lymphomas,  i.e., gene  rearrangements  
different from their initial diagnoses. It is well known,  however,  that in patients  with CTCL, the presence  
of multiple T-cell clones, although  not common,  does  occur  with regularity.

 A male  subject  who was enrolled  as a healthy  volunteer and  received  0.001  mg/kg  of KW-0761  in 
Protocol  0761 -EU-001 developed  B-cell lymphoma  on study  Day 66. Following  study  participation,  
subject  presented  to primary physician  with swelling  on the right side  of his groin.  It was not routine  
policy  in this Phase  1 unit to include  assessment  of inguinal  lymph  nodes  on routine  physical  
examinations  and so  this was not assessed  at protocol  screening  visit. An independent   review  of the 
case by  expert  hematologists/oncologists  concluded  that given  the indolent  nature  of this disease  and 
its extensive  spread  in this subject, it was not likely  that it developed,  in this timescale, as a 
conseque nce of injection  of the study  drug.  The Investigator  later concurred,  noting  this was subclinical  
disease  not detected  at screening.  
5.7.3  Deaths  
 
There  have  been 11  deaths  reported  while  on study  in subjects  receiving  KW-0761 all of which  were  
considered  not related  to the study  drug.  The causes  of death  included  bronchopneumonia, disease  
progression,  pneumonia, and  septic  shock.  
 
5.8 Concomitant Medications  
 
During  the study  period, subjects  should  not receive  treatment with systemic  corticosteroids  or other  
immunosuppressive  agents  including  chemotherapy  unless  approved  by the principal  investigator.  
Topical and  inhaled  steroids  are permitted.  Treatment with antihistamines  and non-steroidal  anti- 
inflammatory drugs, including  COX -2 inhibitors,  are not recommended  but may be continued  or 
instituted  at the discretion  of the treating  physician  if necessary.  Investigator may prescribe  all other  
concomitant medications  or treatments  deemed  necessary to provide  adequate  subject  care. All  
prescription  and nonprescription  concomitant medications  must be recorded  in CRDB,  listing  generic  
name, indication,  dose  and schedule  and dates  of administration.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Potential research  subjects  will be identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment team,  the protocol  
investigator,  or research  team at Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  (MSKCC).  If the investigator  
is a member  of the treatment team, s/he  will screen  their patient’s  medical records  for suitable  research  
study  participants  and discuss  the study  and their potential  for enrolling  in the research  study.  Potential  
subjects  contacted  by their treating  physician  will be referred  to the investigator/research  staff of the 
study.  
 
The principal  investigator may also screen  the medical records  of patients  with whom  they do not have  
a treatment relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be eligible  to enroll in 
the study  and to record  appropriate  contact information  in order to approach  these  patients  regarding  
the possibility  of enrolling  in the study.  
 
During  the initial conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff and  the patient,  the patient may  
be asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary  to the recruitment  and enrollment  
process. The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical records  at MSKCC  in 
order  to further  assess  eligibility.  They  will use the information  provided  by the patient  and/or  medical  
record  to confirm that the patient is  eligible  and to contact the  patient regarding  study  enrollment. If the 
patient turns  out to be  ineligible  for the research  study,  the research  staff will destroy  all information  
collected  on the patient during  the initial conversation  and medical  records  review,  except for any 
information  that must be maintained  for screening  log purposes.

Page  34 of 63  
 In most  cases, the initial contact  with the prospective  subject  will be conducted either  by the treatment  
team,  investigator or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the treatment  team.  The recruitment  
process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal risk  to the privacy  of the patients  who are screened  
and minimal PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. For these  reasons,  we seek  a (partial)  
limited  waiver  of authorization  for the purposes  of (1) reviewing  medical  records  to identify  potential  
research  subjects  and obtain  information  relevant to the enrollment process;  (2) conversing  with 
patients  regarding  possible  enrollment; (3) handling  of PHI contained  within  those  records  and provided  
by the potential subjects; and  (4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of patients  approached  (if 
applicable).  
 
Before  being  enrolled, subjects  must  consent to participate  after the nature,  scope, and  possible  
consequences  of the study  have  been explained  in a form understandable  to them.  An informed  
consent for m will be prepared  and given  to the subject. This  document will contain  all the elements  
required  by FDA CFR Part 50 the ICH E6 Guideline  for GCP  and any additional elements  required  by 
local regulations.  The document  must  be in a language  understandable  to the subject.  Where  required  
by local law, the person  who informs  the subject  must  be a physician.  
 
After reading  the informed  consent  form and any other  IRB approved  subject -specific  study  information,  
and having  had ample  opportunity  for his questions  to be answered  by an adequately  trained  medical  
professional, the  subject  must  give consent in  writing  before  any study -specific  procedures  can 
commence.  The subject's  consent must  be confirmed  at the time of consent  by the personally  dated  
and timed  signature  of the subject.  
 
A copy  of the consent document and  any other  subject -specific  information  reviewed  as part  of the 
consent  process  must  be given  to the subject The original  signed  consent document will be retained  by 
the Investigator.  
 
If the subject is  unable  to read,  oral presentation  and explanation  of the patient  information  sheet  and 
the informed  consent form  and any information  to be supplied  to subjects  must  take place  in the 
presence of an impartial  witness.  Consent must  be confirmed  at the time of consent orally  and by the 
personally  dated  and timed  signature  of the subject  or by a local legally recognized  alternative  (e.g.,  the 
subject's  thumbprint  or mark). The witness  to the informed  consent  discussions  must  also sign and 
personally  date the consent  document.  
 
The Investigator  will not undertake  any measures  required  for the clinical study  until valid consent  has 
been  obtained.  
 
This protocol will take due notice  of NIH/ADAMHA  policies  concerning  inclusion  of women  and 
minorities  in clinical research  populations.  We expect  that the study  population  will be fully 
representative  of the range  of patients  referred  for treatment  without  exclusion  as to age, gender, or 
ethnic background. Pregnant  women  are excluded  from participation  in this study.  
 
This cost of this study  will be covered  by a combination  of funds  from Kyowa  Hakko  Kirin Pharma,  
grants  awarded  to the Co-Principal  Investigator,  and additional  funding  from the Ludwig  Institute  for 
Cancer  Research  at MSKCC.  
 
The anticipated  study  accrual  time is 2.5  years.

 8.1 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
Pre-treatment  evaluations  used  to determine  the subject’s  study  eligibility  must  be completed  within  30 
days  prior to the first dose  of KW-0761, except  as otherwise  specifically  noted  below.  Written  informed  
consent must  be obtained  prior to any study -specific  screening  evaluations  and before  subject  
enrollment.  
 
All subjects  must  undergo  the following  screening  evaluations:  
 
• medical history including  cancer history  and prior therapies,  as well as concomitant medical  
conditions  and medication  use 
• physical examination  (including  height [at  baseline  only] and weight measurements)  
• Karnofsky performance  status  
• vital signs  
• ECG  
• urine  pregnancy  test in women  of childbearing  potential  
• urinalysis  
• chemistry  profile  
• hematology  profile  
• coagulation  profile  
• flow cytometry  of lymphocyte  subsets  
• serum  cytokines  
• CMV  Ag and Ab 
• quantitative  immunoglobulins  
• HIV 
• hepatitis  panel  
• concomitant medication  assessment  and those  medications  taken  30 days  prior to the first dose  
of study  medication  
• chest, abdominal,  pelvic  CT or MRI scans  or PET/CT  (within  30 days  prior to the first dose  of 
KW-0761)  
 
Results  of all screening  evaluations  must  be reviewed  by the Principal  Investigator or his/her  designee  
to ensure  that all  eligibility  criteria  have  been  satisfied  prior to subject  treatment.  
9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
9.2 Dose  Schedule  
 
As shown  in Section  4.1, in  the first treatment course, KW -0761  will be administered  i.v. once  a week  
for four weeks (Cycle  1) and subsequently  every  2 weeks  for 4 weeks  (Cycle  2). Subsequent treatment  
courses  are permissible  for subjects  demonstrating  a response  or maintaining  stable  disease  and will 
consist  of an infusion  of KW-0761 every other  week.  Each  subsequent  course  (treatment course  2, 
treatment  course  3, etc.) will be defined  as completion  of two additional infusions  of KW-0761  over 4 
weeks. In the absence  of progression  or toxicity  subjects  may continue  treatment  up to 1 year.  If a 
subject  experiences  an overall  CR, the subject may  continue  on study  for up to  an additional  four 
infusions  beyond  CR, then  discontinue  treatment in  order to determine  duration  of response.  If a 
subject  experiences  a PR or SD, the subject may continue  therapy  after consultation  between  the

 Investigator and  the Principal  Investigator  until disease  progression  occurs  or other  withdrawal  criteria  
are met (refer to Section  4.8, Criteria for Study  Termination).  
 
Standard  3+3 cohorts  for safety  and DLT detection  will be utilized  (Table  1). Each  cohort will consist  of 
at least three  subjects. If DLT  is observed  in 0/3 subjects, escalation  to the next dose  level will occur. If  
DLT detected  in 1 of 3 subjects, then  three  more  subjects  will be added  at that dose  level.  If DLT is 
demonstrated  in an additional subject,  dose  escalation  will cease  (see Section  14 - Biostats  for a 
summary).  
 
Phase  II of the study  will enroll  a total of 48 subjects, 16 patients  in 3 tumor -specific  expansion  cohorts  
each  treated  with the MTD  (or highest dose  tested)  as determined  in Part 1 of the study.  The 3  tumor - 
specific  expansion  cohorts  will include  non-small  cell lung cancer, gastric  adenocarcinoma,  and triple - 
negative  (negative  for immunohistochemical expression  of the estrogen  receptor,  progesterone  
receptor, and  the Her2  protein) breast  adenocarcinoma.  
 
9.3 Toxicity  Definitions  
 
All AEs will be evaluated  and reported  according  to the NCI CTCAE  v.4.03.  For toxicity  grading  based  
on laboratory  tests, an abnormality  must be confirmed  (when  appropriate) by repeat testing.  
 
9.3.1  Dose  Limiting  Toxicity  
 
The occurrence  of the following  toxicities  will be considered  a DLT,  if judged  by the Investigator  to be 
possibly,  probably  or definitely  related  to study  drug administration:  
 
The definition  of DLT is any > Grade  3 hematologic  or non-hematologic  toxicity that  is related  to 
treatment.  
 
Exceptions : 
 
The following  are exceptions  to the definition  and will  be considered  a DLT if: 
 
• Grade  4 neutropenia  > 7 days  
• Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  
• Grade  3 thrombocytopenia  associated  with clinically  significant bleeding  
 
 
In the case  of Grade  2 immune  related  adverse  events  (irAE, defined  below)  study  drug administration  
will be delayed  until event  diminishes  to Grade  1 or less. 
 
Immune  related  Adverse  Events  
 
An irAE is defined  as a clinically  significant  adverse  event  of any organ  that is  associated with study  
drug exposure, of unknown  etiology,  and is consistent with an immune -mediated  mechanism.  
Serologic, immunologic, and  histologic  (biopsy)  data should  be used  to support  an irAE diagnosis.  
Appropriate  efforts  should  be made  to rule out neoplastic,  infectious,  metabolic,  toxin,  or other etiologic  
causes  of the irAE.

 Given  the intended  mechanism  of action  of KW-0761,  particular attention  will be given  to adverse  
events  that may follow  enhanced  T-cell activation  such as dermatitis  and colitis,  endocrinopathies, or 
other  irAEs.  
 
9.3.2  Infusion  Reactions: Grading  and Management  
 
Intravenous  administration  of biologic  agents  carries  a potential  risk of hypersensitivity reactions.  
Infusion  reactions  will be graded  according  to the National  Cancer Institute  (NCI)  Common  Terminology  
Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  4.03.  
 
Table  5 outlines  the infusion  reaction  grading  system,  associated  symptoms,  and the recommended  
actions  to be  taken  regarding  treatment. Reactions  occurring  within  24 hours  after the start of KW-0761  
infusion  will be considered  to be infusion  related  AEs. Premedication  with acetaminophen  650 mg orally  
and diphenhydramine  50 mg i.v.  or other  antihistamine  will be administered  to all subjects.  
 
As with all AEs, infusion -related  signs  or symptoms  which,  in the Investigator's  judgment,  are not 
related  to hypersensitivity  reactions  (e.g.,  dyspepsia,  urinary  frequency, etc.)  should  be recorded  and 
graded  as AEs according  to NCI CTCAE  v.4.03  criteria  in CRDB. Based  on nonclinical in  vitro and in 
vivo data,  KW-0761  administration  is not expected  to cause  cytokine  release  syndrome  (CRS).  
Although  there  is significant  overlap  in the clinical presentations  of anaphylaxis  and CRS  and either can 
occur  during  or within  2 hours  of completion  of infusion  of biologic  agents, some  symptoms,  such  as 
arthralgia  and chills,  are more  likely  to be due to CRS than anaphylaxis.  The NCI CTCAE  v.4.03  will be 
used  to grade  and report infusion  reactions  consistent with CRS.  
 
Stopping  Rules  will not apply to a specific  toxicity  if it is clearly  unrelated  to KW-0761 infusion  (e.g.,  
laceration, burn,  or similar  accidental trauma  unrelated  to some  other infusion -related  AE). 
 
Table  5: Infusion  Reaction  Grading  
 
Grade  Symptoms  Course  of Action  
1 Transient flushing  or rash,  drug 
fever  (≥38˚C)  No intervention  required  
2 Rash, flushing,  urticarial,  
dyspnea,  drug fever  (≥38˚C)  Decrease  the infusion  rate by 50% and 
proceed with dosing.  
 
3 Symptomatic  bronchospasm  and 
urticarial  with need  for parenteral  
medication(s), allergy -related  
edema/angioedema, hypotension  Stop infusion.  Give supplemental oxygen  and 
bronchodilators  as necessary.  Subject will not 
receive  any further  KW-071. 
 
 
4 Anaphylaxis  Stop infusion. Administer no further  KW-0761  
to subject. Contact  principal  investigator  
immediately. Investigator(s) review within  72 
hours.  Further actions  related  to study  
conduct  will be submitted  to IRB for approval  
before  initiation.  
 
 
5 Death  Contact principal  investigator  immediately.  
Further  cohort dosing  suspended.  
Investigator(s) review within  72 hours.  Further  
actions  will be submitted  to IRB for approval  
before  study  resumed.

 9.3.3  Treatment of Emergent  Skin  Rash  
 
In the event  a patient  develops  a treatment  emergent  skin rash, the following  measures  must  be taken  
to appropriately  document the event:  
 
Initial  Work -up of all skin rashes  (new  and re-challenge)  
 
1) Photograph  the rash.  
2) If the rash is ≥ Grade  2 or if the affected  area cannot  be differentiated  from a new  area of 
cutaneous  metastasis,  a biopsy  must  be performed.  Biopsy  the rash as well as an area 
of unaffected  skin in order  to compare  possible  drug eruption  to background  involved  
skin. 
3) Confer  with Principal  Investigator after completion  of one week  of treatment  with topical  
corticosteroids  to assess  response  to treatment.  
4) Forward  all results  to the Principal  Investigator  and discuss  a treatment  plan with 
medical  follow  up. 
5) Biopsy  should  be read by the dermatopathologist at the study  center.  
Rash  Treatment Guidelines  (after  initial work -up): 
Grade  1 rash (drug  related  or non-drug related)  
 
1) Treatment with study  drug may continue.  
2) Treat rash with topical corticosteroids  as needed.  
Grade  2 or above rash (drug  related)  
1) Treatment with study  drug must  be stopped.  
2) Treat rash with 2-week  course  of topical corticosteroids.  
3) After 2 -week  course, re -assess  rash per the steps  outlined  in initial assessment;  if 
resolved  completely  or to Grade  1, study  drug treatment may be resumed. If  not 
resolved,  contact  the Principal  Investigator  for further discussion.  
4) Subjects with Grade  3 or 4 rash will not receive  any further  KW-0761.  
 
Grade  2 or above  rash on re-challenge  
1) If rash recurs  and becomes  a Grade  3, the patient must  be discontinued  from the trial 
and the rash work  up above  must  be completed.  
2) If the rash recurs at a Grade  2, follow  the steps  above  for Grade  2 Rash.  
3) If the rash recurs at Grade  2 or higher  for a third time, the rash work  up must  be 
performed  and the patient  must  be discontinued  from the trial. 
 
4) Subjects with Grade  3 or 4 rash will not receive  any further  KW-0761.  
 
 
9.3 Assessment  of Safety  
 
Safety  is a primary  endpoint for this study.  Safety will be evaluated  for all treated  subjects  using  
National  Cancer Institute  (NCI)  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  v4.03 (CTCAE).  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 14-135 A(8) 
Amended:  17-AUG -2016  
Page  39 of 63  
 Safety  assessments  will be based  on medical review  of adverse  event reports  and the results  of vital 
sign measurements,  physical examinations,  and clinical laboratory tests.  The incidence  of observed  
adverse  events  will be tabulated  and reviewed  for potential significance  and clinical importance.  The 
reporting  period  for safety  data will be from the time following  the subje ct’s written  consent to participate  
in the study  until 90 days  after the last dose.  The timing  of all Safety assessments, including  AE 
reporting  and laboratory  assessments,  is shown  in the  Schedule  of Assessments,  Table  2. 
 
9.4 Serious  and Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
9.4.1  Definition  of Adverse  Events  
 
An AE is any untoward  medical event  that occurs  in a subject  who has received  an investigational  
product,  and does  not necessarily  need  to have  a causal relationship  with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding), symptom,  
or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of an investigational  product, whether  or not related  to 
the product.  
 
All AEs will be evaluated  and reported  according  to the NCI CTCAE  v.4.03.  
 
9.4.2  Treatment Emergent  Adverse  Event  
 
A treatment -emergent adverse  event  (TEAE) is  an AE that begins  or that worsens  in severity  after the  
start of the first exposure  to KW-0761. Only  TEAEs  will be recorded  in CRDB.  For the purposes  of this 
study,  the terms  "AE" and "TEAE" may be used  interchangeably.  Adverse  events  that occur during  the 
Screening  and Baseline  periods  are not treatment  emergent  and will be recorded  in the subject's  
medical records, but not in CRDB.  
 
An illness  present  at study entry  is considered  a pre-existing  condition, not an AE. Pre-existing  
conditions  will be recorded  in CRDB. If  a subject experiences  clinically  relevant  worsening  of a pre- 
existing  condition  after any KW-0761  has been  administered, this  will be considered  an AE. 
 
Signs  and symptoms  present  at baseline  will be documented  as pre-existing  symptoms  in CRDB.  
 
9.4.3  Serious  Adverse  Event  
 
An SAE is any untoward  medical occurrence  that: 
 
1. Results  in death,  
 
2. Is life-threatening,A 
 
3. Requires  in-patient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization,  
 
4. Results  in persistent  or significant disability  or incapacity,  
 
5. Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect,  and/or  
 
6. Is another  medically  important  conditionB 
 
A. The term "life -threatening" in  the definition  of "serious" refers  to an event in  which  the subject is  at 
risk of death  at the time of the event; it does  not refer to an event, which  hypothetically  might  have  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 14-135 A(8) 
Amended:  17-AUG -2016  
Page  40 of 63  
 caused  death  if it were  more  severe. The term "severe"  is often  used  to describe  the intensity  (severity)  
of an event  (such  as: mild, moderate, or severe,  e.g., pain). The event  itself may be of relatively  minor  
medical  significance  (such  as severe  headache). This  is not the same  as "serious",  which  is based  on 
subject/event  outcome  or action  criteria  usually associated  with events  that pose  a threat to the 
subject's  life or vital functions.  Seriousness  (not severity)  serves  as a guide  for defining  regulatory  
reporting  obligations.  
 
B. Medically  important conditions  that may not result  in death, but may be immediately  life-threatening  
or require  hospitalization  may be considered  as SAE when,  based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the subject  or may require  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in the 
definition  above.  Examples  of such  events  are intensive  treatment in  an emergency  room or at home  for 
allergic  bronchospasm; blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in hospitalization;  or 
development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
 
Reporting  requirements  for SAEs  are described  in Section  9.4. 
 
9.4.4  Relationship to KW-0761  
 
The relationship  of all AEs to KW-0761  will be determined  by the Investigator on the basis  of clinical  
judgment, using  one of the following  terms  (in accordance  with NCI Guideline  "Expedited  Adverse  
Event  Reporting  Requirements  for NCI Investigational Agents",  NCI Cancer Therapy  Evaluation  
Program, January 2001):  
 
Definitely  related (The AE is clearly  related  to the investigational  agent)  
Probably  related  (The AE is likely  related  to the investigational  agent)  
Possibly  related  (The AE may be related  to the investigational  agent)  
Unlikely  related  (The AE is doubtfully  related  to the investigational  agent)  
Unrelated  (The AE is clearly  not related  to the investigational agent)  
N.B.:  When  making  the assessment  of causality,  it should  be taken  into consideration  that 
immunomodulatory  agents  have  the potential  to cause late and/or  permanent  effects  on the immune  
system,  i.e., a causal  relationship  could  exist despite  a lack of apparent temporal  relationship.  
Information  provided  in the IB and/or  in this protocol may support  these  evaluations.  
 
 
 
9.5 Safety  Criteria  for Advancement,  Adjustment,  or Stopping  Dosing  Within  a Cohort  
 
This is safety  and tolerability  study.  Safety  monitoring  will be conducted  by the Principal  Investigator.  
Subjects will be monitored  at the  investigative  site according  to the schedule  of assessments  outlined  in 
Table  2. Additional  assessments  to evaluate  and/or treat  any AEs may be performed  at the discretion  of 
the Principal  Investigator.  In the event that  a subject  will need  to undergo  palliative  surgery  or radiation,  
the schedule  of dosing  and assessments  will be modified  to allow  for the treatment to be administered.  
The adjustments  will be made  in coordination  with the Principal  Investigator  and the subject’s  
physicians.

 9.5.1  Dose  Limiting  Toxicity  
 
Patients  in each  cohort  must  complete the first 4 weeks  of study  therapy  prior to enrollment of 
subsequent cohorts.  For the purpose  of determining  the MTD,  the timeframe  for evaluating  patients for 
DLT will be within  4 weeks  of study  therapy.  All adverse  reactions  should  be considered  relevant to  
determining  dose  limiting  toxicity  and to reporting, unless  the event can clearly  be determined  to be  
unrelated  to the drug.  Sites  must notify  the Principal  Investigator  within  24 hours of having  knowledge  
of DLT.  All investigators  in the study  will be notified  of any DLTs  at each  dose  level before  dose  
escalation.  
 
Subjects experiencing  a DLT during  any course  of treatment should  receive  no further  administration  of 
KW-0761. However,  subjects  exhibiting  clinical benefit  and who experience  DLT may be eligible  for 
further admin istration  of KW-0761 on  a case by  case  basis  following  discussion  with the Principal  
Investigator.  
 
A dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT) will be defined  as any toxicity  that does  not have  a clear -cut alternative  
explanation.  Any of the following,  specified  below,  will be considered  a DLT:  
 
• >Grade  3 non-hematologic  toxicity  
• >Grade  3 hematologic  toxicity  
• >Grade  3 allergic  reaction/hypersensitivity  reaction  (including  drug fever)  
• >Grade  3 cytokine  release  syndrome/acute  infusion  reaction  
 
9.5.2  Exceptions  to Dose  Limiting  Toxicity  
 
The following  are exceptions  to the definition  and will  be considered  a DLT if: 
 
• Grade  4 neutropenia  > 7 days  
• Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  
• Grade  3 thrombocytopenia  associated  with clinically  significant bleeding  
 
 
 
Patients  who enter the trial with Grade 2  elevation  of liver enzymes  due to hepatic  
involvement  by malignancy  must  have  an increase  in hepatic  enzymes  to Grade  3 that persists  for at 
least  7 days  for this toxicity  to represent  a DLT.  
 
 
9.5.3  Definition  of Maximum  Tolerated  Dose  (MTD)  and definition  of Maximal Dose  Level  
 
The MTD  is defined  as the dose  below  that dose  at which  at least 2 of up to 6 subjects  in a dosing  
cohort  experience  DLT.  The MTD  will be determined  during  Phase  1. In the absence  of MTD,  the 
maximal dose  level is  the highest  dose  evaluated  in this study  without  evidence  of DLT.  
9.6 Dose  Escalation  
 
Toxicity  data for each  cohort will be reviewed  prior to dose  escalation. The dose  for the first cohort  will 
be 0.5 mg/kg. In the absence  of a DLT,  dose  will be escalated  as indicated  in the  cohorts  listed  in Table  
1. Dose  escalation  will cease  when  at least one of the following  endpoints  is reached:  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 14-135 A(8) 
Page  42 of 63  
 • The MTD  is exceeded; Or  
• A cohort  of at least 3 subjects  has been  dosed  with 10 mg/kg  KW-0761  
 
Dose  escalation  will be based  on at least three evaluable  subjects  receiving four  complete  infusions  of 
KW-0761.  
 
9.7 Cohort  Size and Stopping  Rules  
 
See Table  6 for a summary.  
 
Table  6. Determination  of DLT and MTD  
 
 
 
9.8 Replacement of Subjects  
 
During  the dose  escalation  phase of this study  subjects  who do not complete the first four infusions  for 
reasons  other than  a DLT will be replaced.  
9.9 Phase  II – Preliminary  Assessment  of Efficacy  and Further  Assessment of Safety  
 
After determination  of the MTD  or maximal dose  level if  MTD  is not exceeded,  additional  subjects  will 
then be enrolled  and treated  at that dose if feasible,  or a lower  dose  if not feasible  in three  disease  
specific  cohorts.  Fourty -eight  subjects, are to be treated  with the dose  determined  from the initial  
portion  of the study.  
 
If during  Phase  I/II portion  of the study  compelling  evidence  collects  of response  in a particular tumor  
type the protocol may be amended  to include  an expansion  cohort.  
 
There  will be no dose  reductions  allowed  during  the Phase  II portion  of the study.

 9.11 Pharmacodynamic  Assessments  
 
Pharmacodynamic  assessments  will be performed  on all patients  in this study.  Available  research  blood  
and tumor samples  will be delivered  to the Immune  Monitoring  Facility  (IMF) for processing  and 
cryopreservation.   Available  stool samples  will be similarly  brought to the Molecular  Microbiology  Core  
Facility.  Subjects will bring  in samples  when  feasible.   It is understood  that the bowel habits  of subjects  
will vary widely  and as such it is likely  that not all collections  are possible,  if this is the case subjects  will 
be allowed  to continue  on study.  
 
If a site  of tumor  is readily  available  as a cutaneous  lesion  a simple  punch  or excisional biopsy  under  
local anesthesia  can be performed  by the co-principal  investigator or qualified  personnel. If  tumor is as 
readily  accessible  then an image -guided  core needle  biopsy  will be obtained  following  consultation  with 
the radiology  staff to determine  the overall  risk of the procedure. Invasive  procedures  that require  
general anesthesia  should  not be performed  to obtain  a biopsy  specimen. If  a surgical procedure  is 
performed  for a clinical indication  a sample  may be used  for research  purposes.  During  the course  of 
treatment  a decision  may be made  to perform the  post-treatment biopsy  earlier  than 15 days  if there  is 
evidence  to suggest  a possibility that by day 15 there  will be no available  tumor  for biopsy  due to a 
rapid  clinical response.  Similarly the biopsy  may be performed  later than  15 days  if there is evidence  to 
suggest  a delayed  response.  
 
Tumor tissue  obtained  from biopsies  will be divided  equally  for fresh  frozen  paraffin  embedding  and 
cryopreservation  by the IMF. 
9.11.1  CCR4+ T cell depletion  
The degree  of depletion  of CCR4+ T cells by KW-0761  will be determined  by flow cytometry. The 
proportion of CCR4+ T cells to other  T cell subsets  as well as the  concentration  in a fixed  volume  of 
blood  will expressed  in relation  to base  line levels  as well as time.  
 
9.11.2  Serum  Biomarkers  
 
Pre-treatment  and on-treatment  serum  levels  of chemokines, cytokines, and  tumor -associated  soluble  
proteins  will be assessed  by techniques  that may include  but are not limited  to, ELISA  or multiplex  
assays.  Analytes  may include  markers of inflammation, imm une activation,  host tumor  growth  factors,  
and tumor -derived  proteins. These  assays  will take place  in the Immune  Monitoring  Facility  (IMF)  and a 
messenger  will bring  the samples  to the IMF from the ITC. The  sample  will need  to arrive  to the ITC 
within  6 hours of blood  draw.  
 
Serologic  assays  using  multiplexed  ELISA  to determine  antibody  titers  to tumor -associated  antigens  will 
also be performed  by the IMF. Theses  assays  are used  to estimate  the titer of antibodies  specific  to one 
or more  tumor -associated  antigens,  including  but not limited  to cancer -testis  (CT) antigens  such  as NY-
ESO -1, in human  serum  or plasma  samples. Monitoring  of potential changes  in particular tumor  
antigen -specific  antibody  responses  during  the course  of cancer immu notherapy  may predict response  
or provide  further  understanding  of the mechanism  of action  of KW-0761.  
 
9.11.3  Immunophenotyping  
 
Immunophenotyping  will be determined  using  flow cytometry  to determine  the effect on individual  
lymphocyte  subsets  in peripheral blood  mononuclear  cells (PBMC)  and in tumor  if sufficient tumor

 tissue is  present. Flow  cytometric  assessment  of the lymphocyte subsets  CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+ 
and CD56+  will be examined  as percent  and absolute  number. FOXP3+ and FOXP3- lymphocytes  with 
the following  markers  will also include  but not limited  to: CD4+, CD25,  CD45RA,  CD45RO, LAG3,  
GARP,  PD1, and  CTLA4.  Activation  markers  such  as CD44  and CD69,  will also be examined.  These  
assays  will take place  in the Immune  Monitoring  Facility (IMF).  
 
In order to determine  if the depletion  of Treg cells has an effect  on pre-existing  immunity  to multiple  
non-tumor antigens,  PBMC  will be analyzed  with a panel  of HLA tetramers  to common  antigens  
including  those  used  in routine  vaccinations. This  will be done  in collaboration  with Dr. Ton 
Schumacher of the Netherlands  Cancer Institute  who has developed  and validated  the panel  of HLA- 
Tetramers. In order  to choose  tetramers  that are specific  to the individual  patients  HLA,  a sample  of 
PBMCs  will undergo  HLA typing  by the New York Blood  Center.  The samples  that will be sent to The 
New York Blood  Center  as well as to Dr. Schumacher’s  group  will be de-identified  to ensure  that 
privacy  will be maintained.  
 
Phenotypic  analysis  of TILs by immunohistochemistry  will be performed  to identify  and characterize  
tumor  infiltrating  immune  cells.  We will also assess tumor cell  apoptosis, hypoxia,  vascularization,  and 
proliferative  activity  as described.  These  assays  will be performed  by MSKCC  tumor  pathology  core,  
where  tumor  hypoxia,  apoptosis, and  proliferation  indices  are analyzed  in a standardized  manner by 
MSKCC  Molecular  Cytology  facility.  The tumor tissue  will be accessioned  and stored by  the IMF until 
analysis.  
 
Archival tumor  biopsy  material  if present  may be examined  for biomarkers of interest and/or  infiltrating  
immune  cells and their presence  or absence  correlated  with observed  clinical  outcomes.  If such  an 
analysis  is planned  a separate  tissue  procurement  protocol  will be submitted  for review.  
9.11.4  Cellular  Assays  
 
To explore  if KW-0761  has an effect on the function  of T cells assays  that determine  the production  of 
effector molecules  including  but not limited  to IFN-g and  Granzyme  B will be assessed  by flow 
cytometry  in response  to non-specific  or antigen  specific  restimulation.  Examples  of antigen  specific  
stimulation  include  the use of either  tumor  specific  antigens  or commonly  exposed  antigens  such  as 
influenza  proteins. These  assays  will be performed  on cryopreserved  PBMC  in the IMF. 
 
The IMF may also perform  ELISPOT, flow tetramer  staining,  and/or intracellular  polyfunctional cytokine  
staining, TCR  Vβ Repertoire  analysis  and Spectratyping  to further characterize  tumor -antigen  specific  
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response  before  and after treatment.  PBMCs  and TILs from relevant tissue  will 
be archived  for all patients  to support  complete  analysis  of the profile.  
 
9.11.5  Gene  Expression  Profiling  
 
Analysis  of the transcriptome  of PBMC  or tumor tissue  may provide  further  understanding  of the 
mechanism of action  of KW-0761. Cryopreserved  PBMC  and tumor  tissue  will submitted  to the 
Integrated  Genomics  Core  Facility  for RNA extraction,  SMARTer  amplification,  and mRNA  sequencing  
on the  HiSeq  sequencing  platform.  Analysis  of the data will be performed  with the assistance  of the 
bioinformatics  core facility.  Further  analysis  of gene  expression  may be performed  with quantitative  
real-time polymerase  chain  reaction  (qPCR) or additional multiplexed  gene  expression  assays  to detect  
expression  of selected  immune -related  genes.

 9.11.6  Stool Microbial  Composition  and Metabolite  Analysis  
 
The composition  of the stool  microbiota modulates  the activity  of the immune  system  through  the 
production  of various  bioactive  metabolites.  Modulation  of the immune  system  by KW-0761  may alter 
the composition  of the stool  microbiota  that can lead to adverse  events  such  as colitis.  Thus,  we will 
collect fecal  samples  from patients  prior to, and after treatment  and assess  changes  in composition  of 
microbial community  using  16S RNA sequencing  and metagenomic  analysis  as a correlate  for intestinal  
inflammation  as a result of Treg cell depletion.  Analysis  of various  bacterial metabolites  including  but 
not limited  to short -chained  fatty acids  will also be performed  by nuclear magnetic  resonance  or 
chromatography. Subjects  at home  will collect  the stool  samples  with the use of a stool  collection  kit. 
The kit will include  detailed  instructions  on collection,  handling,  and transport  of the sample.  When  the 
sample  is brought to the ITC, it will be refrigerated  and sent to the Molecular  Microbiology  Core  Facility  
by a messenger.  The sample  should  arrive  at the  core facility  within  12 hours  of arrival at the ITC. The 
sample  should  be collected  by the patient within  24 hours of arrival to the  ITC. 
 
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
10.1 Treatment  course  Evaluations  
 
A series  of clinical tests  and procedures  will be performed  at different  intervals  throughout  the study  
(Table  2). 
 
Evaluations  to be performed  periodically during  the study  include:  
 
• Physical  examination  
• Karnofsky PS  
• Vital signs  
• ECG  
• Urinalysis  
• Chemistry profile  
• Hematology profile  
• Coagulation  profile  
• Flow  cytometry  of peripheral  blood  lymphocytes  
• AE assessment  
• Concomitant  medication  assessment  
• Cross -sectional imaging  (Chest,  abdominal,  pelvic  CT or MRI scans,  or PET/CT)  
• Assessment  of tumor response  (AJCC,  TNM  and irRC)  
 
 
 
10.2 Disease  Monitoring  Criteria  
 
Disease stage  will be assessed  by the AJCC  TNM  Clinical Staging  107. Clinical  stage  from medical  
history will be documented  from medical  records  during  Screening  (Inclusion/Exclusion  Review).  
Clinical staging  will be assessed  by review  of medical records, review  of pathologic  staging  of the most  
recent lymph  node  biopsies,  and imaging  for evaluation  of metastases  within  30 days  of KW-0761

 dosing  and at Day 15 of Cycle  2. Clinical staging  will be documented  at Baseline/Screening  and 
repeated  and documented  at Day 15 of Cycle  2. When  possible, tumor progression  will be assessed  
according  to irRC  at Baseline,  Day 15 of Cycle  2 and every 2 cycles  thereafter, and  as data are 
available and/or  clinically  indicated - during  Long -term Follow -up 108,109. 
The irRC criteria  allow  for continued  treatment  beyond  progression of disease  (in order to confirm  
response).  Treatment beyond  what  would  be considered  progression  of disease  using  RECIST  1.1 
criteria  will be permitted  if the following  criteria  are met: 
 
• Investigator -assessed  clinical  benefit,  and do not have  rapid  disease  progression  
 
• Continue  to meet all  other  study  protocol eligibility  criteria  
 
• Tolerance  of study  drug 
 
• Stable  performance  status  
 
• Treatment  beyond  progression  will not delay  an imminent intervention  to prevent  serious  
complications  of disease  progression  (e.g. CNS metastases)  
 
 
10.3 Discontinuation  of Study  Therapy  
 
In accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki, ICH Good  clinical Practice  Guidelines,  and the US FDA 
Regulations, a research  subject  has the right to withdraw  at any time for any reason without  prejudice  
to future  medical care.  Further  criteria  for removal  from the study  are described  in Section  13. In the 
absence  of a medical contraindication  or significant  protocol  violation,  every  effort  will be made  by the 
Principal  Investigator to keep  the subject in  the study;  however,  should  the subject decide  to 
discontinue  treatment, all  efforts  will be made  to complete  and report  the observations  as thoroughly  as 
possible,  including  a complete final  evaluation  at the time of the subject's  withdrawal  with an 
explanation  of why the subject  is withdrawing  from the study.  If the subject  is agreeable  they will be 
eligible  for short term and long term follow  up at listed  in Table  2 regardless  of duration  of treatment. If  
the subject  declines  consent for final assessments  these  will not be done  and a note will be recorded  in 
CRDB . 
 
10.4 4 Post -therapy  Monitoring  
 
The Investigator  can elect to conduct additional tests  and/or  follow -up visits  in clinic  during  the post- 
therapy  monitoring  period  as needed  to evaluate  and/or treat any  adverse  event  (AEs).  
 
Subjects will return  for assessments  at weeks  2, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 following  the last dose  (Figure  6). 
Telephonic  assessments  or medical  record  reviews  will occur  at Months  6, 12, 18, and 24 after last 
dose  is administered. The  Investigator  can elect to  conduct additional  tests and/or follow -up visits  in 
clinic  during  this period  as needed  to evaluate  and/or treat any  adverse  event (AEs).  
 
10.4.1  Short -Term  Follow -Up (STFU)

Page  47 of 63  
 Following  the end of treatment  or treatment completion  date,  a 24-week  short  term follow -up (STFU)  
period  of observation  will begin.  Patients  will be seen  at weeks  2,3,6,12,18,  and 24 following  the last 
dose  during  which  the following  evaluations  will take place  (see Table  2): 
 
• Karnofsky Performance  Status  (every visit) 
 
• Physical Examination  (every visit)  
 
• Vital Signs (every visit) 
 
• CBC  (weeks  12, 24) 
 
• Stool  analysis  (Weeks  3, 12, 24)  
 
• Flow  Cytometry  and Serum  Cytokines  (Weeks  3, 12, 18, 24) 
• Tumor Imaging  (Week  18) 
10.4.2  Long -Term  Follow-Up (LTFU)  
 
Telephone  assessments  or medical record  reviews  will occur  at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months  after the end 
of the Short -term follow  up period (Table  2), the end of treatment date  or treatment  completion  date.  
Vital status  and any new therapies  started  will be determined.  
 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
As with all therapeutic  proteins, there  is a potential  for immunogenicity.  Subjects  will be monitored  for 
autoimmune  syndrome  development,  including  but not limited  to colitis, dermatitis, thyroiditis  and 
uveitis.  Subjects  administered  KW-0761  may be at risk of developing  an infection,  as KW-0761  may 
affect  host defenses.  The impact  of treatment  with KW-0761  on the development and  course  of active  
and/or chronic  infections  is not fully  understood, therefore, subjects  developing  an infection  during  
treatment  with KW-0761  should  be monitored  closely.  Subjects should  be monitored  for tumor lysis 
syndrome, a metabolic  oncologic  emergency  associated  with hematologic  malignancies  that presents  
as severe  electrolyte  abnormalities.  Signs  and symptoms  include  azotemia,  acidosis,  
hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia,  hypocalcemia,  and acute  renal  failure.  Treatment of tumor  lysis 
syndrome  includes  in-subject  monitoring, vigorous  fluid resuscitation,  and allopurinol  or urate  oxidase  
therapy  to lower  uric acid levels,  urinary alkalinization,  and hemodialysis.  
 
Subjects experiencing  Grade  4 neutropenia  should  have  a white  blood  cell count done  every  other day  
until absolute  neutrophil  count (ANC)  is above  1,000  cells/ μl. If the Grade  4 neutropenia  persists  for > 7 
days,  this is a DLT and subject  must  be removed  from study.  Administration  of G-CSF and/or other  
appropriate  supportive  care measures  shoul d be considered.  
 
Additional information  about  potential  toxicities  can be  found  in section  9.2. 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
12.1 Disease  Progression  Monitoring  Criteria  
 
Disease stage  will be assessed  by the AJCC  TNM  Clinical Staging  107. Clinical  stage  from medical  
history will be documented  from medical  records  during  Screening  (Inclusion/Exclusion  Review).  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 14-135 A(8) 
Amended:  17-AUG -2016  
Page  48 of 63  
 Clinical staging  will be assessed  by review  of medical records,  review  of pathologic  staging  of the most  
recent lymph  node  biopsies,  and imaging  for evaluation  of metastases  within  30 days  of KW-0761  
dosing  at Week  8, and every  eight  weeks  thereafter. Clinical staging  will be documented  at 
Baseline/Screening  and repeated  and documented  at Day 15 of Cycle  2, and every  2 cycles  thereafter.  
When  possible, tumor progression  will be assessed  according  to irRC at Baseline,  at Day 15 of Cycle  2, 
and every 2 cycles  thereafter, and  as data are availa ble and/or  clinically  indicated - during  Long -term 
Follow -up 108,109. See Appendix  I for detailed monitoring criteria.  
If possible  a tumor biopsy  will be obtained  at Baseline  and at Day 15 (+/- 4 days)  from all subjects.  
Qualified  personnel  trained  in the  procedure  will take the tumor biopsy. If a site  of tumor is  readily  
available  as a cutaneous  lesion  a simple  punch  or excisional  biopsy  under  local anesthesia  can be 
performed  by the principal  investigatory  or qualified  personnel.  If tumor is not readily  accessible  then an 
image -guided  core needle  biopsy  will be obtained  following  consultation  with the radiology  staff to  
determine  the overall  risk of the procedure. Invasive  procedures  that require  general anesthesia  should  
not be performed  to obtain  a biopsy  specimen.  If a surgical procedure  is performed  for a clinical  
indication  a sample  may be used  for research  purposes.  During  the course  of treatment a decision  may 
be made  to perform the post-treatment  biopsy  earlier  than 15 days  if there  is evidence  to suggest a 
possibility  that by day 15 there  will be no available  tumor  for biopsy  due to a rapid  clinical response.  
Similarly  tumor  biopsy  may be delayed  if there  is evidence  of a delayed  response.  
 
From  the biopsy  specimens,  immune  cell subsets  including  dendritic  cells, T and  B lymphocytes  will be 
evaluated  by IHC and flow cytometry  for morphology,  activation,  and maturation  status.  Isolation  of 
individual  populations  of lymphocytes  or tumor  cells may be performed  for gene  expression analysis  
and DNA/RNA  sequencing.  Additional correlative  exploratory immunologic  studies  including,  but not 
limited  to, enumerating  and characterizing  circulating  cytokines,  immu ne cells,  and tumor  cells will be 
performed.  
 
 
13.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
In accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki, ICH Good  Clinical Practice  Guidelines,  and the US FDA 
Regulations, a research  subject  has the right to withdraw  at any time for any reason  without  prejudice  to 
future  medical care.  The investigators  also have  the right to withdraw  subjects. Should  a subject (or 
legally  authorized  representative)  decide  to withdraw,  all efforts  will be made  to complete  and report the 
observations  as thoroughly  as possible.  
 
A complete  final evaluation  should  be made  at the time of withdrawal  with an explanation  of why the 
subject  is withdrawing.  An attempt should  be made  to perform  a follow -up study  visit at the  time of 
withdrawal.  This discussion  will be documented  in the EMR.  
 
Subjects  may be removed  from study  if one or more  of the following  occur:  
 
• Significant protocol  violation  by the Investigator.  
• Significant subject noncompliance.  
• Refusal of the subject to continue  treatment  or observations.  
• Disease  recurrence  or progression  that prevents  further  participation.  
• Investigator decides  that termination  is in the subject's  best medical interest.  
• Lost to follow -up.

IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 14-135 A(8) 
Amended:  17-AUG -2016  
Page  49 of 63  
 With the consent of the subject or the legally authorized  representative  the Investigator may determine  
that limited  data collection  may be continued  (e.g., through  medical  record  review)  for the duration  of 
the study  after a subject has  withdrawn.  
 
Subjects who do not complete the study  for reasons  other than  dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  will be 
replaced  at the discretion  of the Principal  Investigator.  In an  effort to have  a sufficient number of 
patients  to evaluate  saphety in  the Phase  I portion  of the trial and  to obtain  16 evaluable  patients  per 
tumor  specific  cohort in  the Phase  II portions  replacement of such  patients  will also occur.  Inevaluable  
patients  will be reported.  All subjects  will be included  in the analysis  of results.  
14.1 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
Categ orical variables  will be summarized  using  counts  and percentages,  while  continuous  variables  will 
be summarized  using  the mean, median, standard  deviation,  minimum,  maximum,  and number  of 
observations.  All summaries  will be presented by  cohort.  Any statistical  testing  performed  will be two- 
tailed  at the 5% significance  level.  A detailed  description  of statistical analyses  will be presented  in a 
Statistical Analysis  Plan,  which  will be completed  and approved  by the PI before  the database  is  
locked.  
 
This phase  I/II trial to determine  the maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  of mogamulizumab  (KW-0761)  in 
patients  with advanced  and/or  metastatic  solid tumors.  A standard  3+3  design  will be utilized  to 
determine  the MTD.  Four dose  levels  of KW-0761  will be investigated  (0.5mg/kg,  1mg/kg,  3mg/kg,  
10mg/kg).  Patients  will be treated  in cohorts  of size three  to six and the dosage  will be escalated  if the 
clinical toxicity  is acceptable.  Toxicity  severity will  be graded according  to the CTCAE  (ver. 4.03).  
 
A dose -limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  will be defined  as any toxicity  that does  not have  a clear -cut alternative  
explanation.  Any of the following,  specified  below,  will be considered  a DLT:  
> Grade  3 non-hematologic  toxicity  
> Grade  3 hematologic  toxicity  
> Grade  3 allergic  reaction/hypersensitivity  reaction  (including  drug fever)  
> Grade  3 cytokine  release  syndrome/acute  infusion  reaction  
 
The following  are exceptions  to Dose -Limiting  Toxicity  
For neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia, the following  criteria  must be met to be considered  a DLT:  
 
Grade  4 neutropenia  lasting  >7 days  
Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  
Grade  3 thrombocytopenia  with bleeding  
 
Patients  who enter  the trial with Grade  2 elevation  of liver enzymes  due to hepatic  involvement  by 
malignancy  must  have  an increase  in hepatic  enzymes  to Grade  3 that persists  for at least 7 days  for 
this toxicity  to represent  a DLT.  
 
The design  is constructed  to reduce  the chance  of escalating  the dose  when  the probability  of DLT is 
high,  and increase  the chance  of escalating  the dose  when  the probability  of DLT is low. The maximum  
tolerated  dose  (MTD)  is defined  as the highest  dose  level where  a DLT occurs  within  at most  one out of 
six patients  treated.  The escalation  scheme  is as follows:  
 
(1) If none  of the initial  three  patients  in a cohort  experiences  a DLT,  then a new cohort  of three  
patients  will be treated  at the next higher dose  level.  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 14-135 A(8) 
Amended:  17-AUG -2016  
Page  50 of 63  
 (2) If one of the three  patients  in a cohort  experiences  a DLT,  then up to three  additional  
patients  will be treated  at the same  dose.  Escalation  will continue  if only one of the six patients  
experiences  DLT.  
 
(3) If two or more  patients  in a cohort  experience  DLT,  then the MTD  will have  been  exceeded,  
and no further dose  escalation  will occur.  The previous  dose  level will be considered  the MTD.  
 
(4) If only three  patients  were  treated  at a dose  level under  consideration  as the MTD,  then up 
to three  additional  patients  will be accrued.  If no more  than one of the six patients  at that dose  
level experience  a DLT,  then that dose  level will be confirmed  as the MTD.  If two or more  
patients  in that cohort  experience  DLT,  then the previous  dose  level will be studied  in the same  
fashion.  
 
The MTD  is defined  as the highest  dose  studied  for which  the observed  incidence  of DLT is less than 
33%.   Frequencies  of toxicities  will be tabulated  according  to the NCI Common  Toxicity  Criteria.  
 
Table  7 below  gives  the probabilities  of dose  escalation  based on  true DLT risk in the 3+3 design.

Phase  II portion:  Additional  patients  will be accrued  to the disease  specific  expansion  cohorts  at the 
MTD  for evaluation  of safety,  tolerability,  pharmacodynamics,  and activity  potential  in the Phase  II 
portion.  The diseases  included  in these  cohorts  include  triple -negative  breast  carcinoma,  non-small  cell 
lung carcinoma,  and gastric  adenocarcinoma  for which  there  will be cohort  sizes  of 16 subjects  for a 
total of 48 subjects  in the Phase  II portion.  The primary  activity  parameter  is disease  response,  as 
measured  by irRC at 6 months  from the initiation  of therapy  in the phase  II portion  of the expansion  
cohorts.  It is assumed  that none  of the subjects  would  have  a response  if they had not received  any 
therapy  and the response  rate (RR)  for subjects  treated  with KW-0761  would  be 10%.  A one-sample  
exact  binomial  test will be used  in testing  the alternative  hypothesis  Ha: RR with treatment = 10% against  the 
null hypothesis  H0: RR without  treatment = 0.1%.  A sample  size of 16 evaluable  subjects  is required  to provide  
more  than 80% power  in a one-sample  exact  Binomial  test at the significance  level of 0.05.  If one 
response  is observed  out of 16 patients  in a particular  cohort  then the treatment  will be considered  
worthy  of further  study  in that cohort.  
 
The 10% response  rate was chosen  based  on the response  rates  observed  with ipilimumab,  arguably  
the most  successful  and best-studied  immunotherapy  in current  clinical  use, whose  mechanism  of 
action  is mediated  at least in part through  Treg cell depletion  110. The Phase  II study  of ipilimumab  
showed  a best overall  response  rate of 11.1%  in heavily  pretreated  melanoma  patients  111. The best 
overall  response  rate of 10.9%  in the Phase  III clinical  trial of ipilimumab  in patients  with metastatic  
melanoma  which  translated  to an improved overall  survival  34. 
 
Overall  and progression -free survival  will be estimated  using  Kaplan -Meier  methodology.  Toxicity  will 
be reported  by type, frequency  and severity  according  to the most  recent  NCI Common  Toxicity  Criteria

 Response  rate (CR+PR)  and disease  control  rate (CR+PR+SD)  (estimated  by RECIST  and immune  
related  response  criteria)  will be calculated  along  with the corresponding  confidence  interval  will be 
reported.   Duration  of response  will be summarized  among  responders.  
 
A minimum  of of 2 patients  and a maximum  of 24 patients  will be accrued  to the phase  I portion  of this 
trial. Forty -eight  patients  will be accrued  to the phase  II portion  of the trial. It is anticipated  that 8 
patients  per month  will be accrued  and the entire  study  will be completed  within  4 years.  
 
 
For the correlative  studies, the analysis  is primarily  exploratory  for the subjects from whom  we obtain  
biologic  samples.  Appropriate  descriptive  statistical measures  will be used  to summarize  the data.   For 
each  tumor specific  cohort separately,  pre and post comparisons  will be assessed  on the biopsy  
specimens.   For binary  markers, McNemars  test  and for continuous  markers, the Wilcoxon  signed  rank 
test will be utilized  to assess  changes  pre versus  post treatment.  
 
 
14.2 1 Pharmacodynamic  Analysis  
 
Correlative  studies  will be performed  on biologic  specimens  obtained  from subjects  in the Phase  I and 
Phase  II portions  of this trial. 
 
Flow  cytometric  results  for lymphocyte  subsets  and CCR4+  T cell counts  will be tabulated  and 
presented  graphically  by cohort  and time.  The results  of other PD  assessments  (will be summarized  
using  descriptive  statistics.  
 
Treg cells constitute  a significant  proportion  of TILs and based  on their potent immunoregulatory  
properties  we hypothesize  that Treg  cell depletion  will lead to significant alteration  in the tumor immune  
microenvironment.  A tumor  biopsy  will be obtained  at Baseline  and at Day 15 and investigated  for the 
extent  and consequences  of Treg depletion.  The tumor biopsy  will be taken  by qualified  personnel  
trained  in the procedure.  In these  specimens,  immune  cells and cell subsets  including  dendritic  cells,  
and T and B lymphocytes  as well as their subsets  will be qualitatively  and quantitatively  evaluated  by 
IHC for morphology,  activation,  and maturation  status.  Phenotypic  analysis  of TILs by flow cytometry   
will be performed  using  validated  antibody  panels  to identify  and characterize  tumor  infiltrating  T cells 
and myeloid  cells.  Activation  state  of CD4 and CD8 T cells will be determined  by staining  for lineage  
specific  transcription  factors (T -BET, GATA3,  FOXP3, RORC)  as well as intracellular  cytokine  analysis  
following  in vitro re-stimulation.  Correlative  exploratory immunologic  studies  including, but not limited  to, 
circulating  cytokines, circulating  immune  cells, and tumor cells  will be performed.  
 
Treg cells are critical  mediators  of peripheral  tolerance  and their complete  absence  leads  to 
autoimmunity  in animal  models  and in human  patients  with Foxp3  deficiency.  CCR4+  Treg cells 
represent  a subset  of activated  Treg cells and Treg cells capable  of migrating  to the skin. Specific  
depletion  of Treg cells induced  by KW-0761  will provide  a unique  opportunity  to characterize  the 
consequences  of Treg cell depletion  not only for the tumor  growth, but also for systemic  immune  
activation  and the homeostasis  of a normal  tissue.  If during  the course  of treatment  with KW-0761  there  
is a clinical evident focus  of skin pathology  it will be targeted  for biopsy  as well as nearby  normal skin.  
Hematoxylin  and eosin, CD3,  CD4,  CD8, FoxP3, CCR4,  CD68,  and neutrophil  elastase  stainings  will be 
performed  on 4 mm sections.

 A relatively  recently  appreciated  modulator of intestinal  homeostasis  and systemic  immunity  is the 
intestinal  commensal  microbiota.  The host immune  system and  particularly  Treg cells are central  to 
maintaining  tolerance  to commensal  microbiota112,113112,113111,112. The crosst alk between commensals  
and local immune  cells by Treg can for the first time  be investigated  in humans  with the proposed  
clinical trial.  Fecal specimens  will be collected  and the intestinal  microbiota  will be characterized  
characterized  by 454 pyrosequencing  of the V1-V3 region  of bacterial 16S  ribosomal  RNA genes.  
Microbial diversity  will be estimated  by grouping  sequences  into operational taxonomic  units  and 
calculating  the Shannon  diversity index.  Phylogenetic  classification  will be obtained  using  the 
Ribosomal  Database  Project classifier.  Associations  of the microbiota  with KW-0761  treatment will be 
evaluated.  
 
 
14.3 2 Safety  Analyses  
 
Safety  data from subjects  who have  received  any portion  of KW-0761  will be included  in the safety  
analyses.  The frequency  and severity of AEs will be tabulated.  Baseline, end -of-study,  and change  from 
baseline  laboratory,  vital signs,  and ECG parameters  will be summarized. Shift  tables  will be prepared  
for laboratory  parameters.  Dot plots or box and whisker  plots of selected  lab tests  over time will be 
prepared  where  appropriate.  A listing  of Baseline  and end-of-study  concomitant  medications  will be 
provided.

 The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database  at MSKCC.  Data from this  trial 
will be entered  in the Clinical research  Database  (CRDB).  Source  documentation  will be available  to 
support the computerized  patient record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data. Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  
periodically throughout the  study  period.  
 
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the study  team, at a 
minimum of two times  per year, more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 2 Data and  Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at MSKCC  were  approved  by the National  Cancer  
Institute  in September 2001. The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  
entitled  “Policy  of the National Cancer  Institute  for Data  and Safety Monitoring  of Clinical Trials” which  
can be found  at: http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  plans  at MSKCC  
were  established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical Research. The  MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans  can be  found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at : http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index/htm . 
 
There  are several  different mechanisms  by which  clinical trials  are monitored  for data, safety,  and 
quality. There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification  audits, therapeutic  response, and  staff education  on clinical research  
QA) and  departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  committees that 
are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical trials  programs. The  committees: Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical trials, and  the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
Board  (DSM B) for Phase  III clinical trials, report to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  
Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and  review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its level of risk 
and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every type  of protocol  (e.g. NIH sponsored, in -house  sponsored,  
industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and the monitoring  procedures  will 
be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
 
17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use  and disclosure  of protected  health  information  pursuant to a 
completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use  and disclosure  of protected  health  
information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  Authorization  form.  A Research

 The consent indicates  that samples  and genetic  information  collect ed may be shared  with other  
qualified  researchers  and placed  in online  databases.  An example  of an online  database  is the NIH 
dbGAP  database, which  is monitored  by the National  Institutes  of Health, and  may be made  accessible  
to investigators approved  by the U.S. government. Such  information  will not include  identifying  
information  such  as name.  
The requirements  for submission  of genotype/phenotype  data into the NIH dbGAP  or any other public  
database  will be followed  as per the IRB SOP for Genomic  Data  Sharing.  
 
17.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct normal life  
functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical Events  (IME)  that may not resul t in death, be life threatening, or require  
hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when, based  upon  medical  judgment, they  may 
jeopardize  the patient or subject  and may require  medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one  of 
the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note : Hospital admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is required  for 30- 
days  after the participant’s  last investigational treatment. Any  events  that occur after the 30-day period  
and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol treatment must be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  
Events’,  the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar days  of the event. The IRB requires  a 
Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  electronically  to the SAE Office  as 
follows:  
 
For IND/IDE  trials: Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to saegrade5@mskcc.org . All 
other  reports  should  be sent to saemskind@mskcc.org . 
 
For all other trials: Reports  that inclu de a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to saegrade5@mskcc.org . All 
other  reports  should  be sent to sae@mskcc.org .

Overall Response  using  RECIST  based  immune  related  response  criter ia (irRC)  
 
Antitumor response  based  on total measurable  tumor  burden.  
 
For the irRC,  only index  and measurable  new lesions  are taken  into account (in  contrast to conventional  
criteria, which  do not require  the measurement  of new lesions,  nor do they include  new lesion  measurements  
in the characterization  of evolving  tumor burden).  At the baseline  tumor  assessment, the sum of the products   
of the two largest  perpendicular  diameters  (SPD) of all index  lesions  (five lesions  per organ,  up to 10 visceral  
lesions  and five cutaneous  index  lesions)  is calculated.  At each  subsequent tumor  assessment, the  SPD of the 
index  lesions  and of new, measurable  lesions  (≥5 x 5 mm; up to 5 new  lesions  per organ:  5 new cutaneous  
lesions  and 10 visceral  lesions)  are added  together to provide  the total tumor burden:  
 
Tumor  Burden  = SPD index  lesions  + SPD new, measurable  lesions  
Overall response  using  the irRC.  
The overall  response  according  to the irRC is derived  from time-point response  assessments (based  on tumor  
burden) as follows:  
 
Immune  related  complete  response  (irCR):  complete  disappearance  of all lesions  (whether measurable  or 
not, and  no new lesions) confirmation  by a repeat, consecutive  assessment  no less than 4 weeks  from the date 
first documented  
 
Immune  related  partial response  (irPR):  decrease  in tumor  burden  ≥30%relative  to baseline  confirmed  by a 
consecutive  assessment at least 4 weeks  after first documentation  
 
Immune  related  stable  disease  (irSD):  not meeting  criteria  for irCR or irPR,  in absence  of irPD 
 
Immune  related  progressive  disease  (irPD):  increase  in tumor burden  ≥20% relative  to nadir (minimum  
recorded  tumor burden) confirmation  by a repeat, consecutive  assessment  no less than 4 weeks  from the date 
first documented  
 
An irRC overall  response  of irCR or irPR requires  confirmation  by a second  (confirmatory) evaluation  meeting  
the criteria  for irRC response  and performed  no less than 4 weeks  after the criteria  for response  are first met.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedNumber of Subjects Approximately 160 subjects will be  randomized (1:1) to the VX-6 61/ivacaftor 
combination therapy arm or ivacaftor monotherapy arm. Of the ra ndomized 
subjects, approximately 15% will carry an R117H mutation on the second CFTR
allele.
Study Population Male and female subjects aged 12 years or older with CF who are heterozygous
for the F508del-CFTR mutation and a second CFTR allele with a gating defect 
that is clinically demonstrated to be ivacaftor responsive
Investigational Drug Active substances: VX-661 and ivacaftor 
Activities: CFTR corrector and potentiator (increased chloride ion [Clí] secretion)
Strength and Route of Administration: 100-mg VX-661/150-mg ivacaftor 
fixed-dose combination (light yellow) film-coated tablet for or al administration
Active substance: ivacaftor 
Activity: CF transmembrane potentiator (increased Clísecretion)
Strength and Route of Administration: 150-mg ivacaftor (light blue) 
film-coated tablet for oral administration
Active substance: not applicable
Activity: placebo
Strength and Route of Administration: 0-mg film-coated placebo tablets for 
oral administration visually matching the 100-mg VX-661/150-mg ivacaftor 
fixed-dose combination tablet and the 150-mg ivacaftor tablet.
Study Duration Excluding the Screening Period (approximately 28 days in durati on) and Ivacaftor 
Run-in Period (approximately 4 weeks in duration), subjects who  complete the 
Active Comparator Treatment Period (including those who prematu rely 
discontinue study treatment) will participate in this study for  up to 13 weeks. 
During the Active Comparator Treatment Period, study drug (VX-6 61/ivacaftor or 
ivacaftor only) will be administered up to 8 weeks. 
A Safety Follow-up Visit will occur 28 days ± 7 days after the final dose of study 
drug. A Safety Follow-Up Visit is not required for subjects who  have completed 
the Week 8 Visit and have enrolled in the extension study of VX- 661 in 
combination with ivacaftor within 28 days after the last dose of  study drug.
Study Design This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, ivacaftor-controll ed, parallel-group, 
multicenter study in subjects aged 12 years and older with CF w ho are 
heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and a second CFTR allele with a 
gating defect that is clinically demonstrated to be ivacaftor r esponsive.
This study includes the following:
xScreening Period (Week -8 to Week -4)
xIvacaftor Run-in Period where all subjects will receive ivacaft or (Week -4 to 
Day -1)

bAll subjects will be tested for CFTR genotype. The results of the confirmatory genotype sample obtai ned at the 
Screening Visit must be reviewed before enrollment. In subjects  with confirmed R117H mutation, linkage to poly-T
track polymorphisms will also be determined. Specific instructi ons will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
cWeight and height will be measured with shoes off.
dAn ophthalmologic examination will be conducted on subjects of all ages by an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologic 
examination does not need to be repeated if there is documentat ion of an examination that met the protocol criteria and 
that was conducted within 3 months before the Screening Period or if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal 
(Section 11.7.8 ). Subjects with clinically significant cataracts, lens opacity , Y-suture, or lamellar rings will be excluded 
from the study.

fAny female subject who does not meet the criteria for non-child bearing potential is considered to be of childbearing 
potential and must have a serum pregnancy test.
gA standard digital ECG will be performed after the subject has been supine for at least 5 minutes.
hVital signs and pulse oximetry will be collected after the subj ect has been at rest (seated or supine) for 5 minutes.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated5 INTRODUCTION
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affec ts an estimate d 70,000 children and a dults worldwide1 and is the 
most common fatal genetic diseas e in persons of European descen t.2Based on the size of the 
population, CF qualifies as an orphan disease.3,4Despite progress in the t reatment of CF with 
antibiotics and mucolytics, the pr edicted median age of surviva l for a person with CF is in 
the mid-30s.2,5 Although the disease affects multiple organs, most morbidity a nd mortality 
are caused by progressive loss of lung function.6
CF is an autosomal recessive g enetic disease caused by a defect  in the gene encoding the CF 
transmembrane conductance regula tor protein (CFTR), an epitheli al chloride ion (Clí)
channel activated by cyclic a denosine monophosphate-dependent p rotein kinase A that is 
responsible for aiding in the r egulation of salt and water abso rption and secretion in various 
tissues.2This function is defective in pa tients with CF due to a loss of  either cell surface 
expression and/or function. 
More than 1900 mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified.7 Mutations in the CFTR
gene have been classified base d on the molecular and functional  consequence of the mutation 
on the CFTR protein8,9,10 and can be generally consider ed to reduce the quantity of 
functional CFTR protein that reaches the epithelial cell surfac e or reduce the function of 
CFTR protein located at the cell surface. CFTR  gene mutations that affect the quantity of 
functional cell surface CFTR protein include defects that reduc e CFTR protein synthesis and 
defects that impede the cellular processing and delivery of CFT R proteins to the cell surface.
CFTR gene mutations ass ociated with minimal CFTR function include
xmutations associated with severe defects in ability of the CFTR  channel to open and 
close, known as defective channel gating or “gating mutations”;  
xsevere defects in the cellular  processing of CFTR and its deliv ery to the cell surface;
xno (or minimal) CFT R synthesis; and
xsevere defects in c hannel conductance.
The most prevalent mutation i s an in-frame deletion in the CFTR  gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the  CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR ).10In the United States 
(US), almost 87% of patien ts with CF have at least 1 copy of th e F508del-CFTR mutation 
and about 47% have 2 copies.11 In the European Union (EU), a pproximately 83% of patients 
with CF have 1 or 2 copies of the F508del-CFTR mutation, and approx imately 38.7% of 
patients with CF in the U nited Kingdom have 2 copies.12The F508del-CFTR mutation 
interferes with the ability of  the CFTR protein to reach and re main at the cell surface, as well 
as to open and close, resulting in decreased Clí transport.13,14The combined effect is a 
marked reduction in F50 8del-CFTR-mediated Clísecretion that impairs  fluid regulation and 
promotes accumulation of thick, s ticky mucus in the airway. The  mucus build-up obstructs 
the airways and predisposes the  patient to chronic lung infecti ons.15
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 20 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedTwo complementary approaches t o increase CFTR-mediated Clísecretion in the airway 
epithelia have been studied.9One approach is to treat wit h a compound that will modify the 
cellular processing and traffickin g of the CFTR protein to incr ease the amount of functional 
CFTR at the cell surface. Thi s kind of compound has been termed  a CFTR corrector. Another 
approach is to treat with a com pound that increases the channel  gating activity of protein 
kinase A-activated CFTR at the  cell surface to enhance ion tran sport. This kind of compound 
has been termed a potentiator. D epending on the amount of resid ual CFTR channel activity 
in the membrane and the pathophys iology of that activity (refle cting the CFTR genotype of 
the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be  required to ameliorate lung 
disease in patients with CF . A modest restoration of Clí secretion through the action of a 
potentiator and/or corrector coul d prevent the hyperabsorption of water across the apical 
surface of epithelial cells, allo wing proper maintenance of air way hydration. Adequate 
airway hydration could alleviate the cycle of mucus plugging, i nfection, and inflammation, 
which leads to irreversible struc tural changes in the lungs and , eventually, respiratory failure 
for patients with CF.
VX-661 is a compound developed by Ve rtex Pharmaceuticals Incorp orated (Vertex) that has 
been shown to have CFTR corrector  properties. Several lines of in vitro evidence suggest that 
VX-661 works by promoting the pr oper cellular processing and tr afficking of a fraction of 
the F508del-CFTR protein during its biogenesis and processing i n the endoplasmic 
reticulum, allowing it to exit the endoplasmic r eticulum and tr affic the cell surface.16 When 
added for more than 24 hours to hum an bronchial epithelial (HBE ) cells isolated and cultured 
from lung explants obtained fro m donors with CF (CF-HBE cells) who are homozygous for 
the F508del-CFTR mutation, a concentrati on-dependent increase in levels of matur e 
(i.e., plasma membrane) F508del-CF TR was observed. The increase d trafficking of 
F508del-CFTR to the cell surface resulted in a significant incr ease in Clísecretion.16VX-661 
did not correct the processing a nd localization of other misfol ded or normally fol ded proteins 
other than CFTR, suggesting th at the mechanism of VX-661 action  is selective for CFTR 
(CFTR corrector).17
Ivacaftor (also known as VX-770) is the first CFTR modulator to  show an improvement in 
CFTR function and clini cal benefit in patients with CF. Results  from several Phase 3 studies 
showed that ivacaftor is effectiv e in the treatment of patients  with CF who have mutations 
that result in gating defects as  evidenced by sustained improve ments in CFTR channel 
function (measured by reduction in s weat chloride concentration ) and corresponding 
substantial, durable improvements in lung f unction, respiratory  symptoms, and weight gain. 
Ivacaftor was also well tolerate d, as evidenced by the rates an d reasons for premature 
discontinuation and results  of safety assessments. 
Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is indicate d for the treatment of CF in pa tients as young as 2 years of 
age who have 1 of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, 
G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R , or R117H . Please refer to the ivacaftor IB 
and local prescribing informa tion or summary of product charact eristics for your region for 
the current approved use of Kalydeco.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated8 STUDY DESIGN
8.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a Phase 3, randomize d, double-blind, ivacaftor-controll ed, parallel-group, multicenter 
study in subjects aged 12 years  and older with CF who are heter ozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR  mutation and a second CFTR allele with a gating defect that is clinically 
demonstrated to be ivacaftor responsive ( Section 16 ). 
This study is designed to comp are active treatment of VX-661 (1 00 mg daily [qd]) and 
ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours [q12h]) combination therapy wi th ivacaftor monotherapy 
(150 mg q12h).  
The treatment regimens will be as follows:
xVX-661/ivacaftor combination therapy 
oMorning dose: 1 tablet of fixed-dose combination of VX-661 100 mg/ivacaftor 
150 mg and 1 tablet of placebo visu ally matched to ivacaftor 
oEvening dose: 1 tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg 
xIvacaftor monotherapy 
oMorning dose: 1 tablet of placebo vi sually matched to the fixed -dose combination 
tablet and 1 tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg 
oEvening dose: 1 tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg 
This study includes a Screening Period (approximately 28 days),  an Ivacaftor Run-in Period 
(approximately 4 weeks), an Active Comparator Treatment Period (up to 8 weeks), and a 
Safety Follow-up Visit (approxima tely 28 days after last dose). Following the Ivacaftor 
Run-in Period, approximately 160 s ubjects will be randomized in  a ratio of 1:1 to receive 
either VX-661/ivacaftor combina tion therapy or ivacaftor monoth erapy for 8 weeks during 
the Active Comparator Treatme nt Period. The randomization will be stratified by age at the

(R117H versus other allowed mutations; Section 16 ), and percent predicted FEV 1severity 
determined at the e nd of the Ivacaftor Run- in Period (<70 versu s t70; see Figure 8-1 ). Of the 
randomized subjects, approximately 15% will carry an R117H  mutation on the second CFTR
allele ( Section 16 ). Week 8 is the conclusion of the A ctive Comparator Treatment Period of 
the study. 
Subjects who complete the Week 8 V isit, regardless of whether t hey have prematurely 
discontinued study drug treatme nt, will be offered the opportun ity to enroll in an extension 
study, if they meet the eligibility criteria. 
All subjects randomized in the Ac tive Comparator Treatment Peri od will be required to 
complete study assessments for  all scheduled visits through Wee k 8, regardless of whether 
they have prematurely discontinued study treatment ( Section 8.1.5 ).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated8.1.1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)
Repetition of individual screenin g assessment(s) that did not m eet eligibility criteria is not 
permitted with the following exceptions: 
xIf there is clear evidence of a l aboratory error (e.g., hemolyz ed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection of a repeat  sample for the appropriate laboratory test or 
assessment may be permitted with the approval of the medical mo nitor.
xExclusionary liver function tes t (LFT) levels, which may be ret ested within 14 days of 
the original screening date.
If screening spirometry measurements fail to meet acceptability  and repeatability criteria as 
specified by American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respirato ry Society (ERS) 
guidelines,20repeat spirometry evalua tion may be performed once.
If repeat values of the individua l assessment(s) are within the  eligibility criteria and 
completed within the screening window, then the subject is elig ible for the study.
8.1.1.2 Rescreening
Subjects may only be rescreened w ith the approval of the medica l monitor. If a subject is 
rescreened, all screening asse ssments will be repeated except f or CF genotyping, 
follicle-VWLPXODWLQJKRUPRQH)6+OHYHO LIVHUXP)6+OHYHOZDV mIU/mL during prior 
screening), sweat chloride, a nd the ophthalmologic examination (if performed within the last 
3 months). If a subject is resc reened, the screening window wil l begin once the first 
rescreening assessment has been initiated.
8.1.1.3 Extension of the Screening Period Window
A subject may have the Screenin g Period window extended by 2 we eks for the following 
reasons:
xUnexpected operational or logis tic delays, or to meet the eligi bility criteria
xRepetition of the Screening Peri od assessments (Section 8.1.1.1)
xAdditional time to conduct ophtha lmologic examinations ( Section 11.7.8 ) 
8.1.2 Ivacaftor Run-in Period (4 Weeks)
The Ivacaftor Run-in Period w ill have a total duration of 4 wee ks and is designed to establish 
a reliable on-treatment (ivacafto r monotherapy) baseline for th e Active Comparator 
Treatment Period. The first dose  of open-label ivacaftor will b e administered at the Week -4 
Visit. The last dose of open-labe l ivacaftor will be administer ed in the evening on Day -1 
(1 day prior to the Day 1 Visit) . With prior approval of the me dical monitor, the Ivacaftor 
Run-in Period may be extended i f the subject does not meet crit eria for entry into the Active 
Comparator Treatment Period ( Section 8.1.3 ).
Study visits during the Ivacafto r Run-in Period will occur as s hown in Table 3-2 . Subjects 
will be outpatients during the Iv acaftor Run-in Period. All vis its should occur within the 
windows specified. 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 25 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedSubjects who prematurely discon tinue study drug treatment durin g the Ivacaftor Run-in 
Period will not be rando mized or participate in the Active Comp arator Treatment Period. 
These subjects will complete an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit. The Safety Follow-up 
Visit will be their last visit in the study.
8.1.3 Active Comparator Treatment Period (8 Weeks)
The Active Comparator Treatment  Period will last  approximately 8 weeks. Subjects will be 
randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (VX-661/ivacaftor or ivacaft or alone) as shown in 
Figure 8-1 .  
The first dose of the randomize d study drug will be administere d after randomization on 
Day 1. Dosing details are given in Section 10.2 .
In order to continue into the Ac tive Comparator Treatment Perio d, subjects must have stable 
CF disease (as judged by the investigator) and have remained on  a stable CF medication 
regimen during the run-in period. If these criteria are not met  (for example, if the subject has
an acute upper or lower respira tory infection, pulmonary exacer bation, or changes in therapy 
[including antibiotics] for pulmonary disease within 28 days be fore the Day 1 Visit [first 
dose of study drugs in the Active Comparator Treatment Period]) , possible extension of the 
Ivacaftor Run-in Period should be di scussed with the medical mo nitor. 
Study visits during the Active Comparator Treatment Period will  occur as shown in 
Table 3-2 . Subjects will be outpatients durin g the Active Comparator Tre atment Period. All 
visits should occur within the windows specified. 
Subjects who prematurely disconti nue study treatment during the  Active Comparator 
Treatment Period will remain in t he study from the time of disc ontinuation of study treatment 
through the Week 8 Visit and compl ete assessments for all study  visits, as described in 
Section 8.1.5.
8.1.4 Safety Follow-up
The Safety Follow-up Visit a ssessments are listed in Table 3-2 . There will be  an outpatient 
Safety Follow-up Visit 28 days ±  7 days after the last dose of s tudy drug for subjects who 
complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prematurely dis continue study drug dosing. 
If the Early Treatment Termina tion (ETT) Visit occurs 3 weeks or  later following the last 
dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow-up Visit, and a separate 
Safety Follow-up Visit will not be required. 
The Safety Follow-up Visit is not  required for subjects who com plete the Week 8 Visit and 
have enrolled in the extension s tudy of VX-661 in combination w ith ivacaftor within 28 days 
after the last dose of study drug. 
8.1.5 Early Treatment Termination
If the subject prematurely disc ontinues study treatment, an ETT  Visit should be scheduled as 
soon as possible after the subject  decides to terminate study t reatment. Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue treatme nt will also be required to comp lete the Safety Follow-up 
Visit, approximately 28 (± 7) days  after their last dose of stu dy drug. The assessments 
performed at the Safety Follow-up Visit are listed in  Table 3-2 .

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporatedendpoint was selected in order t o obtain a more robust assessme nt of the durability of 
response that is less affected b y short-term variability in FEV 1. The Week 8 Visit is the 
conclusion of the Active Comparat or Treatment Period in this st udy.
8.2.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration
The dose regimen of VX-661 chose n for continued development in Phase 3 was studied in 
Study 101 in 2 CF populations: F508del-CFTR  homozygous subjects (Group 4) and 
F508del-CFTR  heterozygous subjects who had G551D-CFTR  on the other alle le (Group 7). 
The dose regimen of VX-661 100 mg qd in combination with ivacaf tor 150 mg q12h 
provided clinically meaningful a nd statistically significant im provements in percent predicted 
FEV 1 in both populations, as well as a s ignal of CFTR modulation as  assessed by the change 
in sweat chloride.
The dose regimen of ivacaftor planned for this study (150 mg q1 2h) is the current approved 
dose regimen for patients with C F with gating mutations who are  aged 6 years and older. 
8.2.3 Rationale for Study Population
The study population will be subjects with CF 12 years of age a nd older who are 
heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR  mutation and a second CFTR allele with a gating defect 
that is clinically demonstrate d to be ivacaftor responsive. Bas ed on the results from 
Study 101 ( Section 8.2.1 ), subjects with the F508del-CFTR  mutation on only 1 allele may 
respond to VX-661/ivacaftor combin ation therapy when the second  allele is also responsive 
to potentiator modulation. 
Patients with CF who have CFTR alleles that qualify them for  inclusion in this study may 
live in a region where ivacaftor (Kalydeco) is already approved  for patients with their 
mutations and is available for us e by prescription. Because of this, it is anticipated that this 
study will enroll both subjects who have been exposed to ivacaf tor within 28 days prior to the 
Screening Visit and subjects w ho have not. The intent of this s tudy is to determine if 
VX-661/ivacaftor combination thera py has additiona l benefit ove r ivacaftor monotherapy in 
this population. Subjects who have be en exposed to ivacaftor wi thin 28 days prior to the 
Screening Visit must have an FEV 1DQG 90% of predicted normal for age, sex, and 
height at the Screening Visit . Those who have not been exposed to ivacaftor within 28 days 
prior to the Screening Visit must have an FEV 1DQGRISUHGLFW HGQRUPDOIRUDJH
sex, and height at the Screening Visit.
The inclusion of subjects with C F who are 12 to 17 years of age  is justified based on severity 
of disease and allometric scalin g. The overall disease status f or the adolescent and adult 
populations to be enrolled in this study is anticipated to be s imilar based on the identical 
enrollment criteria, particularly the FEV 1and the requirement for c linical stability. Both 
VX-661 and ivacaftor are predominan tly eliminated by metabolism  via the cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 3A4 enzymatic pathway. The m aturity of the CYP enzymes in  adolescents is expected 
to be similar to adults.21 Therefore, the low likeliho od of differences in PK of VX-661 a nd 
ivacaftor between adolescents a nd adults further supports the i nclusion of adolescents in this 
study. The dose regimen of ivacaftor planned for this study (15 0 mg q12h) is the current 
labeled dose regimen for  patients with CF with gating mutations  who are aged 6 years and 
older. Based on the historical data  from the ivacaftor Phase 3 program and the US CF

medication from 28 days before We ek -4 through the Safety Follo w-up Visit unless it is 
discussed and approved by the Ver tex medical monitor. Guideline s for stable medication 
regimens for CF are as follows:
oSubjects who are taking daily i nhaled tobramycin or other chron ically inhaled 
antibiotics should remain on that re gimen throughout the study.  
oSubjects who are on inhaled cyclin g antibiotics should continue  on their prior 
schedule. The timing  of the first dose of  study drug should be synchronized as closely 
as possible to the first day of  inhaled cycling antibiotics in the cycle.
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 34 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedoSubjects who alternate 2 differe nt antibiotics monthly should r emain on the same 
schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of stud y drug should be 
synchronized as closely as possi ble to the first day of 1 of th e inhaled alternating 
antibiotics.
xSubjects may receive doses of prednisone of up to 10 mg/day (ch ronically) or prednisone 
60 mg qd for up to 5 days without prio r approval of the medical  monitor.
xInformation about bronchodilator  use during the study will be c ollected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchod ilator must have their spirome try assessments 
performed according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.6.1 .
xConcomitant use of medicati ons known to prolong the QT interval  should be used with 
caution during the study, as the effect of VX-661 in combinatio n with ivacaftor on the 
QT interval has not been evaluat ed in a thorough QT study. Cons ideration should be 
given to obtaining an ECG when c oncomitant medication known to prolong the QT 
interval is administered.
9.5 Removal of Subjects 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own re quest. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discreti on of the investigator or 
Vertex for safety, behavior, nonc ompliance with study procedure s, or administrative reasons. 
If a subject has been withdrawn fro m study drug treatment, the subject should continue to be 
followed as outlined in Section 8.1.5 , provided the subject has  not withdrawn consent.  
If a subject does not return for a  scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, r easonable effort will be made to  document subject outcome. 
The investigator will inquire a bout the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return 
all unused investigati onal product(s), reque st that the subject  return for a Safety Follow-up 
Visit, if applicable ( Section 8.1.4 ), and follow up with the subject  regarding any unresolved 
AEs.
If the subject withdraws consen t, no further evaluations will b e performed and no additional 
data will be collected. Vertex  may retain and continue to use a ny data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.  
The investigator should inquire  about the reason for withdrawal  of consent.  
Subjects must return all unused s tudy drug and return for all s cheduled visits. 
A subject will be withdrawn from study treatment for any of the  following reasons: 
xA female subject or a female pa rtner of a male subject has a co nfirmed pregnancy.
xA subject’s treatment is unb linded by the investigator.
A subject may be withdrawn from st udy treatment after a discuss ion between the investigator 
and the medical monitor for an y of the following reasons: 
xA subject develops a medical c ondition that requires prolonged concomitant therapy with 
a prohibited medication or prolonge d interruption of the study drug. 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 35 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedxA subject develops a life-threat ening AE or a serious adverse e vent (SAE) that places 
him/her at immediate risk, and di scontinuation of study treatme nt deemed necessary.
xA subject is noncompliant with study requirements. 
xA subject has an increase in trans aminases (ALT or AST) accordi ng to evaluations and 
management described in Section 11.7.7 .
xA subject has an increase in QTc  according to evaluations and m anagement described in 
Section 11.7.4 .
xA subject develops a cat aract or lens opacity.

fat-containing food such as a “st andard CF” high-fat, high-calo rie meal or snack according to 
the following guidelines: 
1. Throughout the Ivacaftor Run- in Period and the Active Treatme nt Comparator Period, 
study drugs will be administere d after the start and before the  end of a meal. It is 
recommended that the duration of e ach meal associated with stud y drug intake (i.e., 
breakfast and dinner/snack, as a pplicable) should not exceed 30  minutes.
2. Study drug should be admin istered q12h (± 2 hours). For each subject, all doses (morning 
and evening) of study drugs will  be taken at approximately the same time each day. For 
example, the morning dose coul d be taken at 08:00 every morning  and the evening dose 
could be taken at 20:00 every eve ning throughout the study. 
3. At the Week -4 Visit, all s ubjects will be observed for 1 hou r after the morning dose of 
study drug. At the Day 1 Vis it, all subjects will be observed f or 6 hours after the morning 
dose of study drug. 
4. The date, amount tak en, and time of study dr ug administration , including whether food 
was taken with each dos e, will be recorded for 2 days before PK  sample collection and on 
the days of PK sample collection.
5. On days of scheduled visits, t he morning dose of study drug w ill be administered at the 
site after predose assessments  have been completed. The meal or  snack will be provided 
by the site for the morning dose of study drug.  
6. If a subject's scheduled vis it is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used: 
xIf the dose in the clinic will  be within 6 hours of the subject 's scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should withhold the ir morning dose of study d rug and the morning 
dose will be adminis tered in the clinic.
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 37 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedxIf the dose in the clinic will be  more than 6 hours after the s ubject's scheduled 
morning dose, the subject shoul d take the morning dose at home and the evening dose 
will be administered i n the clinic. In this e vent, all assessmen ts will be collected 
relative to the evening dose.
7. For visits after the Week - 4 Visit, subjects will be instruct ed to bring all used and unused 
study drug to the site; study  drug will be dispensed at each vi sit, as appropriate.
8. At the Week 8 Visit, the morning dose of study drug will NOT be  administered. The last 
dose of study drug will be the  evening dose administered the da y before the Week 8 
Visit.
10.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
Approximately 160 subjects will be s tratified by age at the Scr eening Visit (<18 versus 
 years of age), type of mutation on the second CFTR allele ( R117H versus other allowed 
mutations;  Section 16 ), and percent predicted FEV 1severity determine d at the end of the

An interactive web response syst em (IWRS) will be used to assig n subjects to study 
treatment, as well as to ensure randomization of approximately 15% of subjects with an 
R117H  mutation on the second CFTR allele. Detailed ins tructions for ra ndomization will be 
provided separately.  
10.4 Dose Modification for Toxicity
Neither the dosage of individual study drugs nor the combinatio n therapy can be altered, but 
the investigator can interrupt  or stop treatment with all study drugs.
10.5 Study Drug Interruption
If study drug dosing must be i nterrupted for more than 72 hours , the medical monitor must be 
notified. In these instances, s tudy drug dosing may only resume  after approval by the medical 
monitor. Specific instructions f or interruption f or elevated LF T levels and elevated QTc 
levels are provided in Section 11.7.7 and Section 11.7.4 , respectively. 
10.6 Missed Doses
If a subject misses a dose and r emembers the missed dose within  6 hours, the subject should 
take his/her dose with food. If  more than 6 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, 
the subject should skip that dose and resume his/ her normal sch edule for the following dose. 
For example,
xif the morning dose of study dr ug should have been taken at app roximately 08:00, and the 
subject remembers at 12:00 that he /she forgot to take his/her d ose, he/she should take the 
dose with food as soon as possible. 
xif the morning dose of study dr ug should have been taken at app roximately 08:00, and 
more than 6 hours have elapsed be yond the scheduled dosing time  (i.e., the time is past 
14:00), the subject would resume dos ing with the evening dose a t approximately 20:00.

10.9 Drug Accountability
The pharmacist or designated site  staff will maintain records d ocumenting the dates and 
amounts of  
xstudy drug received,  
xstudy drug dispensed to the subjects, and  
xstudy drug returned by the subjects.  
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 39 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedSubjects will be instructed to r eturn all used, partially used,  and full study drug blister cards 
to the site. These materials will be retained at the site accor ding to instructions provided by 
Vertex or its designee until inventoried by the study monitor. The study monitor will verify 
study drug records and inventory throughout the study. 
10.10 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug
The site staff or pharmacy pers onnel will retain a ll materials returned by the subjects until the 
site monitor has performed drug  accountability. At the end of t he study, the study monitor 
will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused i nvestigational product. If the 
study monitor authorizes destru ction at the study site, the inv estigator will ensure that the 
materials are destroyed in comp liance with applicable environme ntal regulations, 
institutional policy, and any sp ecial instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be 
adequately documented.
Procedures for destruction or ret urn of the study drug will be detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.
10.11 Compliance
To ensure treatment compliance , the investigator or designee wi ll supervise all study drug 
dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel w ill review that the subject is 
compliant with study drug dosin g and remind the subject of stud y drug dosing requirements. 
Compliance will also be assesse d by ongoing study drug count. 
If a subject demonstrates conti nued noncompliance of study drug  dosing despite educational 
efforts, the investigator shoul d contact the medical monitor to  discuss discontinuation of the 
subject from the study treatment.
10.12 Blinding and Unblinding
This is a double-blind study. 
10.12.1 Blinding
The subjects and all site personne l, including the investigator , the site monitor, and the study 
team, will be blinded with the e xception of the following: 
xAny site personnel for whom thi s information is important to en sure the safety of the 
subject in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency
xAny site personnel for whom thi s information is important to en sure the safety of the 
subject and their fetus in t he event of a pregnancy 
xVertex Global Patient Safety (G PS) and Regulatory Affairs perso nnel to satisfy SAE 
processing and reporting regulations 
xUnblinded statistician pr eparing the final (production) randomi zation list who is not part 
of the study team

Vertex Drug Metabolism and Pharm acokinetics laboratory personne l will not be involved in 
the conduct of the study and w ill be unblinded to the bioanalys is results but will remain 
blinded to subject number a nd treatment assignment. 
Spirometry Data Blinding
Despite treatment bli nding, knowledge of the  spirometry results  has the potential to suggest 
whether a subject has been admin istered active study drug or co rresponding active control. 
Therefore, during the conduct of  the study, the Vertex study te am will not have access to the 
postdose spirometry data during the Active Comparator Treatment  Period. The vendor for 
central reading of the spirome try data will only send the blind ed spirometry files (blinded 
treatment group with dummy values  for all the spirometry assess ment after baseline in the 
Active Comparator Treatment Per iod) to Vertex to be used for de veloping the statistical 
programs. Furthermore, subjects and their caregivers should not  be informed of their 
study-related spirometry results  during the Active Comparator T reatment Period regardless 
of whether the subject has premat urely discontinued treatment.
Sweat Chloride Data Blinding
Despite treatment bli nding, knowledge of the s weat chloride dat a has the potential to suggest 
whether a subject has been admin istered active study treatment or corresponding active 
control. Therefore, during the c onduct of the study, the Vertex  study team will not have 
access to the postdose sweat chl oride data; dummy data will be used to develop statistical 
programs. During the process of  locking the clin ical database a nd after all study visits have 
been completed, treatment-blinde d access to the sweat chloride data will be provided to a 
small group of individuals who are  not involved in the study. T his group, which will consist 
of a biostatistician, a  statistical programme r, a validation st atistical prog rammer, and a 
clinical reviewer, will review the sweat chloride data to ensur e there are no significant data 
issues and will use the blinded da ta set to refine the statisti cal programs.
10.12.2 Unblinding
At the initiation of the study, t he study site w ill be instruct ed on the method for breaking the 
blind. The unblinding method will be  either a manual or electro nic process. 
Unblinding of the individual subj ect's treatment by the investi gator will be limited to medical 
emergencies or urgent clinical  situations in which knowledge of  the subject's study treatment 
is necessary for clinical manag ement. In such cases, investigat ors should use their best 
judgment as to whether to unbli nd without first attempting to c ontact the medical monitor to 
discuss and agree to the need f or unblinding. If investigators deem that it is not necessary to 
unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the med ical monitor to discuss and 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 41 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporatedagree to the need for unblinding. If investigators have tried b ut are unable to reach the 
medical monitor, they should us e their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the 
clinical situation, and may pro ceed with unblinding without hav ing successfully reached and 
discussed the situation w ith the medical monitor.
Contact information for the medi cal monitor (or appropriate bac kup) will be provided in a 
separate document.
In addition, the Vertex Medical I nformation Call Center  will a nswer calls 
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and will t riage these calls to the Vertex 
medical monitor or appropriate backup.  
If a subject's treatment assignm ent has been unblinded for a me dical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the Vertex medical monitor should be notifi ed within 24 hours of the 
unblinding event. The reason and t he date of the unblinding sho uld be documented clearly in 
the subject's study file. Inform ation about the t reatment assig nment obtained from the 
unblinding will be maintained in a  secure location with control led access and will not be 
shared with the sponsor (Vertex ), contract research organizatio n (CRO), or any s ite personnel 
(other than the physician trea ting the subject). In addition, th e investigator will consider 
whether the clinical event tha t prompted unblinding will be con sidered an SAE, according to 
the regulatory definitions or cr iteria for SAEs, and if so, sub mit an SAE report to Vertex GPS 
or designee, per Section 13.1.2 .
Vertex GPS or designee will als o unblind any SAE reports in com pliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In additi on, Vertex may, for matters re lating to safety concerns, 
unblind individual subjects at any time. 
11 ASSESSMENTS
11.1 Timing of Assessments
The timing of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 andTable 3-2 .
The CFQ-R questionnaire must be  performed before any other asse ssment at the clinic visits 
when it is required. For the re maining assessments, the followi ng assessments must be 
performed in the following orde r when more than 1 assessment is  required at a particular 
time point:
3. standard 12-lead E CG recordings  
4. vital signs and pulse oximetry5. spirometry6. sweat chloride7. safety laboratory assessm ents (including blood draws) 
8. PK sampling
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 42 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedNote: where repeats of the same assessment are required at a gi ven visit, if study drug is not 
administered on the day of the vis it (for any reason, including  study drug interruption or 
premature discontinuation of s tudy drug), only 1 set of assessm ents will be collected 
(Table 3-2 ).
11.1.1 Informed Consent/Assent
Each subject of age of consent (p er local requirements) must si gn and date a study-specific 
ICF before any study-specific  procedures can be performed. Subj ects not of age of consent 
must assent, if applicable per lo cal requirements, to participa te in the study, and the subject's 
parent or legal guardian must s ign and date a study-specific IC F before any study-specific 
procedures can be performed. The  consent forms will comply with  all applicable regulations 
governing the protection of huma n subjects. An ICF and Assent F orm, approved by Vertex 
and the site's institutional revi ew board (IRB) or ethics commi ttee, must be used. 
11.1.2 Assigning Subject Number
Once a subject has signed an ICF  or assent, if applicable, a su bject number will be assigned. 
The subject will retain this numbe r for the entire study. Detai led instructions on assigning 
subject numbers will be provided i n the Study Reference Manual.  If a subject is rescreened, 
the subject retains the  original subject number.
11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics
Subject and disease char acteristics include the following: demo graphics, medical history, 
height, and weight. 
Medical history will be elicited from each subject during scree ning. Based on the medical 
history, the subject will be asse ssed for any disqualifying med ical conditions as specified in 
the inclusion and exclusion criteri a. The medical history shall  include a complete review of 
systems, past medical and surgi cal histories, and any allergies .
11.3 Total Blood Volume
Total blood volume will be outlined i n the laboratory manual.  
11.4 Pharmacokinetics
11.4.1 Blood Sampling
Blood samples will be collected as shown in Table 3-2 .
At the visits and time points indicated in Table 3-2 , blood samples will be c ollected for the 
determination of the  concentrations of VX-661, M1-661, ivacafto r, and M1-ivacaftor. Blood 
samples collected before dosing must be collected within 60 min utes before dosing. The 
acceptable windows for PK samp ling time points are detailed in Table 11-1 .
Samples from the PK sampling w ill be kept frozen by Vertex or i ts designee until all analyses 
have been completed and then dis posed of according to Vertex or  designee standard 
operating procedures. 
For each visit with a PK blood dr aw, a record of study drug adm inistration will be collected 
as described in Section 10.2 . The collection date  and time that each PK blood sample is 
drawn will also be recorded.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated11.6 Efficacy
11.6.1 Spirometry
Spirometry will be performed according to the ATS/ERS guideline s20at the time points 
noted in Table 3-1 andTable 3-2 according to the additional guidelines that follow. 
Prebronchodilator spirometry is  defined as spirometry testing p erformed for subjects who 
have 
xwithheld their short- acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) o r anticholinergic 
(e.g., ipratropium bromide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4 hours be fore the spirometry 
assessment;
xwithheld their long-acting bron chodilator (e.g., s almeterol) fo r more than 12 hours before 
the spirometry assessment; and
xwithheld their once-daily, long -acting bronchodilator (e.g., ti otropium bromide 
[Spiriva®]) for more than 24 hours before  the spirometry assessment.
During the treatment periods ( both Ivacaftor Run-in Period and the Active Comparator 
Treatment Period), spirometry a ssessments must be performed bef ore dosing. In adolescent 
subjects (<18 years of age at th e Screening Visit) additional p ostdose spirometry assessments 
on Day 1 and Day 15 will be perform ed at 2 and 4 hours after th e morning dose as a safety 
assessment. A window for ± 15 minutes will be allowed around th e nominal times for all 
postdose spirometry assessments.
During the Screening Period, spi rometry assessments may be perf ormed pre- or 
postbronchodilators. At all other  visits, all spirometry assess ments should be performed 
“prebronchodilator.” 
In the event that a subject  does not withhold his/her bronchodi lator(s), spirometry should be
performed according to the following: 
During the Ivacaftor Run-in Period 
xIf a subject's Week -4 spirometry is prebronchodilator, but, on  a subsequent visit during 
the Ivacaftor Run-in Peri od, the subject does not withhold bron chodilator use, a 
postbronchodilator spirometry w ill be obtained for that visit o nly, and the visit will not be 
rescheduled.
xIf, on Week -4, the subject does  not withhold his/her dose of b ronchodilator, spirometry 
should be performed postbronchodila tor, and subsequent spiromet ric measurements 
during the Ivacaftor Run-in Per iod (according to the schedule o f assessment s detailed in 
Table 3-2 ) should be performed postbronchodilator. 
During the Active Compar ator Treatment Period
xIf a subject's Day 1 spirometry is prebronchodilator, but, on a  subsequent visit during the 
Active Comparator Treatment P eriod, the subject does not withho ld bronchodilator use, a 
postbronchodilator spirometry w ill be obtained for that visit o nly, and the visit will not be 
rescheduled.
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 45 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedxIf, on Day 1, the subject does not  withhold his/her dose of bro nchodilator, spirometry 
should be performed postbronchodilato r, and all subsequent spir ometric measurements 
during the Active Comparator Treatment Period (according to the  schedule of 
assessments detailed in Table 3-2 ) should be performed postbronchodilator.

11.6.2 Sweat Chloride Testing
The sweat chloride test is a st andard diagnostic tool for CF, s erving as a biomarker of CFTR 
activity. Collection of sweat s amples will be performed at visi ts specified in Table 3-1 and 
Table 3-2 , using an approved collection de vice. Sweat samples will be se nt to a central 
laboratory for testing and in terpretation of results. Individua l sweat chloride test results will 
not be disclosed to the study sites . Specific instructions for collection, handling, processing, 
and shipping of sweat chloride sa mples to the central laborator y will be provided separately.
The sweat chloride collection on dosing days should occur befor e the morning dose of the 
study drugs. At each time point , 2 samples will be collected, 1  from each arm (left and right). 
Additionally, sweat chloride collection will be  performed at th e Screening Visit and the ETT 
Visit. For subjects using sweat c hloride values documented in t heir medical records to 
establish eligibility, the sweat chloride test at the Screening  Visit is optional. Collection of 
sweat chloride will not overlap w ith any other study assessment s.

For purposes of study conduct, onl y laboratory tests done in th e central laboratory may be 
used. At the discretion of the lo cal investigator, local labora tories may be used for 
management of urgent medical issu es. If a local laboratory test  value is found to be abnormal 
and clinically significant, it should be verified by the centra l laboratory as soon as possible 
after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If  it is not possible to send a 
timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was  hospitalized els ewhere), the 
investigator may base the asse ssment of an AE on the local labo ratory value. 
11.7.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs
A PE of all body systems and vita l signs assessment will be per formed at the Screening and 
Week -4 Visits (see Table 3-1 andTable 3-2 ). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and 
symptom-directed vital sign asse ssments can be performed at the  discretion of the 
investigator or healthcare provider .
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyr oid; eyes/ears/nose/throat; 
respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; muscul oskeletal; and ne urological. 
Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed w hen medically indicated. 
After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings i n PEs will be re ported as AEs.
Vital signs include blood pressu re (systolic and diastolic), te mperature (oral), pulse rate, and 
respiration rate. The se will be assessed fo llowing a 5-minute r est in the seated or supine

Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with pr intout according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1 andTable 3-2 ). A window of ± 15 minutes will be 
allowed around the nominal times fo r all postdose ECG assessmen ts. Additional standard 
12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of 
all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:
xThe subject will be instructed t o rest in the supine position f or at least 5 minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
xThe ECG will be performed before a ny other procedures that may affect heart rate, such 
as blood draws. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the S creening and Safety Follow-up 
Visits. A printout of the ECG tr aces will be made for safety re view by the investigator and 
maintained with source document ation. Clinically significant EC G abnormalities occurring 
during the study through the Sa fety Follow-up Visit will be rec orded as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subject s, a qualified individual at the  study site will make 
comparisons to baseline measuremen ts. If the QTcF is increased by >45 msec from the

11.7.5 Contraception and Pregnancy
11.7.5.1 Contraception
The effects of VX-661 monothera py or in combination with ivacaf tor on conception, 
pregnancy, and lactation in human s are not known. Neither VX-66 1 nor ivacaftor showed 
any genotoxic potential in a sta ndard battery of in vitro (Ames  test, Chinese hamster ovary 
cell chromosomal aberration) a nd in vivo (mouse micronucleus) s tudies. VX-661 and 
ivacaftor were each found to be nont eratogenic in reproductive toxicology studies in rats and 
rabbits.18,19Subjects should follow the cont raception require ments outlined in this study 
protocol. The effects of VX-661 m onotherapy or in combination w ith ivacaftor on the PK of 
hormonal contraceptives are not  known. Thus, hormonal contracep tion is not an acceptable 
method of contraception for fema le subjects though it is accept able for the female partners of 
male subjects.
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 51 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedAt this stage in the developm ent of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, participation in 
this study requires a commitment from the research subject and his/her partner to use at least 
1 effective method of birth contro l. Acceptable methods of cont raception for participants of 
this study and their partners a re listed below. Methods of cont raception should be in 
successful use from signing of consent, approximately 28 days, before the first dose of study 
drug (unless otherwise noted) , and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:
xTrue abstinence for the subject, w hen this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject. Periodic abstin ence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,  symptothermal, and 
postovulation methods) and withdraw al are not acceptable method s of contraception. 
xIf the male is infertile (e.g., b ilateral orchiectomy). Inferti lity may be documented 
through examination of a semen s pecimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas 
deferens by ultrasound or medical  record before the first dose of study drug. 
xIf the female is of non-childbearing potential, per the followi ng: 
oPostmenopausal: spontaneous ame norrhea for at least 12 consecut ive months and 
serum FSH level mIU/mL at Screening
oDocumented hysterectomy or a b ilateral oophorectomy/salpingo-oo phorectomy 
oHas not achieved menarche (has  not had her first menstrual peri od). Females who fall 
into this category are consid ered not to be of childbearing pot ential only as long as 
they have not had their first men strual period. If a female ach ieves menarche during 
the study, she will need to provide consent for compliance (pro per method of 
contraception or abstinence).  
xNOTE: All other female subjects w ho have had their  first menstr ual period will be 
considered to be of childbearing potential. 
Acceptable contraceptive methods:
Acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects or male partners of female subjects 
include the following: 
xVasectomy 6 months or more prev iously, with a documented negati ve postvasectomy 
semen analysis for sperm
xCondom and spermicide  
oIn countries where spermicide is not available , condom without spermicide will be 
considered acceptable.
oLocal regulations may require use of an additional acceptable m ethod of 
contraception.  
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 52 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedAcceptable contraceptive methods for female subjects  include the following: 
xBilateral tubal ligation performe d at least 6 months previously 
xContinuous use of an intrauterine  device (non-hormone-releasing ) for at least 90 days 
before the first dose of study drug 
xBarrier contraception (such as  diaphragm, cervical cap, or fema le condom) and 
spermicide 
oIn countries where spermicide is  not available, ba rrier contrac eption without 
spermicide will be considered acceptable.
oLocal regulations may require us e of an additional acceptable m ethod of

xNOTE: Hormonal contraceptives w ill not be consider ed as an effe ctive method; however, 
female subjects are not require d to discontinue hormonal contra ceptives. 
Acceptable contraceptive methods for female partners of male subjects: 
xBilateral tubal ligation perform ed at least 6 months previously  
xContinuous use of an intrauterin e device for at least 90 days b efore the first dose of study 
drug 
xBarrier contraception (such as  diaphragm, cervical cap, or fema le condom) and 
spermicide
oIn countries where spermicide is not available , condom without spermicide will be 
considered acceptable.  
oLocal regulations may require use of an additional acceptable m ethod of 
contraception. 
xHormonal contraceptives, if succes sfully used for at least 60 d ays before the first dose of 
study drug  
Additional notes:
xAcceptable methods of contracepti on listed above are examples. Local requirements may 
prohibit the use of some of these  examples. Please contact the medical monitor with any 
questions. 
xA female condom cannot be used w ith male condom (as a double me thod of 
contraception) due t o risk of tearing. 
xMale and female subjects who are  not sexually active at the tim e of screening must agree 
to follow the contraceptive requi rements of this study if they become sexually active with 
a partner of the opposite sex. 
xIf applicable, additional contr aception requirements may need t o be followed according 
to local regulations a nd/or requirements. 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 53 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedxMale subjects must not donate sperm  after the first dose of stu dy drug, throughout the 
study, and for 90 days following t he last dose of study drug. 
xFemale subjects and female part ners of male subjects should not  plan to become pregnant 
during the study through 90 days following the last dose of stu dy drug. 
xMale subjects whose female partne r becomes pregnant through well -documented in vitro 
fertilization (donated s perm) or banked sperm (collected before  the subject received study 
drug) must be compliant with the  contraception requirements. In  this scenario, the male 
subject and his female partner m ust commit to using barrier met hods of contraception (to 
ensure there is no exposure of t he fetus to study drug) for the  duration of the study and 
until 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
xFemale subjects should not nurse a c hild from the start of stud y drug dosing through 
90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
xUnique situations that may not fa ll within the above specificat ions should be discussed 
with the medical monitor.
11.7.5.2 Pregnancy
Subjects will be counseled to inf orm the investigator of any pr egnancy that occurs during 
study treatment and within 90 days a fter the last dose of study  drug. 
If a female subject or the femal e partner of a male subject bec omes pregnant while 
participating in the study, stud y drug must be permanently disc ontinued immediately. For 
male subjects, study drug does not  need to be permanently disco ntinued if the female 
partner's pregnancy resulted from donated sperm or sperm banked  before study drug 
exposure ( Section 11.7.5.1 ). The investigator must notify the medical monitor and Vertex 
GPS within 24 hours of the site's  knowledge of the subject's (o r partner's) pregnancy using 
the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. 
If the subject is confirmed t o be on study drug, the subject or  partner will be followed until 
the end of the pregnancy and the  infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided 
informed consent is obtained. A s eparate ICF will be provided t o explain these follow-up 
activities. Pregnancy itsel f does not constitute an AE.
11.7.6 Pulse Oximetry
Arterial oxygen saturation by  pulse oximetry will be measured a t visits noted in Table 3-1
andTable 3-2 . This will be assessed following a  5-minute rest (seated or su pine) and before 
study drug dosing. At visits whe n study drug is taken at the si te, pulse oximetry will be 
collected before the morning dos e. This is a noninvasive measur e of oxygen delivery to the 
tissues and has been correlated w ith clinical status and lung f unction. 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 54 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated11.7.7 Liver Function Test Parameters
Liver Function Testing 
Liver function testing (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, direct bilirubin, a nd total bilirubin) must be 
performed as noted in Table 3-2 for serum chemistry, while subjects are receiving study drug 
treatment and at the Safety Fo llow-up Visit. These blood sample s should be processed and 
shipped immediately per the Laboratory Manual. 
Subjects with new treatment-emerg ent ALT or AST elevations of > 3 × ULN and clinical 
symptoms must be followed close ly, including repeat confirmator y testing performed by the 
central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding  and subsequent close 
monitoring of ALT and AST levels , as clinically indicated. In a ddition, if ALT or AST is 
>5 × ULN, repeat follow-up lev els must be obtained within 7 ± 2  days. 
If a subject cannot return to t he site for liv er function testi ng, a local laboratory may be used. 
Elevations in LFTs at the local  laboratory must be reported imm ediately to the medical 
monitor, and the subject must ha ve the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as 
soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study Drug Interruption
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), 
and the medical monitor must be  notified, if any of the followi ng criteria is met and 
confirmed with repeat testing:
xALT or AST >8 × ULN
xALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
xALT or AST >3 × ULN, in assoc iation with total bilirubin >2 × U LN and/or clinical 
jaundice 
A thorough investigation of pot ential causes should be conducte d, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression. 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use,  viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the elevated tra nsaminases is identified, regard less of whether ALT or AST 
levels have improved, study trea tment must be permanently disco ntinued if repeat testing 
within 48 to 72 hours confirms the  initial elevation. Subjects in whom treatment is 
discontinued for eleva ted transaminases s hould have their trans aminases monitored closely 
until levels normalize  or return to baseline.
Resumption of Study Drug

PD\EHUHVXPHGRQFHWUDQVDPLQDV HVUHWXUQWREDVHOLQHRUDUH  × ULN, whichever is higher. 
Approval of the medical monitor is required before resumption o f study drug. Upon 
resumption of study drug, trans aminases should be assessed week ly for 4 weeks. If a 
protocol-defined transaminase elevation occurs within 4 weeks o f rechallenge with the study 
drug (with confirmati on of the initial elevation by repeat test ing within 48 to 72 hours), then 
the study drug must be permanent ly discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated11.7.8 Ophthalmologic Examination
Subjects will undergo an ophthalmo logic examination performed b y a licensed 
ophthalmologist at screen ing, which includes 
xmeasurement of best corrected di stance visual acuity of each ey e; 
xmeasurement of lens refracting po wer following cycloplegia (e.g ., autorefractor or 
ophthalmoscopy streak); and 
xpharmacologically dilated examin ation of the lens with a slit l amp.
The screening ophthalmologic exa mination must be completed and the results reviewed 
before enrollment. This examin ation does not have to be repeate d if there is documentation 
of an examination that met protocol criteri a and that was withi n 3 months before the start of 
the Screening Period or if ther e is documentation of bilateral lens removal.
If a cataract, lens opacity, Y-sut ure, or lamellar rings are id entified and dete rmined to be 
clinically significant by the opht halmologist at the Screening examination, the subject is 
ineligible for study entry ( Section 9.2 ). If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and 
determined to be  clinically significant by the ophthalmologist after dosing, the subject and 
Vertex medical monitor will be  notified. After discussion with the principal investigator, who 
collaborates with the Vertex me dical monitor, the subject may e lect to continue or 
discontinue study drug treatment . If the subject discontinues s tudy drug treatment, the subject 
should complete the ETT Visit, all subsequent scheduled visits per Table 3-2 , and the Safety 
Follow-up Visit (see Sections 8.1.4 and8.1.5 ). If the subject continues study drug treatment, 
more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered. 
In addition to the Screening Vis it, an ophthalmologic examinati on will be performed by a 
licensed ophthalmologist at the Sa fety Follow-up Visit or ETT V isit for the following 
subjects:
xsubjects <18 years of age at the Screening Visit who discontinue  study drug treatment 
after receiving at least 1 dose of study drug, 
xsubjects <18 years of age at the Screening Visit who complete s tudy drug treatment but 
do not enroll in a separate exte nsion study of VX-661/ivacaftor  within 28 days after the 
last dose of study drug. 
This examination may be complete d at either the ETT Visit or Sa fety Follow-up Visit, but 
must be completed by the date  of the Safety Follow-up Visit.

xRelative change from baseline will be calculated as (postbaseline value - baseline 
value)/baseline value.
The Treatment-emergent (TE) Per iod will be defined separately f or the Ivacaftor Run-in 
Period and the Active Compar ator Treatment Period: 
xThe TE Period for the Ivacaftor Ru n-in Period is defined as the  first dose in the Ivacaftor 
Run-in Period to the earlier of t he last day prior to the first  dose of the Active Comparator 
Treatment Period or either the S afety Follow-up Visit or 28 day s (inclusive) after the last 
dose for subjects who do not have S afety Follow-up Visit in the  Ivacaftor Run-in Period.

The following demographics a nd baseline characteristics will be  summarized: sex, race, 
ethnicity, age, weight, height, BMI, region, baseline percent p redicted FEV 1, baseline sweat 
chloride, and baseline score of C FQ-R respiratory domain. The s ummary will be based on the  
Safety Set for the Ivacaftor Run- in Period. For the Active Compa rator Treatment Period, the 
summary will be based on the FAS.  
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 60 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications
Medications used in this study w ill be coded by using the World  Health Organization-Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categ orized as the following:  
xPrior medication: any medication that started bef ore initial dosing of study drug  in the 
Ivacaftor Run-in Period, re gardless of when it ended. 
xConcomitant medication durin g the Ivacaftor Run-in Period : medication continued 
or newly received at or after in itial dosing of the study drug through the end of the TE 
Period for the Ivacaftor Run-in Period.  
xConcomitant medication during the  Active Comparator Treatment P eriod:
medication continued or newly rec eived at or after initial dosi ng of study drug through 
the end of the TE Period of the Ac tive Comparator Treatment Per iod. 
xPost-treatment medication:  medication continued or newl y received beyond the TE 
Period of the Active Compar ator Treatment Period.
A given medication can be classi fied as a prior medication, a c oncomitant medication 
(concomitant medication during th e Ivacaftor Run-in Period and/ or a concomitant medication 
during the Active Comparator Tr eatment Period), or a post-treat ment medication; both prior 
and concomitant; both c oncomitant and post-treatment; or prior,  concomitant, and post-
treatment. If a medication has a missing or partial missing sta rt/end date or time and cannot 
be determined whether  it was taken before i nitial dosing, conco mitantly, or beyond the TE 
Period, it will be considered a s prior, concomitant, and post-t reatment.
Prior medications and c oncomitant medications in the Ivacaftor Run-in Period will be 
summarized descriptively based on t he Safety Set in that period .  
Prior medications, conc omitant medication in the Ivacaftor Run- in Period will be 
summarized descriptively again ba sed on the FAS for the Active Comparator Treatment 
Period. Concomitant medications in t he Active Comparator Treatm ent Period will also be 
summarized descriptively based on the FAS.  
Post-treatment medications will be listed for each subject.
12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance
Study drug exposure and complia nce will be summarized separatel y for the Ivacaftor Run-in 
Period and Active Comparator Trea tment Period. Exposure to stud y drug (i.e., duration of 
treatment) will be su mmarized for the Safety Set for the Ivacaf tor Run-in Per iod and the FAS 
for the Active Comparator Trea tment Period in terms of duration  of treatment a subject 
received (in days), defined as th e last day minus the first day  of study drug in the 
corresponding treatment period pl us 1, regardless of any interr uptions in dosing. Dosing 
compliance is calculated as the actual number of dosing occasio ns at which study drug was 
administered, as a percentage of  the planned number of dosing o ccasions, for the 
corresponding treatment period. D osing compliance will be summa rized for the Safety Set 
for the Ivacaftor Run-in Peri od and for the FAS f or the Active Comparator Treatment Period. 
Duration of treatment and dosing compliance will be summarized by means of descriptive 
summary statistics.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedxAbsolute change in the CFQ-R respi ratory domain score from basel ine through 
Week 8 in the Active Comp arator Treatment Period: Analysis of this domain will be 
similar to that of the primary analysis of the primary efficacy  endpoint, with the addition 
of the CFQ-R respiratory domain s core at baseline as a covariate .
Adjustment for Mul tiple Comparisons
A hierarchical testing procedur e will be used to control the Ty pe I error for the multiple 
HQGSRLQWVWHVWHGDWĮ  = 0.05. For a test at any step to be considered statistically significant 
within the testing hierarchy, it must be statistically signific ant, and all previous tests (if any) 
within the hierarchy must be sta tistically significant, at the 0.05 level. The testing hierarchy 
is as follows: 
1. Absolute change i n percent predicted FEV 1 from baseline through Week 8 
2. Relative change in percent predicted FEV 1 from baseline through Week 8 
3. Absolute change in CFQ-R res piratory domain score from baseli ne through Week 8 
12.3.3.3 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variables
Absolute change in sweat chlorid e from baseline through Week 8 in the Active 
Comparator Treatment Period : Analysis of this variable w ill be performed using the same 
model as described for the absolu te change in percent predicted  FEV 1 from baseline, with the 
addition of baseline sweat chlor ide value as a covariate.
12.3.4 Safety Analysis
Safety analyses will  be based on the Safety Se t with the associ ated TE Period and separately 
for the Ivacaftor Run-in Peri od and the Active Comparator Treat ment Period, as appropriate. 
The overall safety profile of stu dy drug will be assessed in te rms of the following safety and 
tolerability endpoints: 
xIncidence of treatment-emerg ent adverse event (TEAEs)
xClinical laboratory values (i. e., urinalysis, hematology, serum  chemistry, coagulation 
studies, vitamin levels, lipid panel)
xECGs
xVital signs
xPulse oximetry
xSpirometry
All safety data will be presente d in individual subject data li stings. 
12.3.4.1 Adverse Events
For analysis purposes, AEs will be  classified as  pretreatment A Es, TEAEs during the 
Ivacaftor Run-in Period, TEAEs dur ing the Active Comparator Tre atment Period, or 
post-treatment AEs, de fined as follows: 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 63 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedxPretreatment AE:  any AE that started before ini tial dosing of study drug in the  Ivacaftor 
Run-in Period. 
xTEAEs during the Ivac aftor Run-in Period : any AE that increased in severity or that 
was newly developed at or after  initial dosing of study drug th rough the end of the TE 
Period for the Ivacaftor Run-in Period. 
xTEAEs during the Active Co mparator Treatment Period: any AE that increased in 
severity or that was newly deve loped at or after initial dosing  of study drug through the 
end of the TE Period for  the Active Comparat or Treatment Period . 
xPost-treatment AE: any AE that increased in severit y or that was newly developed 
beyond the TE Period. 
For AEs with missing or partial start dates, if there is no cle ar evidence that the AEs started 
before or after study treatment , then the AEs w ill be classifie d as TEAEs. If there is no clear 
evidence that the AEs started be fore or after the start of the Active Comparator Treatment, 
then the AEs will be c lassified as TEAEs dur ing the Active Comp arator Treatment Period.
AE summary tables will be presen ted for TEAEs, separately for t he Ivacaftor Run-in Period 
and the Active Comparator Trea tment Period, and will include th e following: 
xAll TEAEs

CONSIDERATIONS
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, 
Severity Grading, and Reporting
13.1.1 Adverse Events13.1.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence in a subjec t during the study; the 
event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any 
newly occurring event or worse ning of a preexisting condition ( e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious i f it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1 .
13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments
Study assessments including la boratory tests, ECGs, PEs, pulse oximetry, and vital signs, 
will be assessed and thos e deemed a clinical ly significant wors ening from baseline 
documented as an AE. When possibl e, a clinical diagnosis for th e study assessment will be 
provided, rather than the abnorma l test result alone (e.g., uri nary tract infection, anemia). In 
the absence of a diagnosis, the  abnormal study assessment itsel f will be listed as the AE (e.g., 
bacteria in urine or de creased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study asse ssment is considered clinically significa nt if the subject has 1 or more 
of the following: 
xConcomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study ass essment
xFurther diagnostic testing or med ical/surgical intervention
xA change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whe ther the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant crite ria. The determination of 
whether the study assessment results are clinically significant  will be made by the 
investigator.
A laboratory value that is Grad e 4 will not automatically be an  SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory 
value will be an SAE if the clin ical status of the subject indic ates a life-threatening AE.
13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the  following time points:
xFor subjects who do not enroll: un til time of screen failure (e .g., screen failure, 
withdrawal of consent) 
xFor enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Visit: throug h the Safety Follow-up 
Visit
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 67 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedxFor enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit:  the earliest of
o28 days after the last dose of study drug
oThe ETT Visit, if that visit is 3 w eeks or later following the last dose of study drug 
(Section 8.1.5 )
oprior to the first dose of stu dy drug in the extension study  
All subjects will be queried, us ing non-leading questions, abou t the occurrence of AEs at 
each study visit. When possible , a constellation of signs and/o r symptoms will be identified 
as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the eCRF 
and source document. AEs for s ubjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the 
study will be recorded only in t he subject's source documents. The following data will be 
documented for each AE: 
xDescription of the event 
xClassification of “seri ous” or “nonserious” 
xDate of first occurrence and date  of resolution (if applicable)  
xSeverity
xCausal relationship to study drug(s)  
xAction taken  
xOutcome 
xConcomitant medication or  other treatment given
xIndication of dose limiting toxicity
13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and non-serious AEs. 
The guidance available at the f ollowing website will be consult ed: Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy  Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm (Accessed 
August 2012). AEs of CTCAE Grade s 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” In 
considering the severity of an A E in a pediatric subject, the i nvestigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric c linical laboratory parameters m ay differ from those given in 
the CTCAE. The severity of an A E that does not appear in the CT CAE will be determined 
according to the definitions in Table 13-1 .

Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and  significantly interferes with regular activities
Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities
Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug experience that places the subject, in the vie w of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death
AE: adverse event.
13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality
Every effort will be made by the  investigator to assess the rel ationship of the AE, if any, to 
the study drug(s). Causality w ill be classified using the categ ories presented in Table 13-2.
Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality
Classification Definition
Related There is an association between the event and the administration  of 
investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event  to be related to 
the investigational study drug and causes other than the invest igational study 
drug have been ruled out, and/or the event re-appeared on re-ex posure to the 
investigational study drug.
Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administratio n of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism f or the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be al ternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the s ubject’s clinical status or und erlying disease.
Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational stud y drug and likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational study drug. 
Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigatio nal study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).
AE: adverse event.
13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with  regard to the AE. The action 
taken will be classified accordin g to the categories shown in Table 13-3 . 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 69 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedTable 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Reg ard to an AE 
Classification Definition
Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE.
Dose reduced Not applicable for this study
Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE.
Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE.
Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply . 
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the  investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportu nity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possib le.
AE: adverse event.
13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined an d provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be cla ssified according to the categories show n in Table 13-4.

ongoing
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is a t least possibly 
related to the AE.
Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow-u p)
AE: adverse event.
13.1.1.8 Treatment Given
The investigator ensures adequa te medical care is provided to s ubjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laborato ry values related to study drug.  In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment w as given for the AE. “Yes” is u sed if any treatment was 
given in response to an AE and may i nclude treatments such as o ther medications, 
hospitalization, surgery, or physic al therapy. “No” indicates t he absence of any kind of 
treatment for an AE.
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 70 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:
xFatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participa tion in the study or occurs 
after participation in the stu dy and is suspected of being a de layed toxicity due to 
administration of the study drug) 
xLife-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk o f death from the reaction as 
it occurred 
xInpatient hospitalization or  prolongation of hospitalization 
xPersistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's abilit y to conduct normal life functio ns) 
xCongenital anomaly or birth defect 
xImportant medical event that , based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medi cal or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g., an a llergic bronchospasm requiring intensiv e treatment in an 
emergency room or at home) 
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g. surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject si gned the ICF, and the hospitaliza tion or procedure was planned 
before the subject signed the ICF, the hospita lization or proce dure should not be considered 
to indicate an SAE, unless an A E caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled 
sooner or to be prolonge d relative to what was planned. In addi tion, hospitalizations clearly 
not associated with an AE (e.g ., social hospita lization for pur poses of respite care) should not 
be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be m ade between the terms  “serious” and “sev ere,” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the int ensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or s evere myocardial infarction. T he event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical s ignificance, such as a severe h eadache. This is not the same 
as “serious,” which is based on s ubject/event outcome or action  described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject' s life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining exped ited regulatory reporting 
obligations.  
13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs that occur after obtai ning informed c onsent and assent  (where applicable) through 
the Safety Follow-up Visit, reg ardless of causality, will be re ported by the investigator to 
Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs t hat occur after the Safety F ollow-up Visit and are 
considered related to study drug (s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours .
SAEs will be recorded on the Verte x Organized Safety Informatio n Collection Form 
(hereafter referred to as the “SAE  Form”) using a recognized me dical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. S AEs will be assessed by the inv estigator for relationship to the 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 72 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporatedthe subject (if applicable), befo re study participation. The me thod of obtaining and 
documenting the informed consent and assent (if applicable) and  the contents of the consent 
will comply with ICH GCP and all a pplicable laws and regulation s and will be subject to 
approval by Vertex or its designee. 
13.2.3 Investigator Compliance
No modifications to the protocol  will be made without the appro val of both the investigator 
and Vertex. Changes that signifi cantly affect the safety of the  subjects, the scope of the 
investigation, or the scientific  quality of the study (i.e., ef ficacy assessments) will require 
IRB/IEC notification before imple mentation, except where the mo dification is necessary to 
eliminate an apparent immediate  hazard to human subjects. Verte x will submit all protocol 
modifications to the required regulatory authorities.
When circumstances require an immediate departure from procedur es set forth in the 
protocol, the investigator will c ontact Vertex to discuss the p lanned course of action. If 
possible, contact will be made be fore the implementation of any  changes. Any departures 
from protocol will be fully doc umented in the source documentat ion and in a protocol 
deviation log. 
13.2.4 Access to Records
The investigator will make the o ffice and/or hospital records o f subjects enrolled in this study 
available for inspection by Vertex or its representative at the time of each monitoring visit 
and for audits. The records will also be available for direct i nspection, verification, and 
copying, as required by applicable laws and regulations, by off icials of the regulatory health 
authorities (FDA and others). The  investigator will comply with  applicable privacy and 
security laws for use and disc losure of informa tion related to the research set forth in this 
protocol. 
13.2.5 Subject Privacy
To maintain subject confidentialit y, all electronic case report  forms (eCRFs), study reports, 
and communications relating to t he study will identify subjects  by assigned subject numbers. 
As required by federal regulations, the investigator will allow  Vertex and/or its 
representatives access to all pertinent medical records to allo w for the verification of data 
gathered in the eCRFs/SAE Forms and the review of the data coll ection process. The FDA 
(or other regulatory authority) may also request access to all study records, including source 
documentation, for inspection. 
As applicable, in accordance wit h the Health Insurance Portabil ity and Accountability Act 
and associated privacy regulati ons, a subject authorization to use personally identifiable 
health information may be requi red from each subject before res earch activities begin. This 
authorization document will clear ly specify which parties will have access to a subject's
personal health infor mation, for what purpos e, and for how long . 
13.2.6 Record Retention
The investigator will maintain all study records according to IC H GCP guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requi rement(s), whichever is longes t, as described in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the respons ibility of keeping the study

Vertex will be notified.
13.2.7 Study Termination
At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or  may terminate this study at any 
particular site. In a ddition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRBs/IECs 
may terminate the study at their center.
Conditions that may lead to reas onable cause and warrant termin ation include, but are not 
limited to:
xSubject or investigator noncompliance 
xUnsatisfactory subject enrollment
xLack of adherence to protocol procedures 
xLack of evaluable a nd/or complete data
xPotentially unacceptable risk to study subjects
xDecision to modify drug  development plan 
xDecision by the FDA or other regulatory authority 
Written notification that includes the reason for the clinical study termination is required.
13.3 Data Quality Assurance
Vertex or its designated represe ntative will conduct a study si te visit to verify the 
qualifications of each investigat or, inspect clinical study sit e facilities, and inform the 
investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring ad equate and correct study 
documentation. 
The investigator is required t o prepare and maintain adequate a nd accurate case histories 
designed to record all observa tions and other data pertinent to  the study for each study 
participant. Study data for each  enrolled subject will be enter ed into an eCRF by study site 
personnel using a secure, validat ed web-based electronic data c apture (EDC) application. 
Vertex will have read-only acce ss to site-entered clinical data  in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant , or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator 
for resolution. Any changes to s tudy data will be made to the e CRF and documented in an 
audit trail, which w ill be maintained withi n the clinical datab ase.
13.4 Monitoring
Monitoring and auditing procedur es developed or approved by Ver tex will be followed to 
comply with GCP guidelines. On-s ite checking of the eCRFs/SAE F orms for completeness 
and clarity, cross-checking wit h source documents, and clarific ation of administr ative matters 
will be performed. 
The study will be monitored by Vertex or its designee. Monitori ng will be done by personal 
visits from a representative of  Vertex, or designee (study site  monitor), who will review the 
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 74 of 81
Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedeCRFs/SAE Forms and source docum ents. The study site monitor wi ll ensure that the 
investigation is conducted accordin g to the protocol design and  regulatory requirements. 
13.5 Electronic Data Capture
Vertex will provide the study s ites with secure access to and t raining on the EDC application 
sufficient to permit study site  personnel to enter or correct i nformation in the  eCRFs on the 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
eCRFs will be complet ed for each enrolled study subject. It is the investigator's responsibility 
to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness o f the data reported in the 
subject's eCRFs. Source documen tation supporting the eCRF data will indicate the subject's 
participation in the study and w ill document the dates and deta ils of study procedures, AEs, 
other observations, and subject status.  
The investigator, or designated r epresentative, will complete t he eCRFs as soon as possible 
after information is collected. 
The audit trail entry will show  the user's identification infor mation and the da te and time of 
any correction. The investigator m ust provide for mal approval o f all the information in the 
eCRFs, including any changes ma de to the eCRFs , to endorse the final submitted da ta for the 
subjects for whom the inves tigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the eCRF da ta and corresponding audit trails . A copy of the final archival 
eCRFs in the form of a compact  disc or other electronic media w ill be placed in the 
investigator's study file.

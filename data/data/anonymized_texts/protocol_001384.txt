2)To conduct direct comparisons over time among  
hypoglycem ic agents (linagliptin versus other DPP -4, 
glitazones 2ndgeneration of SUs) and quantify the association 
between hypoglycemic choice and the occurrence of specific 
outcomes of interest.
The primary outcome sof interest will be the occurrence of a 
major ca rdiovascular event (defined as composite of coronary 
revascularization, acute coronary syndrome hospitalization, 
ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke ) and the individual components 
of the composite cardiovascular outcome . Heart failure 
hospitalization , incident end-stage renal disease and acute renal 
failure will be considered secondary outcomes of interest.

Title of study : Active surveillance research program for the assessment of the safety 
and the effectiveness of linagliptin
Rationale and 
background:Dipeptidyl peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors, including linagliptin, 
saxagliptin, alogliptin and sitagliptin, are a new class of oral 
hypoglycemic agents approved in the United States. They are indicated
for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control 
in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Evidence to date 
suggests that these drugs offer advantages over older therapies in that 
they are weight -neutral, are associated with a minimal risk of 
hypoglycemia, and can be administered with once -daily dosing. 
Linagliptin offers a further advantage in that its dose does not need to 
be adjusted based on renal or hepatic function. While there do not 
appear to be contraindications (except for hypersensitivity to the active 
ingredient or any of the excipients) to the use of Linagliptin, the long -
term safety and effectiv eness have not been well characterized.
Given the high prevalence of T2DM, it is important to understand the 
comparative s afety and effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic agents. 
This protocol is for a series of comparative effectiveness and safety 
analyses within periodically updated cohorts of patients initiating 
linagliptin, other DPP -4 inhibitors, and other oral hypoglycemic 
medications, followed longitudinally for the occurrence of a variety of 
health outcomes. The initial analyses will be based on data from May 
2011 through June 2013 and will be sequentially updated every 6 
months through December 2016.
Research question 
and objectives:This protocol is for a series of comparative effectiveness and safety 
analyses within periodically updated cohorts of patients initiating 
linagliptin, other DPP -4 inhibitors, and other oral hypoglycemic 
medications, followed longitudinally for the occurrence of a variety of 
health outcomes.
Objectives :
1.To conduct a multi -year surveillance program that establishes 
and periodically updates initiator cohorts of linagliptin, within -
class comparators (saxagliptin, sitagliptin, alogliptin), and ou t-
of-class comparators (glitazones, 2nd generation of 
sulfonylureas (SUs)), and longitudinally follow them for the 
incidence of a variety of health outcomes (i.e. cardiovascular, 
 renal 
impairment  ).

2.To conduct direct comparisons over time among hypoglycemic 
agents (linagliptin versus other DPP -4 inhibitors, glitazones 
2nd generation of SUs) and quantify the association between 
hypoglycemic choice and the occurrence of specific outcomes 
of interest.
The primary outcomes of interest will be the occurrence of a major 
cardiovascular event (defined as composite of coronary 
revascularization, acute coronary syndrome hospitalization, ischemic 
and hemorrhagic stroke ) and the individual components of t he 
composite cardiovascular outcome. Heart failure hospitalization, 
incident end -stage renal disease and acute renal failure will be 
considered secondary outcomes of interest.  We will use multiple 
comparators because there are several potential treatment alternatives 
to linagliptin for patients with T2DM.
Although linagliptin is the only DPP -4 inhibitor that does not require 
dose adjustment for severe renal impairment, within- class comparators, 
i.e. other dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP -4) inhibitors, are expe cted to 
have utilization patterns similar to linagliptin and to be prescribed to 
patients with similar clinical profile
Out-of-class comparators, i.e. second- generation sulfonylureas and 
pioglitazone, will be considered in order to investigate between -class 
effects. 2nd generation sulfonylureas and glitazones are oral 
hypoglycemics and are not usually used as 1st -line therapy. Therefore, 
they may be more commonly used as an alternative to linagliptin than 
other treatment options such as glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP -1) 
receptor agonists or metformin.  SGLT2 inhibitors will not be included 
as comparators because the first agen t in the class, canagliflozin, was 
not approved until March 2013.  As such most SGLT2 inhibitors will 
be available for less than half the study period and the sample that will 
accumulate will most likely insufficient for powered analysis.
Patients with prior use of a medication within th e same class will be 
excluded from the primary analysis.  We will also conduct a secondary 
analysis including DPP4 initiators with or without prior use of another 
DPP4, pioglitazone users with or without prior rosiglitazone use, and 
2ndgeneration sulfonylurea use with or without prior sulfonylurea use.
Study design: Observational cohort study
Population: Patients ≥18 years old with a recorded diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) who initiated linagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, 
alogliptin, glitazones, or 2ndgeneration sulfonylureas 
(Glipizide,Glimepiride) identified in US health insurance databases
Variables: Pre-specified o utcomes of interest include the following:
Primary outcome: Major adverse cardiovascular event
oCoronary revascularization (elective and non -elective 
procedure)
oAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) hospitalization
oStroke (Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke)
Individual components of the composite major adverse 
cardiovascular event listed ab ove
Secondary outcomes:
Heart failure hospitalization

Data sources: Two United States commercial health insurance databases:
UnitedHealth 2006 through June 2013 and
Marketscan 2006 through June 2013 
both with 6 -month updates through Dec 2016
Data include claims for prescriptions, inpatient and outpatient visits 
and procedures, and insurance plan enrollment information and 
demographics.  Lab test results are available for a subset of the 
population.
Study size: ~ 30,000 linagliptin initiators, with other DPP -4, 2nd generation of 
SUs, Glitazones of ~30,000 each of the comparator groups
Data analysis: For each comparison, study cohorts will be formed by propensity score 
matching within blocks of calendar time.
This study will compare rates of outcomes among patients who initiate 
Linagliptin versus initiators of other DPP -4s, 2nd generation of SUs, 
glitazones. 
 
 
Analyses will account for different follow -up times and censoring.  
 
A total of seven interim analyses will be conducted starting from Jun 
2014.
The final analyses will be based on data from May 2011- Dec 2016 
Patient characteristics will be based on all available information up to 
January 2006.

7. RESEARCH QUESTION AN D OBJECTIVES
This protocol is for a series of comparative effectiveness and safet y analyses within 
periodicall y updated cohorts. The s pecific objectives of this surveillance program are: 
To conduct a multi- year research program that establishes and periodicall y updates 
initiator cohorts of linagliptin, within -class comparators (saxagliptin, sitagliptin, 
alogliptin) , and out -of-class comparators (glitazones or second generation of SUs), 
describes patient characteristics over time, and longitudinally  follows drug initiators for 
the incidence of a variet y of health outcomes (i.e. cardiovascular outcomes, 
 renal impairment ).
To conduct direct comparisons among h ypogl ycemic agents and quantify  the 
association between h ypoglycemic choice and the occurrence of both specific outcomes 
of interest and other outcomes potentially  brought forward during the study period.
The primary outcomes of interest will be the occurrence of a major cardiovascular event (defined as 
composite of coronary revascularization, acute coronary syndrome hospitalization, ischemic and 
hemorrhagic stroke ) and the individual components of the composite cardiovascular outcome. Heart 
failure hospitalization, incident end -stage renal disease and acute renal failure will be considered 
secondary outcomes of interest.  There are no a priori hy potheses.

8.2 SETTING
Initiators of linagliptin and other oral h ypogl ycemic medications from UnitedHealth Research 
Database and MarketScan source data between May  2011 and Jun 2013 , with 6-month updat es 
through December 2016.  
The United Healthcare and Marketscan data were selected as data sources for several reasons.  
These commercial databases involve relativel y short lag -times for inclusion of data so that they  
are more up -to-date than many  alternatives (e.g. Medicare data) and they  provide a fairly  
complete pi cture of interactions between patients and the healthcare s ystem for a large cohort 
of patients.  Further, there is the opportunity  to go bey ond the source data through linkages to 
laboratory  data and electronic medical records. 
Finally , the inclusion of two data sources will increase the size of the elderly  population 
available for the study , since many  patients over the age of 65 transition from commercial 
health insurers to Medicare and are thereb y under -represented in commercial databases.
8.2.1 Subjects
From the UnitedHealth Research Database and MarketScan source data, we will identify  
patients with a recorded diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who initiated linaglip tin, 
sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, pioglitazone, or 2ndgeneration sulfony lureas between May  
2011 and June 2013. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed with the 
goal of obtaining a population that is broadly  representative of patients with T2DM and within 
which valid comparisons can be made due to the se lection of linagliptin users and users of other 
oral glucose medications that are used at similar stages of diabetes.
Inclusion criteria:
Patients ≥18 y ears old
Patients received a dispensing of linagliptin or a comparator h ypogl ycemic (see table 1 ) 
medication within the study  timeframe AND had a diagnosis of T2DM (ICD -9 Dx code 
of 250.x0 or 250.x2) prior to drug initiation.1
We are restricting to initiators with evidence of t ype T2DM in order to exclude 
1 All available data prior to and including the index date will be used to identify the presence of a recorded T2DM 
and T1DM diagnoses

patients receiving non -insulin hypogly cemic agents for other indications (e.g., 
polycystic ovary  syndrome, infertility, weight loss, etc.).
The first dispensing is preceded b y at least 6 months of continuous enrollment in the 
study  database, defined as the routine maximum allowed bridge for administrative gaps 
of enrollment, i.e, <32 day s enrollment gap using the enrollment and disenrollment 
dates.
‘New users’ definition:  The study will focus on “new users”, defined as patients with no 
dispensing of that particular medication in the prior 6 months. The patients will be additionally  
classified in:
“Treatment -naive new users”, defined as patients with no use of any  hypogly cemic 
agent (including insulin) in the prior 6 months,
“non -naive new users”, defined as patients initiating a new h ypogl ycemic agent asa
switch from or addition to 
a previous h ypogl ycem ic medication, will also be 
identi fied and investigated in secondary  anal yses. 
All patients initiating hypogl ycemic drugs will be classified as initiators of a specific 
hypoglycemic drug or class on the basis of the first in time drug initiation within a time -block. 
Patients’ follow -up wi ll terminate at the end of their exposure time window, which will vary  
according to the specific outcome and analy sis as specified in section 8.3 . If the same patient 
re-initiates treatment later on, (s)he may  re-enter the cohor t at that time, but only  in the case 
that the patient was not successfull y matched during the time -block corresponding to his/her 
original drug initiation and meets all inclusion criteria at the time of the matching. Thus, 
patients will contribute only  once to the balanced study  cohort ( Figure 1 ).  Patients with prior 
within -class medication use during the preceding 6 months will be excluded from the primary  
analyses.
Exclusion criteria: 
Patients with missing or ambiguous age or sex information.
Patients under the age of 18
Patients with ty pe 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) defined as at least 1 inpatient or 
outpatient I CD-9 Dx code of 250.x1 or 250.x3 prior to drug initiation1. Although the 
use of oral h ypogl ycemic drugs is a strong p redictor for underly ing T2DM [R12-3697 ], 
it was also decided to exclude the patients with prior recorded diagnosis of T1DM to 
further limit the chances of misclassification of the underl ying disease.
Secondary  diabetes, and gestat ional diabetes in the 6 months prior to drug initiation 
History  of cancer at any  time prior to drug initiation 
End- stage renal disease (ESRD) in the 6 months prior to drug initiation 
HIV diagnosis or treatment at any time prior to drug initiation
Organ transplant at any  time prior to drug initiation

8.2.2 Cohort formation
We will receive new data as they  become available on a periodic basis (every  6 months) and we 
will update the study  cohorts through Dec 201 6. Initiators of linagliptin, and comparator drugs 
identified in each data cut, as previously  described, wi ll form sequential cohorts.  
In each sequential cohort we will balance baseline covariates among patients initiating each 
drug b y means of a multivariate confounder summary  score (b y matching on the exposure 
propensity score). In the primary  as-treated an alysis, patients’ follow -
up will end at treatment 
discontinuation, allowing a grace period, as specified in table 4 . If the same patient re -initiates 
treatment later on after a treatment gap of ≥6 months , (s)he may  re-enter the cohort at that time, 
but only  in case the patient was not successfull y matched during the time -block corresponding 
to his/her original drug initiation ( Figure 1 ).

inhibitors are expected to have utilization patterns more similar to linagliptin than out of class 
comparators and to be prescribed to patients with similar clinical profiles.
Out-of-class comparators, i.e . second -generation sulfony lureas and pioglitazone, will be 
considered in order to investigate between- class effects. 2ndgeneration sulfony lureas and 
thiazolidinediones are oral hy poglycemics and are not usually  used as first- line therap y, so that 
they represent more similarly -used alternatives to linagliptin than other treatment options such 
as glucagon- like peptide -1 (GL P-1) receptor agonists or metformin.   SGLT2 inhibitors will not be 
included as comparators because the first agent in the class, canagliflozin, was not approved until March 
2013.  As such most SGLT2 inhibitors will be available for less than half the study period and the 
sample that will accumulate will most likely be insufficient for powered analysis.
Study follow
-up
The primary analyse swill use an “as treated” approach (AT). Because of the considerable 
difference in the underl ying biology  of the outcomes considered in this research program, 
different definitions for the exposure risk window [R13-1120 ]will be explored for each 
outcome ( Table 4 ). Separately  for each outcome, follow -up will start the day after the initiation 
of linagliptin or a comparator and will end at one of the following (whichever comes first):
Drug discontinuation ( date of last dispensing + day s suppl y + grace period). The grace 
period is a time period after exposure end during which observed outcomes are still 
attribut edto the exposure. Grace period will vary  according to the specific outcome.
Drug augmentation or switching to a comparator 
A study  outcome
End of continuous enrollment, i.e. an enrollment gap of ≥32 day s
Death from an y cause
End of the observation period. According to the specific outcome, the observation 
period may  use all the available data or end at a pre -specified date.
 switching of exposure is handled b y the AT approach.   
 
To account for switching of exposure we will use a modified AT approach, with a latency  
period of 90 day s.  To address potential cumulative dose effects, we will conduct further 
analyses that stratify the AT and ITT anal yses for duration of follow -up.  Strata will be 
determined empir ically ,using 6 months blocks if feasible.

1The grace period is a time period after exposure end during which observed outcomes are still attributed to the exposure.
Secondary  anal yses will use an “intention -to-treat” (ITT) approach (first exposure carried 
forward). Separatel y for each outcome, follow -up will start the day  after the initiation of 
linagliptin or a comparator and will end at one of the following (whichever comes first):
A study  outcome
End of continuous enrollment
Death from an y cause
End of t he observation period. According to the specific outcome, the observation 
period may  use all the available data or end at a pre -specified date.

explored in the I TT ana lyses for each outcome ( Table 5 ).

8.3.3 Covariates
Covariates describing demographics and healthcare characteristics will be assessed on the basis 
of enrollment information and claims over the 6 months (183 day s) preceding (and including 
date of) dispensing. 
All available data prior to and including the i ndex date might be used to identify  selected 
covariates (e.g. history  of diabetes). Unless specified otherwise, covariates are based on 1 in -or 
outpatient diagnosis in any position, since we strive for high sensitivity  for covariate 
definitions.  A comple te list is provided in Annex 3.
8.4 DATA SOURCES
The data source for this project will be a combination of claims data from United Healthcare, a 
large national commercial health insurer, and MarketScan, a research claims database from
commercial emplo yer-sponsored health plans from January  2006 through June 2013, with 6-
month updates through Dec 201 6. Because of a 6- month time lag before data become available, 
we will not have access to any  information bey ond June 2013 for the first interim report. Both 
data sources include meaningful numbers of older adults 65 y ears and older in Medicare 
Advantage plans, employer -sponsored plans covering seniors, and Medicare supplemental 
insurance plans, although it is important to note that elderl y patients with Medicare Advantage 
might differ from the elderly  patients with other ty pes of Medicare coverage as they  tend to be 
healthier and more likely to still be employ ed. These data sources readily  allow for the 
identification of large numbers of expo sed patients with a 6-
month lag time from the 
occurrence of the service (medication dispensing) and availability  of the claims for research.  
They  are further suitable as a foundation for related projects that serve to describe additional 
features of the e xposures, outcomes or covariates through sampled medical record review.  
Both data sources provide outpatient laboratory  results data for about 20 -30% of enrollees.  
We have obtained the following preliminary estimates from the UnitedHealth and MarketSca n 
databases regarding the number of patients initiating DPP4 inhibitors (new users) and meeting 
the main study  selection criteria in the period May 2011 –December 2012.

8.5 STUDY SIZE
The ability  of this research program to detect a given risk increase depends on the incidence of 
the outcome as well as the number of cohort entrants and duration of follow -up.  The table 
below provides estimates of the minimum relative rates that can be detected with 80% power 
for the major stud y outcomes under specific assumptions regarding their incidence in the 
comparator group (labeled “base rate”) and the accrual of person -time.  The base case 
incidence rates were derived from the literature.  We conservativel y assumed that the number 
of patients initiati ng linagliptin each month during 2013 - 2016 is equal to the average monthly  
number of initiators during the last half of 2012, that these patients are matched 1:1 to 
comparator patients, and that each patient contributes 6 months of follow -up time.  Becau se of 
the large numbers of patients initiating comparator agents, we assumed that all linagliptin 
patients will be matched.  The calculations assume an alpha level of 0.05 and a 2- sided test and 
are based on methods b y Peterson and George. [R14-
1502 ]  For the purposes of this table, we
have not applied an alpha spending function or an y other alpha -adjustment to reflect multiple 
testing. 
1New  users are defined as patients with no dispensing of that particular medic ation in the prior 6 months.

8.6 DATA MANAGEMENT
The data will reside on a Linux -based computer cluster in Partners Healthcare’s state -of-the-
art computing facility  located in a secure location in the Boston area. This facility  houses 
clinical sy stems and electronic medical records for Partners hospitals , including Brigham and 
Women’s and Massachusetts General Hospitals.  Entry into the computer room requires 
passing through staffed building securit y, a successful palm scan, and then passing through 
staffed computer room security .  All entries and exits a re logged.  We maintain 26 TB of 
redundant NetApp storage for maximal data integrity  and high -speed data access.  We also 
maintain 96 TB of database storage on a Netezza parallel supercomputer. The computers and 
data files are onl y accessible via a local a rea network, which is overseen b y Partners 
Healthcare Information Securit y, who applies the same standards used for the hospital’s 
electronic medical records sy stems to the research team’s data. All data are transmitted to 
programmers’ workstations in an e ncrypted state. Backups are created using 256 -bit AES 
encry ption, the current Department of Defense standard for data security , and are stored in a 
locked facility .
8.7 DATA ANALYSIS
The anal yses will be based on data from May  2011- December 2016. 
The first data cut will include data between May  2011 and June 2013. 
We will receive new data as they  become available on a periodic basis (every  6 months) and, 
at each data cut, we will update the original set of data, form sequential cohorts by  propensi ty 
score (PS) matching within 6 -month blocks of time, follow patients for each of the outcomes 
of interest in a prospective manner, and estimate measures of effect using person- time based 
analyses among patients who initiate linagliptin versus a comparator drug (Figure 2).  Thus 
each anal ysis will include all patients initiating medication between May  2011 and the end of 
the data cut for that anal ysis.

8.7.1 Main Analysis
We will compare distributions of socio- demographic, clinical and utilization characteristics 
among initiators of different hy poglycemic agents, and describe changes over time with 
respect to these features in a way  that will illustrate the potential for change in channelling 
over time. We will calculate event rates during follow -up for each of the specified outcomes 
in each exposure group of interest .
Unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (hazard ratios) and rate differences will be estimated. 
In adjusted anal yses, we will use propensity  score (PS) matching to balance potential 
confounders. [R13-1120 ] [R12-1912 ] PS will be derived from predicted probabilities of 
treatment initiation estimated in logistic regression models, and will be progressivel y enriched 
by the information obtained through an ongoing drug uilization study  (BI Study  No. 
1218.161) and a stud y assessing the impact of unmeasured confounding ( BIStudy  No. 
1218.162). Thepropensity  score will be used to match linagliptin initiators to initiators of 
other drug comparators on a 1:1 fixed ratio basis using a nearest- neighbor algorithm.  
Individual covariates will be tabulated and compared across matched cohorts. 
In additio
n, we will evaluate the balance across matched cohorts on the basis of empirical or 
established disease risk scores for selected study  outcomes. [R13-0523 ]Linagli ptin

We will plot Kaplan -Meier curves for event -free survival and 95% confidence intervals as a 
function of the duration of use of the index hy pogly cemic agent after mutivariate PS
matching. 
In addition to using propensity  scores developed on the basis of investigator -identified 
covariates, we will use high -dimensional propensity  scores (hdPS) in confirmatory anal yses. 
The hdPS algorithm evaluates thousands of diagnoses, procedures, and pharmacy  claim codes 
to identify  and prioritize those covariates that serve as proxies for unmeasured confounders.  
These empirically  identified co nfounders are combined with investigator- identified covariates 
to improve confounding adjustment.  HdPS approaches have been shown to improve validity  
in longitudinal claims data studies, particularl y when combined with pre -specified covariates.

8.7.3 Bias
Various design and anal ysis methods will be implemented to reduce the potential for bias in 
the study .  
We will employ  new -user cohorts of linagliptin and comparator medications in order to 
address differences that might arise in the comparison of newer a nd older treatments, such as 
survivor bias and attrition of susceptibles.  
The comparator cohorts will be formed based on medications with similar clinical use profiles 
to linagliptin to reduce confounding b y indications.  
We will employ  propensity  score matching of linagliptin and comparator cohorts in order to 
improve the balance of the cohorts with respect to numerous variables.  
1 The Cockroft -Gault formula cannot be used since information on body weight and race is no t available in 
United Healthcare or Marketscan data [R96-0690 ]
We will use established algorithms for outcome identification and onl y outcomes expected to 
be ascertained well in insurance claims. The stud y assessing unmeasured c onfounding ( BI 
Study  No. 1218.162) will further inform the surveillance program regarding the potential for 
unmeasured confounding associated with the use of administrative claims databases, which 
have missing information on important confounders, such as body  mass index, smoking, etc..
8.8 QUALITY CONTROL
All aspects of data anal ysis will be conducted according to standard procedures of the 
Division of Pharmacoepidemiology. Programming for this project will be conducted by  a 
primary  anal yst and validated by  aseparate anal yst (validation anal yst).  For all data 
processing and anal ysis steps, the validation analyst will review the program along with input 
and output data sets, and for select steps of the project will employ  double programming 
techniques to redu ce the potential for programming errors.
8.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METH ODS
As an observational study, there are inherent limitations with respect to potential for alternate 
explanations for any observed association.
The source claims data include limit ations with respect to certainty  of the capture of exposure, 
covariates, and outcomes.  As a comprehensive insurance database, essentially  all billable 
medical services will result in claims for reimbursement, so that the certainty  of capture is tied 
to likelihood of a claim being submitted to the insurer.

Although duration of diabetes may  represent a risk factor for study  outcomes, this covariate 
will be incompletely  captured since the patient history  in the dataset is relatively  short (at least 
6 months, and an average of approximately  2 years), and a first claim within the database may  
not represent diabetes onset since the condition can be latent for some time and is ty picall y 
not treated with h ypoglycemic medications at its diagnosis.
There is potenti al for misclassification of dose based on healthcare utilization data, but the 
“day s supply ” field is expected to be fairl y accurate.
New initiators are operationally  defined as patients with no use in the prior 6 months. This 
does not ensure, however, th at patients have never used the drug of interest; the possibility  
remains that these patients were treated at some prior time point before they enrolled in their 
insurance plan.
Medication use in United/MarketScan data - as in all administrative healthcare databases -is 
restricted to prescription drug medication. Consequently , the use of over -the-counter (OTC) 
medications (e.g., OTC aspirin) is not captured. 
Although both data United Healthcare and MarketScan databases include meaningful 
numbers of older adults 65 y ears and older in Medicare Advantage plans, employ er-sponsored 
plans covering seniors, and Medicare supplemental insurance plans, elderly  with Medicare 
Advantage might differ from the elderl y with other types of Medicare coverage as they  tend to
be healthier and more likely  to still be employ ed.

ANNEX 2. ENCEPP CECK LIST FOR STUDY PROTO COLS
Doc.Ref. EMA/540136/2009 
ENCePP Checklist for Study Protocols (Revision 2 , amended )
Adopted by the ENCePP Steering Group on 14/01/201 3
The European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP)
welcomes innovative designs and new methods of research. This Checklist has been developed by 
ENCePP to stimulate consideration of important principles when designing and writing a 
pharmacoepidemiological or pharmacovigilance study protocol. The Checklist is intended to 
promote the quality of such studies, not their uniformity. The user is also referred to the ENCePP 
Guide on Methodological Standards in Pharmacoepidemiology which reviews and gives direct 
electronic access to guidance for research in pharma coepidemiology and pharmacovigilance.
For each question of the Checklist, the investigator should indicate whether or not it has been 
addressed in the study protocol. If the answer is “Yes”, the page number(s) of the protocol where 
this issue has been dis cussed should be specified. It is possible that some questions do not apply to 
a particular study (for example in the case of an innovative study design). In this case, the answer 
‘N/A’ (Not Applicable) can be checked and the “Comments” field included for each section should be 
used to explain why. The “Comments” field can also be used to elaborate on a “No” answer. 
This Checklist should be included as an Annex by marketing authorisation holders when submitting 
the protocol of a non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) to a regulatory 
authority (see the Guidance on the format and content of the protocol of non-interventional post-
authorisation safety studies ). Note, the Checklist is a supporting document and does not replace 
the format of the protocol for PASS as recommended in the Guidance and Module VIII of the Good 
pharmacovigilance practices (GVP).

ANNEX 3.3GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2  
THERAPY
Insulin secretagogues, biguanides, alpha -glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, GL P-1 
receptor agonists, DPP -IV inhibitors, and insulin are approved for monotherap y of t ype 2 
DM.
Unless contraindicated, metformin is generall y recommended as initial therapy  because of its 
efficacy , known side- effect profile, and relativel y low cost. Metformin has also the advantage 
that it promotes mild weight loss, lowers insulin levels, and improves the lipid profile slightly.
However, due to the paucity  of long -term comparative effectiveness trials available, uniform 
recommendations on the best agent to be combined with metformin cannot be made. 
Advantages and disadvantages of specific drugs for each patient should be considered.

1stUse Agents 2ndUse Agents
If HbA1c > 7% after 2 -3 months3rdUse agents
If HbA1c > 7% after 
2-3 months
Metformin (added at, or
soon after, diagnosis)
If metformin is contraindicated1:
-sulfonylureas (Cheap, generally well -
tolerated)/meglitinides (considered in 
place of a sulfonylurea in patients with 
irregular meal schedules or w ith late 
postprandial hypoglycemia while on 
sulfonylurea agents)
-TZDs (No hypoglycemia)
-DPP-4 inhibitors (No weight gain, no 
hypoglycemia)
-GLP -1 receptor agonists where w eight 
loss is seen as an essential aspect of 
therapy
-AGIs, colesevelam, bromocriptine, 
where available in selected patients, but 
their modest glycemic effects and side 
effect profiles make them less attractive 
candidates
Specific patient preferences, 
characteristics, susceptibilities to side 
effects, potential for w eight gain and 
hypoglycaemia should play a major role 
in this drug selection
If markedly symptomatic patient and/or 
elevated blood glucose levels ( FPG 
>11.1 –13.9 mmol/L or 200 –250 mg/dL) 
or HbA1C (>9.0%):
-Insulin with or without additional 
agents (starting with basal/intermediate 
insulin2(insulin glargine, insulin 
detemir, or NPH insulin))-sulfonylureas/meglitinides 
-TZDs 
-DPP-4 inhibitors
-GLP -1 receptor agonists 
-AGIs, colesevelam, bromocriptine 
(can be added but their modest 
glycemic effects and side effect 
profiles make them less attractive 
candidates)
No good evidence supports one 
combination therapy over another.
If markedly sympt omatic patient and/or 
elevated blood glucose levels or 
HbA1C (>9%):
-basal insulin 
If already on basal insulin, 
intensification of insulin regimen with:
-addition of pre -meal rapid -acting 
insulin analogue
-twice daily pre -mixed insulin (fixed 
combinat ion of an intermediate insulin 
with regular insulin or a rapid 
analogue)Some studies have 
shown advantages of 
adding a third non -
insulin agent 
(sulfonylureas/meglitin
ides, TZDs, DPP -4 
inhibitors, GLP -1 
receptor agonists) to a 
two-drug combination 
that is not yet or no 
longer achieving the 
glycemic target.
How ever at this 
juncture, the most 
robust response will 
usually be w ith insulin, 
especially with 
elevated HbA1C 
(>9%). 
Metformin is often 
continued when basal 
insulin is added (less 
weight gain when the 
two are used together). 
Sulfonylureas/meglitini
des should be avoided 
once more complex 
insulin regimens than 
basal insulin are used.
TZDs should be 
reduced in dose (or 
stopped) to avoid 
edema and excessive 
weight gain (in certain 
individuals with large 
insulin requirements 
from severe insulin 
resistance, these 
insulin sensitizers may 
be very helpful in 
lowering HbA1c and 
minimising the 
required insulin dose).

Treatment algorithm for diabetes mellitus type 2 treatment (con’t)
Com bination of basal 
insulin with GLP -1 
receptor agonists may 
be helpful in some 
patients. 
1Metformin is contraindicated in patients at risk of lactic acidosis such as those with significant renal dysfunction (e.g., 
serum creatinine values >1.5 mg/dL [m ales] and >1.4 mg/dL [females]) or alcoholism. Metformin should be used 
with caution for patients with conditions that predispose them to risk of hypoxia (congestive heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease or obstructive sleep apnea), liver dy sfunction, and age > 80 years (because of the 
decline in renal function).
2At any stage insulin therapy can be augmented with human amylin analogs (pramlintide)

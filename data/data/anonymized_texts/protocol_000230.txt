PRÉCIS  
Background   
• T-cell receptor alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is expressed by both normal and 
malignant prostate cancer ti ssue and is found in about 95% of prostate cancer specimens. 
TARP is immunogenic and hence is a target antigen for vaccination.  
• The immunogenicity of TARP peptides can be augmented through epitope enhancement that 
is achieved through amino acid substitutio ns resulting in increased peptide binding affinity.  
• Two HLA -A*0201 TARP peptide epitopes are associated with generation of catalytic T -cell 
responses: TARP27 -35 and TARP29 -37. Substitution of Val for Leu at position 9 in 
TARP29 -37, results in a peptide wit h increased binding affinity (TARP29 -37-9V) that 
induces antigen specific T cells able to recognize wild type and multiple modified TARP 
peptides. The affinity of the TARP 27 -35 peptide, corresponding to a distinct but overlapping 
epitope, is high enough t hat no enhancement was required.  
• Stage D0 prostate cancer patients have no evidence of visceral or bony metastatic disease but 
have persistently elevated or rising PSA levels (biochemical progression) and are at 
increased risk for disease progression.  Sin ce they lack much of the immune dysfunction 
associated with the high tumor burden characteristic of end -stage metastatic disease, they are 
an ideal population in which to study therapeutic vaccination to slow or prevent disease 
recurrence and progression.  
• Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen -presenting cells of the immune system and 
are being studied extensively for anti -tumor activity in a broad spectrum of cancer patients.  
• As the optimal method for therapeutic immunization with peptide vaccine s in patients with 
cancer is unclear, vaccination with TARP peptides in Montanide® ISA 51 VG adjuvant plus 
Sargramostim will be studied in a randomized fashion with autologous, TARP peptide -
pulsed DCs in HLA -A*0201 Stage D0 prostate cancer patients.   
 
Objectives  
• Determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide and TARP peptide -pulsed dendritic cell  
vaccination in patients with Stage D0 prostate cancer.  
• Determine the T -lymphocyte immune responses to  TARP peptide vaccination with 
Montanide® ISA 51 VG plus S argramostim or autologous dendritic cells as measured by 
tetramer staining, IFN - ELISPOT and 51Cr release CTL assays.  
 
Eligibility  
• Males > 18 years of age with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

brachytherapy, cryotherapy or radiotherapy) for the primary tumor, or other definitive -intent 
local therapy.  
• Stage D0 disease with documented biochemical progression documented by rising PSA and

guidelines).  
• Non-castrate level of testosterone: > 50 ng/dL (prio r ADT allowed; must be > 6 months since 
last dose of ADT).  
• HLA -A*0201 positive.  
• Performance Status: ECOG 0 -2 or Karnofsky 70 -100% and life expectancy > 1 year.

platelet count > 100,000/mm3, and PT/PTT < 1.5X ULN unless receiving clinically indicated 
anticoagulant therapy; SGPT/SGOT < 2.5X ULN, total bilirubin < 1.5X ULN; creatinine < 
1.5X ULN and estimated GFR (eGFR) > 60 ml/min.  
• Hepatitis B and C negative (unless the result is consi stent with prior vaccination or prior 
infection with full recovery); HIV negative.  
• No use of investigational agents within 4 weeks of study enrollment or use of 
immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents within 8 weeks of study entry.  
• No other concurrent  anticancer therapy or prior prostate cancer vaccines expressing TARP or 
HLA A2.  
• No alternative medications known to alter PSA (e.g. phytoestrogens and saw palmetto).  
Note: patients receiving medications for urinary symptoms such as Flomax or 5 -alpha 
reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) on a chronic stable dose for at least 3 
months are allowed .  
 
Study Design  
• This is a randomized, prospective, pilot study of vaccination with a mixture of wild type 
(TARP27 -35) and epitope -enhanced (TARP29 -37-9V) TARP peptides in HLA -A*0201 
patients with stage D0 prostate cancer.  
• Vaccination with TARP peptides admixed with Montanide® ISA 51 VG  plus Sargramostim 
administered by deep subcutaneous injection will be compared with vaccination with TARP 
peptide -pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs) administered intradermally.  
• Autologous dendritic cells will be matured from peripheral blood monocytes with 
Sargramostim, IL -4, IFN - and LPS and pulsed with wild type and epitope -enhanced TARP 
peptides.  
• Apheresis will b e performed on all patients at weeks 0, 24, and 48.  
• Randomization and assignment to received TARP peptide vaccine with Montanide® ISA 51 
VG  plus Sargramostimgiven by deep subcutaneous injection or TARP peptide -pulsed 
autologous DCs given ID will be perfor med at week 0.

 -4- • All patients will receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist ) when seasonally 
available at the very end of their week 0 visit as a control vaccine to assess cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte responses.  
• TARP Peptide vaccines will be administer ed every three weeks at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, 
with a sixth and seventh booster dose of vaccine at Week 48 and 96.  Follow -up will be 
through 144 weeks on study.  
• The trial uses an optimal 2 -stage design targeting an immunologic response between 10 and 
40%.  We will initially accrue 9 patients in each arm.  If 0 -1 patients develop an 
immunologic response, then no further patients will be enrolled.  If 2 or more of these 
patients develop an immunologic response, we will accrue 11 additional patients for a  
maximum total of up to 20 patients in each arm. A stopping rule for excessive toxicity will 
be incorporated.

1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objectives   
1.1.1.1  Determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide and TARP peptide -pulsed dendritic 
cell vacc ination in patients with Stage D0 prostate cancer naïve to androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT).  
1.1.1.2  Determine the T -lymphocyte immune responses to TARP peptide vaccination with 
Montanide® ISA 51 VG plus GM -CSF or autologous dendritic cells as measured by 
tetram er staining, IFN - ELISPOT and 51Cr release CTL assays.  
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives   
1.1.2.1  Determine the effect of TARP peptide vaccination on serum prostate specific antigen 
doubling time (PSADT).  
1.1.2.2  Determine the effect of TARP peptide vaccination on PSA growth rate a nd regression 
rate constants.  
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Peptide Vaccines  
Elucidation of the crystal structure of the MHC and of the peptides bound 1 , and discovery of 
anchor-residue sequence motifs accounting for binding specificity of peptides to MHC 
molecules2 provided the visual and m echanistic answer to how T cells recognize antigens in the 
form of short peptides. The observation that short peptide segments (8 -10 amino acids) fit into a 
groove in the MHC molecule, combined with knowledge of the amino acid sequences of tumor 
epitopes, prompted the use of peptides as therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer. These 
observations were followed by cloning of the first human tumor associated antigen and 
identification of its nonamer peptide sequence 3. Several s trategies have been developed both to 
improve immunogenicity and to steer the immune system toward desired types of responses. 
Peptides have been administered loaded on autologous DCs in an attempt to enhance their 
immunogenicity and improve on peptide vac cination efficacy. However, individual peptides will 
each be useful only in patients with appropriate HLA molecules presenting that peptide.  
In a study of vaccination with p53 peptide -pulsed dendritic cells in HLA -A2+ patients with 
progressive advanced bre ast cancer, a significant fraction of breast cancer patients (8/19 
evaluable patients) obtained stable disease (SD) or minor regression4.  The effect of p53 -specific 
immune therapy was supported by: positive correlation between p53 expression of tumor and 
observed SD; therapy –induced p53 specific T cells in 4/7 patients with SD but only 2/9 patients 
with PD; and significant response - associated changes in serum YKL -40 and IL -6 levels.  In a 
trial of patients with metastatic melanoma vaccinated with melanoma  peptide -pulsed DCs, 
longer survival was associated with induction of melanoma peptide -specific immunity to at least 
two of the four melanoma peptides (MART -1/MelanA, tyrosinase, MAGE -3, and gp100) used in 
the vaccine5.  Similarly, in a phase I study of HL A-A2-bindingMUC1 peptide pulsed DC 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -8- vaccination in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, development of MUC1 peptide -
specific T -cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was seen in the six (of twenty) 
patients with objective responses6.  Consistent with the observed correlations between induction 
of peptide -specific immune responses following DC vaccination and clinical outcomes is a trial 
of CA9 -peptide -pulsed mature dendritic cells in patients with renal carcinoma7: none of the 
immunom onitoring assays documented evidence of CA9 -peptide -specific immunity and no 
clinical responses were observed.  
1.2.2 Epitope Enhancement  
Modification of the amino acid sequence of epitopes, commonly referred to as epitope 
enhancement, can improve the efficacy o f vaccines through several means: 1) increasing affinity 
of peptide for MHC molecules 8-10, 2) increasing T cell receptor (TCR) triggering 11-13, or 3) 
inhibiting p roteolysis of the peptide by serum peptidases 8,14,15.  Whenever the peptide sequence 
is altered, it is important to demonstrate that the T cells induced still recognize the native peptide 
sequence.   There is precedent for epitope -enhanced peptides showing greater efficacy in clinical 
trials10. Epitope -enhanced subdominant peptides can bypass self tolerance because subdominant 
epitopes do not generally induce tolerance but can be made more immunogeni c by epitope 
enhancement16. 
1.2.3 Clinical Trials of Peptide Vaccines  
The best -studied clinical model of peptide vaccination is malignant melanoma.  Rosenberg and 
colleagues evaluated vaccination with native gp100 peptide 209 -217 and found that it produced 
only low levels of T cell reactivity in 2 of 8 melanoma patients analyzed whereas an epitope -
enhanced gp100 (209 -2M) peptide generated strong T cell reactivity in 10 of 11 patients 
immunized 10.  Nevertheless, only a single objective clinical response was repo rted.   
Immunization with the epitope -enhanced peptide, 209 -2M, combined with high dose IL -2 
treatment, produced objective clinical anti -tumor responses in 42% of patients, although T cell 
reactivity was observed in <10% of patients. In the adjuvant settin g, Smith et al. 17 found a 
vaccination frequency of every two or three weeks resulted in a median frequency of CD8+ cells 
binding 209 -2M tetramers of 0.34% after 6 months compared with 0.02% bef ore vaccination, 
whereas less frequent vaccination gave substantially lower responses of 0.03%. The impact of 
age was striking.  In patients under 60 years old the median number of tetramer positive CD8+ 
cells induced by vaccination was 0.64%, whereas in t hose over 60 it was 0.08%.  In other studies 
using this peptide, addition of either IL -12 18 or GM -CSF 19 increased this  percentage slightly.    
Immunization with tyrosinase peptide has been significantly less effective despite epitope 
enhancement. Immunization with the tyrosinase 370D peptide in Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant 
with or without cytokines, including IL -12 18  or GM -CSF 19, only rarely resulted in low numbers 
of tetramer positive CD8 cells or cytokine production. The levels of 370 D-responsive cells has 
been low (0.01 -0.03% of input cells) by ELISPOT assay 20.  The use of peptide vaccines may be 
additionally complicated by the choice of adjuvants.  Most studies used IFA but Schaed et al.20 
showed no response with 370D peptide in IFA, whereas almost 50% of patients show ed low -
level ELIPSOT responses with QS21 or GM -CSF as adjuvants.  
Recent peptide -pulsed DC -based vaccines have yielded more promising and clinically significant 
results against a variety of tumors when associated with the induction of peptide specific 
immu ne responses and include: disease stabilization in pts with p53 expressing advanced breast 
cancer4; prolonged survival in subsets of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -9- vaccinated with melanoma peptides5; and objective responses and disease stabili zation in 
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma6.  In addition, HER2/ neu peptide vaccination alone 
has been associated with reduced recurrence rates in disease -free, conventionally treated, high -
risk breast cancer patients21.  These results must be  balanced against clinical trials with negative 
outcomes: a trial of CA9 -peptide -pulsed mature dendritic cells failed to show any clinical benefit 
in patients with progressive renal cell carcinoma7, while a randomized trial of autologous DC 
vaccines pulsed  with MHC class I and II -restricted peptides could not be demonstrated to be 
more effective than dacarbazine (DTIC) in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma22.  These 
contrasting outcomes reflect the evolving understanding of dendritic cell biology an d delivery, a 
refinement of tumor antigens and peptides selected, and the optimization of patient populations 
that are candidates for therapeutic dendritic cell vaccination.  
The importance of epitope enhancement is supported by the promising results of vac cination 
with the epitope enhanced carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) peptide13, using peptide -pulsed 
FLT3 ligand -expanded DCs to immunize patients with advanced colorectal cancer.  Five of 12 
patients immunized developed > 1% tetramer -positive CD8+ T cells an d two had clinical 
responses.  
Despite the small sample sizes and the variable populations treated, some principles emerge.  
Immunization with native peptide sequences is often insufficient to generate reactive T cells and 
clinical responses in most patien ts.  Epitope -enhanced peptides can generate T cell responses, 
but not always clinical tumor responses. Adjuvants, including cytokines and costimulatory 
molecules, improve the immunogencity of peptide vaccination.  Paradoxically, combining 
peptide vaccinati on with IL -2 significantly reduced detection of specific T cells in blood, but 
nearly half the patients showed objective cancer regressions10, possibly due to IL -2-induced 
innate immunity combined with vaccine immunity.  In addition, preclinical studies in dicate that 
high avidity CTL to self -peptides tumor antigens may be deleted by self tolerance 16.  Epitope 
enhan cement of subdominant epitopes allows induction of protective high avidity CTL responses 
to these tumor antigen epitopes that are not limited by self -tolerance.  This provides an important 
rationale for use of epitope enhanced peptides.  
1.2.4 Previous Vaccine Br anch Studies of Peptide -Pulsed Dendritic Cells  
Although there has been significant progress in the development of peptide vaccines for the 
treatment of melanoma, for other solid malignancies progress has lagged.  We have evaluated 
mutated ras and p53 pepti des in patients with lung and colon cancer.   
In study 94 -C-0031, a phase I/II trial of mutant ras and p53 peptides in a variety of cancers, both 
CTL responses and interferon -gamma responses to the peptide vaccine were statistically 
significantly correlate d with median survival times (393 vs 98 days, p = 0.04, and 470 vs 88 
days, p = 0.02, for the two types of immune response, respectively)23. 
In study 99 -C-0023, a phase I/II trial of vaccination with mutant Ras peptide -pulsed DCs in HLA 
A2.1 patients with colorectal cancer, two groups of patients were eligible for study participation: 
patients with evidence of metastatic disease and patients without evidence of disease but at high 
risk for recurrence.  One of 15 patients enrolled in the metastatic arm devel oped a detectable 
immunologic response but there were no objective tumor responses, although occasional patients 
showed regression of individual metastatic lesions.  There were no immunologic responses 
among the four patients accrued to the adjuvant arm wi thout metastatic disease.  
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -10- In study 99 -C-0142, a phase II trial of individualized mutant p53 peptide -pulsed DCs in the 
treatment of patients with locally advanced non -small cell lung cancer after standard therapy, 
twelve patients were screened for the study  and two patients were eligible for enrollment.  Of the 
two patients enrolled, only one was evaluable for immune responses to p53 vaccination and there 
was no evidence of vaccine -induced immunologic reactivity.  The other patient experienced 
rapid disease progression following completion of vaccination and could not be evaluated for 
immune response.  
These trials of peptide -pulsed dendritic cells were not successful in demonstrating an acceptable 
level of immunization with mutated ras or p53.  This may be du e to the relatively low binding 
affinity of the mutated  ras peptides for HLA -A*0201; successful immunization of patients with 
peptides appears to require epitope -enhanced peptides as discussed earlier.  Another challenge 
that has made use of ras and p53 pe ptides particularly difficult is the need to treat patients whose 
tumor cells express the mutated sequences for this approach to be beneficial.  Only one in three 
patients screened for eligibility for the ras trial was eligible, increasing the amount of sc reening 
required to identify potential candidates.  In addition, in both these studies, the dendritic cell 
vaccines were administered intravenously.  It has become clear from the emerging literature on 
therapeutic dendritic cell cancer vaccination that int radermal delivery results in optimal 
immunogenicity. For this reason we have looked for other peptides that are more universally 
expressed that would be attractive targets for immunization and are administering the TARP 
peptide -pulsed dendritic cell vaccin es in this study intradermally.   
1.2.5 TARP  
A novel protein expressed in patients with prostate and breast cancer has recently been described 
24 .  This 58 amino acid pro tein, T -cell receptor γ alternate reading frame protein (TARP), was 
identified with the expressed sequence database.  The mRNA is initiated in the Jγ 1 exon of the 
TCR γ and the protein expressed is initiated in an alternative reading frame than the TCR γ 
coding sequence. In their initial description of TARP in the human prostate, Pastan et al 
demonstrated that it originated from epithelial cells and not from infiltrating T lymphocytes, and 
that it is expressed in normal prostate epithelium, adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and the 
prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP25.  They subsequently showed that TARP was also 
expressed in three breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissues26 and determined that TARP 
is expressed in androgen -sensitive (LNCaP) bu t not in androgen -independent (PC3) prostate 
cancer cell lines, implicating the role of TARP in prostate cancer progression27.  The protein is 
expressed both by normal and malignant prostate cancer tissue with about 95% of prostate 
cancer specimens positiv e for its expression.  Oh et al determined two HLA -A2 epitopes that 
produce cytolytic T cell responses 28.  These sequences map to amino ac ids 27 -35 and 29 -37.  
TARP27 -35 was found to bind with an affinity that was 10 times greater than that of TARP29 -
37.   These peptides were demonstrated to be immunogenic by immunizing A2Kb transgenic 
mice (expressing human HLA -A*0201) with dendritic cells pulsed with these peptides or with 
DNA encoding the peptide.  Dendritic cell immunization produced a higher level of immunity 
than DNA immunization and as expected due to its higher binding affinity, TARP27 -35 
produced a higher level of CD8+ T cell respons e than TARP29 -37. 
Epitope enhancement of the TARP peptides was performed to increase the level of immunity 
that could be generated with these peptides.  Amino acid substitutions in the TARP27 -35 peptide 
did not increase binding affinity but two amino acid substitutions in TARP29 -37 did produce 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -11- higher binding affinity peptides.  For TARP29 –37, Arg at position 3 and Leu at position 9 were 
substituted with Ala (TARP29 –37-3A) and Val (TARP29 –37-9V), respectively.  Substitution at 
position 3 with Ala in TARP29 –37 resulted in the greatest increase in the binding affinity of the 
peptide.  Although TARP29 –37-9V showed a lower binding affinity to HLA -A2 than TARP29 –
37-3A did, substitution of Leu at position 9 with Val did enhance the binding affinity compared 
with th e wild -type peptide, TARP29 –37.  When the immunogenicity of these peptides was 
evaluated in A2Kb transgenic mice both of the epitope -enhanced peptides produced a higher 
percentage of CD8+ T cells specific than the wild type sequence.  It was also shown tha t T cells 
generated with the epitope enhanced TARP29 -37 sequences reacted with targets pulsed with the 
wild type TARP29 -37 peptide in the mouse.  
Although immunogenicity of these peptides was demonstrated in the mouse it is important to 
confirm their immuno genicity and cross reactivity in humans.  Studies of these peptides in 
human cells showed that TARP29 -37, TARP29 –37-3A, and TARP29 –37-9V were immunogenic 
in human T cells.  TARP29 –37-9V specific T cells recognize targets pulsed with all three 
peptides equa lly well whereas TARP29 –37-3A specific T cells recognized only targets pulsed 
with TARP29 –37-3A, and that TARP29 –37 specific T cells recognized targets pulsed with the 
epitope enhanced peptides less well.  This would suggest that the TARP29 –37-3A peptide w ould 
not be appropriate for immunization in humans whereas the TARP29 –37-9V would be more 
likely to generate T cells that recognize the wild type sequence.  Human T cells specific for 
TARP27 -35 recognized targets pulsed with that sequence as anticipated.  In addition to their 
ability to kill targets pulsed with TARP peptides, CD8+ T cells specific for TARP peptides were 
able to kill human tumor targets that were HLA A2 positive and that expressed TARP sequences.  
The availability of tetramers that react wit h CD8+ T cells specific for TARP provide a simple 
means of evaluating the ability to stimulate immunity to the TARP peptides.  In a limited survey 
tetramer positive cells ranged from 0.66% to 3.9% of the CD8+ T cells in prostate and breast 
cancer patients compared with .01 -.6% in normal controls.  
1.2.6 Dendritic Cell Vaccination with TARP  
This antigen will be presented on the patient's own HLA -A*0201 positive dendritic cells.  
Dendritic cells are very potent antigen presenting cells.  They have several distinct f eatures 
making them ideal vehicles for presentation of these tumor specific peptides.  Dendritic cells 
express a high level of both MHC class I and II molecules, as well as, a variety of adhesion and 
costimulatory molecules that contribute to their ability  to effectively stimulate T cells 29 .  
Dendritic cells have been shown to be more effective in the stimulation of t he immune response 
than B cells or macrophages 30 .  In addition, ex vivo  maturation of dendritic cells may, in part, 
overcome the inability of cancer patients to direct the immune response toward their own tumor.  
Dendritic cells within tumor bearing mice have been found to be marginally effective when 
presenting peptides to the animal’s immune system.  This is due to the presence of vascular 
endothelial growth factor, present in many cancers, including colo rectal cancers bearing ras 
mutations, that inhibits dendritic cell maturation.  However, cells from the same tumor bearing 
animals, matured ex vivo , are extremely effective in presentation to the immune system 31,32.  
Dendritic cells can be matured ex vivo  from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 
interleukin 4 (IL -4) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF)  followed 
by CD40 ligand treatment 33,34.  We have conducted pilot experiments along with the Department 
of Tra nsfusion Medicine using peripheral blood monocytes cells (PBMCs). We have measured

 -12- the up regulation of CD83, costimulatory and adhesion molecules as surrogate markers and have 
measured the function of dendritic cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction 29,35.

We also pl an to further improve our dendritic 
cell manufacturing process utilizing IFN - 
and LPS for dendritic cell maturation.  
Labeur et al have compared both the cell 
surface markers and the functional activity of 
dendritic cells cultured with GM -CSF and IL -
4 (im mature dendritic cells) and those 
cultured with GM -CSF and IL -4 plus CD40L 
or LPS (mature dendritic cells) 26.  The 
mature dendritic cells when compared to 
immature dendritic cells demonstrated greater 
expression of most cell surface markers 
thought to be important in T cell intera ction. 
In addition, the mature dendritic cells produced significantly more interleukin 12 than immature 
dendritic cells.  More importantly, in a tumor challenge model, six of six mice that were 
immunized with antigen pulsed mature dendritic cells did not d evelop tumors while six of six 
mice that were immunized with antigen pulsed immature dendritic cells did develop tumors.  
Further, in an established tumor model, tumor growth was significantly inhibited in mice 
vaccinated with mature dendritic cells when c ompared to mice vaccinated with immature 
dendritic cells 36.  The ability of CD40 ligand to induce the maturation of dendritic cells that are 
better able to stimulate the T cell response has also been evaluated ex vivo in humans.  Morse et 
al were able to show that dendritic cells treated with CD40 ligand were more effective at 
stimulating cytotoxic T cells than were immature dendritic cells grown in GM -CSF and IL -4 37.  
1.2.7 Vaccination with Peptides or Peptide -Pulsed Dendritic Cells  
There are limited studies that address the most effective means for induction of cytotoxic T cell 
responses in patients wi th cancer.  Slingluff compared the use of peptide in adjuvant with 
peptides pulsed on dendritic cells in a small study in patients with melanoma.  This study

 -13- showed a superior response with peptides in adjuvant compared with peptides pulsed on 
dendritic ce lls.  T cell response was monitored in peripheral blood and draining lymph nodes.  In 
patients vaccinated with peptide in adjuvant T cell responses were seen in 42% of peripheral 
blood samples and 80% of lymph nodes whereas in patients vaccinated with pept ides pulsed on 
dendritic cells 11% showed response in the blood and 13% in the nodes.  Despite the disparity in 
immunologic response rates objective responses were observed in both arms of the study.  This 
study used immature dendritic cells and previous s tudies have shown that immature dendritic 
cells are ineffective in producing a cytolytic T cell response compared with mature dendritic 
cells.  Another possible disadvantage with immature dendritic cells is their ability to induce 
tolerance.  This study wi ll address in a randomized fashion the immunogenicity of TARP 
peptides in adjuvant compared with TARP peptides pulsed on mature dendritic cells.

 -16- of brain, visceral or bony metastatic disease, a non -castrate testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (prior 
ADT allowed; must be > 6 months since last dose of ADT), and a PSADT > 3 months and < 15 
months will be will be randomized to receive TARP peptides with Montanide® ISA 51 VG 
adjuvant plus GM-CSF administered by deep subcutaneous (SC) injection or autologous, TARP 
peptide -pulsed dendritic cells administered intradermally (ID).   
TARP peptides or TARP -pulsed dendritic cells will be adminis tered every three weeks at weeks 
3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 for a total of five vaccinations with a booster dose of TARP vaccine given at 
Weeks 48 and 96.   PSADT will be calculated in months at the following study time points: Pre -
Enrollment/Baseline, weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 144.  PSADT will 
be calculated using the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center cancer information prostate 
nomogram for PSA doubling time found at: 
http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/forms/Nomograms/flash/load.cfm?type=Prostate&width=5
86&height=505&title=Prostate%20Nomogram  as recommended in the Prostate Specific Antigen  
Working Group Guidelines.39  Cumulative PSA values within 12 months inclusive of the study 
time point will be used for calculation of the baseline/Week 0 PSADT.  
Exploratory comparisons of percent change in PSADT will be done among the following time 
point s: 
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 12 PSADT  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 24 PSADT  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 36 PSADT  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 48 PSADT  
➢ Week 24 PSADT vs. Week 36 PSADT  
➢ Week 36 PSADT vs. Week 48 PSA DT 
➢ Additional exploratory analyses of PSADT will be performed of Pre -Enrollment/Baseline 
PSADT vs. Weeks 60, 72 and 96 and Week 48 PSADT vs. Weeks 96, 108 and 144 
PSADT.  
Week 24 PSADT responders will be allowed to receive an additional dose of TARP peptide  
vaccine at Week 36.  All patients will receive a booster of vaccine at Weeks 48 and 96.  
Assessment of humoral and cellular immune responses to  TARP peptide vaccination will be 
performed at weeks 0, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 144.  Anti gen-specific T -
lymphocyte responses will be assessed by tetramer staining, IFN - ELISPOT and 51Cr release 
CTL assays following exposure to native wild type and epitope -enhanced TARP peptides.

3.2 VACCINE  ADMINISTRATION  
Following apheresis to remove peripheral blood monocytes for dendritic cell preparation as well 
as peripheral blood mononuclear cells for flow cytometry and immunologic studies at their week 
0 visit, all patients will undergo intranasal vac cination with live attenuated influenza vaccine 
(FluMist ) when seasonally available.  Attenuated influenza vaccine is being administered as a 
control vaccine to characterize the patient’s innate ability to generate immune responses to 
vaccination.  Conser ved HLA -A*0201 restricted cellular and humoral responses to flu matrix 
peptides have been extremely well characterized regarding antibody titers and the range of 
ELISPOT responses that are typically observed in normal healthy individuals.  Following receip t 
of the intranasal flu vaccine, patients will be immediately discharged to home and precautions 
will be taken to minimize the risk of potential transmission to other Clinical Center patients as 
outlined in Section  9.5 
Because live attenuated influenza viruses replicate in the nasopharynx of recipients and can be 
shed in respiratory secretions, the possibility exists that the vaccine viruses can be transmitted to 
susceptible individuals who have not received the vaccine.  Studies in children 8 -36 months of 
age attending daycare who were randomized to receive a single dose of influenza virus vaccine 
live intranasal or placebo indicated that 80% of vaccine recipients shed at least 1 vaccine strain; 
the mean duration  of shedding was 7.6 days (range: 1 -21 days).38  The frequency and duration of 
shedding of vaccine virus strains by individuals 5 -49 years of age who receive  influenza virus 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -18- vaccine live intranasal have not been established.   Consequently, study patients will return to the 
CC at study week 3 which should provide an adequate window to ensure that recipients are 
unlikely to be shedding attenuated viral vaccine strains.  
Patients in Arm A will receive an admixture of the wild -type and epitope -enhanced TARP 
peptides emulsified with Montanide® ISA 51 VG and GM -CSF administered by deep 
subcutaneous (SC) injection.  Patients in Arm B will receive peptide -pulsed dendritic cells 
administered intradermally in two vaccination sites.  Each peptide will be pulsed on dend ritic 
cells separately in order to assure adequate binding of the peptide and cells will not be washed to 
remove free peptide after pulsing.  Following verification of mature dendritic cell validation 
markers and release standards, the separately peptide -pulsed dendritic cells will be recombined 
for administration.  Refer to Appendix 2 for details concerning the production of peptide –pulsed 
dendritic cells by the NIH Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medici ne under the 
supervision of Drs. Marianna Sabatino, Hanh Khuu, Susan Leitman , & David Stroncek.  
For both groups vaccinations will be administered at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 for a total of five 
vaccinations with a booster dose of vaccine at Weeks 48 and 96 . Patients will be monitored for 
immediate adverse event vaccine reactions (VS, clinical assessment) for 1 hours following their 
first TARP peptide vaccine dose.  If no adverse reactions are observed with the first vaccination, 
patients will be monitored f or 15 minutes for all subsequent vaccinations.  If adverse reactions 
are observed following the first vaccine, the duration of post -vaccination monitoring with 
subsequent vaccinations will be determined by the Principal Investigator and Lead Associate 
Investigator as clinically indicated depending on the severity of the initial vaccine reaction.    
Since this protocol involves TARP vaccination in humans for the first time, enrollment will be 
staggered to allow for safety monitoring.  For the first 3 patient s on each study arm, enrollment 
of the next patient can only proceed until the preceding study subject is 2 weeks status -post their 
first vaccination.  If no adverse events are observed in the two week window following the first 
vaccination in these 6 pati ents, enrollment of additional patients may proceed as quickly as is 
logistically feasible.  Cells used for subsequent dendritic cell maturation will be derived from 
monocytes frozen during the initial apheresis.  
3.3 TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS AND IMMUNIZATION STOPPING RULES  
No dose modifications will be made in patients receiving vaccination.  Subjects will cease to 
receive immunization if they experience dose -limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicity will be graded 
according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE) v3.0 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc_v30.html )  
3.3.1 Immunization -Related Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
Immunization -related DLT is defined by the parameters outlined below attributed by the 
Principal Investigator or Protocol Chairperso n as possibly, probably or definitely related to 
vaccine administration:  
3.3.1.1  Any Grade 2 or Grade 3 or greater allergic/hypersensitivity reaction  
3.3.1.2  Any Grade 2 or greater rash consistent with erythema multiforme.  
3.3.1.3  Grade 3 or greater hematologic or non -hematologic  toxicity, excluding lymphopenia.  
Abnormal laboratory studies will be repeated to verify toxicity  
3.3.1.4  Grade 3 or greater acute vascular leak syndrome: respiratory compromise or fluids 
indicated.  
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -19- 3.3.1.5  The following Grade 3 reactions commonly associated with immuniz ation will be dose -
limiting:  
➢ Injection site reactions: ulceration or necrosis that is severe; operative 
intervention indicated.  
➢ Skin rash/desquamation: severe, generalized erythroderma or macular, papular 
or vesicular eruption; desquamation covering > 50% BSA.  
➢ Urticaria: intervention indicated for > 24 hrs.  
3.3.1.6  The following Grade 3 reactions commonly associated with immunization will not be 
dose-limiting:

hrs 
➢ Fatigue: severe fatigue interfering with ADL lasting < 72 hrs  
➢ Fever: > 40.0  C for < 24hrs  
➢ Local lymphadenopathy lasting < 1 week  
3.3.2 Stopping for Excessive toxicity  
If more than one of the first nine subjects in either arm of the trial experiences dose limiting 
toxicity, enrollment to that arm will cease pending discussion and review with the FDA and the 
IRB.  
3.3.3 Delay in Vaccination  
Patients who are unable to receive their vaccine injection as scheduled due to adverse events, 
toxicity or unforeseen personal or medical circumstances and who are otherwise eligible to 
continue on protocol, may be continued on vaccine therapy provided that their next vaccine is 
within three weeks of the previous vaccine.  Patients will be advised of their options concerning 
alternative treatments before proc eeding with the completion of their study vaccinations.  The 
reason for the change in vaccination schedule will be documented in the patient's chart.

4 SUPPORTIVE CARE  
We do not anticipate significant systemic or organ toxicities associated with TARP peptide 
vaccination using either Montanide® ISA 51 VG plus GM -CSF or peptide - pulsed dendritic 
cells.  We have not observed any clinically sig nificant toxicities in our previous trials 
investigating other class I peptides in patients with lung or colon cancer.  Non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory medication or other analgesics and possibly antihistamines may be needed for 
local injection site reacti ons to vaccination.   
5 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION  
5.1 DATA COLLECTION  
The Vaccine Branch clinical research team will perform real time data collection. The Principal 
Investigator will be responsible for oversight of the protocol.  
All patients enrolled on stu dy will be centrally registered at the NCI Central Registration Office.  
All on study evaluations must be performed within one week of their scheduled time point as 
outlined in the study schema ( Appendix 1).  Delay  in vaccine administration is allowed for up to 
3 weeks as outlined in Section  3.3.3 .  Modifications in this policy can be discussed on an 
individual basis with the Lead Associate Investigator.  Research data wi ll be collected in the NCI 
C3D database.  
 
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution. AEs should be reported up to 30 days 
following the last  dose of study drug.   
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment  or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospitalization.  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact  
 
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according  to HHS,  FDA regulations, and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable.  
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  
5.2 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
5.2.1 Immunologic Response Criteria  
Immunologic responses to TARP peptide vaccination will be assessed at weeks 0, 12 (after 3 
vaccines), 18 (after 5 vaccines), 24, 36 , 48, 60 and 96 ; Note: apheresis will be performed at 
weeks 0, 24 , 48 and 96.   Refer to Appendix 3 for details of specimen tube, collection and 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -23- processing and to Appendix 4 for descriptions of the immunology assays.  Additional 
exploratory analyses of TARP immunologic responses will be performed at Weeks 60, 72, 96, 
108, 120, 132 and 144.  
 
A positive immunological response to class I TARP peptides is defined as:  
➢ A three -fold increase over baseline in the number of positive cells by tetramer staining  
OR 
➢ A three -fold increase over baseline in the number of positive cells by IFN - ELISPOT 
assay.  
➢ Positive assays must be confirmed at two study time points to be considered a definitive, 
vaccine -induced positive result.  
➢ Week 24 immunologic responders  will b e allowed to receive an additional dose of TARP 
peptide vaccine at Week 36.  
➢ The study time points at which a positive immunologic response is documented will be 
noted for every patient enrolled on the study.   
 
Hence a patient will be considered a responde r if they demonstrate a positive response as 
described above in either the tetramer or the IFN - ELISPOT assays.  51Cr release cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte (CTL) assays using T2 cells as targets will only be performed in patients 
documented to have a positive te tramer or ELISPOT response and will not be utilized in the 
assessment of immunologic response.  
 
A positive 51Cr release CTL assay will be defined as:   
➢ The percent lysis observed against TARP peptides is at least 2 standard deviations greater 
than the perc ent lysis observed against control peptides AND  
➢ Greater than or equal to a 10% difference in the TARPT peptide percent lysis vs. control 
peptide percent lysis at more than one effector to target cell ratio.   
5.2.2 PSADT Response Criteria  
PSADT was chosen as a  surrogate marker for biochemical response to vaccination based on the 
Prostate -Specific Antigen Working Group’s consensus Guidelines on PSADT.39 Utilization of 
PSADT as a predictive factor of disease progression and prostate cancer death is based on level  
II evidence derived from cohort - or case -controlled analytic studies or controlled, non -
randomized trials that have been validated in multiple data sets,40-42  PSADT will be calculated 
using the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center cancer information pr ostate nomogram for 
PSA doubling time found at: 
http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/forms/Nomograms/flash/load.cfm?t ype=Prostate&width=5
86&height=505&title=Prostate%20Nomogram  recommended in the Prostate Specific Antigen 
Working Group Guidelines.  The PSADT is calculated assuming an exponential increase in 
serum PSA and first order kinetics.  The formula takes into acc ount the natural logarithm of 2 
divided by the slope obtained from fitting a linear regression of the natural log of PSA on time.  
All PSA values used in the calculation should be 0.20 ng/ml or greater and follow an increasing 
trend.  PSA values need not b e consecutively increasing and all values obtained during a 
maximum period of 12 months prior to a given protocol time point will be included in the 
calculation.  The maximum period of the last 12 months is recommended to reflect current 
disease activity b ecause in some men PSADT may change over time. Multiple studies concur 
that men with a PSADT < 3 months are at extremely high risk for metastatic disease progression 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -24- and death with prostate cancer mortality approaching 100%; for this reason they have been 
excluded from participation in this study. In contrast, men with a slow PSADT i.e. > 15 months 
have an extremely low risk of death from prostate cancer.  
The following general guidelines39 regarding PSA determinations and calculation of PSADT 
used in this p rotocol will be adhered to (refer to Appendix 5, PSADT Calculation Guidelines)  
 
Pre-Enrollment/Baseline and On Study PSADT:  
➢ PSADT will be calculated using the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center cancer 
informati on prostate nomogram for PSA doubling time found at: 
http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/forms/Nomograms/flash/load.c fm?type=Prostate&w
idth=586&height=505&title=Prostate%20Nomogram  
➢ Minimum requirements for PSADT include > 3 PSA measurements over > 3 months.  
➢ The interval between PSA measurements must be > 4 weeks.  
➢ For patients receiving 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI ) e.g. finasteride or dutasteride, 
only PSA values obtained after at least 3 months on therapy may be used to calculate 
PSADT.  
➢ Calculated PSADT values will be reported in months  
➢ The same laboratory must have performed PSA values used in the calculation of PSADT.  
➢ All PSA values used in the calculation should be > 0.20 ng/mL and follow a rising trend 
although all values need not be consecutively rising.  
➢ All values obtained over a maximum period of 12 months prior to any given protocol 
time point assessment sh ould be included in the PSADT calculation to reflect the 
patient’s current disease activity.  
➢ PSA values obtained within < 2 weeks of instrumentation, documented infection 
(prostatitis), or radiation proctopathy should be omitted  from inclusion in PSADT 
calculations.  
On Study PSADT will be calculated at baseline and weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 
120, 132, and 144.  
Exploratory comparisons of percent change in PSADT will be done among the following time 
points:  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Wee k 3-12 PSADT/  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 24 PSADT  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 36 PSADT  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 48 PSADT  
➢ Week 24 PSADT vs. Week 36 PSADT  
➢ Week 36 PSADT vs. Week 48 PSADT  
➢ Additional exploratory analyses of  PSADT will be performed of Pre -Enrollment/Baseline 
PSADT vs. Weeks 60, 72 and 96 and Week 48 PSADT vs. Weeks 96, 108 and 144 
PSADT.  
 
5.2.2.1  PSADT Response & Failure  
(assessed in all patients at weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 144.)  
➢ PSAD T response  is defined as:  
o a > 50% increase  in calculated PSADT OR

➢ Patient’s whose PSADT is decreased  by > 50% will be considered PSADT failures.  
➢ Week 24 PSADT responders  will be allowed to receive an additional dose of TARP 
peptide vacc ine at Week 36.  
5.3 TOXICITY CRITERIA  
This study will utilize NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
3.0, published June 10, 2003, for toxicity and adverse event monitoring and reporting.  (Refer to 
http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc_v30.html ). All clinical treatment areas will have access to a 
copy of CTCAE version 3.0.  
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
6.1 OVERALL STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study , on which the sample size will be based is to determine the 
proportion of patients who will generate a specific immune response following vaccination as 
tested in tetramer, ELISPOT and cytotoxicity assay, and to evaluate if this is adequate for future 
consideration. Determination of safety of the vaccination is also an important endpoint.  It is also 
of interest to a ssess risk of progression among patients with metastatic Stage D0 prostate cancer 
naïve to androgen deprivation therapy vaccinated with these peptides using PSA doubling time 
as a surrogate marker of this risk.  
6.2 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE AND STATISTICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR SAMPLE SIZE 
This study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized two arm, pilot trial to explore the 
utility of TARP peptide vacci nation alone or vaccination with TARP peptide -pulsed dendritic 
cells in patients with Stage D0 prostate cancer.  
 
The primary objective is to obtain a reliable estimate of the immunologic response rate to 
vaccination with either peptide vaccine or dendriti c cells in patients with biochemical 
progression and to determine if the rate of immunologic response in either arm is adequate to 
warrant further investigation in subsequent studies.  Evaluation of safety and toxicity will also be 
a primary goal. The stud y is not designed to have adequate power to identify if one arm is 
associated with a significantly improved immunologic response rate as compared to the other, as 
such detection may require very large numbers of patients given the potential similarity of t he 
arms. Furthermore, there is no requirement that only one arm be selected for further 
development. Should both arms demonstrate adequate immunologic responses, then future 
studies will consider either or both arms depending on immune responses, feasibili ty, toxicity 
and other outcomes such as PSADT.  
 
Patients will initially be screened for HLA -A*0201 positivity.  HLA -A*0201 patients will then 
undergo comprehensive protocol eligibility screening and if found to be eligible, will be enrolled 
in the study.  Upon enrollment patients will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive TAPR 
peptide vaccination with Montanide  ISA51 VG plus GM -CSF (Arm A) or TARP peptide -
pulsed dendritic cells (Arm B).   
 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -26- For each arm, using an acceptable immunologic response rate of 4 0% (p1=0.40) and an 
unacceptable rate of 10% (P0=0.10) and using a two -stage optimal design (Simon R, Controlled 
Clinical Trials  10:1-10, 1989) with alpha = 0.05 and beta =0.10, we will initially accrue 9 
patients in each arm. An unacceptable response rate  of 10% (or less) and an acceptable response 
rate of 40% were determined based on historical clinical trial response rates to vaccines and 
immune -based therapies for cancer.4-7  If 0-1 patients develop an immunologic response as 
defined in Section  5.2.1 , then no further patients will be enrolled.  If 2 or more of these 9 patients 
develop an immunologic response, we will accrue 11 additional patients for a maximum total of 
20 patients per arm.  If 2 -4 of 20 has an  immunologic response, then the results from this arm 
will be considered inadequate for further investigation. If 5 or more of these 20 has an immune 
response, we will be able to conclude that the vaccine on the given arm is worthy of further 
development i n this population on the basis of immune response. Under the null hypothesis 
(p0=0.20), the probability of early termination is 77%.  
 
There is no requirement that only one arm be selected for further development; should both arms 
demonstrate adequate immun ologic responses, then future studies will consider either or both 
arms depending on immune responses, feasibility, toxicity and other outcomes such as PSADT.  
 
As stated in Section  3.3.2 , an early stopping rule will be used to ensure that the study subjects do 
not have exposure to excessive toxicity: If more than one of the first nine subjects on a given arm 
experiences dose limiting toxicity (defined in Section  3.3.1 ), enrollment will cease for that arm 
and revisions to the treatment will be discussed with the IRB and FDA. This is because 1/9 has 
an upper one -sided 90% confidence interval limit of 37%, while 2/9 has an upper one -sided 90% 
confidence interval limit of 4 9%; the former would be marginally acceptable as a rate of toxicity 
while the latter is not. In addition, any unusually severe toxicity noted may result in temporary 
suspension of accrual pending re -evaluation of the agent. All toxicities noted will be tab ulated by 
type and grade, for each arm. Any such toxicities that appear in at least 5 patients on either arm 
will also have the distribution of grades of that toxicity compared between the arms using an 
exact Cochran -Armitage test.  
 
The percent of patient s who meet PSADT response criteria as outlined in section  5.2.2  will also 
be evaluated as a secondary endpoint.  In addition, exploratory comparisons of PSADT among 
study time points will be performed as outline d in Section s 3.1 and 5.2.2 .  Given that there will 
be 6 separate comparisons of PSADT, we will only report differences with p<0.01 as being 
statistically significant  while other differences with 0.01 < p <0.05 will be considered to be 
trends. Appropriate 95% confidence intervals will be constructed and reported which takes into 
consideration the two -arm nature of the design.  No formal comparison will be undertaken si nce 
the study does not have adequate power to address this comparison properly.  
 
It is expected that 1 -2 patients per month may be enrolled onto this study. Based on accrual of 
18-20 patients per year, accrual should be completed in approximately 2 to 2.5 years if all 40 
patients were to be required. To allow for the possibility of inevaluable patients, an accrual 
ceiling of 43 will be used.

 -27- 7 SAFETY REPORTING REQ UIREMENTS/DATA AND S AFETY MONITORING 
PLAN  
At each study visit, patients will be evaluated for new  or evolving AEs.  Symptoms will be 
elicited through the use of open -ended questions, followed by appropriate questions that clarify 
the patient’s verbatim description of AEs or changes in concomitant medications.  A review of 
systems will be performed.   
 
The Principal Investigator or Lead Associate Investigator will assess whether the AE or SAE is 
associated with the administration of TARP peptide vaccine:   
➢ Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probably, Definite  
 
7.1 DEFINITIONS  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including a ny abnormal sign (for 
example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the 
subjec t’s participation in the research  
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.  
 
7.1.2 Suspected adverse reactio n 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relation ship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
7.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction  
An adverse event or suspected  adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the r isk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of d rugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.  
7.1.4 Serious  
An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definit ion of a Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -28- 7.1.5 Serious Adverse Event  
An adver se event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it result s in any of the following:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life function s 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
7.1.6 Disability  
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
7.1.7 Life-threatening adverse drug e xperience  
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it 
does not include a reaction that had it occurred  in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
7.1.8 Protocol Deviation (NIH Definition)  
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB -approved research protocol.  
7.1.9 Non-Compliance  (NIH Definition)  
The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Prot ections Program (HRPP) 
policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research 
subjects.  
7.1.10   Unanticipated Problem  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
•  Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in rela tion to  
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and  
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
• Is related or  possibly related to participation in the research; AND  
• Suggests that the research p laces subjects or others at a g reater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.

CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -30- Study endpoints  that are serious adverse events (e.g. all -cause  mortality) must be reported in 
accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between 
the drug and the event (e.g. death from anaphylaxis).  In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the death to the sp onsor.  
Events will be submitted to Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at : CCRsafety@mail.nih.gov  and 
to the CCR PI and study coordinator.  
7.4 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
7.4.1 Principal Investigator/Res earch Team  
The Principal Investigator and Lead Associate Investigator will monitor this pilot, prospective 
randomized study, as required by the FDA as part of the Sponsor Investigator IND held by the 
Principal Investigator.  Based on the minimal risk and the limited number of subjects to be 
studied, monitoring by a Data Safety Monitoring Board is not warranted for this trial.  There will 
be continuous close monitoring of protocol -related toxicity by the Lead Associate Investigator 
and Principal Investigato r.  The study research nurse coordinator and/or data manager will 
generate a bi -weekly (or weekly) reports of all on -study laboratory data with correspondent 
toxicity grading according to CTCAE v3.0 as well as a summary of all clinical and Vaccine 
Report C ard (VRC) surveillance adverse event data for review by the Principal Investigator and 
The Lead Associate Investigator in conjunction with Associate Investigators.  In addition, study 
summaries will be generated every 6 months and forwarded to the FDA.  Ad verse events will be 
reported to the IRB as described in section  7.2. Decisions regarding revision of the protocol or 
consent will be promptly communicated to the IRB and FDA.       
7.4.2 Sponsor Monitoring Plan  
As a s ponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary study  endpoints; adherence to the prot ocol, regulations, and 
SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent verification of study 
data with source documentation focusing on:  
• Informed consent process  
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability  
• Adverse events monitoring  
• Response assessment.  
The monitoring  program also extends to multi -site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by personnel employed by an NCI contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by training and exper ience to monitor the progress of clinical trials. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.

8.1  RATIONALE FOR SUBJECT SELECTION  
All subjects enrolled in this study will be male as the disease under study does not affect women 
or children.  We will make every effort to accrue patients from all racial and ethnic groups.  
Since our referral population is the nation, we should obtain referrals representative of the 
national composition of r aces.  In addition, HLA -A*0201 positivity is not restricted to a 
particular racial or ethnic group: it is present in 49.54% of Caucasians, 33.74% of African -
Americans, and 55.87% of Orientals. Hence the requirement for HLA -A*0201 positivity should 
not prec lude our ability to accrue a racially and ethnically diverse population representative of 
individuals affected by prostate cancer.15  
Participants will be accrued through web -based advertisements, community -based contacts and 
referrals of patients from oth er studies at the Clinical Center.  This protocol will also be 
advertised on the NCI PDQ Clinical Trials database as well as through ClinicalTrials.gov.  
8.2 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The benefit of vaccination with peptides is unknown.  Alt hough several patients in our previous 
Phase I peptide vaccine studies mounted immune responses to various peptides, the benefit or 
clinical significance of these immune responses remains unknown.  However, in animal models, 
immune responses have been corr elated with both a decrease in measurable disease and a 
subsequent resistance to tumor challenge (Ref).  In this study, we will determine the impact of 
vaccination on PSADT, a well established surrogate marker that is a predictive factor of longer 
time to metastases, prostate -cancer death and all -cause adverse clinical outcomes.30-33  The risks 
of vaccination are also unknown.  However, no severe or systemic toxicity in response to 
vaccination with peptides alone has been observed and the most frequent adve rse event is local 
injection site reactions, an observation common to all vaccines.   
8.3 CONSENT AND ASSENT PROCESSES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Consent forms are attached.  Two consent forms will be used for this study.  Participants will 
initially agree to allow the ir blood to be tested for HLA -A*0201 positivity.  The process for 
obtaining patients’ consent for HLA typing may involve telephone contact only.  The study will 
be explained to the prospective patient and any questions answered.  The consent form will be 
signed and witnessed and returned with the blood sample for HLA typing to the NIH by FEDEX.  
If the patient is HLA -A*0201 positive they will be invited for a screening visit at the NCI to be 
evaluated for protocol eligibility. Following eligibility screenin g, each patient will be discussed 
with the Principal Investigator or the Lead Associate Investigator.  Eligible patients will be 
presented with a detailed description of the study protocol plan and treatment.  The specific 
requirements, objectives, risks, alternatives, time commitments and potential benefits will be 
reviewed with the patient.  A copy of the Informed Consent will be provided to the patient for 
their review.  The patient will be reassured that participation in this study is entirely voluntary  
and that they may withdraw or decide against receipt of vaccination at any time without adverse 
consequences.  The Principle Investigator, Lead Associate Investigator or their designee will 
summarize the screening results and answer any questions prior to  obtaining Informed Consent.

9.5 INFLUENZA VIRUS VACCINE LIVE INTRANASAL  
9.5.1 Product Description  
The influenza virus vaccine live intranasal ( FluMist  )is a live trivalent nasally administered 
vaccine intended for active immunization for the prevention of influenza.  The product is 
manu factured by MedImmune and will be purchased by the Clinical Center Pharmacy.  T he 
previous season’s vaccine might be used until the supply for the current influenza season 
becomes available.   
9.5.2 How Supplied  
This vaccine contains live attenuated, cold adapte d virus from both influenza A and B.  Each 0.2 
mL dose is formulated to contain 107.0+0.5 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose) of live 
attenuated influenza virus reassortants of the strains recommended by the U.S. Public Health 
Service (USPHS).      
9.5.3 Stability and Storage  
Influenza virus vaccine live intranasal can be stored for extended periods at 2 -8 ºC.  Influenza 
virus vaccine live intranasal is a clear to slightly cloudy, colorless to pale yellow liquid; some 
proteinaceous particulates may be p resent.  The thawed vaccine should not be refrozen.  
9.5.4 Administration Procedures  
Patients should receive 0.2 ml intranasally of influenza virus vaccine (0.1ml in each nostril) 
during vaccination. Under no circumstances should the vaccine be administered pare nterally.  If 
the vaccinee sneezes after administration of the intranasal vaccine, the dose should not be 
repeated. Influenza virus vaccine live intranasal is contraindicated in patients with known 
hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, includin g egg or egg products, individuals 
with a history of Guillan -Barre Syndrome, a known or suspected immunodeficiency 
disease/condition and individuals with asthma or reactive airway disease or other chronic 
pulmonary, cardiovascular or metabolic conditions.  Vaccine administration should be postponed 
for a least 72 hours after the acute phase of a febrile and /or respiratory illness.  
9.5.5 Special Precautions  
Because live attenuated influenza viruses replicate in the nasopharynx of recipients of influenza 
virus vac cine live intranasal and can be shed in respiratory secretions, the possibility exists that 
the vaccine viruses can be transmitted to susceptible individuals who have not received the 
vaccine.  The manufacturer states that individuals receiving influenza v irus vaccine live 
intranasal should avoid close contact with immunocompromised individuals for at least 21 days 
after vaccination.  To minimize risk of transmission of attenuated vaccine virus to other Clinical 
Center patients the following procedures will  be adhered to:  
➢ influenza virus vaccine live intranasal will be administered immediately prior to the 
patient’s departure from the Clinical Center.  
➢ The patient will be asked to wear a mask in the process of exiting the building and 
will be immediately disc harged to home.

9.6.6 Peptide Vaccine Preparation   
To prepare a water -in-oil emulsion vaccine, consisting of the peptide (aqueous phase) and the 
adjuvant  Montanide  ISA 51 VG (oil phase), combine equal parts of the peptide and the 
adjuvant  and su bject the mixture to h igh sheer forces using the following method:  
 
Syringe Method of Emulsification (Investigator’s Preference): Arm A Patients 101 -110 
For preparation of emulsions of water -soluble peptide antigens in an adjuvant oil phase for 
immunization a modification of th e "double hubbed needle method" will be employed.  In this 
method two sterile 2.5 ml glass Hamilton syringes (TLL (PTFE Luer Lock) w/o slots #81420, 
Hamilton Co., Reno,Nev) with Teflon plungers and male Luer Lock tip connectors are used.  
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -38- The materials are  kept sterile at all times.  The adjuvant, Montanide® ISA 51 VG (0.8 ml) is 
drawn up completely in one syringe using a sterile 23 gauge needle.  The needle is removed and 
discarded and any air bubbles displaced. A sterile double ended female Teflon connect or (3/4 
inch, 24 gauge, #86510, Hamilton Co., Reno,Nev) is attached to the adjuvant syringe and the 
plunger is pushed carefully to allow the adjuvant to fill the connector space. The peptide aqueous 
solution (0.82 ml total) is then drawn up into the other glass syringe with a sterile 23 gauge 
needle.  The needle is discarded and any air bubbles displaced.  The syringe containing the 
aqueous peptide solution is securely attached to the free female end of the Teflon connector.   
 
It is very important  that the  first pass be aqueous peptide antigen into oil adjuvant to 
produce the correct water -in oil -emulsion.   A water -in-oil emulsion is obtained by briskly 
forcing the aqueous peptide solution through the connector into the adjuvant and passing the 
material bac k and forth between the two syringes 40 -50 times. This is best achieved by holding 
the connector between thumb and forefinger of one hand with the syringe held securely in the 
palm of the hand and the other syringe held securely in the palm of the other ha nd and firmly 
pressing the plunger of the syringe on a non -slippery surface or blue diaper. The material is 
passed back and forth between the two syringes by a rocking motion in which the plungers are 
alternately pushed in and out by forced pressure of the  plunger on the bench top. As the emulsion 
forms, increased resistance should be noted, the emulsion should appear homogeneous (opaque 
white) with no trapped air bubbles. Following emulsification,  almost the entire emulsion (1.5 ml) 
should be drawn up in o ne syringe, detached from the Teflon connecter assembly and a sterile 23 
gauge needle attached to the syringe. Gently push the emulsion into the needle until a small drop 
is visible at the tip.  The peptide -adjuvant emulsion is now ready for immunization.  
 
Modified Syringe Method of Emulsification: Arm A Patients 111 -120 
For preparation of emulsions of water -soluble peptide antigens in an adjuvant oil phase for 
immunization, a modification of the "double hubbed needle method" will be employed.  In this 
meth od two sterile 3 ml Norm -Ject plastic Luer Lock tip syringes (manufactured by Henke Sass 
Wolf in Tuttlingen, Germany) are used.  The materials are kept sterile at all times.  The adjuvant, 
Montanide® ISA 51 VG (0.8 ml) is drawn up completely in one syringe  using a sterile 23 gauge 
needle.  The needle is removed and discarded and any air bubbles displaced. A sterile Discofix, 
3-way stopcock (manufactured by B. Bruan Medical, Inc., Bethlehem, PA) is attached to the 
adjuvant syringe and the plunger is pushed c arefully to allow the adjuvant to fill the connector 
space. The peptide aqueous solution (0.82 ml total) is then drawn up into the other plastic 
syringe with a sterile 23 gauge needle.  The needle is discarded and any air bubbles displaced.  
The syringe co ntaining the aqueous peptide solution is securely attached to the opposite end of 
the 3 -way stopcock.   
 
It is very important  that the first pass be aqueous peptide antigen into oil adjuvant to 
produce the correct water -in oil -emulsion.  Peptide will then be emulsified as follows:  
➢ 20 “pre -emulsion cycles” will be performed (a cycle is defined as one bass back and 
forth between the two syringes).  The pre -emulsion cycles are to be performed slowly , 
such that 20 cycles are performed over approximately 1 minut e.  The pre -emulsion 
cycles are a necessary and important step in the quality of the final emulsion.  
➢ Following the pre -emulsion cycles, 100 additional cycles will be performed such that 
the additional 100 cycles are performed over approximately 1 minute.

CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -39- ➢ Withdraw a total of 1.5 ml (~1.0mg of peptide) for administration into one of the 
syringes, disconnect from the 3 -way stopcock and cap the syringe.  
➢ Label the syringe with the CRIS label (a “butterfly” label may be used).  
9.6.7 Administration Procedures   
Divide p eptide vaccine  emulsion dose volumes of greater than 1.5 mL into two or more 
injections. Administer peptide vaccine emulsions prepared with Montanide® ISA 51 VG by deep 
subcutaneous injection using a 23 gauge needle.  Injections will be preferentially give n into the 
anterior thigh but the upper arm may be used if necessary.  The same extremity will be used for 
each dose of peptide administered on any given day but the extremities may be rotated.

 -47- Appendix 2 Standard Operating Procedure for Dendritic Cell Vaccine Preparation  
 
Autologous Cell Harvest  
 
Blood collection shall be by standard lymphapheresis. 8 to 15 liters of whole blood will be 
processed in order to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) with a target number of 
at least 2.2 ×109 monocytes. Lymphocytes will also be cryopreserved. Apheresis will be 
performed in the Clinical Center (CC) Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) using 
approved standard operating procedures. Bilateral peripheral venous access will be used for 
apheresis whenever possible. Alternatively, a temporary femoral central venous catheter (CVL) 
will be placed for collection. If this is necessary, the patient will be  admitted to the hospital for 
CVL placement prior to starting apheresis. The CVL will be inserted by appropriately trained 
personnel (e.g., Critical Care, Interventional Radiology, General Surgery) with the assistance of 
anesthesiology as indicated. The pa tient will remain hospitalized until the CVL is removed. 
Prophylactic intravenous CaCl2 and MgSO4 infusions may be administered during apheresis to 
treat or prevent citrate toxicity at the discretion of the DTM physician per routine.  
 
Patient Cell Process ing 
 
All cell processing will be conducted in accordance with approved DTM policies and 
procedures.  
 
TARP Peptide -Pulsed Dendritic Cells  
 
Background:  Autologous dendritic cells prepared from peripheral blood monocytes will be 
loaded with 2 different TARP -derived peptides.  These peptides are made of amino acids 27 -35 
and 29 -37, namely TARP 27 -35 and TARP 29 -37-9V, comprised of HLA -A2-restricted epitopes 
that are involved in the cytolytic T cell response. TARP 29 -37-9V contains a substitution that 
has been s hown to enhance its binding affinity. Different fractions of autologous dendritic cells 
will be pulsed individually with only one of these peptides and the two fractions will be 
combined before administration to the patient.  
 
Formulation and Preparation : Autologous peptide -pulsed dendritic cell vaccines will be 
prepared under GMP conditions from cryopreserved patient monocytes. Autologous monocytes 
for dendritic cell culture will be enriched from peripheral blood MNC apheresis collections by 
counter -flow el utriation, aliquoted into at least 6 vials with ~ 333 x 106 cells/vial and 
cryopreserved for future preparation of the dendritic cell products. After thaw, the monocytes 
will be placed into a 5 day culture with rhIL -4 and rhGM -CSF to generate immature dend ritic 
cells, followed by pulse with KLH and maturation with LPS and IFN -, and pulsed with TARP 
peptide. After removing peptide -pulsing media, dendritic cells will be concentrated down at 40 x 
106 cells/ml in infusion media (Plasma -Lyte A containing 10% au tologous heat inactivated 
plasma).  The final peptide -loaded, volume -reduced mature dendritic cell product will be 
prepared in sterile syringes for fresh administration intradermally.  A validated manufacturing 
process described in the Department of Transfu sion Medicine, Clinical Center, NIH standard 
operating procedures will prepare the dendritic cell vaccine product. Detailed standard operating 
procedures for processing, labeling, storage, and quality assays are available on site in the Cell 
Processing Sec tion of the Department of Transfusion Medicine.

 -48- Stability and Storage:   Autologous peptide -pulsed dendritic cell vaccines will be harvested from 
the 5 -day culture product and packaged for fresh administration on the same day according to 
Standard Operat ing Procedures of the Department of Transfusion Medicine. A fixed autologous  
peptide -pulsed dendritic cell vaccine dose of 20 X 106 cells/ in 0.25ml or 0.5ml will be 
administered immediately upon receipt in the clinical setting.  Post packaging tests indic ated that 
the product was stable for at least 2hours.

12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 144.  Apher esis to ensure adequate numbers of 
cells for dendritic cell vaccine preparation (subjects randomized to Arm B) and for assessment of 
immunologic responses (all subjects) will be performed at weeks 0, 24, 48 and 96.  The 
procedures involved in each assay ar e outlined below.  
 
Separation of PBMCs  
 
At week 0 and subsequent non-apheresis  time points (weeks 12, 18, 36, 60, 72, 84, 108, 120, 
132, and 144) blood will be drawn for immunological assays in 6 10ml green top tubes 
containing heparin.  This will be divid ed into aliquots, diluted with PBS 1:2 and 12 mls of 
Ficoll -Hypaque will be layered under 30 ml of the diluted patient sample.  The cells will be spun 
at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes.  The cells at the interface of the ficoll and the serum will then be 
collecte d and washed X 2.  
 
Tetramer Assay (All Patients)  
 
Utilizing HLA A2.1 tetramers containing TARP peptide sequences, cells obtained prior to 
vaccination and those obtained post vaccination will be stained with these tetramers and the 
precursor frequency (if a ny) will be determined at baseline and following TARP vaccination.  
 
IFN- ELISPOT Assay (All Patients)  
 
Lymphocytes will be separated from heparinized blood using density gradient centrifugation and 
then be placed in human AB serum with 10% DMSO for storag e in liquid nitrogen.   At week 24, 
samples from weeks 0, 12, 18 and 24 will be assessed concurrently utilizing the ELISPOT 
assay.   The ELISPOT measures the number of IFN -
 cells and will be used for determination 
of CTL precursor frequency to TARP peptides  in both pre - and post -vaccination peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).  Additional ELISPOT assays will be preformed using samples 
from weeks 0, 24 and 48 as well as extension year (48 -96 and 96 -144) timepoints.  
 
Briefly, 96 -well MultiScreenTM -HA (n itrocellulose) plates are coated with capture mAb against 
human IFN -
 overnight at RT.   Effectors will be thawed and cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 
plus 10% human AB serum.   Plates are washed and blocked for 2 h with RPMI 1640 plus 10% 
human AB serum.   C1R.A2, antigen presenting cells (APC), are irradiated with 20,000 rad and 
pulsed for 2 h at 37ºC with either TARP peptide, Flu matrix peptide, a negative control peptide 
(TAX peptide) or a positive control peptide (CEF peptide pool - see notes below).  Non -pulsed 
C1R.A2 APC will be incubated in tandem and will serve as a negative control.  1 x 105 PBMC 
are added to each well followed by pulsed - or non -pulsed C1R.A2 cells at an effector:APC ratio 
of 1:1.   Each sample is run in six replicates to control for var iability.  HLA -A2 binding Flu 
matrix peptide 59 -66 serves as a positive control for inherent cellular reactivity.   In addition, 
PBMC from two "normal" HLA -A2-positive individuals with previously determined levels of 
FMP - or CMV -peptide T -cell precursors ar e run as assay controls.  Cells are incubated for 24h 
and lysed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) -Tween (.05%).   Biotinylated antihuman IFN -

CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -52- antibody in PBS -Tween containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) is added and the plates are 
incubated overnight  at 4°C. Plates are then washed and incubated with streptavidin -alkaline 
phosphatase for 2 h at RT.   Spots are visualized with BCIP -NBT substrate and subjected to 
automated evaluation using the ImmunoSpot Imaging system (Cellular Technology LTd, 
Cleveland,  OH).   ELISPOT assays will be performed by the Laboratory of Cell Mediated 
Immunity (Dr. Anatoly Malyguine) at NCI Frederick.    
 
NOTE:  The CEF peptide pool from Mabtech may be used as HLA.A2 positive control peptides 
as alternatives to flu matrix peptide (FMP) as an HLA.A2 positive control.  The CEF peptide 
pool is a pool of 23 HLA class I restricted T cell epitopes from human cytomegalovirus, Epstein -
Barr virus and influenza virus. The peptide has been shown to stimulate the release of IFN -γ 
from CD8+ T-cells in individuals with certain highly frequent HLA types (HLA: A1, A2, A3, 
A11, A24, A68, B7, B8, B27, B35, B44).   Chosen epitopes are presented by the most common 
Caucasian HLA types, whose cumulative frequencies represent >100% of Caucasian individual s. 
The 23 peptides cover 11 HLA types. The CEF peptide pool has proven useful as a peptide 
specific positive control in ELISPOT, CTL and intracellular cytokine assays using human 
PBMC. Original pool described by Currier et. al  
 
51Cr Release CTL Assay (Pat ients with Evidence of Positive Tetramer and IFN - ELISPOT 
Responses)  
 
3 X 106 cells/well in a 24 well plate will be in vitro pulsed for 7 days in the presence of the 
following conditions:   
1) 10 
 M of the TARP 27 -35 peptide (Native/WT peptide)  
2) 10 
 M of the TARP 29 -37-9V peptide (Epitope Enhanced Peptide)  
3)  
   flu matrix peptide (lower concentration due to potent stimulation 
peptide).   
 
On day one 1000 U/ml IL -7 will be added and on day three cultures will be supplemented with 
20 IU IL -2/ml.  On d ay 7, cells will be harvested and plated to result in fixed effector to target 
cell ratios.  Cells initially cultured with native or epitope enhanced TARP peptides will be tested 
against targets pulsed with 50 µM of their respective TARP peptide, 50 µM of TAX negative 
control peptide, and 50 µM of CEF positive control peptide.  Cells initially cultured with flu 
matrix peptide will be tested against targets pulsed with 1 µM flu matrix peptide and 50 µM of 
TAX negative control peptide, and 50 µM of CEF positi ve control peptide. Targets will be 
labeled with 150 
 Ci [51Cr] sodium dichromate.  All target cells will then be washed three times 
and 3,000 labeled targets aliquoted into each well in a 96 -well tissue culture plate that has 
already been plated with effe ctor cells.  At this point, both the effector and target cells will be 
suspended in complete T cell medium with 10% fetal calf serum and with a 10 fold excess of 
K562s (over targets).  The plate will be incubated at 37o C for four hours.  Supernatants will  be 
harvested using a Skatron supernatant harvesting device and the samples counted on a gamma 
counter.  Spontaneous release values will be obtained by incubating targets alone and maximum 
release values obtained by lysing the targets with Triton X -100.   
 
The percent specific lysis is determined, on triplicate samples, by the following formula:  percent 
specific lysis = 100 X (experimental release - spontaneous release)/(maximum release - 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -53- spontaneous release).  The percent specific lysis of targets with TA RP  and control peptide will 
be compared to the percent specific lysis of targets without peptide.  If these are significantly 
different using student’s t test and if there is a greater than 10% difference at more than one 
effector:target ratio, we will co nsider the CTL assay to be positive.   
 
NOTE Regarding Immunologic Response Testing:  Assays will be run in batch for specimens 
from weeks 0. 12, 18 and 24.  Samples with reactivity at week 24 will be used as a comparator 
control for batch assays for speci mens run from weeks 36, 48 60 and 96.  
 
Restimulation Assay Following Apheresis at Weeks 0, 24, 48 and 96 (All Patients)  
 
The restimulation assay will be performed by the lab of Cell Mediated Immunity at NCI 
Frederick.  Once apheresis is collected, prior to  monocyte elutriation  (week 0 only), 10 ml of 
apheresed PBMCs should be sent to the NCI Frederick Clinical Support Laboratory for 
processing.  These cells will be placed in a three week cytotoxicity assay in which they are 
stimulated repeatedly with the mi xture of TARP peptides with which they were vaccinated and 
flu matrix peptides as a control. A fraction will also be cryopreserved for future immunologic 
assays.  Following these repeated stimulations, cells with then be tested on targets pulsed with 
each of these three peptides and on HLA A2.1 positive tumor cells expressing TARP.  
 
Lymphocyte Subsets for FACS Analysis  
 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be tested for the following markers via flow cytometry; 
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD3 -/CD16/56+, CD3+/CD16/CD 56+.  Additional testing will be done on all 
patients in the research laboratory.  We plan to use these markers to determine whether 
vaccination has caused a change in the number of these cells circulating in the peripheral blood 
and in the expression of c ell surface markers.  This assay will require three purple top tubes.  
 
Multiparameter Flow Cytometric Analysis of NKT Cells  
 
Analysis will be performed by the laboratory of Dr. Jane Trepel. NKT cells will be identified by 
mulitparameter flow cytometry.  Ma rkers may include, but are not limited to, Va24, Vb11, CD3, 
CD1d tetramer, CD4, CD8, and Hoechst 33258 for identification of viable cells.  If sample 
permits, PBMC may be placed in culture for NKT cell activation, i.e. with -galactosylceramide, 
incubated at 37 C, and intracellular cytokines such as IFN -, IL-4, IL -13 may be evaluated 
using multiparameter flow cytometry.  If sample permits, immune cell subsets that contribute to 
regulation of the NKT axis, i.e. Tregs, may be analyzed.

Appendix 5: Guidelines and Worksheet for Calculations of PSADT  
Appendix 5A Guidelines and Worksheet for Calculation of PSADT  
Pre-Enrollment/Baseline and On Study PSADT Calculation:  
 PSADT will be calculated using the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center cancer 
information prostate nomogram for PSA doubling time found at: 
http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/forms/Nomograms/flash/load.cfm?type=Prostate&width
=586&height=505&title=Prostate%20Nomogram  
 Minimum req uirements for PSADT include > 3 PSA measurements over > 3 months.  
 The interval between PSA measurements must be > 4 weeks.  
 For patients receiving 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI) e.g. finasteride or dutasteride, only 
PSA values obtained after at least 3 months on therapy may be used to calculate PSADT.  
 PSA values used in the calculation of PSADT must have been performed by the same 
laboratory, when possible.  
 All PSA values used in th e calculation should be > 0.20 ng/mL and follow a rising trend 
although all values need not be consecutively rising.  
 All values obtained over a maximum period of 12 months prior to a given protocol time point 
will be included in the PSADT  calculation to reflect the patient’s current disease activity.

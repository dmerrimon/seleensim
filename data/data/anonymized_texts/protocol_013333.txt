Abstract:  
The prevalence of postoperative dysphagia (swallowing impairment) is critically high in patient s with cardiovascular 
disease who undergo cardiac surgery (CS) with estimates ranging from 3% -94%. Notably, postoperative dysphagia in 
CS patients has been linked to morbidity and mortality. A recent research study that prospectively examined 
postoperative  dysphagia in a cohort of 182 CS patients revealed that CS patients who aspirated but had an effective 
cough response had reduced rates of pneumonia, intubation, death, and hospital readmission, and also had a shorter 
hospital length of stay (LOS)/reduced health care costs. These findings indicate that an effective cough response may 
lead to improved health -related outcomes in CS patients, implying that therapeutics focused on improving cough 
peak expiratory flow rate may be beneficial.  Respiratory strength  training (RST) is a treatment approach that has led 
to improvements in cough strength and effectiveness in a variety of patient populations with dysphagia. Given its 
effectiveness in improving pulmonary and swallow function in high -risk patients with dysp hagia, implementing RST 
preoperatively may be an effective approach to prevent postoperative impairments in airway clearance physiologic 
capacity and swallowing, thereby mitigating postoperative adverse health -related outcomes. Therefore, this pilot 
resear ch study will investigate the safety, feasibility, and impact of a preoperative RST program i n CS patients with 
reduced airway clearance physiologic capacity via three specific aims: 1) Determine the safety and feasibility of a 
preoperative RST program; 2)  Examine the impact of a preoperative RST program on expiratory, inspiratory, and 
airway clearance physiologic capacity; and 3) Investigate the impact of a preoperative RST program on swallowing 
safety and health -related outcomes in CS patients. To determi ne the safety and feasibility of RST, attendance at 
telehealth /in-person  sessions, RST adherence, and adverse outcomes will be tracked. To examine the impact of RST  
on patient outcomes , longitudinal evaluations of breathing and swallowing will be performed, and health -related 
outcomes tracked. This is the first study to explore preoperative RST in CS patients to improve swallowing safety and 
mitigate adverse health -related outcomes. Findi ngs will provide preliminary data to support clinical utility of 
preoperative RST in high -risk CS patients and will support further research in a larger cohort of CS patients to 
elucidate the efficacy of RST and to determine the optimal training regimen an d patients who would benefit from 
RST.  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS:  
We seek to examine the safety, feasibility , and clinical utility of a preoperative respiratory strength training (RST)  
program in cardiac surgical ( CS) patients with the following specific aims:  
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a preoperative RST program will be safe and feasible in CS patients. Approach: CS 
patients will complete at-home  RST with weekly telehealth sessions  and one in -person session at mid -point . 
Attendance, RST adherence, and adverse events will be tracked.  
Aim2: Test the hypothesis that a preoperative RST program will improve respiratory and airway clearance 
physiologic capacity in CS patients. Approach: Forced vital capacity, m aximum expiratory and inspiratory pressure, 
volun tary cough peak expiratory flow, and cough spirometry metrics will be obtained before and immediately after 
RST. Functional measures of dyspnea and speech rate/pausing during speech will also be tracked (London Chest Activity 
of Daily Living scale [LCADL],  Bamboo passage) . Descriptive statistics and a repeated measures analysis will evaluate 
potential change in physiologic metrics of interest.  
Safety, Feasibility, and Impact of Preoperative Respiratory Strength Training in Cardiac Surgical Patients  Protoco l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 2 Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that a preoperative RST program will improve postoperative respiratory, swallowing and 
health -related  outcomes. Approach: Following surgery,  a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing will be 
performed  and h ealth -related  outcomes examined.  
Outcomes will provide needed ‘proof of concept’ feasibility and safety data and deliver preliminary insights into the 
potential role of a proactive , targeted , and mechanistically guided  ‘prehabilitation’ for CS patients to improve airway 
clearance capacity  and health -related  outcomes. If hypotheses are confirmed, these data will support future large -
scale clinical trials.  
 
SIGNIFICANCE : 
A reported 30.3 million Americans, or 12.1% of the populat ion, are living with cardiovascular disease (CVD),1 conferring 
an annual economic cost of ~$219 billion.2 According to the American Heart Associat ion, more than 1 million adults 
undergo cardiac surgical (CS) procedures in the United States annually , with this number expected to increase over the 
next decade.3 Unfortunately, swallowing difficulty (dysphagia) is  a common postoperative complication of CS that is 
associated with poor patient outcomes.4–8 We recently conducted the first prospective study utilizing instrumental 
imaging techniques and validated swallowing outcomes in CS patients.9 In the 182 CS patients examined with fiberoptic 
endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), unsafe swallowi ng was confirmed in 94% of patients (66% penetration, 
29% aspiration) and inefficient swallowing (pharyngeal residue) in 52%  (Fig. 1)  following extubation.9 Of significance 
was our findings that postoperative aspiration was associated with an 85 -hour delay to resume oral intake, a 43% 
increased length of hospital stay, ~$50,000 increased cost of care, pneu monia (OR:2.6), reintubation (OR: 5.7), and 
death (OR: 2.8).9 Swallowing profiles, aspiration risk fact ors, and associated outcomes from this study are summarized 
in Figure 1.  
 
Closer inspection of these data revealed significant differences in health -related outcomes among aspirating CS 
patients when stratified by cough response profiles. Specifically, asp irators who produced an effective cough to expel 
tracheal aspirate from the airway demonstrated significantly reduced rates of pneumonia, reintubation, mortality, 
readmission, LOS, and cost of care compared to aspirators who could not eject tracheal aspira te from the airway (Table 
1).9  Thus, a CS patient’s  physiologic capacity to produce a strong and effec tive cough was a significant prognostic 
factor  in aspirating individuals. Given that cough strength represents a modifiable physiologic variable , this finding 
was of high clinical significance, revealing a potential treatment target to improve CS patient o utcomes  that motivate 
this proposal.  Fig. 1: Prevalence, risk factors and outcomes of dysphagia in 182 CS postoperative 
patients.9

Our data, combined with other  published reports documenting suboptimal outcomes in aspirating CS patients,4,5 
highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve swallowing and airway clearance abilities in CS patients that 
mitigate  the development of associated sequelae  and improve patient outcomes.  Unfortunately, no such intervention 
studies currently exist in the literature, resulting in gaps in knowledge and suboptimal patient care in this area.10–12 
While many dysphagia risk factors cannot be modified, airway physiologic capacity 
represents one dysphagic risk factor that can be modified (increased) via targeted 
exercise programs . Respiratory strength training (RST) has been utilized across 
several high -risk dysphagia patient populations that is noted to improve physiologic 
and patient outcomes.13–22 First applied in individu als with Parkinson’s disease (PD), 
a 4-week RST was noted to increase cough effectiveness, swallowing safety 
(penetration -aspiration scale [PAS] scores), and hyolaryngeal excursion during 
swallowing.13,16 Likewise, a 4 -5 week RST program implemented in stroke survivors 
was reported to improve maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), cough peak 
expiratory flow, cough volume acceleration, reflexive urge to cough responses , and 
swallowing safety.15,19 Similarly, in HNC patients with chronic radiation associated 
dysphagia, implementation of an 8 -week RST program led to improved  expiratory 
pressure generating capacity, swallowing safety, and patient reported quality of 
life.14  
Our group has examined the impact of early proactive RST in a progressive series of 
studies in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).17,18,20 –22 Given that a 
reported 85% of individuals with ALS develop dysphagia, dystussia (cough 
impairment) , and dyspnea during the disease progression,23–26 we proposed that 
proactive , targeted exercises of the upper aerodigestive trac t during the early  stages 
of the disease and prior  to the development of significant impairment would 
increase physiologic reserve to improve and/or maintain airway clearance 
physiologic capacity into inevitable disease progression. This work has noted tha t 
RST programs of varying lengths (5 -weeks to 24 months) is associated with 
improvements in pulmonary, cough, and swallow function in patients with early stage ALS.17,18,20 –22  
For example, we implemented a combined expiratory and inspir atory RST program in an individual recently diagnosed 
with a bulbar onset C9Orf72 form of ALS.20 Although this individual demonstrated safe swallowing at the time of 
diagnosis, peak expiratory cough flow , and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) physiologic capacity were significantly 
impaired, with the former encroaching the typical threshold considered to require reactive cough assist interventions 
(<270L/min). We , therefore , implemented RST, that the pati ent diligently completed for a two year period, with noted 
gains in  peak expiratory cough flow (Fig. 2A), MEP (Fig. 2B), and MIP (Fig. 2C).20 Importantly, when this individual did 
develop dysphagia and unsafe swallowing, he had adequate physiologic capa city to defend his airway (expel tracheal 
aspirate materials).  Outcome:

 4 To date, no group has examined the impact of a combined inspiratory and expiratory RST program in CS patients 
targeting increased upper airway physiologic capacity before surgery that may impac t postoperative patient outcomes.   
Here, we seek to inform current knowledge gaps by examining the utility of a proactive, preoperative RST program in 
a small cohort of CS patients . Our central supposition is that a preoperative RST program will improve a CS patient’s 
physiologic capacity to defend the airway and thereby improve CS postoperative patient outcomes.  
 
APPROACH:  
Overview: The current pilot  project  seeks to determine the safety, feasibility, and impact 
of preoperative RST program in 25 CS patients who are at high risk for developing post -
surgical dysphagia. Thus, this represents a ‘proof of concept’ study to support subsequent 
larger -scale  clinical t rials. Briefly, Aim 1 will examine the feasibility and safety of the RST   
program by monitoring treatment adherence, telehealth /in-person  session attendance, 
and closely monitoring adverse events related to RST. Aim 2  will determine the physiologic 
impact of the RST program by comparing measurements of  forced vital capacity (FVC),  
MEP, MIP, voluntary cough peak expiratory flow (PEF), and cough spirometry metrics as 
well as functional measures of dyspnea and (LCADL), Bamboo passage). before versus after 
RST (i.e., research exam 1 vs.  research exam 2, Fig 3). Additionally, a FEES will be performed 
to index baseline swallowing and to provide secondary treatment outcomes indexed by the 
validated penetration -aspiration scale (PAS) , dynamic imaging grade of swallowing toxicity 
(DIGEST), the New Zealand secretion scale (NZSS), and the Yale pharyngeal residue severity 
rating scale (YRS) . Completion of Aims 1 and 2 will occur within one month  prior to surgery 
(Fig. 3).  Aim 3  will involve monitoring and collectio n of health -related outcomes during the 
postoperative recovery phase and postoperative pulmonary function testing and FEES 
following extubation.  This study timeline is depicted in Figure 3.   
 
Design:  This study represents a longitudinal pilot cohort study  intended to collect preliminary data regarding the safety 
and feasibility of a preoperative intervention program, to inform larger comparative studies that will utilize a between 
groups comparison. Similar study designs have been implemented in other pilo t treatment studies in speech -language 
pathology.17,27,28 While study designs involving group comparisons were considered for this project, the current design 
was chosen to ensure feasibility and a tightly conducted pilot or proof of concept study to allow detailed and rigorous 
outcomes and analyses. Further, co nsideration was given to the nature, scope, budget, and timeline of this grant 
mechanism intended for new investigators , and it was determined that a smaller, feasible study was most appropriate.

 5 Recruitment:  Dr. Plowman is a faculty member of the Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, and 
therefore has close ties with this patient population and clinical setting. Further, the ARC Lab has a strong history of 
successful collaborations with t he cardiothoracic surgeons at the UF Heart and Vascular hospital  (Drs. Jeng, Martin, 
Beaver, Arnaoutakis ) who see patients in this preoperative clinic.  Participants will be recruited from the preoperative 
clinic visit. Drs. Jeng and Donohue will identify e ligible participants who meet inclusion criteria from clinic schedules 
and will approach identified individuals who will be informed of their potential eligibility to participate  and asked if 
they would like to learn about this study. If they express inter est, an approved study team member listed on this 
protocol will verbally detail the aims of the study, specific requirements for inclusion , and answer any questions from 
patients and caregivers. They will also be provided with a copy of the informed consen t form  to read over. Those who 
wish to be enrolled will sign an informed consent form,  will be provided a copy of the signed informed consent form, 
assigned a subject identifier, and an appointment will be scheduled for their Research Evaluation 1.  
 
Research Evaluations:  CS patients will undergo three separate research examinations during this study. Before 
commencing the RST program, an initial research examination (pulmonary function testing , functional speech/dyspnea 
measures ) will be completed. Af ter completing RST and before undergoing surgery, a second research examination 
(pulmonary function testing, FEES , functional speech/dyspnea measures ) will be completed. Finally, postoperatively, a 
third research examination (FEES) will be completed. The m ethods for the research examinations are outlined in detail 
below . 
 
Research Evaluation 1: As previously described, CS patients will undergo evaluations during the preoperative phase 
immediately before and after the RST program. Research evaluations will take approximately 30-45 minutes to 
complete. During these evaluations, the following procedures and outcomes will be collected:  
 
Pulmonary function testing (PFT):  Consistent with PFT protocols and the American Thoracic Society gu idelines, all PFT 
measures will be completed in an upright seated position with a nose clip.29,30 FVC will be measured with a handheld 
spirometer (Micro I; Carefusion,Yorba Linda, California).  For FVC, CS patients will be instructed to take a deep breath 
in, place their mouth around the mouthpiece, and blow all t he air our from their lungs.  MEP and MIP will be measured 
with the MicroRPM  handheld MEP device (Micro Direct Inc., Lewiston, ME). For MEP testing, CS patients will be 
instructed to place their mouth around the mouthpiece and blow out as forcefully as possible. For MIP testing, CS 
patients will be instructed to place their mouths  around the mouthpiece and breathe in as forcefully as possible. The 
participant will perform  up to  three trials of each task, inter -spaced with a one -minute rest in between. The highest 
value will be used for statistical analysis.  Voluntary cough PEF will  be tested using a handheld analog Mini -Wright Peak 
Cough Flow Meter (model number 3103085,  Clement Clarke Int., Harlow, United Kingdom). This device is considered 
the gold standard Peak Cough Flow (PCF) device and is one of the only PCF devices that conta ins a one -way expiratory 
valve that prevents a participant to breathe air in from the device to reduce contamination. Additionally, we will fit the 
PCF meter with a Mini -Wright disposable single -use bacterial expiratory one -way valve filter mouthpiece (mod el 
number 3122064) that traps any expectorated matter or organisms ensuring a barrier to the PCF meter device. This 
method conforms to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards for PCF testing. Participants will be instructed to 
“cough hard like someth ing is stuck in your throat.” The participant will perform three trials inter -spaced with a one -
minute rest in between. The outcome will be Peak Expiratory Flow  ((PEF) L/min). The highest obtained value will be 
used.  For cough spirometry testing, an oral p neumotachograph (MLT 1000; ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, 
Colorado) will be connected to a spirometry mouthpiece filter (MQ 304 Spirometer Filter; Vacumed; Ventura, 
California). Participants will be instructed to wrap their lips around the mouthpie ce and “cough hard like something is 
stuck in your throat.” Cough waveforms will be recorded using LabChart Version 7 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, 
Washington) and a laptop computer devoted to this study. Cough spirometry metrics will include inspiratory phas e 
duration, inspiratory peak flow rate, compression phase duration, expiratory rise time, peak expiratory flow rate, and 
cough volume acceleration. Up to t hree attempts will be elicited.  An example of voluntary cough spirometry waveform 
from a previous stu dy in our lab is provided in Fig. 5 and definitions for each outcome of interest is provided in Table 3 
below.

Note:  L=liters, s=seconds  
 
Functional Dyspnea Measure: Research participants will complete the London Chest Activity of Daily Living scale 
(LCADL), which is a standardized and validated 15 -item questionnaire that measures dyspnea during activities of daily 
living.32 
 
Speec h Measure:  The ‘Bamboo Passage’ is a validated speech testing item that consists of a 98-word  paragraph.33 It is 
used  to determine speaking rate, and number and duration of pauses during speech. Participant s will be instructed  to 
read the passage in their normal speaking rate and loudness. Speaking rate (words per minute), number of pauses, and 
duration of pauses will be calculated.   
 A digital audio recorder (TASCAM, DR40) connected to a condenser headset microph one (AKG, Inc., HSC271) with a 
lapel windscreen (eBoot, Inc.) will be placed on the participants head with the headset microphone at a standardized 
distance of 10cm from the right lip corner. Audio recordings will be digitized at 44.1 kHz with a 16 -bit qua ntization. 
Calibration of the microphone will be completed prior to each test. Speech testing items will be recorded and saved 
for subsequent offline analysis. Audio recordings obtained during speech testing will be blinded and rated in Audacity 
(Audacity 2.2.2, WordPress, 2018) for the below speech outcomes.   
 
Aim 2 Outcomes : Given our desire to index physiologic capacity, we will utilize the highest obtained outcome for FVC, 
MEP, MIP, cough PEF, and cough spirometry metrics at each time point before and after RST for statistical comparisons. 
LCADL ratings and speech measurements will also be compared before and after RST. We hypothesize that CS patients 
will improve FVC, MEP, MIP, cough PEF, cough spirometry metrics , dyspnea, and speaking rate/pauses  post -RST.  
 
RST Program and Telehealth /In-Person  Visits : 
RST Program:  Enrolled CS patients will undergo a preoperative RST program 
immediately following Research Evaluation 1 (preoperative, pre-RST)  with a 
targeted duration of 4 -weeks that will vary dependent upon available time 
between the patients preop and surgery schedule . RST will be completed from the 
patients’ home with portable expiratory and inspiratory training devices our lab 
has p reviously used: the EMST -150 or the EMST75 Lite  and the IA -150 devices 
(Aspire Products, Gainesville, Florida, Fig. 4). The EMST 75 Lite has a resistance 
range of 0 -75cm H 20 and  the EMST -150 and IA -150 devices have a resistance range 
of 30 to 150cm H 20 and represent spring -loaded  pressure threshold devices (Fig . 
4). For completion of exercises, each device will be set to a patient’s individualized 
70% MEP or MIP. Following the baseline evaluation, trainers will be calibrated to 
the appropriate setting , and the patient will be trained on how to perform 
exercises. Additionally, they will be provided with a training manual that includes 
detailed instructions and photographs to provide reinforcement of the initial 
training session.

 7 Participants will need t o demonstrate proficiency in performing both the expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) 
and inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) exercise prior to leaving the clinic and will be given a training log to 
record their daily sessions and a telehealt h appointment card with weekly meeting dates and instructions for how to 
access the secure telehealth portal (a secure version of Zoom).  
The RST protocol will be the previously utilized “Rule of 5’s” 13 that includes training 5 days per week and performing 5 
sets of 5 reps (i.e., 25 repetitions) for both expiratory and inspiratory muscle strength training. Thus, a total of 50 
repetitions (25 IMST, 25 EMST) will be performed by enrolled participants. CS p atients will be instructed to breathe in 
(IMST) or out (EMST) for several seconds until the valve audibly releases. Between repetitions, CS patients will be 
instructed to rest 10 -15 seconds before the next repetition. After each set, CS patients will be in structed to rest for one 
minute before completing the next set. Repetitions will be recorded in a training log provided to the CS patients to 
track adherence and the quality of repetitions will be monitored during weekly telehealth sessions.  
Tele health Sessions:  CS patients will complete one -five training session s per week via telehealth with a research 
speech -language pathologist  to ensure pa tients are using correct form and technique, to complete a safety and adverse 
event check, to answer any questions patients may have, and to assist with adherence issues.  The number of telehealth 
visits per week will be determined based on individual patie nt factors including 1) patient performance of the RST 
program, and 2) patient requests for additional training/clarification.  The research speech -language pathologist may 
recommend up to 5 telehealth visits per week and/or patients may request additional telehealth sessions (up to 5 per 
week) if they have questions or require additional support to perform the RST exercises corre ctly. EMST/IMST devices 
will also be recalibrated weekly using the Borg Category Ratio 10 Scale to measure perceived effort  of the RST exercise  
equal to 70% MEP/MIP  (Borg scale  score  of 7/10) . The Borg Category Ratio Scale has been used in the limb literat ure 
and demonstrated accuracy in measuring %repetition max (RM). For example , a score of 2 is approximately 20% of a 
RM and a score of 7 is approximately 70% of a RM.34 To ensure patient privacy, telehealth sessions will take place in a 
private room using a UF secure telehealth platform (a secure version of Zoom). Attendance for weekly telehealth 
sessions will be tracked.  
In-Person  Visit:  CS patients will also have one in -person visit  within participants’ homes or the research laboratory (DG -
136)  with a study team member  at the mid -point of the RST program to ensure patients are using correct form and 
technique, to complete a safety and adverse event check, to a nswer any questions patients may have, and to assist 
with adherence issues. EMST/IMST devices will also be recalibrated by retesting MEP and MIP and setting the devices 
to 70%.  LCADL ratings and functional speech measures (bamboo passage) will also be obta ined.  
Training Logs:  CS patients will fill out daily training logs to track RST repetitions (adherence) and to note any adverse 
events related to RST. The PI will calculate the total number of repetitions completed by each participant at the 
conclusion of the training period.   
 
Aim 1 Outcomes  will include patient adherence to RST, attendance at telehealth /in-person treatment  sessions, and 
adverse events associated with RST. We hypothesize that RST will be safe, well -tolerated, and feasible in CS patients as 
measured by high ad herence to RST, attendance at all telehealth /in-person  sessions, and no reported adverse events.  
 
Research Evaluation 2: 
After completing  the RST program  and prior to surgery , CS patients will undergo PFT s, read the bamboo passage, and 
complete the LCADL as they did during Research Evaluation 1. Additionally , they  will undergo a standardized 
Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES).  The second research evaluation will take approximately 45 
minutes to complete.  
 
Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES):  CS patients will undergo a FEES exam in a dedicated room (UB 
1707, UB 1739) in the preoperative clinic or the ARC lab before and after the RST program using an Olympus flexible 
video HD Rhino Laryngoscope (ENF -V3) connected  to a portable video processor and light source (Olympus CV170). To 
ensure patient comfort, a water -soluble lubricant (Aplicare sterile lubricating jelly 82 -280) and, per participant 
preference, a topical numbing -agent (i.e., lidocaine hydrochloride jelly USP, 2%) will be applied to the naris, and the 
laryngoscope will be passed trans -nasally through the nasopharynx and hypopharynx until an optimal position is 
obtained.35 The topical numbing agent will be used per participant preference and pending physician authorization. 
Safety, Feasibility, and Impact of Preoperative Respiratory Strength Training in Cardiac Surgical Patients  Protoco l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 8 During laryngoscope advancement, the participant may be asked to hum or say “eeeeee” to help visualize anatomy 
and placement o f the laryngoscope. A standardized FEES protocol will be used that includes a combination of voicing 
and swallowing tasks. Once optimal scope positioning is confirmed, the participant will be asked to perform a series of 
voicing tasks to allow assessment o f laryngeal and vocal fold movement that include: 1) sustained vowel “ah” 2) 
vowel/sniff alternating task; 3) cheek puff task; 4) breath hold task; and 5) a pitch glide of the vowel “e”. CS patients 
will be given 5ml Gatorade x2, 10ml Gatorade x2, comforta ble cup sip x2, teaspoon pudding x2, cracker x2, and M&Ms 
x3. A liquid that is colored needs to be used so that it may be visualized during swallowing. Gatorade will be the typical 
option but if a participant has dietary restrictions or a dislike for Gator ade other options will include grape juice or milk. 
To ensure patient safety, swallowing trials will be discontinued after two episodes of gross aspiration or if a patient is 
unable to clear >70% of the bolus. At the completion of the swallowing trials, th e laryngoscope will be carefully 
removed.  
 
Recordings will be saved on a USB200 recording device with an encrypted hard drive. The FEES images will be labeled 
with the participant identification study number and immediately transferred onto the Aerodigesti ve Research Core 
laboratory server to ensure data is not lost. This is a secure server and only individuals within the lab included on this 
IRB will have access to saved and coded files. The video images will remain on the encrypted hard drive until the en d 
of the study and then they will be deleted. The transferred recordings will be kept on our secure server for five years 
following the completion of the study. Additionally, if abnormalities are noted that would be pertinent to the 
participant’s medical c are (for example, vocal fold paralysis or aspiration), our study team will alert the medical team

Duplicate blinded ratings of the validated PAS, DIGEST, NZSS, and YRS will be performed by two experienced raters to 
index swallowing safety and efficiency (Tables 4 -7). If a discrepancy occurs, a consensus meeting will be held with four 
experienced raters  to finalize a rating.

Post operative  Research Evaluation 3:  
Following completion of the RST program and after cardiac surgery, patients will undergo a standardized FEES 
evaluation  that will take approximately 30 minutes  and health -related outcome measures will be tracked.  For 
postoperative FEES examinations, the PI  will ensure patient readiness and safety by completing a cognitive screen 
(Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale score of 0)39 and by determining the patient’s respiratory status is stable (Sp02 
>90%, off CPAP/BiPAP for >30 minute s, respiratory rate <30 bpm).  Table 8 shows a checklist for determining patient 
readiness for participating in a postoperative FEES.   
 
Following confirmation that the participant is appropriate to proceed to swallowing testing, the research SLP will the 
same standardized FEES protocol as described in the preoperative research exams and will be performed at the 
participant’s bedside.  Postoperative FEES examinations will be performed within 72 hours of extubation with CS 
patients sitting upright in bed.  During this period, the participant’s vital signs will be monitored and although not

 10 anticipated, testing will cease if a significant change is observed (Sp02<90, BR>30, spike in blood pressure or overt signs 
of distress) or if the participant wishes to end t esting early.

Domain:  Criteria:  
Alertness & Cognition:  ✓ Richmond Agitation - Sedation Scale of 0  
✓ Oriented to time and place  
✓ Alert and able to attend to conversation and follow commands  
Stable Respiratory Status:  ✓ Able to remain off CPAP or BiPAP support for >30 minutes  
✓ Demonstrates a respiratory rate <30  
Physical Ability:  ✓ Ability to sit upright for testing  
 
Swallowing measures : Two blinded judges will independently rate swallowing safety  and efficiency  using the validated 
penetration -aspiration scale (PAS), dynamic imaging grade of swallowing toxicity (DIGEST), the New Zealand secretion 
scale (NZSS), and the Yale pharyngeal residue severity rating scale (YRS) .36–38,40,41 These scales are described in detail 
above in Tables 4 -7. 
 
Health -related outcomes:  We will collect information on enrolled participants’ medical history via the University of 
Florida Heart and Vascular hospital electronic medical records (Epic, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI). Variables 
of interest may include previous  history of d ysphagia (y/n), previous cardiothoracic surgery (y/n), type of previous 
cardiothoracic surgery, previous cardiothoracic surgery notes, year of previous cardiothoracic surgery, dysphagia 
following previous cardiothoracic surgery (y/n), instrumental swallow evaluations after previous surgeries (y/n), 
primary surgery diagnosis , etc. Following surgery, enrolled participants will be closely monitored , and the following 
variables of interest will be tracked: time to oral diet, length of ICU and total hospital stay, intubation duration, 
extubation fast track status (y/n), pneumonia status, reintubation status, 30 -day readmission status, and 90 -day 
mortality status Epic . Given the nature of our therapy, a dditional metrics that provide insight into CS patients’ 
pulmo nary or swallow function may be extracted from respiratory therapists’ , speech -language pathologists, or other 
health care provider notes. These metrics may include things such as DLCO, respiratory rate, intubation duration, 
negative inspiratory force, instrumental swallow evaluation imaging (e.g., videofluoroscopy, FEES), etc. In addition to 
obtaining medical information from patients’ charts, t est results  from research evaluations  can be made available upon 
request to aid in medical care and reduce ris k of repetitive testing.   
 
Aim 3 Outcomes  will include the postoperative PAS , DIGEST, NZSS, and YRS  score s and the aforementioned health 
related outcomes of interest. We predict to see low rates of unsafe swallowing , and in those who do aspirate, we 
predict that they will demonstrate an adequate cough response to remove tracheal aspirate (PAS of 6). Further, we 
predict to observe low rates of pneumonia, reintubation, 30 -day readmission, and 90 -day mortality , as well a s 
decreased time to oral intake and LOS for enrolled participants during their recovery.  
 
Sample size justification: Given that this is a pilot study to determine primarily safety and feasibility data to determine 
whether a large -scale clinical trial is wa rranted, a justification based on statistical power to test hypotheses strictly at 
the α=0.05 level is not appropriate. The findings from this exploratory study will be used to perform future sample size 
and power calculations to examine the safety, feasib ility, and impact of preoperative RST in a larger cohort of CS 
patients.  
 
Statistical analyses:  Descriptive statistics, magnitudes of estimates, and spaghetti and needle plots that visualize 
individual -level data across time points will first be utilized t o summarize data in this small cohort and prior to 
performing conventional analyses and hypothesis testing.  
Aim 1:  Attendance, RST adherence, and adverse events will be summarized descriptively with frequency counts and 
percentages.  
Safety, Feasibility, and Impact of Preoperative Respiratory Strength Training in Cardiac Surgical Patients  Protoco l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 11 Aim 2 : Descriptive statistics and an appropriate repeated measures analysis based on the distribution of data will be 
used to evaluate potential change in FVC, MEP, MIP, voluntary cough peak expiratory flow, and cough spirometry 
metrics , speech rate , number of p auses, duration of pauses, LCADL ratings  across time points (pre -RST vs. post -RST).  
Aim 3: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize swallowing safety profiles postoperatively (frequency 
histogram, mean, mode, range of PAS , DIGEST, NZSS, YRS  scores) , and logistic regression will be used to compare 
swallowing safety  and efficiency  across timepoints.42 Postoperative rates of pneumonia, reintubation, duration of 
intubation, intubation fast track status, any related respiratory therapy outcomes, 30-day readmission, mortality, and 
time to oral intake/hospital LOS , etc.  will be summarized descriptively (frequency counts, %) and compared to our 
historical data set in CS patients.  
 
Data Management  and Quality Control : Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) will be used to enter and store 
data for the current study, which is a secure web -based application  hosted at the University of Florida . REDCap has a 
variety of features that streamline data entry and processing including the ability to download and export data directly 
to commonly used statistical analyses software. The ARC lab has successfully used REDCap for data collection, storage, 
and analyses for other research studies

Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP):  Dr. Jeng  will provide medical oversight for this study and we will utilize standard 
IRB oversight to monitor any adverse events or protocol deviations.  The UF -IRB will review the human subject protocol 
and will monitor the quality of research occurring under the approved protocol during annual continuing reviews. The 
IRB must approve the protocol annually, as the study progresses. Data safety monitoring will occur during weekly 
meetings to review Adverse Events (AE) and Protocol Deviation Logs with the PI and stud y team.  In the event of an 
unanticipated adverse response, the participant’s physician will be immediately notified, and the participant will be 
seen for a complete evaluation. Data, adverse events, and individual subject safety are monitored throughout ea ch 
subject’s evaluation as well as during weekly laboratory meetings with the PI and study team that adhere to the UF IRB 
regulations for reporting of AE’s and protocol deviations.  
 
Potential Risks : All participants will be required to pass a COVID -19 Test  (i.e., COVID -19 negative) that is performed as 
standard of care in all surgical patients prior to being allowed to participate in this study. Thus, the risk for personal 
working on this project, in addition to potential cross contamination of equipment wi ll not be a factor.  
The following risks will be disclosed to all participants prior to obtaining their consent to participate:  
a) A Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) can result in in discomfort, gagging or vomiting. 
Although extremely rare other complications that have been reported can include vasovagal episode (0.06% 
Safety, Feasibility, and Impact of Preoperative Respiratory Strength Training in Cardiac Surgical Patients  Protoco l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 12 reported incidence), laryngospasms (0.03% rep orted incidence), or epistaxis (0.3% reported incidence). The 
reported incidences of these adverse reactions to FEES are based on published reports in 6,000 patients.35 
b) Aspiration (material in trachea) is always a possible risk during the FEES  exam, as the test is intended to detect 
aspiration during swallowing.  
c)  There are no documented complications of voluntary cough spirometry  or pulmonary fu nction testing . 
d) While RST has been safe and well -tolerated in a variety of patient populations,13,14,16 –18,20,21 there is a chance it 
could result in d izziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, or shortness of breath.  
 
Potential Benefits:  Subjects may potentially benefit from participation through improved breathing, cough, and/or 
swallowing function. Participating in this study will  also include an instrumenta l swallowing evaluation following 
surgery and may lead to the early identification of any swallowing impairments to minimize adverse effects of 
swallowing difficulty and to initiate preventative measures for risk of choking, respiratory difficulty and/or p neumonia 
post -operatively. Additionally, study participation may lead to sooner oral intake of food, liquids , and medications while 
in the hospital as a result of comprehensive swallowing testing being performed post -extubation.  
 
Conflict of Interest:  There is no conflict of interest to disclose for any study team member that is specifically relevant 
to this study.  
 
Summary and Conclusions: This pilot study represents the first examination of the feasibility, safety, and physiologic 
impact of a targeted  preoperative RST program in a small group of high -risk CS patients to prevent postoperative 
dysphagia and associated adverse outcomes. By carefully examining detailed aspects of physiology and health -related  
outcomes in a feasible design for this grant me chanism, the PI will collect high quality data to support her K99 -R00 NIH 
grant application. These preliminary data will further inform future intervention paradigms in this challenging patient 
population where there is no current standard of care or evide nce guided intervention guidelines for either pre or 
postoperative dysphagia management.11,12

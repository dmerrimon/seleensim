ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 5 of 19 2 Introduction  
2.1  Background  
Sutures and metal staples are considered standard of care methods for surgical skin closure.  The Zip® 
Surgical Skin Closure device from ZipLine Medical, Inc. (Campbell, CA USA) is a more recent method of skin 
closure that utilizes skin adhesive and adjust able ratcheting straps to achieve and maintain tension necessary 
for wound closure and healing.  The Zip device was designated Class I, 510(k) Exempt by the US FDA in 2010, 
and the CE Mark was affixed in 2014.  Clinical studies comparing the Zip device to staples and sutures have 
demonstrated several benefits, including:  
• Fewer wound -related readmissions compared to staples on TKA patients1 
• Can eliminate a home health nurse visit compared to staples on TKA patients2 
• 3x faster wound closure compared to subcut icular sutures on pacemaker patients3 
• Superior cosmetic scar quality compared to subcuticular suture for pediatric cardiac sternotomy 
patients4 
• Less patient pain during removal compared to subcuticular suture (Prolene®) for pediatric cardiac 
sternotomy pat ients5 
• Superior protection of wound from extrinsic distraction forces compared to sutures6 
Limited patient -reported satisfaction data exists for the Zip device as compared to staples and sutures, so 
this study will attempt to address this need.  
2.2 Purpose of the study  
To evaluate patient satisfaction of closure method used after knee joint arthroplasty .  Metal staples and the 
Zip® Surgical Skin Closure device are approved methods in regular use.  Selection of method is generally 
based on physician preference.  This study is to determine what, if any, differences exist in patient 
satisfaction amongst the t wo methods.

ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 6 of 19 3 Device Description  
3.1  Device Overview  
ZipLine Medical, Inc. has developed a novel, non -invasive skin closure device called “Z ip Surgical Skin Closure” 
to replace sutures, staples and glue for closure of the skin layer for surgical incisions or laceration repair.  The 
device is designed to provide closure speed superior to sutures, while resulting in a suture -like cosmetic 
outcom e.  Both pre -clinical feasibility study data and feedback from over 2000 human cases during the 
device’s commercial use in the USA suggest that these design intentions are correct.  This study will test 
these assertions in a controlled clinical setting, wi th the goal of providing results with statistical significance .     
The Zip device is a single use, sterile medical device.  
 
 
Figure 1. Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device  
 
The Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device is applied to clean, dr y skin after deeper tension -relieving (i.e., dermal or 
subcutaneous) sutures have been applied.  
 
The device adheres to the skin adjacent to an incision by use of pressure -sensitive skin adhesives.  A 
combination of acrylic and hydrocolloid adhesives are us ed to provide a skin -friendly environment while 
providing the necessary tack to maintain skin adhesion during the recommended wear time of the device. 
The Zip device will be placed on the incision  as the  surgeon approximates the incision edges and tensions the 
wound by adjusting the ratcheting straps located along the device.  Once the desired tension is  achieved, the 
excess strap ends are trimmed with scissors, and a conventional absorptive dressing may be applied.   The Zip 
will remain on the skin for 3 weeks, at which point it will be removed.   
 
 

 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 7 of 19  
Figure 2. Adjusting Incision Closure Tension  
 
After application , patients may shower (but not soak in a tub or pool) with the device on.  The device is 
removed by lifting the edge of the device and gently peeling along the incision, taking care not to apply stress 
to the incision.  If there is a risk of skin stripping, an adhesive removal agent may be used during removal.  
 
 
Figu re 3. Key Components of the Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device  
In addition to the pressure -sensitive adhesives, the device’s closure and force distribution components are 
made up of polyurethane monofilm, polyethylene tape, polyester  and nylon.

5.4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Candidates for the study must not meet any of the following criteria.  If any one of the following is met, the 
patient is not eligible to participate in the study.  
 
1. Patients that do not meet the conditions listed in the wound closure device warnings, 
prec autions, and contraindications  (Appendix A ) 
2. Patients with comorbidities or conditions that the investigator deems to be ineligible for the 
study  
3. Patients without the capacity to give informed consent (e.g., dementia)  
6 Study Phases  
The study will be conducted in phases as subjects are consented, determined eligible by meeting the study 
selection criteria, receive treatment and followed as standard after the  arthroplasty  procedure and exited from the 
study  
6.1 Screen / Informed Consent Pr ocess  
Patients considered to be eligible candidates for the study will be approached to understand their willingness 
and interest of volunteering for the study.  The informed consent process will then be performed in the 
following manner:  
 
Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained as outlined in 21 CFR Part 50 and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guidance (ICH, April 1996).  
 
Eligible patients will be introduced to the study opportunity during a pre -operative visit.  Patients will be 
given the o pportunity to have their questions answered, either at the time of their visit, or after the visit via 
phone or email .  Patients will be given the opportunity to provide consent at the time of their visit or at a 
later time if they need time to consider pa rticipating.  A research study member at the approved study site 
will speak with the study candidate about the purpose of the study.  Explanation of the study background, 
study procedure, follow up visit schedule, study procedure risks and benefits will be  reviewed in detail with 
the patient.  Patients will be given the time they need to read through the study information and informed 
consent document and ask as many questions as necessary to make them comfortable with the study and 
the requirements.  
 
For those potential candidates who agree to participate in the study by signing the IRB approved Informed 
Consent Form (ICF), a baseline evaluation will be conducted .  Consent may be obtained by the investigator or 
staff member authorized by the investigator.   
 
If a patient does not have the capacity to give informed consent, they will be excluded from consideration for 
enrollment.  If an enrolled subject loses the capacity to reasonably complete the study questionnaire surveys 
during the study, they shall be discharged from the study.  
 
The investigator will ensure that prospective subjects have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the 
information represented by the elements of informed consent to enable them to make an informed and 
enlightened decision w hether or not to participate or allow participation in research. The investigator shall, 
based on clinical judgment, determine if the study candidate  understood the information presented  
 
The investigator shall be responsible for ensuring that valid consen t is obtained and documented for all 
subjects. All study records including the completed consent forms and patient satisfaction  questionnaires 
shall be maintained in a secure location in the investigator’s clinic and handled in a manner that maintains 
conf identiality of the data.   
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 10 of 19 6.2 Baseline Evaluation  / Eligibility Determination / Enrollment  
The study investigator or study staff member will conduct a formal evaluation for study eligibility which may 
include reviewing medical history and understanding genera l health.  When the subject is determined eligible 
and scheduled for the arthroplasty procedure they will be enrolled into the study.   
6.3 Random Assignment  
The subject will be randomized to a closure assignment prior to the procedure .  A study staff member will 
open a sealed randomization envelope consisting of closure assignment and a subject study identification 
number.  The subject is considered enrolled into the study at this time and the subject disposition will be 
accounted for in study reports.    
 
Subjects will be assigned in consecutive order in a 1:1 ratio for closure assignment (Metal Staples:Zip Closure 
Device) until all subjects are enrolled.  
 
6.4 Procedure  
Arthroplasty will be performed as standard and the assigned closure method will be applied  and documented 
on the procedure Case Report Form (CRF) .  Subjects will be reminded of their follow -up visits to the study 
office.  
6.5 Follow Up / Study Exit  
The follow -up period of the study will begin after the arthroplasty pro cedure.  All follow -up visits will be 
scheduled from the date of the arthroplasty procedure and should be within the study visit windows as 
indicated in the Table of Assessments (Table 1).  
6.6 Study Evaluations and Assessments  
The following assessments will b e made during each study visit:  
 
 Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire  – to evaluate subject experience and outcome of incision closure  
 
POSAS (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) – the subject and investigator will rate  commonly 
described scar characteristics from a patient and observers perspective .

7 Subject Compensation  
Participating study subjects will not incur any costs as a result of  participating in the study and will not receive 
reimbursement or payments for participation.  
 
8 Study Withdrawal  
Subjects may be terminated or withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
• Voluntary withdrawal – meaning that the subject voluntarily c hooses not to further participate in the study  
• Lost to follow -up – meaning that the subject is more than one month late (beyond the late visit window) to 
a study visit and 3 documented attempts to contact the subject are unsuccessful.  A subject who misses  a 
study visit but attends a subsequent visit will no longer be considered lost to follow -up. 
• In the physician’s opinion, it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue study participation.  
• Subject death.   
 
 
Any study subject who does not attend a scheduled follow -up visit should be contacted by site personnel to 
determine the reason for the missed appointment(s).  The reason for the missed visit should be determined and 
documented in the subject’s study records.  All subjects enrolled (inc luding those withdrawn or lost to follow -up) 
shall be accounted  for with appropriate documentation .  
 
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 12 of 19 9 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the procedure phase or the follow -up phase of the study.  Adverse events 
occurring after the baseline  assessment but before the arthroplasty procedure will be documented in the subject’s 
medical record but will not count as related to the closure device.   
Each adverse event will be recorded in the corresponding subject’s CRF.  Each adverse event will be judged by the 
Investigator as to its relationship and level of relatedness to the closure device .  In addition, the Investigator will 
identify the date of onset, severity and duration of the AE.  All adverse events will be monitored until they are 
adequat ely resolved or explained.  If a subject reaches the final follow -up visit and is experiencing a new or ongoing 
adverse event, the study sponsor should be contacted to discuss the need and/or methods for continued surveillance 
of the event.  
The Investigato r must submit to the Sponsor a report of any Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Device 
Effect (SADE) or Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) within 24 hours  of knowledge of the event.

11 Methods and Procedures   
1. Study investigator and designated staff shall be trained on study procedures by the sponsor or sponsor 
delegate.  
 
2. Patients shall be screened prior to surgery for study eligibility by the investigator or staff member 
designated by the investigator.  
 
3. Eligible patients shall be presented with the study opportunity during a pre -operative consultation visit to 
the study si te, and will be given the opportunity to read the informed consent form and receive answers 
to any questions about the study.  If the patient is able and willing to participate, they will sign the 
consent form and become an enrolled subject.  
 
4. Randomization  will be assigned in permuted block so that even numbers of each closure method is 
assigned  
 
5. Immediately after the arthroplasty procedure the assigned closure method will be applied and 
documented on the procedure data form  
 
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 13 of 19 6. During the subject’s scheduled (i.e., standard of care)  3-week post -operative clinic visit and immediately 
AFTER  the wound closure device is removed (e.g., Zip  or staples), clinic staff will:  
a. Administer the first patient satisfaction questionnaire  
b. POSAS will be performed by an impartial rater    
c. Photograph the scar in a well -lighted room at a distance of approximately 12 -14”, capturing the 
entire scar.  Ensure the knee joint is flexed at approximately 45 degrees for the photo.  
 
7. During the subject’s scheduled (i.e., standard of ca re) 6-week post -operative clinic visit, clinic staff will : 
a. Administer the second patient satisfaction survey  
b.  POSAS will be performed by an impartial rater    
c. Photograph the scar in a well -lighted room at a distance of approximately  12-14”, capturing the 
entire scar.   Ensure the knee joint is flexed at approximately 45 degrees for the photo.  
 
8. Once enrollment is complete and all subjects have completed the patient satisfaction  questionnaires , the 
data will be analyzed and results will be evaluated by the investigator.  
12 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Risk Category.  This is a minimal risk study. T he probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in 
the research are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine 
physical or psychological examinations or tests.  
Potential risks associated  with the use of the closure methods in this study as standard of care do not differ from 
those commonly used for closing wounds, incisions or lacerations.   
 
Potential risks associated with the closure methods used in this study  are listed below.  Subject s will be monitored 
closely as part of this study to allow for detection of symptoms, should they be present.  This, in turn, should allow 
for early treatment or intervention, if necessary.  
The following are side effects that may occur as a result of use of closure methods used to repair incisions  after the 
arthroplasty procedure :  
• Blistering from overtightening of the Zip Closure D evice causing excessive stretch force applied to the 
epidermis  
• Edema which can cause skin shearing, skin blistering or loss of  adhesion to occur  
• Skin stripping upon removal as a result of any surgical tape or adhesive applied to skin  
• Allergic reaction to the adhesive product including hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation following 
removal  
• Infection resulting from any bacteria in troduced into the incision  
• Dehiscence requiring intervention  
• Device failure / malfunction  
• Edema  
• Wound site pain / discomfort  
• Excessive scarring including:  
o Step -off 
o Contour irregularities  
o Excessive distortion  
o Poor cosmetic appearance  
Protection Against Risks  
This is a minimal risk study.  Nonetheless, all efforts will be made to minimize any potential risk . Risks will be 
minimized through the use of  an Investigator with a high degree of experience in orthopaedic surgery.  The 
Investigator has received sponsor -led training in proper use of the device, prior to study initiation and as 
warranted throughout the study.  The sponsor will monitor the study for any trends that would indicate a safety 
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 14 of 19 issue.    
Potential Risks to Patient Confidentiality  
In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information may be breached due to study -related 
activities beyond those of routine clinical care .  This risk will be minimized by not collecting personally identifying 
information on Case Report Forms (CRFs) or other study -related documentation to be provided to the study 
sponsor  
Potential Benefits to the Subjects  
There are no potential benefits to t he subjects other than the satisfaction of having helped improve the body of 
knowledge on the study subject, which may lead to future preference towards a super ior wound closure modality 
in a subsequent surgery .  
Alternatives to Participation  
Since this is  a patient -participation survey and not an experimental study, the only alternative to participation is to 
not participate .  
13 Quality Assurance and Supervision by Authorities  
This study will be conducted in accordance with elements of E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, ICH, 
April 1996, abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b) for Non -significant Risk (NSR) device studies, the 
Declaration of Helsinki, the Belmont Report, and IRB/EC requirements.  
 
All documents and data shall be produced and maintained in such a way to assure control of documents and data to 
protect the patient’s privacy as far as reasonably practicable.  The Sponsor and representatives of the FDA or other 
regulatory authorities are permitted to inspect the study documents (e.g., study protocol, CRFs, and original study -
relevant medical records/files) as needed.  All attempts will  
be made to preserve patient confidentiality.  
 
The clinical site  is subject to audit by study sponsor personnel or designee for protocol  adherence, accuracy of CRFs 
and compliance with applicable regulations.  Any evident pattern of non -compliance with respect to these standards 
will be cause for corrective action.  
 
The study protocol, data -recording procedures, data handling as well as st udy reports are subject to an independent

The rights, safety and well-being  of clinical investigation subjects shall be protected consistent  with the ethical 
principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.  This shall be understood, observed and applied at every step in 
this clinical investigation.  
 
It is expected that all parties will share in the responsibility for ethical conduct in ac cordance with their respective 
roles in the investigation.  The Sponsor and the Investigator shall avoid improper influence or inducement of the 
patient, study monitor, clinical investigator or other parties participating in or contributing to the clinical  
investigation.   
 
15 Patient Confidentiality  
At all times throughout the clinical investigation, confidentiality will be observed by all parties involved.  All data 
shall be secured against unauthorized access.  Privacy and confidentiality of information about each patient shall be 
preserved in the r eports and in any publication.  Each patient participating in this study will be assigned a unique 
identifier.  All CRFs will be tracked, evaluated, and stored using only this unique identifier.   
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 15 of 19 The study site will maintain a confidential study patient l ist (paper or electronic) identifying all enrolled patients.  
This list will contain the assigned study patient’s unique identifier and name.  The Site Principal Investigator (PI) bears 
responsibility for keeping this list confidential.  This list will not  be provided to the study sponsor and is only to be 
used at the study center.  
Monitors and auditors will have access to the study patient list and other personally identifying information of study 
patients to ensure that data reported in the CRF correspond s to the person who signed the ICF and the information 
contained in the original source documents.  Such personal identifying information may include, but is not limited 
to the patient’s name, address, date of birth, gender, race and medical record number.    
 
NOTE:  The patient’s name, medical record number or address will NOT be recorded in the monitor’s visit report or 
the database; demographic data that may be recorded includes age, race, and gender.   
Any source documents copied for monitoring purposes by the Sponsor will have patient identifiable information 
redacted and be identified by using the assigned patient’s unique identifier in an effort to protect patient 
confidentiality.  
 
16 Data Analysis and Data Monitoring  
The study sponsor or designated clinical research associate or professional, shall monitor the site regulatory study 
documents and study data as needed.  All study records including the completed patient satisfaction  
questionnaires shall be maintained in a secure location in the investigator’s clinic and handled in a manner that 
maintains confidentiality of the data .  Data analysis shall be performed by the study statistician using appropriate 
analysis tools.    
17 Data Storage and Conf identiality

location in the investigator’s clinic and handled in a manner that maintains confidentiality of the data .   
 
18 Definitions and Acronyms  
Adverse Events  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  – any untoward medical occurrence in a subject (ISO 14155).   
NOTE:  This definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device under 
investigation.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  – an adverse event that (ISO 14155):  
• led to a death,  
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject,  
• resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
• required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or function,  
• led to fetal distress, fetal death, a congenital abnormality, or birth defect.   
 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  – any untoward and unintended response to a medical device (ISO 14155)  
NOTE: This includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the 
deployment of the device.  This definition  also includes any event that is a result of user error.  
 
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 16 of 19 Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  – an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these conseque nces if suitable action had 
not been taken or intervention had not been made or if circumstances had been less opportune (ISO 14155).  
 
Anticipated Adverse Device Effect (AADE)  – an adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity or 
outcome h as been previously identified in the previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application   
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  – any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -thre atening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or appl ication), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21CFR812.3.s and ISO 14155).  
NOTE: The occurrence of a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre -existing co ndition, unless the 
condition becomes more severe or increases in frequency, would not be considered procedure or device -related.

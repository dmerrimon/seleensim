Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
7  This SAD study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of single doses of galidesivir vs. placebo 
administered as IV infusions in healthy subjects enrolled in up to four dose cohorts of 8 subjects each. 
A single dose of  study drug will be administered per cohort: 6 subjects will receive galidesivir  IV, and 
2 subjects will receive matching placebo.   
The planned cohorts are as follows: 
• Cohort 1, Regimen A: 5 mg/kg galidesivir  or placebo, IV infusion × 1 dose 
• Cohort 2, Reg imen B: 10 mg/kg galidesivir  or placebo, IV infusion × 1 dose 
• Cohort 3, Regimen C: 15 mg/kg galidesivir  or placebo, IV infusion × 1 dose 
• Cohort 4, Regimen D: 20 mg/kg galidesivir  or placebo, IV infusion × 1 dose 
Study drug will be infused IV over 60 minutes at a  maximum infusion rate of 8.33 mL/min.   
As a safety precaution, on the first day of dosing in all cohorts, only 2 subjects will be dosed (to be referred to as sentinel subjects). The randomization schedule  will be constructed such that 1  of the 
sentinel subjects dosed on the first day will be randomized to receive galidesivir and 1 will be randomized to receive placebo. After review of the safety data from the 24 -hour post- dose period for 
the sentinel subjects, which includes review of any AEs, any abnormalities in the bedside ECGs, 
safety laboratory assessments and vital signs  as described in Section 7.6 .1, the remainder of the cohort 
(5 subjects randomized to galidesivir; 1  randomized to placebo) will be dosed at least 2 days after the 
sentinel subjects. 
Following a 28-day screening period to determine eligibility, subjects in each cohort will be admitted 
to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1. Study eligibility will be confirmed upon admission to 
the CRU, and subjects will remain in the CRU  overnight prior to dosing on Day 1. Following 
administration of study drug on Day 1, subjects will remain in the CRU for 96 hours to enable 
colle ction of PK samples and safety and tolerability data. Subjects will be discharged from the CRU 
on Day 5, 96 hours after the start of the infusion. Subjects will return to the CRU  for a brief visit 
(approximately 1 to 2 hours) for PK sample collection on Da y 6 (+  1 day), Day 8 (+  1 day), and Day 
14 (± 1 day). Subjects will return to the CRU  for a final follow -up visit on Day 21 (+ 2 days). In the 
event that there are any unresolved safety findings that are ongoing at Day 21, the subject will be 
followed at a dditional study visits until the findings are resolved or stabilized. If it is determined that 
the median half -life is longer than anticipated following IV infusion, or if after obtaining PK data 
through 96 hours, the area under the concentration- time curv e (AUC) extrapolated to infinity (AUC
inf) 
estimate is > 25% of the AUC from time  0 to the last measurable concentration of drug (AUC last), 
serial PK sampling may be extended beyond 96 hours in subsequent cohorts, or additional samples may be added in the intervening period between discharge from the CRU  and the final follow -up visit 
at Day 21 (+2 days).   
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through assessments of AEs, laboratory analyses (clinical 
chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, creatine kinase- MB [CK -MB], troponin ), vital signs, 
ECGs, ECHOs, cardiac telemetry, and PE examination findings at the time points indicated in the 
schedule of assessments. PK parameters will be analyzed from the plasma and urine samples collected at the t ime points indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
Dose Escalation Decision Process: Enrollment of subjects in each sequential higher dose level cohort 
will occur only after completion of a clinical safety review of laboratory, AE, vital sign, ECG 
(12-lead and telemetry), and PE data for all subjects up through 96 hours post-dose and plasma PK 
data through 24 hours post -dose, by the Sponsor medical monitor , clinical pharmacologist, and 
principal investigator (PI) at a dose escalation review meeting. Safety data summaries will be prepared by the PI; PK analyses will be performed by the clinical pharmacologist; and the dose 
escalation safety review summary and decision will be documented by the PI and clinical 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
8  pharmacologist. Based upon safety review and ev aluation of the data for each subject, adjustments in 
the dose escalation scheme for the next cohort may be made, including omission of higher dose 
cohorts in the event that the safety and PK parameters have been adequately characterized with lower dose cohorts. Where considered appropriate to meet the study objectives, adjustments in the protocol -
specified dose escalation for subsequent cohorts are permissible (i .e., an intermediate dose between 
the previous tolerable dose and the scheduled next higher dose). Dose escalation will be stopped if 
any one of the stopping criteria are met. The highest dose stated in the protocol will not be exceeded 
without a protocol amendment.   
Criteria for stopping dose escalation  for review of the PK and safety data : 
• One or more subjects with a treatment -emergent QT interval corrected by Fridericia's 
formula (QTcF) > 480 ms (Grade 2 per the DMID scale) as determined from bedside 
ECGs (with repeat ECG). If this occurs, the SMC may consult with an independent 
cardiologist as n eeded.  If it is deemed acceptable to restart the study following review of 
the data and discussion with an independent cardiologist, if needed, dosing may resume. 
• One or more subjects experiences an increase in BP that requires acute treatment, or has a 
confirmed systolic BP > 160  mmHg, or a confirmed diastolic BP > 100  mmHg (Grade 3 
per DMID scale). Confirmed BP changes require at least 2 measurements at least 2 hours apart, each measured after at least 5 minutes of supine rest.  
• Anaphylactic reaction occu rs in 1 subject. 
• One or more subjects experience a similar Grade 3 treatment- emergent laboratory 
abnormality or AE that is suspected to be drug- related as determined by the investigator.  
• One subject experiences an SAE.  
• A cohort’s median AUC from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 24) is ≥ 52,500 ng.h/mL, 
equivalent to the NOAEL exposure in cynomolgus monkeys.   
Sample Size Justification: 
No formal power or sample size calculations were used to determine cohort sizes. Cohort sizes were 
based upon experience in other SAD Phase 1 studies. A sample size of 6 subjects receiving active 
drug per cohort should provide adequate characterization of PK and safety assessments within this 
setting.

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration:  
Galidesivir for IV infusion: galidesivir is dissolved in Sterile Water for Injection United States 
Pharmacopeia (USP) with a pH adjusted to 3.0. For the 60 -minute IV infusion the drug product will 
be further diluted in Lactated Ringer’s (LR) solution (USP) to achieve a solution with pH of 
approximately 4.0 to 5.0.   
Duration of treatment:  
Single dose administration of galidesivir via a 60 -minute infusion.   
For e ach cohort, a subject’s participation is anticipated to be approximately 7 weeks, including 
screening and the follow-up period. 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Matched placebo for IV infusion to match active treatment. The placebo will be  LR solution (USP).  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety: AEs, laboratory analyses (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, CK -MB, 
troponin) , vital signs, ECGs, ECHOs, cardiac telemetry, and physical examination s. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
11  PK: Venous blood samples will be collected via an indwelling cannula or by venipuncture at regular 
intervals throughout the study. The plasma concentration data for galidesivir will be analyzed using 
non-compartmental techniques to obtain estimates of standard non-compartm ental PK parameters, 
including:  maximum concentration (C max), last measurable concentration of drug (C last), time to 
maximum concentration (T max), AUC last, AUC inf, clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V z), 
percentage of AUC extrapolated between AUC last and AUC inf (AUC extrap), λ z, and half -life (t 1/2), and 
other parameters, where appropriate. 
Plasma Sampling:  
Samples will be collected pre-dose, 30 min (halfway through the infusion), 1 h (end of the infusion), 
1.25 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h,16 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h, 72 h, and 96 h following the start of the infusion.  All sampling times are in relation to the start of the infusion.   
After discharge from the CRU, subjects will return to the CRU for a brief visit (approximately 1-2 
hours) for PK sample collection on Day 6 (+ 1 day), Day 8 (+  1 day) and Day 14 (± 1 day). A PK 
sample will also be collected at  the Day 21 (+ 2 days) follow-up visit or early termination visit (if 
applicable) .   
Urine Sampling: 
Predose, 0–12 h, 12 –24 h, 24–48 h, 48–72 h, 72–96 h.    
Statistical methods:  
Safety:  
AEs will be mapped to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term 
(PT) and system organ classification (SOC). Any event reported on the subject’s study record that 
occurs on or after the initiation of study drug is defined as treatment emergent. Additionally, it is assumed that an AE that is reported to have started on Day 1 of a given treatment period without an 
associated onset time may have occurred after the initiation of study drug. Hence, AEs occurring on 
Day 1 with no associated onset time will be assumed to be treatment emergent. The occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by cohort and treatment assignment  using MedDRA PT, 
SOC, and severity .  Separate summaries of treatment -emergent SAEs and AEs considered to be 
related to study drug will be generated. All AEs will be listed for individual subjects showing both verbatim and preferred terms.  
Descriptive summaries of vital signs, ECG parameters (12- lead and telemetry), ECHOs, and clinical 
laboratory results will be presented separately for each cohort by study visit  and treatment 
assignment . Laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the modified DMID criteria (2014) 
in APPENDIX A. 
Physical examination results will be presented in listings.   
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization D ictionary. These data 
will be summarized by cohort and treatment assignment . 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Concentrations of galidesiv ir will be determined by validated plasma and urine assays and will be 
summarized by treatment and displayed in figures. Plasma PK parameters for each subject will be 
estimated over the sampling interval using noncompartmental analysis (Phoenix WinNonlin 
Version  7.0 or higher, Certara ) and summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. The 
amount and percentage of galidesivir excreted in the urine will be assessed at all doses.   
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
12  Dose proportionality will be evaluated over all doses and will be based upon AUC inf, AUC from time  0 
to time “t”  (AUC t), and C max using both the power model and the analysis of variance method.

23  4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  
Marburg virus (MARV) belongs to the Filoviradae family of viruses.  Diseases caused by 
filoviruses are  among the most lethal of primate pathogens ( Changula, Kajihara et al. 2014) . 
MARV is the causative agent of Marburg Virus disease (MVD ), which was first discovered in 
1967 with a simultaneous outbreak in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany and Belgrade, Serbia that was tied to use of nonhuman primates that were  imported from Uganda. The natural host for 
the virus is thought to be fruit bats, with transmission to humans occurring from fruit bats, and then subsequent human- to-human transmission. Since that initial outbreak, outbreaks of MVD 
infections in humans have been sporadic and unpredictable , similar to o utbreaks of other 
filovirus diseases. Mortality from MVD is high; case- fatality rates range from 23%  to 88% 
(Kuhn, Dodd et al. 2011, CDC 2014, WHO 2017) .   
No specific treatments are currently available for filovirus diseases.  In recent filovirus 
outbreaks, such as the Sudan Ebola virus disease (EVD)  outbreak in 2014, both vaccines and 
direct antivirals have been investigated in clinical studies ( Cross, Mire et al. 2018) . After the 
outbreak, vaccines have been a focus for prevention of E VD, with several vaccines in 
development. Both medical countermeasures and vaccines that are effective against multiple 
filoviruses, are of interest for MVD .   
Galidesivir (also referred to as BCX4430 in study titles, study reports and supporting documents) 
is an adenosine analog that inhibits viral ribonucleic acid (RNA)- dependent RNA polymerase 
activity, and is being developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( BioCryst, the Sponsor of this 
study) as a direct -acting antiviral drug ( Julander, Bantia et al. 2012, Warren, Wells et al. 2014). 
The drug is curren tly being developed as an intravenous (IV) formulation as a post-exposure 
prophylaxis and for the treatment of confirmed or suspected MVD. 
4.2. Nonclinical Findings  
The results of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology studies of galide sivir are described briefly below; details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
Nonclinical in  vivo safety pharmacology and PK studies and in vitro safety pharmacology 
studies detailed in the IB support clinical studies with galidesivir  as a parenterally administered 
antiviral drug . 
4.2.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Galidesivir is a novel adenosine nucleoside analog, which inhibits viral RNA polymerase activity 
indirectly through non-obligate RNA chain termination. This mechanism involves anabolism of galidesivir  to BCX4430 triphosphate (BCX6870). Galidesivir has broad- spectrum antiviral 
activity against bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, coronaviruses, and 
flaviviruses ( Warren, Wells et al. 2014) . In MARV- infected HeLa cells, galidesivir reduced 
production of intracellular MARV RNA, and reduced production of infectious virus (inhibitory concentration 90% value of 5.4 µM). Galidesivir decreased expression of MARV glycoprotein on the cell surface in virus-infected cells (effective concentration 50% values of 4.4, 6.7, and 
5.0 µM for MARV Musoke, Ci67, and Angola variants, respectively) (Warren, Wells et al. 
2014) . 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
24  Galidesivir has been administered parenterally (intramuscular [ IM], IV, or intraperitoneal [IP]) in 
multiple experiments conducted in nonclinical filovirus disease models. Reproducible evidence 
of efficacy was observed in the established mouse model that utilizes an Ebola Zaire Mayinga variant, adapted for pathogenicity in mice by serial passage ( Bray, Davis et al. 1999, Warfield, 
Bradfute et al. 2009 ), with clear dose- related effects and statistically significant protection when 
dosing is delayed up to 96 hours post- infection. Similarly, galidesivir administration in 
nonclinical species infect ed with either mouse-adapted MARV (in mice), guinea pig- adapted 
MARV (in guinea pig), or wild- type MARV (in non-human primates [ NHPs ]) has shown 
reproducible evidence of efficacy . Statistically significant protection from mortality in 
experimental MVD mode ls was observed when dosing was begun up to 48 hours post-infection 
in the NHP ( Warren, Wells et al. 2014)  and guinea pigs, and up to 96 hours post-infection in 
mice. Experiments in hamsters infected with the Jimenez variant of rodent- adapted yellow fever 
virus provide additional nonclinical evidence of efficacy of IP administered galidesivir in hemorrhagic fevers (Julander, Bantia et al. 2014) .  
4.2.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
The PK of galidesivir administered by IV bolus, IM injection, or oral gavage have been evaluated in several studies in mice, rats, guinea pigs, and non-human primates (NHP). A 
summary of the PK of galidesivir  across species following IV bolus, IM injection, and oral 
administration can be found in the IB. 
In summary, when galidesivir is administered by IV bolus and IM injection routes, PK profiles 
are very similar and exposures ( maximum concentration [C
max] and  area under the concentration -
time curve [AUC]) are indistinguishable . After IV infusion over 30 min, C max is lower compared 
to after IV bolus or IM injection. The PK profile in plasma in all species examined is characterized by a rapid distribution phase followed by a slow terminal clearance phase; the 
volume of distribution is high, indicating extensive tissue uptake. Exposure is approximately linearly proportional to dose. 
14C-Galidesivir is rapidly distributed, with a tissue distribution 
profile in the rat that is not different for IV bolus and IM injection. The h ighest concentrations of 
administered radioactivity were seen in the liver. Mean dose-adjusted exposure to BCX6870 in liver was approximately 30 - to 200-fold higher than that of parent drug in plasma. Metabolism of 
galidesivir is insignificant with no metabolites over 2% of dose. Galidesivir is excreted in the urine in the rat and monkey. 
4.2.3. Nonclinical Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety and toxicological evaluation of galidesivir has been conducted in vitro and 
in vivo in both a rodent species (rat) and NHP species  (Cynolomolgus macaque) to support 
administration of IV infusions (and IM injections) to humans. Full details of these studies can be 
found in the IB.  
In vitro studies with galidesivir showed that galidesivir has a low concern for genotoxicity, is not 
toxic to mitochondrial function, did not inhibit human DNA polymerases, and has limited toxicity, compared with  other antiviral compounds, on the proliferation of myeloid, erythroid and 
megakaryocyte progenitors, suggesting a low potential for bone marrow toxicity. 
Secondary and safety pharmacology studies suggest that galidesivir has a low potential to lead to 
unwanted cellular toxicities or effects in key mammalian functions, such as respirat ory, central 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
25  nervous system (CNS), or electrocardiology. Increases in blood pressure ( BP) and heart rate 
were observed at IM doses greater than 10 mg/kg in nonclinical studies in conscious monkeys. In 
vitro, galidesivir is compatible with human blood and does not cause hemolysis at 15 mg/mL, the 
highest concentration tested. Animal safety studies performed to support the IV infusion route of administration have used galidesivir formulated in Lactated Ringer ’s (LR).  
Toxicity studies of galidesivir in the cynomolgus monkey and rat used the IV infusion (30  minutes) and IM administration routes. The systemic toxicologic profile for each route is 
similar. The primary target organs of toxicity in the rat were the kidney and liver, with toxicities also observed in the spleen, testes, thymus, heart, hematopoietic system, and IM injection sites. Target organs of toxicity in the monkey were kidney, liver, lymphoid system, and IM injection 
sites. Toxicities in both species were dose related. Microscopic changes in l iver and kidney were 
correlated to monitorable changes in relevant clinical chemistry analytes, and reversible.   
4.3. Clinical Findings  
One study is complete in human subjects with data available (BCX4430-101). A brief description of the study, as well as a ge neral summary of the safety and PK is described below; 
details can be found in the BCX4430-101 Clinical Study R eport (CSR) and the IB. 
4.3.1. Study BCX4430-101 
4.3.1.1. BCX4430-101: Study Design  
Study BCX4430-101 was a 3-part, Phase 1, dose- ranging study of galidesivir administered by 
IM injection. In all parts of the study, safety and tolerability were evaluated through assessments 
of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory analyses (clinical chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, electrocardi ograms (ECG; 12  lead and telemetry), 
echocardiograms (ECHOs), injection site assessments, and physical examinations  (Pes) . Subjects 
used a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 –100 mm) to measure injection site pain following IM 
injection(s). In addition, study pers onnel performed clinical assessments at injection sites for 
erythema, pain, swelling, and tenderness.   
For the evaluation of galidesivir plasma PK parameters, blood samples were collected at multiple 
time points during the study. Dose proportionality was evaluated (power model and analysis of 
variance [ANOVA]) following single (Part  1) and multiple (Part 3) ascending galidesivir doses. 
The effect of lidocaine on the PK of galidesivir  was evaluated (geometric least squares [GLS] 
mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals [CI]) in Part  2. Additionally, dose accumulation was 
evaluated (ANOVA) in Part  3.    
In Part  1, 6 ascending dose levels (0.3, 0.75, 1.8, 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) were administered  to 
separate cohorts of subjects in a double-blind, placebo- controlled fashion. Eight subjects 
received a single dose of study drug per cohort (6 subjects received galidesivir; 2  subjects 
received matching placebo). Subject dosing was staggered as a safety precaution.    
In parallel with Part 1 Cohort 6, 14 subjects in Part  2 completed a 2 -period crossover evaluation 
of the effect of lidocaine on IM injections of galidesivir. Subjects received 4.0 mg/kg  galidesivir 
with and without 20 mg lidocaine administered IM.  A summary of this part of the study, which 
is not rele vant to IV infusion administration, can be found in the IB. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
26  In Part  3, three ascending dose levels (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) were administered to separate 
cohorts of subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential manner. Ten subjects 
received a 7 -day course of study drug per dose cohort (8 subjects received galidesivir and 
2 subjects received placebo). Lidocaine was administered with all IM injections in Part 3.   
4.3.1.2. Study BCX4430- 101: Pharmacokinetic Results  
The plasma PK concentration -time profile of galidesivir at all doses was characterized by rapid 
absorption, an initial rapid distribution and clearance phase, and a slow terminal clearance phase. 
Time to maximum concentration (T max) after IM administration of galidesivir was typically 
15 minut es (the first PK sample was drawn at 5  minutes). PK results from Part 1 of the study are 
presented in Table 3 . Following single doses, galidesivir C max, AUC from time 0 to time “t” 
(AUC t), and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC inf) values increased in a slightly more than 
dose-proportional manner over the entire range of 0.3 –10.0 mg/kg. The inter -subject variability 
in exposure (C max and AUC) was low, as reflected in the geometric mean coefficients of 
variation (CVs) on these parameters.    
The geometric mean (CV%) cumulative fraction of the dose appearing unchanged in the urine over 48 hours after single doses ranged from 23.7% (42.2%) to 34.3% (16.5%).

with the power model and consistent with dose proportionality with the ANOVA model.  
Overall, there was an approximately 1.5 -fold increase in exposure (AUC) with repeat dosing 
over 7 days. Assessment of trough concentrations of galidesivir suggested that steady state had 
not been achieved by Day 7.

4.3.1.3. Study BCX4430-101: Safety and Tolerability  
Galidesivir  was ge nerally safe and well tolerated following single (0.3  to 10.0 mg/kg) and repeat 
(2.5 to 10.0 mg/kg) IM dosing in healthy subjects. No safety signals were detected. No subject 
experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) or a Grade 3 TEAE. No TEAE led to study  
discontinuation in Parts 1 or  2 of the study. Although study drug dosing was discontinued in 
1 subject (10.0 mg/kg galidesivir  + 20 mg lidocaine) on Day 4 of Part  3 after the subject 
experienced nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, the Investigator made the decision to discontinue the subject due to an intercurrent illness (injection anxiety).   
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
28  The primary TEAE reported by subjects randomized to galidesivir  was injection site pain; 
injection site pain was reported more often by subjects receiving galides ivir without lidocaine 
(Part  1: 13 subjects [36.1%] and Part 2: 10 subjects [66.7%]) vs. subjects receiving galidesivir  
with lidocaine (Part 2: 2 subjects [12.5%] and Part 3: 5 subjects [21.7%]). Investigator- assessed 
erythema, swelling, pain, and tenderness were infrequently reported, with little or no evidence of 
a dose relationship.   
A Grade  2 TEAE (injection site pain) definitely related to galidesivir  was reported by 6  subjects 
randomized to 4.0 mg/kg galidesivir  alone in Part  2. Two subjects experienced  Grade 2 TEAEs 
possibly related to galidesivir : liver enzyme elevation (ALT, Part  2: 4.0 mg/kg galidesivir  alone) 
and nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (Part 3: 10.0 mg/kg); the events resolved. As was 
expected with IM administration, Grade 2 and 3 treatment -emergent CK abnormalities were 
reported in all three parts of the study; however, these CK abnormalities were observed more often in subjects who received higher galidesivir  doses administered without lidocaine. Four 
subjects from Part  1, Cohort 4 experienced Grade 2 or 3 elevations in potassium. A safety 
evaluation of the potassium elevations found the elevations not to be associated with clinical evidence of hyperkalemia; there were no ECG changes at time points that coincided with the elevated results, and the subjects were clinically well with no TEAEs at these time points. It was 
determined that the elevated potassium values were likely due to pseudohyperkalemia.      
No clinically significant dose -related trends in laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, or ECHOs 
were noted.  
4.4. Rationale for Study  
Galidesivir is being developed as a parenterally administered nucleoside analog antiviral drug 
designed to inhibit the activity of a range of viruses associated with high morbidity or mortality, 
including MARV by disrupting formation of viral RNA by virally- encoded RNA-dependend 
RNA polymerase enzyme ( RdRp ). Galidesivir shows concentration-dependent inhibition of viral 
replication in mammalian cell lines in  vitro ( Warren, Wells et al. 2014) .   
Study BCX4430- 101, as described in Secti on 4.3.1, evaluated the exposure of galidesivir 
following single and multiple dose administration by IM injection. With the IM route of 
administration, in order to give doses over 10 mg/kg, subjects will have to be given more than 4 
injections per day.  The IV infusion route of administration will allow the administration of higher doses of galidesivir without numerous injections.  This is important because the target population for this drug are patients with bleeding tendencies due to viral hemorrhagic fever.   
This Phase 1 study will evaluate the exposure to galidesivir (plasma drug levels) achieved with a 
range of doses after administration by IV infusion over 60 minutes, will identify a safe dose 
range of galidesivir administered after a single dose, and will assist in evaluating the therapeutic 
window of galidesivir.  Additionally, this study will provide information about exposure of 
galidesivir for future studies with multiple dose administration .  
4.4.1. Study and Population  
Healthy subjects have been selected to minimize variability in factors that may affect the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of galidesivir. In MVD outbreaks, both sexes are affected; therefore, 
both men and women will be enrolled in the study.  It is considered imperative to characterize 
the safety and PK of galidesivir in women, including those of reproductive age, at this early stage 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
29  of development, and therefore considered acceptable to include women in this study, using the 
strict contraception requirements that are specified in Section  8.1. Both genders will be enrolled 
in the study. 
Reproductive toxicology studies have been conducted ( Section  Section  4.2.3).  Women of 
childbearing potential may be enrolled in this study if they meet the  contraceptive and pregnancy 
test requirements listed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
4.4.2. Rationale for R oute of Administration 
In nonclinical experiments, galidesivir  plasma exposures (AUC) after IM and IV bolus 
administration were very similar in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys, with 
concentration -time profiles that were nearly superimposable comparing the two routes across 
species. Additionally, exposure following IV and IM administration was largely dose 
proportional in nonclinical species. Although both IM and IV administrations are theoretically 
feasible routes of administration for galidesivir, based  on the effective dose in NHP models of 
filovirus diseases, the solubility profile of galidesivir requires that multiple daily  IM injections 
would be needed  for treatment of MVD and other vi ral hemorrhagic fevers .  The IV route of 
administration may be more useful for outbreak situations, because it will require fewer needle sticks than multiple IM injections , thus helping to reduce the risk of needle- stick transmission of 
filovirus infection to health care provide rs. Therefore, the IV route of administration is being 
explored in this study. 
4.4.3. Rationale for Study Doses 
The initial dose levels for galidesivir in this study were selected on the basis of the PK and safety 
data from Study BCX4430-101 together with target exposures effective in animal models of 
MVD. The PK of galidesivir was well characterized in Study BCX4430-101 after both single and multiple ascending doses; this enabled the dose select ion for this study to be made on the 
basis of simulated efficacious e xposures in models of MVD and other filovirus infections.  T he 
simulations of MVD model efficacious exposures w ere based on pharmacokinetic studies in 
cynomolgus macaques and corresponding effective doses in the same species in a model of 
MVD.  Simulations  of human exposure after IV infusion administration have suggested that 
exposure will be similar to the observed following the IM administration of galidesivir.  The 
5 mg/kg dose selected as the starting dose for this study is anticipated to have a C
max of 
approximately 3000 ng/mL and an AUC from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 24) of approximately 
10,000 ng.h/mL.  The proposed maximum dose for this study, a single dose of  20 mg/kg, is also 
supported by the nonclinical safety and TK data for IV administration in monkeys and rats, with a no adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) in monkeys of 30 mg/kg/day with an associated AUC
24 of 
52,500 ng.h/mL ; the expected human exposure at a 20 mg/kg dose is approximately 
47,000 ng.h/mL. 
All planned proposed doses for the study are in Section  7.1. The choice of higher doses to be 
studied may be modified depending on emerging PK results from the lower dose cohorts.   
4.5. Benefit-Risk Analysis  
Galidesivir is a parenterally available small molecule nucleoside analog inhibitor of viral RNA 
polymerase activity, mediated through non-obligate RNA chain termination. Nucleoside analogs 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
30  have a proven mode of action in the treatment of multiple human viral infections. As a class, 
some nucleoside analogs have been associated with serious adverse reactions, including 
peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, pancreatitis, and lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis, resulting from mitochondrial toxicity following chronic dosing (Lund, Peterson et al. 2007) . 
There is no evidence in the literature of acute severe adverse reactions resulting from treatment 
with nucleoside analogs following single doses or up to 1 week of dosing. 
• Toxicity studies in the cynomolgus monkey and rat have been conducted with IV infusion administration. Although C
max and AUC are lower following IV infusion 
compared with  IM injection, no new findings have been identified from IV infusion 
toxicology studies. Therefore, the IM studies provide useful toxicological information to develop appropriate monitoring in an IV study. 
• Toxicology studies in rats and monkeys summarized in the IB suggest that the primary target organs of galidesivir toxicity following IM administration in the rat 
were the kidney and liver, with toxicities also observed in the spleen, testes, thymus, 
heart, hematopoietic system, and injection sites. Target organs of systemic toxicity in the monkey were kidney, liver, lymphoid system, and injection sites. T he principal 
target organ of systemic toxicity in rats and monkeys following IV infusion was the 
kidneys ( Section  4.2.3). Microscopic changes in liver and kidney correlated to 
monitorable changes in relevant clinical chemistry analytes and were reversible. The 
large intestine was also a target in rats at the highest dose examined; minimal- to-mild 
single cell necrosis/degeneration in the cecum (with colon and rectum less frequently 
affected), with or without concurrent mucosa crypt epithelium 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy and/or mucosa inflammation. Galidesivir is compatible with 
human blood and does not cause hemolysis at concentration up to and including 15 mg/mL.    
• Clinical chemistry monitoring  will be conducted as part of the safety assessments  in 
this study  and will include neutrophil gelatinase- associated lipocal in (NGAL), a novel 
marker for tubular injury, and cystatin C, a biomarker of renal function. The lymphoid system is monitorable via routine blood counts. Testosterone levels will be monitored in male subjects.  Although the risk of cardiomyopathy is not cl ear from 
animal studies, this study will use laboratory ( creatine kinase MB fraction [ CK-MB], 
troponin I), ECG (both 12- lead and telemetry), and radiographic (ie,  ECHOs) 
methods to assess and monitor cardiac health.  
• Secondary and safety pharmacology studies summarized in the IB suggest that 
galidesivir has a low potential to lead to unwanted cellular toxicities or effects in key 
mammalian functions, such as respiratory, central nervous system, or electrocardiology. Increases in BP and heart rate were obser ved at IM doses 
> 10 mg/kg in nonclinical studies in conscious monkeys. Subjects with hypertension will be excluded from the study, and subjects who are enrolled will be monitored for vital signs in addition to the assessments of cardiac health mentioned above.   
Given the above considerations, there appears to be a relatively low risk of severe adverse reactions resulting from single dose administration of galidesivir. All  cohorts will rely upon the 
use of sentinel dosing (1 subject receives active drug and 1  subject receives placebo until the 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
31  acute safety profile of the investigational drug can be defined). Appropriate safety monitoring for 
observed nonclinical safety risks will be employed.   
4.5.1. Risks/Safety Signals Observed in the First -in-Human Intramuscular Injection 
Study with Galidesivir  
In Study BCX4430-101, healthy volunteers received IM injections of galidesivir, with 6 single 
ascending dose (SAD) cohorts ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, and 4 multiple ascending dose 
(MAD)  cohorts (2.5, 4.0 and 10 mg/kg once daily [ QD] x 7 days ). Subjects received one to four 
injections, depending on dose.  
• In the SAD cohorts, none of the nonclinical toxicology safety risks were confirmed as clinical safety signals.  
• The most common adverse events (AEs) were injection site pain (13/48 subjects [27.1%]), headache (8/48 [16.7%]), and presyncope (3/48 [6.3%]). No other AEs were reported in more than a single subject.  
• No significant laboratory abnormalities were noted, although there were several 
instances of pseudohyperkalemia. These elevated potassium levels were not confirmed upon retest and had no associated symptoms or ECG changes and were determined to be laboratory a rtifact.  
• There were no changes in cardiac enzymes, ECGs, or ECHOs.  
The second part of the study evaluated lidocaine co- administration with galidesivir IM 
injections.  
• In the lidocaine 4.0 mg/kg BCX4430 single dose cohort, none of the nonclinical toxicology safety risks were confirmed as clinical safety signals.  
In the MAD portion of the study, subjects received 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg of galidesivir along with 20 mg lidocaine in each injection intramuscularly for 7 days. Subjects received 1 to 4 injections  daily in order to deliver the complete dose. 
• In the MAD cohorts, none of the nonclinical toxicology safety risks were confirmed as clinical safety signals.  
• The most common AEs were injection site pain (5  subjects [17.2%]), injection site 
discomfort (2 [6.9%]), injection site reaction (2 [6.9%]), vessel puncture site bruise (2 [6.9%]), and headache (3 [10.3%]). No other AEs were reported in more than a 
single subject.  
• No significant laboratory abnormalities were noted other than CK elevations consistent w ith multiple IM injections. In a few subjects, the elevated CK was 
accompanied by mildly elevated CK -MB without any evidence of cardiac injury, and 
mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ), also consistent with IM injections. 
Also noted were subjects in all 3 MAD cohorts with activated partial thromboplastin 
time ( aPTT ) and prothrombin time abnormalities. In Cohort 3, 1 subject had Grade 3, 
6 subjects had Grade 2, and 1 subject had Grade 1 aPTT abnormalities. In 4 of 8 
subjects, the prothrombin time was also abnormal. In most cases there was no 
international normalized ratio
 abnormality and no subject had any clinical symptoms 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
32  or bleeding. These results were considered not clinically significant and the cause was 
considered to be laboratory artifact.   
Overall, no safety risks were identified during the Phase 1 study with galidesivir IM injection 
other than injection site pain, which will not be a concern during IV administration of galidesivir. 
Given the lack of any injection site changes , such as sig nificant erythema, edema, nodules, 
necrosis , after IM injection, extravasation of galidesivir infused IV is unlikely to cause injury; 
however, infusion sites will be closely monitored.  
4.5.2. Risks of Potential Adverse Events with Study -Mandated Procedures  
Blood will be drawn from study participants for safety and PK assessments, which imparts a 
small risk of venipuncture injury, infection, and hypotension. To reduce the risk of anemia, < 500 mL of blood will be drawn from any subject during the study (screening through last 
scheduled follow-up visit), and anemic subjects will not be allowed to enroll in the study or 
continue participation if they become anemic during the study. The total blood collected for this study for both PK and safety laboratory assessments will be approximately 300 mL.   
Venipuncture may cause transient discomfort and may result in fainting. Fainting is usually 
transient and managed by having the subject lie down and elevate his/her legs. Bruising at the site of the venipuncture may occur but may be prevented or lessened by applying pressure to the 
site for several minutes. Venipuncture may also cause infection. The use of aseptic (sterile) 
technique will make infection at the site where blood will be drawn extremely unlikely.  
4.5.3. Risks Associat ed with Infusions  
Galidesivir at a concentration of 100 mg/mL will be diluted to a maximum concentration of 
5 mg/mL using an LR solution.  IV doses of galidesivir will be infused over 60 minutes via an IV 
catheter at  a maximum rate of 8.33 mL/min. Nonclinic al local tolerability studies in the rabbit 
showed that intra- arterial injection of 30  mg/kg and perivascular injection of 7.5 mg/animal 
caused severe erythema with no microscopic correlate. In Study BCX4430-101, there were no 
injection site changes such as erythema, edema, nodules, necrosis, etc., after IM injection. Taken together, these findings indicate that it is unlikely that extravasation of galidesivir -infused IV 
would cause injury; however, infusion sites will be closely monitored.  
The pH of the diluted drug in LR that will be infused will be approximately 4.0  to 5.0 ( Alcami 
2016) , which should buffer to a physiologic pH rapidly, making peripheral veins appropriate for 
infusion. General risks associated with IV infusions include pain, bruising, phlebitis , thrombosis 
of the cannulated vein, and leaking IV fluid into the tissues near the injection. Careful inspection 
of the site, including visualization of blood return at the catheter site and an infusion time of 
60 minutes (ie , maximum rate of 8.33 mL/minute), will minimize this risk.  There is a risk of 
infection; however, this is a small risk as aseptic technique will be employed  to reduce this risk.  
4.5.4. Known Potential Benefits  
Apart from receiving a medical assessment during the screening proces s, there is no benefit to 
the subjects from taking part in this study. The development of galidesivir may be of benefit to 
the broader population as a potential therapeutic medical countermeasure for the treatment of MVD and other filovirus infections.

6.2. Secondary Endpoints  
• Plasma and  urine PK parameters for galidesivir  
• Dose proportionality of galidesivir 
7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This SAD study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of single doses of galidesivir vs. 
placebo administered as IV infusions in heal thy subjects  in up to four dose cohorts. A single dose 
of study drug will be administered to 8  subjects per cohort: 6 subjects will receive galidesivir IV, 
and 2 subjects will receive matching placebo.   
The planned cohorts are as follows: 
• Cohort 1, Regime n A: 5 mg/kg galidesivir or placebo, IV infusion × 1 dose 
• Cohort 2, Regimen B: 10 mg/kg galidesivir or placebo, IV infusion × 1 dose 
• Cohort 3, Regimen C: 15 mg/kg galidesivir or placebo, IV infusion × 1 dose 
• Cohort 4, Regimen D: 20 mg/kg galidesivir or placebo, IV infusion × 1 dose 
Study drug will be infused IV via a calibrated infusion pump over 60 minutes at  a maximum rate 
of 8.33 mL/min.  
As a safety precaution, on the first day of dosing in all cohorts, only 2 subjects will be dosed (to 
be referred to as sentinel subjects). The randomization schedule will be constructed such that 1 of 
the sentinel subjects dosed on the first day will be randomized to  receive galidesivir and 1 will be 
randomized to receive placebo. The remainder of  the cohort (5 subjects receiving galidesivir: 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
34  1 receiving placebo) will be dosed at least 2 days after the sentinels,  contingent upon satisfactory 
results from safety assessments of the sentinel subjects.  
Following a screening period to determine eligibility, subjects in each cohort will be admitted to 
the clinical research unit ( CRU ) on Day - 1. Study eligibility will be confirmed upon admission to 
the CRU , and subjects will remain in the CRU  overnight prior to dosing on Day 1. Following 
administration of the study drug on Day 1, subjects will remain in the CRU  for 96 hours to 
enable collection of PK samples and safety and tolerability data. Subjects will be discharged 
from the CRU  on Day 5, 96 hours after the start of the infusion. Subjects will return to the CRU  
for PK samples on Day 6 (+1 day), Day 8 (+1 day), and Day 14 (± 1 day). Subjects will return to 
the CRU  for a final follow -up visit on Day 21 (+ 2 days). The study design is shown in Figure 1 . 
In the event that there are any unresolved safety findings that are ongoing at Day 21, the subject will be followed at additional study visits until the findings are resolved or stabilized. If it is determined that the median half -life is longer than anticipated following IV infusion, or if after 
obtaining PK data through 96 hours, the AUC
inf estimate is >  25% of the AUC from time 0 to the 
last measurable concentration of drug (AUC last), seri al PK sampling may be extended beyond 
96 hours in subsequent cohorts, or additional samples may  be added in the intervening period 
between discharge from the CRU and the final follow-up visit (Day 21).   
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through ass essments of AEs, laboratory analyses 
(clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, CK- MB, troponin), vital signs, ECGs, 
ECHOs, cardiac telemetry, and PEs at the time points indicated in the schedule of assessments. PK parameters will be analyzed from the plasma and urine samples collected at the time points indicated in the schedule of assessments ( Table 5) .  
Enrollment of subjects in each sequential higher dose level cohort will occur only after completion of a clinical safety review of laboratory, AE, vital sign, ECG (12- lead and telemetry), 
and PE data for all subjects up through 96 hours post-dose and plasma PK data through 24 hours, 
by the Sponsor medical monitor,  clinical pharmacologist, and principal investigator (PI) at a dose 
escalation review meeting. Rules for halting the escalation to the next dose will be followed as 
defined in Section 7.6.3.2.   
Safety and PK data for each cohort will be submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) after each cohort is complete. Escalation to the next planned dose may proceed as long as the halting rules are not triggered as defined in Section 7.6.3.2.

a. Weight only.  
b. A physical examination consisting of the head and neck, skin, chest (lungs and heart), abdomen (gastrointestinal tract, liver , spleen and kidneys), back, 
musculoskeletal system, and neurologic system should be conduct ed at screening and  on Day 5 prior to discharge. Breast and genitourinary system do not 
require examination unless the potential subject indicates a complaint or comorbidity that could result in exclusion.  All other  physical exams will be 
symptom directed . The site of infusion should be checked for any changes in skin.   
c. Three (3) serial ECGs will be performed at screening and baseline 1 –3 minutes apart. Pre- dose ECG should be collected within ≤  2 hours of the first dose.  
d. 12-lead ECGs will be conducted on Day 1 at 2 and 4 hours post  dose (post start of the infusion)  and on Day 2 at 24 hours post  dose (post start of the 
infusion) . An acceptable window is ± 10 minutes from the nominal time point. All subsequent ECGs are daily.  
e. Cardiac telemetry will be initi ated ≥  2 hours prior to administration of the dose  and will continue for 24 hours after the infusion is started . Subjects may be 
disconnected for bathroom, hygiene needs, and for 20- minute periods 3 times a day for meals. In addition, subjects may be disconnected for 10  minutes 
every 2 hours while awake for mild physical exercise such as walking or calf exercises.  
f. The ECHO may be performed at any time from screening to Day -2 for eligibility determination. An ECHO should also be performed on Day 4.  An 
acceptable window for the Day 4 ECHO is up until Day 5 discharge. 
g. Vital signs (except  temperature) will be obtained pre -dose (within 2 hours of dosing)  1, 2, 4, and 8 hours post  dose (post start of the infusion) on Day 1, at 
24 hours post  dose on Day 2 and onc e per day where indicated. Oral temperature will be obtained at 8 hours post  dose on Day 1 and at 24 hours post  dose 
on Day 2. Subjects should be rested for 10 minutes in the supine position prior to vital sign measurements.   All times are from the start of the infusion.

 39  7.2. Number of Subjects  
It is planned that 32 subjects will be enrolled in the study, with 8 subjects enrolled per cohort. In 
each cohort, 6 subjects will receive galidesivir and 2 subjects will receive placebo.   
Subjects may be replaced as noted in Section  8.5. 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Following confirmation of eligibility, subjects will be identified by a unique 5 -digit subject 
identifier (eg, 11001) in which the first digit indicates the study site identifier, the second digit 
indicates the cohort number and the final 3 digits indicate the subject number. Any replacement 
subjects will be identified by replacing the third digit “0” with “9”. For example, if Subject  11005 withdraws from the study early, the replacement subject will be numbered 11905 
and will receive the same  study treatment (ie, active or placebo) as Subject 11005. 
Subject numbers will be as follows:  
Cohort Subject Numbers  Replacement Subject Numbers  
1 11001 to 11008 11901 to 11908 
2 12001 to 12008 12901 to 12908 
3 13001 to 13008 13901 to 13908 
4 14001 to 14008 14901 to 14908 
7.4. Randomization Procedures  
The randomization schedules will be generated by an unblinded study statistician. Masking procedures will be as outlined in Sections  7.5 and 9.6 and will be used to blind study drug.   
A computer-generated randomization schedule will be used to randomly assign subjects to galidesivir or placebo. Subjects in each of the Cohorts 1 to 4 will be randomized to galides ivir or 
placebo in a 3:1 ratio ( ie, 6 subjects per cohort will be randomly assigned to receive galidesivir 
and 2 subjects per cohort will be randomly assigned to receive placebo). 
As a safety precaution, on the first day of dosing in all cohorts, 2 sentinel subjects will be 
initially dosed. The randomization schedule will be generated so that in each cohort 1 sentinel 
subject is randomly assigned to receive galidesivir and 1 is randomly assigned to receive 
placebo. Contingent upon satisfactory results as determined by the PI from safety assessments 24 hours post-dosing (e.g., AEs, ECGs, etc.  as described in Section 7.6) of the sentinel subjects, 
the remain der of the cohort may be dosed at least 2 days later (with 5  subjects randomly assigned 
to receive galidesivir and 1  subject randomly assigned to receive placebo). 
7.5. Masking Procedures  
This is a double-blind study; treatment assignment within a cohort will be blinded to the PI, clinical staff, study subjects, and the data management team, with the exception of the unblinded 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 40  dosing team, if required. As described in Sectio n 9.6, once infusion bags are prepared and 
labeled, the research pharmacist will mask the IV bag and tubing (ie, with the use of an overlay 
or mask ing tape) to blind the color of the solution in the IV bag and in the IV line . 
An unblinded dosing team may be utilized in this study if required.  Members of the unblinded 
dosing team will not be involved in any assessments on the study and will only be utilized for 
dose administration.    
The PI or designee(s) will confirm subject eligibility. The unblinded pharmacist at the clinical 
site will re ceive a copy of the final randomization schedule from the unblinded statistician for 
preparation of the study drug. The laboratory performing bioanalytical analysis will also be 
provided this randomization scheme. The clinical pharmacologist will receive a  copy of the 
randomization scheme to prepare interim PK summaries for dose escalation review meetings. The unblinded clinical pharmacologist will attend all dose escalation review meetings.  
Prior to database lock and unblinding, all original randomization materials will be held by 
quality assurance personnel and blinded staff will not have access to the randomization schedule 
during this time. Disclosure envelopes are held in a locked cabinet in the clinical unit and will be used in the event of an emergenc y by the PI.  
Access to study drug assignment will be immediately available if the PI deems it necessary to break the study blind in the interest of a subject’s medical safety, in case of a medical emergency, to meet regulatory safety reporting obligations, or if warranted during scheduled 
safety reviews. The PI must contact the medical monitor within 24 hours following disclosure of 
study drug assignment.  
Any request for information on the randomization schedule after initial issue must be made using 
a randomization disclosure form, except in the case of emergency unblinding, which must be 
recorded on the emergency unblinding form. Details of any disclosure of the randomization schedule will be documented and filed appropriately.  
Breaking the blind for a single subject (or the 2 sentinel subjects) will not affect the blind for the 
remaining subjects; however, the site must appropriately document the process. Data may be unblinded, if required, for an interim review of PK and safety data. 
7.6. Dose Escalation an d Continuation Criteria  
7.6.1. Criteria for Continuing to Dose Within a Cohort after Sentinel Subjects Have 
Been Dosed  
In each cohort,  2 sentinel subjects will be dosed initially. The randomization schedule will be 
constructed such that 1 of the sentinel subjects  dosed on the first day will be randomized to 
receive galidesivir and 1  will be randomized to receive placebo. After review of the safety data 
from the 24-hour post-dose period for the sentinel subjects, which includes review of any AEs, 
any abnormalities in the bedside ECGs, safety laboratory assessments  and vital signs, the 
remainder of the cohort (5  subjects randomized to galidesivir; 1  randomized to placebo) will be 
dosed at least 2 days after the sentinel subjects .   
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 41  7.6.2. Dose Escalation Criteria  
As described in Section 11.5.2, at the completion of each cohort, the Dose Escalation C ommittee  
(DEC) will meet to review the safety and PK data fro m the cohort. Dose escalation to the 
subsequent cohort may proceed without consult with the S afety Monitoring C ommittee (SMC) as 
long as none of the following criteria are met:  
• One or more subjects with a treatment -emergent QT interval corrected by Frideri cia's 
formula (QTcF) > 480 ms (Grade 2 per the National Institutes of Health [NIH] 
Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [ DMID ] scale) as determined from 
bedside ECGs (with repeat ECG) . If this occurs, the SMC may consult with an 
independent cardiologist as needed.  If it is deemed acceptable to restart the study 
following review of the data and discussion with an independent cardiologist , if 
needed, dosing may resume.  
• One or more subjects experiences an increase in BP that requires acute treatment, or 
has a confirmed systolic BP > 160 mmHg, or a confirmed diastolic BP >  100 mmHg  
(Grade 3 per DMID scale). Confirmed BP changes require at least 2 measurements at least 2 hours apart, each measured after at least 5 minutes of supine rest.  
• Anaph ylactic reaction occurs  in 1 subject . 
• One or more subjects experience a similar Grade 3 treatment -emergent laboratory 
abnormality or AE that is suspected to be drug- related as determined by the 
Investigator. 
• One subject experiences an SAE.  
• A cohort’s m edian AUC
24 is ≥ 52,500 ng.h/mL, equivalent to the NOAEL exposure 
in cynomolgus monkeys.   
If one of the above safety criteria are met, the SMC will be called to review the safety data from the study. The SMC may make one of two recommendations: to halt the st udy for further review, 
or to modify the planned dose escalation to the next dose level. Additionally, the dose escalation 
may be modified based on review of emerging PK data from any cohort, if needed, in order to 
refine the escalation to achieve exposure that will not e xceed the NOAEL. This review of data 
may include modeling of planned doses to predict exposure from subsequent cohorts.   
7.6.3. Study Drug and Study Halting Rules  
7.6.3.1. Infusion Halting Rules  
For any individual subject, an infusion must be stopped for the following non- drug related 
events: the IV line is lost, there is extravasation, or the IV pump malfunctions such that the dose 
cannot be given in a controlled manner.  A 10 -minute window is allowed for the infusion, in 
order to allow for infusion issues to be resolved.   
For any individual subject, the infusion must be stopped for any suspected drug- related event 
such as hypersensitivity (Grade 1 or higher) during infusion.  For any individual subject, the infusion must be stopped for any suspected severe (Grade 3) or 
serious adverse event during infusion. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 42  The reason for subject discontinuation from the infusion will be recorded in the source 
documents and electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). In all cases, subjects who discontinue study 
drug should remain in the study and have all protocol defined study safety assessments 
performed.  
7.6.3.2. Study Halting Rules  
Further dosing of other subject s in any cohort will be halted if any of the following criteria are 
met cumulatively  across cohorts ; dosing may not recommence unless recommended by the study 
SMC  during the SMC review process: 
• The death of a dosed subject for any reason. 
• One galidesivir -treated subject experiences an SAE that is considered to be at least 
possibly related to study drug.   
• Two or more subjects experience a Grade 3 AE in the same organ class (systemic 
toxicity, confirmed clinical laboratory tests, or vital signs) regardless of relatedness to 
study drug. 
• An anaphylactic reaction occur s in 2 subject s. 
• One or more subjects experience a confirmed Grade 3  QTcF ( QTcF  > 500 ms or 
QTcF increase > 60 ms ), or two or more subjects cumulatively have experienced a 
Grade 2 change in QTcF (>480 msec) . If following discussion with an independent 
cardiologist, it is deemed acceptable to restart the study, dosing will resume. All 
relevant data will be submitted to the regulatory authorities and Institutional R eview 
Board (IRB).   
• Two or more subjects experiences an increase in BP which requires acute treatment, or has a confirmed systolic BP > 160 mmHg, or a confirmed diastolic BP 
> 100 mmHg. Confirmed BP changes require at least two  measurements at least 
2 hours apart, each measured after at least 5 minutes of supine rest.  
If, following revie w by the SMC ( Section  11.5.3) it is deeme d acceptable to restart the study, all 
relevant data will be submitted to the  regulatory authorities and the IRB.  
7.7. Criteria for Study Termination  
BioCryst reserves the right to terminate the study prior to inclusion of the intended number of 
subjects but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reas ons. Valid 
scientific reasons may include the development of unacceptable safety or PK findings that do not 
support continuation of the study. After such a decision, the PI must contact all ongoing subjects immediately after notification. As directed by BioCryst, all study materials must be collected and 
all (eCRFs completed to the greatest extent possible. Subjects enrolled at the time of study 
termination would continue to undergo all scheduled assessments as defined in Section  10.   
After the start of protocol activities but prior to the commencement of dosing, the study may be 
terminated by the Sponsor or PI without consultation with the FDA and IRB. Notification of early termination should be provided to the FDA and IRB within 15 days, clearly explaining the reasons for the termination. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 43  If the study is abandoned prior to commencement of any protocol ac tivities, the PI or Sponsor 
must notify the FDA and IRB by letter outlining the reasons for abandonment of the study. 
Once dosing has begun, the study will be completed as planned unless the following criteria are 
satisfied that require early termination o f the study: 
• Study halting rules are met and continuing the study would pose an unreasonable risk 
to subject safety.  
• New information regarding the safety of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) that indicates an unreasonable risk for subjects partic ipating in the study.  
• Significant violation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to achieve the primary study objectives or compromises subject safety.  
If it becomes necessary to consider termination of the study after dosing has begun, dosing may 
be suspended pending discussion between the Sponsor and PI. Dosing may be suspended immediately on safety grounds. 
The study may be terminated or suspended at the request of the FDA, SMC, National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), or IRB.

Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 47  juice, cranberry  or cranberry juice, caffeine or other xanthine-containing foods and 
beverages from Day - 1 until disch arge from the CRU  on Day 5, 96 hours post dose. 
• Subjects should refrain from eating food containing poppy seeds for 2 days prior to 
Day -1 admission until discharge from the CRU on Day 5, 96 hours post dose.  
• Subjects will abstain from alcohol consumption for 2 days prior to Day -1 admission 
through the follow-up visit on Day 21. 
• Subjects will be asked to avoid strenuous exercise from 7 days prior to Day 1 through 
the last follow -up visit on Day 21.  
Protocol restrictions should be reviewed at screening and Day -1 admission  to the CRU. 
8.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
8.4.1. Withdrawal from Study Drug  and Study  
Reasons for study drug withdrawal (ie, halting of the infusion) are described in Section 7.6.3.1.   
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study 
at any time , including during the infusion, and for any reason. A subject’s participation in the 
study will be terminated only for the following reasons: 
• Subject request to discontinue his or her participation in the study for any reason  
• Subject noncompliance, such as a significant protocol deviation 
• Discontinuation at the request of the Sponsor, regulatory authority, or IRB 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study who received any amount of the study product will be encouraged to continue follow-up (with subjects’ consent) for safety.   Subjects who withdraw will be asked to complete a final termination visit if they do not wish to be 
followed per protocol. 
8.5. Replacement of Subjects  
Replacement subjects may be enrolled as needed for the study to obtain the required number of evaluable subjects. An evaluable subject is defined as a subject who has sufficient PK samples collected to determine PK parameters through 24 hours post-dose and has sufficient safety data 
(including ECGs, ECHOs , vital signs, PE findings, and clinical lab data) through 24 hours post-
dose to allow for the evaluation of the primary objective.  At least 5 evaluable subjects who 
received galidesivir  are required per cohort. Replacement subjects will be allowed if PK 
parameters (through 24 hours post-dose) cannot be determined due to a subject’s early discontinuation from the study drug or study.   
Subjects who have an IV infusion stopped for non- drug related issues, as described in 
Section  7.6.3.1, will not continue with dosing but will have all scheduled safety assessments 
made.  These subjects may be replaced as needed. Subjects who have an IV infusion stopped for 
a safety related issued will not continue with dosing and will be followed as per Section  8.4.1. 
These subjects may be  replaced  if needed to fulfill  the required number of evaluable subjects.    
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 48  Subjects who withdraw due to a galidesivir -related AE will not be replaced. Subjects who 
withdraw for other reasons may be replaced at the discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor to 
ensure a sufficient number of evaluable subjects at the end of the clinical study.  
Following the infusion, one subject per cohort may withdraw prior to the completion of Day 5 
without being replaced.  Should more than 1 subject from the same cohort who did not meet the 
above criteria voluntarily withdraw from the study, those subjects ma y be replaced.  
In the event that a replacement subject withdraws, the subject will not be replaced.   
9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Treatments Administered  
Subjects will be administered  a single dose of study drug or placebo per dose cohort as shown 
below:

a Based on inclusion criterion No.  4 in Section  8.1, subjects must weigh ≥ 50 kg (110 lb.) and ≤ 100 kg (220 lb.). 
b  Maximum concentration is 4 mg/mL. The lowest concentration of drug used in this study will be 1.0 mg/mL. Rate 
of infusion and  volume infused will be adjusted as required for different concentrations, but the total length of the 
infusion will remain 60 minutes. Details on calculating infusion volume will be provided in a separate Pharmacy  
Manual.  
 Based on PK and safety data emer ging from the cohorts, subsequent cohort doses may be 
modified. Modifications to the planned dose escalation schema may be 
implemented  without 
modification of the protocol according to  the halting/cohort modification rules described in 
Section  7.6.3. If more than 4 cohorts are required  for the SAD, a protocol amendment will be 
implemented to enable enrollment of further cohorts 
9.2. Description of Investigational Medicinal Product  
Galidesivir for IV infusion is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution with a concentration of 100 mg per 
1 mL (100 mg/mL) and a  pH adjusted to 3.0. The 100 mg/mL solution may appear clear to 
colorless to brownish. Excipients inc lude Sterile Water for Injection USP/EP, Hydrochloric Acid 
NF/EP or Sodium Hydroxide NF/EP may be used for pH adjustment. Galidesivir for IV infusion is supplied by BioCryst  in 2 mL single- use amber glass vials fitted with rubber stoppers and 
aluminum flip -off seals. Each 2 -mL vial contains a fill volume of 1.2 mL.   
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 49  The study drug, including IV lines will be masked, as described in Section  7.5 in order to 
maintain the study blind.  Additional details can be found in the study- specific Pharmacy 
Manual.  
Stability of diluted concentrations of galidesivir in 250 mL injection bags has been established 
for concentrations between 1 and 15 mg/mL. The IV  solution is stored at room temperature 
(15˚C to 25˚C ) for up to 24 hours as described in Section 9.5.  The pH of the galidesivir solution 
in LR is  between 4 .0 and 5 .0 (Alcami 2016) .   
Additional details for the chemical and physical characteristics of galidesivir may be found in the 
IB. 
9.3. Description of Placebo  
LR Solution for Injection, USP will be used as the placebo. The volume for infusion should match the volume used in the active treatment in the respective cohort. 
LR solution will be provided by PRA Health Sciences .   
9.4. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
Study drug will be labeled with the following information: 
• Sponsor name and contact information 
• Study protocol number and name of PI 
• Lot number 
• Description of the contents of the container 
• Route of administration  
• Conditions for storage 
• Statement regarding the investigational (clinical study) use of the drug , which will 
state “Caution: New Drug – Limited by Federal (United States) law to investigational 
use.”  
9.5. Study Drug Storage  
Galidesivir vials (100 mg/mL) are  stored at 15˚C  to 25˚C (59˚F  to 77˚F).  
Galides ivir in LR solution is stored at 15˚C  to 25˚C (59˚F  to 77˚F) for up to 24 hours. 
LR solution (placebo) must be stored as per package insert (room temperature [25˚C]). Avoid 
excessive heat. Protect from freezing.  
Study drug will be reconciled and destroyed (or returned) in accordance with the study 
monitoring plan. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 50  9.6. Study Drug Preparation  
Study drug preparation will be performed  by a research pharmacist on the same day of study 
drug administration and must be prepared in a sterile environment (eg, biological safety cabinet 
or laminar flow hood) using aseptic technique.   
Prior to opening the study drug vial, it should be gently mixed by inverting several times and 
inspected under a bright light to ensure there are no particulates in the vial. Using aseptic 
technique, an appropriately sized sterile needle and syringe must be used to draw the appropriate 
dose and volume of galidesivir  or placebo. The syringe must not any individual vial more than 
once. The appropriate dose and volume of galidesivir or placebo will be added to the appropriate amount of LR solution in an infusion bag.    
To maintain blinding, once prepared and labeled, the research pharmacist will mask the IV bag 
and tubing (ie, with the use of an overlay or masking tape) to blind the color of the solution in 
the IV bag. In addition, the calculated volume for the placebo must match the corresponding calculated volume for the active drug. Additional details can be found in the study- specific 
Pharmacy Manual.   
9.7. Administration  
Galidesivir or placebo in LR solution will be administered IV via a peripheral venous catheter inserted into the arm of the subject. Study drug will be infused over 60 minutes via programmable infusion pump. The maximum rate expected for infusion is 8.33 mL/min. The catheter will  be maintained and replaced as per institutional policies at the CRU.  
An unblinded dosing team may be utilized in this study if required in order to prevent any inadvertent unblinding of study drug while connecting the masked IV bags with the infusion 
pumps (eg, any drips of the dosing solution during connection of the bag to the infusion pump or 
a temporary need to remove part of the masking tape or overlay on the IV tubing to make the connection).  Members of the unblinded dosing team will not be involved in any assessments on 
the study and will only be utilized for dose administration.  The unblinded dosing team should 
ensure that the study drug product is blinded to the subject and rest of the study personnel.   
In the event that an infusion must be stopped in the middle of dosing for a subject, the subject 
will not contribute to the PK population, and will be removed from further dosing but will 
continue to be followed for safety assessments per protocol ( Section  7.6.3). If the infusion is 
stopped for a non-drug related issue such as pump fail ure, asymptomatic extravasation , then the 
subject may be replaced as needed.  
A physician must be present at the time of study drug administration and present in the unit for a minimum of  4 hours after completion of the infusion.  
9.8. Treatment Compliance  
IV infusions of galidesivir or matching placebo in LR solution will be administered by the PI or qualified designee licensed to administer study medications. Compliance will be directly observed by study staff. Details of doses administered and dosing times will be recorded by 
study staff in the subject’s source documentation/eCRF. Any episodes of incomplete study drug 
administration will be recorded.  
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 51  9.9. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator must maintain accurate records of the disposition of all study drugs received 
from the Sponsor, and directly administered to the subjec t on a drug accountability form 
(including date and time). The site PI may delegate to the site research pharmacist the 
responsibility for study product accountability. The site research pharmacist will be responsible 
for maintaining complete records and documentation of product receipt, accountability, 
dispensation, temperature and storage conditions, and final disposition of study product. Each investigational product will have a separate drug accountability form. At the end of the study, 
information describing study drug supplies (eg, lot numbers) and disposition of supplies must be 
provided, signed by the Investigator or designee, and collected by the study monitor.  
9.10. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
At the end of the study, all medication that was not administered and used packaging materials will be returned to the Sponsor or destroyed on site as instructed by the Sponsor following IMP 
accountability by the study monitor and abiding by appropriate Standard Operating Procedure at 
the participating institu tion. 
9.11. Concomitant Medications  
Any medications used will be recorded in the source document and eCRF.  
Emergency equipment and drugs will be available within the CRU  as per current standard 
procedures. In the unlikely event that they are required, their use will be documented. 
9.12. Prohibited Medications  
Use of the following medications is prohibited 30 days prior to dosing through the Day 21 
follow-up visit: 
• Medications that are clinically known to induce or inhibit metabolic enzymes or transporters according to  the FDA Drug Interaction Guidance ( DHHS 2017 ).   
− A list of metabolic and transporter inducers and inhibitors can be found at: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm   
• Medications that are clinically known or suspected to prolong the QT interval 
− Medications falling into the category of drugs with a risk of torsades de pointes 
and drugs with a possible risk of torsades de pointes are listed at:  https://crediblemeds.org/  
Both lists will be provided to the study site by the Sponsor. 
In addition, use of investigational agents is prohibited within 90 days of screening through the follow-up visit. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 52  9.13. Food and Drink  
Following check -in procedures on Day -1, subjects will be provided with appropriate meals and 
will fast from all food for approximately 8 hours overnight prior to the morning of Day 1 , when 
subjects will receive a standardized ligh t breakfast 1 hour prior to dosing (standardized means 
the same breakfast will be administered to all subjects in all cohorts). Water or another beverage 
will be allowed during the meal prior to dosing.  Approximately 4 hours after dosing, a 
standardized lunch will be served. Dinner should be served approximately 9 hours after the start of dosing. Meals and snacks following dinner on Day 1 may be administered per routine clinic practice.  
Water will be pro vided ad libitum up to 2 hours prior to and 2 hours post the start of dos ing. 
10. STUDY CONDUCT  
10.1. Schedule of Assessments  
The schedule of assessments in this study is  summarized in Table 5 and described in more detail 
in Section 11.   
Screening procedures are presented in Section 10.1.1.  Study procedures are pres ented in Section  
Section  10.1.2 .  Follow-up procedures conducted on Day 21 will be the same as any early 
termination visit procedures and are presen ted together in Section 10.1.3. 
10.1.1. Screening  
Prospective subjects should be screened within 28 days prior to Day 1. Written informed consent 
must be obtained from each subject before initiation of any screening assessments or procedures. Each subject will receive a copy of the signed and dated study -specific Informed Consent F orm 
(ICF). Prospective subjects who have signed an ICF and who are interested in participation in the study will then undergo assessments at a screening visit to determine eligibility.  
The Investigator (or designee) will conduct the following assessments at the screening visit: 
• Review inclusion and exclusion criteria for study eligibility  
• Collect demographic data  
• Review medical and medication history  
• Height, weight, and BMI  
• Drug screen, urine alcohol  and urine cotinine test 
• Blood collection for s creening  labs ( see Table 6 for list of labs ), HBV /HIV/HCV 
serology, FSH (for women who declare that they have been post- menopausal ≤ 2 years)  
• Serum pregnancy test for all women   
• Urinalysis  
• Determine urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR)  
• Vital signs (heart rate, BP,  temperature)  
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 53  • Physical examination  including vein assessment 
• 12-lead ECG  
• ECHO (Note: ECHO may be performed at any time from screening to Day -2.  The 
ECHO should be done after a subject is otherwise deemed eligible for the study.  The 
ECHO is required to determine eligibility, so it must be c onducted prior to Day - 1 CRU 
check -in).   
For height and weight measurements, subjects will be allowed to wear indoor clothing, without shoes.  
Demographic data will include date of birth, sex, race and  ethnicity.  
All screening data must be obtained within  28 days prior to administration of study medication, 
as stipulated above. Rescreening of ineligible subjects, where there is a reasonable expectation that the subject will 
become eligible, will be approved or denied on a case- by-case basis by the Investig ator. In the 
case of rescreening, the Investigator may request all or a subset of the required assessments to be 
redone. Subjects may only be rescreened once and all assessments must be performed/drawn within the required screening window.  If a subject is rescreened, the subject must be re-
consented.   
If a subject has completed all assessments for screening including the ECHO, but are not dosed 
as part of the cohort (ie, they are a backup subject), the subject may be eligible for a subsequent 
cohort.  For any subsequent cohort that the subject screens for, the subject must complete all screening assessments within the appropriate 28 -day window, with the exception of the ECHO, 
which does not need to be repeated.  The ECHO from the original screening may be utilized for eligibility purposes.  However if a subject failed screening based on the ECHO, they are not eligible to repeat screening in a later cohort in the hopes they will have a suitable ECHO.   
10.1.2. Study Procedures  
Subjects will check into the clinic on Day -1 and will remain in the clinic until discharge on 
Day 5, 96 hours post dose. Subjects will return to the clinic for brief (1  to 2 h duration) visits for 
PK sampling on Day 6, 8 and 14 and for a final follow-up visit on Day 21.   
Subject identity  will be confirmed at check -in.   
Upon check-in on Day-1, subjects will have the following procedures conducted as outlined in Table 5: 
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria and prohibited medications 
• Medical and medication history   
• Weight

Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 55  • Review of A Es and concomitant medications. If any reported AEs require additional 
assessments ( PE, vital signs, laboratory tests), the required assessments to evaluate the 
AE should be compl eted at these visits.  
10.1.3. Follow- up/Early Termination Visit  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 21 +2 for a follow- up visit.  If a subject terminates from 
the study at any point prior to the scheduled follow-up visit, the assessments listed below should 
be performed  at that time .   
The following procedures will be performed at the follow-up visit:

11. ASSESSMENTS 
11.1. Investigator -Completed Assessments  
Demographic information, including year of birth, sex, race or ethnicity, and medical and 
medication history will be captured for each subject participating in the study at the Screening 
visit. Medical history, medication review, and review of inclusion and exclusion criteria and prohibited medications will also be rechecked as outlined in Table 5.  
There are times where the protocol requires more than one procedure to be completed at the 
same time point. In these instances, the following will apply to post dose time points:  
• PK samples will take precedence over other procedures and will therefore be collected at 
the nominal time. An exception to this is the collection of chemistry lab samples which should be collected in the order listed in Section 11.3.1.7. 
• Vital signs will be recorded after the nominal time  
• ECG recordings will be taken prior to the nominal time (prior to the PK sample) 
The Investigator, or a qualified designee, should complete the assessments listed in the protocol. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 56  11.2. Pharmacokin etic Assessments  
11.2.1. Blood Sample Collection  
Twenty -three  blood samples for the measurement of plasma concentrations of galidesivir will be 
collected at the following time points:  
• Pre-dose, halfway through the infusion (30 minutes), 1 hour (end of the infusion) 1.25, 
1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours post dose. 
• Day 6 (+1 day), Day 8 (+1 day), Day 14 (± 1 day) 
• Day 21 (+ 2 days) or early termination  
Subjects will have a cannula placed for administration of the infusion in one arm, and blood 
samples for PK will be collected from the other arm, either through direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula. All cannulas placed will be maintained according to the policies of the unit while in use .  All samples are timed from the start of the infusion. 
The PK sample collection time points may be modified based on the concentration -time course 
found in the early cohorts. For subjects randomized to placebo, only the 5-minute post-infusion 
sample will be analyzed. The pre-dose PK sample must be collected within ≤ 1 hour of the dose. 
Within the first 2 hours post-dose, an acceptable window around each PK draw is ± 2 minutes. 
After 2 hours, an acceptable window is ± 10 minutes while the subject is in the unit. For the 
samples collected when the subjects return to the CRU post-discharge, the appropriate window is 
as noted above. 
11.2.2. Urine Sample Collection  
For the analysis of galidesivir, an aliquot of urine will be collected pre-dose (0 hour) and all 
urine will be collected for the following po st-dose intervals: 0–12, 12–24, 24–48, 48–72, and 72–
96 hours. A window of ± 30 minutes at t he end of each interval is acceptable. For timing of the 
intervals, time 0 starts at the time of dosing.  For the pre-dose sample collection, the urine sample 
should be collected within 2 hours prior to dosing.   
The total volume of all urine collected during each time interval will be recorded in the source 
documentation/eCRF. For subjects who are randomized to placebo, no urine will be analyzed for galidesivir concentrations. 
11.2.3. Sample Analysis 
All plasma and urine determination of galidesivir will be analyzed using a validated liquid 
chromatography -tandem mass spectroscopy assay. Instructions for co llection, processing, 
storage, and shipment of PK samples will be provided to the clinical site in a separate Clinical Sample Processing Manual.  
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 57  11.3. Assessment of Safety  
11.3.1. Safety Parameters  
11.3.1.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs include measurements of heart rate, BP, and temperature. BP (systolic and diastolic), 
pulse rate, and temperature should be taken after the subject has rested in the supine position for 
at least 10 minutes. Respiratory rate is a required vital sign at Screening for eligibility  and should 
be taken after the subject has rested in the supine position for at least 10 minutes.  BP 
measurements must be obtained with an appropriate cuff size and with the subject’s arm 
supported at the level of the heart. It is acceptable to obtain a pulse rate from the BP or EC G 
machine. Grade 2 or higher vitals will be repeated in 30 minutes if abnormal. 
Pre-dose vital signs must be collected within 2 hours of the IV infusion. Post dose vital signs 
may be obtained within 10 minutes of the nominal time  point. Any abnormality should be graded 
on a scale from 0  (none) to 3 (severe) using the modified 2014 DMID Adult Toxicity Grading 
Scale; APPENDIX A ) and  reported as an AE if appropriate as per Section 11.4.1.1. If the event 
is more severe than a Grade 3, severity criteria as described in  Section 11.4.1.2 should be used to 
characterize the event.  
11.3.1.2. Weight/Height/Body Mass Index 
For determination of height and weight, subjects should be dressed, without shoes. BMI should 
be calculated using the following formula: 
 BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)2 
Weight/BMI will be collected at screening for eligibility determination. Weight will be collected 
on Day -1 in order to complete the dosing calculations.   
11.3.1.3. Physical Examination 
A PE  consisting of the head and neck, skin, chest (lungs and heart), abdomen (gastrointestinal 
tract, liver, spleen and kidneys), back, musculo-skeletal system, neurologic system should be 
conducted at screening and at discharge from the unit. Breast and genitourinary system do not require examination unless the potential subject indicates a complaint or comorbidity that could result in exclusion. 
All subsequent PEs  may be symptom driven based on the subject’s interim  medical history . 
11.3.1.4. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A standard bedside 12- lead ECG machine that calculates heart rate and meas ures the PR, QRS, 
QT, RR, and QTc (QTcF) intervals will be utilized. Prior to obtaining an ECG, subjects must rest 
quietly in a supine position for at least 10 minutes. 
Qualified site personnel should review the ECGs and automated findings from the Day 1 pre -
dose and post dose ECGs prior to the next day’s dosing or scheduled assessments for gross 
abnormalities and interval measurements of concern (absolute readings and for post dose ECGs, 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 58  change from baseline). For all ECGs, the clinical interpretation of the ECG should be recorded 
directly on a hard copy of the ECGs. Copies of the ECGs may be requested by the Sponsor. 
Screening and baseline (Day 1 pre -dose) ECGs will be obtained in triplicate at 1 - to 5- minute 
intervals, with baseline values calculated from an average of the three readings. The pre-dose 
ECG should be collected within ≤ 2 hours of the first dose. Thereafter, single assessment ECG will be  performed on Day 1 at 2 and 4 hours post dose, Day 2 at 24 hours post-dose and on Days 
3 and 4 while the subject is in the CRU . An acceptable window is ±  10 minutes from the nominal 
time point while the subject is in the CRU . An ECG will also be performed  at the Day 21 follow-
up visit.  All ECGs should be obtained per the schedule of assessments in  Table 5.  
An ECG should be repeated for a change from baseline in QTcF  > 30 ms. 
An ECG will also be performed  if a Grade 3 electrolyte abnormality (such as hyperkalemia) is 
detected to determine if there are any ECG -related changes and/or arrhythmias.   ECGs will also 
be performed  if a subject reports any AE symptoms that are indicative of cardiac signs or 
symptoms.  
11.3.1.5. Cardiac Telemetry  
Standard cardiac telemetric monitoring will begin ≥  2 hours prior to dosing. Telemetry will 
continue for 24 hours post-dose. Subjects may be disconnected from telemetry for 10- minute 
intervals every 2 hours while awake during which time they may engage in mild physical activity such as walking or calf exercises. In addition, they may be disconnected for bathroom visits and personal hygiene needs , as well as for three 20 -minute periods for meals. 
Telemetry will be monitored in real time by qualified personnel, with the assistance of alarms.  If no abnormal rhythms are detected during the observation period, this will be recorded in the source documents along with the exact start and stop times of telemetric observation.  
The telemetry monitors will be programmed to automatically create a printed tracing of any arrhythmia, including tachycardia of Grade 2 or higher (i.e., heart rate greater than 115 bpm). A rhythms tracing can also be m anually printed if the staff notes a rhythm that requires evaluation 
but did not automatically print. The occurrence of an arrhythmia or tachycardia will trigger the evaluation of the subject. If the tracing is found to be due to artifact (ie, subject motion), the tracing will be noted to be ‘not clinically significant’ and will be documented in the source 
documents. The monitor will be programmed to alarm when an abnormal tracing is obtained. 
Any abnormality that is found to be clinically relevant will be documented in the source documents, recorded as an AE, graded per the modified 2014 DMID toxicity scale 
(APPENDIX A ) and potentially trigger additional evaluations as deemed medically appropriate 
(eg, an ECG, pharmacologic treatment ) by the PI.  
11.3.1.6. Echocardiogram  
ECHOs will be obtained per the schedule of assessments ( Table 5 ). The ECHO may be 
performed at any time from screening to Day -2 for eligibility determination. An ECHO will also 
be performed on Day 4. An acceptable window for the Day 4 ECHO is up until Day 5 discharge.  
The ECHO will be performed by trained cardiac sonographers who will provide a real- time 
assessment of EF and cardiac structure. Su bjects must have an EF ≥  55% and have no structural 
abnormalities other than incidental MVP with none- to-trace regurgitation. The screening and 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 59  subsequent ECHO images will be maintained until the subject has completed the study. 
Subsequent ECHOs will be performed in a similar manner by a trained sonographer. All ECHOs 
will be read by a cardiologist. Pre -dose ECHOs will be read prior to dosing. Any new 
abnormalities identified on post- baseline ECHOs confirmed by the cardiologist will be 
documented as AEs and graded as per severity grading scale provided in Section  11.4.1.1. 
11.3.1.7. Clinical Laboratory Screening and Safety Assessments 
Blood and urine samples will be obtained per the schedule of assessments ( Table 5). Screening 
inclusion laboratory tests are listed on Table 6. A list of all laboratory tests that will be  
performed during the study are provided in Table 8.  Laboratory assessments do not require fastin g conditions . Acceptable windows for collection of blood samples for laboratory 
assessments are the same as for the PK samples. Urinalysis (post dose) has an acceptable 
window of ± 2 hours from the nominal time as designated in Table 5. Samples will be collected 
into appropriate tubes as specified by the clinical laboratory.  
Study e ligibility is partially determined by  screening laboratory test s. Inclusion laboratory test 
results  must be within acceptable eligibility range for all labs listed in Table 6 at Screening . For 
all clinical laboratory  safety assessments, the laboratory results values obtained on Day -1 
establish the baseline for chemistry, hematology, and coagulation laboratory safety results.  
Results for Cystatin C, NGAL, and free testosterone (males only) do not need to be obtained prior to initiation of  dosing.  These tests will be used for  baseline measurements for post-dose 
comparison for evaluation of renal and testicular health following administration of galidesivir . 
At time points when multiple samples are taken, the samples will be taken in the following order to minimize the risk of K  EDTA contamination of the biochemistry samples.  
1. Coagulation 
2. Biochemistry / testosterone  
3. PK 
4. Hematology  
Laboratory values drawn after study drug dosing should be assessed within 12 hours of receipt by the PI or qualified designee. Safety lab oratory assessments  can be taken anytime post -dose on 
Days 1  to 5 to fit with the clinic and lab schedule.  Results fro m safety laboratory assessments  
are not required for completing assessments on the following day.  Any laboratory findings outside of the normal range should be documented and described in the source documentation. Results from baseline and on- treatment cl inical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and 
urinalysis tests will be provided to the Sponsor for real -time review.   
Laboratory abnormalities outside of the normal laboratory reference ranges and associated 
grades (according to study specific DMID criteria (modified 2014 DMID Adult Toxicity Grading 
Scale) see APPENDIX A ) should be denoted where possible. For those analyte results t hat are 
out of the normal range and do not have an established DMID toxicity criteria, the PI should 
assess the abnormalities and provide severity grading as defined in Section 11.4.1.2.  
All laboratory samples will be analyzed by a local laboratory associated with the site. Reference ranges for each local laboratory will be provided to the Sponsor and included in data listings. For 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 60  out-of- range labo ratory findings, the interpretation of clinically significant or not clinically 
significant should be denoted in the source records. Clinically significant laboratory findings in 
the opinion of the Investigator should be recorded as AEs  and handled as described in 
Section  11.4.  Laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be clinically significant by the 
Investigator are not reported as AEs.  All laboratory findings will be summarized and reported with appropriate grading, regardless of whether or not they are  reported as  AEs.   
Cystatin C, NGAL, testosterone, CK-MB, troponin and UACR will be analyzed as outlined in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan.  Briefly, changes from baseline will be measured for each analyte.  
Values outside the normal limits, if applicable, will be graded based on fold changes in comparison to the upper or lower limit of normal.  Marked changes in these analytes will be taken as potential indications of impaired organ function and qualitative interpretation will take into account subject incidence, clinical course, and comparison to placebo for the safety analyses 
in the final study report.

• Amphetamines  
• Barbiturates  
• Benzodiazepines  
• Methamphetamine  
• Ecstasy  
• Phencyclidine 
• Tricyclic antidepressants  
• Opiates  
 
Urine alcohol and cotinine tests will also  be conducted at Screening and Day -1.  A positive 
result for either test is  also exclusionary.   
11.3.1.7.3. Pregnancy Screen  
A serum pr egnancy test should be drawn at Screening for all female subjects, regardless of their 
contraceptive status or whether they practice abstinence. FSH will be measured at screening in women who declare themselves as postmenopausal for ≤  2 years to establish childbearing status.  
All other pregnancy tests performed during the study may be urine pregnancy tests. A serum pregnancy test should immediately be drawn and sent for analysis following any positive urine pregnancy test. 
11.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse  Events  
AEs will be assessed and recorded from the time of signing the ICF through the appropriate 
follow-up period.  
11.4.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
11.4.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject. No causal relationship 
with the study drug/IMP or with the clinical study itself is implied. An AE may be an 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or worsens during the clinical study. Clinically relevant abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including 
abnormal laboratory findings (eg, requiring unscheduled diagnostic procedures or treatment 
measures, or resulting in withdrawal from the study) are considered to be AEs. Abnormal laboratory findings that are not deemed clinically significant by the Investigator are not 
considered to be AEs. 
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol- specified 
AE reporting period (see Section 11.4).  
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 63  • Findings from protocol-mandated interventions. This can include laboratory 
assessments performed during the clinical study. AEs should only be reported if the abnormalities are changes from baseline and are clinically significant as described above.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by the Investigator  to have worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in character during the protocol- specified AE 
reporting period.  
An adverse reaction is defined in Article 2(n) of Directive 2001/20/EC as follows: all untoward and unintended responses to a study drug/IMP related to any dose administered. The definition also covers medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse 
and abuse of the product. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug/IMP. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
Surgical procedures should not be reported as AEs. The condition for which the surgery is 
required should be reported as the AE, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical study protocol and the conditions(s) leading to these 
measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment. 
In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical history.  
AEs are designated as “nonserious” or “serious.”  
11.4.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, baseline, treatment, washout, or follow-
up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or more of the following: 
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization  
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject’s health or may require medical or su rgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events may include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, 
or convulsions that do not result in subject hospitalization.  
In addition, the Sponsor considers any abortions (elective or spontaneous), fetal demise, and still birth to be SAEs for reporting purposes.  
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 64  Overdose will be considered an SAE only if any of the seriousness criteria are met. Any cl inical 
complication in association with the overdose should be reported as an AE or SAE (as 
applicable) along with the event of overdose. Details of signs or symptoms, clinical management, and outcome should be reported, if available. Overdose without associated signs or symptoms should not be recorded as AEs but should be recorded as a protocol deviation.  
Severity of Event: All AEs will be assessed (graded) for severity using the modified 2014 
DMID Adult Toxicity Grading Scale (see APPENDIX A). Any AEs no t covered by the DMID 
criteria will be assessed and classified into one of three clearly defined severity categories as follows: 
Mild:  (Grade 1): Transient or mild symptoms; no limitation in activity; no 
intervention required. The AE does not interfere with the participant’s normal 
functioning level. It may be an annoyance. 
Moderate:  (Grade 2): Symptom results in mild to moderate limitation in activity; no or 
minimal intervention required. The AE produces some impairment of 
functioning, but it is not hazardous to health. It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
Severe:  (Grade 3): Symptom results in significant limitation in activity; medical intervention may be required. The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Severity refers to the medical perspective of an event whereas  seriousness reflects the outcome 
of the event (ie, hospitalization). Events of mild severity can lead to hospitalization and therefore be serious w hereas  severe events such as a headache may not meet seriousness criteria.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of ea ch episode.  
11.4.1.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
No adverse events of special interest have been identified for galidesivir.   
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 65  11.4.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
The PI or medically qualified designee must review each AE and make the determination of 
relationship to study drug using the following guidelines.  The Sponsor uses five categories of 
relatedness. The category of “Not Related” and “Likely Not R elated” map to the DMID category 
of “Not Related”, wh ereas the categories of “Possibly Related”, “ Probably Related ” and 
“Definitely Related ” map to the DMID category of “Related”. The categories are described 
below: 
Not Related:  The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s 
underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident, and no 
temporal relationship exists between the study drug and the event. 
Likely N ot 
Related:  The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from drug 
administration and is readily explained by the subject’s clinical state or by 
other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
Possibly Related:  There is some temporal relationship between the event and the administration 
of the study drug and the event is unlikely to be explained by the subject’s 
medical condition, other therapies, or accident.  
Probably Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration, 
abates upon discontinuation of the drug, and cannot be reasonably explained 
by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Definitely Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administration, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study 
drug, is confirmed by improvement upon stopping the study drug (dechallenge), and reappears upon repeated exposure ( rechallenge, if 
rechallenge is medically appropriate).  
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study drug is part of the documentation process. All AEs whether or not deemed related to study drug require reporting. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported 
11.4.3. Recording Adverse Events  
AEs and SAEs will be assessed and recorded from the time of signing of the ICF through the 
appropriate follow -up period. AEs and SAEs will be followed to adequate resolution or 
stabilization to new baseline.  
11.4.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
Any SAE must be reported by phone in real time to the Sponsor Medical Monitor and in writing 
using the SAE report form within 24 hours of the PI’s awareness of the SAE via email or fax (or 
both). In addition, all SAEs must be recorded on the AE eCRF in real time. All additional 
follow-up evaluations of the SAE must be reported to BioCryst or its designee as soon as they are available. The SAE report forms should be sent to the following email or fax number (or both): 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 66  Email: mmgalidesivir @biocryst.com AND safety@biocryst.com 
Fax: +1 919 226-5888 
Immediate reporting should allow BioCryst to take the appropriate measures to address potential 
new risks in a clinical study . Therefore, the initial report should be submitted by the PI within a 
very short period of time and under no circumstances should this period exceed 24 hours following awareness of the SAE. 
The follow-up report should allow BioCryst to determine whether the SAE requires a 
reassessment of the unreasonable risk profile of the study drug in clinical study , if the relevant 
information was not already available and provided in the initial report. 
BioCryst will in turn do the following in real time: Contact the DMID medical monitor  
Submit the SAE to:  
DMID Pharmacovigilance  Group (PVG), Clinical Research Operations and Management 
Support (CROMS), 6500 Rock Spring Dr. Suite 650, Bethesda, MD 20817, USA 
SAE Hot Line: 1 -800-537-9979 (U.S.) or 1-301-897-1709 (outside U.S.) 
SAE FAX Phone Number: 1-800-275-7619 (U.S.) or 1-301-897-1710 (outside U.S.) 
SAE Email Address: PVG@dmidcroms.com 
The DMID Clinical Project  Manager and DMID Medical Monitor will be notified of the SAE  by 
the DMID PVG. The DMID Medical Monitor will review and assess the SAE for potential 
impact on study subject safety and protocol conduct. 
The Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) will be contacted  by the PI in real time, and  will then 
assess the event and the subject  (see Section  11.5.1).  
The Sponsor is responsible for determining regulatory reporting requirements and will provide 
the PI with reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The CRU is responsible for submitting any SUSAR or I nvestigational N ew D rug (IND) safety repo rt (initial 
and follow-up) or other safety information (eg, revised IB) to the IRB and for retaining a copy in its files, unless otherwise instructed. 
11.4.5. Regulatory Reporting 
A SUSAR is an unexpected serious AE of which the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product information (eg, IB) and there is a reasonable possibility that the event was 
due to use of the study drug or due to a protocol- mandated procedure.  
The term “severity” describes the intensity of a specific event and therefore,  has to be 
distinguished from the term “serious”. Reports that  add significant information about the 
specificity, increase of occurrence, or severity of a known, already documented serious adverse 
reaction constitute unexpected events.  
The expectedness of an adverse reaction is determined by the Sponsor in the R eference S afety 
Information (RSI) on the basis of the events previously observed, not on the basis of what might 
be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the study drug/IMP. The RSI is contained 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 67  in the IB in a clearly identified section that includes information on the frequency and nature of 
the adverse reactions. The RSI may change during the conduct of the clinical study and this 
would be a substantial amendment. For the purpose of SUSAR reporting, the version of the RSI at the moment of occurrence of the SUSAR applies. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to determine whether an event requires expedited reporting 
and to notify the PI of its decision as soon as possible. SUSARs  will be subject to expedited 
reporting.  
Where expedited reporting is required, the following procedures should be followed. 
Fatal or life -threatening SUSARs:  
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to report fatal or life -threatening  SUSARs to the FDA, as 
soon as possible, but no later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor first became aware of the 
reaction.  
The PI is required to notify the IRB of any SUSAR as soon as possible, but no later than 7 
calendar days after he or she first became aware of the reaction. Any additional relevant 
information should be sent within 8 days of the report. 
Other SUSARs  
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to report other SUSARs  to the FDA as soon as possible, but 
no later than 15 calendar days aft er it first became aware of the reaction.  
The PI is required to notify the IRB of any other SUSAR as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after he or she first became aware of the reaction.  
11.4.6. Periodic Reporting  
On an annual basis and as per a ll local requirements, the Sponsor will provide periodic reports to 
all competent authorities regarding safety for the product. In the United S tates, this requirement 
is met by submitting an IND annual report or a development safety update report ( DSUR ) to the 
FDA which will list a summary  of most frequent and most serious adverse experiences by body 
system, a summary of all IND safety reports submitted during the reporting period, a list of 
subjects who died during participation and cause of death, and a list of subjects who dropped out 
during the course of the investigation in association with any adverse experience, whether or not thought to be drug related.  
11.4.7. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects will be instructed that if they/their partner become pregnant dur ing the study this should 
be reported to the PI immediately. The PI should also be notified of pregnancy occurring after 
completion of the study for female subjects 30 days after the last dose of study drug and partners 
of male subjects 90 days after the last dose of study drug . In the event that a subject or subject’s 
partner is subsequently found to be pregnant after the volunteer is included in the study, then 
consent will be sought from the pregnant female subject or partner of a male subject and, if 
granted, any pregnancy will be followed and the status of mother and/or child will be reported to 
the Sponsor after delivery. Any subject who reports pregnancy during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 68  While pregnancy is not considered an AE, all ca ses of fetal drug exposure via the parent as a 
study participant (including partners of study participants) are to be reported immediately to 
BioCryst or its designee. Information related to the pregnancy must be given on a “Pregnancy Confirmation and Outc ome” form that will be provided by the Sponsor or its designee so that the 
pregnancy may be followed and an outcome determined. Any AEs or SAEs experienced by a pregnant subject are to be reported as directed above in Sections  11.4.1.1 and 11.4.1.2. Any 
complications reported in a subject’s pregnant partner should be reported on the Pregnancy 
Confirmation and Outcome form. All pregnancies must be followed to outcome which occurs 
when an infant is delivered (live or still born), when there is fetal demise, or when there is an abortion (spontaneous or induced). Any congenital abnormalities in the newborn should be 
reported as separate SAEs. In addition, abortion (spontaneous or elective), fetal demise and 
stillbirth are considered SAEs.  
A pregnancy that is reported while a subject is on study drug through the visit follow- up time 
frame will be captured in electronic data capture (EDC)  and reported on the Pregnancy Report 
form for entry into both the clinical database and the safety database. All further follow -up of the 
pregnancy through resolution (abortion, either elective  or spontaneous, fetal demise, still birth, or 
live birth) will be captured on a Pregnancy Confirmation and Outcome form and entered only 
into the safety database becau se these data are not statistically analyzed and would cause the 
clinical database to remain open, thus preventing adequate analysis of the Phase 1 data.  
Pregnancy in a subject that is reported after the final study visit until 30 days after the last study  
drug dose for female subjects or 90 days after the last study drug dose for partners of male subjects will be reported on the Pregnancy Report form and captured only in the safety database.  
The pregnancy will not be entered into the clinical database, allowing the database to be locked 
and the data analyzed. All further follow-up of the pregnancy through resolution (abortion either elective or spontaneous, fetal demise, still birth, or live birth) will be captured on Pregnancy Confirmation and Outcome For ms and entered only into the safety database.  
All pregnancy information including any follow up known at that time will be reported in the annual safety reporting required for a product in development. In the United States,  this is met by 
the FDA required IND annual report or the DSUR if waiver is obtained from the FDA. In the European Union this is met by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) required DSUR.  
11.4.8. Urgent Safety Measures  
If the CRU or any of its staff or contractors  becomes aware of an actual or potential urgent safety 
issue, then the Sponsor must be immediately contacted so that appropriate urgent safety measures can be agreed upon. An urgent safety  issue is defined as:  
• An immediate hazard to the health or safety o f subjects participating in a clinical 
study 
• A serious risk to human health or potentially a serious risk to human health 
An urgent safety issue may include issues with an investigational drug or comparators, study 
procedures, inter- current illness  (including pandemic infections), concomitant medications, 
concurrent medical conditions, or any other issues related to the safe conduct of the study or that 
pose a risk to study subjects. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 69  In exceptional circumstances of imminent hazard and in order to safeguard the health or safety of 
individuals, the CRU  may take urgent safety measures before informing the Sponsor, but the 
Sponsor must be informed immediately after the hazard has resolved.  
The Sponsor will take responsibility for informing appropriate competent  authorities, 
Investigators, and IRB. 
11.4.9. Reporting of Urgent Safety Issues  
The Sponsor is required to inform the appropriate competent authorities, Investigator s, and IRB 
within 3 calendar days of the urgent safety issue.  
11.4.10. Serious Breaches  
It is the responsibi lity of the Sponsor to notify the licensing authority of any serious breach that 
is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or mental integrity of the subjects in  the 
study or the scientific value of the study. 
11.5. Safety Oversight  
Safety oversig ht will be provided by the means of an ISM, a DEC, and an SMC. 
11.5.1. Independent Safety Monitor  
The investigative site will have a physician ISM who is not part of the clinical study staff and has 
no direct study responsibilities. The ISM’s responsibility will b e the review of all SAEs and if 
needed, any AEs of special  interest. The ISM may use all available data at the site including 
examination of the subject. The ISM will summarize his/her findings in a report that will be forwarded to the DEC and the SMC within 24 hours of the event. 
The ISM must be available during the entire duration of the study or a back -up must be identified 
and available during the primary ISM’s absence.  
11.5.2. Dose Escalation Committee  
Following the completion of each cohort, the DEC will meet to decide if the required safety 
parameters have been met.  All available safety data for all subjects in a given cohort through 
96 hours and PK data through 24 hours post- dose will be reviewed by the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, and PI and used in the decision to escalate to the next higher dose. Review meetings will be held following each dose level of Cohorts 1 to 4.  
An interim Safety Summary Report will be prepared for review by the DEC that will document 
the following safety findings for each dose cohort: 
• Demographics 
• Dosing information, including any subjects who discontinued dosing 
• Listing of any SAEs with assessm ent of severity 
• Listing of AEs with assessment of severity  
• Listing of any graded clinical chemistry findings  
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 70  • Listing of all clinical chemistry findings Grade 2 or higher  
• Listing of any graded hematology findings  
• Listing of all hematology findings  
• Listing of any graded urinalysis findings  
• Listing of all urinalysis findings  
• Listing of vital signs  
• Listing of QT findings  
• Telemetry findings  
• Additional narrative summaries  
• Listing of subjects who terminated early  
• Listing of PE data  
An interim PK report will be prepared for review by the DEC that will document the following 
PK findings for each dose cohort: 
• Preliminary plasma PK parameters (through 24-hours post-dose) based upon nominal times: AUC; C
max, Tmax, terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2; median, m inimum, 
maximum, g eometric m ean, coefficient of variation [CV%])  
• Predictions of C max and AUC values for the next cohort, where relevant 
The interim Safety Summary and PK report documents will form the basis of teleconferences 
involving the Sponsor and the PI to evaluate each completed cohort in the study.  The DEC will 
use the Dose Escalation Criteria to determine whether  escalation as planned per protocol may 
commence.  
Dose Escalation Criteria  
The study will proceed to the next planned dose level if NONE  of the following is met: 
• One or more subjects with a treatment -emergent QT interval corrected by Fridericia's 
formula (QTcF) > 480 ms (Grade 2 per the DMID scale) as determined from bedside 
ECGs (with repeat ECG). If this occurs, the SMC may consult with an independent 
cardiologist as needed.  If it is deemed acceptable to restart the study following review of the data and discussion with an independent cardiologist, if needed, dosing may resume.  
• One or more subjects experiences an increase in BP that requires acute treatment, or has a confirmed systolic BP > 160 mmHg, or a confirmed diastolic BP >  100 mmHg 
(Grade 3 per DMID scale). Confirmed BP changes require at least 2 measurements at least 2 hours apart, each measured after at least 5 minutes of supine rest. 
• Anaphylactic reaction occurs in one subject. 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 71  • One or more subjects experience a similar Grade 3 treatment -emergent laboratory 
abnormality or AE that is suspected to be drug- related as determined by the 
investigator.  
• One subject experiences an S AE. 
• A cohort’s median AUC 24 is ≥ 52,500 ng.h/mL, equivalent to the NOAEL exposure 
in cynomolgus monkeys.   
If any of the above criteria are met, escalation to the next planned dose cohort will not proceed 
until all available study data have been reviewed by the independent SMC, as per Section  11.5.3.  
If, following review by the SMC ( Section  11.5.3) it is deemed acceptable to restart the study, 
dosing will resume.  All relevant data will be submitted to the regulatory authorities and IRB.  
11.5.3. Safety Monitoring Committee 
A SMC will be assembled for this study. The SMC membership is determined by NIAID, who is 
also responsible for the C harter . The SMC will review reports provided by the PI and Sponsor as 
outlined in the Charter and agreed upon in the organizational meeting. 
The SMC will meet to review all available safety and PK data from the study  on the following 
occasions:  when study halting criteria are met, when dose escalation could not be approved by 
the DEC, or when the criteria for not dosing additional subjects in a cohort are met after the 
sentinel subjects are dosed . A final SMC meeting will occur approximately 6 to 8 months 
following clinical database lock to review the cumulative unblinded safety data for the study.  
Data for all SMC meetings will be provided in a standard summary format. The SMC may be 
asked to provide recommendations in response to questions posed by DMID. Additionally, 
following the administration of Cohort 4 and a review of the PK  and safety data b y the SMC, the 
Sponsor may make a recommendation to enroll additional cohorts in the SAD to further 
characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of galidesivir. This  additional enrollment will only 
occur provided that the PK is increasing predictably in pr oportion with increasing dose, no safety 
concerns have arisen or stopping criteria have been met, the exposure is below the NOEAL exposure identified in NHP studies, and with recommendation by the SMC. The protocol will be amended to enable the enrollment of any SAD cohorts after Cohort 4. 
The recommendations and final minutes of any SMC meeting will be supplied to the Sponsor, 
FDA and IRB, as applicable. 
12. STATISTICS  
12.1. Study Hypothesis  
No formal study hypothesis will be stated or tested in this Phase 1 study.  
12.2. Sample Size Considerations  
No formal power or sample size calculations were used to determine cohort sizes. Cohort sizes 
were based upon experience in other SAD Phase 1 studies. A sample size of 6 subjects receiving 
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 72  active drug per cohort should provide adequate characterization of PK and safety assessments 
within this setting.  
12.3. Final Analysis Plan  
12.3.1. Statistical Methods  
A detailed S tatistical A nalysis Plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to database lock. 
The SAP will describe the methods of analyses/summaries, including all endpoints, time points, 
populations, missing data, etc. Any deviation from the analyses outlined in the SAP will be 
described in the final CSR. 
12.3.1.1. Analysis Populations 
The analysis populations are defined below. Data from placebo-treated subjects will be pooled across cohorts.   
Safety Population 
The safety population will include all randomized subjects who received any amount of study 
drug (ie, a partial infusion). Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment received. This 
population will be used for all analyses of accountability, demographics, galidesivir drug concentration, and safety. 
Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK population will include all subjects for whom PK parameters can be estimated. The PK 
population will be the primary population for the PK analysis. 
12.3.1.2. Subject Demographic and Disposition Data  
Subject disposition will be presented for all subjects. The number of subjects who completed the 
study and discontinued from the study will be provided. All pertinent subject demographics will be presented using descriptive statistics. The reasons for early discontinuation will be presented. 
12.3.1.3. Analysis of Safety Vari ables  
AEs will be mapped to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred 
term (PT) and system organ classification (SOC). Any event reported on the subject’s study record that occurs on or after the initiation of study drug is defined as treatment emergent. 
Additionally, it is assumed that an AE that is reported to have started on Day 1 of a given 
treatment period without an associated onset time may have occurred after the initiation of study drug. Hence, AEs occurring on Day 1 with no associated onset time will be assumed to be 
treatment emergent. The occurrence of TEAEs will be summarized by cohort and treatment 
assignment  using MedDRA PTs, SOCs, and severity. Separate summaries of treatment -emergent 
SAEs and AEs considered to be rela ted to study drug will be generated. All AEs will be listed for 
individual subjects showing both verbatim and preferred terms.  
Descriptive summaries of vital signs, ECG parameters (12 lead and telemetry), ECHOs, and 
clinical laboratory results will be pre sented separately for each cohort by study visit and 
treatment assignment . Laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the modified DMID 
criteria ( APPENDIX A).  
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 73  Any graded abnormality that occurs following the initiation of study drug and represents at least 
one grade increase from the baseline assessment is defined as treatment emergent. The number 
and percentage of subjects experiencing treatment -emergent graded toxicities will be 
summarized by treatment group. Laboratory toxicity shifts from baseline to post- baseline 
assessments will be summarized by treatment group.  
PE results will be presented in listings. Changes in PE  results that are AEs will be reported in AE 
tables.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization  (WHO) 
Dictionary. These data will be summarized by cohort and treatment assignment . 
Subjects receiving placebo will be pooled and reported together across cohorts. 
12.3.1.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Concentrations of galidesivir will be determined by validated plasma and urine assays and will 
be summarized by treatment and displayed in figures. Plasma PK parameters for each subject will be estimated over the sampling interval using noncompartmental analysis (Phoenix 
WinNonlin Version 7.0 or higher, Certa ra) and summarized by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics. The amount and percentage of galidesivir excreted in the urine will be assessed at all 
doses. If possible, data will be summarized by cohort and dose proportionality assessed.  
The PK parameters that will be estimated for galidesivir are listed in Table 9 . Additional 
analyses may be conducted as appropriate.  
Table 9: Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Pharmacokinetic 
Parameter  Definition  
AUC inf Area under the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to 
infinite time, calculated as AUC last + (C last/λz) 
AUC t Area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to 
time “t” ; may be denoted as AUC last if the “t” is the last timepoint 
with a measurable concentration  
% AUC exp  Percentage of AUC extrapolated between AUC last and AUC inf 
Clast Last measurable concentration of drug  
Cmax Maximum observed concentration of drug  
t1/2 Estimate of the terminal elimination half -life of the drug  
CL CL = Dose/AUC  
where “Dose” is the dose of the drug and AUC = AUC inf  
λz Terminal elimination rate constant, estimate by linear regression of 
the terminal eliminatio n phase of the concentration of drug versus 
time curve  
Vz Volume of distribution of the drug  
Tmax Time to Cmax 
CL r Renal clearance of unchanged drug in a specific interval 
(CL r [interval]) or cumulatively over all collection intervals  
% Dose excreted  Percentage of given dose excreted in the urine as unchanged drug  
Protocol BCX4430-106/DMID 18-0013  Galidesivir, Version 3.0 
 
 74   
In all derivations of PK parameters, zero will be substituted for concentrations below the 
quantitation limit ( BQL ) of the assay.  Samples that  are BQL,  but are between two  samples with 
detectable concentrations will be excluded from PK analysis.  
12.3.1.5. Dose Proportionality of Galidesivir 
Dose proportionality will be evaluated over all doses and will be based upon AUC inf, AUC t, and 
Cmax using both the power model and the analysis of variance ANOVA method. 
12.3.1.5.1. Power Model  
The power m odel is as follows: 
Equation 1: 
log(Y ik) = S i[1] +β × log (Dose k) + ε ik  
where Y ik is the measured response variable, AUC inf, AUC t, and C max, on the kth dose, 
Si[1] is random subject effect for the ith subject, and ε ikis the random error.  After 
exponentiation, the model equation 1 is identical to equation 2 (below). 
Equation 2: 
Yik = α × Doseβ  
where α includes the error.  
Dose proportionality for PK parameters will be assessed by restricted maximum likelihood using 
SAS PROC MIXED. The mean slope will be estimated from the power model and the 
corresponding 90% CI calculated. 
12.3.1.5.2. Analysis of Variance 
Following log -e transformation, dose- normalized PK parameters will be analyzed with an 
ANOVA model using PROC MIXED. Each dose will b e compared with a reference dose on a 
pair-wise basis. The ratio of GLS means and the corresponding 90% CI will be estimated for 
each PK parameter of interest.  
13. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/ DOCUMENTS  
The study site will maintain appropriate medical and res earch records for this study, in 
compliance with International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) E6, Secti on 4.9 and regulatory

quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study safety and progress.  
13.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of BioCryst (this may include a representative from a contract -research organization) will visit the investigational 
study site to: 
• Determine the adequacy  of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities regarding protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of BioCryst or its representatives. 
During the study, the representative acting on behalf of BioCryst will have regular contacts with the investigational site for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the subject’s medical records at  the hospital or practice, and other 
records relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for 
each subject (e.g. clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to BioCryst. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to BioCryst and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice. 
Site monitoring of this study will be conducted, as described in the study- specific Site 
Monitoring Plan, to ensure that human subject protection, study procedures, laboratory, study 
intervention administration, and data collection processes are of high quality and meet the Sponsor , ICH E6 /GCP , and regulatory guidelines.  
13.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of BioCryst,  a regulatory authority, or an IRB may visit the study site 
to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a BioCryst audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study- related activities and

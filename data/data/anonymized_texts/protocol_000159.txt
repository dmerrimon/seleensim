Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            7 
 1.  Introduction and Rationale 
 
Broader indications for the implant of cardiac implantable electronic devices  (CIED), a 
higher prevalence of systolic heart failure and population aging are the main reasons for the 
continuous increase in the use of pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy .  The rate of infection is out of proportion to 
the increase in implantation rate.  T his is thought to be primarily due to the associated 
comorbities in CIED patients, the greater complexity of the devices, and the increased duration of procedures.   
 
The CanGaroo  ECM Envelope is a ‘pouch’ in which a cardiac implantable electronic device 
is placed prior to implantation to create a stable environment and to provide a barrier between the CIED and the soft tissue of the patient and a barrier from the CIED leads.  
 
CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. received FDA 510(k) premarket clearance for the CanGaroo  
ECM (K140306) on August 15, 2014.  This post market observational study will evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness of  CanGaroo  ECM following  an implantable electronic device 
procedure utilizing  CanGaroo  ECM.  Specific data will be collected at the first post-
operative visit.  
   
 
2. Indication for Use   
The CanGaroo  ECM Envelope is intended to securely hold an implantable electronic device 
to create a stable environment  when implanted in the body. The devices that may be used 
with the CanGaroo  ECM Envelope include pacemaker pulse generators , defibrillators, or 
other cardiac implantable electronic  device.  The entire Instructions for Use ( IFU) can be 
found in Appendix C. 
 
3. Description   
 
The CanGaroo  ECM is constructed from a multilaminate sheet (4 -ply) of decellularized, non-
crosslinked, lyophilized extracellular matrix  (ECM) derived from porcine small intestinal 
submucosa (SIS).  SIS is a natural collagen construct derived from a select layer of tissue that 
is recovered from porcine small intestine.  During processing, the inner and outer muscle layers of the intestine are removed, leaving an intact, de cellularized , submucosa with a 
portion of the tunica propria layer attached to the inner surface.  The CanGaroo  ECM 
Envelope will be provided sterile and is intended for single use in a single patient only.  Over time, the device will be reinforced by cellular infiltration and tissue growth that will integrate 
the CanGaroo  ECM Envelope. 
  
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            8 
 4. Prior Clinical Evaluations  
 
 ECM has been studied in previous prospective clinical evaluation, and a post- market clinical 
study is ongoing.  The ECM for Pericardial closure has been studied in a randomized, 
prospective study to evaluate its ability to reduce the incidence of new onse t atrial 
fibrillation; the ECM for Carotid Repair is under evaluation in a post-market study to capture and assess device performance data from subjects undergoing patch angioplasty of the carotid artery following carotid endarterectomy using the product per its FDA -cleared 
Indications for Use; and a post market study to capture additional information (RECON) from subjects undergoing a procedure requiring pericardial closure using the product per its FDA-cleared Indications for Use.   
 
4.1.Clinical Evaluation of the ECM Pericardial Closure Device  
 
The ECM Pericardial Closure device was evaluated in a multicenter,  prospective, 
randomized, controlled clinical study, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device to reduce the incidence of new onset post operative atrial fibrillation by 
circumferentially reconstructing the normal pericardial anatomy following isolated, first-time, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures as compared to the control group subjects who did not undergo pericardial closure.   Safety was to be established by 
demonstrating that the composite clinical event rate for the ECM group was not worse than the control group.  Effectiveness was to be established by demonstrating a reduced incidence of new onset post-operative atrial fibrillation in the ECM group as compared to the control group.  440 patients at 15 U.S. sites were enrolled between December 2010 and November 2012 and randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the ECM group (pericardial closure) or the control group (no pericardial closure).  A blinded, independent core 
laboratory evaluated all arrhythmia data to determine if subjects met the effectiveness 
endpoints.  A blinded, independent Clinical Events Committee adjudicated all safety  
endpoint events.  Pa tients were evaluated at hospital discharge, 30 days and 270 days 
postoperatively.  Subjects were adults (at least 18 years of age) with no prior history of 
atrial fibrillation or history of anti -arrhythmia drug treatment in the past three months and 
no implantable cardiac devices (i.e., cardiac resynch ronization therapy devices with and 
without defibrillator capabilities  [CRT-Ds and CRTs), implantable cardioverter -
defibrillators [ICDs] and pacemakers)  undergoing isolated, first -time CABG with a 
median ster notomy approach.  
 
The primary  effectiveness en dpoint, superiority of the ECM over no pericardial closure 
for reduction in the incidence of new onset post- operative atrial fibrillation,  was not met. 
The study results showed that the rate of new onset post-operative atrial fibrillation for the primary effectiveness endpoint was similar between the two groups, with a rate of 38.3% in the ECM group compared with 35.9% in the control group.  The two secondary effectiveness endpoints, the rate of treated or sustained episodes of new onset 
postoperative atrial fibrillation (defined as a single episode that last 15 minutes or more) and the rate of treated episodes of new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation showed results were also similar between the two groups. 
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            9 
  
The composite primary safety endpoint event rates for the ECM and control group were 
3.9% and 3.7%, respectively.  Using the pro tocol specified non- inferiority margin, 7.5%, 
the ECM was shown to be non- inferior to control for the primary safety endpoint 
(p<0.001).  Therefore, the primar y safety endpoint for the study was achieved.  The 
composite secondary safety  event rate was similar for the two groups (5.8% for the ECM 
group com pared with 3.9% for the control group) demonstrating no significant increase 
in the rate  of bypass graft failure in the ECM group compared with the control group. 
 Although the study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of new onset post-operative atrial fibrillation, the study demonstrated that the ECM for Pericardial Closure continues to be safe for its intended use, with no significant increase in the rate of bypass graft failure or cardiac tamponade compared with no pericardial closure.  
4.2 Post-market Clinical Evaluation of the ECM for Carotid Repair  
 
Aziyo is currently conducting a post- market registry study for the ECM for Carotid 
Repair (Protocol No. 11- PR-1021).  The objective of this registry is to capture and assess 
device performance data from subjects undergoing patch angioplasty of the c arotid artery  
following carotid endarterectomy using the ECM for Ca rotid Repair per its commercial 
Indications for Use.  This registry provides an ongoing post- market surveillance 
mechanism to document clinical outcomes on the use of the ECM for Carotid Repair.  This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, post- market, observational registry of 
subjects receiving the ECM for Carotid Repair for patch angioplasty following carotid endarterectomy procedures.  This post-
market registry may involve up to ten U.S. clinic al sites and up to 230 subjects.   Data will 
be collected through the 24-month follow-up. 
One-hundred and eighty-six patients are enrolled in the study and included in t he interim 
analysis of the ECM for Carotid Repair registry .  The data demonstrated that the rate of 
device related adverse events were consistent with the rates found in the review of the 
contemporary literature for patch angioplasty .  Specifically, no unanticipated events were 
found and the rate of the events was as anticipated in the risk management plan.  Of specific interest in the analysis was the rate of pseudoaneurysm, which was present in 2 (1.08%) of the 186 patients and compared favorably to the rates found in the literature (1.4% to 5%). 
The mean carotid stenosis (maximum) at pre -operative was 84.8%.  Mean change from 
baseline values were -56.8%, -57.9%, and -59.6% at the 1 to 3-month, 6-month, and 12-
month follow-up evaluations.  The mean carotid stenosis (minimum) at pre -operative was 
71.7%.  Mean change from baseline values were -63.9%, -61.2%, and -63.4% at the 1 to 
3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up evaluations. 
 As a result of this analysis and the directed and ongoing risk management activities, the overall residual risk of the ECM for Carotid Repair is determined to be a cceptable.  
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            10 
 5. Study Objectives  
 
The objective of the SECURE Study is to actively gather additional information on the use of 
the CanGaroo ECM® Envelope in a post market observational study. 
 
Endpoints 
The endpoints will be defined as: 1. The proportion of subjects with CanGaroo ECM related adverse events.  
2. The incidence of major pocket infection. 
 
Major infection will be defined as 1) superficial cellulitis in the region of the CIED pocket with wound dehiscence, erosion or purulent drainage, 2) deep incisional or organ/space (pocket) surgical site infection, 3) persistent bacteremia or 4) endocarditis.  Minor CIED infections include any that do not meet the definition of a major CIED infection.  Documentation will also be provided in the medical records.   
 
6.  Study Design 
 
This is a multi-center post-market observational study.  It is anticipated that up to 1000 
subjects will be enrolled  at up to 50 centers .  Eligible candidates will be approached to 
ascertain interest in study participation at their initial follow up visit.  If a subject is interested in participating and has had CanGaroo  ECM used in their procedure, they will be asked to 
allow their physician  to use their medical information from the procedure and four follow up 
visits.  An informed consent will be provided to the patient and the patient will be asked to 
sign unless a Waiver of Documentation of Consent has been obtained.  If a Waiver of Documentation of Consent is in effect, all elements of the approved informed consent will be provided verbally and the process will be documented in the subject study binder by the research staff for either method of consent.   
 
7.  Study Population 
 
The study population will consist of any subject who has received the CanGaroo  ECM® 
Envelope for an implantable electronic device placement .  Subjects will be considered 
enrolled into the study once they have provided informed consent and completed the procedure using the CanGaroo ECM Envelope.  Before any subject can be enrolled, the site 
must have IRB approval from a centralized IRB or their specific institution IRB for the 
protocol and Informed Consent Form to be used at that site and Waiver of Documentation of Consent, if applicable.   
8.  Study Methods  
 
Study procedures are standardized to the extent possible and all study- related data will be 
captured on a standardized Case Report Form  and entered by sponsor personnel into Clindex, 
Version 3.11.0.1027R, an electronic data capture software. A copy of the Case Report Form  
is provided in Appendix B. 
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            11

10. Adverse Event Reporting 
10.1 Definitions 
 
Adverse Event (AE)  
 Adverse event (AE) will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any untoward clinical signs in subjects whether or not related to the device.  This includes events related to the device and to the procedure involved.   For this post market clinical study only events that relate to the use of the CanGaroo ECM will be co llected and is defined below in Adverse Device Effect.  
 
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            12 
 Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
An Adverse Device Effect  is defined as a clinical sign, symptom, or condition that is 
causally related to the device procedure, the presence of the device, or the performance of 
the device.  Due to the temporal proximity of the AE to product administration, there is a reasonable possibility that the product may have caused the AE or may have contributed to the severity or duration of an event caused by other means.   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is defined as an event that:  a) led to death, b) led to serious 
deterioration in health that either:  
1) Resulted in life threatening illness or injury, or 
2) Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, or 
3) Required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
4) Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
 A planned hospitalization for pre -existing condition without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered to be a serious event.   
  
10.2 Assessing and Recording Adverse Events  
 
Each AE recorded must be documented on the Case Report Form.  All serious and device related events must be reported immediately to Aziyo via telephone or email within 24 
hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event.  The case report form will be submitted  to Aziyo.  The site will be  contacted by Aziyo for additional information 
including, but not limited to: 
 
• Description of the event and underlying cause (diagnosis), coexisting disease, or 
other.  The AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the subject’s own words when possible. 
• Date of onset and date of resolution.  If the event is present at the single post -
operative visit it will be noted as unresolved.  
• Intensity of the event :  mild, moderate, or severe.  
• Frequency of the event:  single episode, intermittent, or continuous. 
• Action taken:  none, medication, procedure, medication and procedure, or other.   
• Relationship to the device/ procedure /surgery:  not-related, possibly- related, or 
probably- related.  
 The Investigat or must ensure that the details of the  event are documented in the medical 
notes including full details of the outcome, in addition to recording the event on the case report form.
   
 
All procedure and device related serious adverse events that are associated with the use of the device will be evaluated in accordance with the protocol and the Sponsor’s Incident/Event Reporting SOP.  Any serious adverse event that requires a Medical 
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            13 
 Device Report will be reported by the Sponsor to the FDA in accordance with Sponsor’s 
Medical Device Reporting SOP.  The site should contact:

10.3 Possible Adverse Events 
 
This study will capture events reported following  the procedure and at follow up visits as 
reported by the PI and/or subject and from a review of medical records. The following device-related events  have been identified as possible risks from the procedure: 
 
• Allergic reaction to ECM  
• Bleeding 
• Calcification  
• Fever 
• Fibrosis 
• Hematoma  
• Infection 
• Inflammation  
• Seroma 
• Undesired remodeling 
 There are no identified risks involved in participating in this post- market study.  
11. Data Analysis    
The primary endpoints are as follows : 
   1. The proportion of subjects with CanGaroo ECM related adverse events.    2. The incidence of major pocket infection. 
 Point estimates and exact 95% binomial confidence intervals will be provided for the true (population) values of these two endpoints.   The number and percentage of subjects with AEs and with device- related AEs will be 
presented by type of AE.   
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            14 
 If possible, the rate of major pocket infection will be compared to the rate without use of 
the CanGaroo ECM device based on data from the U.S. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project family of databases and/or contemporary literature.  
 Similarly, if possible, the rate of other AEs will be compared by type  to the rate without 
use of the CanGaroo ECM device based on data from the U.S. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project family of databases and/or contemporary literature.  
  
12.  Ethical Considerations  
12.1 Code of Conduct  
 
The Investigator will ensure that the clinical study is conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and all regulatory and institutional requirements, including those for subject privacy, informed consent, Institutional Review Board or Ethics Commi ttee 
approval, and record retention.  (Appendix D :  Investigator Qualifications and 
Responsibilities)  
 Data quality will be monitored through review of submitted data to identify and follow up on missing data, inconsistent data, or incomplete data.  Critical data points such as adverse events or infection will be reviewed with the site via telephone and/or email and if required, on- site monitoring will be conducted.  All communication with the 
investigator and study staff related to monitoring and data collection will be documented per the Monitoring SOP.  Monitoring and related activities  will be performed by the 
Sponsor or its designee. 
    
12.2 Ethics Committee / Institutional Review Board Approval and Oversight  
 
The Investigator must obtain appropriate Ethics Committee (“EC”) or Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval before the study can be initiated .  The Sponsor will 
submit the protocol and i nformed consent to a centralized  IRB for approval.  If the 
Investigator chooses to use the centralized IRB , the Investigator will be responsible for 
completing the initial review form for the Sponsor to submit o n their behalf.  If the 
investigator chooses to us their own IRB, the sponsor will provide support for the compilation and submission of the IRB package.  A copy of the written approval from the EC/IRB and a copy of the approved Informed Consent Form (approved Waiver of Documentation of Consent, if applicable) should be sent to Aziyo .  Appropriate study 
progress reports will be prepared for the EC/IRB by the Principal Investigator. Any changes to the protocol must be discussed and approved by Aziyo  in writing unless the 
change is made to assure the safety of the subject.  In the non -emergent setting, after 
agreement on the changes has been reached, an amendment to the protocol will be provided by Aziyo  for submission to the EC/IRB for review and approval prior to 
initiation of the change.  Any change made emergently must be documented in the 
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            15 
 subject's medical record.  The Investigator must immediately forward to the EC/IRB any 
written safety reports or updates from Aziyo.    
12.3 Informed Consent and Subject C onfidentiality  
 
The Informed Consent/Waiver of Documentation of Consent and protocol must be approved by the local /centralized  EC/IRB before the study is initiated and subjects 
enrolled.  Prior to obtaining any study specific information approved informed consent 
will be reviewed with the subject and the subject must provide approval.  Documentation of the consent process must be completed by the research personnel.   The investigator 
shall provide a copy of the Informed Consent to the subject.  Completed documentation of the consent process will be available for auditing by  Aziyo or their representative , as 
applicable.    
  
 
Aziyo will maintain the confidentiality of the identity of subjects enrolled in the study 
and the information contained in their study r ecords.  Aziyo will also instruct the study 
investigators in the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of study records.  Any publication of any data collected as part of this trial will only use de -identified data, so 
that identification of any in dividual subject will not be possible.  The records will be 
made available as required for review by the FDA, or other applicable regulatory agency and a reviewing IRB; however to the extent possible, the subject’s identity will not be disclosed.  The Case Report Forms  will use a subject identification number, with the 
patient name and address NOT appearing anywhere on the study form to be submitted to the sponsor (Appendix E:  Sponsor’s Commitments).

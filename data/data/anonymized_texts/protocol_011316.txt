141. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS FO R STUDY 205715
Rationale
Despite av ailability  of treatments and published guidelines, patients may  have asthma 
that is inadequatel y controlled.  The prevalence of inadequatel y controlled asthma varies 
based on the definition used for control. In a sample of asthmatics visiting their 
healthc are provider for any  reason, 58% o f adult asthmatics were estimated to have 
uncontrolled asthma based on the Asthma Control Test (ACT, defined as an ACT score 
≤19).
The GINA guidelines recommend a long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA )as an 
add-on treatment option for adults with asthma that are currentl y taking medium to high 
dose inhaled corticosteroid/long -acting beta 2agonist ( ICS/LABA ) treatment and have a 
history  of exacerbations. Exacerbations are an important endpoint in asthma therap y; 
however, s ymptom control is also important in determining what patients could benefit 
from step -up therapy . Data from the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) PhIIb study  200699 
demonstrated that the LAMA Umeclidinium (UMEC), when added to the ICS f luticasone 
furoate (FF), reduced albuterol/salbutamol use and im proved sy mptoms in a sub -group of 
subjects with the primary diagnosis of asthma. 
GSK is currentl y developing a once -daily  ‘closed’ triple therap y of a n
ICS/LAMA/LABA co mbination [FF/UMEC /Vilanterol (VI)] in a single device, with the 
aim of providing a new treatment option for the management of asthma by improv ing
lung function, health -related quality  of life (HRQoL) and s ymptom control over 
established combination therapies. Through the comparison of a closed triple therap y to a 
standard of care ICS/L ABA c ombination therapy  this study  will provide important 
information to prescribers regarding the benefit of step -up to closed triple therap y to 
patients uncontrolled on ICS/LABA.

16Treatment A rms and Duration
As the duration of the treatment period is variable (see below for details), e ligible 
subjects will be requested to participa te in the study  for a minimum of approximately  32 
weeks and a maximum of approximately  60 weeks ( Visit 0to the Follow -up contact , 
inclusive )during which time, subjects will complete the following 5 phases of the study :
Pre-screening: Details about the study  and procedures will be explained 
through the informed consent process. The Pre -screening Visit ( Visit 0 )must be 
completed prior to initiating an y Visit 1 procedures .
Screening / run -in: Subjects who meet all the eligibility  criteria at Visit 1 
(Screening), will enter the run-in period for approximately  3week s in order to 
continue to assess the subj ect’s eligibilit y for the study . Subjects will take the 
last dose of their usual (i.e. pre -study ) ICS/LABA asthma medication 24hours 
prior to the Screening Visit .Subjects satisfy ing all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and who have successfully completed a ll protocol procedur es at screening will
be pr ovided with fixed dose I CS/LABA (fluticasone /salmeterol [FSC] , 250/50
mcg, via the DISKUS™ dry  powder inhaler [DPI ]) to take 1 inhalation twice a 
dayduring the 3-week run-in period, and rescue medication 
(albu terol/salbutamol) to use on an as -needed basis throughout the study .
Enrolment / stabilization: Subjects will self -administer their last dose of run -in 
FSC treatment on the morning prior to Visit 2 (i.e. 24hours prior to the 
Enrolment Visit ). At Visit 2 (the Enrolment Visit), subjects who meet all the 
eligibility  criteria will be pr ovided with fixed dose ICS/LABA 
(fluticasone /vilanterol [FF/VI ], 100/25mcg, via the ELLIPTA™ DPI ) to take 
once a day  during the 2 -week stabilization period. The 2 -week stabilization 
period is necessary  in order to allow subjects to become accustomed to using the 
ELLIPTA DPI (having used the DISKUS DPI during the run -in period) a s well 
as to continue to assess the subject’s eligibi lity for the study  and collect baseline 
eDiary  data.
Treatment: Subjects will self -administer their last dose of stabilization FF/VI 
treatment on the morning prior to Visit 3 (i.e. 24hours prior to the
Randomization Visit ). At Visit 3 (the Randomization Visit), subjects who meet 
all of the randomization criteria will be randomised 1:1:1:1:1:1 to one of the 
following six double -blind study  treatments:
FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg once dail y (QD)
FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 mcg QD
FF/UMEC/VI 100/ 31.25/25 mcg QD
FF/UMEC/VI 200/ 31.25/25 mcg QD
FF/V I 100/25 mcg QD
FF/V I 200/25 mcg QD
Study  treatment will be admin istered via the ELLIPTA DPI  in the morning.

17The duration of the treatment period is variable but will be a minimum of 24 
weeks and amaximum of 52 weeks. In accordance with the protocol -defined 
visit schedule, subjects will have up to 6 on -treatment clinic visits scheduled at 
Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8/End of Study  (EOS) (Weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52, 
respec tively).
The date that the whole study  will complete (henceforth referred to as the study  
completion date) will be determined based on the randomization date of the final 
subject in the study ; the study  completion date will be set at 181 day s (i.e. 25 
week s and 6 day s) post the fina l subject’s randomization date.
To determine when the final treatment/EOS visit will occur for each randomized 
subject in this variable duration study  (i.e. at Week 24, Week 36 or Week 52 of 
the treatment period), a date hencefor th referred to as the transition date will be 
communicated to the study  sites by  GSK . GSK will communicate aprovisional 
transition date to all study  sites on an ongoing basis during the stud y, until a 
fixed actual transition date is communicated at least 20 weeks in advance of the 
selected date (unless extenuating circumstances dictate otherwise). The date 
selected b y GSK as the actual transition date will always be more than 12 days 
prior to the study  completion date. At the Investigator’s discretion, sub jects 
should be informed of the transition date (provisional and actual) on an ongoing 
basis during the stud y so that their expected final treatment/EOS visit can be 
planned using the provisional transition date and then confirmed once the actual 
transitio n date is known.
Subjects who complete 52 weeks of stud y treatment prior to the actual transition 
date being communicated will have their final treatment/EOS visit at their Week 
52 clinic assessment visit.
After the actual transition date is communicated , subjects must adhere to their
study  visit schedule and complete a minimum of 24 weeks of stud y treatment. A 
subject’s final treatment/EOS visit will be defined as follows:
–Subjects whose Week 24 clinic assessment visit is scheduled to occur 
on or after the actual transition date (without consideration of available 
visit time -windows) will have their final treatment/EOS visit at their 
Week 24 clinic assessment visit. 
–Subjects who have their Week 24, Week 36 or Week 52 clinic 
assessment visit scheduled to oc cur before the actual transition date 
(without consideration of available visit time -windows) will have their 
final treatment/EOS visit at the clinic assessment visit that is scheduled 
to occur before but closest to the actual transition date (without 
consideration of available visit time -windows).
The subject’s final treatment/EOS visit must include all assessments specified 
for Visit 8/EOS .

18Safety follow -up: A safety  follow -up telephone contact or clinic visit will be 
conducted approximately 7 day s after the subject completes all of the protocol -
defined procedures for V isit 8 /EOS or, if ap plicable, the Earl y Withdrawal V isit. 
A subject will be considered to have completed the study  upon completion of al l 
assessments and procedures for Visit 8/EOS and inclu ding a successful follow -
up contact/visit .
Type and Number of Subjects
Patients with inadequately controlled asthma (i.e. patients with an ACQ -6 score ≥1.5) 
despite treatment with ma intenance asthma medication (>25 0 mcg/day  FP or equivalent 
plus L ABA).
The total number of randomized subjects required is approximately  2250, with 375 
subjects randomized to each of the 6double -blind treatment a rms.  Randomization will 
be stratified b y pre-study ICStreatment strength (mid, high) at screening to ensure 
treatment balance within each stratum.
Analysis
This is a superiority  study  to demonstrate the add -on benefit of UMEC at two dosage 
strengths 62.5 mcg and 31.25 mcg in a single inhaler when compared to FF/VI . For each 
test on each efficacy  endpoint, the null hy pothesis is that there is no difference between
treatment groups. The alternative h ypothesis is that there is a difference between 
treatment groups. The primary  efficacy  anal ysis for the primary  endpoint of change from 
baseline in trough FEV 1will evaluate the “de facto” ty pe estimand in the Intent -to-Treat 
population, using a mixed -model repeated measures (MMRM) anal ysis, including all 
trough FEV 1recorded post randomization.
2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Stud y Rationale
The Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines [ GINA2016 ]recommend a long -acting 
muscari nic antagonist (LAMA )as an add-on treatment option for adults (≥18 y ears) with 
asthma t hat are currently  taking medium -to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid and long -
acting beta 2agonist (ICS/LABA) maintenance therapy  and have a history  of 
exacerbations. Exacerbations are an important endpoint in asthma therap y; howeve r, 
symptom control is also important in determining what patients could benefit from step -
up therap y.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is currentl y developing a once -daily ‘closed’ triple therapy  of a 
ICS/LAMA/LABA co mbination [fluticasone furoate (FF)/umeclidinium 
(UMEC)/v ilanterol (VI)] in a single device, with the aim of providing a new treatment 
option for the management of asthma, by improv inglung function, symptom control and 
health -related quality  of life (HRQoL) over established combination therapies. Through
the comparison of a closed triple therap y to a standard of care ICS/LABA combination

19therap y this study will provide important information to prescribers regarding the benefit 
of step -up to closed triple therap y to patients uncontrolled on I CS/LABA.
2.2. Brief Background
Despite the availabilit y of treatments and published guidelines, patients may have asthma 
that is inadequatel y controlled.  The prevalence of inadequatel y controlled asthma varies 
based on the definition used for control. In a sample of asthmat ics visiting their 
healthcare provider for any  reason, 58% of adult asthmatics were estimated to have 
uncontrolled asthma based on the Asthma Control Test (ACT, defined as an ACT score 
≤19) [ Stanford 2010].
Consistent with these ob servations, an anal ysis of asthma patients in the United States 
(US) found that 29% -31% of asthma patients treated with high dose ICS/LABA therapy  
experienced exacerbations [ Schatz 2014].  I n a Dutch survey  of 929 patients treated wi th 
high dose ICS/LABA or medium/high dose ICS/LABA and maintenance oral 
corticosteroid ( OCS ), who self -reported asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease 
(COPD )with <10 smoking pack years, 74% of patients were classified as difficult to 
control (Ast hma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score >1.5, or experienced 
≥3exacerbations in a year, or ≥1 hospitalization in a y ear).  Half (50.6%) of these 
patients had an ACQ score >1.5, 21.7% had ≥3 exacerbations in a y ear, and 21.7% had 
≥1hospitalization in a y ear.  Based on this sample, an estimated 17.4% of the Dutch 
asthma population was estimated to be on high dose I CS/LABA or medium/high dose 
ICS/LABA and ma intenance OCS and have difficult to control asthma [ Hekking 2015].  
Although patients with asthma can be effectivel y treated with available controller 
medications, a subset of patients do not adequately respond to current standard therapy , 
as measured b y symptom questionnaires (ACT, ACQ) and exacerbations.
The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain asthma control and to reduce the 
future risk of exacerbat ions.  I CSsare considered the most effective anti -inflammatory  
treatments for all severities of persistent asthma [ National Institutes of Health ( NIH)
2007; GINA2016].  Treatment with I CS controls asthma sy mptoms, improves quality  of 
life and lung function, decreases airway  hyper-responsiveness, controls airway  
inflammation, and reduces the frequency  and severity  of asthma exacerba tions, thereby  
reducing asthma morbidity .  The dose of ICS is selected based on the severity  of the 
patient’s asthma.  In patients who are s ymptomatic on I CS alone, add -on therapy  with 
another controller, in particular a LABA is preferred to increasing the dose of I CS to 
achieve asthma control.  The addition of a LABA to an I CS improves s ymptom scores, 
decreases nocturnal asthma sy mptoms, improves lung function and reduces the number of 
asthma exacerbations [ Ducharme 2010].  Combina tion I CS/LABA inhalation products 
have been developed as a result of this need.  In difficult to treat persistent asthma, some 
patients continue to be s ymptomatic despite treatment with I CS and LABA combination 
medicati ons and the current guidelines [ GINA2016; NIH2007; British Thoracic Societ y 
/ Scottish I ntercollegiate Guidelines Network ( BTS/SIGN ) 2016] recommend treatment 
with high -dose inhaled or oral glucocorticosteroids in combination with LABAs and/or 
additional controller medications.

20In the E uropean Union (EU) , tiotropium bromide (LAMA) is licensed as an add -on 
maintenance bronchodilator treatment in adult patients with asthma who are currentl y 
treated with the maintenance comb inatio n of ICS ( ≥800 micrograms (mcg)
budesonide/day  or equivalent) and LABA and who experienced one or more severe 
exacerbations in the previous y ear [Spiriva Respimat Summary  of Product Characteristics 
(SPC) 2016 ].  In the US, tiotro pium bromide was recentl y approved for the maintenance 
treatment of asthma, in patients 12 years of age and older [ Spiriva Respimat United 
States Product I nsert ( USPI ), 2016 ].  The benefit of adding a LAMA to both I CS 
monotherap y and ICS/LABA fixed combination therap y was demonstrated in four Phase 
III confirmatory  studies (416, 417 [ Kerstjens 2012]; 418 and 419 [ Kerstjens 2015]), in 
symptomatic asthma patients ( ACQ score ≥1.5) .  The Phase III studies supporting the 
tiotropium application showed that addition of tiotropium bromide to I CS/LABA 
maintenance therap y significantly  improved lung function and reduced the risk of severe 
asthma exacerbation.

294.3. Type and Number of Subjects
Patients with inadequately controlled asthma (i.e. patients wi th an ACQ -6 score ≥1.5 
prior to enrolment at Visit 2) despite treatment with maintenance asthma medication.
The total number of randomized subjects required is approximately  2250 , with 375
subjects randomized to each of the 6double -blind treatment arms (to ensure 
approximately  337 evaluable subjects per treatment arm; see Section 9.2.1 ).  
Randomization will be stratified b y pre-study  ICStreatment strength (mid, high) at 
screening to ensure treatment balance within each stratu m.
4.4. Design Justification
This study  will use a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, parallel -
group design. This is a well -established design to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y ofan 
investigational drug.  A placebo arm is not include d as it is not considered appropriate for 
patients with inadequately  controlled asthma despite maintenance therapy . In addition, 
the comparison of interest is FF/UMEC/VI versus FF/VI for each UMEC dose . 
FF/UMEC and UMEC/VI treatment arms are not included a s these are not fixed dose 
combinations that are currently  available for asthma patients.
The aim of the stud y is to evaluate if patients with inadequatel y controlled asthma, 
despite treatment with ICS/LABA, can benefit from a once -daily  fixed dose combina tion 
of FF/UMEC/VI.  Eligible subjects must have the clinical need for dail y asthma 
maintenance therap y, namely  ICS/LABA, for at least 12 weeks prior to S creening.  
Subjects are required to wash -out their current asthma maintenance th erapy and switch to 
FSC(250/50mcg twice daily ) treatment , administered via the DI SKUS DPI , during the 
3-week run -in period.  The 3 -week run -in period is necessary  to standardize asthma 
maintenance therap y in all patients prior to the baseline collection period (i.e. the 
stabi lization period) . Subjects will take their last dose of FSC the morning prior to the 
Enrolment Visit (i.e. 24 hours prior to Visit 2). At Visit 2, all eligible subjects will be 
enrolled into the study  to receive FF/VI ( 100/25 mcg QD ) for 2 weeks during t he 
stabilization period; at Visit 3 eligible subjects will be randomised to receive one of the 
possible six double -blind study  treatments during the treatment period. The 2 -week 
stabilization period is necessary  in order to establish baseline s ymptoms for all subjects, 
on the same once -daily maintenance therap y, as well as to allow subjects to become 
accustomed to using the ELLIPTA DPI (having previously  used the DISKUS DPI  during 
the run -in period). S ubjects will take their last dose of stabilization perio dFF/V I
treatment the morning prior to commencing double -blind study  treatment at Visit 3 (i.e. 
24 hours prior to the Randomization Visit) .
As this is not primarily  a severe asthma exacerbation study , up to 52 weeks of data will 
be sufficient to demonstr ate a robust and persistent treatment effect for a bronchodilator. 
A minimum treatment period of 24 weeks is considered to be of adequate duration in 
order to assess the efficacy  of FF/UMEC/VI, compared to FF/VI, in terms of lung 
function and other effica cy endpoints.  To allow evaluation of the effect of FF/UMEC/VI 
on non-lung function endpoints, including moderate/severe exacerbations, the data from 
the two FF/UMEC/VI arms for each fixed UMEC dose will be pooled and compared to 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
30pooled data from the two F F/VI arms. The integrated anal yses will provide a more 
precise overall estimate for the treatment effect size of the addition of UMEC to FF/VI 
and also allows us to determine the effect of adding UMEC to the current standard of care 
(which could be FF100/V I or FF200/VI). In this instance, po oling is considered similar to 
respiratory  studies evaluating the effect of one medication in a separate inhaler added to 
the patient’s existing therapy  approach which isn’t standardized.
A treatment period of up to 52 w eeks is considered to be of suitable duration to collect 
asthma exacerbation data as well as to assess the safet y of FF/UMEC/ VI(given the 
extensive studies conducted in the mono -and dual -therap y programs for FF, UMEC, 
FF/V I, and UMEC/VI ).
4.5. Dose Justificat ion
The FF/UMEC/VI ( 100/31.25/25, 100/62.5/25 , 200/31.25/25 and 200/62.5/25 mcg) doses 
were selected based on the doses licensed b y the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )
and the European Medicines Agency  (EMA )for FF/VI for the treatment of asthma, and 
data from GSK Phase IIb study  200699, a dose -ranging stud y that evaluated four doses of 
umeclidinium in combination with fluticasone furoate (100 mcg) over a 4 -week treatment 
period, in reversible subjects with fixed airway  obstruction.  The primary  endpoint was 
the change from baseline in trough FEV 1. 
The 200699 data showed UMEC 62.5 mcg to be an effective dose; after 4 weeks of 
treatment in patients with a primary  diagnosis of asthma, an increase in trough FEV 1of 
136ml (milliliters) was observed in those subjects treated with FF/UMEC (100/62.5 mcg) 
compared to those subjects treated with FF (100 mcg) alone. However, study  200699 did 
not assess the UMEC 31.25 mcg dose, therefore, the efficacy  and safet y profile of this 
dose will be assessed in this study . No safety  signal was identified with any  of the UMEC 
doses (15.6, 62.5, 125 and 250 mcg) evaluated in the 200699 study .
4.6. Benefit: Risk Assessment

Cardiovascular effects of 
UMEC and VIUMEC
Cardiovascular effects are a potential class effect associated with anti -
muscarinic therapies.
In the UMEC/VI clinical development program in Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )patients, UMEC/VI was generally well tolerated. 
Overall, a low number of atrial arrhythmias were reported based on 12 -lead 
ECGs, Holter ECGs, or AEs, of which some occurred with a higher incidence 
in active treatment groups compared to placebo.  There was no additive 
effect with the combination over individual components.  Few of these 
findings were reported as Serious Adverse Events (SAEs )and none were 
fatal. In a narrow* Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) analysis, the 
incidence of non -fatal myocardial infarction ( Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) Preferred Terms (PTs)of myocardial 
infarction and acute myocardial infarctio n) was low (<1%) across all 
treatment groups, although small imbalances in exposure adjusted frequency 
were observed between UMEC -and VI containing treatment groups when 
compared with placebo and tiotropium.  There was no obvious dose 
relationship or addi tive effect from the combination.  Whether this represents 
a true effect is difficult to determine due to the small numbers. During clinical 
studies in COPD (62.5 and 125mcg daily dose of UMEC) and in Healthy 
Volunteers (in the Thorough QT study, UMEC 500m cg daily dose), no effect 
was observed on heart rate, blood pressure or QT.Mitigation strategy for UMEC and VI:
-Exclusion criteria as specified in Section 
5.2of the protocol
-Collection of cardiovascular risk factors 
and medical history at baseline
-ECGs as per schedul e in Section 7.1.
-Vital sign assessments (heart rate and 
blood pressure) as per schedule in 
Section 7.1.
-Cardiovascular AEs and Serious AEs 
(SAEs) will be captured on the electronic 
Case Repor t Form ( eCRF ) (see Section 
12.4.3 )

VI
In the FF/VI clinical development program in patients with COPD, the 
cardiovascular safety profile of VI and FF/VI was broadly consistent with the 
known pharmacology of LABAs i n patients with COPD. VI at doses up to 
100mcg in healthy subjects and subjects with asthma or COPD was not 
consistently associated with clinically relevant or statistically significant 
effects on blood pressure after either single or repeat dose administr ation. 
Data from Thorough QT (TQT) studies with FF, FF/VI and UMEC/VI suggest 
that, at the doses to be used in phase III studies, the closed triple 
(FF/UMEC/VI) is unlikely to cause clinically relevant effects on QTc1. No 
difference in QTcF2was observed between UMEC/VI 125/25mcg or UMEC 
500mcg and placebo. UMEC/VI 500/100mcg increased QTcF on average by 
8.2msec (milliseconds) (90% Confidence Intervals ( CI): 6.2, 10.2) at 30 
minutes (min) only. A lack of effect was demonstrated for QTcF with FF/VI 
200/25m cg (for 7 days). At a supratherapeutic dose of FF/VI (800/100mcg 
for 7 days), the largest mean time -matched difference from placebo was 9.6 
msec (90% CI: 7.2, 12.0) at 30 min only.

UMEC; those observed included dry mouth, constipation and cough.   Based 
on post -marketi ng experience dysgeusia has been added as an Adverse 
Drug Reaction (ADR) for inhaled UMEC and UMEC/VI.

Systemic ICS effects
-Adrenal suppression
-Cataracts & glaucoma
-Reduced bone mineral 
density and associated 
fracturesNo studies have shown a clini cally relevant effect of FF/VI or FF on the 
hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA). This includes a formal HPA study 
(HZA106851), which assessed the effects of FF/VI 100/25 and 200/25 on 
serum cortisol and 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion, and multiple studie s 
with COPD and asthma subjects which monitored urinary cortisol.  
During clinical development of FF & FF/VI no events of Adrenal Suppression 
were reported.  There has been no evidence for adrenal suppression based 
on post -marketing experience to date.  
In study HZA106839 (FF/VI, FF and fluticasone propionate ( FP)in subjects 
with asthma), formal Ophthalmic assessments were conducted (including 
Lens Opacities Classification System III ( LOCS III )evaluations for ocular 
opacities) throughout the study. Th is study showed no apparent effects on 
lens opacification, compared to baseline assessment.  
During studies in both subjects with asthma and COPD, no associated affect 
on ocular disorders was observed.  Spontaneous data received to date does 
not alter th e understanding of this risk.  
A decrease in bone mineral density and the risk of fractures is a class 
concern for any ICS -containing product for the treatment of COPD.
In two replicate 12 month studies in the FF/VI clinical program, in a total of 
3,255 patients with COPD, the incidence of bone fractures overall was low in 
all treatment groups, with a higher incidence in all FF/VI groups (2%)

fractures in the FF/VI groups compared with the VI 25 mcg group, fractures 
typically associated with corticosteroid use (e.g., spinal 
compression/thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, hip and acetabular fractures) 
occurred in <1% of the FF/VI and VI treatment arms.  In an integrated 
analysis of 11 studies in asthma with FF/VI (7,034 patients) and 10 studies in 
asthma with FF (6,219), the incidence of fractures with FF/VI and FF was 
1%, and usually associated with trauma.  
Pneumonia While ICS use is a recognised risk for pneumonia in patients with COPD.  A 
clear causal relationship between inhaled corticosteroid use and pneumonia 
in subjects with asthma has not been established.  
In an 18 study integration in the FF/VI as thma program, the incidence of 
pneumonia (adjusted for exposure) observed with FF/VI 100/25 and FF 100 
(8.5/1000 patient years and 9.6/1000 patient years, respectively) was similar 
to that seen with placebo (9.3/1000 patient years). A higher incidence in t he 
FF/VI 200/25 and FF 200 arms were observed (18.3/1000 patient years and 
23.6/1000 patient years, respectively). However, the 95% CIs were wide and 
overlapped across a ll treatment groups, including p lacebo .Few of the 
pneumonia events led to hospitalisat ion with either strength, and there were 
no observed differences in the incidence of serious events between the two 
treatment strengths.  The risk of pneumonia in asthma patients is very low 
and is consistent with the risk of other ICS.

37The risks for FF/VI and FSC are recognised pharmacological class effects associated with 
ICS and LABA t herap y.  The experience with these individual products is provided in the 
respective Investigator Brochures and/or product labelling.  Some of the experience with 
FF/V I is described in the table above, as this provides relevant background information 
for F F/UMEC/VI.
4.6.2. Benefit A ssessment
The addition of UMEC to FF/VI in asthma has the potential to improve lung function, 
reduce moderate/severe exacerbations and improve quality  of life in patients whose 
asthma is inadequatel y controlled on I CS/LABA alone.  Curre nt asthma treatment 
guidelines recommend the addition of a LAMA (tiotropium) for patients that are 
uncontrolled on I CS/LABA ( GINA2016 Steps 4 and 5); the availabilit y of the 
FF/UMEC/VI combination would therefore be consistent with th is approach.  The 
combination in a closed triple combination would provide the convenience of once dail y 
dosing and reduce the need for multiple inhalers.  Furthermore, the availability  of two 
doses of FF would allow the prescriber to select an appropriate inhaled corticosteroid 
dose based on the severity  of asthma.
4.6.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in the 
study , the potential risks identified in association with FF/UMEC/VI are justified by  the 
anticipated benefits that may  be afforded to subjects with asthma.  
The current experience with FF, UMEC and VI and the lack of significant safet y 
concerns relevant to the asthma population provides reassurance that the potential risks 
associated with the known pharmacology  of these compounds is offset by  the potential 
significant benefits that are afforded to patients inadequatel y controlled on ICS/LABA 
therap y.  
The I CS/LABAs used as run -in (FSC) and stabilization/comparator arms (FF/V I) are 
both marketed for the treatment of asthma and have favourable benefit -risk profiles.

5.5. Pre-Screening/Screening/Run -in Failure s
A subject will be assigned a subject number at the time the informed consent is signed.
The study  interactive response technology  (IRT) sy stem (RAMOS NG) will be contacted 
to report pre -screen failures. The following information will be collected in the eCRF for 
subjects who are pre -screen failures:
Date of informed consent form (ICF) signature
Demographic information including race, age and gender
Subject number
Serious Adverse Event information only for any  SAE considered as related to 
study  participati on
Investigator signature page
For the purposes of this study  pre-screen failures, screening failures, run -in failures and 
stabilization failures will be defined as follows:
Pre-screening failures: those subjects that sign the informed consent document 
butdo not have a Visit 1 (Screening) procedure.
Screening failures: those subjects that complete at least one Visit 1 (Screening) 
procedure but do not enter the run -in period. 
A subject who completes Visit 1 assessments and is dispensed the study  
medication for the run -in period is considered to have entered the run -in period.
Run-in failures: those subjects that enter the run -in period but do not 
subsequently  enter the stabilization period.
Any subject who completes the run -in period and then meets the elig ibility  
criteria and is dispensed the stabilization period study  medication at Visit 2 is 
considered to have entered the stabilization period.
Stabilization failures: those enrolled subjects that enter the stabilization period 
but are not subsequentl y randomised at Visit 3.
RAMOS NG will be contacted to report pre-screening, screening, run -in and stabilization 
failures.
In order to ensure transparent reporting of screen /run-infailure subjects, meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) p ublishing requirements, and 
respond to queries from Regulatory  authorities, a minimal set of screen /run-
in/stabilization failure information is required including demography , screen /run-
in/stabilization failure details, eligibility  criteri a, and any  SAE s(see Sectio n 7.5.1.7 and 
Appendix 4 ). Further details are provided in the study -specific eCRF completion 
guidelines document .
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
46Re-screening of subjects will be permitted; however, advance written approval to proceed 
with re -screening a subject must be obtained from the Medical Monitor (for conta ct 
details, see the medical monitor/Sponsor I nformation Page at the beginning of this 
protocol ).
5.6. Withdrawal/Stopping Criteria
5.6.1. Withdrawal from Study  Treatment
Subjects who withdraw from double -blind study  treatment prematurel y (for an y reason) 
should, where possible, continue to be followed -up as per protocol until the completion 
of the Safet y Follow -up assessments (Section 7.1; refer to the SRM for further details ). If 
this is not possible, the Investigator must encourage the subject to participate in as much 
of the study  as they  are willing (or able) to.
A subject may be withdrawn from stud y treatment at any time. A reason for premature 
discontinuation of study  treatment (e.g., AE, lack of efficacy [including acute moderate 
or severe asthma exacerbation] , protocol deviation, Investigator discretion, consent 
withdrawn etc.) must be captured in the eCRF.
A subject must be withdrawn from stud y treatment if any  of the following stopping 
criteria are met: 
Liver Chemistry : Meets any  of the protocol -defined liver chemistry  stopping criteria 
(see Section 5.6.3 and Appendix 2 )
QTc: Meets an y of the pr otocol -defined stopping criteria (see Section 5.6.4 )
Pregnancy : Positive pregnancy  test (see Section 7.5.3 and Appendix 5 )
5.6.2. Withdrawal from the Study
A subject may  withdraw from the study  at any  time at his/her own request; if a subject 
withdraws from the study , he/she may  request destruction of any  samples taken, and the 
Investigator must document this in the site study  records .
A reason for the withdrawal from the study  must b e captured in the eCRF.
The following actions must be taken in relation to a subject who fails to attend the clinic 
for a required stud y visit:
The site must attempt to contact the subject and re -schedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible. 
The site mus t counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study . 
In cases where the subject is deemed ‘lost to follow up’, the Investigator or 
design ee must make every  effort to regain contact with the subject (where 
possible, 3 telephone calls and if necessary  a certified letter to the subject’s last 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
47known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts 
should be documented in the subject’s medical record. 
Should the subject continue to be unreachable, only then will he/she be considered 
to have withdrawn from the study  with a primary  reason of “Lost to Follow -up”.
In the event of earl y withdrawal from the study, every  effort shou ld be made to have the 
subject to return to the clinic for an Earl y Withdrawal Visit and Safet y Follow -up,and to 
return all study  related materials. Assessments to be performed during the Earl y 
Withdrawal Visit and the Safety Follow -up contact are describ ed in the Time and Events 
table (Section 7.1).
5.6.3. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria
Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to 
assure subject safet y and evaluate liver event etiology (in align ment with the FDA 
premarketing clinical liver safety  guidance). 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guid
ances/UCM174090.pdf
Liver chemistry  stopping criteria 1 -5 are defined in Appendix 2 .
5.6.3.1. Study  Treatment Restart or Rechallenge
Study  treatment restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry  stopping criteria are met by  
any subject participating in this study  is not allowed.
5.6.4. QTc Stopping Criteria
Details on performing ECG assessments can be found in S ection 7.5.6 .
The QT interval corrected for heart rate b y Fredericia’s formula (QTcF) must be 
used for each individual subject to determine eligibility  for and discontinuation 
from the study .  This formula may  not be changed or substituted for the duration 
of the study .
QTcF must continue to be used for allsubject sfor all QTc data being collected 
for data analysis .  Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an 
exception.  
The QTc Fshould be based on single or aver aged QTc Fvalues of triplicate 
electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5-10 minute) recording period.
For this study , the following QTc stopping criteria will apply :
QTcF>500 msec or uncorrected QT>600 msec
Bundle branch block: QTcF 530 msec
Chang e from baseline: QTcF> 60msec

485.7. Subject and Study  Completion
The date that the whole study  will complete (henceforth referred to as the study  
completion date) will be determined based on the randomization date of the final subject 
in the study ; the study  com pletion date will be set at 181 day s (i.e. 25 weeks and 6 day s) 
post the final subject’s randomization date. 
To determine when the final treatment/EOS visit will occur for each randomized subject 
in this variable duration study  (i.e. at Week 24, Week 36 o r Week 52 of the treatment 
period), a date henceforth referred to as the transition date will be communicated to the 
study  sites by  GSK . GSK will communicate aprovisional transition date to all study  sites 
on an ongoing basis during the stud y, until a fix ed actual transition date is communicated 
at least 20 weeks in advance of the selected date (unless extenuating circumstances 
dictate otherwise). The date selected by  GSK as the actual transition date will alway s be 
more than 12 day s prior to the study  com pletion date. At the Investigator’s discretion, 
subjects should be informed of the transition date (provisional and actual) on an ongoing 
basis during the stud y so that their expected final treatment/EOS visit can be planned 
using the provisional transitio n date and then confirmed once the actual transition date is 
known.
Subjects who complete 52 weeks of stud y treatment prior to the actual transition date 
being communicated will have their final treatment/EOS visit at their Week 52 clinic 
assessment visit.
After the actual transition date is communicated , subjects must adhere to their study  visit 
schedule and complete a minimum of 24 weeks of study  treatment. A subject’s final 
treatment/EOS visit will be defined as follows:
–Subjects whose Week 24 clinic ass essment visit is scheduled to occur 
on or after the actual transition date (without consideration of available 
visit time -windows) will have their final treatment/EOS visit at their 
Week 24 clinic assessment visit. 
–Subjects who have their Week 24, Week 36 or Week 52 clinic 
assessment visit scheduled to occur before the actual transition date 
(without consideration of available visit time -windows) will have their 
final treatment/EOS visit at the clinic assessment visit that is scheduled 
to occur before but closest to the actual transition date (without 
consideration of available visit time -windows).
The subject’s final treatment/EOS visit must include all assessments specified for 
Visit 8/EOS .
A safet y follow -up telephone contact or clinic visit will be cond ucted approximately  
7days after the subject completes all of the protocol -defined procedures for Visit 8 /EOS 
or, if ap plicable, the Early  Withdrawal V isit. A subject will be considered to have 
completed the study  upon completion of al l assessments and pro cedures for Visit 8/EOS
and including a successful follow -up contact/visit .

6.1. Investigational Product and Other Study  Treatment
The term ‘stud y treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe an y combination 
of products received b y thesubject as per the protocol design. Stud y treatment may 
therefore refer to the individual study  treatments or the combination of those study  
treatments.
The DISKUSdevice w ill be used during the 3 -week run -in period of the study .  The 
DISKUS is a plastic inhalation del ivery  system containing a single -foil blister strip of a 
powder formulation of FSC intended for oral inhalation o nly.  Each blister on the single -
foil strip within the device contains 250 mcg of microfine FP and 72.5 mcg of microfine 
salmeter ol xinafoate salt, equivalent to 50 mcg of salmeterol base, in 12.5 mg of

51At Visit 3, the stabilization period ELLIPTA device will be collected from all subjects 
and an ELLIPTA device containing one of the double -blind study  treatments (see Section 
6.2) will be provided; subjects will self -administer their first dose of double -blind study  
treatment in the clinic during Visit 3 and will continue to administer double -blind study  
treatment at approximately  the same time each morning for the duration of the treatment 
period .Subjects will take their last dose of study  treatment in the clinic during Visit 
8/EOS (or at the Earl y Withdrawal V isit, if applicable) and a safet y follo w-up will be 
conducted approximately one week later.
On the mo rning of all study  clinic v isits after Visit 1 (i.e. the day  of Visit 2 onwards) , 
subjects will refrain from taking their morning dose of study  treatment until instructed to 
do so by clinic personnel.
Albuterol/salbutamol via metered -dose inhaler (MDI) will be issued for reversibility  
testing at Visit 1.  An albuterol/salbutamol MDI  for as needed (prn) use throughout the 
study  will be provided starting at Visit 1; at the I nvestigator’s discretion, more than one 
MDI  may  be provided at any  one time. Albuterol /salbutamol will be sourced from local 
commercial stock.  If not available locall y, GSK will source centrally. The contents of the 
label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements .
Ipratropium via MDI will be issued for reversibility testing at Visit 2 .Ipratropium will be 
sourced from local commerc ial stock. The contents of the label will be in accordance 
with all applicable regulatory  requirements .
At the I nvestigator’s discretion, provision will be made from Visit 11onwards for 
subjects to temporaril y receive inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP )to treat the sy mptoms 
of a moderate asthma exacerbation (see Section 6.9.1.1 and Section 7.3.6.1 ). Treatment 
start and stop dates wi ll be recorded in the eCRF .1Note: Should the subject use the provided FP prior to rand omization at Visit 3, the 
enrolment or randomization concomitant medication exclusion criteria would be met (see 
Section 5.3.2 andSection 5.4.2 ).
FP will be sourced from local commercial stock; i f not available locall y, GSK will source 
centrall y. The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory  
require ments . A record of the number of FP-containing inhaler s dispensed to each subject 
must be maintained and reconciled with study  treatment records.
Under normal conditions of handling and administ ration, study  treatment is not expected 
to pose significant sa fety risks to site staff.  Take adequate precautions to avoid direct ey e 
or skin contact and the generation of aerosols or mists. Notify  the monitor of any  
unintentional occupational exposure.  A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) describing 
the occupationa l hazards and recommended handling precautions will be provided to site 
staff if required b y local laws or will otherwise be available from GSK upon request.
Study  treatment must be stored in a secure area under the appropriate ph ysical conditions

country  medical department or third -party vendor.  Detailed instructions for the return of 
the study drug can be found in the SR M.
Ifany DISKUS or ELLIPTA fails to function proper ly, the subject should return to the 
clinic as soon as possible to obtain a new inhaler.  The site will use the I RT sy stem 
(RAMOS NG) to obtain a new treatment pack number for the subject and dispense a new 
study  treatment kit from the site’s study  treatme nt supply  as instructed b ythe IRT 
system .
In addition, any  DPI or MDI that fails to function properl y must be identified and 
returned to GSK for testing.  Details of the failure will be documented in the eCRF.
6.2. Treatment A ssignment
Subjects will be assigne d to study  treatment in acc ordance with the randomiz ation 
schedule. The randomization code will be generated by  GSK using a validated 
computerized sy stem. Subjects will be randomized using an I RT s ystem (RAMOS NG). 
The study  will use central -based randomiz ation to allocate treatments (see Appendix 7for 
country -specific requirements) . Once a randomization number is assigned to a subject it 
cannot be reassigned to any  other subject in the study .
Following the 2 -week stabilization period and subject to satisfy ing all eligibility  criteria, 
subjects willbe stratified by pre-study  ICStreatment dosage strength (mid, high) at 
screening and randomized 1:1:1:1 :1:1 to one of the followi ng six double -blind treatments 
for the duration of the treat ment period : 
FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg QD
FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 mcg QD
FF/UMEC/VI 100/ 31.25 /25 mcg QD
FF/UMEC/VI 200/31.25/25 mcg QD
FF/V I 100/25 mcg QD
FF/V I 200/25 mcg QD
The duration of double -blind treatment for each subject is a minimum of 2 4 weeks and a 
maximum of 52 weeks (see Section 4.2); on the morning of each scheduled clinic study
visit, subjects will refrain from taking their morning dose of study  treatment until 
instructed to do so by  clinic personnel. Study  treatment will be taken at the clinic at 
approximately  the s ame time of day  as taken at the Enrolment Visit (Visit 2 ). On the 
other day s during the treatment period (i.e. “non -clinic days”), subjects will be instructed 
to take their study  treatment each morni ng at approximately  the same time. Each 
Investigator will be provided with sufficient supplies to conduct the trial. Additional 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L

53treatment packs will be supplied as needed to the sites. Details of how to use the I RT 
system (RAMOS NG) to randomize subjects and manage study  treatment supplies 
(including dispensing) is prov ided in the RAMOS NG I RT manual and SR M.
6.3. Blinding
This will be a double -blind study  and the following will appl y. 
The Investigator or treating phy sician may  unblind a subject’s treatment 
assignment only in the case of an emergency OR in the event of a serious 
medical condition when knowledge of the stud y treatment is essential for the 
appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject as judged b y the 
Investigator . 
Investigator s have direct access to the subject’s individual study  treatment. 
It is preferred (but not required) that the Investigator first contacts the Medical 
Monitor or appropriate GSK study  personnel to discuss options before unblinding 
the subject’s treatment assignme nt. 
If GSK personnel are not contacted before the unblinding, the Investigator must 
notify  GSK as soon as possible after unblinding, but without revealing the 
treatment assignment of the unblinded subject, unless that information is 
important for the safe ty of subjects currently  in the study . 
The date and reason for the unblinding must be fully  documented in the eCRF 
GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the 
treatment assignment for any  subject with an SAE. If the SA E requires that an expedited 
regulatory  report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy  of the report, 
identify ing the subject’s treatment assignment, may  be sent to Investigator s in accordance 
with local regulations and/or GSK policy .Subjects w ill not be withdrawn from the study .
6.4. Packaging and Labeling
The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory  
requirements.
6.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability
Only  subjects enrolled in the study  may  receive study  treat ment and onl y 
authorized site staff may  supply  study  treatment.  All study  treatments must be 
stored in a secure environmentally  controlled and monitored (manual or 
automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access 
limited to t he Investigator and authorized site staff. 
The Investigator , institution, or the head of the medical institution (where 
applicable) is responsible for study  treatment accountability , reconciliation, and 
record maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation and final disposition records).  
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
54Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study  treatment 
are provided in the S RM. 
Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study  treatment is not 
expected to pose significant safet y risks to site staff .  Take adequate precautions to 
avoid direct ey e or skin contact and the generation of aerosols or mists. In the case 
of unintentional occupational exposure notify  the monitor, Medical Monitor 
and/or GSK study  contact.
A MSDS /equivalent doc ument describing occupational hazards and recommended 
handling precautions either will be provided to the Investigator , where this is 
required b y local laws, or is available upon request from GSK.
6.6. Compliance with Study  Treatment A dministration
When subject s are dosed at the study  site, they  will receive study  treatment under medical 
supervision.  The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in 
the eCRF .  The dose of study  treatment and study  subject identification will be confi rmed 
at the time of dosing b y a member of the stud y site staff. 
At scheduled clinic visits, s ubject comp liance with study  treatment administration since 
the previous scheduled clinic visit will be assessed by recording the number of doses 
remaining in the DISKUS or ELLIPTA, as applicable, in the eCRF (see the SRM for 
details), by  reviewing the eDiary  (see Section 7.3.5 ) and b y quer ying the subject, as 
necessary . Subjects should be 80% to 120% comp liant on taking study  treatme nt
between each pair of scheduled and consecutive on -treatment clinic visits. Subjects who 
fall outside this range should be re -educated on treatment compliance b y their site. This 
re-education should be documented in the subject’s source document. 
When s ubjects self -administer study  treatment(s) at home (i.e. not at the study  site) , 
compliance with study  treatment administration should be monitored by  the Investigator 
(or designee) b y reviewing the transmitted eDiary data via the vendor -provided portal 
(see Section 7.3.5 ); subjects should be immediately  contacted for re -education on 
treatment compliance if non -compliance (as assessed by  the Investigator or designee) is 
observed. This re -education should be documented in the sub ject’s source document.
A record of the number of DISKUSs and ELLIPTAs dispensed to each subject must be 
maintained and reconciled with study  treatment and compliance records.  Study  treatment 
start and stop date s will be recorded in the eCRF .
6.7. Treatment of Study  Treatment Overdose
An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described above which 
results in clinical signs and sy mptoms.  These should be recorded by  the Investigator on 
the AE/SAE pages.  In the event of an overdose of study  treatment , the Investigator
should use clinical judgment in treating the overdose and contact the GSK medical 
monitor.
GSK is not recommending specific treatment guidelines for overdose and toxicity  
management. The Investigator is advised to refer to the re levant document(s) for detailed 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
55information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other 
significant data pertaining to the stud y drug being used in this study . Such documents 
may include, but not be limited to, the IB or e quivalent document provided by  GSK .
6.8. Treatment after the End of the Study
Subjects will not receive any  additional treatment from GSK after completion of the 
study  because other treatment options are available .
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring t hat consideration has been given to the post -
study  care of the subject’s medical condition, whether or not GSK is providing specific 
post-study  treatment.
6.9. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies
All asthma medications used within approximately 6 wee ks prior to pre -screening (Visit 
0) and during the stud y (including the post -treatment period) should be recorded in the 
eCRF.
All non -asthma medications taken during the study  (after randomization including post -
treatment) and an y changes to concomitant m edications will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Note: Study provided albuterol/salbutamol and ipratropium should not be recorded in the 
eCRF ;however non -study supplied albuterol/salbutamo l or ipratropium will be recorded 
in the eCRF . The use of study provided an d non -study provided FP and additional 
asthma medications added temporarily for moderate asthma exacerbations will be 
recorded in the eCRF .
The minimum requirement is that the drug name, dose, route and the dates of 
administration are to be recorded.
Medi cations initiated after completion of the assessments at Visit 8/EOS or the Earl y 
Withdrawal Visit will not be recorded in the eCRF unless taken to treat an AE or asthma 
exacerbation. Detailed information of permitted and prohibited medications is included in 
the SR M for y our reference. Subjects who have completed the Early Withdrawal Visit
are allowed to use an y medications prescribed b y the Investigator or primary  care 
physician.
6.9.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies
6.9.1.1. Permitted A sthma Medications
In addition to study  treatment, t he following medications are permitted during this study :
Study -provided albuterol/salbutamol will be dispensed at Visit 1 for use as relief 
medication throughout the duration of the stud y. Subjects must be judged capable 
ofwithholding albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6hours prior to study  visits.
Systemic corticosteroids ( ≤5 milligrams (mg)/day  of prednisone [or an equivalent 
dose of an alternative s ystemic corticosteroid]) will be permitted provided that 
treatment was in itiated at least 12 weeks prior to Vi sit 1, remains stable for the 8 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
56weeks prior to Visit 1 and the subject remains in the maintenance phase (i.e., it is 
not weaned) throughout the study (the only  exception being the treatment of 
moderate/severe asthma exa cerbations [see below]).
Anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) (e.g. omalizumab) treatment will be permitted 
provided that treatment was initiated at least 16 weeks prior to Visit 1 and the 
subject remains in the maintenance phase throughout the study .
Anti-interleu kin (IL) -5 (e.g. mepolizumab) treatment will be permitted provided 
that treatment was initiated at least 16 weeks prior to Visit 1 and the subject 
remains in the maintenance phase throughout the study .
Temporary  additions in medications are permitted for t he treatment of moderate 
asthma exacerbations (see Section 7.3.6.1 ) at the Investigator’s/treating phy sician’s 
discretion. Asthma exacerbations should be treated in line with national and 
international recommendations and local medical standards. Asthma medications 
permitted on a temporary basis to treat a moderate asthma exacerbation include but are 
not limited to the following (the Medical Monitor may  be contacted for additional 
guidance, see the medical monitor/Sponsor I nform ation Page ):
An increase in ICS dose (including but not limited to the use of study -
provided FP which may  be used by  the subject at a total daily  dose deemed 
appropriate b y the Investigator/treating ph ysician).
Systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension or injection) for no more than 2 
days (or an increase in s ystemic corticosteroid dose for those subjects 
receiving maintenance s ystemic corticosteroids for no more than 2 days).
An Investigator -advised change in SABA use (i.e., routinely  scheduled versus 
as needed use).
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) and leukotriene modifiers.
Oral theoph ylline.
By definition, a severe asthma exacerbation will be treated with systemic 
corticosteroid (tablets, suspension or injection) for at least 3 consecutive da ys 
(or at least double the existing maintenance dose of sy stemic corticosteroid, if 
applicable, for at least 3 consecutive day s).See Section 7.3.6.2 .
6.9.1.2. Permitted Non -Asthma Medications
The following medications are permitted dur ing this study :
Medications for rhinitis (e.g., intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines [including 
ocular and intranasal], cromoly n, nedocromil, nasal decongestants)
Note: Use of these medications should be captured on the concomitant medication 
pages of the eCRF prior to ECG measurements.
Antibiotics for short term treatment of acute i nfections. L ong term treatment with 
topical or ophthalmic antibiotics are permitted.
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
57Decongestants :Subjects may  take decongestants during the study ,but these are 
disall owed for 24 hours prior to ECG measurements .
Immunotherap y: Immunotherap y for the treatment of allergies is allowed during 
the study  provided it was initiated 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 and subjects remain in 
the maintenance phase for the duration of the stu dy.
Topical and ophthalmic corticosteroids .
Systemic and ophthalmic beta -blockers: Administer with caution as s ystemic 
beta-blockers block the pulmonary  effect of beta -agonists and may  produce severe 
bronchospasm in patients with reversible obstructive air ways disease. 
Cardioselective beta -blockers should be considered, although they  also should be 
administered with caution.
Localized corticosteroid injections (e.g. intra -articular and epidural).
Tricy clic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (M AOIs). 
(Administer with extreme caution as they  may  potentiate the effects of beta -
agonists on the cardiovascular s ystem, including QTc prolongation)
Diuretics.  (Caution is advised in the co -administration of beta -agonists with non -
potassium sparing diure tics as this may  result in ECG changes and/or 
hypokalemia )
Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 )inhibitors (Caution should be exercised when 
considering the coadministration of long -term ketoconazole and other known 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clari thromy cin, conivaptan, indinavir, 
itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromy cin, 
troleandomy cin, voriconazole) because increased sy stemic corticosteroid and 
increased cardiovascular adverse effects may  occur )
Vaccinations (Infl uenza vaccine, Pneumonia vaccine, Shingles vaccine, etc.) 
(Administration of influenza and pneumonia vaccines should be considered based 
on clinical discretion of the Investigator and local/national guidelines. Current 
influenza vaccines and pneumonia vacc ines will be captured on the concomitant 
medication pages of the eCRF )
All medications for other disorders may  be continued throughout the study  provided their
use would not be expected to affect the subjects’ lung function or safety  assessments
(e.g., cardiac measurements). However , no sy stemic corticosteroids for other conditions 
will be permitted.
6.9.1.3. Permitted Non -Drug Therapies
Continuous Positive Airway  Pressure (CPAP) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 
is permitted if initiated at least 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and the 
subject continues CPAP treatment throughout the study .  This treatment must be captured 
in the eCRF.
6.9.2. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies

after taking the morning dose of study treatment. Rescue medication should b e withheld for at least 6 hours prior to the pre -dose spirometry assessments until after completion of 
the 3 -hour post -dose spirometry assessments. Pre -and post -dose spirometry assessments should be performed at the same time of day at each applicable vis it.
14. In the event that double -blind study treatment is not administered at this visit, spirometry assessments should be performed at the same time of day a s the pre -and post -dose 
spirometry assessments at the preceding on -treatment clinic visits.
15. Following completion of the pre -dose spirometry assessments, the reversibility test will be conducted between 20 and 60 minutes following 4 inhalations of al buterol/salbutamol 
aerosol. If airway reversibility is not demonstrated at Visit 1 then the assessment may b e repeated within 7 days of Visit 1 (see Section 7.3.4.1.1 for details of the criteria to be met 
before a repeat of the reversibility assessment is permitted). If airway reversibility is successfully demonstrate d at the second attempt and all other eligibility criteria assessed at 
Visit 1 are met then the subject may commence the 3 -week run -in period (starting on the date that airway reversibility was successfully demonstrated at the second attempt) .
16. Following co mpletion of the pre -dose spirometry assessments, the reversibility test will be conducted between 60 and 90 minutes following 4 inhalations of ip ratropium aerosol 
(see Section 7.3.4.1 )
17. The vital signs assessment will include the measurement of height and weight at this visit only.
18. At the Screening Visit (Visit 1), the ECG is to be obtained after the vital signs assessment but prior to performing the pre -bronchodilator spirometry assessment (see Section 
7.5.6 ). At all post -randomization visits the ECG is to be obtained 15 minutes to 45 minutes after the administration of study treatment.
19. Exhaled Nitric Oxide is widely accepted as a non -invasive marker for airway inflammation and will b e assessed to characterise the study subject population. Details on performing 
the FeNO assessment, including information on the equipment provided and its use, are documented in the SRM and the third -party vendor manual.
20. Pharmacogenetic sample may be draw n any time from Visit 3 onwards.
21. Assessments only to be conducted in females of reproductive potential.
22. Pharmacokinetic (PK) subset: In a subset of approximately 20 % of all randomized subjects, PK samples will be obtained at pre -dose on the visit day, and 1 sample in each of the 
following three time windows: 5min -30min, 45min -90min, and 2 -3h post dose on the visit day. NOTE: the date and time of study treatment administration on the day prior to the 
visit must be recorded in the eCRF. 
23. PK sample to be obtai ned at pre -dose on the visit day (This PK sample is to be obtained from ALL study subjects). NOTE: the date and time of study treatment administration on 
the day prior to the visit must be recorded in the eCRF.
24. PK sample to be obtained at this visit ONLY in the event that Visit 8/EOS assessments are conducted at Week 24.
25. In the event that the reversibility assessment needs to be repeated within 7 days of Visit 1 (see Section 7.3.4.1.1 ) then the medication for th e 3-week run -in period must not be 
dispensed until airway reversibility is successfully demonstrated at the second attempt and all other eligibility criteria as sessed at Visit 1 are confirmed as met.
26. Study treatment should be administered at the same time of day at each applicable clinic visit.

6727. The administration of study treatment at this visit is optional. If study treatment is not administered at this visit then those assessments which are scheduled based on the time of 
study treatment administration sho uld be performed at approximately the same time of day as performed at the preceding post -randomization visits.
28. Between scheduled visits, unscheduled visits to the study clinic to re -supply the subject with double -blind study treatment is permitted after V isit 3 but before Visit 8/EOS. The IRT 
will be used for study treatment supply management (Please refer to the RAMOS NG IRT manual and SRM for more information).
29. In the event that the subject attends the study clinic for the unscheduled dispensing of doubl e-blind study treatment, previously dispensed study treatment should be collected for 
drug accountability purposes.
30. FP may be used temporarily to treat the symptoms of a moderate asthma exacerbation, at the Investigator’s discretion. However, please note t hat a subject’s use of the provided 
FP prior to randomization at Visit 3 would meet the enrolment or randomization concomitant medication exclusion criteria (see Section 5.3.2 and Section 5.4.2 )

687.2. Screening and Critical Baseline A ssessments
No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form has 
been signed by the subject.  A Pre-Screening visit (Visit 0) is required in order to 
administer the informed consent before an y chan ges are made to the subject’s current 
medical regimen.  Selection and modification of the subject’s medications prior to study  
participation is based on the phy sician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, 
principles, and each subject’s needs.  A subject’s treatment must not be changed merel y 
for the purpose of enabling the subject’s participation in the stu dy.
During the Pre-Screening visit (V isit 0) the following information will be captured in the 
eCRF for each subject : 
Date of ICF signature

7.3.2. Efficacy  Assessments
The timings of all efficacy  assessments are documented in the Time and Events table (see 
Section 7.1).
7.3.3. Questionnaires
The questionnaires should be completed before any  procedures are performed on the 
subject to avoid influencing the subject’s response. To avoid biasing responses, the 
subjects should not be told the results of diagnostic tests prior to com pleting the 
questionnaires and i t is recommended that the questionnaires be administered at the same 
time of day  during each visit (as applicable) using the provided electronic device (unless 
otherwise specified) .  Adequate time must be allowed to complete all items on the 
questionnaires; the questionnaires must be reviewed for completeness and, if necessary , 
the subject must be encouraged to complete an y missing assessments or items.
Instructions for completing t he questionnaires can be found in the SRM.
7.3.3.1. Global A ssessment of Severity  and Response to Treatment
The subject will be asked to complete the Global Assessment of Severit y and Response to 
Treatment at the visits specified in the Time and Events table (Secti on 7.1). The Global 
Assessment of Severit y is a single item questionnaire; subjects are asked to rate their 
asthma sy mptoms at the study  visit using a five -point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, 
very severe).  The Response to Treatment is a single question of the patient’s overall 
evaluation of response to treatment, using a seven -point rating scale with the following 
definitions: 1 = significantly  improved; 2 = moderatel y improved; 3 = mildly  improved; 
4= no change; 5 = mildly worse; 6 = moderatel y worse; and 7 = significantly  worse. 
7.3.3.2. Asthma Control Questionnaire (A CQ)
The ACQ measures seven attributes of asthma control [ Junipe r1999].  Six attributes are 
measured with a patient -completed questionna ire, and the questions are designed to be 
self-completed b y the subject.  Subjects will complete the ACQ at specified study  visits.  
The six questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity  
limitation, shortness of breath, wheeze and rescue medication use) enquire about the 
frequency  and/or severit y of symptoms over the previous week.  The response options for 
all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ 
limitation) scale.  The recall p eriod is the past week.  The seventh attribute of the ACQ -7 
is lung function (FEV1% -predicted) which will be included via study  visit spirometry .   
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
72Two shortened versions of the ACQ exist.  The two shortened versions include the ACQ -
5 (a five -item measure using onl y the s ymptoms items) and the ACQ -6 (six -item 
measures and rescue bronchodilator use). The measurement properties were very  similar 
for all versions of the ACQ (original 7 -item ACQ and shortened versions) [ Juniper 2005; 
Wyrwich 2011].  For all versions, a score of 0.75 indicates well -controlled asthma and a 
score 1.5 indicates poorly  controlled asthma [ Juniper 2006].  A change of 0.5 in score 
suggests a clinically  important change in score [ Juniper 2005].
7.3.3.3. St. George’s Respiratory  Questionnaire (SGRQ)
The St. George’s Respiratory  Questionnaire is a well established instrument, comprising 
50 questions designed to measure Quality  of Life in patients with diseases of airway  
obstruction, measuring symptoms, impact, and activity . The questions are designed to be 
self-completed b y the subject [ Jones 1992] with a recall over the past 3 months .Higher 
scores indicate worse health status, a nd a change of 4 points is considered a clinically  
relevant change [ Jones 2005].
7.3.3.4. Asthma Quality  of Life Questionnaire (A QLQ)
The Asthma Qualit y of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) was developed to measure the 
functional impairments related t o asthma experienced b y adults 17+ years old.  The 
AQLQ (+12), is a modified version of the original AQLQ and validated for use in asthma 
patients between the ages of 12 and 70 [ Juniper 2005]. The response scale ran ges from 1 
(totally  impaired) to 7 (not at all impaired).  The questions are designed to be self -
completed b y the subject with a recall over the past 2 weeks.  Higher scores indicate 
better asthma -related HR -QoL, and a change of 0.5 is considered clinicall y important 
[Juniper 1994].
7.3.3.5. Healthcare Resource Utilization
All unscheduled asthma -related healthcare utilization will be recorded in the eCRF at the 
time points specified in the Time and Events table (Section 7.1). Unscheduled asthma -
related healthcare utilization includes telephone contacts, specialist nurse visits, visits to a 
physician’s office, home visits (day  and night time), outpatient visits, visits to urgent 
care, visits to the emergency  departm ent, and hospitalizations associated with the 
subject’s worsening of s ymptoms.  The Medical Problems/Medication Taken worksheet
(see Section 7.5.8 )used by  the subject to record all healthcare contacts experienced since 
the las t visit will be presented to the Investigator (or designee) at the clinic visits.  
Subjects will be asked to bring their worksheet to every  study  site visit as it will be used 
to assist subject recall in discussions with the Investigator , for site staff to then enter as 
appropriate in the eCRF.  The Investigator (or designee) should ask the subject if any  of 
the healthcare contacts that are recorded on the worksheet were due to a w orsening of 
asthma symptom s.  The Investigator can refer to his/her records t o verify  or supplement 
information given b y the subject, if necessary .
7.3.4. Pulmonary  Function Tests
Spirometry  will be performed at the study  site to assess FEV 1and FVC. At least 3 
acceptable spirometry  manoeuvres (from a maximum of 8 attempts) should be achi eved 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
73on each occasion that spirometry  assessments are performed, in accordance with the 
ATS/ERS standards [ Miller 2005]. The highest of 3 technicall y acceptable measurements 
will be recorded at each visit:
Pre-dose Sp irometry: At Visits 3 through 8/EOS (and the Early  Withdrawal 
Visit, if applicable) , subjects should withhold short -acting beta -2-agonists 
(SABAs) for 6 hours prior to the clinic visit, if possible. Spirometry  
assessments must be performed :
oBetween 6am a nd 11am on the day  of the visit.
oAt the same time of day  (1 hour) as the assessment performed at Visit 3 
(the baseline assessment).
oAt least 24 hours after the subject’s last morning dose of study  treatment 
on the day  prior to the visit.
oBefore the subje ct’s morning dose of stud y treatment on the day  of the 
visit.
Post-dose Spirometry: At Visits 3, 6 and 8/EOS (and the Early  Withdrawal 
Visit, if applicable), spirometry  assessments must be performed 3 hours after the 
subject’s morning dose of study  treatme nt; the assessment performed at Visits 6 
and 8/EOS should be performed at the same time of day  (1 hour) as the 
assessment performed at Visit 3(the baseline assessment). At each visit, s ubjects 
should withhold short -acting beta -2-agonists (SABAs) between receiving their 
morning dose of study  treatment and completing the spirometry  assessments , if 
possible .
Spirometry  equipment will be provided to all sites by  a third -party vendor; the same 
third -party vendor will also centrall y analyse the spirometry data from this study . Details 
on performing the spirometry  assessments, including information on the equipment 
provided and its use as well as specific instructions on performing the spirometry  
manoeuvres, are documented in the SRM and the third -party vendor m anual.
7.3.4.1. Reversibility
All reversibility  evaluations should follow the recommendations of the AT S/ERS Task 
force: Standardization of Lung Function Testing [ Miller 2005]. A pre-bronchodilator
spirometry  assessment should be performed after a washout period of at least 6 hours for 
short -acting β 2-agonist s.
Percent reversibility  will be calculated as follows:
(Post -bronchodilator FEV 1–Pre-bronchodilator FEV 1) x 100
Pre-bronchodilator FEV 1
7.3.4.1.1. Albuterol/Salbutamol
The reversi bility  requirement for eligibility  must be assessed at Visit 1. Subjects must 
demonstrate a 12% and 200 mL  increase in FEV 1to be eligible for the study .If these 
reversibility  criteria are not met at Visit 1 then the subject may  not enter the 3 -week run -
in period; however, the reversibility  assessment may  be repeated once within 7 day s of 
Visit 1 if either criteria a) or b) are met:
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
74a)≥9% increase in FEV 1between 20 and 60 minutes following 4 inhalations of 
albuterol/salbutamol aerosol at Visit 1.
b)Documented evidence of a reversibility  assessment within 1 y ear prior to Visit 1 
which demonstrated a post -bronchodilator increase in FEV 1 of≥12% and ≥200 
mL.
Should the subject successfully  demonstrate airway  reversibility  (defined as ≥12% and 
≥200 mL  increase in FEV 1between 20 and 60 minutes following 4 inhalations of 
albuterol/salbutamol aerosol) at the second attempt then, provided that a ll other eligibility  
criteria assessed at Visit 1 are met, the subject may  enter the 3 -week run -in period.
To perform the reversibility  assessment, 4 puffs of the provided salbutamol/albuterol is 
administered (aspace r device may  be used , if required ).Following completion of the pre-
bronchodilator assessment, a second spirometry  assessment is performed within 20 to 60
minutes after administration of the salbutamol/albuterol.
7.3.4.1.2. Ipratropium
At Visit 2, subjects will perform a reversibility  assessment using ipr atropium as the 
bronchodilator. As the aim of this assessment is to aid the characterisation of the study  
population, subjects are not required to demonstrate a 12% and 200 mL increase in 
FEV 1to ipratropium to be eligible for the stud y.
To perform the r eversibility  assessment, 4 puffs (approximately  80 mcg total) of the 
provided ipratropium is administered (aspace r device may  be used , if required ).
Following completion of the pre-bronchodilator assessment at Visit 2, a second 
spirometry  assessment is pe rformed within 60 to 90 minutes after administra tion of the 
ipratropium .
For a list of countries whose study  subjects may  not perform this assessment, please refer 
to the SRM.
7.3.5. Daily  Diaries
Subjects will be issued with a combination spirometer andeDiary  device at Visit 1 for 
twice daily use (in the morning upon waking and in the evening just before going to bed)
throughout the stud y. The eDiary  device will be provided by a third -party vendor . 
Information on the device and its use are documented in the SRM and the third -party 
vendor manual . Subjects will be instructed on how to use the device in order to record 
results for the following in the eDiary  each day from Visit 1 onwards :
Daily symptom assessment (E -RS and supplemental asthma items; night -time 
awake ning, asthma sy mptom and phy sical activity question s)
The n umber of inhalations of rescue albutero l/salbutamol used during the day and 
night.
Morning and evening FEV 1
Morning and Evening Peak Expiratory  Flow (PEF)
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L

75Morning and evening FSC medication use(during the run -in period onl y)
Morning FF/VI medication use (during the stabilization period only )
Morning double -blind study  medication use (during the treatment period only )
Section 7.3.5.1 describes the assessments and questio nnaires recorded on the eDiary  
device , as well as the alerts that can be triggered based on recorded results .The data from 
the eDiary  device will be automatically  transmitted to a centralised server on a daily  
basis. T he Investigator anddesignee (s) will be provided with access to the transmitted 
eDiary  data via a vendor -provided portal and should review the data on an ongoing basis 
to check for the incidence of alerts (see Section 7.3.5.1.6 ) as well as subject compliance 
with eDiary  use and study  treatment administration.
Subjects will also be issued with a paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken
worksheet to record medical problems experienced and medications used during the 
study (please refer to the SRM for further details) .Subjects must also use this paper 
worksheet to record all healthcare contacts that occur during their participation in the 
study . This paper worksheet will be used to assist subject recall in discussions with the 
Investigator , for site staff to then ente r as appropriate in the eCRF.
7.3.5.1. eDiary  Questionnaires, A ssessments and A lerts
For information on the eDiary  questions, please refer to Appendix 6 .
7.3.5.1.1. E-RS
The Evaluating Respiratory  Symptoms (E -RS) in COPD consists of 11 items from the 14 
item Exacerbations of COPD ( EXACT -PRO )instrument.  E -RS is intended to cap ture 
information related to respiratory  symptoms , i.e. breathlessness, cough, sputum 
production, chest congestion and chest tightness. The E -RS was developed for use in 
patients wit h COPD but symptom experience of patients with asthma may  be 
appropriatel y measured with the E -RS. The daily recording of information allows an 
assessment of the underlying day  to day  variability  of a patient's s ymptoms . The 
instrument is to be completed daily each night prior to going to bed .  The 11 -items are 
scored on a 5 -point scale of “not at all” to “extreme”.  The E -RS has a scoring range of 0 -
40.
7.3.5.1.2. Supplemental Asthma Items
To ensure that asthma s ymptoms are completel y evaluated, two additional quest ions will 
be asked.  A question on wheeze, a symptom of importance in asthma will also be asked 
within the context of the daily  diary . An item on breathlessness activities will evaluate 
shortness of breath associated with strenuous activities.  Subject s will be asked to respond 
to the question ‘Did y ou wheeze today ?’ with response options of: Not at all, Rarely , 
Occasionall y, Frequently, Almost constantly .  Subjects will be asked to respond to the 
question “Were you short of breath today when performing str enuous activities such 
climbing stairs, running, or participating in sports activity  with a response scale of not at 
all, slightly , moderatel y, severel y, extremely  or too breathless to do these.  
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
767.3.5.1.3. Night -time Awakening, Asthma Symptom and Physical Activity 
Questions
Every  morning upon waking (from the morning after Visit 1 onwards ), subjects will 
answer a question on the occurrence of night -time awakenings due to asthma sy mptoms. 
The subject’s response to the question on the occurrence of night -time awakenin gs will 
be either ‘Yes’ (i.e. Did y ou wake up due to asthma sy mptoms ( i.e. wheezing, coughing, 
shortness of breath, or chest tightness ) or ‘No’ (i.e. they  did not experience at least one 
night -time awakening due to asthma sy mptoms ). If ‘Yes’ ,subjects will be asked to 
respond either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to the question on rescue medication (i.e. when y ou woke up 
due to y our asthma s ymptoms did y ou use any  rescue bronchodilator?) .
On the evening of Visit 1 (just before going to bed) and every  evening there -after, 
subjects will answer a question on day time asthma sy mptoms and day time phy sical 
activity  limitation. These questions will be answered on a 5 -point scale (0 to 4) with ‘0’ 
representing no day time asthma s ymptoms/phy sical activity  limit ations and ‘4’ 
represen ting very  severe day time asthma sy mptoms or total day time activity  limitation.
(Please describe the severity  of your asthma s ymptoms today  (i.e. cough, wheeze, chest 
tightness, shortness of breath) today  [0=no asthma sy mptoms, 1=mild asthma sy mptoms, 
2= mo derate asthma s ymptoms, 3=severe asthma sy mptoms, 4= very  severe asthma 
symptoms. How limited were you in your a ctivities today  because of your asthma (0=not 
at all limited, 1=a little limited, 2=moderatel y limited, 3=severel y limited, 4=totally 
limited) .
7.3.5.1.4. Rescue Albuterol/Salbutamol Use
The number of puffs of albuterol/salbutamol self -administered b y the subject each day for
therelief of asthma symptoms will be recorded morning and evening in the eDiary .Upon 
awakening in the morning, subjects should recor d the number of puffs of 
albuterol/salbutamol taken since completing the eDiary  assessments on the evening of the 
previous day . Each evening, before going to bed, subjects should record the number of 
puffs of albuterol/salbutamol taken since completing the eDiary that morning (except on 
the day  of Visit 1 when the number of puffs of albuterol/salbutamol taken since being 
provided with the albuterol/salbutamol MDI  should be recorded). Subjects should be
instructed that study -provided albuterol/salbutamol should be used on an “as needed”
basis only .
Any use of non -study -provided rescue medication should be recorded as a concomitant 
medication in the eCRF. Use of study -provided rescue albutero l/salbutamol should not be 
recorded as a concomitant medication in the eCRF; however, the use of study -provided 
albuterol/salbutamol prior to exercise as a preventative measure should be recorded as a 
concomitant medication in the eCRF.
7.3.5.1.5. Morning and Evening Home Spirometry
An electronic home spirometer/eDiary  device will be issued to subjects at Visit 1 for 
daily  monitoring of their lung function (i.e. FEV 1and PEF) . The home Spirometer/eDiary  
device will be provided by a third -party vendor . Information on the device and its use are 
documented in the SRM an d the third -party vendor manual .Subjects will conduct 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
77spirometry  maneuvers each morning ,prior to study  medication dosing ,and each evening. 
Three measurements for each session will be performed by  the subjects using the 
spirometer/ eDiary device; the highest value from the three FEV 1and PEF measurements 
will be recorded. Assessments will be performed :
After completing all other eDiary  assessments
Prior to albuterol/salbutamol use
Prior to study  medication dosing
Data from the home FEV 1assessments will be used to determine the time to maximal 
effect of the assigned double -blind study  treatment.
7.3.5.1.6. Alerts
The following alerts for a change from baseline in asthma sy mptoms, lung function, 
and/or rescue medication use that may  indicate the onset of a moderate/severe asthma 
exacerba tion, will be programmed into the eDiary:
Nocturnal awakening(s) due to asthma requiring albuterol/salbutamol use for 2 
consecutive nights.
An increase of ≥1.0 (on a 5 -point scale) from baseline in day time asthma 
symptom score on 2 consecutive day s.
An increase from baseline of ≥ 4 puffs /day  of albuterol/salbutamol use on 2 
consecutive day s.
A ≥20% decrease in AM PEF from baseline on 2 consecutive mornings.
A ≥20% decrease in PM PEF from baseline on 2 consecutive evenings
A ≥20% decrease in AM FEV1 from baseline on 2 consecutive mornings.
A ≥20% decrease in PM FEV1 from baseline on 2 consecutive evenings.
The baseline value, for the purpose of alerts, is def ined as the average value over the last 
7 day s prior to randomization. Subjects will be instructed to contact the Investigator if 
any of the above alert criteria are met (either by  telephone and/or b y visiting the stud y 
clinic) .
The data from the home spir ometer/eDiary  device will be automatically  transmitted to a 
centralised server on a daily  basis. T he Investigator anddesignee (s) will be provided with 
access to the transmitted eDiary  data via a vendor -provided portal and should review the 
data on an ongo ing basis to check for the incidence of alerts as well as subject 
compliance with eDiary  use. The Investigator or designee (s) is instructed to evaluate 
subjects who meet eDiary  alert criteria for signs or sy mptoms of an asthma exacerbation 
and to provide a ppropriate medical care ( see Section 7.3.6 ).
7.3.6. Asthma Exacerbations
For the purposes of this study , moderate/severe asthma exacerbations will be collected 
and recorded on the asthma exacerbation eCRF page from the start of random ized double 
blinded treatment until Visit 8/EOS Visit or the Early Withdrawal Visit for those subjects 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
78that withdraw from participation in the study  (see Section 5.6). Moderate/severe asthma 
exacerbations should not be recorded as an adverse event unless:
They  meet the definition of an Adverse Event (see Appendix 4 ) and occur: 
oAfter the start of study  treatment until the start of double blinded study  
treatment or;
oAfter completion of the Visit 8/EOS Visit (or Early Withdrawal Visit) 
assessments until the follow -up contact.
OR
They  meet the definition of a Serious Adverse Event (see Appendix 4 ).
Note : The SAE page of the eCRF should be completed in addition to the asthma 
exacerbation eC RF page if the exacerbation occurs after the start of double 
blinded treatment but before completion of the Visit 8/EOS Visit or Early 
Withdrawal Visit assessments.
For con sistency , exacerbations separated b y less than 7 day s will be treated as a 
continuat ion of the same exacerbation.
Alerts will be programmed into the eDiary  to instruct the subject to contact the 
Investigator immediatel y for a medical assessment (see Section 7.3.5.1.6 ).The 
notification of decreasing asthma co ntrol from the eDiary  will assist the Investigator in 
the identification of new asthma exacerbations.
Subjects will also complete a paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet to 
record medical problems experienced and medications used during the st udy, as well as 
all emergency  department visits and/or hospitalizations that occur during their 
participation in the study . This paper worksheet must be reviewed by  the Investigator (or 
designee) at each visit to the study  site to assist the Investigator in the identification of 
new asthma exacerbations.
All moderate/severe asthma exacerbations will be recorded in the eCRF b y the 
Investigator (or designee).
7.3.6.1. Moderate A sthma Exacerbation
All eDiary  alerts will be evaluated b y the Investigator (or appropriatel y trained designee). 
The Investigator will utilize clinical discretion and available objective evidence 
(including eDiary  data) to determine if the patient is experiencing a moderate asthma 
exacerbation.  Examples of key  considerations include subject’s pa st medical history , 
severit y and duration of current s ymptoms, and known asthma triggers. Guidance for 
identify ing moderate exacerbations includes the following [ Reddel 2009, Virchow 2015]:
A moderate asthma e xacerbation is considered to be a deterioration in asthma 
symptoms, deterioration in lung function, or increased rescue bronchodilator use 
lasting for at least 2 day sor more, but will not be severe enough to warrant 
systemic corticosteroid use (or a doubl ing or more of the maintenance s ystemic 
corticosteroid dose, if applicable) for 3 day s or more and/or hospitalisation .
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
79A moderate asthma exacerbation is an event that, when recognized, should result 
in a temporary  change in treatment, in an effort to preve nt the exacerbation from 
becoming severe.
As eDiary  alerts are triggered on the second day  of a change from baseline in asthma 
symptoms, lung function, and/or rescue medication , subjects and Investigators are asked 
to investigate eDiary  alerts at the time they are received. Subjects are also instructed to 
contact the Investigator for signs of worsening asthma that may  not be triggered b y 
eDiary  data. The paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet must also be 
reviewed b y the Investigator (or appropr iately trained designee) at each visit to the study  
site to assist the I nvestigator in the identification of new asthma exacerbations.   At the 
Investigator ’s discretion, a temporary  change in background asthma medication will be 
permitted in order to treat the sy mptoms of a moderate asthma exacerbation (see Section 
6.9.1.1 for details). If a subject experiences a second moderate asthma exacerbation 
requiring a change in therap y, the Investigator may choose to continue the additi onal 
therap y for as long as medically appropriate.
7.3.6.2. Severe A sthma Exacerbation
A severe asthma exacerbation is defined as :
The deterioration of asthma requiring the use of sy stemic corticosteroids (tablets, 
suspension or injection), or an increase from a st able maintenance dose1, for at least 3 
days.
1For subjects receiving maintenance systemic corticosteroids, at least double the 
maintenance systemic corticosteroid dose for at least 3 days is required.
OR
An inpatient hospitalization or emergency  departme nt visit because of asthma, requiring 
systemic corticosteroids.
7.4. Health Outcomes
7.4.1. Work Productivity and A ctivity Impairment -Specific Health 
Problem (WPA I-SHP)
The WPAI -SHP (version 2) is a self administered tool comprised of 6 questions which 
address absente eism, presenteeism (reduced effectiveness while working), overall work 
productivity  loss (absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activity  impairment.  This 
validated tool captures data from the past 7 day s.  WPAI -SHP (asthma) outcomes are 
scored as impairment percentages, with a higher percentage indicating greater 
impairment and less productivity [Reilly 1993 ].
The WPAI -SHP will be completed at specific study  visits as defined in the Time and 
Events table (see Section 7.1).
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
807.5. Safet y
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are listed in the Time and Events t able 
(Section 7.1).
7.5.1. Adverse Events (A E) and Serious A dverse Events (S AEs)
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 .
The Investigator and their designees are responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 
7.5.1.1. Time period and Frequency  for collecting A E and SA E informati on
Any SAEs assessed as related to study  participation (e.g., protocol -mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK 
product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the 
study  up to and i ncluding any  follow -up contact. 
AEs will be collected from the start of Study  Treatment until the follow -up 
contact (see Section 7.5.1.3 ), at the timepoints sp ecified in the Time and Events 
table (Section 7.1).
Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study  treatment but after 
obtaining informed consent may  be recorded on the Medical History /Current 
Medical Conditions section of the eCRF.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to GSK wit hin 24 hours, as indicated in 
Appendix 4 .
Investigator s are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study 
subjects. However, if the Investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y 
time after a subject has been d ischarged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event reasonabl y related to the study  treatment or study  participation, the 
Investigator must promptly  notify  GSK.
NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs 
plus pro cedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSK are provided in 
Appendix 4
7.5.1.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended 
and non -leading verbal question ing of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  Appropriate questions include:
“How are you feeling?” 
“Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” 
“Have you taken an y new medicines, other than tho se provided in this study , since 
your last visit/contact?” 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
81Subjects will beissued with a paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet to 
record medical problems experienced and medications used during the study (please refer 
to the SRM for further details) .This paper worksheet will be used to assist subject recall 
in discussions with the Investigator (or designee) , for site staff to then enter as 
appropriate in the eCRF.
7.5.1.3. Follo w-up of A Es and SA Es
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator isrequired to proactivel y follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special interest 
(as defined in Section 7.5.2 ) will be followed until resolution, until the condition 
stabilizes, unt il the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up 
(as defined in Section 5.6.2 ). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in 
Appendix 4 .
7.5.1.4. Cardiovascular and Death Ev ents
7.5.1.4.1. Cardiovascular Events
Cardiovascular -related AEs and SAEs that will require the Investigator to complete event
specific pages in the eCRF are listed in Appendix 4 .
Cardiovascular events information should be recorded on the corr esponding eCRF pages 
within one week of when the AE/SAE(s) are first reported. Please refer to Appendix 4 for
timelines for reporting AE/SAEs.
7.5.1.4.2. Death Events
In addition, all deaths will require completion of a specific death data colle ction page in 
the eCRF. The death data collection page in the eCRF includes questions regarding 
cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death.
Death information should be recorded on the death eCRF page within one week of whe n 
the death is first reported.
Please refer to Appendix 4 fortimelines for reporting SAEs.
7.5.1.5. Pneumonia
Medical history  will also be taken for pneumonia in previous 12 months, including 
recording of an y episodes resulting in hospitalisa tion. Where possible a chest X -ray 
should be performed to confirm a diagnosis, whenever a subject has a suspected 
pneumonia.   Suspected pneumonias will require confirmation as defined by the presence 
of new infiltrate(s) on chest x -ray AND at least 2 of t he following signs and sy mptoms: 
Increased cough 
Increased sputum purulence (color) or production 
Auscultatory  findings of adventitious sounds ( e.g., egophon y, bronchial breath 
sounds, rales, etc.)
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
82Dyspnea or tachy pnea
Fever (oral temperature > 37.5 degrees centigrade [ °C])
Elevated white blood cells ( WBC )(>10,000/ millimetres cubed [ mm3]or >15% 
immature forms)
Hypoxemia ( Oxyhemoglobin ( HbO2 )saturation <88% or at least 2% lower than 
baseline value)
All pneumonias must be captured on the AE/SAE page of the eCRF and on the 
pneumonia page of the eCRF. 
For all suspected cases of pneumonia, investigator s are strongl y encouraged to confirm 
the diagnosis (this includes obtaining a chest x -ray) and to initiate appropriate therap y as 
promptly  as possible. All d iagnoses of pneumonia (radiographicall y confirmed or 
unconfirmed) must be reported as an AE or SAE (if applicable).
7.5.1.6. Radiography  (Chest X -Rays)
Confirmation by  chest x -ray (posteroanterior and lateral) should be performed as soon as 
possible and preferabl y within 48 hours of suspected pneumonia.  In all cases, the signs 
and sy mptoms that were used to identify  the pneumonia must be documented in the 
source documents and eCRF. Diagnoses of pneumonia must be recorded as adverse 
events in the eCRF.
7.5.1.7. Regulatory  Reporting Requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification by  the Investigator to GSK of SAEs related to study  treatment (even 
for non -interventional post -marketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and 
ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subjects and the safety  of a product under 
clinical investigation are met. 
GSK has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authorit y and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation.  GSK will 
comply with country  specific regulatory  requirements relating to safet y reporting to the 
regulatory  authorit y, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and Investigator s.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared for suspected unexpe cted serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory  requirements and GSK policy  and are forwarded 
to Investigator s as necessary .
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety  report describing a SAE(s) or other 
specific safet y information (e .g., summary  or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with 
the IB and will notify  the I RB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.

7.5.3. Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female subjects will be collected after the start of 
dosing and until the safety  follow -up contact/v isit.
If a pregnan cy is reported then the Investigator should inform GSK within 2 
weeks of learning of the pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in 
Appendix 5 .
7.5.4. Physical Exams
Physical exams will be performed at the time points specified i n the Time and Events 
table (Section 7.1).
A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessment of the 
Cardiovascular, Respiratory , Gastrointes tinal and Neurological s ystems.
Height and weight wi ll be measured at Visit 1.
7.5.5. Vital Signs
Vital signs will be performed at the time points specified in the Time and Events table 
(Section 7.1) prior to conducting spirometry  and prior to taking the morning dose of 
study  treatment. Blood pressu re (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate will be measured in 
the sitting position after approximately  5 minutes rest. A single set of values will be 
collected and recorded in the source documentation and eCRF.
7.5.6. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
All sites will use s tandardised ECG equipment provided by  a centralized external vendor. 
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1), a single 12 -lead ECG and rhy thm strip will be recorded 
after the measurement of vital signs but before performing the pre -bronchodilator 
spirometry  asses sment. At the post -randomization visits, a single 12 -lead ECG and 
rhythm strip will be recorded 15 to 45 minutes after the administration of study  treatment. 
Recordings will be made at the time -points defined in the Time and Events table (Section 
7.1). All ECG measurements will be made with the subject in a supine position having 
rested in this position for approximately  5 minutes before each reading.
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
85For subjects who meet the QTc, protocol defined stopping criteria, triplicate ECGs (over 
a brief period of time) should be performed ( Section 5.6.4 ).
The Investigator, a designated sub -Investigator or other appropriatel y trained site 
personnel will be responsible for performing each 12 -lead ECG. The Investigator must 
provide his/her dated signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticit y 
of the ECG machine interpretation.
All ECGs will be electronically  transmitted to an independent cardiologist and evaluated. 
The independent cardiolo gist, blinded to treatment assignment, will be responsible for 
providing measurements of heart rate, QT intervals and an interpretation of all ECGs 
collected in this study . A hard cop y of these results will be sent to the I nvestigator. The 
Investigator mus t provide his/her dated signature on the confirmed report, attesting to 
his/her review of the independent cardiologist’s assessment.
Details of the cardiac monitoring procedures will be provided b y the centralized 
cardiology  service provider.
7.5.7. Clinical Safe ty Laboratory  Assessments
All protocol required laboratory  assessments (haematology , clinical chemistry  and 
urinaly sis) must be conducted in accordance with the Laboratory  Manual, and P rotocol 
Time and Events table (Section 7.1).Laboratory  requisition forms must be completed 
and samples must be clearly  labelled with the subject number, protocol number, 
site/centre number, and visit date. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples 
will be provided by  the laboratory  and are detailed in the L aboratory  Manual. Reference 
ranges for all safety  parameters will be provided to the site by  the laboratory  responsible 
for the assessments.
All blood sa mples which will be taken pre -dose, will be sent to a central laboratory  for 
analysis (details provided in the L aboratory  Manual). Standard reference ranges will be 
used.
If additional non -protocol specified laboratory  assessments are performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory  and result in a change in subject management or are 
considered clinically  significant by  the Investigator (e.g., SAE or AE or dose 
modification) the results must be recorded in the eCRF.
Refer to the Laboratory  Manual for appropriate processing and handling of samples to 
avoid duplicate and/or additional b lood draws.

for site staff to th en enter as appropriate in the eCRF.
7.6. Pharmacokinetics (PK)
Concentrations of FF, UMEC and VI in plasma will be determined using currentl y
approved assay  methodology  under the control of GSK . A population PKapproach will 
be employ ed in this study ; the PK s amples will be collected at the time points specified in 
Section 7.1.
The actual date and time of each blood sampl e collection will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Thedate and time of study  treatment administration on the day  prior t o the clinic visit 
will be recorded in the eCRF. This is to ensure appropriate usage of the pre -dose PK data.
Details of PK blood sample collection (including volume to be collected), processing, 
storage and shipping procedures are provided in the SRM .
Thefollowing points must be noted: 
If assessments are scheduled for the same nominal time, THEN the assessments 
should occur in the following order (as applicable) :
1.Vital signs
2.12-lead ECG
3.blood draws.  
Note: The timing of the assessments should allow the blood draw to occur at the 
exact nominal time.
The change in timing or addition of time points for any  planned stud y 
assessments must be documented in a Note to File which is approved b y the
relevant GSK stud y team member and then archived in the study spo nsor and 
site study  files, but this will not constitute a protocol amendment. 
The I RB/IEC will be informed of any  safet y issues that require alteration of the 
safet y monitoring scheme or amendment of the Informed Consent Form. 
No more than 500 mL of bloo d will be collected over the duration of the study , 
including an y extra assessments that may  be required.
7.6.1. Blood Sample Collection
Blood samples for PK analy sis of FF, UMEC and VI will be collected pre-dose from 
ALL subjects at Visit 6 (or Visit 8/EOS [if t his visit occurs at Week 24] or, if applicable, 
the Earl y Withdrawal Visit [see Section 7.1]).
7.6.1.1. Pharmacokinetic Sub -study
At Visit 3 , consenting subjects who are randomised to participate in the main study  will 
be entered into t he PK sub-study .
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
88In a subset of approximately  20% of the subjects randomised to participate in the main 
study , PK samples will be ob tained at pre -dose on the dayof Visit 5 , and 1 sample in 
each of the following three time windows: 5min -30min, 45min -90min, and 2-3h post 
dose on the dayof Visit 5. 
The methodology  for inclusion of consenting subjects into the PK sub -study  is provided 
in the SRM.
7.6.2. Sample A nalysis
Plasma analy sis will be performed under the management of Bioanal ytical Science and
Toxicokinetic s (BST), Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK), GSK. 
Concentrations of UMEC, VI  and FF will be determined in plasma samples using the 
currentl y approved anal ytical methodology .
Personnel involved in the bioanaly sis of PK samples will be unblinded as per GSK
policy . Samples will be analy zed onl y for relevant anal yte, e.g. (FF/VI) treatment
samples will not be anal yzed for UMEC concentrations. 
Raw data will be stored in the Good Laboratory  Practice (GLP) Archives, GSK or at a 
designated contract labo ratory . Once the plasma has been anal yzed for UMEC, VI  and FF 
any remaining plasma may  be analy zed qualitatively  for other circulating metabolites and 
the results reported under a separate DMPK protocol.
7.7. Genetics
Information regarding genetic/ pharmacogene tic (PGx) research is included in Appendix 
3.  The IEC/I RB and, where required, the applicable regulatory  agency  must approve the 
PGx and genetic assessments before these can be conducted at the site.  The approval(s) 
must be in writi ng and will clearly specify  approval of the PGx and genetic assessments 
(i.e., approval of Appendix 3 ).  In some cases, approval of the PGx and genetic 
assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the stud y.  If so , then the 
written approval will clearly  indicate approval of the PGx and genetic assessments is 
being deferred and the study , except for PGx and genetic assessments, can be initiated.  
When PGx and genetic assessments will not be approved, then the approv al for the rest of 
the study  will clearl y indicate this and therefore, PGx and genetic assessments will not be 
conducted.
8. DATA MANAGEMENT
For this study  subject data will be entered into GSK defined eCRFs, transmitted 
electronically  to GSK or designee and combined with data provided from other 
sources in a validated data sy stem.   
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable 
GSK standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrit y of the data, 
e.g., removing errors a nd inconsistencies in the data.
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
89Adverse events and concomitant medications terms will be coded using MedDRA 
(Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities) and an internal validated 
medication dictionary , GSKDrug .  
eCRFs (including queries and audit trails ) will be retained b y GSK, and copies 
will be sent to the Investigator to maintain as the Investigator copy.  Subject 
initials will not be collected or transmitted to GSK according to GSK policy.
9. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND DA TA 
ANALYSES
9.1. Hypotheses
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy and safet y ofUMEC in 
combination with FF/VI in subjects with asthma over a 24 week treatment period.  This is 
a superiorit y study to demonstrate the add -on benefit of UMEC at two dosage strengths
62.5 mcg and 31.25 mcg in a single inhaler when compare to FF/VI. The primary  
efficacy  endpoint is the mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1 at the end of the 24 -
week treatment period .
For each test on each efficacy  endpoint, the null hy pothesis is tha t there is no difference 
between treatment groups. 
H0: T1 –T2 = 0
Thealternative hy pothesis is that there is a difference between treatment groups.
H1: T1 –T2 ≠ 0
For the primary  endpoint and other lung function related efficacy  endpoints, the primary  
treatment comparisons of interest are the comparisons for each triple therapy and the 
respective dual therap y FF/VI without the UMEC component as follows:  
UMEC 6 2.5mcg: 
FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg vs. FF/VI 100/25 mcg
FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 mcg vs. FF/ VI 200/25 mcg
UMEC 31.25 mcg: 
FF/UMEC/VI 100/31.25/25 mcg vs. FF/VI 100/25 mcg
FF/UMEC/VI 200/31.25/25 mcg vs. FF/ VI 200/25 mcg
Therefore T 1and T 2for these e ndpoints are the mean changes from baseline for the 
individual triple therapy  and dual therap y, respectively , as listed above. 
For the key  secondary  endpoint and all other non -lung function efficacy  endpoints, the 
primary  treatment comparisons of interest are the comparisons between triple therapy  and 
dual therap y for a fixed dose of UMEC:

For example, T 1and T 2in the hy pothesis associated with the key  secondary  efficacy  
endpoint are the averages of the mean annualized rate of moderate/severe exacerbations 
for the triple therapies over two FF doses at a given UMEC dose, and for the dual 
therapies over two FF doses, respectiv ely.
Details on all pairwise treatment comparisons of interest are provided in Section 9.3.3 .
9.2. Sample Size Considerations
9.2.1. Sample Size A ssumptions
Sample size calculation is based on the primary  efficacy  endpoint of mean change f rom 
baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of the 24 -week treatment period.
A total of 2250 randomized subjects are required for this study , with 375 subjects in each 
of the sixdouble -blind treatment groups: 
FF/V I 100/25 mcg
FF/V I 200/25 mcg
FF/UMEC/VI 100/ 31.25/25 mcg
FF/UMEC/VI 200/ 31.25 /25 mcg
FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg
FF/UMEC/VI 200/ 62.5/25 mcg
Assuming 10% missi ng data on spirometry  at the end of the 24 -week treatment period,
due to earl y withdrawal from study, approximately 337 subjects per treatment g roup 
should have trough FEV 1data available for the analy sis. 
The standard deviation for the mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1at the end of 
the 24 -week treatment period is estimated to be 400 mL based on previous asthma 
studies.  The proposed samp le size of n=337 per treatment group should provide 90% 
power, assuming a difference of 100 mL, based on a two sample t -test with a two sided 
significance level of 0.05 for each of the two primary  comparisons of interest for each 
UMEC dose.
For the target population, it is assumed that the mean exacerbation rate is 2 per y ear for 
the control group FF/VI; this was based on a review of previous FF/VI asthma 
exacerbation stud y conducted b y GSK and Tio asthma studies conducted by Boehringer 
Ingelheim .  The prop osed sample size of 750 randomzed subject per arm (based on the 
treatment comparison of combined triple therapies and combined dual therapies with both 
FF doses) should have  approximately  95% power if the true reduction in exacerbation 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
91rate for triple the rapy vs. dual therap y is 20%. The calculation assumes the number of 
exacerbations per year follows a negative binomial distribution [ Keene 2007], with a 
dispersion parameter k=0.7 based on a previous FF/VI asthma exacerbation study , and 
assumes the following accelerative recruitment rate per week over a period of 39 weeks:
3.5 weeks at 15 patients/week
4.5 weeks at 25 patients/week
4.5 weeks at 35 patients/week
4.5 weeks at 45 patients/week
4.5 weeks at 55 patients/week
4.5 weeks at 70 patients/week
13 weeks at 90 patients/week 
The duration of the treatment period is variable but will be at least 24 weeks and up to a
maximum of 52 weeks, with the end of study  date being established once the last subject 
has been randomized.
9.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity
To demonstrate the sensitivity  of the sample size calculation for this study , the following 
table and graph show the power function for a fixed sample size of n=337 per arm in the 
ITT population for the primary  efficacy  anal ysis, vary ing the o bserved treatment

959.3. Data Analysis Considerations
9.3.1. Analysis Populations
The following subject populations will be identified:
All Subjects Enrolled Population: This population will comprise all subjects for whom a 
record exists on the study  database, including pre -screened subjects that sign the 
informed consent document but do not complete a Visit 1 (screening) procedure (i.e., pre -
screening failures), or subjects that complete at least one Visit 1 proce dure but do not 
enter the run -in period (i.e., screening failures). This population will be used for the 
summary  of subject disposition . 
All Subjects Screened Population: This population contains all subjects that complete at 
least one Visit 1 (Screening) procedure. This population will be used for the summary  of 
subject disposition (including reasons for screening failures, run -in failures, and 
stabilization failures) and for the listing of AEs and SAEs for non -randomized subjects. 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: This population will comprise all randomized subjects , 
excluding those who were randomized in error. A subject who is recorded as a screen 
failure, run -in failure, or stabilization failure, but is randomized and does not receive a 
dose of study treatment, is considered to be randomized in error. Any other subject who 
receives a randomization number will be considered to have been randomized. This will 
constitute the primary  population for all efficacy  and safet y analyses. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) population: This population will comprise all subject sin the I TT 
Population for whom a PK sample was obtained and anal yzed.
9.3.2. Interim A nalysis
No interim anal ysis is planned for this study .
9.3.3. Treatment Comparisons
To demonstrate the benefit of UMEC when added to FF/VI treatment arms with the same 
FF dose, the primary  comparisons of interest for the primary  efficacy  endpoint are:
The replicate efficacy  for UMEC 62.5 mcg dosage :
oFF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg vs. FF/VI 100/25 mcg
oFF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 mcg vs. FF/ V I 200/25 mcg
The replicate efficacy  for UMEC 31.25 mcg dosage:
oFF/UMEC/VI 100/31.25/25 mcg vs. FF/VI 100/25 mcg
oFF/UMEC/VI 200/31.25/25 mcg vs. FF/ VI 200/25 mcg
For the multiple comparisons and multiplicity  adjustment, s ee Section 9.3.4 .
To allow evaluation of the effect of FF/UMEC/VI on non -lung function efficacy  
endpoints, including the key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint on moderate/severe 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
96exacerbations, for each fixed UMEC dose, the data from the two FF/UMEC/VI  arms will 
be pooled and compared to the pooled data from the two FF/VI arms.
FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 and 200/62.5/25) vs. FF/VI (100/25 and 200/25) 
FF/UMEC/VI (100/31.25/25 and 200/31.25/25) vs. FF/VI (100/25 and 200/25).
The integrated anal yses will provide a more pr ecise overall estimate for the treatment 
effect size of the addition of UMEC to FF/VI.
Other pairwise treatment comparisons of interest consist of the following assessments for 
all efficacy  endpoints:
1)Triple therap y with low dose FF vs. dual therap y with high dose FF:
FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 vs. FF/VI 200/25
FF/UMEC/VI 100/31.25/25 vs. FF/VI 200/25
2)The benefit of increase FF dose in triple therap y:
FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 vs.  FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25
FF/UMEC/VI 200/31.25/25 vs.  FF/UMEC/VI 100/31.25/25
3)The b enefit of increasing UMEC dose in triple therap y:
FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 vs. FF/UMEC/VI 100/31.25/25
FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 vs. FF/UMEC/VI 200/31.25/25
9.3.4. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity
In order to account for multiple tests involving two UMEC doses a nd across multiple 
efficacy  endpoints, a step -down testi ng procedure will be applied whereb y inference for a 
test in the pre -defined hierarch y is dependent upon statistical significance having been 
achieved for the previous tests in the hierarch y. 
A step -down closed testing approach will be applied for the primary efficacy  endpoint, 
the key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint , and the secondary  efficacy  endpoint sSGRQ, ACQ -
7, and E -RS. Specificall y, if the defined treatment comparisons for the primary  efficacy  
endpoint between triple therap y and dual therap y at the high dose of UMEC 62.5 mcg are 
statistically  significant at the 0.05 level for both fixed FF doses (100 and 200mcg) , then 
the replicate efficacy  of UMEC 62.5mcg is demonstrated, and the defined treatment
comparison between triple therap y and dual therapy  will be test edfor the key secondary  
efficacy  endpoint of moderate/severe asthma exacerbations based on the combined data 
of both FF doses for UMEC 62.5mcg . If the test for the key  secondary  efficacy  endp oint 
is statistically  significant at the 0.05 level, then the secondary  efficacy  endpoints for 
SGRQ ( Mean change from baseline in SGRQ at Week 24) and ACQ -7 (Mean change 
from baseline in ACQ -7 atWeek 24) will be tested sequentially  based on the combined 
data of both FF doses for UMEC 62.5mcg at significance level 0.05.
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
97If all tests mentioned above for UMEC 62.5 mcg are statistically  significant at the 0.05 
level, the above testing hierarchy  for the primary  efficacy  endpoint, the key  secondary  
efficacy  endp oint, and the secondary  efficacy  endpoints SGRQ and ACQ -7 will be 
repeated for the low dose of UMEC 31.25 mcg.
If all tests for the primary , the key  secondary , and the secondary  efficacy  endpoints for 
SGRQ and ACQ -7 are statistically  significant at the 0.0 5 level for both UMEC 62.5mcg 
and 31.25mcg, the secondary  endpoint for E -RS (Mean change from baseline in E -RS 
score over the Weeks 21 -24 (inclusive) of the treatment period) will be tested at the 
significance level 0.05 for UMEC 62.5 and UMEC 31.25 in seq uence.
The famil y-wise Ty pe I Error is strongl y controlled at 0.05 level for both UMEC 
62.5mcg and UMEC 31.25mcg on the primary  endpoint (trough FEV1),  the key  
secondary  endpoint (moderate/severe asthma exacerbations), and the secondary  endpoints 
on SGRQ, ACQ -7, and E -RS.  
All secondary  non-lung function efficacy  endpoints will be tested for triple vs. dual using 
the combined data of both FF doses , at a given UMEC dose . The full testing hierarch y is

9.4. Key Elements of A nalysis Plan
Where possible, data from subjects who withdraw prematurely  from the study  treatment 
or the study  will be included in any  relevant anal yses. Specific details for inclusion will 
be detailed in the Reporting and Anal ysis Plan (RAP). 
In general, the baseline value is the last assessment value prior to randomization at Visit 3
for the efficacy  endpoints based on assessments at clinic visits, and the average value 
over the last 14 day s prior to randomization during the stabilization period for the 
efficacy  endpoints based on subjects’ diary  data.  The covariates to be considered in the 
efficacy  anal yses include age, sex, the randomization stratification variable , and the 
baseline value, if relevant. For the pooled anal yses of triple therap y vs. dual on non -lung 
function efficacy  endpoints using combined data from both FF doses, t he FF dosage will 
also be included in the analy sis model as a categorical covariate to account for possible 
heterogeneity and/or data variability  resulted from different ICS doses. Other covariates, 
if appropriate, may  be considered. Specific details will be provided i n the RAP.
9.4.1. Primary  Analyses
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the m ean change from baseline in trough FEV 1at the 
end of the 24 -week treatment period. For each subject, the baseline value of clinic FEV 1 
is the last acceptable/borderline accepta ble (pre -dose) FEV1 value obtained prior to 
randomization (either from Visit 3 pre -dose or from Visit 2 pre -bronchodilator ).
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will evaluate the “de facto” ty pe estimand in the I ntent -to-
Treat population, using a mixed -model r epeated measures (MMRM) analysis , including 
all trough FEV 1recorded post randomization.  Analy ses will include the fixed, 
categorical effects of treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, sex,randomization 
stratification by pre-study  ICS treatment dosage strength (mid, high) at screening , as well 
as the continuous, fixed covariates of age, baseline value, and baseline value by  visit 
interaction.  Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the 
following primary  comparisons o f interest. 
There are two treatment comparisons to demonstrate the replicate efficacy  for the UMEC 
62.5 mcg dose:

101FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg vs. FF/VI 100/25 mcg
FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 mcg vs. FF/ V I 200/25 mcg
Additionally , there will be two treatment co mparisons for the UMEC 31.25 mcg dose to 
demonstrate the replicate efficacy  for the UMEC 31.25 mcg dose:
FF/UMEC/VI 100/31.25/25 mcg vs. FF/VI 100/25 mcg
FF/UMEC/VI 200/31.25/25 mcg vs. FF/ VI 200/25 mcg
In addition, a de jure estimand, including data coll ected over the randomized double -
blind treatment period, will be analy zed using a MMRM model. Sensitivity  anal yses to 
assess the impact of missing data will be detailed in the RAP.
Other pairwise treatment comparisons of interest as outlined in Section 9.3.3 will also be 
provided for the primary  efficacy  endpoint.
9.4.2. Secondary  Analyses
The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint is the annualized rate of moderate/severe asthma 
exacerbations.  Moderate/severe asthma exacerbations from the s tart to the end of double -
blinded study  period will be used in the anal ysis, regardless of subject’s IP completion 
status. Exacerbations separated b y less than 7 days will be treated as a continuation of the 
same exacerbation.
The exacerbation rate will be analysed using a generalised linear model, assuming the 
number of exacerbations has a negative binomial probability  distribution and that its 
mean is related to covariate factors with a ‘log link’ function. The logarithm of time 
(year) on study  will be us ed as an offset variable. The model will include covariates for 
age, sex, treatment group, randomization stratification bypre-study  ICStreatment dosage 
strength (mid, high) at screening , and the FF dosage (categorical). 
For each given UMEC dose, there i s one treatment comparison of interest to demonstrate 
the efficacy  of UMEC for the key  secondary  endpoint, based on the pooled data from 
both FF doses for triple therap y and dual therap y, respectivel y:
FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 and 200/62.5/25) vs. FF/VI (10 0/25 and 200/25) 
FF/UMEC/VI (100/31.25 /25 and 200/ 31.25 /25) vs. FF/V I (100/25 and 200/25) .
All pairwise treatment comparisons of interest as outlined in Section 9.3.3 will also be 
provided for the key  secondary  efficacy  endpoi nt.
9.4.3. Other A nalyses
Full details of the analy ses to be performed on all efficacy  endpoints, as well as details of 
time points to be analy zed, will be given in the RAP.

1029.4.4. Examination of Subgroups and Phenoty pic Characteristics
To explore differential responses and the phenot ypic characteristics, subgroup and 
exploratory  anal yses may be considered. Of particular interest are the following 
phenoty pic variables: age, sex, baseline lung function, rever sibility  to albuterol and 
ipratropium, asthma disease history , atopic status, exacerbation histo ry, and biomarkers 
(blood and Fe NO). The details of these exploratory  analy ses will be provided in the RAP.
9.4.5. Pharmacokinetic A nalyses
The purpose of PK sampling in this study  is for characterisation of PK of FF, UMEC and 
VI in the target asthma patients following FF/UMEC/VI administration . Plasma 
concentration -time data for FF, UMEC and VI will be subjected separatel y to nonlinear 
mixed effects modelling using NONMEM or other programs to develop the population 
PK models. Full details of the anal yses for PK endpoints will be provided in the RAP.
9.4.6. Exploratory  Analysis
The psy chometric properties of the E -RS (see Section 7.3.5.1.1 ) and Supplemental 
asthma items (see Section 7.3.5.1.2 ) will be evaluated to support qualification of the E -
RS as an endpoint for asthma.  These exploratory  anal yses may  be provided in a separate 
RAP.

10.2. Regulatory  and Ethical Considerations, Including the 
Informed Consent Process
Prior to initiation of a site, GSK wil l obtain favourable opinion/approval from the 
appropriate regulatory  agency  to conduct the stud y in accordance with International 
Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH)Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable 
country -specific regulatory  requirements.
The st udy will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements, 
and with GSK policy .
The study  will also be conducted in accordance with I CH Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
all applicable subject privacy  requirements, and the guiding princip les of the current 
version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
IRB/IEC review and favorable opinion/approval of the study  protocol and 
amendments as applicable
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
103Obtaining signed informed consent
Investigator reporting requirements (e.g. reporting of AEs/SAEs/protocol 
deviations to I RB/IEC)
GSK will provide full details of the above procedures, either verball y, in writing, 
or both.
Signed informed consent must be obtained for each subject prior to participatio n 
in the study
The IEC/I RB, and where applicable the regulatory authority , approve the clinical 
protocol and all optional assessments, including genetic research.  
Optional assessments (including those in a separate protocol and/or under separate 
informed consent) and the clinical protocol should be concurrentl y submitted for 
approval unless regulation requires separate submission.  
Approval of the optional assessments may  occur after approval is granted for the 
clinical protocol where required b y regulat ory authorities.  I n this situation, 
written approval of the clinical protocol should state that approval of optional 
assessments is being deferred and the study , with the exception of the optional 
assessments, can be initiated.
10.3. Qualit y Control (Study  Moni toring)
In accordance with applicable regulations including GCP, and GSK procedures, 
GSK monitors will contact the site prior to the start of the study  to review with the 
site staff the protocol, study  requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  
regulatory , ethical, and GSK requirements.  
When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include 
identification, agreement and documentation of data items for which the eCRF
will serve as the source document.
GSK will monitor the stud y and site activity to verify  that the:
Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected.
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol and any  
other study  agreements, GCP, and all applic able regulatory  requirements.
The Investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents .
10.4. Qualit y Assurance
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory  requirements, GSK 
may conduct a quality  assurance assessment and/or audit of the site records, and 
the regulatory  agencies may  conduct a regulatory inspection at any  time during or 
after completion of the study . 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
104In the event of an assessment, audit or inspec tion, the Investigator (and institution) 
must agree to grant the advisor(s), auditor(s) and inspector(s) direct access to all 
relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to discuss 
the conduct of the stud y, any findings/releva nt issues and to implement any  
corrective and/or preventative actions to address any  findings/issues identified.
10.5. Stud y and Site Closure
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study , the GSK monitor will 
conduct site closure activities with the Investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in 
accordance with applicable regulations including GCP, and GSK Standard 
Operating Procedures.
GSK reserves the right to temporaril y suspend or prematurel y discontinue this 
study  at an y time for reasons includi ng, but not limited to, safety  or ethical issues 
or severe non -compliance. For multicenter studies, this can occur at one or more 
or at all sites.  
If GSK determines such action is needed, GSK will discuss the reasons for taking 
such action with the Inves tigator or the head of the medical institution (where 
applicable).  When feasible, GSK will provide advance notification to the 
Investigator or the head of the medical institution, where applicable, of the 
impending action.
If the stud y is suspended or pre maturely  discontinued for safet y reasons, GSK will 
promptly  inform all Investigator s, heads of the medical institutions (where 
applicable) and/or institution(s) conducting the study . GSK will also promptly  
inform the relevant regulatory  authorities of the suspension or premature 
discontinuation of the study  and the reason(s) for the action.  
If required b y applicable regulations, the Investigator or the head of the medical 
institution (where applicable) must inform the I RB/I EC promptl y and provide the 
reason for the suspension or premature discontinuation.
10.6. Records Retention
Following closure of the study , the Investigator or the head of the medical 
institution (where applicable) must maintain all site study  records (except for 
those required b y local regula tions to be maintained elsewhere), in a safe and 
secure location.  
The records must be maintained to allow eas y and timely  retrieval, when needed 
(e.g., for a GSK audit or regulatory  inspection) and must be available for review 
in conjunction with assessm ent of the facilit y, supporting s ystems, and relevant 
site staff.  
Where permitted b y local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of 
these records can be maintained in a format other than hard cop y (e.g., microfiche, 
scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is 
taken.  
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
105The Investigator must ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and 
accurate cop y of the original and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, 
including re -generating a hard cop y, if required.  Furthermore, the Investigator
must ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these reproductions and that an 
acceptable qualit y control process exists for making these reproductions.
GSK will inform the Investigator of the time per iod for retaining these records to 
comply  with all applicable regulatory  requirements.  The minimum retention time 
will meet the strictest standard applicable to that site for the study, as dictated by 
any institutional requirements or local laws or regula tions, GSK 
standards/procedures, and/or institutional requirements.  
The Investigator must notify  GSK of any  changes in the archival arrangements, 
including, but not limited to, archival at an off -site facility  or transfer of 
ownership of the records in t he event the Investigator is no longer associated with 
the site.
10.7. Provision of Study  Results to Investigators, Posting of 
Information on Publically  Available Clinical Trials Registers 
and Publication
Where required b y applicable regulatory  requirements, an Investigator signatory  will be 
identified for the approval of the clinical study  report.  The Investigator will be provided 
reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the 
opportunity  to review the complete study  results at a GSK site or other mutually -
agreeable location.
GSK will also provide the Investigator with the full summary  of the stud y results.  The 
Investigator is encouraged to share the summary  results with the study  subjects, as 
appropriate. GSK will prov ide the Investigator with the randomization codes for their site 
only after completion of the full statistical anal ysis.
The procedures and timing for public disclosure of the results summary  and for 
development of a manuscript for publication will be in a ccordance with GSK Policy .

11212.2. Appendix 2 Liver Safety  Required A ctions and Follow up 
Assessments
Liver chemistry stopping and follow up criteria have b een designed to assure subject 
safet y and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical 
liver safet y guidance [ Food and Drug Administration 2009]).
Liver chemistry  stopping criteria 1 -5 are defined below:
1.ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xUL N (>35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT 3xULN 
and INR>1.5, if INR measured)
NOTE: I f serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately  available, withdraw study  drug 
if AL T 3xULN and bili rubin 2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be 
performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable 
urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver 
injury .
2.ALT 8xUL N.
3.ALT 5xULN but <8 xULN persists for 2 weeks
4.ALT  3xULN if associated with sy mptoms (new or worsening) believed to be 
related to  hepatitis (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be re lated to hy persensitivity  (such as fever, 
rash or eosinophilia).
5.ALT 5xULN but <8 xULN and cannot be monitored weekl y for 2 weeks
When any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria 1 -5 is met, do the following:
Immediately withdraw investigational produc t
Report the event to GSK within 24 hours of learning its occurrence
Complete the liver event CRF and SAE data collection tool if the event also meets 
the criteria for an SAE. All events of ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xULN (>35% 
direct) (or ALT 3xULN andINR>1.5, if INR measured); INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply  to patients receiving 
anticoagulants), termed ‘Hy ’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE (excluding 
studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) . 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediatel y available, withdraw study drug 
if AL T 3xULN andbilirubin 2xUL N. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be 
performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable 
urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver 
injury .
Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy  CRFs if these tests are performed
Perform liver event follow up assessments, and monitor the subject until liver 
chemistries resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline values as described below. 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
113Withdraw the subject from the study (unless further safety follow up is required) 
after completion of the liver chemistry  monitoring as described below.
Do not re -challenge w ith investigational product.
In addition, for criterion 1: 
Make every  reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24 hours for 
repeat liver chemistries, liver event follow up assessments (see below), and close 
monitoring
A specialist or h epatology  consultation is recommended
Monitor subjects twice weekl y until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values
For criteria 2, 3, 4 and 5:
Make every  reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24 -72 hrs for 
repeat liver chemistries and liver event follow up assessments (see below)
Monitor subjects weekl y until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within ba seline values; criterion 5 subjects 
should be monitored as frequently  as possible.
Subjects with AL T 5xULN and <8xULN which exhibit a decrease to ALT x 3xULN, 
but <5xUL N and bilirubin <2xUL N without hepatitis sy mptoms or rash, and who can be 
monitored wee kly for 4 weeks:
Notify  the GSK medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of the abnormality  to 
discuss subject safet y
Can continue investigational product 
Must return weekl y for repeat liver chemistries (AL T, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) until they resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline 
If at an y time these subjects meet the liver chemistry  stopping criteria, proceed as 
described above
If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xUL N and bilirubin <2xUL N, monitor 
subjects twice monthly  until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline 
values. 
For criteria 1 -5, make every  attempt to carry  out the liver event follow up assessments
described below:
Viral hepatitis serology  including:
Hepatitis A IgM antibody;
Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody  (IgM); 
Hepatitis C RNA; 
Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody ;  
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
114Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibod y (or if unavailable, obtain 
heterophile antibod y or monospot testing);  
Hepatitis E IgM antibody 
Blood sample fo r PK a nalysis, obtained within 72 hours of last dose.  Record the 
date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the last dose of 
investigational product prior to blood sample draw on the CRF. If the date or time of 
the last dose is unclear, pr ovide the subject’s best approximation. I f the date/time of 
the last dose cannot be approximated OR a PK sample cannot be collected in the 
time period indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample. I nstructions for sample 
handling and shipping are in the SRM.
Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehy drogenase (LDH).
Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin 2xUL N
Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia
Record the appearance or worsening of clinical s ymptoms of hepatitis or 
hypersensitivity , such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever rash or eosinophilia as relevant on the AE report form
Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other over 
the counter med ications, or putative hepatotoxins, on the concomitant medications 
report form.
Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake case report form
The following are required for subjects with ALT 3xUL N and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% 
direct) but are optiona l for other abnormal liver chemistries:
Anti-nuclear antibody , anti -smooth muscle antibody , and Ty pe 1 anti -liver kidney  
microsomal antibodies.
Serum acetaminophen adduct assay  (quantifies potential acetaminophen contribution 
to liver injury , detectable by HPLC assay  more than 1 week following 
acetaminophen use) [ James 2009].  
Only  in those with underly ing chronic hepatitis B at study  entry  (identified by  
positive hepatitis B surface antigen):  quantitative hepatitis B DNA and hepatit is 
delta antibody .
Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography ) to 
evaluate liver disease.

11612.3. Appendix 3 Genetic Research
Genetics –Background
Naturall y occurring genetic variation may  contribute to inter -individual variability  in 
response to medicines, as well as an individual's risk of developing specific diseases. 
Genetic factors associated with disease characteristics may  also be associated with 
respons e to therapy , and could help to explain some clinical study  outcomes. For 
example, genetic variants associated with age -related macular degeneration (AMD) are 
reported to account for much of th e risk for the condition [ Gorin 2012] wit h certain 
variants reported to inf luence treatment response [ Chen 2012]. Thus, knowledge of the 
genetic etiology  of disease may  better inform understanding of disease and the 
development of medicines. Additionally , genetic variability  may impact the 
pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination), or 
pharmacod ynamics (relationship between concentration and pharmacologic effects or the 
time course of pharmacologic effects) of a specific medicine and/or clinical o utcomes 
(efficacy  and/or safet y) observed in a clinical study.
Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses
The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic 
variants and: 
Response to medicine or any  concomitant medici nes;
Asthma susceptibility , severity , and progression and related conditions
Genetic data may  be generated while the study  is underway  or following completion of 
the study .  Genetic evaluations may  include focused candidate gene approaches and/or 
examinat ion of a large number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome 
analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study  and will be limited to 
understanding the objectives highlighted above.  Analy ses may  be performed using data 
from multiple clinical studies to investigate these research objectives.
Appropriate descriptive and/or statistical analy sis methods will be used. A detailed 
description of an y planned anal yses will be documented in a Reporting and Analy sis Plan 
(RAP) prio r to initiation of the anal ysis. Planned analy ses and results of genetic 
investigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study  report, or in a 
separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate.
Study Population
Any subject who is enro lled in the study  can participate in genetic research.  Any  subject 
who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the 
genetic research.
Study Assessments and Procedures
A key  component of successful genetic research is the col lection of samples during 
clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
117identified, may  enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand 
variability  in disease and medicine response.  
A 6ml blood sampl e will be taken for Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A 
blood sample is collected at the baseline visit, after the subject has been randomized 
and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collection and 
shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory  manual. The DNA 
from the blood sample may  undergo quality  control analy ses to confirm the integrity  
of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality  of the sample, then the 
sample may  be destroy ed. The bloo d sample is taken on a single occasion unless a 
duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize the original sample.  
The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to 
label other samples and data in the s tudy.   This number can be traced or linked back to 
the subject by  the Investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry  personal 
identifiers (such as name or social security  number). 
Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject 
completes the study , or GSK may  destroy  the samples sooner.  GSK or those working 
with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only  use samples collected from the study  
for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed c onsent form.  Samples may  be 
used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal 
product.
Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any  time.
Informed Consent
Subjects who do not wish to participate in the gene tic research may  still participate in the 
study .  Genetic informed consent must be obtained prior to any  blood being taken.
Subject Withdrawal from Study
If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdraws from the 
clinical study  for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a 
choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if already  
collected:
Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA 
sample is retained
Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy  the genetic DNA 
sample 
If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for an y 
reason, the Investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample 
destruction within the timeframe specified b y GSK and maintain the documentation in 
the site study  records . 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
118Genoty pe data may  be generated during the study  or after completion of the study  and 
may be anal yzed during the study  or stored f or future anal ysis. 
If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been 
analyzed, it will not be analy zed or used for future research.  
Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdrawn consent will 
continue to b e stored and used, as appropriate.
Screen and Baseline Failures
If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the subject 
does not meet the entry  criteria for participation in the study , then the Investigator should 
instruc t the subject that their genetic sample will be destro yed. No forms are required to 
complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample 
reconciliation process.  In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to
include in the site files.
Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality  of Subject’s Genetic Data
GSK may  summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study  report, or 
separately  and may  publish the results in scientific journals. 
GSK may  share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific 
understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, 
family  members, insurers, or employ ers of individual genoty ping results that are not 
known to be rel evant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study , unless 
required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic 
studies is generall y preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific 
validity  of the results are undetermined.  Further, data generated in a research laboratory  
may not meet regulatory  requirements for inclusion in clinical care.

11912.4. Appendix 4 Definition of and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -Up and Reporting of A dverse Events
12.4.1. Definition of A dverse Events
Adverse Event Definition:
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product.
Events meeting AE definition include:
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological sca ns, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the Investigator .
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either a n 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspec ted interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/ self-
harming intent.  This should be reported regardless of sequelae).
"Lack of efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE.  However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be reported if they  fulfil the definition 
of an AE or SAE.
Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include:
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the u nderl ying disease, unless judged by  the 
Investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
120leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
12.4.2. Definition of Serious A dverse Events
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , 
death due to progression of disease, etc).
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, 
at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
NOTE:
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  I t does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might have cause d death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
NOTE:
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually  
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergenc y ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are 
AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serio us criteria, 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not co nsidered an AE.
d.Results in disability/incapacity
NOTE:
The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significan ce such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may  interfere or prevent every day 
life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
121e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defec t
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization bu t may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These should also be considered 
serious.
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse
g.Is associated with liver injury andimpaired liver function define d as:
ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xUL N (>35% direct), or
ALT 3xULN and INR**> 1.5.
* Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, 
measure urinary  bilirubin via dipstick.  I f fractionation is unavaila ble and ALT 3xULN 
and total bilirubin 2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE.
** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply  to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.  If INR measurement is obtained, the va lue is to be 
recorded on the SAE form.
12.4.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events
Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition:
Investigator s will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the 
following AEs and SAEs:
Myocardial infarction/unsta ble angina
Congestive heart failure
Arrh ythmias
Valvulopathy
Pulmonary  hypertension
Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack
Peripheral arterial thromboembolism
Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism
Revascularization
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
12212.4.4. Recording of A Es and SA Es
AEs and SAE Recording:
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the Investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) 
relative to the event.
The Investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in 
the CRF
It is notacceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical 
records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK, AE/SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y GSK.  In this instance, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to 
submission of to GSK.
The Investigator will attempt to estab lish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  I n such cases, the diagnosis will be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.
Subject -completed Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaires an d the collection 
of AE data are independent components of the study .
Responses to each question in the Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaire will 
be treated in accordance with standard scoring and statistical procedures detailed b y 
the scale’s develope r.
The use of a single question from a multidimensional health survey  to designate a 
cause -effect relationship to an AE is inappropriate.
12.4.5. Evaluating AEs and SA Es
Assessment of Intensity
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE an d SAE reported 
during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories:
Mild:  An event that is easily  tolerated by  the subject, causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate:  An event that is sufficientl y discomforting to interfere with normal 
every day activities
Severe:  An event that prevents normal every day activities. -an AE that is assessed 
as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severity  is a category  utilized for rating 
the intensity  of an eve nt; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE.
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
123Assessment of Causality
The Investigator is obligated to assess the re lationship between stud y treatment and 
the occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A "reasonable possibility " is meant to convey  that there are facts/evidence or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled 
out.
The Investigato rwill use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as natural history  of the underly ing diseases, concomitant 
therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study  
treatment will be considere d and investigated.
The Investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he /she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may  be situations when an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK.  However, it is very important 
that the Investi gator always make an assessment of causality for every event 
prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK.
The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordi ngly.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
Follow -up of A Es and SA Es
The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as may  be indicated or as requested by  GSK to 
elucidate as fully  as possible the nature and/or causality  of the AE or SAE.
The Investigator is obligated to assist.  This may  include additional laboratory  tests 
or investigations, histopathological examinati ons or consultation with other health 
care professionals.
If a subject dies during participation in the study  or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator will provide GSK with a copy  of any  post -mortem findings, 
including histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The Investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to GSK within the designated 
reporting time frames.
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L
205715
12412.4.6. Reporting of SA Es to GSK
SAE reporting to GSK via electronic data collection too l
Primary  mechanism for reporting SAEs to GSK will be the electronic data collection 
tool
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for greater than 24 hours, the site will use the 
paper SAE data collection tool and fax it to the assigned SAE contact (see t he 
Medical Monitor/Sponsor Information page at the beginning of this protocol)
Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic s ystem as soon as it 
becomes available.
The Investigator will be required to confirm review of the SAE causali ty by ticking 
the ‘reviewed’ box at the bottom of the eCRF page within 72 hours of submission of 
the SAE.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., 
InForm s ystem) will be taken off -line to prevent the entry  ofnew data or changes to 
existing data
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  subject or receives updated data 
on a previousl y reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken 
off-line, the site can report this informatio n on a paper SAE form or to the assigned 
SAE contact b y telephone .
Contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page.

12512.5. Appendix 5 Reproduction
12.5.1. Females of Non -Reproductive Potenti al and Females of 
Reproductive Potential
A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by  a 
negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, is not planning 
on becoming pregnant during the stud y and at least one of the following conditions 
applies:
Non-reproductive potential defined as:
Pre-menopausal females with one of the following:
Documented tubal ligation
Documented h ysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow -up 
confirmation of bilater al tubal occlusion 
Hysterectom y
Documented Bilateral Oophorectom y
Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an 
appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, >45 y ears, in the absence of 
hormone replacement therap y).In ques tionable cases for women <60 y ears of 
age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone and 
estradiol falling into the central laboratory ’s postmenopausal reference range is 
confirmatory .  Females under 60 years of age, who a re on HRT and whose 
menopausal status is in doubt, are required to use a highl y effective method to 
avoid pregnancy if they  wish to continue their HRT during the stud y.  
Otherwise, they  must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post -
menopausal status prior to study  enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 
to 4weeks will elapse between the cessation of therap y and the blood draw; this 
interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.  Following confirmation of 
their post -menopausal status, subjects can resume use o f HRT during the study  
without use of a highl y effective method to avoid pregnancy .
Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified 
List of Highl y Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of 
Reproductive Pot ential (FRP) (see Section 12.5.2 )from the screening visit until after 
the last dose of study  medication and completion of the follow -up visit.
12.5.2. List of Highly  Effective Methods for A voiding Pregnancy  in 
Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP)
The list does not apply  to FR P with same sex partners or for subjects who are and will 
continue to be abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent 
basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifest yle. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, 
ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.

1261.Contraceptive subdermal implant
2.Intrauterine device or intrauterine s ystem
3.Combined estrogen and progesto gen oral cont raceptive [ Hatcher 2011])
4.Injectable progestogen [ Hatcher 2011]
5.Cont raceptive vaginal ring [ Hatcher 2011]
6.Percutaneous contraceptive patches [ Hatcher 2011]
7.Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female 
subject's entry  into the study , and this male is the sole pa rtner for that subject 
[Hatcher 2011]. The documentation on male sterility  can come from the s ite 
personnel’s: review of subject’s medical records, medical examination and/or semen 
analysis, or medical history  interview provided b y her or her partner.
These allowed methods of contraception are only  effective when used consistently , 
correctly  and in accordance with the product label. The Investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that subjects understand how to properl y use these methods of contraception.
12.5.3. Collection of Pregnancy  Information
Investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any  female subject, who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to GSK within 2 
weeks of learning of a subject's pregnancy .
Subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnan cy. The 
Investigator will collect follow up information on mother and infant, which will be 
forwarded to GSK.  Generall y, follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks bey ond the estimated delivery  date. 
Any termination of pregnancy  will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or
SAE.
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such.  
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study  pregnancy  which is considered 
reasonabl y related to the study  treatment by  the Investigator , will be reported to GS K 
as described in Appendix 4 . While the Investigator is not obligated to actively  seek 
this information in former study  participants, he or she may  learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.
Any female subject who becomes pregnan t while participating in the study will 
immediately discontinue study medication.

to maintenance asthma medications during the 6 weeks immediatel y prior to 
Visit 0 (including no changes to a stable total dose of ICS of >250 mcg/day  
fluticasone proprionate [FP, or equivalent]).
Examples of acceptable doses of commonly  prescribed I CS and LABA or 
ICS/LABA combination medication is provided in the Study  Reference Manual 
(SRM).  Dosing regimen (once or twice dail y to equal the total daily dose) 
should be restricted to the current local product labels.

[GINA 2016] Study  Reference Manual (SRM) .  Dosing r egimen (once or twice 
daily  to equal the total daily  dose) should be restricted to the current local 
product labels /treatment guidelines .
Rationale: The criteria requires that, in the 6 weeks immediately  prior to Visit 
0, there be no change to a stable total dose of ICS of >250 m cg/day  FP (or 
equivalent) but there is no minimum total daily  dose of LABA specified; 
therefore, onl y acceptable doses of commonl y prescribed ICS (not LABA) need 
to be provided. The SRM references the GINA 2016 guidelines for accept able 
doses of commonly  prescribed I CS medication so a direct reference to the 
GINA 2016 guidelines has been provided in the protocol.

The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual subject
to determine eligibility  for and discontinuation from the study .  This 
formula may  not be changed or substituted once the subject has been 
enrolled.
For example, if a subject is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB (QT 
interval corrected for heart rate b y Bazett’s formula ), then QTcB must be 
used for discontinuation of this individual subject as well.
Once the QT corr ection formula has been chosen for a subject’s 
eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that subject for 
all QTc data being collected for data analysis .  Safety  ECGs and other 
non-protocol specified ECGs are an exception.  
The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate 
electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5-10 minute) recording 
period.
For this study , the following QTc stopping criteria will apply :
QTcF>500 msec or uncorrected QT>600 msec
Bundle branch b lock: QTcF 530 msec
Change from baseline: QTcF> 60msec

Rationale: The total daily  dose of the study -provided FP (to be used temporaril y 
to treat the s ymptoms of a moderate asthma exa cerbation) is at the Investigator’s 
discretion; therefore it is not appropriate to specify that FP should be administered 
twice dail y (i.e. BID). In addition, a statement has been included to indicate that

comparisons for the primary  efficacy  endpoint between triple therapy  and dual 
therap y at high dose of UMEC 62.5 mcg are significant at 0.05 level for both 
fixed FF doses, then the replicate efficacy  of UMEC 62.5mcg is demonstrated, 
and the defined treatment comparison between triple therap y and dual therapy  
will be test for the key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint on moderat e/severe asthma 
exacerbation based on the combined data of both FF doses . If the test for the 
key secondary  efficacy  endpoint is significant at 0.05 level, then the above 
testing hierarch y for the primary  and the key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints will 
be re peated for the low dose of UMEC 31.25 mcg. 
The famil y-wise Ty pe I Error is strongl y controlled at 0.05 level for the 
primary  endpoint (trough FEV1) and the key  secondary  endpoint 
(moderate/severe asthma exacerbations) for the UMEC 62.5 mcg dose.  
In addi tion, for a given UMEC dose, the secondary  endpoints ( Mean change

Changed to:
A step -down closed testing approach will be applied for the primary efficacy

comparisons for the primary  efficacy  endpoint between triple therapy  and dual 
therap y atthehigh dose of UMEC 62.5 mcg are statistically significant at the
0.05 level for both fixed FF doses (100 and 200mcg) , then the replicate

Week 24) will be tested sequentially based on the combined data of both FF 
doses for UMEC 62.5mcg at significance level 0.05 .the above testing 
hierarch y for the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
repeated for the low dose of UMEC 31.25 mcg.
If all tests mentioned above for UMEC 62.5 mcg are statistically significant 
at the 0.05 level, the above testing hierarchy for the primary efficacy 
endpoint,  the key secondary efficacy endpoint, and the secondary efficacy 
endpoints SGRQ and ACQ -7 will be repeated for the low dose of UMEC 
31.25 mcg.
If all tests for the primary, the ke y secondary, and the secondary efficacy 
endpoints for SGRQ and ACQ -7 are statistically significant at the 0.05 level 
for both UMEC 62.5mcg and 31.25mcg, the secondary endpoint for E -RS 
(Mean change from baseline in E -RS score over the Weeks 21 -24 (inclusiv e) 
of the treatment period) will be tested at the significance level 0.05 for UMEC 
62.5 and UMEC 31.25 in sequence.
The famil y-wise Ty pe I Error is strongl y controlled at 0.05 level for both 
UMEC 62.5mcg and UMEC 31.25mcg on the primary  endpoint (trough FE V1)

Changed from:
The date that the whole study  will complete (henceforth referred to as the study  
completion date) will be determined based on the randomization date of the 
final subject in the study ; the study  completion date will be set at 181 days (i.e. 
25 weeks and 6 day s) post the final subject’s randomization date. The study  
treatment cut -off date for all ongoing subjects will then be set at 11 days (i.e. 1 
week and 4 day s) prior to the study  completion date. The study  sites will be 
notified in advance to inform all ongoing subjects of the study  treatment cut -off 
date and the stud y completion date.
Once the stud y treatment cut -off and stud y completion dates are determined, 
ongoing subjects must continue to adhere to their pre -planned study  visit 
schedule; however, the on -treatment clinic assessment visit that is scheduled to 
occur before but closest to the study  treatment cut -off date (without 
consid eration of available visit time-windows) will be defined as the subject’s 
final treatment/EOS visit.  The subject’s final treatment/EOS visit must include

The date that the whole study  will complete (henceforth referred to as t he study  
completion date) will be determined based on the randomization date of the 
final subject in the study ; the study  completion date will be set at 181 day s(i.e. 
25 weeks and 6 day s)post the final subject’s randomization date. The study 
treatment cu t-off date for all ongoing subjects will then be set at 11 day s (i.e. 1 
week and 4 day s) prior to the study  completion date. The study  sites will be 
notified in advance to inform all ongoing subjects of the study  treatment cut -off 
date and the stud y comple tion date.
To determine when the final treatment/EOS visit will occur for each 
randomized subject in this variable duration study (i.e. at Week 24, Week 36 
or Week 52 of the treatment period), a date henceforth referred to as the 
transition date will be co mmunicated to the study sites by GSK. GSK will 
2016N271022_05 CONFIDENTIA L

175communicate a provisional transition date to all study sites on an ongoing 
basis during the study, until a fixed actual transition date is communicated at 
least 20 weeks in advance of the selected date (unless extenuating
circumstances dictate otherwise). The date selected by GSK as the actual 
transition date will always be more than 12 days prior to the study completion 
date. At the Investigator’s discretion, subjects should be informed of the 
transition date (provisional and actual) on an ongoing basis during the study 
so that their expected final treatment/EOS visit can be planned using the 
provisional transition date and then confirmed once the actual transition date 
is known.
Subjects who complete 52 weeks of study treatment prior to the actual 
transition date being communicated will have their final treatment/EOS visit 
at their Week 52 clinic assessment visit.
Once the stud y treatment cut -off and stud y completion dates are determined, 
ongoing subjects must continue to adhere to their pre -planned study  visit 
schedule; however, the on -treatment clinic assessment visit that is scheduled to 
occur before but closest to the study  treatment cut -off date (without 
consideration of available visit time -windows) will b e defined as the subject’s 
final treatment/EOS visit.  The subject’s final treatment/EOS visit must include 
all assessments specified for Visit 8/EOS. 
After the actual transition date is communicated, subjects must adhere to 
their study visit schedule and complete a minimum of 24 weeks of study 
treatment. A subject’s final treatment/EOS visit will be defined as follows:
–Subjects whose Week 24 clinic assessment visit is scheduled to 
occur on or after the actual transition date (without 
consideration of avai lable visit time -windows) will have their 
final treatment/EOS visit at their Week 24 clinic assessment 
visit. 
–Subjects who have their Week 24, Week 36 or Week 52 clinic 
assessment visit scheduled to occur before the actual transition 
date (without conside ration of available visit time -windows) 
will have their final treatment/EOS visit at the clinic 
assessment visit that is scheduled to occur before but closest to 
the actual transition date (without consideration of available 
visit time -windows).
The subjec t’s final treatment/EOS visit must include all assessments specified 
for Visit 8/EOS.
Rationale: The protocol is being amended to base the variable treatment 
period on the planned recruitment rather than the date of the last subject 
randomized. This align s planned exposure more closely  with actual exposure

At the Investigator’s discretion, prov ision will be made from Visit 11 onwards 
for subjects to temporarily receive fluticasone propionate (FP 100 mcg [or 
equivalent]) via DISKUS DPI to treat the symptoms of a moderate asthma 
exacerbation (see Section 6.9.1.1 and Secti on 7.3.6.1). Treatment start and stop 
dates will be recorded in the eCRF.  
1Note: Should the subject use the provided  FP prior to randomization at Visit 3, 
the enrolment or randomization concom itant medication exclusion criteria 
would be met (see Section 5.3.2 and Section 5.4.2). 
FP will be sourced from local commercial  stock; if not available locally, GSK

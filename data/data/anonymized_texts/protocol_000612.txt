2.0 Background
2.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the United States and 
Western Hemisphere. Nearly two-thirds of patients with CLL are over 60 years of age, and the prevalence of this disease should parallel the steady increase in the population over 50 years of age. Interest in newer therapeutic agents has been poor until recently due partly to the usual advanced age of patients and often indolent course of disease. However, the natural history is diverse. Patients with lymphocytosis only (Rai stage 0) have a median survival in excess of 10 years; those with evidence of marrow failure manifested by anemia (Rai stage III) or thrombocytopenia (Rai stage IV) have a median survival in excess of only 2 years. The National Cancer Institute Working Group on CLL has described clinical features of “active disease” which should be helpful in the decision to treat: 1) weight loss of > 10% body weight over the past 6 months; 2) fever or night sweats in the absence of infection; 3) extreme fatigue; 4) worsening anemia or thrombocytopenia; 5) massive (> 6cm below the left costal margin) or progressive splenomegaly; 6) massive (> 10cm in the longest diameter) or progressive lymphadenopathy; 7) progressive lymphocytosis with rapid lymphocyte doubling time; 8) marked hypogammaglobulinemia or paraproteinemia [1].
The mainstay of therapy has been systemic chemotherapy consisting usually of an alkylator and 
a corticosteroid. Chlorambucil plus prednisone has been the standard initial therapy with response rates from 40-77%. Fewer than 15% of these responses have been complete [2-6]. Therapy in patients who are refractory to alkylating agents is unsatisfactory. The response rates are substantially lower (approximately 30%) with rare complete responses [3, 7-9].
Fludarabine has shown marked activity in several indolent lymphoproliferative disorders, 
including CLL, low-grade lymphoma, macroglobulinemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia [10-14]. Fludarabine administration in previously treated CLL patients has resulted in a 13% complete response rate and 44% partial response rate [10]. Fludarabine has also been given to patients with previously untreated CLL, resulting in even higher response rates with 33% complete response and 50% partial response [11].
Despite attainment of clinical complete response, most patients experience a recurrence at a 
median of approximately 2 years [15]. This is likely related to the fact that most patients in complete remission have residual disease that can be assessed by several parameters. In previously untreated patients, 55% of CR patients have residual nodules on bone marrow biopsy (nPR). At 2 years, 87% of CR patients are progresson-free, versus 55% of nCR patients [15].
Cyclophosphamide has been combined with vincristine (VCR) and prednisone (COP) to treat 
2005-0106
January 9, 2014
Page 3
lymphoproliferative disorders. Liepman and Votaw first reported on this combination to treat CLL 
in 1978. Thirty-six patients received this regimen, 23 were previously untreated. The response rate was 72%; 18 of 23 (78%) previously untreated patients responded; 8 of 13 (62%) patients previously receiving chlorambucil responded to COP [16]. Oken and Kaplan treated 18 patients with CLL with CVP (cyclophosphamide 800mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 or 400mg/m2 orally for 5 days, VCR 2mg i.v. on day 1 and prednisone 60-100mg/m2 on days 1-5). All patients were previously treated and 17 of 18 were refractory to chlorambucil. The response rate was 44% [17].
Two randomized trials have been performed. The French Cooperative Group on CLL randomized 
291 patients to daily chlorambucil (0.1 mg/kg) or COP, where the cyclophosphamide dose is 300mg/m2 orally on days 1-5. The response rate with chlorambucil was 59%, and with COP was 61% [18]. ECOG randomized the same COP regimen versus chlorambucil (30mg/m2 orally day 1) and prednisone (80mg orally days 1-5). The response rate for COP was 82% and 72% for chlorambucil and prednisone. Median duration of response and survival were also similar [19]. In all these studies, toxicity was minimal and generally related to myelosuppression in a significantly immunocompromised group. However, VCR in CLL is questionable with two single agent trials reporting no activity in a small number of patients [20].
Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) has now been used in 128 patients with CLL at MDACC 
[21]. Thirty-four of these patients received FC as initial therapy. FC produced  80% overall response rate in all patients not refractory to fludarabine at the start of therapy as well as a 38% response rate in patients who were refractory to fludarabine. The CR rate was 35% in previously untreated patients, which was not significantly different from the CR rate in historical control patients treated with single-agent fludarabine. However, residual disease assessed by flow cytometry occurred in only 8% of previously untreated patients achieving CR, and median time to progression has not been reached after a meaidan follow up of 41 months. The FC combination thus seems to have a significant advantage over single-agent fludarabine in the salvage setting. Although the CR rate was not increased in previously untreated patients, residual disease detected by flow cytometry was rare and remission durations seemed to be prolonged in this subset.
2.2 Monoclonal Antibodies in CLL
Monoclonal antibodies have expanded the therapeutic possibilities for patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Rituximab has been studied extensively in low-grade lymphomas. One hundred sixty-six patients with advanced stage low-grade or follicular lymphoma were enrolled in the pivotal phase II portion of the study [22]. Rituximab was administered at a dose level of 375mg/m2 once weekly for four weeks. There were 105 males and 61 females with a median age of 58 years (range, 22-79) and 40% of patients were over 60 years of age. All patients had relapsed with a median of 3 (range, 1-7) prior chemotherapy regimens. Of the 166 patients, 161 completed all four infusions. Side effects (chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, headaches) were usually mild to moderate and associated with the first Rituximab infusion. The mean half-life of free (serum) antibody was 1.8 days following the first dose and 6.2 days following the fourth infusion. Quantifiable immunoreactivity (HAMA or HACA) was not observed. There were 80 responders (10 CRs and 70 PRs); a response rate of 48% (95% CI: 41-56%). The median time to onset of response was 50 days (range, 21-288 days). The median duration of response has not been reached after 9.2 months (range, 1.9 to 18.8+ months). The response rate in 23 patients previously treated with ABMT was 78% compared with a 43% response rate in patients who had not undergone ABMT. The response rate in patients with SLL (WDLL), the tissue counterpart of CLL, was only 12%.
Whereas Rituximab has been studied extensively in low grade lymphoma, fewer studies have 
been undertaken in CLL, and with less success at standard dose and schedule. To improve response rates, we have undertaken a dose escalation study with all patients receiving rituximab 375mg/m2 on the first course of therapy and each week thereafter receiving doses ranging from 500mg/m2 up to 2250 mg/m2 per day [23]. No unusual toxicity occurred after the first infusion. 
2005-0106
January 9, 2014
Page 4
The response rate is 41% in 23 of 30 CLL patients evaluated and 50% in all patients treated. 
Higher doses have a higher response rate. In a similar dose escalation study, rituximab was given at 375mg/m2 i.v. three times weekly for 4 weeks [24]. Although dose increases were observed compared to the standard dose of rituximab, dose escalation trials have also highlighted the limitations of that approach: 1) financial considerations; 2) limited increase in response rates with moderately elevated doses; 3) dependence of response on antigen density and anatomic disease site; and 4) no improvement of responses in fludarabine-refractory patients.
Preclinical studies suggested synergistic activity of rituximab with chemotherapy agents including 
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. We have conducted a phase II study of rituximab combined with fludarabine and cyclosphosphamide (FCR) for advanced or progressive CLL as well as initial therapy [25, 26]. One hundred and thirty-five previously untreated patients were treated. Using NCI WG criteria, 67% obtained a CR, 14% of the patients achieved a nodular partial remission (nPR), and 14% a partial response (PR). Eight-five (63%) of patients evaluated were able to obtain a flow cytometry remission with < 1% CD5/CD19 co-expressing cells and 41 (55%) of 74 patients tested were able to become PCR negative for immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement in their bone marrow. Marrow PCR negativity was more common in those with CR (59%) compared with nPR (44%) and PR (50%) patients. The FCR regimen was well tolerated with grade 3-4 neutropenia being the most common toxicity being present in 56% of courses. The same combination has been used in previously treated patients with CLL. In a preliminary analysis, of 102 patients 23% achieved CR, 14% nPR, and 36% for an overall response rate of 72%. Five of 13 patients (38%) in CR had undetectable IgH rearrangements by PCR. These results and others confirm that chemo-immunotherapy combinations are very active and appear to achieve far superior results compared to chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody therapy alone. 
2.3 Mitoxantrone in the treatment of CLL
Mitoxantrone has been used frequently in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders including CLL. We have previoulsly conducted a phase II study of fludarabine plus mitoxantrone in 88 patients with CLL [27]. Fludarabine was administered at 30mg/m2 i.v. daily for 3 days and mitoxantrone at 10mg/m2 on day 1. The OR was 66%. The response was 83% in previously untreated patients, 87% in patients previously treated with alkylating agents, 50% in patients whose disease was not refractory to fludarabine at the start of therapy, and 25% in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL. The median progression-free survival was 24 months for all patients and 34 months for previously untreated patients. Experience with FC and mitoxantrone has been published in relapsed and refractory CLL [28]. Of 60 patients, 37 received fludarabine at 25mg/m2 i.v. day 1-3, cyclophosphamide at 200mg/m2 i.v. day 1-3, and mitoxantrone 6mg/m2 i.v. on day 1, at 4-week intervals for up to six courses. Twenty-three patients received FCM with cyclophosphamide at 600mg/m2 i.v. and mitoxantrone 8mg/m2 i.v. Overall, 50% of the patients achieved CR including 10 cases with molecular responses as assessed by PCR testing. Twenty-eight percent achieved PR for an overall response of 78%. FCM thus induced a high CR rate, including a significant number of patients with molecular responses in patients with previously treated CLL.
Given the positive experience with rituximab chemotherapy combinations, we propose to 
combine FCM with rituximab in patients with previously untreated CLL. There is extensive experience with these drugs in CLL although not with this particular combination. The FCM-R regimen is being explored in other low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders and mantle cell lymphoma. We do not expect any unusual toxicities. We propose this protocol for younger patients with good prognosis markers (beta-2-microglobulin </= 4 mg/dL) for the following reasons: i) chemoimmunotherapy results are more favorable in this age group than in patients over age 70 for whom alternative programs are being developed; ii) beta-2-microglobulin has emerged as an important prognostic marker in our FCR experience; iii) the addition of mitoxantrone to FCR is not a radical change in the overall rationale of FCR and good prognosis patients may benefit more from it than poor prognosis patients who again demonstrate an inferior

response and survival to the FCR; and iv) alternative programs are being developed for poor 
prognosis patients (based on beta-2-microglobulin levels). 
2.4 Pegfilgrastim
Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta™) is a covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human G-CSF(Filgrastim) and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol.  Filgrastim is a lineage-specific hematopoietic growth factor that preferentially stimulates the growth and differentiation of neutrophil precursors and the function of mature neutrophils.   
Pegfilgrastim is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile 
neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.  For information on preclinical and toxicology studies, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.
Pegfilgrastim was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, active-control studies, using 
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered every 21 days for up to 4 cycles of the treatment of high risk and metastatic breast cancer.  Study 1 investigated the utility of a fixed dose of pegfilgrastim. Study 2 used a weight-adjusted dose.  In the absence of growth factor support, similar chemotherapy regimens have been reported to result in a 100% incidence of severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) with a mean duration of 5 to 7 days, and a 30 to 40% incidence of febrile neutropenia.
In study 1, 157 subjects were randomized to receive a single SC dose of 6 mg of pegfilgrastim on 
day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle or filgrastim 5 mg/kg/day SC beginning on day 2 of each cycle.  In study 2, 310 subjects were randomized to receive a single SC injection of pegfilgrastim at 100 m/kg on day 2 or filgrastim 5 mg/kg/day SC beginning on day 2 of each cycle of chemotherapy.  Both studies met the primary objective of demonstrating that the mean days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) of pegfilgrastim-treated patients did not exceed that of filgrastim-treated patients by more than 1 day in cycle 1 of chemotherapy.  The rates of febrile neutropenia in the 2 studies were comparable for pegfilgrastim and filgrastim (in the range of 10% to 20%).  Other secondary endpoints included days of severe neutropenia in cycles 2 to 4, the depth of ANC nadir in cycles 1 to 4, and the time to ANC recovery after nadir.  In both studies, the results for the secondary endpoints were similar between the two treatment groups.
Pegfilgrastim 6 mg will be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once per cycle 
following the end of chemotherapy.
3.0 Background Drug Information
3.1 Fludarabine
3.1.1 Supply:  Sterile, 50 mg prepared as a white lyophilized powder with sodium hydroxide to adjust 
pH.3.1.2 Solution Preparation:
 Fludarabine for injection should be prepared for parenteral use by 
aseptically adding Sterile Water for Injection USP. When reconstituted with 2mL of Sterile Water 
for Injection, USP, the solid cake should fully dissolve in 15 seconds or less; each mL of the resulting solution will contain 25 mg of fludarabine phosphate, 25 mg of mannitol, and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to 7.7. The pH range for the final product is 7.2 – 8.2. In clinical studies, the product has been diluted in 100 cc or 125 cc of 5% Dextrose Injection USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP.Reconstituted Fludara for Injection contains no antimicrobial preservative and thus should be used within 8 hours of reconstitution. Care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and

discoloration prior to administration.
3.1.3 Handling and Disposal: Procedures for proper handling and disposal should be considered.  
Consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for 
cytotoxic drugs. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.  
Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of Fludara for Injection solution. The 
use of latex gloves and safety glasses is recommended to avoid exposure in case of breakage of the vial or other accidental spillage. If the solution contacts the skin or mucous membrane, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Avoid exposure by inhalation or by direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes.  
3.1.4 Stability:
 Fludarabine phosphate is relatively stable in aqueous solution. Over a pH range of 
approximately 4.5 to 8 in aqueous buffer solutions stored at 65C, approximately 11% decomposition occurred in one day. From this pH profile, the optimum pH was determined to be approximately 7.7. At concentration of 25 mg/ml in distilled water stored at room temperature in normal laboratory light, fludarabine phosphate exhibited less than 20% decomposition in 16 days.
Diluted to concentration of 1 mg/ml in 5% dextrose injection, USP, or in 0.9 sodium chloride 
injection, USP, less than 3% decomposition occurred in 16 days at room temperature under normal laboratory light.
CAUTION:
 The single-use lyophilized dosage form contains no antibacterial preservatives.  
Therefore, it is advised that the reconstituted product be discarded eight hours after 
reconstitution.
3.1.4 Route of Administration:  Intravenous.
3.2 Cyclophosphamide:
3.2.1 Formulation:  Cyclophosphamide is available as powder for injection in vials of 100 mg, 200 mg,

CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER RITUXIMAB AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS !
Rituximab will be given on days 1 at a dose of 375mg/m2 during course 1 and on day 1 at a dose 
of 500mg/m2 during courses 2-6.   
Recommended premedication: 500 to 1000 mg of acetaminophen orally and 12.5 to 25 mg of 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride orally or intravenously to be administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to starting each infusion of Rituximab.
Rituximab may be administered via a peripheral or central intravenous line.During the Rituximab infusion, the patient’s vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) should be 
monitored every 30 minutes times one hour or until stable and then hourly until the infusion is discontinued. Assessment of temperature and respiration as clinically mandated. Available at the bedside prior to Rituximab administration will be epinephrine for subcutaneous or i.v. injection, diphenhydramine hydrochloride for intravenous injection, and resuscitation equipment for emergency management of anaphylactoid reactions.
The initial dose rate at the time of the first Rituximab infusion should be 50 mg/hr for the first 
hour. If no toxicity is seen, the dose rate may be escalated gradually to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. If the first dose of Rituximab is well tolerated, the starting flow rate for the administration of the subsequent doses may be 100 mg/hour and then increased gradually not to exceed 400 mg/hour.Rituximab is associated with hypersensitivity reactions (hypotension, bronchospasm, or angioedema), which may respond to adjustments in the infusion rate. Transient fever and rigors may occur. Rituximab should be interrupted for severe reactions and resumed at a lower rate until symptoms have completely resolved. Supportive care such as IV saline, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen should be available and instituted as clinically mandated.  Upon resolution of all side effects and in the judgment of the investigator, the patient’s dose may be gradually escalated to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hour.  
Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. 
Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of Rituximab. Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions including arrhythmias and angina have had recurrences of these events during Rituximab therapy and should be monitored closely. Consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medications the day of the first infusion, since transient hypotension may occur.
Rate reductions of up to 50% should occur for: (1) fever > 38.5
oC, (2) mild to moderate rigors, (3) 
mild to moderate mucosal congestion/edema, (4) > 30 mm Hg decrease over baseline in systolic 
blood pressure, or (5) other reaction according to the judgment of the investigator. 
Courses will be repeated every 28 to 42 days (+/- 7 days) depending on recovery of peripheral 
blood counts and toxicities for a maximum of 6 courses. Patients will be evaluated for response after 3 and 6 courses. Patients will be taken off study after 3 courses for progressive disease, but are otherwise allowed to complete 6 courses. 
5.3 Dose adjustments
All previously experienced treatment-related toxicities should have recovered to at least grade 1 (exception: alopecia, lymphopenia, fatigue, weakness, nausea/vomiting that can be controlled with supportive care measures) by the time the next course is started. Dose adjustments (one level reduction, see table below) will be made for any  grade 3 treatment-related toxicities during the preceding course (exception: alopecia, lymphopenia, fatigue, weakness, nausea/vomiting that can be controlled with supportive care measures or infusion-related toxicities that may occur with

platelet count should be >/= 60 x 109/L and/or the ANC >/= 1 x 109/L prior to continuation. For 
patients whose platelets are < 100 x 109/L or ANC < 1 x 109/L at the start of therapy, blood counts 
should at least have recovered to within 20% of pretreatment baseline levels prior to starting the 
next course. If recovery of the platelet count or ANC either to the level of prior to therapy or the parameters above exceeds 42 days, the dose will be decreased by 1 level.

 If subsequent courses cannot be administered within 3 weeks following day 42 of therapy because of treatment-related toxicities, doses should be reduced by at least one level regardless of recovery of these toxicities to  grade 1.
Carriers of hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV 
infection and for signs of hepatitis throughout their study participation.
5.4 Concomitant Medications/Therapy
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout the study as determined by the treating physician and the patient’s medical need. No concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or therapy with other monoclonal antibodies except for rituximab will be allowed during the study. Investigational agents that are not used for the treatment of the leukemia per se (e.g. anti-infective prophylaxis or therapy) will be allowed.
Use of erythropoietin is at the discretion of the treating physician and is permitted if judged in the 
patient’s best medical interest. Use of G-CSF of GM-CSF should be discussed with the principal investigator.
Prophylactic antibiotics and antiviral agents are recommended (e.g. trimethoprim 
sulfamethoxazole, valacyclovir); however, the use of these or other drugs will be left to the treating physician’s discretion.

products may become necessary. 
5.5.1 Rituximab:No dose-limiting effects were observed in the Phase I/II studies.  Reported adverse events 
including fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, and mild hypotension, occurred primarily during rituximab infusions and typically responded to an interruption of the infusion and resumption at a slower rate.  Other adverse events included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, other hematologic events, cardiac and cardiopulmonary events, and tumor lysis syndrome. 
Hematologic Events:   In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of 
patients treated with rituximab; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia 
(4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days).  A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following Rituximab therapy were reported. 
In addition, there have been a limited number of postmarketing reports of prolonged 
pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia (defined as occurring 40 days after the last dose of rituximab) in patients with hematologic malignancies.  In reported cases of late onset neutropenia (NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4), the median duration of neutropenia was 10 days (range 3 to 148 days).  Documented resolution of the neutropenia was described in approximately one-half of the reported cases; of those with documented recovery, approximately half received growth factor support.  In the remaining cases, information on resolution was not provided.  More than half of the reported cases of delayed onset neutropenia occurred in patients who had undergone a prior autologous bone marrow transplantation.  In an adequately designed, controlled, clinical trial, the reported incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in patients receiving rituximab in combination with fludarabine as compared to those receiving fludarabine alone (76% [39/51] vs. 39% [21/53]).
Cardiac Events:   Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmia and angina, 
have had recurrences of these cardiac events during rituximab infusions.Cardiopulmonary Events:   In rare cases, severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including 
hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, and 
cardiogenic shock, have occurred (4-7/10,000 patients or 0.04-0.07%.)  Nearly all fatal infusion-related events occurred in association with the first infusion.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome:   Although rare, tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in 
postmarketing studies and is characterized in patients with a high number of circulating malignant 
cells (>25,000 ul) by rapid reduction in tumor volume, renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
Hepatitis B Reactivation:  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic 
failure, and death has been reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with 
rituximab.  The majority of patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately four months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately one month after the last dose.
Renal Events:   Rituximab has been associated with severe renal toxicity including acute renal 
failure requiring dialysis, and in some cases has lead to death.  Renal toxicity has occurred in 
patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (>25,000/mm2 ) or high tumor burden who experience tumor lysis syndrome.  
Mucocutaneous Reactions:   Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases of toxic 
2005-0106

Page 12
epidermal necrolysis, have been reported rarely in patients treated with rituximab.  
Paraneoplastic pemphigus has been reported very rarely in NHL and CLL patients undergoing chemotherapy plus rituximab treatment.  The onset of reaction has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following rituximab exposure. 
Additional Safety Signals:   The following immune serious adverse events have been reported 
to occur rarely (<0.1%) in patients following completion of rituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders 
of blood vessels (vasculitis, serum sickness and lupus-like syndrome), lung disorders including pleuritis and scarring of the lung (bronchiolitis obliterans), eye disorders (uveitis and optic neuritis), and severe bullous skin reactions (including toxic epidermal necrolysis and pemphgus) that may result in fatal outcomes.  Patients may have these symptoms alone or in combination with rash and polyarthritis
See the rituximab Investigator Brochure for additional details regarding safety experience with 
rituximab.
5.5.2 Cyclophosphamide:
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and/or loss of appetite. Electrolyte abnormalities. Cystitis. 
Cyclophosphamide may cause a metallic taste immediately after it is given. Mucositis, gastritis, and/or temporary alopecia. It may cause headache, dizziness, stuffy nose, and/or testicular shrinkage. It may also cause loss of menstrual periods and/or allergic reaction.
5.5.3 Fludarabine:Loss of appetite, fatigue, confusion, numbness, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Fatigue and 
weakness. Vision and/or hearing problems. Neurotoxicity (inlcuding seizures and coma). Skin rash, mucositis/stomatitis and/or alopecia. Congestive heart failure, pulmonary fibrosis, hematuria. Hepatotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity. Sterility (may be permanent).
5.5.4 Mitoxantrone:Loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Mucositis/stomatitis. 
Alopecia. Hepatotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity. Sterility (may be permanent).
5.5.5 Pegfigrastim:Pain, burning, swelling, bleeding/bruising, or infection at the injection site. It may generate bone 
pain for which pain medications are sometimes required.

10.0 Evaluation of Toxicity
Toxicities will be reported according to NCI CTC Version 3 (NCI-CTCAE). See Appendix B for details.
11.0 Reporting Requirements
See Appendix A and F (Leukemia) for Reporting Requirements
In the event of an adverse event, the first concern will be for the safety of the subject.  Investigators are 
required to report to Genentech Drug Safety any serious adverse event , whether expected  or 
unexpected , regardless of causality to either rituximab.  All events meeting these criteria will be reported 
for the time period beginning with any amount of exposure to rituximab through the protocol-defined 
follow-up period.  Serious criteria, definitions, and guidance for reporting follow.
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in an 
investigational trial or protocol regardless of causality assessment.  An adverse event can be an 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or disease associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
Serious adverse events  (SAE)  are adverse events occurring at any dose which meet one or more of the 
following serious criteria :
· Results in death  (i.e. the AE caused or lead to death)
· Is life-threatening  (i.e. the AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death; it does not apply to an AE 
which hypothetically might have caused the death if it were more severe)· Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization  (i.e. the AE required at least a 24-hour inpatient 
hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay; hospitalizations for 
elective medical/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAEs by this criterion)
2005-0106
January 9, 2014
Page 16
· Is disabling  (i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions)
· Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject exposed 
to the trial drug prior to conception or during pregnancy)· It does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject  and may require 
medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
SAEs include any sign, symptom or medical condition that meets any of the above criteria and emerges 
during rituximab treatment or during a post-treatment follow-up period that (1) was not present at the start of treatment and is not a chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical history, OR (2) was present at the start of treatment or as part of the patient’s medical history but worsened in severity and/or frequency during therapy.
Expected  adverse events are those adverse events that are listed  or characterized in the current 
Investigator Brochure. Unexpected  adverse events are those not listed  in the current Investigator Brochure or not identified.  
This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in 
the Investigator Brochure  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the Investigator Brochure only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Associated with Rituximab
All serious adverse events (SAEs) regardless of causality to rituximab (this applies to both expected and 
unexpected events) should be recorded on a MedWatch 3500A Form (Appendix J) and faxed to:
Genentech Drug Safety 
Tel: (888) 835-2555Fax: (650) 225-4682 or (650) 225-4683
AND:
The Principal Investigator of the Study and the IRB
MedWatch 3500A Reporting Guidelines:
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication information, the report 
should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500A form:
· Treatment regimen (dosing frequency, combination therapy)
· Protocol description (and number, if assigned)· Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known· Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics· Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to each investigational product and suspect medication
Follow-up information:  
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by any of the following methods:
· Adding to the original MedWatch 3500A report and submitting it as follow-up
· Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow-up with the original MedWatch 
2005-0106
January 9, 2014
Page 17
3500A form 
· Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including subject identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, subject number), protocol description and number, if assigned, suspect drug, brief adverse event description, and notation that additional or follow-up information is being submitted  (The patient identifiers are important so that the new information is added to the correct initial report)
Occasionally Genentech may contact the reporter for additional information, clarification, or current status 
of the subject for whom and adverse event was reported.  For questions regarding SAE reporting, you may contact the Genentech Drug Safety representative noted above.
Study Drug Relationship:
The investigator will determine which events are associated with the use of the study drugs.  For 
reporting purposes, an AE should be regarded as  possibly related to the use of the investigational 
product if the investigator
 believes:
· There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and rituximab administration; 
and/or· There is a biologically plausible mechanism for rituximab causing or contributing to the AE; and· The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or procedures.
12.0 Statistical Considerations
This is a phase II study with an objective of determining the clinical response rate in CLL patients treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and rituximab (FCM-R).  Eligible patients will be previously 
untreated, < 70 years of age and have a favorable Beta-2-microglobulin level of 
≤ 4mg/dL.  The addition of 
mitoxantrone to the regimen is expected to favorably affect patient response.  In addition to the FCM-R 
regimen, patients will receive Neulasta to shorten the duration of neutropenia and reduce the infection rate.  
Patients will receive a maximum of 6 courses of therapy, with courses repeated every 28 – 42 days ( ± 7 
days).  The maximum total sample size will be 30 patients, with accrual estimated to be 2-5 per month.
A previous phase II clinical trial of patients with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) resulted 
in an overall response rate at 6 months of approximately 95%.  In addition to overall response, flow cytometry was measured at 3 months and at 6 months after the start of treatment.  The phase II FCR trial found that 
patients who maintain a flow cytometry <1% have better survival than those whose flow cytometry is 
≥ 1%.  
Therefore, examining the flow cytometry at 3 months is a useful tool for early assessment of the later 
outcome of survival.
The method of Thall, Simon, and Estey (1996), will be employed to perform interim efficacy and safety 
monitoring.  The patient outcomes of interest are F = [patients who have a flow cytometry < 1% at 3 months] and N = [grade III-IV neutropenia during 3 months after start of treatment].  We will denote the probability of F 
for the patients treated with FCR by 
θS, F and for the experimental therapy, FCM-R patients by 
θE, F.  Similarly, we will denote the probability of N for the patients treated with FCR by θS, N and for 
experimental FCM-R therapy patients by θE, N.
Historical data is from a phase II trial of 189 previously untreated patients treated with FCR.  
(Beta-2-microglobulin levels were not considered in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.)  The FCR trial found that 34.4% of the patients had a flow cytometry < 1% at 3 months and 74.6% of the patients had grade III-IV neutropenia.  Thus the historical data suggest the probability of a flow cytometry <1% at 3 months to be 
θS, F =65/189 (34.4%), and we assume that θS, F ~ beta(65, 124).  We assume θE, F ~ beta (1.37, 2.62).  This 
distribution has the same mean (0.344) but a larger variance than the standard therapy counterpart.  The data from the FCR trial also suggest an estimate of the probability of grade III-IV neutropenia within the first 3 
2005-0106
January 9, 2014
Page 18
months to be θS, N = 141/189 (74.6%) and we assume that θS, N ~ beta(141/48).  We assume θE, N ~ beta(2.98, 
1.02).  This distribution has the same mean (0.746) but a larger variance than the standard therapy 
counterpart.
The goal of the trial is to achieve an increase in patients with favorable flow cytometry to 50%, an increase of 
approximately 15%, while not allowing the neutropenia rate to increase.  At most 30 patients will be treated.  We will begin monitoring after 10 patients have been enrolled and then monitor continuously.  However, we will not suspend accrual to wait for patients to be evaluated.
Our monitoring rules for these two endpoints are described below:Flow Cytometry <1% at 3 months
Pr[ θS, F + 0.15 <  θE, F | data ] ≤ 0.01
That is, if at any time during the trial we determine that we have less than a 1% chance of showing that the 
average rate of patients with flow cytometry <1% at 3 months is at least 15% higher than would be expected on the standard of care (i.e. 35%) we will stop the study.  Stopping boundaries corresponding to this probability criterion are to terminate the trial if
(# of patients with Flow Cytometry <1% at 3 months) / (# patients evaluated)
 
≤ 1/11, 2/14, 3/17, 4/20, 5/23, 6/26, 7/29.
Grade III-IV Neutropenia
Pr[ θS, N <  θE, N | data ]  ≥ 0.99
That is, if at any time during the study we determine that there is more than a 99% chance that the average rate of grade III-IV neutropenia is more than would be expected on the standard of care (i.e. 75%) we will stop the study.  Stopping boundaries corresponding to this probability criterion are to terminate the trial if
(# patients with grade III-IV neutropenia) / (# patients evaluated)  
≥ 14/14, 15/15, 16/16, 17/17, 18/18, 19/19, 20/20, 21/22, 22/23, 23/24, 24/25, 25/26, 26/27, 27/29.
The operating characteristics of this study design are illustrated in Table 1.

In addition to flow cytometry at 3 months we will also determine the flow cytometry at 6 months and present it 
along with its corresponding 95% credible interval.  The secondary objectives include determining the molecular response rate, time to treatment failure, and toxicity profile of FCM-R.  Molecular response rate will be defined as the percentage of patients who have a negative result by PCR testing for IgH gene rearrangements and will be presented along with its corresponding 95% credible interval.  Time to treatment failure will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.  Patients who experience a relapse or die will be considered to be a treatment failure event.  Patients who are alive without relapse at their last follow-up will be considered as censored.  Finally, descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages will be used to summarize the occurrence of any toxicities.

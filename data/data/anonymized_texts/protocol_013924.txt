 1. Introduction to the Personal Resilience Empowerment Program 
(PREP) at Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health & Medicine  
 
The Personal Resilience Empowerment Program ( PREP ) at Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health & 
Medicine is designed to assist patients in preparing for a planned hospital admission for a surgery or 
procedure. The program offers classes  and personal sessions where the patient, with the  support of an 
Integra tive Health Coach ( Registered Nurse), is introduced to new life skills that will help him or her 
during their hospital experience and beyond in everyday life.  
Using evidence -based tools derived from our Five Pillars of Health & Well -Being (Sleep, Activity,  
Purpose,  Nutrition, and Resilience), the patient learns how to :  
■ Acquire mind -body skills to assist in stress management  
■ Learn to thrive by building resilience  
■ Feel empowered to manage  their own  health  
■ Gain self -care skills to decrease anxiety, p ain, and nausea naturally  
■ Control the stress response and trigger the relaxation response to promote well -being  
■ Discover what foods fuel the body in preparation for healing, during recovery, and overall health  
The goal is for the patient to leave the coaching sessions feeling empowered to use new tools to elicit 
the relaxation response or build on resiliency practices they may already use.  
The program is led by integrative health coaches/registered nurses who will help to facilitate and 
motivate the pa tient to make positive choices for overall health and wellness. They educate and support 
group members to achieve their goals through lifestyle and behavior adjustments. Health coaching 
brings together several disciplines including sleep, activity, purpose , nutrition, resilience. There is no 
cost for the class . 
2. Introduction to the PREP project  
 
The PREP at Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health & Medicine was designed in Legacy Meridian to 
assist all selected patients with upcoming hospitalization. For the “Personal Resilience Empowerment 
Program (PREP) in the perioperative setting of surgically treated cancer patients ”, hereafter “the Project  
or PREP ”, the Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health & Medicine is designing a new pilot program to 
focus on the nee ds of oncology patients.   
All patients diagnosed with cancer that will undergo a scheduled surgical (Hepato -Biliary , and Thoracic ) 
procedure in Hackensack Meridian Health and specifically in the Jersey Shore University Medical Center, 
will be eligible to participate (for more details please see eligibility criteria, section 4).  
Overall, this pilot  project will include 5 coaching sessions  and a n introductory session/visit that will take 
place on the physician’s office . The initial  physician visit will focus on patient eligibility, introduction to 
5 
 the Project, informed consent and a pre -intervention survey and will be conducted by   the principal  
investigator or one of the sub -investigators listed above . The  following 5 sessions will be conducted by 
one of the integrative health coaches/registered nurses  (for details please see section 5). A post -
intervention survey will be completed during the fi nal session  and repeated at one month, and at 3 
months from the final session .  
The goal of this project is to investigate whether using the PREP as an intervention in patients diagnosed 
with cancer would result in improving various metrics including impro vements to  resilience, sleep, 
activity, purpose, nutrition,  empowerment to manage one’s own health and well -being,  decrease in pain 
medication use and more rapid return to previous functional status  according to Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group  (ECOG ).  
3. Study Purpose and Objectives  
 
3.1. Purpose of the study    
This is a pilot study designed to assess the effectiveness of the Personal Resilience Empowerment 
Program (PREP) in supporting surgical oncology patients before, during  and after  their hospitalization .  
 
3.2. Primary objectives   
The primary objective of this project is to determine if an increase in knowledge and awareness through 
coaching sessions improves quality of life by empowering the person to manage one’s own health in the 
application of skills related  to our 5 pillars of Health and Wellbeing. (sleep, activity, purpose, nutrition, 
resilience) in oncology patients.  
 
3.3. Primary and Secondary Endpoints   
Measurements of health related quality of life, slee p, activity, purpose, nutrition, resilience  and  
empowerment to manage one’s own health and well -being   at 1 month and  3 months from final session . 
Also pain, use of pain medication and return to work -more rapid return to previous pre -operative 
functional status according to ECOG.  In addition, record th e number of times (if any) that  nurse coaches 
are called for support outside  of the protocol .

 4. Study Participants  
 
4.1. Study population  
All patients who will undergo a scheduled surgical , thoracic (lung),  hepato -biliary (cholangiocarcinoma , 
pancreatic, liver) procedure in Hackensack Meridian Health at Jersey Shore University Medical Center 
that meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in this project.  
Initial contact with potential participants will take place at each surg eon’s office and every surgeon 
listed as investigator/sub -investigator in this protocol will present the study to his/her patients and will 
consent them.  
 
4.2. Number of participants  
This project is a pilot to assess the effectiveness of the PREP to support on cology patients before, during 
and after their hospitalization   
Five to six new patients are seen on a weekly basis in the  physician practices . We plan to run this project 
for 3 months, therefore taking into consideration patients’ willingness to participate and complete all 
sessions and the number of potential losses during follow -up, we estimate that we will include 30 -40 
patients but no more than 50 patients .  
4.3. Selection Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria  
1. 18 years of age and older  
2. Patients diagnosed with  cancer of the thoracic (lung) , hepatobiliary system 
(cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, liver)   that will undergo a scheduled surgical procedure at

 5. Study Design  
5.1. Study Overview  
This is a pilot study designed to assess the effectiveness of the PREP in supporting surgical oncology 
patients before, during , and after  their hospitalization .   
The project includes 5 sessions  with a RN Health Coach . The overview of the study is summarized in 
table 1 below. The initial pre-operative physician visit  will focus on patient eligibility, introduction to the 
Project, informed consent and a pre -intervention survey and will be conducted by  oncology surgeon or 
physician assistant . The remaining sessions will be conducted by one of the integrative health 
coaches/registered nurses. A post -intervention survey will be completed during the final session.  
In addition to the basic demographics being collected, the fol lowing clinical information will also be 
collected for every patient across multiple time points : AJCC cancer stage, occurrence of chronic pain (if 
applicable), pain  level (using a scale 0-10), pain medication usage (yes/ no), pain medication type used 
(prescription or over the counter), and pain medication dosage and frequency for each pain medicine 
listed (where applicable).   
The goal of this project is to investigate whether using the PREP as an intervention in patients diagnosed 
with cancer would result  in improving various metrics including improvements to  health related quality 
of life, sleep, activity, purpose, nutrition, resilience, and empowerment to manage one’s own health and 
well-being , decrease in pain medication use and more rapid return to pre vious functional status.  
For details about each session and what will be covered please see below (section 5.4.).

5.4. Study visits / sessions   
As described earlier, this project will include one initial visit focusing on patient eligibility, study 
presentation and informed consent followed by 5 coaching sessions that will take place either in -person 
or over the phone.  
The initial visit will be c onducted by one of the oncology surgeons listed as investigators in this protocol, 
while the coaching sessions will be conducted by one of the Nurse Health Coaches from Integrative 
Health & Medicine .  
Attendance  and the duration of each session  will be rec orded in a Word document .  
5.4.1.  Research Eligibility  
The research eligibility will take place in the office of each one of the surgeons listed in this protocol. 
Following consent based on research eligibility,  all participants will complete the  pre-interventio n 
survey.  
More specifically, the surgeon will present the study using the script presented below.  
The Personal Resilience Empowerment Program (PREP) will assist you in preparing for your 
upcoming hospital admission. You will learn and practice skills that you can use beyond your 
surgery or procedure in your everyday life. We look at this health event as an opportunity to 
examine your lifestyle choices and build your awareness of the mind/body connection so you can 
become empowered to manage your own he alth. You will be contacted by telephone by a 
Registered Nurse (RN) health coach to schedule a n in-person  group coaching and telephone 
coaching session within one week of this consent. During the group session, you will be introduced 
to our five pillars of  health and well -being: sleep, activity, purpose, nutrition and resilience. 
Following the group session and prior to your surgery, you will have a phone call with the nurse 
health coach. In this phone call, the RN health coach will  reinforce our five pilla rs of health and 
well-being and discuss how you and the coach will partner throughout this process. In total, you 
will meet with the nurse health coach five times -first during a group coaching class, and then 
session 2 will be a phone coaching session with in one week prior to your surgical admission, 
session 3 will be in person hospital coaching session, session 4 will be a phone coaching session 
within one week of discharge and the fifth session  will be in person at your post -operative hospital 
visit .  Our goal is to assist you in developing resilience skills that can help you bounce back and 
9 
 assist you in managing stress, reducing potential pain and empowering you to improve your 
quality of life.  
Patients that are interested in taking part in the study wil l be then consented by the surgeon  or another 
member of the study team and will be notified of the study procedures (upcoming 5 sessions) . They will 
be asked to provide their contact details including their email and a contact number.  
To facilitate the in formation and engagement process, the surgeon will also provide enrolled patients 
with the “The Personal Resilience Empowerment Program (PREP) flyer ”. 
At the end of the information process, the surgeon will notify patient that the  Registered  Nurse - Health  
Coach will contact them to schedule the initial group session  within one week and telephone session  to 
be completed prior to surgery.  
Finally, patients will be asked to fill the pre -intervention survey at the end of the session. Participants 
will be provi ded with hardcopies of the surveys and data collected will then be transferred to a database 
created specifically for this project in Excel.  
After the end of the  research eligibility visit , the nurse coach will receive a spreadsheet of patients 
enrolled i n the study by the physician office following consent   
5.4.2.  First session  
The first session is a group coaching class prior to surgery. After an overall presentation of the program, 
the class will focus on introducing the 5 pillars of health and well -being: sleep, activity, purpose, 
nutrition and resilience. Several handouts will be provided for patients to take home and use between 
sessions. All handouts and the PowerPoint presentation for this session will be submitte d to the IRB for 
approval.  
This is a 90 minute class held at Jersey Shore University Medical Center. During the g roup PREP class , 
participants will learn how to acquire mind -body skills to assist in stress management, learn to thrive by 
building resilienc e, feel empowered to manage their health, gain self -care skills to decrease anxiety, pain 
and nausea naturally, control the stress response and trigger the relaxation response to promote well -
being and discover what foods fuel the body in preparation for h ealing, during recovery and overall 
health.  
5.4.3.  Second session  
The second session will take place over the phone.  
During the second session, the nurse  coach  after a quick overview of the group session will focus on the  
coaching needs of the patient at that time. The coach will address  the readiness to change and will 
reinforce the skills taught in the group class.  
To facilitate the discussion and ensure consistency across patients, the nurse coach will use a script (see  
appendix 2).  
The call is expected to last approximately 30 minutes (but  not more than 60 minutes ). The total time of 
the session will be documented and recorded in the patient’s research file.  The nurse health coach will 
complete a health coach consult note in research file.  
10 
 5.4.4.  Third session  
The third session will be an i n-person hospital visit with the nurse health coach  and will  occur 3 -5 days 
following  the surgical procedure. The session will last 15 -30 minutes (but not more than 60 minutes).  
During the session, the nurse coac h will re -introduce the skills and he/she will practice those skills with 
the patient. To facilitate the discussion and ensure consistency across patients, the nurse coach will use 
a script (see appendix 3). The nurse health coac h will encourage and empower the patient to use these 
skills throughout the remainder of the stay and beyond. Coach will offer additional support as 
appropriate.  
In the end of the session, the nurse will remind the patient that they will receive a telepho ne call after 
discharge to schedule the fourth session over the phone. The patient will also be offered the 
opportunity to call the nurse -coach if they feel like they need additional support at any time throughout 
this program.  
5.4.5.  Fourth session  
The health c oach will be notified of the patients discharge date from the surgeon’s office and the health 
coach will contact the patient to schedule a telephone coaching session within one week of the 
discharge.  To facilitate the discussion and ensure consistency acro ss patients, the nurse coach will use a 
script (see appendix 4).  
The fo urth session will be over the phone and will last approximately 15-30 minutes (but not more than 
60 minutes). During the session, the nurse -coach will focus on the skills and will encou rage and empower 
the patient that these can be used for relaxation, stress management and to build and sustain resilience  
beyond the hospital experience . Coach will offer additional support as appropriate .  
5.4.5.  Fifth session  
Session 5 will be in -person and wi ll take place the same day as the follow -up doctor’s appointment  and 
will last 15 -30 minutes (but not more than 60 minutes).  
The nurse -coach will conclude the program, remind patient of the techniques learned and will also 
encourage and empower the patient  that these are life skills that can be used for relaxation, stress 
management and to build and sustain resilience. Coach will offer additional support as appropriate  after 
the end of the study. To facilitate the discussion and ensure consistency across pa tients, the nurse coach 
will use a script (see appendix 5 ). 
In the end of the final session, the patient will be asked to complete a hard copy of the exit survey (post -
intervention).  
5.4.6.  Follow -up 
Patients will be sent a  hard copy of the follow -up  survey to the address  they have provided at one and 
three months after discharge.

 6. Methods  
6.1. Survey  
All surveys used were created for this project. The majority of the questions are influenced by questions 
found in validated tools such as the CDC Quality of Life tool and have been adjusted to reflect the needs 
of oncology patients.  
6.1.1.  Survey Construction  
All instruments are novel and were developed solely for this project. Questions were developed through 
consultation with the investigator team, subject matter experts, and relevant literature.  
6.1.2.  Survey Administration  
The surveys will be administered during t he initial visit and at the last coaching session . Two more 
follow -up surveys will be sent to participants at one and three months after discharge. Participants will 
be provided with hardcopies of the surveys and data collected will then be transferred to a database 
created specifically for this project in Excel.  
6.2. Statistical Design  
The proposed study will be a descriptive case -series of thoracic and hepatobiliary oncology patients who 
are scheduled to undergo surgical intervention at Jersey Shore University  Medical Center, a hospital in 
the Hackensack Meridian Health Network, that will be enrolled in the Personal Resilience Empowerment 
Program (PREP).  
6.2.1 Sample Size  
The sample size proposed for this study is as many patients as can be recruited by the end  of March 
2018 or a maximum of 50 patients, whichever occurs first.  Given that this is a pilot study for the PREP 
initiative at Hackensack Meridian Health there is no existing data with which to calculate a precise 
sample size that would be needed to prov ide statistical power.  Therefore, we relied heavily upon the 
number of patients who could be approached during the study consent timeframe, with consideration 
for both potential drop -out and loss to follow -up, as well as the challenge of consenting patien ts in the 
first place, to determine the potential sample size.  
6.2.2 Planned Analyses  
6.2.2.1 Interim Analysis  
Due to the nature of the study design, there is no interim analysis planned.  
6.2.2.2 Analysis Methods  
Continuous measures and outcomes will firs t be summarized using minimum, maximum, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and interquartile range, while categorical and ordinal measures will first be 
summarized using frequencies and percentages. For any patient measure that can be described as a 
time to  an event, the median time will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier procedure with the 
standard error being estimated by the Greenwood formula.  
In order to detect significant changes in the longitudinal repeated measurements from the pre - and 
post -interven tion patient survey, McNemar or Stewart -Maxwell tests will be used for categorical 
measures while Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests will be used for ordinal measures. Any continuous measures 
12 
 will be compared using either a paired T -Test or a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test depending on the outcome 
of the Shapiro -Wilk test of normality.  
In addition, a cancer stage stratified analysis is currently planned. The normality of each continuous 
measure will first be tested using the Shapiro -Wilk test.  Given that the variable c an be considered 
normal ly distributed , either a T -test or an ANOVA test will be used to  compare the continuous measure  
between the stage  groups , dependent upon how many stages are represented in the patient sample.  
However, if  the measure  cannot be considered normally distributed, then the Wilcoxon rank sum test  or 
Kruskal -Wallis test  will be used instead.  For all categorical variables, we  will first consider using the 
Pearson’s Chi -Square test.  However, if any expected frequency within the contingency table is less than 
5 then the Fisher’s exact test will be used.  For any ordinal variables with more than 2  potential 
outcome s the Wilcoxon rank sum test  or Kruskal -Wallis test will be used . 
A two -sided p -value will be reported for each tes t result using a potential Type 1 error of α = 0.05.  Any 
p-value shown to be less than α will be considered statistically significant.  As necessary, graphical 
representations of results will be provided.  
6.2.3 Data Relevance  
The data elements being colle cted are both clinical and patient self -reported measures.  The clinical 
aspects that are proposed will allow the study team to better ascertain the patients’ health condition 
pre-operatively and post -operatively during the most critical timeframes for pre paration and recovery, 
respectively.  These pieces of information are vital in being able to describe the study population and 
understand the clinical experience of the participants. Whereas the self -reported measures that are 
proposed for collection, via surveys, will provide the study team with more of an understanding of the 
patients’ awareness of the effects of the 5 Pillars (Activity, Nutrition, Sleep, Purpose, and Resilience), as 
well as their feelings towards making changes in their life based on the  PREP coaching process.  
Additionally, the follow -up surveys will allow the team to gain information from the patient on how they 
are recovering as well as how they can improve PREP for future patient participants.  
6.2.4 Data Coding  
6.2.4.1 Data De -identification  
All study data will be de -identified prior to analysis by assigning a unique and generic study identifier to 
each patient upon enrollment into the study.  This assigned number will not contain or be linked to any 
personal he alth identifiers (PHI). A coded list containing the matching information between the generic 
study identifier and the true identity of the patient will be kept on a Hackensack Meridian Health 
password protected network computer and will not be shared with the study biostatistician or anyone 
else performing data analyses.    
6.2.4.1 Data Element Coding  
All clinical study data will be recorded as it is written in the patient chart, lab test report, or pathology 
report.  However, we may later create or recode  measures that indicate the presence or the lack of 
presence of something specific pre - or post -operatively as 0 (not present) and 1 (present). This could 
include the presence of certain comorbidities that may affect the coaching process or surgical outcom es. 
For coaching follow -up notes and survey data, the responses that are requested from the patient are 
largely from a 0 – 5 Likert Scale (with some written explanation) and will be coded as such. For any 
13 
 questions that elicit an affirmative response (i.e. : yes) or a negative response (i.e.: no) the measures will 
also be coded as a 0 or 1.  
6.2.5 Data Analysis Tools  
Data collection and storage will be performed using Microsoft Work and Microsoft Excel. All documents 
will be saved in password protected comput ers only accessible to the study team.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using:  
1. SAS software Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute Inc. [2012], Cary NC, 
USA. URL www.SAS.com  ) 
2. R language for  statistical computing (R Core Team [2017].  R: A language and environment for 
statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL http://www.R -

 Appendix 2 – Handout and Script for Session No 2  
 
Session 2 - Phone call within one week prior to surgical admission with nurse health coach (at least 30, 
not more than 60 minutes)  
“Hi my name is ______ and I am a Registered Nurse Health C oach. We will partner throughout 
this process to help you bounce back and assist you in managing stress, reducing potential pain 
and empowering you to improve your quality of life . Today, in our second session, we will 
review th e skills from the group clas s and I will provide you with support around the skills. In the 
class, you learned the five pillars of health and well -being that can support you to manage your 
upcoming surgery. These are life skills which you can apply during your upcoming hospital 
admis sion and beyond your hospital experience. To begin, let’s look at your pain, anxiety and 
well-being. How would you rate your pain right now from 0 -10 with 0 being no pain and 10 
being the worst pain? How about your anxiety level from 0 -10? If 0 is no anxie ty and 10 is severe 
anxiety, how would you rate how you feel right now? How about your sense of well -being?  
From 0 -10 with 0 meaning not well and 10 being well, what number would you rate yourself 
right now?  
We are now going to discuss the five pillars of  health and well -being by looking at the Mind Body 
Spirt reference guide which  you received at the PREP group coaching class . Let’s start by 
discussing your sleep which is e ssential for the body to heal, repair, and prepare for the next 
day. How are you sleeping? [Coach will offer support as appropriate]  
Our next pillar is activity. Activity is more than exercise; it includes your movement throughout 
the day. Movement is important for your body but it is also important for your mind. When y ou 
move, chemicals are released which improve your emotions and your brain function. What is 
your current activity level? Has your doctor given you any restrictions on your activity?  [Coach 
will offer support as appropriate]  
Our third pillar is purpose. Pu rpose is where you find meaning in your life; it’s what gets you out 
of bed in the morning. When we are clear on our values, strengths and our sense of purpose, it 
can help serve as an anchor in tough times. Sometimes when we experience challenges such as 
a health event, it is a time where we re -examine our purpose. We can apply this to the purpose 
for your upcoming admission, or beyond to your greater life purpose. I would encourage you in 
the time before your surgery and in our future sessions to reflect on your purpose. [Coach wi ll 
offer support as appropriate]  
 
Our fourth pillar, nutrition, is the fuel for our mind and body. You can refer to the food that 
increase and decrease inflammation sheet that was provided to you.  How is your nutrition 
intake?   In general, foods like breads, pastas, dairy, processed meats, red meats, soy oil, corn 
oils, fast and fried food, and soft drinks and sugary beverages turn on inflammation in our body. 
Inflammation over time can lead to disease. The food choices you make n ow can help you in 
preparation for your wound healing and your body’s natural response to surgery. By choosing to 
eat things like nuts, avocados, spinach, tart cherries, pineapple, orange vegetables and fruit, and 
18 
 
turmeric, onion, ginger and garlic you can  help your body to heal faster since these foods 
decrease inflammation and promote healing. [Coach will offer support as appropriate]  
 
The fifth pillar is resilience which is the ability to cope and bounce back in difficult times. How do 
you currently hand le/manage your stress? [Coach will offer support as appropriate]  To 
counteract your stress response, we are going to practice skills that can create balance in your 
body and  mind. We are going to practice  the 4 -7-8 breathing technique which you learned in the 
group PREP class that will help relax you.  
 
The key to doing this exercise properly is to ensure that your exhalation is twice as long as your 
inhalation.  Let’s take out the 4 -7-8 breathing card now. [The nurse health coach will guide the 
patient thro ugh the following exercise]:  
1. Sit or lie comfortably with your back straight.  
2. Place the tip of your tongue against the ridge of tissue just behind your upper front teeth and 
keep it there throughout the entire exercise.  
3. Exhale completely through yo ur mouth.  
4. Close your mouth lightly and inhale through your nose quietly to a count of 4.  
5. Hold your breath for a count of 7.  
6. Exhale audibly through your mouth for a count of 8.  
7. Repeat steps 4 -6 three more times for a total of four breath cycles.  
8. Breathe normally and observe how your body feels.  
Try using this twice per day and any other time you want to relax your body and mind. You can 
use this if you are experiencing pain or anticipating pain. It may also help calm your mind prior 
to sleep. By focusing on your breath, you can allow your mind to settle down and rest.  
 
Next  we will practice  using the pressure point l ocated on your inner forearm between the two tendons.  
Apply firm pressure to this area on the inside of your wrist to help with nausea and/or vomiting from: 
upset stomach, motion sickness, chemotherapy or after surgery due to the effects of anesthesia.  
  
 
 
Step 1 : Find the point, three finger widths from base of wrist.  
 

19 
 Step 2 : Now feel the center of the two tendons with the index finger. Apply pressure with your pointer 
finger. It is common to feel a dull aching sensation at the point.  Stimulate this point with moderate to 
firm pressure with your fingert ips in a circular motion and repeat the movement on each wrist for at 
least 30 seconds and up to 2 minutes. The treatment can be used as often as needed. Once you know 
the location of the point, some people find it is easier to use their thumb to apply the  pressure.  
 
Make sure to ask your health care provider exactly how to use these mind -body techniques.  
 
Please remember our  third session will be in -person in your hospital room midway during your hospital 
stay. At this time we will check in with your pain,  anxiety and well -being and practice the skills we 
discuss ed in this call in addition to other coac hing support you may need. Our fourth session will take 
place over the phone within one week of your discharge. I will call you once I’m notified that you ha ve 
been discharged to schedule a phone coaching session within one week. At this session we will discuss 
the transition of the skills you learned and used in the hospital to your everyday life. I will check in again 
on your pain, anxiety and well -being and  offer additional support as needed.  The final session will be in 
person at your first post -operative doctor visit. I will meet you in the office for a coaching session at this 
time to review the skills you have learned, and check in on your pain, anxiety  and well -being. You will 
also be requested to complete a program evaluation and follow -up survey. If you feel like you need 
additional support at any time throughout this program, you can call me at ______________.

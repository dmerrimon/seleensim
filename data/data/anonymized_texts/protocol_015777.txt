SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA011001
Protocol Title: A Phase I/IIa Trial with BMS-986158, a S mall Molecule Inhibitor of the Bromodomain and Extra-
Terminal (BET) Proteins, as Monotherapy or i n Combination with Nivolumab in Sub jects with Selected Advanced 
Solid Tumors or Hematologic Malignancies
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Du ration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s) : BMS-986158 is  formulated as a hard gelatin capsule 
 to be administered by oral route. Nivolumab is formulated as a solution for injection. 
Part 1 (BMS-986158 monotherapy dose escalation with Schedules A, B, and C en rolling at different dosing 
schedules, See Figure 1). Schedule A enrolled first. Each subject in Schedules A, B and C is administered a single 
dose of BMS -986158 on Cycle  1 Day 1 and no additional doses are a dministered until Cycle 2 Day 1. For subjects in 
Schedule A on Cy cle 2 Day 1, which must be within approximately 7 days of the Cycle  1 Day 1 dose administration, 
and on eac h subsequent cycle, subjects receive on ce daily dosin g for 5 consecutive days of each week, followed by a 
2-day rest period, on a 28-day cycle. For subjects in Schedule B  on Cycle 2 Day 1, which must be within a pproximately
7 days of the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose administration, and on each subs equent cycle, subjects receive once daily dosing for 
14 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day rest period, on a 21-d ay cycle. For subjects i n Schedule C on Cycle 2 Day 1, 
which must be with in approximately 7 days of the  Cycle 1 Day  1 dose administration, and on each subsequent cycle , 
subjects receive once d aily dosing for 7 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day rest p eriod, on a 21-day cycle. In 
Part 1, the continuous dosing Schedule A enrolled first. Subjects ma y continue to receive treatment in all 3 dose 
schedules until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events (AEs) or withdrawal of consent.Part 2 expansion (BMS-986158 monotherapy and/or in combination therapy with nivolum ab, See Figure 1). In 
Part 2, Schedule A (QD dosing for 5 consecutive days on with 2 d ays off each week of a 28-day cycle) for BMS-
986158 administra tion has been s elected for expansion of  the 4.5 mg dose, wh ich will be administ ered for 2 weeks 
(10 doses) followed by 3.75 mg for the r emainder of the treatment period, as agreed upon between the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators considering safety, PK  data generated 
during Part 1. This dosing and schedule will be evaluated for up to 2 years in adult and adolescent subjects. Adults 
and adolescent subjects weighing ≥40 kg will be administered a flat dose of BMS-986158. Using Schedule A and a 
dosage of 4.5 m g for a 2-week loading period followed by 3.75 mg f or the remainder of the treatment period, BMS-
986158 will be tested as monotherapy and potentially in combina tion with nivolumab. If pursued, nivolumab will be 
administered as a flat dose of 480 mg Q4W. Adolescent subjects wil l receive nivolumab at 6 mg/kg up to a maximum 
of 480 mg for Schedule A with the same frequency of administratio n as adults.
Study Phase:  Phase I/IIa
Research Hypothesis : There is no formal pr imary research hypothesis for this study to be s tatistically tested. It is 
anticipated 
that BMS-986158 as monot herapy and/or in combination with nivolumab (i pursued) will demonstrate 
adequate safety and tolerability at pharmacologically relevant doses, so as to permit further clinical development (at 
a recommended dose range).
Objectives:  
Primary
•To assess the safety and tolerability and to assess the dose li miting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BMS-986158 as mono therapy for sub jects with selected 
advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
•If combination with nivolumab is pursued, to assess the safety and tolerability at the RP2D of BMS-986158 in 
combination with nivolumab and to assess the DLT for subjects wi th advanced solid tumors and hematologic 
malignancies.
Secondary•To assess the preliminary an titumor activity  of BMS-986158 mono therapy and, if pursued, in combination with 
nivolumab as measured by objective response rate (ORR), and res ponse duration based on response evaluation

criteria in solid tumors using criteria from RECIST v1.1, prost ate cancers using PCWG3 criteria, or hematologic 
malignancies using criteria from Lugano 2014.
•To characterize pharmacokinetics of BMS-986158 and metabolite i n monotherapy and, if pursued, in combination 
with nivolumab.
•To assess the dose-response and exposure-response effect of BMS -986158 monot herapy on the ECG (QT 
interval).
Study Design:  This is a Phase I/IIa, open-label study of BMS-986158 administe red as monotherapy and, if pursued,
in combination with nivolumab  to subjects with selected advanced  solid tumors and he matologic malignancies. The 
study will be conducted in two parts: a dose escalation phase ( Part 1 ) and a dose expansion phase ( Part 2 ). Schematics
of the study are provided in Figure 1 andFigure 2 .

Figure 2: Expansion Cohorts
Part 1 consists of the dose escalation phase with BMS-986158 administered  as monotherapy.
Part 2 consists of cohort expansions in solid tumors and hematologic ma lignancies (BMS-986158 monotherapy and 
potentially in combination with nivolumab). Treatment in Part 2  will be initiated when the MTD or maximum 
administered dose (MAD) if no MTD is reached and dose schedule(s ) from Part 1 has been determined. Schedule A 
(QD dosing for 5 consecutive days of each week, followed by a 2 -day rest period, on a 28-day cycle) has been chosen 
for expansion after starting with 4.5 mg for a 2-week loading pe riod (5 days on/2 days off) followed by the same 
schedule at a reduced dose level of 3.75 mg for all sub jects. The schedule and dosage were chosen based on safety, 
PK  data generated during Part 1.
Part 1: Selection of Dose Levels
The first cohort of subjects in Schedule A received a starting do se level of 0.75 mg daily for 5 consecutive days per 
week beginning at Cycle 2. Dose escalation for each subsequent cohort of subjects is guided by the incidence of AEs 
for which no clear alternative cause is identified, as graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03) in t he first 32-35 days of dosing (DLT evaluation 
period) of Schedule A, and the first 35 days of dosing (DLT evalu ation period) of Schedules B and C. Dose escalation 
will be in increments of 100% above the previous dose level unt il the first occurrence of any of the follo wing toxicities 
that have no alternate cause: any DLT (as described in Section 4.5.1 ), any ≥Grade 2 toxicities with the following 
exceptions: Grade 2 fatigue, Grade 2 alopecia. 
Once one or more of the above identified DLTs occurs, a modified  Fibonacci dose escalation schema will be employed 
for any subsequent dose escalations at that schedule, with incre ments of 67%, 50%, 40%, and 33%. Any further dose 
escalations will be  33%. In a ddition, dose modif ication could also include change s in the dosing interval (e.g. twice 
weekly), based on available safety and PK data.Intermediate dose levels may be  evaluated if agreed upon by the S ponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators. The next 
dose level will not exceed 100% of the prior dose level or the dose increment per the modifi ed Fibonacci dose 
escalation schema.
Part 1: Dose Escalation Decision Rules
Enrollment in dose escalation and selection of the maximum tole rated dose (MTD) will adhere to a modified Toxicity 
Probability Interval (mTPI) design. The design provides a simple algorithm for decisions on escalation, expanding at 
the same dose level, and de-escalation, depending on the number of observed toxicities af ter each dose level c ohort 
(see Figure 3). The mTPI method utilizes a target toxicity (DLT) rate and eq uivalence interval (EI) to guide decisions 
on escalation after each cohort and to estimate the MTD. For th is study the target DLT rate is 27% and the EI is 
25%-29%.

BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
Dose escalation decisions starting with the first dose cohort w ill be guided by the cumulative number of subjects who 
are DLT evaluable and who experience a DLT in the DLT evaluation  period for all arms (Figure 3). If no DLTs are 
observed in the first dose cohort, 3-4 subjects will be enrolled  at the next dose level. If 1 DLT is observed in 3 or 4 
evaluable subjects, this dose level will be expanded by enrollin g another cohort of 3-4 at the same dose level. If 2 of 
3 or 3 of 4 subjects are observed with DLTs, the next cohort will  be enrolled at the lower dose level. Additional 
decisions are shown in Figure 3. If a decision to treat more sub jects at a given dose level is suggested by the mTPI 
algorithm when there are already at least 13 DLT evaluable subj ects treated at the same dose level, a need for further 
enrollment in the dose escalation phase will be determined by th e Sponsor. These same rules will be applied to 
Schedules B and C. A total of approximately 30 DLT evaluable subj ects is expected to be treated per schedule with a 
total of 90 planned across schedules for the dose escalation phase.
Decisions to escalate, add more subjects to the current dose lev el, de-escalate (with options to re-escalate), or de-
escalate and declare the current dose as unacceptable (exceedin g the MTD), will be based on the rate of DLTs in 
evaluable subjects within the 32 to 35-day DLT evaluation period  for Part 1 Schedule A and within the 35-day DLT 
evaluation period for Part 1 Schedules B and C. At least 3 DLT-eva luable subjects treated at each dose level are 
required to enable a decision. To account for subjects who may n ot be able to complete the DLT evaluation period, 
for reasons other than a DLT, or may not be evaluable for DLT, a fourth subject may be e nrolled at this dose level, 
following agreement between the investigator and Sponsor/Medica l Monitor. Subjects must receive at least 16 of the 
21 planned doses in Schedule A of Part 1, 17 of the 22 planned dos es in Schedule B of Part 1, or 12 of the 15 planned 
doses in Schedule C of Part 1, during the DLT evaluation period to  be considered evaluable for dose escalation 
decisions. Subjects who developed a DLT during the DLT period a re considered evaluable regardless of the number 
of received doses. Subjects with insufficient data to establish  safety during the DLT evaluation period at the dose level
tested may be replaced upon agreement of the Sponsor/Medical Mo nitor and investigators.
There will be no intras ubject dose escalation of BM S-986158.
Figure 3 shows examples of scenarios guiding decisions that may be encountered during dose escalation with respect 
to the number of DLT evaluable subjects and the number of subje cts with a DLT. In addition to escalation or expansion 
decisions, dose re-escalation is permitted as per Figure 3 after  a decision to de-escalate is made, except when a dose 
level has been identified as exceeding the MTD. Therefore, a do se level could be revisited multiple times under the 
mTPI design.

Part 1A: MTD Determination
At the end of dose escalation, the MTD or MAD for each evaluated dosing schedule (Schedules A, B, and C) will be 
selected as the dose with the smaller difference between estimat ed toxicity and the target DLT rate (27%), among the 
dose levels used, with an isotonic regression model of the accum ulated DLT data based on the mTPI design ( Appendix 
1).
Dose Limiting Toxicity for Part 1
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation decisions, DLTs are defined separately in Protocol Section 4.5.1 and will 
be determined based on the inciden ce, intensity, and duration of  AEs for which no clear alternative cause is identified. 
The DLT evaluation period will be within 32 to 35 days (depending o n the exact day of the start of Cycle 2) of in itiation 
of study therapy for Schedule A and 35 days for Schedules B and C in Part 1. The DLT period for safety assessment 
of BMS-986158 and nivolumab combination therapy in Part 2 will match the DLT period for the selected schedule in 
Part 1 (ie, 32 to 35 days for Schedule A and 35 days for Schedu les B and C). AEs w ill be graded according to NCI 
CTCAE v4.03. For the purposes of subject management, DLTs will lead to dose interruptions regardless of the cycle 
in which a DLT occurs. AEs occ urring after the above defined DL T evaluation period will be considered for the 
purposes of defining the RP2D, upon agreement between the Spons or/Medical Monitor and investigators, if they are 
determined to have no clear alternative cause and are not relat ed to disease progression.
Part 2: Dose Expansion
Treatment in Part 2 can be initiated before Part 1 is completed  and when the MTD, or maximum administered dose 
(MAD) if no MTD is reached for Part 1, has been determined. Sched ule A (QD dosing for 5 consecutive days of each 
week, followed by a 2-day rest period for a 28-day cycle) has b een chosen for dosing in expansion to be implemented 
as follows: The initial dose level of BMS-986158 selected for P art 2 is 4.5 mg with a loading period of 2 weeks
(10 doses or half a cycle) with subsequent lower dose of 3.75 mg  for the duration of study treatment for each subject.
Further dose modification at the subject level is permitted below the dose level of 3.75 mg depending on the observed 
toxicity and tolerability.
The dose and schedule were selected upon agreement between the S ponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators, 
considering safety, PK  data generated during Part 1. Adult and adolescent subjects 
weighing ≥40 kg will be administered a flat dose of BM S-986158. 
BMS-986158 w ill be evaluated in expansion as monotherapy; initially in up to 45 subjects with tumors harboring 
specific genetic alterations including fusion proteins (NUT-mid line carcinoma [NMC], double-hit lymphoma [DHL]), 
BRD amplifications (triple negative breast cancer [TNBC]), MYC amplifications (non-germinal center diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma [non-GC DLBCL]) and AR amplification (castrate resistant prostate cancer [CRPC]).  
 
 
 
Depending on the safety, 
preliminary efficacy, tolerability
in these initial cohorts, a subsequent set of monotherapy cohor ts in up to 
126 subjects with tumor types already evaluated in the initial e xpansion cohort as well additional tumor types within 
and across groups of specific genetic alterations may be enrolle d. Categories of genetic alterations and tumors under 
consideration for subsequent enrollment include fusion proteins  (NMC, DHL, Ewing sarcoma [ES] and Burkitt’s 
lymphoma [BL]), BRD amplifications  (triple negative breast cancer [TNBC], ovarian cancer [OC] and neuroendocrine 
prostate cancer [NEPC]), MYC amplifications (Non-GC DLBCL, uter ine carcinosarcoma [UCS], OC), AR 
amplification (CRPC) and mutations (renal cell carcinoma [RCC], non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] and uveal 
melanoma [UM]).The decision to assign new c ohorts of subjects  to BMS-986158 pl us nivolumab combination therapy will be made 
after review of preliminary eff icacy,  and other available data  obtained from both Initial and 
Subsequent 
monotherapy expansio n subjects upon agreemen t betwee n the Sponsor/Medical Monitor and 
investigators. If combination therapy of BMS-986158 and nivolum ab is pursued, sub jects may be enrolled with any 
of the tumors types listed in Figure 1.
In Part 2, subjects who have pr ogressive disease after receivin g BMS-986158 in combination with nivolumab may 
have the option of continuing on treatment with the combination , if combination therapy is pursued. Subjects who

have progressive disease after r eceiving BMS -986158 monot herapy will not have the option of continuing on 
treatment with BMS-986158 monotherapy or receiving BMS-986158 i n combination with of nivolumab.
Clinical safety monitoring of subjects treated with BMS-986158 monotherapy enrolled in Part 2 of the study will be 
the same as conducted during the dose escalation portion. Durin g Part 2, if in a given tumor cohort the combined 
incidence of study drug-related AEs that require dose modificat ion ex ceeds 29% (of treated sub jects), then further 
enrollment to that arm may be interrupted and the findings will  be discussed between the Sponsor/Medical Monitor 
and investigators. An agreement will be reached as to whether a  lower dose level or an alternate dose schedule of 
BMS-986158 should be examined, or whether any additional treatm ent guidelines should be implemented prior to 
enrollment of additional subjects on study.
If pursued, the safety of the selected BMS-986158 dose when giv en in combination with nivolumab within the dose 
expansion phase will be evaluated by monitoring DLTs in the firs t 6 to 12 subjects  treated across different tumor 
cohorts receiving combination therapy. The DLT period in Part 2 will be 28 days, which excludes a 7-day single dose 
period in Part 1 (Cycle 1) to allow appropriate co mparison. Once the selected do se of BMS-986158 in combination 
with nivolumab is deemed safe based on the DLT evaluation, the dose expansion will continue as planned in all 
cohorts. The guidance for assessing the DLT-related safety and overall safety w ill be s imilar to that used in the 
monotherapy cohorts. The DLT safety monitoring during the dose evaluation phase including potential decision to de-escalate to a lower dose will be based on the mTPI-2 design wit h target toxicity (DLT) rate of 29% (-2%, +4%).
Duration of Study: The overall duration of the study is expected to be approximately 4 years from the time of the first 
visit of the first subject to the required survival follow-up o f the last s ubject enro lled. Subjects may discontinue 
treatment due to disease progression, unacceptable AEs, or with drawal of consent. Depe ndent upon treatment, the 
Clinical Follow-up visits will occur approximately 30 days (for subjects who receive monotherapy) and 60 and 
100 days (for subjects who receive combination therapy) after the  subject discontinues study treatment. For subjects 
in partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) who discontinu e treatment for AEs, tumor assessments will be 
performed every 12 weeks for the first year then every 6 months  for the second year. If a sub ject discontinues treatment 
due to an AE, the subject should be seen in Clinical Follow-up every 30 days until the AEs either resolved to baseline
or Grade 1, stabilized, or been deemed irreversible. After completing the Clinical Follow-up Period, sub jects will 
continue on to a Survival Follow-up Period.  
 
 
The end of the study will occur after the last treated subject completes their Clinical Follow-up, unless 
if a subject discontinues prematurely.
Number of Subjects : The planned sample size cons ists of up to approximately 90 su bjects for Part 1 and up to 
approximately 327 subjects for Part 2 for a total of up to approximately 417 subjects in the entire study.Study Population: The study population will include adult men and women who are at least 18  years of age and 
adolescents ≥12 years of age who meet the st udy eligibility criteria. Adu lt subjects must ha ve histologic/cytologic 
confirmation of one  of the  following malignancies to be eligible: OC, TNBC, NSCLC, RCC, UM,  UCS, NEPC, CRPC, 
NMC, ES, BL, DHL, or non GC-DLBCL. Adolescent subjects must have  histologic/cytologic confirmation of NMC, 
ES, or BL. At least one (1) site of measurable disease as define d by RECIST v1.1 for solid tumors, Lugano 2014 
criteria 
for lymphomas, or PCWG3 for prostate cancers is mandato ry. Additionally, in order to be eligible for 
enrollment to Part 1 of the study, all subjects must have either  an archival tumor tissue block or at least twenty (20) 
unstained cut slides identified and available, and consent to provide this archival tissue. Acquisition of adequate pre-
treatment tumor tissue is  mandatory for adult subjects in this s tudy. Subjects who do not have archival tissue available 
may consent to a pre-treatment fresh tumor biopsy to be eligibl e for this study if it can be performed at acceptable 
clinical risk as judged by the  investigator and i f it does not include a target lesion or a lesion in an area treated with 
prior radiation therapy. All adult subjects enrolled in Part 2 must have tumor lesions that can be biopsied or collected 
via core needle at acceptable clinical risk (as judged by the investigator) at baseline (pre-treatment), during treatment, and end of treatment (EOT) in case of PD. 
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must not be nursing or pregnant and must be using an acceptable method 
of contraception for at least 4 weeks before dosing and for 5 months following the last dose of study  drug. WOCBP 
must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to dosing with study medication. Male participants who are 
sexually active with a WOCBP should also use an adequate method(s) of contraception, irrespective of vasectomy 
status or partner’s pregnancy status, for up to 7 months following the last dose of study drug.

Study Assessments:  
Safety Outcome Measures : AEs will be assessed continuously during the study and for 30 days after the last treatment
of BMS- 986158 monotherapy and 100 days post discontinuation of combination therapy. AEs will be coded using the 
most current version of MedDRA and reviewed for potential signi ficance and importance. AEs will be evaluated 
accordi ng to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. Sub jects s hould be followed un til all treatment related AEs have recovered to 
baseline, or are deemed irreversible by the investigator. Safet y assessments will be based on medical review of AE
reports and the results of vital sign measurements, ECGs, physi cal examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.
Efficacy Measures: Disease assessment with computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
(solid tumors and lymphoma) o r fluorodeoxyglucos e - pos itron emission tomography (hematologic malignancies, 
when standard of care [SOC]), as appropriate, will be performed  at baseline. Disease assessment will occur every 
8-9 weeks ±1 week from the start of study therapy. Disease assessment at o ther time points may be performed at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Tumor assessments will continue  until disease progression or until sub jects withdraw 
from the study. Tumor responses will be determined as defined b y RECIST v1.1 criteria for solid tumors. For 
hematologic malignancies, responses will be based on the Lugano 2014 Classification for Initial Evaluation, Staging, 
and Response for Hodgkin Lymphoma. For prostate cancers (CRPC a nd NEPC), responses will be defined based on 
PCWG3. At the Sponsor’s discretion, scans and measurements may be reviewed by independent radiologists using 
RECIST v1.1, Lugano 2014, or PCWG3 criteria at a later date, or at any time during the study.
Pharmacokinetic Measures: Pharmacokinetic parameters for  BMS-986158 (Cmax, Tmax, AUC(TAU), and 
AUC(0-T); single dose only if data permits: T-HALF, AUC(INF), CL T/F, Vz/F; multiple dose only: Cmin, Ctau, 
Ctrough, Accumu lation Index (AI) and T-HALFeff), will be derive d from parent (BMS-986158) and metabolite 
plasma concentration versus time data.  In addition the metabolite to parent ratios adjusted for molecular weight (MR) will be calculated for Cmax, AUC(0-T), AUC(INF) and AUC(TAU).

Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size:  
Dose Escalation : In the dose escalation part of t he study for monotherapy Part 1, the sample size per dose level ca nnot 
be precisely determined and will depend on observed DLTs and the decision rules of the mTPI design. Between 3 and 
up to 13 DLT evaluable subjects may be enrolled to a given dose level, based on the decision guide by the mTPI 
design. Treating additional sub jects beyond the 13 that are DLT evaluable at a dose level would be unlikely to alter 
the decision specified by the mTPI algorithm. A total of approxi mately 30 subjects is expected to be treated per 
schedule, with a total of 90 planned across schedules for the do se escalation phase. More subjects may be added at a 
specific schedule if additional dose levels need to be evaluated. Similarly, fewer than 30 subjects may be needed for 
a different schedule if a smaller number of dose levels are evaluated. 
Cohort Expansion:
During this part of the study, the efficacy signal assessment will start with initial m onotherapy cohorts. This 
assessment will be guided by a Fleming 2-stage design, to provi de the option for early evaluation and planning based 
on an initial efficacy signal. The sample sizes for each cohort  are calculated based on assumptions of true (target) and 
historic ORR for each tumor type. A 2-stage design provides cri teria for the option to stop early for futility, a nd an 
understanding of an early signal of preliminary, strong antitum or activity. Approximately 5 to 9 subjects will be treated 
in each of the cohorts, based on the Fleming (optimal) design c riteria; Enrollment may continue after the initial 
5 subjects to ensure that sufficient subjects are evaluable (eg,  with tumor scans) or in case of early drop outs. There 
will be no stopping due to an efficacy signal. 
In summary, approximately up to 45 subjects are expected to be treated across the Initial monotherapy cohorts, with 
approximately 5 to 9 subjects per cohort. Based on the totality of data obtained from Initial monotherapy cohorts, up 
to 126 subjects may be enrolled in Subsequent monotherapy cohor ts with an expanded set of tumor types within and 
across groups.
If the combination of BMS-986158 with nivolumab is pursued, saf ety will be evaluated across the tumor types in the 
first 6 to 12 evaluable subjects who receive combination therap y based on the DLT observed. The mTPI-2 design with 
DLT target of 29% (-2%, +4%) will be used to guide decisions in  this setting, including potential de-escalation to a 
lower dose of BMS-986158 in combination with nivolumab, if warranted by the observed results. The above sample sizes are base d on the assumption that the selected RP2D is deemed safe in combination therapy. 
If a lower dose level must be evaluated in combination therapy,  an additional 6 to 12 s ubjects may be enrolled to 
assess safety of BMS-986158 prior to fully expanding in combina tion therapy.
The potential total for expansi on will be approximately up to 2 01 subjects if only monotherapy is pursued, and 
approximately up to 327 s ubjects if all planned expansion cohort subjects in monotherapy and combination therapy 
groups are pursued. 
Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoints: Incidence of AEs at their worst grade, serious adverse events ( SAEs) at their worst grade, AEs 
leading to discontinuations, deaths, and frequency of laborator y test toxicity grade shifting from baseline. Safety will 
be evaluated from the time that the subject signs the informed consent and for up to 30 days and 100 days after the 
last dose of BMS-986158 monotherapy or if pursued, BMS-986158 i n combination with nivolumab, respectively, or 
until resolution of any AE for which alternative causes could no t be identified resolve to ≤Grade 1 or baseline or until 
the event has stabilized, whichever is longer.
Pharmacokinetics: Select PK parameters including Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, AUC (TAU), AUC( 0-T), will be derived 
from parent (BMS-986158) and metabolite plasma concentration ve rsus time data for all schedules. In addition 
parameters specific to single dose only, if d ata per mits, (T-HALF, AUC(INF), CLT/F, Vz/F) or multiple dose only 
(Cmin, Ctau, Ctrough, AI and T-HALFeff) will be calculated deri ved from parent (BMS-986158) and metabolite 
plasma concentration versus time data. The metabolite to parent  
 ratios (MR) will also be calculated for Cmax, AUC(0-
T), AUC(INF) and AUC(TAU).

Efficacy: ORR, Duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, and Progression Free Survival Rate (PFSR) 
at select times are efficacy e ndpoints. ORR is defined as the total number of subjects whose b est overall response 
(BOR) is either a CR or PR, divided by the total number of subj ects in the population of interest.
ECG: Changes in QTcF (ΔQTcF) from baseline at selected times followin g monotherapy treatment with 
BMS-986158 and association measures of Q Tc changes with BMS-986158 PK exposure.
Analyses:
Safety Analyses: All recorded AEs will be listed and tabulated by system organ c lass, preferred term and treatment. 
Vital signs and clinical laboratory test results will be listed  and summarized by treatment.  Any significant physical
examination findings and clinical laboratory results will be lis ted. ECG readings by the investigator will be 
summarized, and abnormalities, if present, will be listed. Safety data may also be presented in adolescent participants 
based on data availability.
Efficacy Analyses: Efficacy results will be presented by tumor type, dose level, do sing schedule and/or regimen. 
Individual BOR, DOR and PFS using RECIST v1.1 criteria for solid tumors, Lugano 2014 criteria for hematologic 
malignancies, or PCWG3 for prostate cancers will be listed. BOR ou tcomes and ORR will be tabulated by dose/dose 
regimen and acr oss doses for each tumor. For ORR, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated based on the 
Clopper-Pearson method. The median DOR (mDOR) for responders and m edian PFS will be e stimated by Kaplan-
Meier (K-M) methodology. PFS rates (e.g. at 24 weeks) will be s imilarly estimated, based on K-M methodology, with 
confidence intervals based on the Greenwood formula and tabulat ed for each tumor. Individual changes in the tumor 
burden versus time will be presented graphically by dose level/s tudy arm/dose regimen within a tumor type. 
 
ECG Analyses: For subjects with serial ECG measurements and time-matched PK following monotherapy treatment 
with BMS-986158, changes in the QTcF (ΔQTcF), ECG intervals QRS,  and PR, and in heart rate (ΔHR) will be 
tabulated by treatment and study day. Frequency distributions of  max QTcF values, max ΔQTcF, max QRS, max PR, 
and max heart rate in pre-sp ecified categories will be tabulated by treatment. Scatter plots  of heart rate, ΔHR, QTc, 
and ΔQTcF, vs time-matched BMS -986158 concen trations will be pro vided. A concentration-response effect of 
BMS-986158 on QTcF may be assessed by a linear mixed effects regr ession model for ΔQTcF on PK, by study day, 
as well as pooled across days.
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: PK parameters for BMS- 986158 will be calculated using noncompartmental analysis. 
Summary statistics will be tabulated for the PK parameters by dos e level, dose regimen, and study cycle/day for each 
schedule. To describe the dependency on dose, scatter plots of Cm ax and AUC(0-T), AUC(TAU), versus dose will be 
provided on indicated study cycle for each dose regimen.
 
 Geometric means and coefficien ts of variation (CV%) w ill be reported for Cmax, AUC, Cmin, Ctau, 
Ctrough, CLT/F, Vz/F, AI, T-HALFeff and MR; Medians and ranges will be reported for Tmax; means and Standard 
Deviations will be reported for T-Half. PK data may also be summ arized separately for adolescent participants 
depending on data availability.

Interim Analysis: Because of the exploratory nature of the early phase study, dat a emerging from each dose level, 
treatment arm, or each part of th e study will be e xamined prior to the final lock of the study database for timely 
decisions such as dose level or dose schedule selection, early ter mination of the study or pub lications. Analy ses will 
only consist of listings, summaries, and graphs of the availabl e data. In addition, modeling of PK (e.g. exploration of 
exposure-response and simulations) or key safety data may be ut ilized to inform dose level or dose schedule selection 
for subsequent parts of the study, as data permits. No formal inferences requiring any adjustment to statistical 
significance level will be performed, or adjustment for multipl icity.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic and solid tumo rs have a very poor prognosis1. 
Despite advances in multimodal therapy, increases in overall su rvival (OS) in these patient 
populations have been limited. The unmet need resides in the lack of effective treatm ents to deliver 
long term survival, hence the need to test com pounds that have novel mechanisms of action in 
clinical studies. This study is focused on BM S-986158, a novel e pigenetic drug candidate with 
direct antitumor effects and immunomodulatory functions, which may be further augmented by 
nivolumab.
1.1 Study Rationale
1.1.1 Rationale for targeting bromodomains for cancer therapy
The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of adaptor prot eins is comprised of 4 members 
(BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT), each of which contain two conserv ed N-terminal 
bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) and an extra terminal (ET) protein i nteraction motif.2,3
Bromodomain-med iated interactions with acetylated  chromatin result in the loca lization of BET 
proteins to discrete chromosome regions, where they recruit add itional regulatory complexes to 
influence gene transcription.4,5,6BRD4 is dysregulated by chromosomal translo cation to form in-
frame fusions with th e NUT (nuclear protein in testis) gene in NUT-midline carcinoma (NMC);7
it is also overexpressed in many solid tumors. Early BET inhibi tors, JQ1 and I-BET, demonstrated 
therapeutic effects in multiple tumor models of hematologic malignancies8,9including multiple 
myeloma (MM),10as well as in solid tumors.11The therapeutic activity of BET inhibitors in 
hematologic malignancies correlates with tr anscriptional suppre ssion of key proto-oncogenes, 
including MYC and BCL2.12,13c-MYC is the most frequently amplified oncogene and is 
deregulated in 40% to  70% of all cancers;14however, efforts to target MYC inhibition have not 
been successful to date.15,16
BET inhibitors have the potential to provide an effective strat egy for targeting the MYC oncogene 
in the treatment of cancer.9Examination of BRD4 occupancy at genes whose transcription is 
highly sensitive to JQ1, led to the observation that BRD4 (and potentially other BET family 
members) localizes to the core promoter regions of many oncogen es.17Additionally, BRD4 is 
enriched in enhancer regions, leading to high expression levels  of many growth promoting genes, 
in addition to MYC.17Recent studies demonstrated that key lineage-specific survival g enes are 
regulated by these supe r-enhancer regions.18These enhancers are considerably larger than typical 
gene enhancer regions and are densely populated by transcriptio n factors, leading to strong 
activation of gene transcription. S uper-enhancers are present i n the loci of key oncogenic drivers. 
BRD4 is particularly enriched in these critical control regions  suggesting that inhibition of the 
bromodomain activity of BRD4 will lead to transcriptional repre ssion of these key oncogenic 
drivers.17,18The greater sensitivity of super-enhancers to perturbation by B RD4 inhibition may 
explain why cancer cells are specifically sensitive to BRD4 inh ibition despite ubiquitous BRD4 
expression in a wide range of cells. Because tumor cells are fr equently highly reliant on high

oncogene expression for survival, selective disruption of super -enhancers by a BET inhibitor may 
represent an effective strategy for the treatment of multiple t umor types with an acceptable safety 
profile.
Preclinical studies using in vitro and in vivo models of variou s cancer types demonstrated that 
sensitivity to BET inhibition is higher in tumor cells harborin g genetic abnormalities, including 
gene amplifications (eg, BRD, MY C, or androgen receptor [AR] ge ne),19,20,21,22mutations (eg, 
Gnaq/11, KRAS, or SWI/SNF),23,24and translocations (eg, MYC, BCL2/6, or BRD3/4).25,26,27
These findings warrant further clinical investigations to under stand whether the selected genetic 
abnormalities can be used as biomarkers for sensitivity of the tumors to treatment with BET 
inhibitors.
1.1.2 Rationale for combining BMS-986158 with Nivolumab
BET proteins are important in the control of networks of genes,  and depending on the context, 
function as co-activators or co-repressors regulating expressio n of approximately 3,000 genes. 
BET inhibitors disrupt the binding interface between the bromod omain and the acteylated lysine 
groups resulting in pleotropic effects. Several BET inhibitors are currently under investigation as 
anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodu latory agents changing a whole field of new 
epigenetically targeted therapeutics.28
Cooperative interactions between BET inhibitors and PD-1 inhibi tors may involve different 
molecular pathways. In flammatory cytokines, i ncluding IFNγ, are expressed within the tumor
microenvironment and upregulate PD-L1 levels contributing to im munosuppression.29,30
Induction of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, as a downstream e ffect of canonical IFNγ signaling, 
is BRD4-dependent.25In some tumors, BET inhibitors  reduce IFNγ-mediated PD-L1 induc tion 
via inhibition of NF-κB activity.31,32In mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) cells, BET inhibition does not induce PD-L1 down regulation,25suggesting that 
the effect of BET inhibitors on PD-L1 expression is not univers al and is likely cell-context 
dependent. JQ1, a BET inhibitor, has been reported to interfere  with the production of both pro-
inflammatory (IL-12 and TNF) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and T GF-β) cytokines from de ndritic 
cells, with lower mRNA expressi on of IL-12 a nd TNF but higher exp ression of IL- 10 and TGF- β. 
At the same time, JQ1 reduced monocyte-derived dendritic cell maturation and T cell 
proliferation.33This finding supports that JQ1 and possibly other BET inhibitor s such as BMS-
986158 may have immunosuppressive activity in som e contexts.34However, studies in animal 
models demonstrated that targeted inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis by combining anti-PD-1 
antibodies and the BET inhibitor JQ1 resulted in synergistic re sponses in mice bearing MYC-
driven lymphomas.25These contradictory findings highlight the need to define the e ffect of BMS-
986158 on the immune system before exploring the combination of  BMS-986158 with anti-PD-1 
agents such as nivolumab. Clinical development of this combinatio n regimen may provide 
additional options for patients who are currently not effective ly treated with anti-PD-1 
monotherapy.

1.1.3 Rationale for targeting PD-1
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the  premise that tumors can be re cognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveilla nce of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately result in immune responses and can cer cell death. Meanwhile, tumor 
progression may depend upon acquisi tion of traits that allow ca ncer cells to evade 
immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive imm une responses.35,36,37Current 
immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of  the immune system  to tumor 
cells and antigens by either introducing cancer antigens by the rapeutic vaccination or by 
modulating regulatory checkpoints  of the immune s ystem. T-cell stimulation is a complex process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negat ive co-stimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by the T- cell r eceptor.38Collectively, these signals govern the 
balance between T-cell act ivation and tolerance.
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a member of the CD28 f amily of T-cell co-stimulatory 
receptors.39PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD28-mediated upregula tion of IL-2, IL-
10, IL-13, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) , and Bcl-xL. PD-1 expression has  also been noted to inhibit T-cell 
activation and expansion of  previously activ ated cells. Evidence for a negative regulatory  role of 
PD-1 comes from studies of PD-1 deficient mice, which develop a  variety of autoimmune 
phenotypes.40These results suggest that PD-1 blockade has the potential to a ctivate anti-self T-
cell responses, but these responses are variable and dependent upon various host genetic factors. 
Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a uni versal loss of tolerance to 
self-antigens.
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS- 936558) binds specifically to PD-1 with high affinity and inhib its the 
binding of PD-1 to its ligands , programmed cell death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1) and programmed  cell 
death-ligand 2 (PD-L2). In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine an alog of nivolumab enhances the 
antitumor immune response and result in tumor rejection in seve ral immunocompetent mouse 
tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02).41
Clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate safety and eff icacy of nivolumab across various 
tumor types. Nivolumab has been approved as treatment for melan oma, non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC, both nonsquamous and squamous histologies), head and ne ck cancer, renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and mismat ch repair deficient and 
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer in the  US and other countries, and is 
being evaluated extensively across a wide range of other solid tumors and hematological 
malignancies.42,43

1.1.4 Preclinical studies with BMS-986158
BMS-986158 has been tested against a wide-array of cancer cell lines and has demonstrated potent 
cytotoxicity against multiple hematologic and solid tumors. Man y of the most sensitive cancer 
types are driven by c-MYC including MM, AML and small cell lung  carcinoma (SCLC). The on-
target mechanism of BMS-986158 is evidenced by its inhibition o f c-MYC expression in the 
JJN3R MM cell line at the same potency (IC50 = 0.8 nM) as its targ eted cytotoxicity potency 
(IC50 = 4 nM). Two other hematologic cell lines, known to be driven by c-MYC, MOLM-13 and 
OCI-AML3, demonstrated sensitivity with IC50 of 1.7 and 0.7 nM,  respectively.
In a panel of 30 human lung cancer cell lines, BMS- 986158 demonstrated potent and selective 
cytotoxic activity (IC50 <10 nM) in 8 lines, intermediate activity (IC50 = 10- 100 nM) in 4, and 
low activity in 18 (IC50 >100 nM). Six of the 8 highly sensitiv e cell lines were SCLC, further 
re-enforcing the potential importance of c-MYC in the mechanism  of action (MOA) of 
BMS-986158 BET inhibition.
BMS-986158 was evaluated in a panel of patient-derived xenograf ts (PDX) i n mice. The  dose of 
BMS-986158 (1.6 mg/kg administered BID, 5-days-on- 2-days-off fo r two cycles) was 2-3-fold 
below its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in mice (MTD range: 5-10 mg/kg QD x10; 
3.2-4.8 mg/kg BIDx10). BMS-986158 demonstrated antitumor activit y (tumor growth inhibition 
[TGI] > 70%) in 8 of 19 (42%) of the PDX models tested. The exce llent potency of BMS-986158 
against hematologic can cer cell lines in vitro was also reflected  in vivo in tumor xenografts in 
mice; each demonstrated robust sensitivity to BMS-986158 at low , well-tolerated doses. In an 
ovarian cancer (OC) PDX model that was determined to have amplifi cation of the BRD4 gene, 
tumor regression was observed during the dosing period (TGI = 1 26%) suggesting that tumors 
with BRD4 amplification may be particularly sensitive to BET in hibition. Analysis of human 
TCGA data also shows that approximately 27% of ovarian tumors o f serous histology that are 
BRCA 1/2 wildtype are also have BRD4 amplification.
1.1.5 Rationale for Dose and Schedule
BMS-986158
In the pivotal 1-month oral toxicity studies of BMS-986158, the highest non-severely toxic dose 
(HNSTD) in dogs was 0.15 mg/kg. The MTD in rats was 0.25 mg/kg.  The dog was considered the 
most appropriate species for calculation of the maximum recomme nded starting dose (MRSD)
because a nontolerated dose was attained in dog but not rat and  the toxicity profile was similar in 
both species. The starting dose of 0.75 mg/day was selected base d upon the human equivalent dose 
(HED; scaled by body-s urface area) of the HNSTD in dogs (the more sensitive species b etween 
dogs and rats) with a safety factor of 1/6 (see Section 1.4.2 for details). The projected human 
efficacious dose is estimated to be 2 mg/day based on the obser ved human pharmacokinetics (PK) 
and a projected human efficacious concentration of 46 ng/mL. Th is concentration is derived from 
the minimal efficacious concentration (MEC) established in a mo use xenograft model and 
corrected for protein binding differences between species. As a patient’s disease pathophysiology 
differs from preclinical animal tumor models, the human efficac ious dose will be determined and 
confirmed in clinical studies.

To assure safety of human subjects, the init ial dose of BMS- 986158 tested in this study was 
0.75 mg/day. Part 1 of this study also evaluates different administr ation schedules: monotherapy 
given 5 consecutive days on with 2 days off each week of a 4-week  cycle (Schedule A of Part 1); 
monotherapy given 14 consecutive days on with 7 days off of a 3 -week cycle (Sch edule B of Part 
1); and monotherapy given 7 days on and 14 days off of a 3-week cy cle (Schedule C of Part 1). 
The rationale for the 3 schedules is based on the human half-lif e of 39 hours. Schedule A 
effectively  provides c ontinuous drug exposure, wh ile Schedules B and C provide intermittent 
exposure with a break to allow for platelet recovery as needed at higher doses in human trials of 
other compounds in this class.44,45,46,47
For Part 2, Schedule A, has been selected considering the safety,  
and PK obtained during Part 1 (see Section 3.1.2.1 ). Preliminary analysis of Part 1 showed that 
Schedule A provide d continuous drug exposure with a tolerated sa fety profile at selected doses 
above the projected eff icacious dose and resulted in su stained targeted gene expressio n 
modulation. BMS-986158 will be administered at a starting dose of 4.5 mg for 2 weeks (10 doses) 
followed by 3.75 mg for the remainder of treatment. A higher do se of 4.5 mg will ensure initial 
maximal suppression of key oncogenes . The 
subsequent reduction in dose is expected to maintain this gene suppression without compromising 
tolerabilit y and to mitigate the poten tial risk for dose interruptions and dose delays. Further dose 
reduction is permitted  beyond the dose de-escalation to 3.75 mg  depending on toxicity and 
tolerability observed in each subject (see guidelines for dose modification in Section 4.5.2 ).
In addition to adult subjects, a dolescent subjects w ill be includ ed in Part 2 and dosage rationale 
for these subjects is discussed in Section 1.1.13 .
Depending on safety, PK and the totality of d ata obtain ed from Part 2, Schedule A with BMS-
986158 monotherapy, subjects may also be enrolled in Schedules B or C upon agreement between 
investigators and the Sponsor/Medical Monitor.
Nivolumab
Nivolumab has been extensively studied in a number of tumor typ es with body weight normalized 
dosing (mg/kg), and a dose of 3 mg/kg has been approved to be use d as monotherapy.42,43
Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analyses showed that the PK of nivolumab is linear with 
dose-proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/k g, similar across tumor types. To 
evaluate the impact of a flat dosing regimen on the safety and efficacy of nivolumab, simulations 
were performed using the previously developed, well-characteriz ed PPK model. Based on the 
simulation results, the range of systemic exposures of nivoluma b resulting from either a 3-mg/kg 
dose or 360 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)  flat doses is similar. The 
dosage regimen for nivolumab for the currently approved indicat ions in the US (RCC, metastatic
melanoma and NSCLC) has been modified to 240 mg IV every 2 weeks (Q2W) based on FDA 
approval of the dosi ng regimen on 13 -Sep-2016.
Nivolumab has been shown to be safe and well toler ated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg, and the 
relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy has been found to be

Approved 10.0 v Approved 1.0 v

BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
relatively flat.42,43Taken together, the PK, safety,  and efficacy data indicate that  the safety and 
efficacy profile of 360 mg Q3W or 480 mg Q4W nivolumab will be similar to that of 3 mg/kg 
Q2W nivolumab. Based on these results, a flat dose of 360 mg Q3 W or 480 mg Q4W is 
recommended for further investigation in adult subjects. A total  body-weight dose of 4.5 mg/kg 
Q3W up to a maximum of 360 mg or 6 mg/kg Q4W up to a maximum of 4 80 mg is recommended 
for adolescent subjects. 
The decision to pursue combination therapy with nivolumab will be made depending on  
 
safety 
and PK results obtained during Part 2 monotherapy. If combinati on with nivolumab is pursued, 
Schedule A (5 days on/2 days off for a 4-week cycle) will be use d to dose BMS-986158 with a flat 
dose of 480 mg Q4W nivolumab. The dosage in adolescent subjects is discussed in Section 1.1.13
1.1.6 Rationale for Monotherapy Dose Escalation Design and Combination 
Safety Monitoring. 
The increment in the dose levels used in monotherapy dose escal ation, especially in the first 
schedule tested (Schedule A), is guided by the modified Fibonacci t o help mitigate the potential 
risk inherent in the steep dos e/toxicity curve a nd/or the low t herapeutic index seen in preclinical 
studies. Dose escalation decisions will utilize a modified toxi city probability interval (mTPI) 
design.48Rationale for selection of an mTPI over a 3+3 design includes a more accurate 
determination of MTD, greater f lexibility in c ohort size, and t hat it allows de-escalation and re-
escalation to a previously tried dose. The design provides a sim ple dose escalation decision 
algorithm ( Appendix 1 ), and in addition to the higher accuracy of MTD selection, it trea ts fewer 
subjects at suboptimal doses, as seen by simulations described in Appendix 2 .
If pursued, the safety monitoring of the selected  BMS-986158 do se in combination with nivolumab 
based on dose limiti ng toxicities (DLTs) will be guided within the mTP I framew ork using the more 
recently available mTPI-2 met hodology and taking into account prior informatio n on the safety of 
monotherapy for nivolumab and BMS-986158 related AEs observed so far. The mTPI-2 design 
provides better operating characteristics over the 3+3 method ( Appendix 8 ) and has improved 
performance over the original mTPI design, as it was developed t o mitigate some suboptimal 
decisions by the original mTPI design and t o provide a more efficient safety evaluation than the 
mTPI.49
1.1.7 Rationale for Evaluating BMS-986158 in an Initial Monotherapy 
Expansion Cohort
The number of subjects and types of tumors initially enrolled in the Part 2 expansion will be limited to initially focus on tumor types where the greatest signal of activity is expected, based on 
published preclinical and clinical data.
143,50Preliminary antitumor activity will be assessed in 
subjects enrolled during the Initi al Expansion, to inform subse quent expansion.

1.1.8 Rationale for Genetically Defined Tumor Groups
Drug development strategies in oncology continue to evolve with  the advent of hi stology-agnostic 
biomarkers correlating with the clinical activity of targeted a nticancer drugs. For example, recent 
breakthrough findings led to accelerated approval of pembrolizu mab for the treatment of adult and 
pediatric patients with various solid tumors bearing MSI-H or m ismatch repair deficiency.51,52
Another success of such an approach is a development of larotre ctinib, a selective TRK tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor that demonstr ated histology-agnostic efficacy in patients with TRK fusion-
positive cancers.53Thus, in the light of these novel strategies, tumors with genet ic rearrangements 
that engage molecular pathways r egulated by BRD proteins, inclu ding gene translocations, 
mutations, or amplifications, have been selected for Part 2 of this study to identify early clinical 
activity in these  preselected patient populations. The results of this study may help to understand 
whether the activity of BMS-986158 depends on specific genetic alterations observed in selected 
histologies or may be tumor agnostic.
Translocations
Chromosomal translocations may lead to the formation of fusion pro teins with oncogenic 
properties. Examples of these genetic abnormalities include BRD 3,4-NUT fusion (in 75% of cases 
of NMC), EWS/FLI1 fusion (in 85% of cases of Ewing sarcoma [ES] ), and IGH/L-MYC and IGH-
BCL-2/6 fusions (in Burkitt’s lymphoma [BL] and double-hit lymph oma [DHL]).
•NMC: BRD3 or BRD4, as partners in the BRD3,4-NUT fusion protein , directly contribute to 
malignant transformatio n by interferi ng with cell differentiation,54,55and BET inhibitors have 
been shown to suppress tumor growth in preclinical models as well as in patients.26,46,56,57
•ES: BRD proteins function as epigenetic readers regulating the e xpression of 
EWS/FLI1.58,59,60,61,62BET inhibitors downregulate EWS/FLI1 expression and interfere w ith 
tumor cell viability, proliferation, and growth in animal models.27,63
•Lymphomas: Pathogenesis of Burki tt’s lymphoma (BL) is driven by translocation of 
MYC,64,65and DHL by translocation of both MYC and BLC2 or BCL6.66The expression of 
formed IGH/L-MYC and IGH-BCL-2 fusion proteins is regulated by the BET family,9,67,68
and BET inhibitors arrested tumor cell growth in vitro as well as in xenograft models.9,25,69
Detection of these fusion proteins is required for diagnosis an d is a routine clinical practice. 
Initially, only subjects with NMC carrying BRD3,4-NUT fusion wi ll be selected to participate in 
Part 2. Subjects with other fusion proteins may be eligible to participate in Part 2 of this study as 
part of the Subsequent Expansion based on review of the totalit y of data obtained from subjects in 
the Initial Expansion in Part 2 (see Section 3.1.2).

Mutations
SWI/SNF functions as a tumor suppressing complex and mutations in subunits contribute to 
malignant transformation.70The KRAS protein is required for signaling in normal cells, and  the 
mutation of a KRAS gene contributes to the development of many cancers. Similarly, Gnaq and 
Gnaq/11 mediate the intracellular signal transduction pathway, and mutations in these genes lead 
to oncogenesis.
•Renal cell carcinoma (RCC): A pproximately 40% of patients with RCC harbor mutations 
within the SWI/SNF complex, including ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4, SMARCA2, 
SMARCB1, ARID2, PBRM1 (BAF180) ,71and BET inhibitors i nduced RCC cell apoptosis 
and repressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.23
•Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):  BMS-986158 suppr essed prolif eration of NSCLC cell 
lines with SWI/SNF mutations (BMS, data on file). In vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of 
other BET inhibitors has also been reported in NSCLC cells harb oring KRAS mutations, 
although this effect was abrogated by concurrent alterations of  LKB1, also known as STK11.72
According to TCGA database, 30% of patients with NSCLC harbor SWI/SNF mutations, and 
15% harbor KRAS mutations of which approximately 75% express wild type LKB1. 
•Uveal melanoma (UM): BET inhibitor demonstrated cytotoxic activi ty in UM cells carrying 
Gnaq/11 mutations and inhibited tumor growth in xenograft model s.24
Mutations in SWI /SNF complex, KRAS, and Gnaq/11 will be detecte d in tumor biopsies using the 
 diagnostic platform. Mutations in SWI/SNF complex, KRAS, and 
Gnaq/11 will be detected in tumor biopsies using the  diagnostic  
platform. Subjects with tumors carrying these mutations may be eligible to participate in Part 2 of 
this study as part of the Subsequent Expansion based on review of the totality of d ata obtained 
from subjects in the Initial Expansion in Part 2 (see Section 3.1.2 andFigure 3.1-1 ). 
Amplifications
•BRD: In patients with OC, BRD amplification is associated with worse overall survival.19
BRD gene amplification correlates with overexpression of  BRD RNA (TCGA database) and 
is necessary for proliferation and survival of some tumor cell types, includi ng OC20and triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC).21Blocking hyperactivity of BRD proteins with a BET 
inhibitor results in growth inhibition of xenografts obtained f rom patients with OC19and from 
patients with TNBC.21,73,74Approximately 43% of patients with TNBC, 55% of patients with 
neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and 17% of patients with  OC harbor BRD4 
amplifications (TCGA database). 
•MYC: Forty-one percent of patients with castration-resistant pro state cancer (CRPC) and 47% 
of OC patients harbor MYC amplifications (TCGA database). BET in hibition results in 
reduced MYC expression and inhibition of tumor growth in PDX mo dels with high MYC 
expression and inhibition of AR signaling.75High frequency of MYC amplification
(approximately 30%) has also been observed in patients with ute rine carcinosarcoma (UCS; 
TCGA database). Also, the non-germinal center subtype of diffuse  large B-cell lymphoma 
(non-GC-DLBCL) is often associat ed with MYC (and BCL2) overexpre ssion.76A recent

Phase I study of a BET inhibitor in patients with relapsed and refractory lymphoma reported 
objective clinical responses in the non-GC-DLBCL subtype, in par ticular in patients with 
activated B cell (ABC)-DLBCL.77
•AR: Among other genetic a bnormalities sensitive to BET regulation is AR amplification.22AR 
promotes ligand- independent prostate cancer (PC) progression through c-MYC upregulation.78
BET inhibitors decreased MYC levels and proliferation viability o f CRPC cells, and inhibited 
growth of PC xenografts.22Approximately 67% of CRPC patients harbor AR amplification, 
and 25% to 30% harbor both MYC and AR amplifications (TCGA datab ase). 
BRD, MYC, and AR amplifications will be detected in tumor biops ies using

amplifications/overexpressions will be eligible to participate i n  P a r t  2  a s  p a r t  o f  t h e  I n i t i a l

1.1.9 Rationale for Tumor Specific Patient Populations
NMC : NMC is a rare and aggressive tumor that has a lethal clinical  course and no established 
treatment al gorithms.79In the absence o f guid elines, combinations of different drugs (actinomycin 
D, alkylating agent, anthracycline, vinca-alkaloid, VP-16, plat inum compounds, taxane agents, 
5-FU, and cytarabine) have been used as first line (1L) therapy  for NMC. On current therapies, 
patients die of disease with median overall survival (OS) time of 9 .7 months from the time of 
diagnosis.80While several complete response (CR) cases following 1L therapy  have been reported, 
the majority of patients relapse with a median time to progressi on of 9.3 months.81Only 
8 survivors have been reported to date, and all received surgery  in combination with chemotherapy 
or radiation.80Since the vast majority of NMC cases remain refractory to conve ntional therapy 
with no 2L options, efforts have been made to develop novel tar geted therapeut ics. In 75% of 
cases, NUT (NUTM1) is fused to BRD3 or BRD4 forming a fusion pr otein that drives oncogenic 
transformation.82Thus, BET inhibitors may directly interfere with molecular mechan isms 
mediating NMC pathogenesis. In a recent study, 3 of 10 s ubjects treated with OTX015/MK-8628
achieved (partial response) PR or stable disease (SD),83although the genetic rearrangements in 
responders versus non-responders have not been reported. Becaus e survival with current therapies 
has been dependent on the possibility of surgical resection, sub jects with unresectable NMC
harboring BRD3-NUT and BRD4-NUT fusio ns, regardless of prior treatments, will be eligible to 
participate in this study. 
ES: There is a consensus for the ES treatment pathway that VDC/IE  interval compression
chemotherapy is recommended for 1L therapy.84,85Local control includes s urgery and radiation. 
Most ES relapses (approximately 80%) occur within 2 years of the initial dia gnosis.86,87
Chemotherapy is generally recommended for all rec urrent ES patients; however, the outcomes 
remain poor. A combination of iri notecan and temozolomide is th e first option after relapse,

primarily because of the favorable toxicity profile. The combin ed response (CR+PR) rate on this 
regimen is 53%, and progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months i s approximately 60%. Another 
regimen is cyclophosphamide and topotecan, and responses to thi s therapy were correlated with 
the relapse interval, with no responses when the disease was progressing on prior therapy and with 
a response rate of approximately 50% when 2 years had passed be tween the prior therapy and the 
initiation of therapy. The intensification of conventional ther apy or even myeloablative 
chemotherapy with hematopioetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has no t been reported to be 
advantageous. In the relapse setting, the response or disease s tabilization after all these therapies 
with median postrecurrence survival ranges from 9 to 17 months d ependent on the extent of 
disease. Thus, the development of novel therapeutic approaches is  warranted. ES is associated with 
translocation of EWS and FLI1 genes resulting in a ch imeric fusion transcript EWS/FLI1 in 85% 
of cases.58EWS/FLI1 fusion protein acts as a transcription factor and drive s ES cell proliferation 
and survival by inducing a panel of genes, including GLI159,60and MYC,61,62and BET inhibitors 
have been shown to downregulate EWS/FLi1 expression.63Thus, ES patients harboring the 
EWS/FLI1 fusion that progressed after 1L therapy will be eligible to  participate in this study.
BL: While BL is among the therapeutic successes in oncology, the optimal init ial therapy f or BL 
has not been clearly defined giv en the paucity of randomized st udies and the fact that different, 
modern BL regimen s can all achieve good results.88Several chemotherapy regimens have been 
successfully tested, including CODOX-M/IVAC,89LMB 89,90R-Hyper-CVAD,91and 
others88,92,93,94with CR rates up to 95% and 5-year OS in 70% of patients. Incid ence of relapse or 
refractory disease is approximately 10%, and current results in  refractory/relapsed BL are 
extremely poor.88For relapsed or refractory BL in patients who have not received  prior cytarabine, 
regimens such as dexamethasone plus cytarabine plus cisplatin o r etoposide plus 
methylprednisolone plus cytarabine plus cisplatin may be consid ered. Gemcitabine-based 
regimens, such as gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin, ar e an option for patients who have 
received cytarabine. Unfortunately, the vast majority of patien ts will not respond to additional 
chemotherapy. Responders are referred for high-dose chemotherap y and HSCT, with a reported 
5-year OS of only 21% and 18% for autologous and allogeneic HSCT, respectively.95The salvage 
treatment of relapsed or refractory BL is usually unsuccessful. M edian survival f or patients with 
progressive disease (PD) or early relapse is 5 months,96and no long-term disease-free survivors
after BL relapse have been reported.88,97Therefore, novel therapies are needed for this patient 
population. BL is driven by MYC tr anslocation and formation of an IGH-MYC fusion with the 
IGH,98,99and importantly, transl ocated MYC locus ha rbors super enhancers  that are sensitive to 
BET inhibition.100In preclinical studies, treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 re sulted in a 45% 
tumor volume reduction in Raji cell xenografts as compared to c ontrol.9In combination with a 
PD-L1 inhibitor, JQ1 treatment resulted in 100% CR in mice with E μ-MYC lymphoma,25
supporting further studies. Therefore, patients with BL that re lapsed or are refractory to 1L therapy 
will be eligible to participate in this study.

DHL and non-GC-DLBCL: DHL and non-GC-DLBCL are highly aggressive disease subsets of 
DLBCL with very poor clinical outcomes and the standard of care (SOC) has not been established
for DHL.101,102Patients are treated with various chemotherapy regimens, includi ng R-CHOP, 
R-EPOCH, HyperCVAD, and CODOX-MI VAC as 1L therapy. Retrospectiv e analysis across 
different studies demonstrated an approximately 57% CR rate for D HL.103,104DHL and non-GC-
DLBCL are associated with advanced age, therefore, regimens such  as CODOX-M/IVAC and 
HyperCVAD/MA, which are poorly tolerated in elderly patients, a re not appropriate for the 
majority of these patients, whereas R-EPOCH has been suggested a s appropriate for most patients 
with DHL.105Overall, the outcome of patients with DHL or non-GC-DLBCL treat ed with 
conventional chemotherapy is often poor because, despite the response r ate, the majority of 
patients will experience disease progression after standard treatment with PFS of approximately 
9 months and median OS of 15 months.104,106,107Regimens used in relapsed/refractory DHL 
include R-DHAP, R-ESHAP, R-GDP, and R-ICE. However, none of thes e traditional 
chemoimmunotherapy regimens produced a significant rate of complete or sus tained remissions
with a 3-year OS rate from the time of fir st progression of 7% and median OS of 
8m o n t h s .94,104,108, 109Overall, the optimal approach to DHL and non-GC-DLBCL is unknow n, 
and developing optimal therapeutics for DHL and non-GC-DLBCL represents a great unmet 
clinical need.110,111DHL is characterized by translocation of both MYC and BCL2 (IGH -MYC
and IGH-BCL2), and both fusion proteins expressed on BRD4-loaded superenhancers may be directly targeted by BET inhibitors
.100,112Non-GC-DLBCL is characterized by MYC (and BCL2) 
overexpression, which may be also be targeted by BET inhibitors. Indeed, in combination with 
other agents (eg, bortezomib, YM-155, or chemotherapy), JQ1 kill s DHL cells in vitro.69Another 
BET inhibitor, GS-5829, in combination with venetoclax resulted in broader activity in a DLBCL 
cell line with greater activity c orrelating with higher MYC protein levels compared with either 
agent alone.113Thus, subjects with DHL or non-G C-DLBCL that relapsed or are ref ractory to 1L
therapy will be eligible for enrollment in the Initial Expansio n in Part 2 of this study.
OC: Platinum-containing compounds are recommended as 1L therapy for  patients with OC and 
may be repeated as long as the disease remains platinum sensiti ve. Platinum refr actory disease 
(RD) is defined as disease progression during the last line of platinum therapy or within 4 weeks 
from the last platinum dose, and platinum-resistant disease is defined by a platinum free interval 
(time from last platinum-based chemotherapy to recurrence) of > 1  and < 6 months.114A majority 
(80%) of patients with advanced disease experience a recurrence within 5 years from diagnosis, 
with 70% of them relapsing within 18 months.115Among patients affected by recurrent disease, 
approximately 23% are platinum resistant, with 5.3% presenting as RD.116When single agents 
like topotecan, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin are us ed, the PFS 
across different studies is approximately 5 months with OS appro ximately 15 months.117Recently 
revised National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend the following

combination regimens for patients with platinum-resistant recur rent OC: paclitaxel plus 
bevacizumab, liposomal doxorubicin plus bevacizumab, and topote can plus bevacizumab.118A 
combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy agents resulted in  improved PFS of 6.7 months 
with median OS of 16.6 months.119The poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, rucaparib,
has been recently approved as a single agent for patients with advanced OC harboring BRCA 
mutations with PFS of 12.8 months.120,121Another PARP inhibitor (olaparib) has also been 
approved for patients with BRCA-mutated progressive OC, and olap arib and niraparib have been 
approved in the maintenance setting (ongoing complete or partia l response to platinum-based 
chemotherapy). Palliative chemotherapy has been shown only to r educe symptoms in patients with 
platinum-resistant disease without improving the outcomes.115,122Since agents available for 
patients with platinum-resistant and refractory OC provide only temporary benefit,119novel
therapeutic approaches are needed.123Increased BRD levels are associated with worse PFS and 
OS in patients with OC,19and BRD4 is necessary for proliferation and survival of OC cell s20
providing a basis for testing BET inhibitors in patients harbor ing BET amplifications. 
Furthermore, BET inhibitor JQ1 inhibited OC tumor growth with h igh MYC expression in PDX 
models.20Therefore, subjects with platinum-resistant OC harboring BET and /or MYC 
amplifications will be eligible to  participate in this study; s ubjects with platinum-resistant OC with 
BET and/or MYC amplifications and coexisting BRCA1 or BRCA2 mut ations will be eligible 
after treatment with a PARP inhibitor, if available. 
TNBC : For local disease, surgery a nd radiotherapy a re preferred as 1L therapy. Although, based 
on NCCN and the European Society for Medical Oncology guideline s, there is no SOC therapy 
identified as the treatment of choice specifically for TNBC, al kylator plus anthracycline plus 
taxane-based chemotherapy backbone are frequently used for earl y stage systemic 
treatment.124,125,126Approximately 30% of patients achieve CR with 5-year disease-free s urvival 
of 57% and 5-year OS of 70%.127Approximately 36% of patients experience recurrence after the 
front line neoadjuvant therapy with 25% developing distant metas tasis. Survival duration of 
patients with metastatic TNBC is approximately 15 months.128Patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 
mutations (30% of TNBC patients) have above average platinum sen sitivity.129In patients with 
metastatic 1L or 2L TNBC treated with carboplatin or docetaxel, objective respons e rates (ORRs)
were observed in 31.4% in the carboplatin arm and 35.6% in the docetaxel arm. The median PFS 
was 3.1 months in the carboplatin arm and 4.5 months in the docet axel arm with a median OS of 
12.4 months and 12.3 months, respectively. Carboplatin demonstrat ed significantly increased 
activity vs  docetaxel in BRCA-carriers. ORR was 68% w ith carboplatin and 33% with doceta xel. 
In BRCA-negative patients, ORRs w ere not significantly different  at 28.1% with carboplatin and 
36.6% with docetaxel. Despite the high ORR to carboplatin, respo nses were short in both 
subgroups: BRCA-positive patients had a median PFS of 6.8 month s compared with 3.1 months 
in patients with nonmutated BRCA-receiving ca rboplatin. For p atients with m etastatic cancer, 
sequential single agents are preferred, including taxanes, topo isomerase II inhibitors, platinum-

based drugs, vinca alkaloids, and other antitubulins and antime tabolites, although toxicity profiles 
should be considered.126,130Despite these therapeutic approaches, TNBC remains a lethal dise ase, 
thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Approximately 34%  of TNBC patients harbor BRD 
amplifications resulting in increased levels of BRD proteins, w hich control growth and 
proliferation of cancer cells.21BET inhibitors JQ1 and OTX015/MK-8628 inhibit TNBC 
proliferation in vitro and in vivo73,74providing a scientific rationale for testing the effects of BET  
inhibitors in patients with TNBC harboring BRD amplifications. Thus, subjects with TNBC 
positive for BRD amplification that progressed after at least 1 therapy in the recurrent/metastatic 
setting will be eligible to participate in either Part 1 or 2 o f this study. 
CRPC: Most PC-related deaths are results of mCRPC, which progresses an d metastasizes after 
surgical or med ical castration.131NCCN guidelines recommend use of Sipuleucel-T as 1L therapy 
in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC. D ocetaxel represents the 
current 1L therapy for symptomat ic CRPC patients, and Radium-22 3 can be used as 1L therapy in 
patients who are not candidates for docetaxel.132Time-to-tr eatment f ailure in patients treated with 
docetaxel is approximately 5 months.133Abiraterone or enzalutamide can be used as 2L therapy
in patients who progressed on docetaxel, and mitoxantrone and p rednisone can used for 
palliation.132Patients with metastatic disease progressing after docetaxel tr eated with abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone achieved median 5.6 months PFS compared t o 3.6 months in patients 
treated with prednisone alone.134In patients with mCRPC who progressed on docetaxel, treatment 
with enzalutamide resulted in median PFS of 8.3 months compared  with 2.9 months on placebo.135
Different guidelines are provided by the European Association o f Urology: based on the 
performance status, symptoms, com orbidities, and extent of dise ase, the choice of 1L tr eatment 
includes abiraterone, cabazitaxel, docetaxel, enzalutamide, Rad ium 223, and sipuleucel-T. When 
used as 1L therapy in mCRPC patients, abiraterone plus predniso ne treatment re sulted in PFS of 
16.5 months compared with 8.2 months for prednisone alone.136The options for 2L therapy are 
affected by the treatment chosen as 1L therapy: if either abiraterone or enzalutamide were used as 
1L therapy, docetaxel would be offered next; if docetaxel was used as 1L therapy, cabazitaxel, abiraterone plus prednisone, or enzalutamide can be used in pat ients who had progressed after or 
during docetaxel-based chemotherapy.
137It is also recommended that patients who develop 
CRPC, despite castrate levels of testosterone, should be maintain ed in a castrate state 
indefinitely.138However, regardless of treatment , life expectancy for CRPC pati ents is only 15 to 
20 months.137,139,140,141,142Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs targeting 
alternative pathways.138Recent studies have shown that BET inhibitors inhibited growth of CRPC 
in vitro and in vivo, and AR overexpressing cells are more sensi tive to BRD inhibitors.22
OTX015/MK-8628, in a Phase I monotherapy, dose-escalation study, demonstrated clinical 
activity in an unselected population of advanced solid cancer. One patient with CRPC was r eported 
to have an unconfirmed PR; no details of genetic amplification we re given.143Therefore, subjects

taxane and with an androgen pathway antagonist (eg, abiraterone  or enzalutamide) will be eligible 
to participate in either Part 1 or 2 of this study, and will be permitted to continue abirate rone but 
not enzalutamide to maintain a castrate state.
NEPC: Radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiation therapy (RT) combined w ith chemotherapy are 
commonly used as 1L therapy for localized NEPC.144,145Metastatic disease is identified in 64% 
of cases at diagnosis with me dian survival of 8.5 months.145,131Neither RP nor RT improve 
survival in metastatic patients.145. Currently available data suggest that chemo-radiotherapy 
provides max imal benefit in metastatic patients with ORR of 6 1%, however, prognosis i s poor 
regardless of histologic subtype and administered treatment due  to quick progression (PFS of 
5.8 months) and OS of 10.5 months 131,146. Current 1L treatment generall y entails platinum-based 
chemotherapy.147,148Pure small cell carcinoma is frequently treated with platinum p lus etoposide 
combinations, and mixed NEPC is frequently treated with docetax el.147However, the duration of 
response is transient with a median survival of less than 12 mo nths.147In a recent study, patients 
were treated with cisplatin plus etoposide after disease progre ssion on a carboplatin plus docetaxel 
regimen, with median OS of 16 months. The trial results suggest that continued platinum-based 
chemotherapy with the addition of etoposide may be a 2L therapy o ption in patients with NEPC 
who experience disease progression on platinum plus taxane comb inations.149However, others 
recommend this regimen for palliative purposes due to high toxi city rates.150,151,152Other 
regimens, such as a combination of estrogen and somatostatin an alogues, provided symptomatic 
responses in patients who were refractory to conventional therapy.153Palliative benefit of clinical 
symptom control was also shown for the combination of cyclophos phamide and mitoxantrone with 
34.5% ORR and 7.5 months PFS.154,155Given the poor outcomes with current options,144,150,156
studies are needed to identify novel targeted therapies.147Approximately 23% of patients with 
NEPC harbor BRD4 amplifications,71and the inhibitory effect of BET inhibitor JQ1 on growth of 
neuroendocrine tumors in preclinical models has been reported.157Thus, subjects with metastatic 
NEPC harboring BRD amplifications that relapsed or is refractory to 1L therapy will be eligible 
to participate in this study. UCS : Per NCCN guidelines, carcinosarcoma is now considered and trea ted as high-grade 
carcinoma. For UCS, NCCN guidelin es include com plete s urgical s taging followed by systemic 
chemotherapy including ifosfamide/paclitaxel or cisplatin/ifosf amide combinations as 1L
therapy.
158Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup also considers a carboplatin/pacli taxel combination.159
However, due to the high rate of recurrent tumors (40% to 60%) and the low median OS of 16 to 
40 months post-diagnosis, UCS has a poor prognosis.160In persistent or recurrent disease, several 
drugs or combinations (including gemcitabine/docetaxel, thalido mide, imatinib, and sorafenib) 
have been tested as 2L therapy with no success.161,162,163,164For example, patients with recurrent 
disease who had previously failed 1 regimen of  chemotherapy wer e treated with gemcitabine and

docetaxel with 0% CR, 8.3% PR, and 33.3% SD with PFS of 1.8 months and OS of 4.9 months.161
Due to the aggressive nature of this disease, rarity, and limit ed therapeutic options in the 
relapsed/refractory stage, optimal manag ement of UCS is still not establis hed and novel 
therapeutic approaches are needed.165Approximately 41% of patients with UCS harbor MYC
amplifications, and BET inhibitors downregulate NF-κB activity that is required for 
TGF-β-mediated oncogenic signaling in UCS.166,167Thus, subjects with UCS harboring MYC
amplifications that relapsed or is refractory to 1L therapy w ill be eligible to participate in this 
study. 
NSCLC : Per NCCN guidelines , 1L treatment largely d epends on the stage and histology of 
NSCLC and includes surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy (eg  cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
combined with other regimens, including etoposide, docetaxel, b evacizumab, etc). For metastatic 
disease, treatment decisions are also based on molecular profil ing of tumors (ie, testing EGFR, 
ALK, ROS1, BRAF, and PD-L1), which allows the use of targeted t herapies as 1L treatment. The 
2L treatment options f or patients who progress on 1L therapy incl ude systemic therapies (eg, 
docetaxel, gemcitabine, and ramucirumab/docetaxel) and immune c heckpoint inhibitors (eg, 
nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab). Patients on 2L doc etaxel- or pemetrexed-based 
chemotherapy and erlotinib achieve ORR of approximately 8% to 10 %, PFS of 4 months, and
median OS of 8 to 10 months, whereas PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have s hown to prolong OS in 
pretreated patients.168,169Patients with 2L squamous-cell NSCLC treated with nivolumab or 
docetaxel achieve ORR of 20% or 9%, PFS of 3.5 months or 2.8 mon ths, and OS of 9.2 months or 
6.0 months, respectively.170In a similar setting, patients with nonsquamous-cell NSCLC trea ted 
with nivolumab or docetaxel achieved ORR of 19% or 12%, PFS of 2.3 months or 4.2 months, and 
OS of 12.2 months or 9.4 months, respectively.170Nevertheless, NSCLC remains a lethal disease,
and there is a need to investigate novel therapies. In pre-clin ical studies, BET inhibitor JQ1 exerts 
in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy in a subset of NSCLC ce lls harboring KRAS mutation; 
however, the activity of JQ1 in mutant KRAS NSCLC is abrog ated by concurrent alteration or 
genetic knockdown of LKB1.171In addition, BMS-986158 inhibits  proliferation of NSCLC cell 
lines with SWI/SNF mutations (BMS, data on file). Thus, subject s with NSCLC harboring 
mutations in the SWI/SNF complex or KRAS mutation with wild typ e LKB1 that progressed on 
or after 2L therapy will be eligible to participate in this stud y.
RCC: Surgical resection remains an effective therapy for clinicall y localized RCC. Patients with 
advanced or stage IV RCC can also be treated with s urgery if present with a solitary site of 
metastasis or solitary recurrence after nephrectomy. For patient s with metastatic RCC (mRCC), 
the prognosis rem ains poor and median OS ranges from 7.8 to 43.2 months depending on the 
adverse factor profiling. Tr eatment for relapsed or Stage IV disease and surgically unresec table 
mRCC is challenging.172For clear cell histology, 1L options include cytokine therapy (e g,
interleukin-2 [IL-2] and IFN) and targeted therapy (eg, pazopanib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus).

These drugs showed modest or no improvement in survival and hig h levels of toxicity. For 
example, frontline tr eatment of patients with bevacizumab or interfe ron alpha resulted in PFS of 
10.2 months versus 5.4 months, respectively, with marginal chang es in OS (23.3 months versus 
21.3 months, respectively).173In similar settings, pazopanib provided 9.2 months  PFS compared 
to 4.2 months with best supportive care.174As 2L therapy, NCCN recommends checkpoint 
inhibitors (eg, nivolumab) and anti-VEGF/ VEGFR therapy in additi on to cytokines and kinase 
inhibitors.175,176,177In patients with prior cytokine  treatment, sorafenib treatment resulted in 
5.5 months PFS (compared with 2.8 months for placebo) and 19.3 m onths OS (compared to 
15.5 months for placebo).178The best PFS outcome in the 2L setting was observed for lenvatinib,
with patients achieving 14.6 months PFS compared with 5.5 months on everolimus.179Because
metastatic RCC remains a lethal disease and SOC has not been established, t here is a need to 
investigate novel therapeutic approaches.176,180,181,182Preclinical studies demonstrated that BET 
inhibitor JQ1 suppre ssed RCC cell proliferat ion, induced cell a poptosis in vitro, and repressed 
tumor growth in vivo.23Notably, SWI/SNF and BET family function as co-regulators of ge ne 
transcription machinery.183Approximately 50% of patients carry mutations within the SWI/SN F 
complex.71Thus, subjects with metastatic RCC harboring mutations within the SWI/SNF complex 
that relapsed or is refractory to 2L therapy will be eligible to p articipate in this study.
UM: NCCN guidelines do not provide  a recommendation for UM treatm ent.184Currently, local 
1L treatment options include transpupillary thermotherapy, photo dynamic therapy, plaque 
radiotherapy, and proton beam radiotherapy for s mall and medium tumors. For more advanced 
tumors, enucleation and orbital exenteration are used as 1L trea tment options. However, 50% of 
patients treated lo cally will develop met astatic disease, with OS approximately 13 .4 months and 
only 8% surviving for 2 years. Several therapies have been teste d as 2L treatment, including 
dacarbazine, BCG, systemic interferon, selumetinib, and fotemust ine but have not reported 
promising results.185,186,187,188,189For example, patients with metastatic disease have been treated  
with the combinati on of d acarbazine and treosulfan with ORR 0%,  median PFS of 12 weeks and 
median OS of 30 weeks.186In another study, patients with metastatic disease were treated  with 
selumetinib or chemotherapy with PFS of 15.9 weeks and 7 weeks,  and ORR 49% and 0%, 
respectively.189A number of clinical studies are currently in progress evaluatin g safety and 
efficacy o f potential 1L and 2L therapies, including sunitinib, va lproic acid, dacarb azine/INFα-2b, 
crizotinib, and ipilimumab, and results have yet to be reported .190,191For patients with systemic 
metastasis, observation is usually  chosen because metastatic UM  is resistant to treatment, and there 
is no evidence that current treatment is able to extend survival .192,193Because half of patients will 
develop fatal metastatic disease, there is an urgent need to dev elop novel therapeutic options.191,192
Preclinical studies demonstrated that the BET inhibitor JQ1 has  cytotoxic activity in cells carrying 
Gnaq/11 mutations, a nd inhibits tumor growth in xenografts with  Gnaq-mutant UM cells.24
According to the TCGA database, 85% of patients with UM harbor Gnaq/11 mutations. Thus,

1.1.12 Rationale for QTc Objective
In this study, the effect of BMS-986158 on the QT interval will  be evaluated. Preclinical 
evaluations did not identi fy a signal indicating that BMS- 986158 may increase the QT inte rval or 
affect cardiac conduction. Similar to other drugs in this class , the likelihood BMS-986158 directly 
or indirectly affects QTc intervals is low. Despite the low ris k, such evaluation is required during 
the development of a therapeutic agent and the design of this s tudy treating subjects across several
doses is well suited for this type of evaluation. Serial electr ocardiograms (ECGs) (reviewed by a 
central laboratory) will be collected with matching PK samples from all subjects in dose escalation 
and at least 20 subjects treated at the MTD or an alternative s elected dose in the dose expansion 
monotherapy cohorts. 
1.1.13 Rationale for Inclusion of Adolescent Subjects
Exclusion of adolescent subjects from adult trials may slow the i nvestigation of novel therapies in 
adolescent subjects and delay t he delivery of novel efficacious  drugs to this patient population. 
Thus, it has been recommended to consider adolescent subjects for  tumor type- and molecular 
target-appropriate adult oncology trials.202
At the time of the clinical cutoff day 21-Dec- 2018, BMS-986158 was adminis tered to a total of 
81 subjects with various advanced cancers, including rare diseas es such as NMC and ES. Some of

these cancers, such as NMC, affect both children and adults. Wh ile NMC was initially thought to 
be a childhood cancer, recent studies have shown that it affect s people of all ages with 30% of new 
cases reported in pediatric patients.80Similar to adult patients, NMC is highly lethal in children 
and adolescent patients with an average of 10 months survival t ime, despite intensive 
therapies.203,80Thus, there is an unmet medical n eed for new ther apeutic approa ches for patients 
with NMC across all ages. During the dose escalation part of th is study, 1 subject with NMC with 
BRD3-NUT rearrangement responded to 2 mg BMS-986158 treatment b y reaching stable disease, 
characterized by 15% reduction in tumor burden and improved cli nical symptoms, including 
reduced pain. The duration of stable disease in this subject wa s 9 months. 
ES is a rare disease in adults and mostly affects children and adolescents, with a peak of incidence 
around 15 years.204Clinically, most pediatric patients present with lesions arisin g from the  bone, 
whereas more than 50% of lesions in adults occur in the soft ti ssue.205Early observations 
suggested an adverse prognosis for patie nts of older age,206whereas recent findings report no 
effect of age on OS.207The lower dose intensity of chemotherapy used to treat adults w as discussed 
as a possible factor.205Currently, the treatment of adult patients follows the same pri nciples as for 
ES in the pediatric age group.208,209Approximately 20% to 25% of ES patients are diagnosed with 
metastatic disease, and with current multimodality treatments, including chemotherapy and 
radiation, 5-year survival in this patient population is less t han 20%.209During the dose escalation 
part of this study, 1 subject with ES responded to BMS-986158 treatment with improved clinical 
symptoms, including reduced pain and increased overall activity . This observation supports 
previously published findings that BET inhibitors may affect su rvival of ES cells in preclinical 
models.63
During the dose expansion part of this study, BMS-986158 will i nitially be tested in subjects with 
TNBC, CRPC, DHL, non-GC-DLBCL, NMC and possibly other advanced cancers, including UM, 
RCC, NSCLC, and BL in the Subsequent Expansion. Except for BL, th ese cancers are rare in 
children.204,210,211,212,213BL is the most common (approximately 46%) non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
in children and adolescents in western countries, and rare in adults with approximately 1,200 cases
per year in the US.214,215A recent study reported that 5-year relative survival in BL for  children, 
adults, and the elderly were 90.4%, 47.8%, and 28.9%, respectiv ely. Some predictors of poor 
outcome were shared among all age groups, such as multiple pr imary tumor sites and advanced 
stage disease.216It was suggested that older patients have inferior outcomes com pared with 
younger patients due to the low intensity therapy, and one of t he ways to reduce treatment burden, 
especially in elderly patients, mig ht be the use of targeted the rapy approaches.214,215In both adults 
and children, relapse occurs infrequently but is characterized by a poor prognosis. Pe diatric 
patients who relapse or progress have chemotherapy-resistant di sease and can rarely be 
cured.217,218,219In adults, relapsed or refractory BL treated with salvage therap y resulted in median 
OS of 2.8 months.220Because patient  numbers are low, there are no randomized trials  comparing 
different relapse regimens. The se results provide rationale for development of alternative treatment

approaches focusing on targeted therapy to circumvent chemother apy-resistant disease by 
providing alternative therapeutic targets across different ages . 
Current experience with BMS-986158 (see Section 1.4.4 and the Investigator’s Brochure for 
details) did not identify drug-rel ated adverse events (AEs) tha t warrant exclusion of adolescent
subjects from this study. Thus, the balance of benefit to risk m ay be favorable in adolescent 
subjects with advanced cancers and poor treatment options. There fore, adolescent subjects with 
NMC, BL, or ES will be eligible to participate in this study. Additional indications will be allowed 
at the discretion of the Sponsor if the tumor contains similar ge netic abnormalities sensitive to 
regulation by the BET family proteins. 
Rationale for Adolescent Dose
BMS-986158
Analysis of available PK  data ind icates dose proportion ality and a linear r elationship between 
exposure a nd body s ize, allowing for appropriate scaling of dose to younger subjec ts using 
allometric scaling of clearance and volume. Current experience with  BMS-986158 demonstrates
that tested doses are safe in adult subjects. To provide an add itional margin of safety, the lower 
limit of enrollment will be 12 years of age. By 6 years of age,  developmental processes related to 
drug disposition are typically complete, a nd body weight is the main factor differentiating pediatric 
and adult drug exposures.221,222,223The PK results suggest that BMS-986158 exposure in 
adolescent subjects ≥40 kg could be similar to adults at the sa me dose level. Therefore, adolescent 
subjects ≥ 40 kg will be administered the same doses as adults a nd receive a starting dose of 4.5 mg 
for 2 weeks (10 doses) followed by  3.75 mg for t he remainder of  treatment in Schedule A. Due to 
the limited PK data collected in Part 1, only adolescents ≥40 k g will be e nrolled in Part 2. By 
enrolling subjects ≥40 kg, it is expected that around 50% of ad olescents will be eligible.
Nivolumab
Flat doses of nivolumab, 360 mg Q3W or 480 mg Q4W, have been sh own to be safe and 
efficacious in adult subjects. In adolescent subjects, 6 mg/kg d os e  Q 4 W  u p  to a  m ax i m u m  of  
480 mg will be used for the Schedule A dose expansion. The combin ation of BMS-986158 with 
nivolumab will only be pursued if results of the effect of BMS- 986158 monotherapy in the tumor 
microenvironment is favorable for the combination.1.2 Research Hypothesis 
There is no formal primary research hypothesis for this study to be statistically tested. It is 
anticipated that BMS-986158 as monotherapy and/or in combination with nivolumab will 
demonstrate adequate safety and tolerability at pharmacologically relevant doses, so as to permit further clinical development (at a recommended dose range).

1.4 Product Development Background
1.4.1 Pharmacology
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4.2 Toxicity
BMS-986158 is an inhibitor of the B ET reader of acetylated lysi ne residues on histone tails. The 
safety profile of BMS-986158 was established in 1-month intermit tent dose (5 days on/2 days off; 
4 cycles) oral toxicity stud ies in rats and dogs . The dog data we re used to calculate the MRSD for 
first-in-human clinical studies b ecause a nontole rated dose was attained in the dog but not the rat 
and the toxicity profiles were considered similar in both speci es.
In the pivotal 1-month oral study in rats,224BMS-986158 was administered by gavage at 0, 0.05, 
0.15, or 0.25 mg/kg, followed by a 3-week treatment-free recove ry period. In addition to standard 
toxicologic and toxicokinetic endpoints, pharmacodynamic blood biomarkers (mRNA) were 
assessed. BMS-986158 was clinically tolerated at doses ≤0.25 mg/kg. There were no BMS-
986158-related effects on physical (including neurologic and re spiratory evaluations) or 
ophthalmologic examinations. Additionally, there was no increas e in micronuclei frequency at 
≤0.25 mg/kg indicat ing that BMS-986158 was not genotoxic in the blood micronucleus assay.
BMS-986158-related clinical signs occurred only at the high dos e of 0.25 mg/kg beginning on 
Day 7 and included sporadic incidences of chromorhinorrhea, scan t feces, and soiling. Transient,
minimal mean body-weight losses at ≥0.15 (≤1.8%; females only )from Days 1 to 4 and reduced 
body-weight gain resulted in lower mean body weights (1.7% to 7.5% lower than controls) on 
Day 25. BMS-986158-related transient decreases in mean food consu mption occurred in males at
≥0.05 mg/kg and in females at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg. These clinical findings were considered 
nonadverse due to their low small magnitude or transient nature . 
BMS-986158-rel ated hematology changes were observed at all doses and those considered notable 
or toxicologically relevant included decreased white blood cell s (0.75 to 0.84× control), 
lymphocytes (0.74 to 0.85 ×), and eosinophils (0.54 to 0.61 ×) and decreased  platelets (0.49 to 
0.88×)with increased mean pl atelet volume (1.07 to 1.08× ). At ≥0.15 mg/kg, 
BMS-986158-related changes included decreased reticulocytes (0.3 3 to 0.76 ×); increased red cell 
distribution width (1.06 to 1.28 ×) and mean cell volume (1.04 ×) and decreased mean cell 
hemoglobin concentration (0.96 to 0.97 ×); and decreased segmented neutrophils, monocytes, and 
basophils (0.48 to 0.77 ×). At 0.25 mg/kg, additional findings included decreases in red  blood cells
(RBCs) and hemoglobin (0.92 to 0.93 ×). The hematology changes were attributed to bone marrow 
toxicity (with correlative decreased cellularity of the bone marrow; see below) or regenerative 
responses of the bone marrow to platelet and reticulocyte decre ases.
BMS-986158-related decreases in size and weight of the thymus a nd spleen with lymphoid 
depletion noted in both organs were observed generally at ≥0.15 mg/kg.
The primary BM S-986158-related microscopic changes at all doses include d: 1) minimal to 
moderate bone marrow hypocellularity and minimal lymphoid deple tion in the mesenteric or

mandibular ( ≥0.15 mg/kg) lymph nodes accompanied by minimally increased macro phage 
infiltration in the mesenteric lymph nodes at 0.25 mg/kg; 2) mi nimal epith elial si ngle- cell necrosis 
in various segments of the gastrointestinal tract; and 3) minim al to mild degeneration of the 
mammary gland in males. At the hi gh dose of 0.25 mg/kg, addition al microscopic findings 
included: 1) minimal lymphoid single-cell necrosis in the thymu s, 2) minimal decreases in Paneth-
cell granules in the jejunum; an d 3) minimal er osions, hemorrha ge, and mixed-cell or neutrophilic 
infiltration of the glandular mucosa of stomach.
Day 1 biomarker results at approximately 4 hours after dosing s uggested that inhibition of BET 
pathway resulted in transcriptional modulation including: 1) in creases in HEX1M1 and 2) 
decreases in ZMYND8 and MYC. These generally expected pharmacod ynamic biomarker results 
confirmed that BMS- 986158 binds and i nhibits brom odomains i n rats.
BMS-986158-related adverse target organ effects in rats were do se dependent and occurred in the 
bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, and gastrointestinal tr act, were gener ally more pro minent or 
severe in females than in males ( correlating with  higher system ic exposures in females at ≥
0.15 mg/kg), and were reversib le or partially rev ersible followi ng a 3-week post-dose recovery. 
The MTD was the high dose of 0.25 mg/kg (area under the concent ration-time curve 
[AUC]≤72.2 ng •h/mL, and a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was not id entified.
In the pivotal 1-month oral study in dogs,225BMS-986158 was administered i n gelatin capsules at
0, 0.07, 0.15, or 0.25 mg/kg, followed by a 3-week treatment-fr ee recovery period. In addition to 
standard toxicologic and toxicokinetic endpoints, pharmacodynam ic blood biomarkers (mRNA) 
were assessed. BMS-986158 was cl inically tol erated at doses ≤0.15 mg/kg. There were no 
BMS-86158-related clinical signs; no physical, ophthalmologic, or electrocardiographic findings; 
and no effects on food consumption, arterial oxygen saturation,  coagulation, or urinalysis 
parameters at ≤0.15 mg/kg. At a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, severe clinical toxicity re sulted in early 
euthanasia of all males and 1 female after 2 cycles of treatment (10 doses). Dosing was 
discontinued in the remaining 4 female dogs at 0.25 mg/kg. The poor condition of th ese dogs was 
attributed to pharmacologically mediated bone- marrow and gastroin testinal toxicities. 
At 0.15 mg/kg, minimal body-weight loss (4%) occurred in 1 male over the c ourse of the study. 
At 0.25 mg/kg, an increas ed incidence of sporadic fecal changes  (mucous, red, dark, black, blood 
or scant) began on Day 5 and progressed to include: moderate to  severe thrombocytopenia, reduced 
to no food consumption, dehydration, hunched posture, ulceration (mouth and perianal area), hemorrhage (gums), increased body temperature, and body-weight l oss in males (6.7% compared 
to 1% loss in controls) through Day 11.
BMS-986158-related findings at all doses were dose r elated in incidence and/or severity and 
included: 1) minimal to moderate seminiferous tubule degenerati on in testes with decreased testes 
weights absolute 14% to 20% at ≤0.15 mg/kg; no organ weight data were available at 0.25 mg/kg 
due to unscheduled euthanas ia); 2) minimal to m oderate cell debri s in the epididymides; and 3) 
minimal to marked bone-marrow hypocellularity. Decreases in spl een weights (15% to 39%) were 
noted at ≤0.15 mg/kg without any microscopic correlates.

At ≥0.15 mg/kg, additional BMS-986158-re lated findings that were ge nerally dose related in 
incidence and/or severity included: 1) decreased platelet count s (0.10 to 0.82× most recent pretest)
beginning on Day 7; 2) minimal to severe enteropathy of the small and/or large intestines that was 
characterized by 1 or more of the following: decreased numbers of goblet cells, crypt/gland 
dilatation, abscesses, and increased mitotic activity, flatteni ng, increased basophilia and/or single-
cell necrosis of crypt/gland enterocytes; and/or villous at rophy 3) min imal to mild e pithelial cell 
necrosis, secretory depletion, and marked hypospermia (at 0.15 m g/kg only) in the epididymides; 
4) minimal t o moderate RBCs in the sinuses of mesenteric lymph nodes that was a consequ ence 
of intestinal hemorrhage; 5) increased incidence and severity o f lymphoid depletion (mild to 
severe) in the thymus; and 6) min imal to moder ate lymphoid depleti on in the mandibular lymph 
nodes in males.
At the severely toxic dose of 0.25 mg/kg, additional BMS-986158- related findings included: 1) 
decreased reticulocytes (0.05 to 0.42 ×most recent pretest) with corresponding decreases in red 
cell distribution width (0.88 to 0.96 ×); 2) decreased eosinophils (≤ 0.41 ×) and lymphocytes
(0.16 to 0.41 ×); 3) mild hemorrhage or acute inflammation in the lungs and per icardium in males; 
4) minimal to marked erosions or ulcerations in the oral cavity, tongue, esophagus, stomach
(pylorus), and intestines; 5) moderate hemorrhage and/or severe  hematomas in the oral cavity and 
tongue in males; 6) minimal to mild acute inflammation in the e sophagus in males; 7) mild 
hemorrhage in the serosa of the stomach and capsular surface of t he spleen and surrounding 
adipose tissue; 8) mild  hemorrhage and/or minimal to moderate si ngle-cell necrosis of 
lymphocytes (in Peyer’s patches) in the small intestines; 9) mi nimal to moderate lymphoid 
depletion in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen in males; and 10) minimal pancreatic acinar 
cell necrosis with mild hemorrhage in 1 male.
In general, the decreased circulating reticulocytes, platelets,  lymphocytes, and eosinophils were 
attributable to bone marrow and lymphoid toxicities and c orrelated microscopically with bone 
marrow hypocellularity and cellular depletion in lymphoid tissu es. Hemorrhage and hematomas 
in multiple tissues at 0.25 mg/kg with corresponding necropsy fin dings of dark, brown-b lack, or 
red discoloration were related to the moderate to severe thrombo cytopenia associated with bone 
marrow toxicity. Mucosal erosions and ulceration in the gastroi ntestinal (GI) tract were
consequences of BMS-986158-related enteropathy that was consider ed to be pha rmacolo gically 
mediated because suppression of the BET protein BRD4 is known t o affect intestinal epithelial 
cell lineage differen tiation and reduce s tem cell numbers.226The degenerative changes in the testes 
with227reduced testicular weights were considered to be pharmacologica lly mediated as the testes-
specific BET protein BRDT is critical in male germ cell differe ntiation.
On Day 1, blood pharmacodynamic biomarker results at 4 hours po st dose indicated generally 
dose-dependent increases (up to approximately 3× control) in th e gene expression markers 
HEXIM1 and MKNK2 and decreases (down to approximately 0.2× cont rol) in ZMYND8 and 
MYC expression at all doses of BMS- 986158. At 24 hours postdose (D ay 1), gene expression 
parameters generally returned to control levels with the except ion of the ZMYND8 gene marker

at 0.25 mg/kg. Transcriptional modu lation of these biomarkers c onfirms that BMS-986158 binds 
and inhibits bromodomains in dogs.
BMS-986158-related changes observed during or after the 3-week r ecovery period included: 1) 
dose-related minimal to severe seminiferous tubule degeneration  at 0.07 and 0.15 mg/kg with 
decreased testes weights (absolute: 26% to 48%) and a correlati ve bilateral decrease in testes size

secretory depletion, and moderate hypospermia (0.15 mg/kg only)  in the epididymides. The 
absence of recovery for the testes and epididymal changes was e xpected given that a full 
spermatogenic cycle in the dog requires 8-9 weeks. Additional fi ndings at 0.25 mg/kg included: 
1) an increase in reticulocytes (3.49 ×most recent pretest) and a corresponding increase in red cell 
distribution width (1.17 ×) in 1 female on Day 35 that was likely a regenerative response  to bone-
marrow toxicity during the dosing phase; and 2) small increases  in serum blood urea nitrogen 
(1.44×), creatinine (1.52×), and phosphorus (1.57×) in 1 female  on Day 26
The primary target organs in dogs were the bone marrow with ass ociated hematology changes and 
testes/epididymides at all doses and the gastrointestinal tract  and lymphoid tissues at doses ≥0.15 
mg/kg. A dose of 0.15 m g/kg (AUC[0-T] 106 ng •h/mL) was considered the HNSTD for this study
and a NOAEL was not identified.
Telemeterized rats demonstrated mild increased heart rate (HR) (~50 bpm) and minimal decreased 
blood pressure (BP) (~5-10 mmHg) when administered BMS-986158 at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg (AUC[0-
24h] ≤220ng•h/mL; maximum observed concentration [Cmax] ≤32 ng/mL).228These effects 
were not dose related. Evaluations of potential BMS-986158-rela ted effects on the cardiovascular 
nervous, and respiratory systems were conducted as part of the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in rats (nervous, respiratory) and dogs (cardiovascular, nervous , respiratory).224,225There were no 
clear BMS-986158-related effects on these systems in these stud ies after 1-month repeat dosing 
(5 days on/ 2 days off; 20 doses total) at ≤0.25 mg/kg in rats (AUC ≤72.2 ng •h/mL; Cmax ≤13.8 
ng/mL) and ≤0.15 mg/kg in dogs (AUC ≤106 ng •h/mL; Cmax ≤19.5 ng/mL).
The potential effects of BMS-986158 on embryo-fetal development  were evaluated in an expanded 
dose range-finding study in pregnant rats.229BMS-986158 was administered daily by oral gavage 
to timed-mated female rats at 0, 0.05, 0.15, or 0.5 mg/kg from Gestation Day s (GD) 6 through 16, 
the period of organogenesis in this species. BMS-986158 was emb ryolethal at all tested doses. 
Specifically, there we re profound post-implan tation losses (manifested mainly as early 
resorptions) at all tested doses, 63.6% at 0.05 mg/kg/day and 100% at ≥ 0.15 mg/ kg/day. 
Additionally, in surviving fetuses at 0.05 mg/kg/day, the mean body weight was reduced (28% 
less than controls) and malformations (affecting tail, anus, an d/or viscera) occurred in 4 of 43 
(9.3%) fetuses from 2 of 8 (25%) litters. Based on the results f rom a previous rat toxicity 
study,230maternal AUC values at the lowest observed adverse effect level  (LOAEL) of 0.05 
mg/kg/day are expected to be 0.002× human exposures following a  single dose of 0.75 mg 
(AUCINF 4.102 μg•h/mL). Increased postimplantation loss has bee n reported in mouse embryos 
with BRD2 gene knocked out231or nullizygous for BRD4.232Moreover, in BRD4 heterozygous

mice, prenatal and postnatal growth retardations, malformations  of the eyes and bones, and other 
pathological abnormalities were noted.232Therefore, the developmental toxicity observed in litters 
of BMS-986158-treated dams is consistent with the pharmacologic al action of BMS- 986158.
BMS-986158 was negative for mutagenicity (exploratory b acterial-reverse mutation and in vitro 
clastogenicity).233,234BMS-986158 was not genotoxic in an oral rat micronucleus assay following 
intermittent (5 days of dosing followed by a 2-day dosing holid ay) dosing fo r 2 weeks (2 c ycles)
at doses ≤0.25 mg/kg.224
BMS-986158 was not phototoxic in rats administered single oral doses ≤ 1 mg/kg (Cmax ≤ 86.5 
ng/mL and AUC ≤ 379 ng•h/mL).235
BMS-986158 had no meaningful interaction with a broad spectrum of in vitro pharmacologic 
receptors, transporters, ion channels, nuclear hormone receptor s, or enzymes at 5 μg/mL.236In 
subsequent patch-clamp assays, (hERG, calcium, and sodium chann els), BMS-986158 produced 
a mild to moderate inhibition of cardiac hERG/IK2 potassium cha nnel (≤51.9% at ≤15 μg/mL), 
SCN5A sodium cha nnel (25.3% to 31.1% at 5.0 μg/mL), and L-type calcium cha nnel (41.7% at 
5.0 μg/mL).237The in vitro concentrations (up to 15 μg/mL) of BM S-986158 evaluated are 
substantially h igher (2083 to 125,000 ×) than the free Cmax in humans at the starting and ending 
Phase 1 doses.
In conclusion, the nonclinical t oxicity profile of BMS-986158 h as been well characterized and it 
supports first-in-human dosing in cancer patients.
1.4.3 Preclinical Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics
This section summarizes the data available from a series of in vitro and in vivo PK and metabolism 
studies that were conducte d with BMS-986158 in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys.
1.4.3.1 AbsorptionThe permeability coefficient (Pc) of BMS-986158 was high in bot h the Caco-2 cell assay (A-to-B 
Pc: 176 nm/sec, B-to-A Pc: 436 nm/sec) and parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (704 
nm/sec at pH 7.4), indicating high membrane permeability. After  oral administration of BMS-
986158, the time of peak plasma concentr ation (Tmax) ranged fro m 1 to 3.7 hours i n mice, rats, 
dogs and monkeys. The absolute oral bioavailability (F) from a solution formulation was ~100% 
(mouse), 47% (rat), 59% (dog), and 16% (monkey). After intraven ous (IV) administration, the 
apparent elimination half-life (T-HALF) of BMS-986158 was 1.9, 4. 2, 5.6 and 2.0 hours  for mice, 
rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively. 
The total plasma clearance (CLTp) of BMS-986158 was 12, 41, 15 and 32 (mL/min/ kg) in mice, 
rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively. 
BMS-986158 exhibited an efflux ratio (B-to-A Pc vs. A-to-B Pc) of ~3 at a nominal concentration 
of 3 μM, suggesting that BMS-986158 is likely a substrate of efflux t ransporter(s) such as 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. However, based on the existing animal data, efflux transporters 
do not appear to limit the oral absorption of BMS-986158 to a m eaningful extent.

The compound exhibited pH-dependent oral absorption in rats. Co administration of famotidine 
(25 mg/kg) reduced, the C maxand AUC of BMS-986158 (20 mg/kg administered-orally as a 
microsuspension), by 46% and 55%, respectively. However, this m ay represent the worst-case 
scenario, as the projected clinical dose and exposure are much lower than that used in the rat study.
1.4.3.2 Distribution
The steady-state volumes of  distribution of BMS-986158 in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys were
1.9, 4.3, 5.3, and 4.2 L/kg, respectively. 
At 10 μM, BMS-986158 was 96.1 ±0.1% bound to human serum  proteins and 84.2 to 90.2% 
bound to the serum proteins of the animal species studied. Cons istent with the difference in protein 
binding between humans and an imal species, the blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of 
BMS-986158 was low (0.57 ±0.002) in humans, whereas it was close to unity in an imal sp ecies. 
The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of BMS-986158 was about 0.99, 1.08, 1.19, and 1.15 in 
mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. These results sugges ted that the compound was 
distributed evenly between blood cells and plasma in preclinica l species, but not in humans.
1.4.3.3 Metabolism
The metabolic stability of BMS-986158 in human liver microsomes was lower than that in rat liver 
microsomes, but similar to that in d og and monkey liver microsomes (predicted intrinsic hepatic 
clearance [CLint] = 10 mL/min/ kg in humans, 12 to 72 mL/min/kg in animals).
Because no quantitative assays w ere available for most of the m etabolites except for Met5 
(BMT-161485), no discussion of the relative abundance is possibl e, other than for parent drug and 
BMT-161485.
Overall, BMS-986158 was found t o be relatively metabolically st able in vitro and in vivo in the 
animal species tested, except for monkey which exhibited relati vely faster turnover in vitro than 
in vivo. Sever al metabolites  were detected in hepatocyte incuba tes and in plasma of rat, dog, and 
monkey. General routes of biotransformation of BMS-986158 inclu ded:
•Mono-oxidation at the methyl of the triazole to form Met5 (BMT- 161485)
•Glucuronidation at the tertiary alcohol moiety to form Met4
•Mono-oxidation on the benzyl tetrahy dropyran moiety to form Met6, Met7
•Mono-oxidation on other parts of the molecule to form Met3, Met 12
•Further oxidation of Met5 to form Met8, Met9
•Glucuronidation of Met5, Met6, Met7 to form Met2, Met10, Met11
•Multiple oxidation to form Met1, Met13
The major in vitro oxidative met abolite for BMS-986158 in dog, m onkey, and human was 
BMT-161485, acc ounting for ~75% of total metabolites in human hepatocytes. In rodents, 
however, Met6 and Met7 were the major oxidative metabolites. In  monkey liver microsomes, 
BMT-161485 was further oxidized to Met8 and Met9. Met4 was high in monkey and rat

hepatocytes, but was minor in hu man hepatocytes (~20% of total metabolites). Met4 was not 
presented in dog hepatocytes. In rat hepatocytes, major metabol ites also included Met10/Met11. 
No glutathione adducts were detected in incubations supplemente d with glutathione. There was no 
human metabolite that was not formed in nonclinical species.
In vivo, BMS-986158 was detected in all 3 animal species as the major circulating drug-related 
component. BMT-161485 was the major circulating metabolite in d ogs and monkeys but not in 
rats. Met1 and Met3 were detected in dogs and monkeys, and Met6  and Met7 were detected in 
rats. Overall, the in vivo circulating metabolite profiles were consistent with in vitro profiles.
1.4.3.4 Excretion
Following a single 0.1-mg/kg IV dose of BMS-986158 to dogs, the f raction of dose recovered as 
unchanged BMS-986158 in the urine over 48 hours was < 1%, demon strating that renal clearance 
is not a meaningful systemic clearance pathway for BMS-986158 i n dogs.
1.4.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions
In vitro metabolic reaction phenotyp ing studies, using individu ally expressed recombinant human 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, demonstrated that the oxidative metabolism of  BMS-986158 
was primarily mediated by CYP3A4  (66%) and CYP3A5 (23%). Furthe rmore, reaction 
phenotyping studies with recombinant human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 
enzymes demonstrated that the glucuronidation of BMS-986158 is primarily mediated via 
UGT1A4, with minor contribution by UGT2B17. These data suggest that the potential exists for 
drug-drug interactions if BMS-986158 is co-administered with an inhibitor or inducer of these 
enzymes.
Inhibition of CYP enzymes by BM S-986158 in human liver microsomes was minimal (IC50 > 40 
μM), except for CYP2C9 (IC50 = 8.4 μM). The IC50 for recombinant hUGT1A1 was 3 μM. In 
addition, BM S-986158 (up to 40 μM) neither transactivated the human pregnane-X receptor nor 
induced CYP3A4, CYP2B6, or CYP1A2 m RNA expressio n and activity in cryopreserved primary 
human hepatocytes. Therefore, the DDI potential of BMS-986158 a s an inhibitor of metabolic 
enzymes and transporters is minimal, based on the currently pro jected therapeutic dose and 
exposure (Cmax 0.082 μM at 11 mg once-a-day).
1.4.4 Clinical Pharmacology and Safety
The current study is a first-in-human study. 
At the time of the clinical data cutoff d ate of 21-Dec-2018, a total of  81 subjects had received at 
least 1 dose of BMS-986158 in Part  1 of the study under Schedule  A, Schedule B or Schedule C. 
Each subject was administere d a single dose of BMS -986158 on Cycle 1 Day 1 (4- to 7-day cycle), 
and no additional doses were administered until Cycle 2 Day 1. On Cycle 2 Day 1 and each 
subsequent cycle, subjects in Schedule A received once daily (QD) dosing for 5 consecutive days, 
followed by a 2-day rest period repeated weekly on a 28-day cyc le. Subjects in Schedule B 
received QD dosing for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day  rest period on a 21-day cycle 
and subjects in Schedule C received QD dosing for 7 consecutive  days, followed by a 14-day rest 
period on a 21-day cycle. In Schedule A, a total of 44 subjects  have received QD dosing of 0.75 mg

received QD dosing of 2 mg (n=6), 3 mg (n=12) or 4.5 mg (n=11) B MS-986158. All clinical data 
are preliminary and subject to change. 
As of 21-Dec-2018, a total of 79 subjects (97.5%) experienced a t least 1 AE. The most frequent 
AEs (occurring in ≥20% of subjects) were diarrhea (49 [60.5%] subjects), nausea (4 3 [53.1%] 
subjects), fatigue (41 [50.6%] subjects), decreased appetite (3 4 [42.0%] subjects), vomiting (34
[42.0%] subjects), thrombocytopenia (32 [39.5%] subjects), dysp noea (23 [28.4%] subjects), 
anemia (19 [23.5%] subjects), constipation (19 [23.5%] subjects), and cough (17 [21.0%] 
subjects). A total of 49 subjects (60.5%) experienced Grade 3 t o 4 AEs. Five subjects (6.2%) 
experienced Grade 5 AEs, all assessed by both Sponsor and inves tigator to be not related to 
BMS-986158.
Adverse events evaluated as related to BMS-986158 were experien ced by 59 of 81 subjects 
(72.8%). Thirty-four subjects (42%) experienced diarrhea with no ne experiencing Grade 3 to 4 
diarrhea. Thirty subjects (37%) experienced treatment-related t hrombocytopenia including 
17 subjects (21.0%) with either Grade 3 or 4 events. Thirteen su bjects (16%) were reported to have 
nausea, including 1 (1.2%) Grade 3 nausea. Other Grade 3 to 4 t reatment-related AEs include 
anemia (3 [3.7%] subjects), vomiting, fatigue, increased biliru bin (2 [2.5%] subjects each), and 
neutropenia and vertigo (1 [1.2%] s ubject each). There were no treatment-related AE’s of Grade 5 
reported.No treatment-r elated deaths have been reported in any treatment cohort of Stu dy CA011-001. Nine 
deaths were reported in participants treated with BMS-986158 mo notherapy within 30 days of last 
dose. Of the 9 deaths, 8 deaths were reported as secondary to disease and 1 due to cerebrovascular 
accident; all of which were considered not related to BMS-98615 8 treatment.
A total of 68 subjects were discontinued from study tr eatment due to di sease progression.
A detailed description of BMS-986158 safety is provided in the IB.
1.4.4.1 Pharmacokinetics of BMS-986158
BMS-986158
Interim noncompartmental PK analyses were conducted on BMS-9861 58 (parent) and 
BMT-161485 (metabolite) using samples from the monotherapy portion of the study
administration of 0.75, 1.25, 2, 3, and 4.5 mg oral doses of BMS-986158 following single and 
multiple doses using nominal time and examining continuous and intermittent schedules 
(Schedules A and C, respectively).
Interim PK results indicate that BMS-986158 is moderately to ra pidly absorbed (Tmax range: 
0.5 to 4 hours) following single dose administration at doses of  0.75 to 4.5 mg. The exposure 
within the dose range examined appears to increase with increas ing dose. From these multiple 
dosing data, a peak to trough ratio of approximately 2.4 and an  accumulation index of 
approximately  1.97 were determined. The inter- and intra-subject variability was from low to high.

PK parameters of BMS-986158 using nominal sample times show tha t the overall exposure was 
significantly higher than predicted. This higher than predicted  human exposure may have resulted 
from, and is consistent with a lower than anticipated clearance  and increased serum protein binding 
in humans. Preclinical determinations of human serum protein bi nding indicated a 3.9% free 
fraction for BMS- 986158. In terim data from ex vivo plasma sampl es collected from the 6 subjects 
at the 2 mg dose on this study showed mean free drug fractions o f 0.1% to 0.2% with s mall to 
moderate intra- and inter-subject variability that were not concentration dependent. It is postulated 
that the unexpectedly low free fraction resulted in the low cle arance. 
The metabolite (BMT-161485) exhib ited a similar terminal phase e limination as the parent drug, 
suggesting formation rate limited PK of BMT-161485. Plasma conc entrations of metabolite were 
low relative to the plasma concentration of the parent drug wit h exposure ratios less than 30%. The 
metabolite ha s potency that is approximately 10-fold weaker tha n the parent drug.
Preclinical data suggests that BMS-986158 is metabolized in the  liver by CYP3A4 mediated 
oxidation to a hydroxylated metabolite; it also undergoes glucu ronidation. BMS-986158 is a 
substrate of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of P-gp and transporters. 
1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Many cancers are driven by MYC pathway and BRD4 super enhancer a ctivation, providing a solid 
rationale for the trial of BET inhibitors as suppressors of BRD4  and MYC in multiple tumor 
types.9,15Preclinical studies have linked repression of MYC and other onc ogenes to tumor cell 
death and tumor regression in both solid tumors and hematologic  cancer models, following BET 
inhibition.8,9,10 ,BRD4 amplification and overexpressi on has been correlated with adverse 
prognostic information.19
Sixteen other BET inhibitors have entered Phase 1/2 clinical tria ls, and 24 studies focused on solid 
tumors and hematological malignancies are recruiting patients o r are completed as listed in 
clinicaltrials.gov.
Results from most studies have not been reported. Preliminary c linical data is available on the 
OTX-015/MK-8628 Phase 1 study in leukemia which shows that no DLT s were observed in 28
evaluable subjects with AML, ALL, and refractory anemia (RA) thro ugh dose level (DL) 5 (120 
mg QD). At DL6 (160 mg QD), MTD was exceeded with 1 patient exp eriencing grade 3 diarrhea 
and another grade 3 fatigue and anorexia.44The main toxicities were non-cumulative grade 
1-2 gastrointestinal events (6 patients diarrhea, 3 dysgueusia, 3 abdominal pain, 3 nausea, 
1 anorexia), hyperglycemia (3 patients), coagulation factor VII decrease (6 patients) and direct 
bilirubin increase (3 patients) (two latter AEs asymptomatic). These toxicities were mainly 
observed at QD doses above 80 mg and with 40 mg BID. Clinically  relevant activity was reported 
in 5 AML patients treated at 10, 40 and 80 mg, including one su stained CR from cycle 4 to cycle
12 (40 mg QD) and one CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp ) from cycle 2 to cycle 5 (80 
mg QD).44Preliminary clinical data is also available on OTX015/MK-8628 Ph  1 study in Non-
Leukemic Hematologic Malignancies.45In this study, 37 non-leukemic  patients (18 diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL], 9 other lymphomas, 10 myelo ma) were treated over 5 dose levels, 33

of whom were evaluable for DLT. No DLTs were observed through D L4 (80 mg QD). Reversible 
grade 4 thrombocytopenia was the DLT at DL4 BID (40 mg x2) and 120 mg QD continuous.
Sixteen patients experienced Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and 3 p atients had grade 3-4 
neutropenia. Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities were diarrhea, vomiting, hyperglycemia, and 
hypernatremia (1 patient each). Other toxicities were non-cumulative grade 1-2 gastrointestinal 
events (8 patients with diarrhea, 3 dysgueusia, 2 vomiting, 1 na usea, 1 anorexia, 1 abdominal pain), 
hyperglycemia (7 patients), skin rash (3 patients), asymptomatic coagulation factor VII decrease 
(2 patients), and direct bilirubin increase (1 patient). Clinic ally r elevant activity was re ported in 
6 patients treated from 40 to 120 mg, including one CR (120 mg, 1 7+ weeks [wks]) and 1 PR 
(80 mg, 28 wks), both in DLBCL patients failing 3-4 prior therapy  lines, and both with clinical 
benefit. Four other patients (two with DLBCL, one follicular, a nd one lymphoplasmacytic 
lymphoma) had minor tumor shrinkage with clinical benefit (40 m g, 36+ wks; 80 mg, 14 wks; 120 
mg 15 wks; 120 mg, 17 wks). Similarl y, a study using another BET inhibitor, CPI-0610, as
monotherapy reported obj ective clinical responses in 5 of 36 sub jects with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL, specifically in T cell/histocyte-ric h and activated B-cell  subtypes. Of note was 1 CR and 
2 PR in subjects with ABC-DLBCL, 1 PR in follicular lymphoma, a nd 1 PR in T-cell histocyte 
rich lymphoma.77
The initial assessment of the risk of side eff ects of BMS-986158 in clinical trials was based on
data from non clinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs. Those studies primarily demonstrated
the expected toxicity profile of BET inhibition, with most toxi city shown in the highly proliferative 
cell populations of the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. An additional toxicity o bserved in 
the rat but not dog was mammary gland atr ophy in males. An additional toxicity observed in the 
dog but not rat was testicular degeneration. An additional toxi city finding observed in pregnant 
rats demonstrated embryo lethality and teratogen icity. A detailed description o f these toxicities is 
provided in Section 1.4.2 and in the Investigational Brochure. The GI and bone marrow toxi cities 
were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.
The nonclinical toxicity profile was used to determine the star ting dose and to develop appropriate 
exclusion criteria, contraception measures for male and female participants, and safety monitoring 
for this study. In addition t o frequent complete blood counts (C BCs) and chemistry (including liver 
enzyme) tests, because of the potential effect of immune system repression, subjects with viral 
infection (Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], Hepatitis B or C ) are excluded and lymphocyte 
numbers are monitored regularly. Imm unoglobulin levels are also followed routinely to evaluate 
the potential need for supplementation. Although the nonclinica l in vitro and in vivo assessments 
have not demonstrated any cardiova scular liability, electrocard iograms (ECG) are being monitored 
frequently. Subjects will be evaluated frequently by physical ex am; their weights are being closely 
monitored, and they are being assessed for the development of d iarrhea or other anticipated GI 
symptoms. Guidelines for the management of diarrhea are provided  in Section 4.5.3 . 
As of the data cutoff date  on 21-Dec-2018, preliminary clinical data from the first-in-human 
CA011001 monothera py study in subjects with advanced solid tumo rs have demonstrated that 
BMS-986158 has an acceptable toxicit y prof ile in 81 subjects treated at all dose levels in Schedule 
A (0.75, 1.25, 2, 3, and 4.5 mg), Schedule B (2 and 3 mg) and Schedule C (2, 3, and 4.5 mg). All

observed toxicities in the GI or hematopoietic system reversed spontaneously or upon drug 
withdrawal. To date, the cumulative human safety data are consi stent with the non-clinical
assessment of toxicity in rats and dogs and support the continu ed clinical exploration of BMS-
986158 for the treatment of a variety of malignancies. 
Although BMS-986158 does not demonstrate evidence of genotoxici ty, perturbation of cellular 
differentiation pathways may contribute to development of cancer. Subjects are informed of the 
potential risk, and are carefully evaluated by the investigator s throughout the st udy. Subjects are 
counseled on appropriate contraceptive measures, while on study  and for at least 3 months after 
the last dose of BMS-986158. Addi tionally, sub jects are informe d of the potential risks to 
reproductive organs and the option of sperm or egg banking disc ussed, if appropriate.
The frequent safety assessments are utilized by the Sponsor/Med ical Monitor and investigators to 
determine whether dose modification, additional safety measures , or termination of the study is 
required at any time. Thorough evaluation of the above-describe d safety monitoring procedures 
and of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) are reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor and Global Phar macovigilance and Epidemiology r epresentatives to monitor for 
any safety signals or trends.
As BMS-986158 is an experimental agent, it is possible that unf oreseen, unknown, or 
unanticipated reactions may occur. Five serious, unexpected ser ious adverse events have been 
reported with BMS-986158; 4 of them were assessed to be related to study drug. Two subjects 
experienced Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 1 subject experienced Grade 3 vertigo and another subject 
experienced myocardial infarction. One subject experienced anemi a, which was assessed not to be 
related to BMS-986158.
However, based on the nonclinical safety and toxi city p rofile of BMS-986158 observed with tested 
doses in Schedules A, B, and C, the potential safety risks are e xpected to be minimized, following 
the planned cautious dose escalation scheme. An urgent need exists for new therapies for subjects 
with advanced cancer that has progressed or not responded to ot her treatments. Pharmacologically-
active dosing has been achieved at the 4.5 mg dose level in Sch edule A. Thus, there may be 
potential benefits to study subjects with BMS-986158 monotherapy treatment. In addition, based 
upon potential synergistic effect,25a combination of BMS-986158 wi th nivolumab may provide 
potential additional benefit but will be pursued only after the effects of BMS-986158 on the tumor 
microenvironment have been characterized. Furthermore, the subst antial nonclin ical eff icacy 
profile (see Section 1.4.2 ) and the growing evidence  for MYC and BRD4 ta rgeting in many hum an 
cancers (see Section 1.1.3 ), indicates that the balance of benefit to risk is likely to be favorable for 
study subjects.
This study may allow the characterization of the safety and clin ical activity of nivolumab in 
combination with BMS-986158 depending on the information ob tained in the monotherapy dose 
expansion cohorts and provide an estimate of the clinical benef it as measured by ORR in subjects 
with advanced cancers associated with genetic abnormalities, in cluding 1) amplif ications of BRD, 
MYC, or AR genes; or 2) mutations in Gnaq/11, KRAS, or SWI/ SNF; or 3) translocations of MYC, 
BCL2/6, or NUT.

3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase 1/2a, open label study to characterize the safe ty and tolerab ility of B MS-986158 
monotherapy and/or in combination with nivolumab in subjects wi th advanced solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies. The study has two segments: Part 1 (P hase 1 study - dose escalation, 
with Schedules A, B and C enrolling at different dosing schedul es) and Part 2 (Initial Expansion 
including subjects with a limited set of tumor types followed by  Subsequent Expansion including
subjects with an expanded set of tumor types) (see Figure 3.1-1 ). In Part 1, BM S-986158 will be 
studied as monotherapy, and in  Part 2, BMS-986158 will be studie d as monotherapy and may be 
administered in combination with nivolumab depending on  
available data from the monotherapy-treated subjects.

The planned sample size consists of up to approximately 90 subje cts for Part 1 and up to 
approximately  327 sub jects for Part 2 for a total of up to appr oximately 417 subjects in the entire 
study.
In Part 1, the continuous dosing Schedule A enrolled first. Each subject in Schedules A, B and C 
of Part 1 is administered a s ingle dose of BMS-986158 on Cycle 1 Day 1 and no additional doses 
are administered until Cycle 2 Day 1. For subjects in Schedule A on Cycle 2 Day 1, which must 
be within approximately 7 days of the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose administ ration, and on each subsequent 
cycle, subjects receive QD dosing for 5 consecutive days of each  week, followed by a 2-day rest 
period, on a 28-day cy cle. For subjects in Schedule B on Cycle 2 Day 1, which must be  within 
approximately 7 days of the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose administration, and on each subsequent cycle, 
subjects receive QD dosing for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day rest period, on a 21-day 
cycle. For subjects in Schedu le C on Cycle 2 Day 1, which must b e within approximately 7 days 
of the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose administration, and on each subsequent cycle, subjects receive QD
dosing for 7 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day rest period , on a 21-day cycle. Subjects may 
continue to receive tr eatment until disease progression, unacceptable AEs or withdraw al of 
consent.
In Part 2, Schedule A for BMS-986158 administration has been sel ected for expansion of the 
4.5 mg dose, which will be administered for 2 weeks (10 doses) f ollowed by 3.75 mg for the 
remainder of the treatment period. Adult and adolescent subjects  weighing ≥40 kg will be 
administered a flat dose of BMS-986158 (see Section 1.1.13 ). Using Schedule A with a loading 
period of  2 weeks at 4.5 m g followe d by 3.75 mg for the remainder of the treatment period, BMS-
986158 will be tested as monotherapy, initially in a limited se t of tumor types (NMC, CRPC, DHL, 
Non-DC-DLBCL, and TNBC; Initial Expansion), with Subsequent Exp ansion into additional 
tumor types upon observing signals of antitumor activity or fa vorable PD effects in the init ial set 
of tumor types. If combin ation therapy is pursued, nivolu mab will be admin istered as a f lat dose 
of 480 mg Q4W in adults  and BMS-986158 will be administered usi ng Schedule A.
Further dose modification at the subject level is permitted bel ow the dose level of 3.75 mg 
depending on the observed toxicity and tolerability (see guidel ines for dose modification in Section
4.5.2 ).
Subjects will complete up to 5 study periods (See Figure 3.1-2 ): Screening (up to 28 days for Part 
1 and up to 40 days for Part 2), Treatment (up to 2 years, unti l disease progression or other protocol-
specified criteria), Clinical Follow-up (30 days for BMS-986158 mo notherapy and 30 days, 
60 days, and 100 days for combination therapy, if pursued), and Su rvival Follow-up  
 
.  
Only subjects who 
have progressive disease after receiving BMS-986158 in combinat ion with nivolumab may have 
the option to continue treatment with the combination if combin ation therapy is pursued. Subjects 
who have progressive disease after receiving BMS-986158 monothe rapy will not have the option 
to continue treatment with BMS-986158 monotherapy or to receive  BMS-986158 in combination 
with nivolumab.

Safety, PK,  and efficacy measurements will occur as indicated in Table 5.1-1 , 
Table 5.1-2 Table 5.1-3 , Table 5.1-4 , Table 5.1-5 , and Table 5.1-6 . Pre- and on-tr eatment biopsies 
will be required for all adult subjects enrolled in Part 2 to all ow the assessment of BMS-986158-
induced changes in tumor immune infiltration  
 
 
The overall duration of the study is expected to be approximate ly 4 years from the time of the first 
visit of the first subject to t he required survival follow- up of the last subject e nrolled. Subjects may 
discontinue treatment due t o disease progression, unacceptable AEs, or withdrawal of consent. The 
Clinical Follow-up visits will occur approximately 30 days (for su bjects who receive 
monotherapy), and 60 days and 100 da ys (for subjects who may recei ve combination therapy) after 
the subject discontinues study  treatment. For s ubjects in PR or CR who discontinue treatment for 
AEs, tumor assessments will be performed every 12 weeks for the  first year then every 6 months 
for the second year. If a subject discontinues treatment due to  an AE, the subject should be seen in 
Clinical Follo w-up every 30 days until the AEs either resolved to baseline or Grade 1, stabilized, 
or been deemed irreversible. After completing the Clinical Follo w-up Period, sub jects will 
continue on to a Survival Follow-up Period.  
 
 
 
 The end of the 
study will occur afte r the last treated subject completes their  Clinical Follow-up, unless a subject 
discontinues prematurely.

3.1.1 Monotherapy Dose Escalation (Part 1)
In Part 1 (dose escalation), BMS-986158 is administered as monot herapy (Schedules A, B and C). 
The study design schematics are presented in Figure 3.1-1 and Figure 3.1-2.
To minimize risks to subjects from unanticipated acute toxiciti es, a waiting period of at least 5 
days will occur between administrations of the first dose for th e first, second, and third subjects to 
create an observation period prior to subsequent subject exposu res. This waiting period is 
mandatory only in the first Cohort of Schedule A of Part 1.
Part 1: Selection of Doses
In Schedule A of Part 1, the first  cohort of subjects received a starting dose of 0.75 mg. In this 
schedule, each subject was administered a single dose of BMS-9861 58 on Cycle 1 Day 1 (4-to 7-
day cycle) and no additional doses were administered until Cycle  2 Day 1. On Cycle 2 Day 1, 
which must be within 7 days of the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose administr ation, and on each subsequent 
cycle, subjects received QD dosing for 5 consecutive days of each  week, followed by a 2-day rest 
period, on a 28-day cy cle. The second cohort of subjects on this schedule received a d ose of 
1.25 mg. This dose level (a 67% increase) was chosen instead of 1. 5 mg dose level (a 100% 
increase) because of the longer than expected half-life that was calculated based on human 
exposure data from the first cohort of (n=5) subjects evaluated a t the 0.75 mg dose level.
For Schedule B, each subject is administered a single dose of BM S-986158 on Cycle 1 Day 1 
(7-day cycle) and no additional doses are administered un til Cycle 2 Day 1. On  Cycle 2 Day 1, 
and on each subsequent cycle, subjects receive QD dosing for 14 c onsecutive days, followed by a 
7-day rest period, on a 21-day cycle. For Schedule C, subjects a re administered a single dose of 
BMS-986158 on Cycle 1 Day 1 (7-day cycle) and no additional dos es are administered until Cycle 
2 Day 1. A schedule of 7 days  on, 14 days off may be implemented beginning with Cycle 2 Day 1 
and on each subsequent cycle, if agreed upon by the Sponsor/Medi cal Monitor and investigators.
Refer to Figure 3.1-2 and Section 4 . Subjects enrolled previously in Part 1 who are st ill receiving

therapy will continue to be dosed on their original schedule. Subjects may continue to receive 
treatment un til disease progression, unacceptable AEs or withdrawal of cons ent, or as defined in 
Section 3.5 . 
Dose escalation for each subsequent cohort of subjects in each of the schedules will be guided by 
the incidence of AEs for which no clear alternative cause is id entified as graded by National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events versio n 4.03 (N CI CTCAE v4.03) in 
the first 32-35 days of dosing for Schedule A of Part 1. Dose es calation will be in increments of 
100% above the previous dose level until the first occurrence o f any of the  following toxicities that 
have no alternate cause: a ny DLT (as de scribed in Section 4.5.1 ), any ≥Grade 2 toxicities with the 
following exceptions: Grade 2 fatigue, Grade 2 alopecia.
Once one or more of the above identified DLTs occurs, a modified Fibonacci dose escalation 
schema will be employed for any subsequent dose escalations at that  schedule, with increments of 
67%, 50%, 40%, and 33%. Any furthe r dose escalations will be 33%. In addition, dose 
modification could also include changes in the dosing interval (e.g. twice weekly) based on 
available safety and PK data.
Intermediate doses may be evaluated if agreed upon by the Sponso r/Medical Monitor and 
investigators. The next dose level will not exceed 100% or the dose increment per the modified 
Fibonacci dose escalation schema.

Enrollment in dose escalation and selection of the MTD will adhe re to a mTPI design. The design 
provides a simple algorith m for decisions on es calation, expanding at the same dose, and 
de-escalation, depending on the number of observed toxicities a fter each dose cohort (see Figure 
3.1.1-1 ). The mTPI method utilizes a target toxicity (DLT) rate and equ ivalence interval to guide
decisions on escalation afte r each cohort and to estimate the M TD. For this study, the target DLT 
rate is 27% and the EI is 25%-29%.
Dose escalation decisions will be guided by the cumulative numb er of subjects who are DLT 
evaluable and who experience a DLT in the DLT Evaluation Period f or all arms (Figure 3.1.1-1
and Appendix 1 ). If no DLTs are observed in the first dose cohort of Part 1, 3 -4 subjects will be 
enrolled at the next higher dose level. If 1 DLT is observed in 3 or 4 evaluable subjects, this dose 
level will be expanded by enrolling another cohort of 3-4 at th e same dose level. If 2 of 3 or 3 of 
4 subjects are observed wit h DLTs, the next cohort w ill be e nrolled at the next lower dose level. 
Additional decisions are shown in Figure 3.1.1-1 and Appendix 1. If a decision to treat more subjects at a given dose level is suggested by the mTPI algorithm when there are already at least 13 DLT evaluable subjects treated at the same dose level, a nee d for further enrollment in the dose 
escalation phase will be  determined by the S ponsor. These same rules w ill be applied to 
Schedules B and C. A total of approximately 30 DLT evaluable sub jects is expected to be treated 
per schedule with a total of 90 planned across schedules for th e dose escalation phase. 
Decisions to escalate, add more subjects to the current dose, d e-escalate (with options to 
re-escalate), or de -escalate and declare the current dose as un acceptable (exceeding the MTD), will 
be based on the rate of DLTs in evaluable subjects within the 3 2-35-day DLT evaluation period of
Schedule A for Part 1, and within the 35-day DLT evaluation perio d of Schedules B and C for 
Part 1 (Appendix 1). At least 3 DLT-evaluated subjects treated at each dose level are required to 
enable a decision. To account for sub jects who may not be able to complete the DLT evaluation 
period, for reasons other than a DLT , or may not be evaluable for DLT, a fourth sub ject may be 
enrolled at this dose level, following agr eement between the investigator and Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor. 
DLT-evaluable subjects are defined as subjects who received at le ast 16 of 21 doses of 
BMS-986158 in Schedule A of Part 1; at least 17 of 22 doses of BMS- 986158 in Schedule B of 
Part 1; and at least 12 of 15 doses in Schedule C  of Part 1 during the DLT evaluation period and 
will be considered fo r dose escalation decisions. Subjects who developed a DLT during the DLT 
period are considered evaluable regardless of the number of rec eived doses. Subjects with 
insufficient data to establish safety during the DLT evaluation  period at the dose level tested may 
be replaced upon agreement of the Sponsor/Medical Monitor and i nvestigators.
There will be no intrasubject dose escalation of BMS-986158.Figure 3.1.1 -1 shows examples of scenarios guiding d ecisions that may be encountered during 
dose escalation with respect to the numbe r of DLT evaluable sub jects and the number of subjects 
with a DLT. All  potential combinations o f the number of subject s with DLTs and number of treated 
subjects evaluable for DLT are shown in Protocol Appendix 1. In  addition to escalation or 
expansion decisions, dose re-escalation is permitted as per Fig ure 3.1.1-1 a nd Appendix 1 after a

decision to de-escalate is made, except when a dose level has be en identified as exceeding the 
MTD. Therefore, a dose level could be revisited multiple times under the mTPI design.
In addition to the guide for escalation decisions, to better as sess if a dose level is safe given the 
number of DLTs observed, posterior probabilities of the DLT rat e are provided in Section 8.1 to 
inform decisions regarding dose safety. 
Part 1: MTD Determination
At the end of dose es calation, the MTD for each evaluated dosing schedule (Schedules A , B, and C) 
will be s elected as the dose with the smaller difference between estimated toxicity and the target 
DLT rate (27%), among the dose levels used, with an isotonic regr ession model of the accumulated 
DLT data based on the mTPI design ( Appendix 1).
3.1.2 Dose Expansion (Part 2)
Treatment in Part 2 can be initiated before Part 1 is completed and when the MTD or maximum 
administered dose (MAD), i f no MTD is r eached for Part 1, has been determined. Schedule A (QD 
dosing for 5 consecutive days of each week, followed by a 2-day  rest period, on a 28-day cycle) 
has been chosen for expansion. This regimen was selected after c onsidering safety, PK  
 data generated during Part 1 (see Section 1.1.5 ). The initial dose level 
of BMS-986158 selected for Part 2 is 4.5 mg with a loading peri od of  2 weeks (10 doses or half a 
cycle) with subsequent dose le vel of 3.75 mg fo r the duration o f study treatment for each subject. 
Adult and adolescent subjects weighing ≥40 kg will be administered a flat dose of BMS-986158. 
Further dose modification at the subject level is permitted bel ow the dose level of 3.75 mg 
depending on the observed toxicity and tolerab ility (see guidelines for dose modification in Section  
4.5.2 ).
BMS-986158 will be first evaluated a s monotherapy. The Initial Expansion will e nroll a maximum 
of 45 subjects with tumors harboring specific genetic alterations  including fusion proteins (NMC, 
DHL), BRD amplifications (TNBC), MYC amplifications (Non-GC DLB CL) and AR 
amplification (CRPC).  
 
 
 
Depending on the 
safety, preliminary efficacy, tolerability, 
 
 a Subsequent Expansion will enroll up to 126 subjects with  tum or types already evaluated 
in the Initial Expansion as well additional tumor types within and across groups of specific genetic 
alterations. Categories of genetic alterations and tumors under  consideration for the Subsequent 
Expansion include fusion proteins (NMC, DHL, ES and BL), BRD amp lifications (TNBC, OC 
and NEPC), MYC amplifications (Non-GC DLBCL, UCS, OC), AR amplif ication (CRPC) and 
mutations (RCC, NSCLC and UM). See Figure 3.1-1 . 
The decision to assign new cohorts of subjects to BMS-986158 pl us nivolumab combination 
therapy will be made upon agreement between the Sponsor/Medical  Monitor and investigators

after review of  available da ta obtained from both init ial and 
subsequently enrolled monotherapy expansion subjects. If combin ation therapy of BMS-986158 
and nivolumab is pursued, subjects may be enrolled with any of the tumors types listed in Figure 
3.1-1 . The tumor types enrolled will depend on the activity of BMS-9 86158 monotherapy within 
and across biomarker groups. Based on the results of Part 2, in cluding PK  
, discussion between Sponsor/Medical Monitor and the investigators, and additional 
considerations, enrollment ma y be initiated for other indicatio ns not listed in Figure 3.1-1 as long 
as subjects meet the specified inclusion criteria (see Section 3.3.1 ). Up to approximately 
327 subjects will be treated in the dose-expansion phase (Part 2 ) of this study
3.1.2.1 Safety Evaluation Phase of BMS-986158 Monotherapy Expansion
Clinical safety monitoring of subjects treated with BMS-986158 monotherapy enrolled in Part 2 
of the study will be the same as conducted during the dose esca lation portion. Duri ng Part 2, if in 
a given tumor cohort the combined incidence of study drug-relat ed AEs that require dose 
modification exceeds 29% (of treated subjects), then further en rollment to that arm may be 
interrupted and the fi ndings will be discussed between the Spon sor/Medical Monitor and 
investigators. An agreement will be  reached as to whether a low er dose level  or an altern ate dose 
schedule of BMS-986158 should be examined, or whether any addit ional treatment guidelines 
should be implemented prior to enrollment of additional subject s on study in alignment with dose 
modification criteria ( Section 4.5.2 ), discontinuation criteria, and other safety evaluation criter ia.
3.1.2.2 Safety Evaluation Phase of BMS-986158 Combination with Nivolumab
If combination therapy with nivolumab is pursued, the safety of  the selected BMS-986158 dose 
when given in combination with nivolumab within the dose expansio n phase will be evaluated by 
monitoring DLTs in the first 6 to 12 subjects treated across the  different tumor cohorts receiving 
combination therapy. Once the selected dose of BMS-986158 in com bination with nivolumab is 
deemed safe based on the DLT evaluation, the dose expansion wil l continue as planned in all 
cohorts. 
The guidance for assessing the DLT-related safety and overall sa fety will be similar to that used 
in the monotherapy c ohorts. The DLT safety  monitoring during the dose evaluation phase 
including potential decision t o de-escalate to a lower dose w ill be based on the mTPI-2 design49
with target toxicity (DLT) rate of  29% (-2%, +4%), as presented in Table 3.1.2.2-1 .T h e  
performance of the design is reported in Appendix 8.
Initially, the first 3 to 4 subjects treated in combination will be evaluated for DLT. If 0 or 1 DLT 
is observed during the DLT period established fo r BMS-986158, an additional 3 subjects w ill be 
treated at the same BMS-986158 dose level. A decision to stay at  the same dose level by treating 
additional 3 to 4 subjects, to expand (continue enrollment) of a ll subjects treated with combination 
therapy across all tum or cohorts (declaring this dose to be safe), or to consider de-escal ation will 
be guided by the number of subjects with DLTs observed during t he dose evaluation phase and the 
posterior probability of D LT. (Table 3.1.2.2-1 and Table 3.1.2.2-2 ). Subjects who do not complete 
the DLT observation period for reasons other than DLTs will not  contribute to this safety 
evaluation and can be replaced. De-escalation may be considered i f the safety and tolerability

Source: Target Toxicity (DLT) Rate used is 29% (-2%, +4%). 
D = de-escalate to lower dose; DLT = dose limiting toxicity; E = e xpand at this dose in each tumor type; 
DU = de-escalate to lower dose and the current dose will never be used again in the trial; mTPI = modified Toxicity 
Probability Interval; S = stay at the same dose.
*Additional considerations including information from Table 3.1. 2.2-2 below will be used. 
In the case where 4 DLTs are observed out of 12 evaluable subjects as shown in Table 3.1.2.2-1, 
the design recommends the decision to stay at the same dose leve l (S), indicati ng that more subjects 
need to be evaluated to determine whether the dose level is saf e. After considering additional 
information such as provided in Table 3.1.2.2-2, a lower dose m ay be considered for evaluation 
based on discussion between Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investi gators. 
In addition to the above guidan ce, the follo wing posterior prob abilities may be utilized to make a 
more informed decision on the safety based on DLT findings prio r to the decision to expand. 
Assuming a 33% acceptable DLT rate in a combination therapy set ting, which corresponds to a 
Beta(1,2) distribution, Table 3.1.2.2-2 shows the risk of select ing a BMS-986158 dose level as 
safe based on the observed DLTs and expressed as a posterior pr obability of toxicity given the 
number of DLTs observed during the combination safety evaluatio n phase.

Posterior probabilities are calculated using a Beta(1,2) prior corresponding to 33% DLT rate (ie, 1 of 3 evaluable 
subjects has a DLT). 
DLT = dose limiting toxicity.
Based on the above, if 0 out of 6 , 1 out of 9 , or 2 out of 12 sub jects experience a DLT, the dose 
level may be considered sufficiently safe to open enrollment to  the additional subjects in the 
expansion phase of the study. 
3.1.2.3 Safety Evaluation in Adolescents
Adolescent subjects will be treated with a dose and schedule sel ected from Part 1 (dose escalation)
in adult subjects. The safety of this selected BMS-986158 dose will be evalu ated in adolescents 
(≥12 to <18 years of age) as part of the dose expansion phase (Pa rt 2) in subjects with NMC, BL,
ES, or other tumors wit h genetic abnormalities in BRD proteins ( Section 1.1.7 and Section 1.1.13 ). 
Initially, 3 to 4 adolescent subjects across different tumor ty pes may be enrolled in the Initial 
Expansion and monitored for DLT. Further enrollment of adolescent subjects into the Subsequent 
Expansion will depend on the totality of data, including safety , PK and PD data obtained from all 
subjects in the init ial expansion. Based on saf ety and other available d ata, the Sponsor may 
consider decreasing the dose level of BMS-986158 for adolescent  subjects. The selected dose may 
be further evaluated in adolescent subjects in combination with  nivolumab, if combination therapy 
is pursued, depending on the review of pharmacodynamics results and other d ata from B MS-
986158 monotherapy. If pursued, 3 to 4 subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age across any eligible tumor 
types (eg, NMC, BL, and ES), will be treated with  BMS-986158 in combination with nivolumab 
to establish safety of the combination treatment in this adoles cent population. S ubjects will be 
observed for DLT, and if safety is considered acceptable, addit ional adolescent subjects w ill be 
treated with combination therapy. 
3.1.2.4 BMS-986158 Monotherapy and in Combination with Nivolumab Dose

signal, and to obtain additional data, such as  safety informat ion across 
the selected tumors. 
Enrollment in the Part 2 expansio n will start in the initial BM S-986158 monotherapy cohorts. 
Although a 2-stage (Fleming) design will be used to guide assessment of preliminary anti-tumor 
activity in  each of the monotherapy c ohorts (and in combination therapy with nivolumab, if 
pursued), up to 9 subjects may be enrolled in each of the initial cohorts to b etter characterize the 
PK, safety,  and inform enrollmen t in both the subsequent 
monotherapy and potential combination expansion cohorts. The de cision to open subsequent 
cohorts (monotherapy or in combination) will take into acount t he totality of the available data and 
upon agreement of the Sponsor/Medical Monitor, in consul tation with the investigators. The 
decision to continue or discontinue enrollment in one or more cohorts or discontinue treatment in 
existing cohorts w ill be made by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor based on a comprehen sive 
assessment of the accruing on-treatment evidence (see Section 3.1.2.1 and Section 3.5 ).
Clinical safety monitoring of s ubjects during dose expa nsion phase will continue throughout the 
study. If at a selected BMS-986158 dose level, the combined inc idence exceeds 33% for study 
drug related toxicity requiring treatment discontinuation, furt her enrollment to that dose level may 
be interrupted and a d ecision to continue dosing will be based on discussions of the observed 
aggregate (acute and chronic) toxicities between the investigat or(s) and the Sponsor, if needed.

The minimum overall planned sample sizes are based on Stage 1 i nitial enrollment, subsequent enrollment, and 
combination therapy enrollment s ubject counts per cohort. The ma ximums are determined similarly. The above 
assumes that the selected dose level administered in combinatio n is deemed safe; alternately  an additiona l 6 to12 
subjects may need to be treated to assess safety at a lower dose  level and to continue enrolling all combination 
therapy cohorts. 
An additional 6 to 12 subjects may be enrolled to evaluate a lo wer dose of BMS-986158 in 
combination therapy as well as a nother 18 subjects may be enrol led to evaluate target gene 
engagement in tumors, and additional PK and safety characterist ics in up to 2 cohorts at a different
dose or schedule. Therefore, the potential total for expansion wi ll be approximately up to 201
subjects if only monotherapy is pursued, and approximately up t o 327 subjects if all planned 
expansion cohort subjects in monotherapy and combination therapy groups are pursued. 
Administration of Additional Treatment Cycles:
Subjects may discontinue treatment due to disease progression, unacceptable AEs, or at the 
subject’s request. Treatment decisions related to subject management will be based exclusively on 
RECIST version 1.1 ( Appendix 4 ), the Lugano 2014 criteria ( Appendix 9 ), or PCWG3 criteria 
(including PSA assessments) ( Appendix 12 ). Subjects with an objective response of CR, partial 
response (PR) or stable disease, will continue therapy until th ey develop progressive disease (PD, 
unless in case of treatment beyond progression as detailed in Section 3.6 ), experience clinical 
deterioration, develop AEs requiring discontinuation of treatme nt or withdraw consent. Subjects 
who developed disease progression on BMS-986158 monotherapy in Part 2 will not be allowed to 
switch to combination therapy.
Subjects who develop toxicity requiring discontinuation of trea tment w ill enter the Clinical 
Follow-up Period. The subject should be see n in follow-up at le ast every 30 days, until the AE has 
resolved to baseline, stabilized, or been deemed irreversible. After completion of the Clinical 
Follow-up Period, sub jects will then enter the Survival Follow-up Period. During thi s peri od, clin ic 
visits or telephone contact every 3-4 months will be performed t o assess survival status.

Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully conside red to ensure the safety of the study 
subjects and that the results of the study can be used. It is i mperative that subjects fully meet all 
eligibility criteria.
3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any femal e who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hyst erectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined a s 12 months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45 in the absence of other biological or physi ological causes. In addition, 
females under the age of 55 years must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Females treated with hormone repl acement therapy, (HRT) are lik ely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level i s >40 mlU/ml at any time during 
the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal.

Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
Glucocorticoids may be administered for treatment of infusion r eactions and as premedicati on to 
prevent infusion reactions.
Palliative radiation therapy to a limited field (eg, painful bo ne metastasis, painful lumps), if it is 
not the sole site of measurable and/or assessable disease, is a llowed any time during study
participation with prior approval of the Sponsor/Medical Monito r.
Subjects with prostate cancer (CRPC and NEPC) are allowed to continue ARD therapy during this 
trial if the therapeutic agent(s) is (are) not prohibited due to CY P3A4 interactions (eg, 
enzalutamide is prohibited). Other agents without strong CYP3A4  interactions, such as androgen 
synthesis inhibitors, gonadotropin realizing hormone analogs, o r AR antagonists may be continued 
if the subject is already on a stable dose.
Subjects are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic abs orption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (<3 weeks) course of co rticosteroids for prophylaxis 
(eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune co nditions (eg, delayed-type 
hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contrast allergen) is per mitted.
Any concomitant therapies within 4 weeks prior to study d rug administration and until the final 
follow-up visit must be recorded on the CRF.
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
Prohibited and/or restricted medications taken pri or to study d rug administration in the study are 
described in Section 3.3.2 . Medications taken within 4 weeks prior to study d rug administration 
and until the end of the Clinical Follow-up Period must be recorded on the case report form (CRF).
The following medications are prohibited during the study (unle ss utilized to treat a drug-related

of hematopoietic  growth factors is at the discretion of the treating physician, as per institutional 
guidelines. Subjects with neutropenic fever or inf ection s hould be treated promptly and may 
receive therapeutic colony-stimulating factors if appropriate.
•Immunosuppressive agents
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 3.3.2 )
•Live virus vaccine during the study and for a period of three mo nths after the last dose of st udy 
treatment.
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Subjects may take the study drug with or without food, however it must be documented whether 
the drug was taken with or without (no food approximately1 hour prior and 2 hours after dose)
food. 
•Grapefruit and Seville oranges and their juices can inhibit CYP 3A4 and should not be 
consumed while on study.
•Because of the potential for reproductive adverse effects, opti ons for sperm and egg banking 
should be discussed with the subject, if appropriate.
•Subjects should be provided loperamide or lomotil at the first  dosing visit, instructed on its use 
and counseled to contact their clinician at the first occurrence of diarrhea or loose stools.
Anti-Emetic and Anti-Diarrheal Medications
Supportive care may include premedication with anti-emetics to limit treatment-related nausea and 
vomiting. Subjects should receive medications for treatment-ind uced diarrhea, as outlined in 
Section 4.5.3 .
Other Concomitant MedicationsAnti-inflammatory or narcotic analgesics may be offered as neede d. Packed RBC and platelet 
transfusions should be administered as clinically indicated.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug
Subjects MUST discontinue BMS-986158 if receiving monotherapy an d both BMS-986158 and 
nivolumab if receiving combinatio n therapy (and non-IP at the dis cretion of the investigator) for 
any of the following reasons:
•Subject’s request to stop study treatment and/or participation in the study
•Any clinical AE, laboratory a bnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the 
investigator, indicates that continued participation in the stu dy is not in the best interest of the 
subject
•Termination of the study by BMS
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily inca rceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectio us disease) illness
•Inability to comply with protocol

•Discretion of the investigator
•AEs requiring discontinuation as outlined in the Dose Modificat ion section (See Section 4.5.2 )
•Pregnancy
•Documented and confirmed PD as defined by RECIST v1.1 (for soli d tumors, see Appendix 
04), or Lugano 2014 (for hematoligic tumors see Appendix 09 ), or PCWG3 (for CRPC and 
NEPC see Appendix 12 ) unless participant meets cr iteria for treatmen t beyond progression 
(Section 3.6)
All subjects who discont inue investigational product (IP) s hould comply with protocol sp ecified 
follow-up procedures as outlined in Section 5 . The only exception to this requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study procedures including po st-treatment study follow-up or 
loses the ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involu ntarily incarcerated for the treatment 
of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion  of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.3.6 Treatment Beyond Progression
Evidence supporting the continuation of BMS-986158 monotherapy in subjects with solid or 
hematologic malignancies beyond progression of their disease is  lacking and therefore 
monotherapy treatment beyo nd progression will not be allowed. If combination therapy is p ursued, 
subjects receiving BMS-986158 in combination with nivolumab wil l be permitted to continue on 
combination therapy beyond initial RECIST v1.1, Lugano 2014 (Ap pendix 9), or PCWG 
(Appendix 12) defined PD, as long as they meet the following criteria:
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and not having rapid dis ease progression
•Continue to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria
•Tolerance of study drug
•Stable performance status
•Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
•Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving an y BMS-986158 plus nivolumab
treatment using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable ri sks, discomforts, or other 
alternative treatment options
The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whe ther the subject is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from cont inued treatment. All d ecisions to 
continue treatment beyond init ial progression must be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor 
and an assessment of the benefit/risk of continuing with study drug must be documented in the 
study records. Subjects will be re -consented to explain the rat ionale for this ongoing treatment.

3.7 Post Study Drug Follow-up
In this study, safety is a key endpoint of the study. Post stud y follow-up is of critical importance 
and is essential to preserving subject safety a nd the integrity of the study. Sub jects who discontinue 
study drug must continue to be  followed for collection of outco me and/or survival follow-up data 
as required and in line with Section 5 until death or the conclusion of the study.
3.7.1 Withdrawal of ConsentSubjects who request to discontinue study drug w ill remain in the study and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him /her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this information. Subjects sho uld notify the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medi cal records by the investigator, as 
to whether the withdra wal is from further tr eatment with study drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered o n the appropriate CRF page. In the 
event that vital status (whether the subject i s alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available 
information should be used to determine vital status only as ap propriately directed in accordance 
with local law.
3.7.2 Lost to Follow-Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to deter mine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up with  persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow-up 
is defined by the inability t o reach the subject after a minimu m of three documented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of respons e by subject t o one registered ma il letter. A ll attempts 
should be  documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is  determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist i n the follow- up portion of  the study has 
been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the inves tigator may use a Sponsor-retained 
third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact  information or other
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up po rtion of the study. The site staff and 
representative will consult publicly available sources, such as  public health registries and 
databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If a fter all attempts, the subject remains 
lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator s hould be 
reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.4 STUDY DRUG

4.1 Investigational Product
An IP, also known as investig ational medicinal product in some regions, is defined as a 
pharmaceut ical form of an  active substance or placebo being tes ted or used as a reference in a 
clinical study, including products already with a marketing aut horization but used or assembled 
(formulated or pack aged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized 
indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure that IP is only dispensed to study su bjects. The IP must be dispensed 
only from official study sites by authorized personnel accordin g to local regulations. 
In this protocol the IP are BMS-986158 and nivolumab. BMS-986158 in  combination with 
nivolumab will only be pursue d on review of safety  information and the totality of data obtained 
from BMS-986158 monotherapy in Parts 1 and 2.
Nivolumab (Part 2)
Nivolumab infusions s hould start approx imately 30 minutes following BMS-986158
administration. Niv olumab should be i nfused over 30 minutes in adults and adolescents. Further 
details regarding preparation and administration will be provided separately in site pharmacy 
training materials. 
Guidelines for Nivolumab-related Infusion Reactions
For Grade 1 symptoms: (Mild reaction; i nfusion interruption not i ndicated; intervention not 
indicated)
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympt oms. The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydr amine 50 mg (or equiv alent) 
and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 min utes before additional 
nivolumab administrations.For Grade 2 symptoms: (Moderate reaction requires therapy or i nfusion interruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours):
•Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal sal ine, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/pa racetamol 325 to 1000

mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of s ymptoms. Corticosteroid and/or 
bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, 
then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when symptoms resolve; if no 
further complications ensure after 30 minutes, the rate ma y be increased to 100% of the original 
infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab will be 
administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 
1,000 mg should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivol umab infusio ns. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 m g of hydrocortisone or equiv alent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medicat ion and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicat ed for other clinical sequelae [eg, 
renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: life-threate ning; pressor or ventilator support 
indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infu sion of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1000 
solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution injected 
slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV w ith methylprednisolone 
100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitore d until the investigator is 
comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be  permanently discontinued.
Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympt oms.
In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, ap pearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomati c treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
4.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medicati on for preventative,  diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the SOC for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non-IPs.
4.3 Storage and DispensingThe product storage manager should ensure that the study drugs a re stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the quality or appearan ce of the study drugs arise, th e study drugs should not be 
dispensed and BMS s hould be contacted  immediately.
Study drug not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance wit h the package insert.
IP documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be mainta ined that includes all processes 
required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includ es documentation of drug storage,

administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, recons titution, and use of required 
processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).
4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
This is an open-label study. Enrolled subjects, including those  not dosed, will be assigned 
sequential subject numbers starting with 00001, eg, 00001, 0000 2, 00003.... 00010. Those enrolled 
subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be eligible to be do sed. Sequential numbering may restart 
at 00001 for each participating site as the distinct subject id entification number (PID) will 
ultimately be comprised of the site number and subject number, eg, 0002 00001. 
During Part 1, once informed consen t has been ob tained, the inv estigator (or designee) will register 
the subject by transmitting a copy of the completed enrollment worksheet (registration form) to 
the Sponsor.
The following information is required for registration:
•Subject’s date of birth (month and year only are acceptable if required by local regulation)
•Gender
•Diagnosis
•Statement that subject is eligible
•Date of informed consent
•Planned date of first dose
Treatment groups and/or dose levels will be provided to the sit e study team after the subject has 
registered and eligibility for the study confirmed. Site person nel/investigator will receive a receipt 
confirming treatment assignment.  A copy of this documentation s hould remain in the subject’s 
chart.
In the dose escalation phase, if a subject discontinues treatme nt with BMS- 986158 during t he DLT 
Evaluation period for r easons other than DLT, the subject may be  replaced if necessary for safety 
assessments. Replacement sub jects will r eceive the same treatment but w ill be assigned a new 
subject number. Subjects may be permitted to rescreen for the study following a greement between the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators. In Part 2, during the screening visit, the investigative site will call into the enrollment option of 
the interactive response technology (IRT) designated by BMS. Enro lled participants, including 
those not dosed, will be assigned sequential participant number s for their site starting with 00001, 
(eg, 00001, 00002, 00003.... 00010). The pa tient identification  number (PID) will ulti mately be 
comprised of the site number and participant number. Once it is  determined that the participant 
meets the eligibility criteria following the screening visit, the investigative site will call the IRT to 
centrally assign the participant into the appropriate monothera py or combination therapy cohort. 
If both monotherapy and combinat ion cohorts are open for a tumor  type, the assignment of subjects 
will alternate between the 2 regimens.

4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
In each dose escalation part (Part 1) of the study, subjects will  be assigned to a specific dose level 
(see Section 3.1.1 ). Subjects in the expansion cohorts (Part 2) will be enrolled a t or below the MTD 
or alternative dose as agreed upon by the Sponsor/Medical Monito r and investigators 
(Section 3.1.2 ).
4.5.1 Dose Limiting ToxicitiesFor the purpose of guiding dose escalation, DLTs will be define d based on incidence, intensity, 
and durati on of AEs for which no clear alternative cause is identified. T he DLT evaluation period 
for dose escalation in Part 1 Schedule A is 32 to 35 days (dependin g on the exact day of the start 
of Cycle 2); for Schedules B and C it is 35 days. For Part 1 Schedu le A, subjects must receive at 
least 16 of 21 doses of BMS-986158; for Schedule B at least 17 of  the 22 doses; and for Schedule C 
at least 12 of 15 doses to be considered DLT evaluable for dose es calation decisions. The DLT 
period for safety assessment  of BMS-986158 and, if pursued, nivolumab combination therapy in  
Part 2 will be 28 days for all schedules which excludes a 7-day period for a single dose as in Cycle 
1 in Part 1, to allow s imilar drug exposure and appropri ate comparison of the safety profile between 
Part 1 and Part 2. For Part 2 safety assessment of the combinat ion therapy (if pursued), subjects 
must receive at least  15 of 20 doses on Schedule A. If altern ate schedules are explored, subjects 
must receive 16 of 21 doses on Schedule B, and 11 of 14 doses on Schedule C. AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. For the purpose of subject ma nagement, any AE that meets 
DLT criteria, regardless of the c ycle in which it occurs, will lead to dose interruption. Subjects 
who withdraw from the study during the DLT evaluation interval for reasons other than a DLT 
may be replaced at the same dose level. The incidence of DLT(s) during the first cycles of treatment (the DLT evaluation period) will be used in dose esca lation decisions and t o define the 
MTD. AEs occurring after the DLT period will be considered for the purposes of defining the 
recommended Phase 2 dose, upon a greement between the Sponsor/ M edical Monitor and 
investigators, if the AEs are determined to have no clear alter native cause and are not related to 
disease progression. 
DLT(s) will be defined as any of the following events unless a clear alternative cause is identified:
Non-Hematologic DLT:
Any of the following events will be considered a Non-Hematologi c DLT:
•≥Grade 3 Non-Hematologic toxicity, with the following exceptions.
♦≥ Grade 3 electrolyte a bnormalities that are not complicated by associated clinical AEs, 
are not clinically significant, last < 72 hours and either resol ve spontaneously or respond 
to conventional medical intervention
♦≥ Grade 3 elevations in serum transaminases (AST, ALT), total bil irubin, alkaline 
phosphatase that last < 5 days and are not associated with clini cal symptoms.
♦Isolated Grade 3 elevation of amylase or lipase not associated with clinical or radiographic 
evidence of pancreatitis

4.5.2 Guidelines for Dose Modifications
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study therapy. Subjects will be 
instructed to notify their physician immediately for any and all AEs. The criteria presented in this 
section and Table 4.5.2-1 for dose modifications and dela ys for BMS-986158 are meant as general 
guidelines.
•Subjects will continue to receive therapy as long as they have not had disease progression or 
an AE requiring dose modification, as described below.
•Dose modifications, interruptions, or delays may occur in the se tting of lower grade AEs and/or 
be more conservative than indi cated in Table 4.5.2-1 based on th e clinical judgment of the 
investigator, and in consultation with the Sponsor/Medical Moni tor.
•For BMS-986158, dose reductions should be to the previous lower  dose level, or to a dose 
level in between the previous dose level and the current dose l evel, after discussion between 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor. A decision to remain at the current dose level requires a discussion 
and an agreement between the investigator and the Sponsor/Medic al Monitor. 
•If several AEs of varying grade or severity occur simultaneousl y, the dose modi fication applied 
should be the greatest reduction applicable based on the worse g rade (or severity) observed 
among the AEs reported.
•Assessment of causality (c hronology, c onfounding factors such as disease, concomitant 
medications, diagnostic tests and previous experience with the agent) must be determined and 
documented by the investigator, prior to dose modification.
•If the same Grade 3 non-hematologic AE recurs despite a dose red uction, a second dose 
reduction versus discontinuation of the subject from further pr otocol therapy will be discussed 
and agreed upon by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investigator s.
•Subjects who experience a Grade 4 non-hematologic AE w ill not r eceive additional protocol-
related therapy and will be removed from study unless discussed and agreed upon by the

Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators that it is in the bes t interest of the subject to  receive 
additional therapy with BMS-986158 (for example, if the subject  has demonstrated a response 
to therapy).
•No more than 2 dose level reductions of BMS-986158 w ill be allowed per sub ject. If a third 
dose reduction is required, the subject must discontinue BMS-986 158 (and nivolumab, if 
receiving combination therapy based on response to therapy). Dose re-escalation after a dose 
reduction may occur in limited circumstances (such as a change in attribution of an AE, or if 
re-escalation is in the best interest of the subject) after dis cussion and agreement of the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators. The number of dose mo difications needed for a 
subject should be discussed and agreed between the investigator  and the Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor.
•Skipped doses will not be administered within the same cycle.
•For an AE requiring dose modi fication, BM S-986158 (and nivolumab  for subjects receiving 
combination therapy) should be interrupted to allow recovery fr om  the AE. Re-initiati on of 
study drug cannot occur un til AE decreases to ≤Grade 1 or baseline assessment. In case of 
delayed recovery to ≤Grade 1 or baseline (except fo r alopecia) fro m treatment-relate d AEs 
that results in a delay of treatment for > 30 days, the subject  will not r eceive additional 
protocol-related therapy and will be removed from study unless d iscussed and agreed upon by 
the Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators that it is in the  best interest of the subject to 
receive additional therapy with BMS-986158 (for example, if the  subject has demonstrated a 
response to therapy).
•For patients receiving combination therapy, if 1 study drug mus t be discontinued, the other 
study drug may be continued as single agent therapy based on di scussion with Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor and the investigator.
•For subjects in Part 2 monotherapy expansion or (if pursued) co mbination expansion who 
report an AE requiring dose modification, the dose of BMS-986158  should be reduced from 
3.75 mg to 3 mg. See Table 4.5.2-1 .
For data collection and analysis purposes, all subjects will co ntinue to be classified by the original 
treatment arm.

the overall tolerability of study tr eatment. This schedule change may be in lieu of dose 
modification shown in Table 4.5.2-1. At the agreement of the in vestigator and Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor, subjects who have alr eady had dose reduction may be restarted at the original dose under 
the revised schedule. For data collection and analysis purposes, all subjects will continue to be 
classified by the original treatment arm.
Reasons for dose modifications or delays, the supportive measures taken and the outcome must be 
documented in the subject’s chart and recorded in the CRF.
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study therapy. Subjects will be 
instructed to notify their physician immediately for any and al l toxicity. The criteria presented in

4.5.3 Management of Diarrhea for BMS-986158
For symptoms of diarrhea th at occur at any time during treatmen t with BMS-986158, dose 
interruption is recommended un til dia rrhea resolves. After recovery, dose reduction or 
discontinuation should follow the criteria in Section 4.5.2 depending on the severity of the 
diarrhea. The following are guidelines for the management of di arrhea and are not intended to 
replace the clinical judgment of the treating physician(s):
For Grade 3 or higher events of diarrhea that are not controlled (ie, to Grade 1 or bas eline) with 
loperamide or lomotil, dosing of BMS-986158 should be interrupte d, as continued dosing will 
likely result in increased severity of diarrhea. In addition, ev aluation of infectious causes should 
be considered. After recovery, dose redu ction or discontinuation should follow the cr iteria in the 
protocol, depending on the severity of the diarrhea. The follow ing are guidelines for the 
management of diarrhea,  and should be used along with the clini cal judgment of the treating 
physician(s). 
•Diet: Reco mmendations should include eating small, frequent meals, diet modification 
(avoiding milk products, spicy and/or f atty foods, alcohol, and caffeine), and  aggressive oral 
hydration.
•Treatment with Loperamide: Loperamide should be started at the earliest si gn of (1) a poorly 
formed or loose stool, (2) the occurrence of 1 to 2 more bowel movements than usual in 1 day, 
or (3) an increase in stool volume or liquidity. Loperamide may  be taken in the following 
manner: 4 mg at the first onset of diarrhea, then 2 mg every 2 hours around the clock until 
diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Subjects may take loperami de 4 mg every 4 hours during 
the night. This dose regimen is higher than the standard dose of  loperamide but is typical for 
the treatment of diarrhea caused by anticancer therapy. Subject s should be provided with 
loperamide and instructed in its use at the initial treatment visit so that they have sufficient 
supply on hand in case antidiarrh eal support is required. It is  important that loperamide is taken 
as instructed. For subjects who cannot tolerate loperamide or wh o do not get adequate relief 
with maximum doses, standar d doses of Lomo til® (dip henoxylate/a tropine) may be added or 
used instead of loperamide. 
•Additional antidiarrheal measures, such as octreotide, may be u sed at the discretion of the 
investigator or treating physician.
•Increase Fluid Intake and, if a pplicable, consider stopping ant i-hypertensive therapy and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Hypotension and/o r renal insufficiency can 
occur in the setting of volume de pletion from sev ere diarrhea. At the onset of any diarrhea, 
subjects should be instructed to increase fluid intake to help maintain fluid and electrolyte 
balance during episodes of diarrhea. Parenteral hydration should be started if oral hydration is 
not sufficient. The investigator should consider interrupting a nti-hypertensive therapy and 
NSAIDs, if medically appropriate.
4.5.4 Management Algorithms for Immuno-oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration from 
AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is considere d an immuno-oncology agent in 
this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associat ed with immuno-oncology agents

BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
may mitigate severe toxicity. Ma nagement algorithms have been d eveloped form extensive 
experience with nivolumab and ipilimumab to assist investigator s in assessing and managing the 
following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Skin
•Neurological
The clinical nature of AEs noted with nivolumab (in combination  with BMS-986158) will 
determine the role of the above al gorithms  for use in toxicities related to its use in this study. The 
algorithms reco mmended for utilization in this protocol are included in Appendix 10 .
In addition, nivolumab therapy can be associated with visual co mplaints. Inflammation of 
components within the eye is an uncommon, but clinically import ant, event. An ophthalmologist 
should evaluate visual complaints with examination of the conju nctiva, anterior and posterior 
chambers, and retina. Topical c orticosteroids may be used to manage low-grade events. Low-grade
events that do not resolve and high-grade events should be mana ged with systemic corticosteroids. 
Consultation with a BMS Medical Monit or should be sought for all cases of ocular inf lammatory 
events. Complaints of double vision should also prompt medical evaluation.
Cases of rare events, some wit h fatal outcome, have been report ed with nivolumab (see the 
Investigator Brochure for Nivolumab for details). If a participant develops signs and symptoms of 
myositis, myocarditis or rhabdomyolysis or other rare event, th e case should be discussed with 
BMS Medical Monitor, close monitoring s hould be imp lemented, and the patient referred to a 
specialist for assessment and treatment without delay. Based on  the severity of the event, 
nivolumab should be withheld or discontinued, and appropriate t reatment instituted. For Grade 3 
myocarditis, nivolumab should be permanently discontinued.
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
This study is a non-randomized open-label study for Part 1 and Part 2. Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT) will be used in Part 2 for tr eatment assignmen t. Data emerging from this 
exploratory study may be necessary to inform timely d ecisions for adjusting procedures in 
subsequent portions of the study, including early termination o f the study. Additionally, 
availability of the  open label tr eatment assignments ma y facilitate optimization of the bioanalytical 
analysis of samples.
4.7 Treatment Compliance

administered on an outpatient basis. The investigator and the st udy personnel will ensure that each 
subject receives the calculated dose of the study drug. Treatme nt compliance will be monitored by 
drug accountability, as well as r ecording BMS-986158 administrat ion in subjects’ medical records 
and CRF. Subjects must keep a diary of study medication doses a nd any missed doses (see 
Section 4 ). Subjects s hould bring all drug containers to each study visit for drug reconciliation . 
Drug supplies will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. The Drug 
Accountability Log will be review ed by the study monitor during site visits and at the completion 
of the study. Any discrepancy should be brought to the attentio n of the Sponsor.
4.8 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study, study drugs (those supplied by BMS or sourced b y the investigator) such as partially 
used study drug containers, vials and syringes may be destroyed  on site. 
Any unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspec ted and reconciled by the 
responsible BMS Study Monit or unless study d rug containers must be immediately destroyed as 
required for safety,  or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxi cs or biologics). 
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal s tandards are met:
•On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from  the drug.
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agr eement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
•Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and follo wed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy  provided t o BMS upon requ est.
•Records are maintain ed that allow for traceability of each cont ainer, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identif ication of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor 
must be documented.
•Accountability and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, a nd available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.
If conditions for destruction ca nnot be met, the r esponsible BMS  Study Monitor will make 
arrangements for return of study drug.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal  of all empty containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are 
kept. 4.9 Return of Study Drug
If study drug w ill not be destroye d upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/o r 
partially used st udy drug that was supplied by BMS must be retu rned to BMS. The return of study 
drug will be arranged by the responsible Study Monitor. 
Arrangements for the return of study drug will be made by the r esponsible Study Monitor.

5.1.1 Retesting During Screening
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments dur ing the Screening or Lead-in 
period will be permitted (in addition to any parameters that req uire a confirmatory result).
Any new result will override the previous result (ie, the most current result prior t o treatment) and 
is the value by which study inclusion will be assessed, as it re presents the subject’s most current, 
clinical state.
5.2 Study Materials
The site will provide all require d materials for the tests pe rformed locally (ie, relevant clinical 
laboratory tests and urine drug screens). The site will have av ailable a well-calibrated scale for 
recording body weight, a 12- lead ECG machine, and a calibrated s phygmomanometer and 
thermometer for vital signs assessments. A current and fully-st ocked [advanced cardiac life 
support (ACLS) or basic cardiac life support (BCLS) cart w ill be immed iately available on the 
premises. The site will have urine collecti on containers, a refrigerated  centrifuge, a monitored and 
alarmed refrigerator, and freezer (-20°C or below), as well as containers and dry ice for shipment 
and storage of blood and urine samples. The site will provide all materials required for accurate 
source documentation of study activities and for housing the su bjects during the study. 
BMS will provide a BMS-approved protocol and any amendments or administrative letters (if 
required), and IB. CRFs (electronic or hard copy) w ill be provided by BMS. The Central 
Laboratory will provide labels and tubes for the collection of blood samples for PK  
. Enrollment regi stration worksheets will be provided to the study sites. Sites will 
fax/e-mail e nrollment worksheets to BMS at the time of informed consent. NC I CTCAE criteria 
will be provided to st udy sites prior to site initiation. BMS will also provide subject diaries to 
collect oral dosing, missed dosing information including a description of the reason for the missed dose, PID number, date and time of dosing, number of stools, doses of loperamide, etc w ill also 
be captured in the diary. The subject must record any incidence  of vomiting 2 hours post ingestion 
of BMS-986158 dose. Sites may use their own IRB approved subject diaries as long as it captures all the information required by the protocol. Subject diaries sh ould be kept on-site and should only 
be provided to BMS upon request. The subjects must bring their diaries to every office visit (or at least once a month) so that it can be reviewed by the site staf f. Additional instructions will be 
provided along with the subject diary.
5.3 Safety Assessments
All subjects who receive at least one dose of BM S-986158 will be  evaluated for safety parameters. 
Additionally, any occurrence of an SAE  from the time of conse nt until 30 days post discontinuation 
of BMS-986158 monotherapy and 100 days post discontinuation of c ombination therapy will be 
documented. Any occurrence of non -serious AEs will be collected  from first dose of study drug 
until 30 days post discontinuation of BMS- 986158 monotherapy a nd 100 days post discontinuation 
of combination therapy. AEs will be coded using the most current  version of MedDRA. Safety 
will be evaluated for all treated subjects using the NCI CTCAE v4.03. Safety assessments will be 
based on medical review of AE reports and the results of vital sign measurements (body 
temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure ( heart rate and blood pressure should

be measured after subject has been resting quietly for at least  5 minutes), physical examinations 
and clinical laboratory tests. Subjects should be followed unti l all AEs for which no clear 
alternative cause is identified other than to BMS-986158 have r ecovered to baseline or are deemed 
irreversible by the investigator. The incidence of AEs w ill be tabu lated and reviewed for potential 
significance and clinical importance. 
The schedule of required visits, tests, procedures and assessme nts are described Table 5.1-1 , Table 
5.1-2 Table 5.1-3 , Table 5.1-4 , Table 5.1-5 , and Table 5.1-6 .
In limited instan ces, scheduled events (including events other than safety assessments) can occur 
outside of the indicated timeframes but the Sponsor should firs t be notified.
If a subject has a delay in study drug administration for any r eason, then assessments and 
laboratory tests (with the exception of any tests needed to ens ure subject safety) should be 
correspondingly delayed with the  exception of tumor assessments (continue scans every 8-9 weeks 
± 7 days regardless of dosing delays). At baseline, a med ical history will be ob tained to capture 
relevant underlying conditions. Baseline signs and symptoms are  those that are assessed within 
2 weeks prior to subject enrollment. The baseline physical exami nation should include weight, 
height, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperatu re, and ECOG status and should be 
performed withi n 28 days of tr eatment arm assignment (see Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2. Table 5.1- 3, 
Table 5.1-4, Table 5.1-5, and Table 5.1-6). If any vital sign is  abnormal, the subject must be 
observed further for a peri od of time, as clinically i ndicated.  Any new or worsening clinically 
significant changes must be reported on the appropriate non-ser ious or serious AE page.
Additional measures including non-study required laboratory tes ts should be performed as 
clinically indicated.Only data for the procedures and assessments specified in this protocol (see Table 5.1-1, Table 
5.1-2. Table 5.1-3, Table 5.1-4, Table 5.1-5, and Table 5.1-6) s hould be s ubmitted to BMS. 
Additional procedures and assessments may be performed as part of SOC; however, data for these 
assessments  should remain in the subject’s med ical rec ord and should not b e provided to BMS 
unless specifically requested by BMS.
Clinical laboratories will be assessed (see Table 5.1-1, Table 5. 1-2. Table 5.1-3, Table 5.1-4, Table 
5.1-5, and Table 5.1-6.). Sites  should co llect samples between - 28 to -1 days from e nrollment in 
Part 1 and -40 to -1 days in Part 2 to insure that results requ ired for eligibility purposes are verified 
prior to registration. Pregnancy testing must be performed with in 24 hours prior to the initial 
administration of IP at baseline and then prior to administratio n of either study medication during 
study therapy and at the clin ical follow-up vi sit. CBC pl us differential and serum chemistry panel 
should be drawn within 24 hours prior to each subsequent schedu led cycle. Fasting (no food or 
drink for at least 8 hours) glucose samples are to be taken pred ose on C1D1 and C3D1 for 
Schedules A, B and C of Part 1 and Part 2. On-study laboratory tes ts will be pe rformed on 
si
te/locally. Laboratory tests may be obtained more frequently if indi cated. Additional laboratory 
tests should be performed as per SOC.

are deemed irreversible.
In case of dose interruption for any reason, assessments and laboratory tests (with the exception of 
any tests needed to ensure subject safety) should be correspond ingly delayed with the exception 
of tumor assessments (ie, continue scans every 8-9 weeks ± 7 days  regardless of dosing delays).
5.3.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that ar e not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by t he Study Investigator as per 
standard medical/clinical judgment.
Images will be submitted to a central imaging vendor and may un dergo blinded independent 
central review (BICR) at any time during the study. Prior to sc anning first participant, sites should 
be qualified and understand the image acquisition guidelines and submission process as outlined 
in the CA011-001 Imag ing Manual provided by the central imaging  vendor.
Every attempt sh ould be made to image each subject using an identical acquisition protocol on the 
same scanner for all imaging time points.
CT/MRI
Contrast-enhanced CT scans acquired on dedicated CT equipment i s preferred for this study. CT 
with contrast of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and all other known  and/or suspected sites of disease 
or FDG-PET (for hematologic malignancies) are to be performed fo r tumor assessments as 
indicated in Table 5.1-1 , through Table 5.1-6 . CT scans should be acquired with ≤5mm slices with 
no intervening gap (contiguous). 
If a participant has a contraindication for both MR and CT intr avenous contrasts, then a 
n o n - c o n t r a s t  C T  o f  t h e  c h e s t  a n d  a  n o n - c o n t r a s t  M R I  o f  t h e  a b d o men, pelvis, and other 
known/suspected sites of disease should be obtained. 
If a participant has a contraindication for MRI (eg, incompatib le pacemaker) in addition to 
contraindication to CT intravenous contrast, then a non-contras t CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, 
and other known/suspected sites of disease is acceptable.If a participant has a contraindication for CT IV contrast, a no n-contrast CT of the chest and a 
contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other known an d/or suspected sites of disease 
may be obtained. MRI’s  should be ac quired with slice thickness of ≤5 mm with no gap 
(contiguous).If a patient has only 1 measurable lesion, which will be subjected to a core needle biopsy, the CT 
scan should be conducted after the biopsy to establish a baseli ne.
Use of CT component of a PET-CT scanner: Combined modality scanning such as with PET 
CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modality/tec hnology that is in rapid evolution; 
therefore, the recommendations outlined here may change rather q uickly with time. At present, 
low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined PET -CT are of limited use in

anatomically-based efficacy assessments and it is therefore sug gested that they should not be 
substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically-based lesion 
measurements. However, if a site can document that the CT perfo rmed as part of a PET-CT is of 
identical dia gnostic quality to a dia gnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of 
the PET-CT can be used for target lesion measurements. Note, however, that the PET portion of 
the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigato r if it is not routinely or serially 
performed.
Participants with prostate cancer (CRPC or NEPC) should have bo ne lesions assessed using 
technetium-99m radionuclide bone  scans at each imaging assessme nt. Anterior and posterior 
whole body planar images s hould be acquired. Additional (including spot views and SPECT) 
images should be submitted if acquired. For other participants,  bone scans may be obtained if 
clinically indicated.
For participants with TNBC who do not have measurable lesions o utside the breasts, contrast 
enhanced MRI of the breasts s hould also be performed as ou tlined in Section 5.1 (Flow Chart/Time 
and Events Schedule).

5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
Disease assessment with CT and/or MRI (solid tumors and lymphom as), or FDG-PET 
(hematologic malignancies, when SOC), or as appropriate, will b e performed at baseline. Disease 
assessment will occur every 8-9 weeks ±7 days from the d ate of first dose. Disease assessment at 
other time points may be performed if the investigator is conce rned about tumor progression. 
Tumor assessments will continue until there is disease progression (unless treatment beyond 
progression in which case imaging should continue  as per schedu le), or until subjects withdraw 
from the study. Responses will be based on RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 4 ) for solid tumors. For 
hematologic malignancies, responses will be based on the Lugano  2014 Classification for Initial 
Evaluation, Staging, and Response for Hodgkin Lymphoma ( Appendix 9 ). For prostate cancer 
(NEPC and CRPC), responses will be based on PCWG3 (including PS A assessments; Appendix
12). At the sponsor’s discretion, scans and measurements may be r eviewed by independent 
radiologists using RECIST v1.1, Lugano 2014, or PCWG3 criteria at a later date, or at any time

Tumor Biopsy Collection Details
A minimum of 1 FFPE tumor tissue block (preferred) OR a minimum  of 3-4 core biopsies are 
required for biomarker evaluations in adult subjects. Specimens should contain a minimum of 100 
evaluable tumor cells. 
Complete instructions on tissue collection, processing, handlin g, and shipment of all biopsy 
samples will be provided in a sep arate procedure manual. Collection procedures at baseline and 
during treatment should be completed on a single, appropriately -assessable lesion when possible. 
Immediate confirmation for prese nce of viable tu mor cells from collected tissue samples is 
strongly recommended. If core needle biopsies are collected, 3 cores plus one additional core is 
required at screening in cases where prospective testing is req uired by  
(16 gauge is preferred if feasible), and 3 cores should be colle cted during treatment and at the EOT 
in subjects with PD. All cores will be formalin fixed for FFPE b lock preparation, 1 will be for 
 testing (at screening only, and subjects with NMC, ES, BL, and DHL 
are exempted  
 
If adequate tissue is not 
obtained following initial passages of the needle, repeat passages may be completed. The investigator, in consultation with the radiology staff, mus t determine the degree of risk 
associated with the biopsy procedure and find it acceptable. Bi opsies may be done with local 
anesthesia or conscious sedation. Institutional guidelines for t he safe performance of biopsies 
should be followed. Excisional biopsies may be performed to obt ain tumor biopsy samples. 
Invasive procedures that require general anesthesia should not be performed to obtain a biopsy

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical 
condition in a clinical investigation subject administered stud y drug and that does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this tr eatment. An AE can therefore be any unfa vorable and 
unintended sign (such as an a bnormal laboratory  finding), sympt om, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physic ian and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and 
the AE.Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is eviden ce to suggest a causal relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. Care should be taken n ot to introduce bias when collecting 
AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement in the context 
of known adverse events, when appropriate for the program or protocol.
BMS will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees according to the local 
applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA  Code of Federal Regulations 
21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it were 
more severe)

Date: 18-Mar-2019 153
Approved 10.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA011001
BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
•requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the  definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; bl ood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is  also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE.
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug i nduced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be h andled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if death o ccurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis mus t be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for repor ting details.
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations  are NOT considered SAEs in BMS cl inical studies: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical /surgical proce dure
−routine h ealth assessment requi ring admission for baseline/trending of h ealth status (eg, 
routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth a nd planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical in tervention (eg, lack of hous ing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason) .
−Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repr esent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the s tudy, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thoug ht to be associated with protocol-
specified procedures. All SAEs m ust be collected t hat occur dur ing the screening period and within 
30 days of discontinuation of dosing for subjects receiving BMS- 986158 monotherapy  and within 
100 days of discontinuation for subjects receiving BMS-986158 in combination with nivolumab.
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exi sts regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to stud y drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrati ve section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The pr eferred method for SAE data 
reporting collection is th rough the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only 
intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functi oning. In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (f ax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC ), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used a nd submitted immediately, only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
Information list.
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up r eports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initia lly reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if n ew information 
becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within  24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the in itial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.

6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug until the time 
points specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 5). Nonserious AE information should also 
be collected from the start of the screening period or other obs ervational period intended to 
establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuati on of study drug and for those pres ent at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All identified nonseri ous AEs must be recorded and  described on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or  laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subjec t to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subjec t to receive specific corrective 
therapy.
It is expected that wherever appropriate, the clinical rather t han laboratory term would be used by 
the reporting investigator (eg, thrombocytopenia versus decreas ed platelet count, an emia versus 
low hemoglobin value, etc.).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have b een pregnant at the time of st udy exposure, including during at 
least 5 half-lives after product administration, the investigat or must immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours and in accordance with SAE repor ting procedures described in 
Section 6.1.1.
In all cases, the study drug w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropri ate manner (eg, dose 
tapering if necessary for subject safety). Please call the BMS M edical Monitor withi n 24 hours of 
awareness of the pregnancy.
Protocol-required procedures fo r study disconti nuation and foll ow-up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studies) . Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.

Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional adminis tration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdose,  as a verbatim term (as reported 
by the investigat or), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intenti onal overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses shou ld be reported regardless of 
sequelae and should specify "intentional overdose" as the verba tim term. See Section 6.1.1 for 
reporting details.
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, t imely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occ urrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of chol estasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND 
No other immediately apparent po ssible causes of AT elevation a nd hyperbilirubinemia, including, 
but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or ac ute liver disease, or the administration 
of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
Dose Escalation (Part 1) : 
In the dose escalation part of the study for monotherapy Part 1, th e sample size per dose level 
cannot be precisely determined but depends on the observed DLT and the decision  rule of mTPI. 
Between 3 and up to 13 DLT evalu able subjects may be enrolled t o a given dose level, based on 
the decision gui de by the mTPI design. Treating additional subjec ts beyond the 13 at a dose level 
would be unlikely to alter the decision specified by the mTPI a lgorithm. A total of approximately 
30 subjects is expected to be treated per schedule, with a tota l of 90 planned across schedules for 
the dose escalation phase. More subjects may be added at a spec ific schedule if additional dose 
levels need to be evaluated. Similarly, fewer than 30 subjects may be needed for a different 
schedule if a smaller number of dose levels are evaluated. 
Assuming a 27% acceptable DLT rate, which corresponds to a Beta (1,2.7) distribution, the 
following table shows the risk associated with selecting a dose  level as safe given the number of 
DLTs observed at that dose level based on the posterior probabi lity associated with an observed 
DLT.

Cohort Expansion (Part 2):
Initial Monotherapy Expansion:
During this part of the study, the efficacy signal assessment w ill start with ini tial monotherapy 
cohorts. This assessment will be guided by a Fleming 2-stage de sign, to provide the option for 
early evaluation and planning based on an initial efficacy sign al. The sample sizes for each cohort 
are calculated based on assumptions of true (target) and histor ic ORR for each tumor type. A 
2-stage design provides criteria for the option to stop early f or fut ility, a nd an understanding of an 
early signal of preliminary, strong antitumor activity. Approxi mately 5 to 9 subjects will be treated

in each of the cohorts, based on the Fleming (optimal) design c riteria. Enrollment may continue 
after the initial 5 subjects to ensure that sufficient subjects are evaluable (eg, with tumor scans) or 
in case of early drop outs. In addition to fu tility, an e fficacy boundary is shown (Table 8.1-2); 
however there will be no stopping due to an efficacy signal. 
In summary, approximately up to 45 subjects are expected to be treated across the Initial 
monotherapy cohorts, with approximately 5 to 9 subjects per coh ort (Table 8.1-2).

All subjects who receive study medication will be included in t he safety data set. 
8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary objective (to assess the safety and tolerability an d to define the DLTs and MTD of 
BMS-986158) w ill be measured by the pr imary endpoints of: Incidence of AEs at their worst grade, 
SAEs at their worst grade, AEs leading to discontinuations, deat hs, and frequency of laboratory 
test toxicity grade shifting from baseline. Safety will be eval uated from the time that the subject 
signs the informed consent, and for up to 30 days and 100 days after the last dose of BMS-986158 
monotherapy or B MS-986158 in combination with nivolumab, respec tively, or un til resolution of 
any AE for which alternative causes could not be identified resol ve to ≤Grade 1 or baseline or 
until the event has stabilized, whichever is longer.
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The endpoint(s) used to measure efficacy, PK, and ECG objective s are described below: 
8.3.2.1 EfficacyThe first secondary ob jective (efficacy) will be based on RECIST v1.1 for solid tumor s 
(Appendix 4 ), Lugano 2014 criteria for hematologic malignancies (Appendix 9 ), or PCWG3

criteria for prostate cancer (CRPC or NEPC) ( Appendix 12) using the following secondary 
endpoints:
•Best overall response (BOR): defin ed as the best response desig nation, recorded between the 
dates of first dose and the date of first objectively documented progression (per RECIST v1.1 
for solid tumors, Lugano 2014 criteria for hematologic malignanc ies or PCWG3 for prostate
cancer) or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs fir st. CR or PR determinations 
included in the BOR for solid tumor assessments must be confirm ed by a second scan 
performed no less than 4 weeks, and for hematologic malignancies , no less th an 2 weeks after 
the criteria for response are fi rst met. For subjects without do cumented progression or 
subsequent therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the BOR assessment. For subjects who continue treatmen t beyond progression or begin subsequent therapy, the BOR 
should be determined based on response designations recorded up  to the time of the initial 
evaluation (RECIST v1.1 for solid tumors, Lugano 2014 criteria for  hematologic malignancies
or PCWG3 criteria for prostate cancer [CRPC or NEPC]) defined progression or subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first. For those subjects who have su rgical resection, only pre-
surgical tumor assessm ents will be considered in the determinat i on of BOR. A BOR of SD 
requires a minimum of 49 days on study from date of first dose to the date of the first imaging 
assessment.
•ORR: defined as the total number of subjects whose BOR is either a CR or PR divided by the 
total number of subjects in the population of interest 
•Duration of Response (DOR): defined for a subject with confirmed  response as the time 
between the date of first response and the date of the first ob jectively documented disease 
progression (as determined by RECIST v1.1 for solid tumors, Lugano 2014 criteria for 
hematologic malignancies, or PCWG3 (including PSA assessments) fo r prostate cancer 
[CRPC or NEPC]), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs firs t. For those subjects who 
remain alive and have not progressed, duration of response will  be censored on the date of last 
tumor assessment. Subjects who started subsequent therapy withou t a prior reported 
progression will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent 
anticancer therapy. Response duration will only be evaluated in  subjects with a BOR of CR or 
PR.
•PFS: defined as the time from the first dose of study medication to the date of the first objective documentation of t umor progression or d eath due to any cause. Clinical d eterioration in the
absence of radiographic evidence is not considered progression for the purpose of determining 
PFS. Subjects who neith er progressed nor died w ill be censored on the date of their last tumor 
assessment. Subjects who did not have any on-study tumor assess ments will be censored on 
the date of the first dose of study medication. Subjects who started subsequent therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored at the last tumor  assessment prior to initiation of 
the subsequent anticancer therapy.
•Progression Free Survival Rate (PFSR) at week ͂t̓: defined as the proportion of subjects 
who remain progression free and surviving at ͂t̓weeks (t=12, 24). The proportion will be 
calculated by the product- limit met hod (Kaplan-Meier estimate) which takes into account 
censored data.

9.1.2 Monitoring
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity . On site they will review study records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with th e investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable. 
In addition, the s tudy may be evalu ated by BMS internal auditors and government inspectors who 
must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other st udy f iles, and study  facilities . BMS 
audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections sch eduled by regulatory aut horities, 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to BMS.

9.1.2.1 Source Documentation
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source da ta are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and att ributable, whether the data ar e hand-written on paper or entered 
electronically. If source  data are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computer ized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such s ystems must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic rec ords and/or electronic signatures. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/healt h records (EMRs/EHRs), 
AE tracking/reporting, protocol required assessments, and/or dru g accountability records).
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform regulated 
activities, such paper records should be certified copies. A ce rtified copy consists of a copy of 
original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy 
having all of the same attributes a nd information as the original. 
9.1.3 Investigational Site Training
Bristol-Myers Squibb will provide quality investig ational staff training prior to study initiation. 
Training topics will include but are not limited to: GCP, AE reporting, study details and procedure, 
electronic CRFs, study documen tation, informed consent, and enrol lment of WOCBP.
9.2 Records
9.2.1 Records Retention
The investigator must retain all study rec ords and source doc uments for the maximum period 
required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or instituti on procedures, or for the period 
specified by BMS, whichever is longer. The investigator must co ntact BMS prior to destroying 
any records associated with the study.
BMS will notify the investigator when the study records are no longer needed.
If the investigator withdraws fro m the study (eg, relocation, r etirement), the records sh all be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another inv estigator, IRB). Notice of such 
transfer will be given in writing to BMS.
9.2.2 Study Drug Records 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that a c urrent disposition record of study drug 
(inventoried and dispensed) is maintained at the study site to include IP and non-investigational 
product(s). Records or logs must comply with applicable regulati ons and guidelines and should 
include:
•amount received and placed in storage area
•amount currently in storage area
•label identification number or b atch number 
•amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including uni que subject identifiers
•amount transferred to another area/site for dispensing or storag e

•amount destroyed at study site, if applicable
•amount returned to BMS
•retain samples for bioavailability/bioequivalence, if applicabl e 
•dates and initials of person responsible for Investigational Pr oduct dispensing/accountability, 
as per the Delegation of Authority Form.
BMS will provide forms  to facilitate inventory control if the i nvestigational site does not have an 
established system that meets these requirements.
9.2.3 Case Report Forms
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are der ived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source document s or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and  analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be requested for AEs a nd/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.
For sites using the BMS electronic data capture tool, electroni c CRFs will be prepared for all data 
collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregna ncy, which will be reported on the 
paper or electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, r espectively. If electronic SAE is 
not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstances 
permitted by study-specific CRF completion guidelines provided by BMS. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable reg ulatory requirement(s).
The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document si gnatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed CRF, including any paper or electronic SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly 
reviewed, signed, and dated by the investigator or qualified ph ysician who is a subinvestigator and 
who is delegated this task on the Delegation of Authority Form. For electronic CRFs, review and 
approval/signature is completed electronically through the BMS electronic data capture tool. The 
investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records o f the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet BMS training requirements and 
must only access the BMS electronic data capture tool using the  unique user account provided by 
BMS. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other individuals.

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete Abstinence Complete abstinence as defined as complete a voidance of 
heterosexual intercourse is an acceptable form of 
contraception for all study drugs. This also means that 
abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
This does not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sym ptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry 
into a clinical trial, post- ovulation met hods) and wit hdrawal, 
which are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women 
must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate 
methods of highly or less effective contraception must be 
discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego 
complete abstinence.

APPENDIX 2 SIMULATION OF MTPI VS 3 + 3 DOSE ESCALATION DESIGNS
WITH 6 DOSE LEVELS
Simulations of mTPI and 3+3 desi gns, shown below, demonstrate t hat the mTPI design has a 
greater chance of selecting the correct MTD than the 3+3 design , and treating fewer subjects at 
sub-optimal doses.
The mTPI uses a set of decisio n rules guided by simple Bayesian  models and requires a clinically 
relevant pre-determined target DLT rate and an equivalence inte rval (EI), within which any dose 
is considered close to the true maximum tolerated dose (MTD). F or this study, the selected target 
toxicity (DLT) rate is 27% and EI [25%, 29%]. The mTPI design makes decisions using the same two observed num bers as the traditional 3+3 
design, the number of DLT evaluable subjects and the number of s ubjects with DLT. Based on 
these two numbers, unit probability mass is calculated within e ach of three regions as stated 
above, and decision is based on which region has the largest unit probability mass:
•E: escalating to the higher dose if interval (0, 25%) has the l argest unit probability mass,
•S: staying at the same dose if interval [25, 29%] has the large st unit probability mass,
•D: de-escalating to the lower dose if interval (29, 100%) has t he largest unit probability mass.
At the end of the trial, MTD will be picked, by isotonic regres sion estimation method, to be the 
dose whose estimated toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate among all the tried doses.
Simulations were performed to examine the operating characteris tics of mTPI and 3 + 3 designs
for this study. Escalation decisions based on the mTPI are show n in the protocol. D ecisions 
based on the 3+3 design are shown below:
•E: no subject with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects initiall y, or at most 1 subject with 
DLT out of 6 DLT evaluable subjects after adding 3 more subjects .
•S: 1 subject with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects initially .
•D: at least 2 subjects with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects  initially, or at least 2 
subjects with DLT out of 6 DLT evaluable subjects after adding 3 more subjects at this dose
Settings for simulation:
•6 dose-toxicity scenarios, each of which with a number of 6 (exp ected) dose levels
•1000 trials per scenario
•Target toxicity (Pt) for mTPI design: 27% with Equivalence Inte rval (EI) = [25, 29%]
•mTPI: Cohort sizes of 3-4 at all dose levels, requiring a min of 3 per cohort for escalation 
decisions. Therefore 4 subjects per cohort and 25% dropout rate  were used in simulations.
•Stopping rule for mTPI: When the re are already 13 DLT evaluable subjects treated at a dose 
level, and mTPI suggested decision is to treat more subjects at this dose level, dose escalation 
can be stopped.

•Maximum number of DLT evaluable subjects for the study is 30.
•A nominal dose level of -1 is added in the tables to account fo r the case when de-escalation 
decision is made from dose level 1. However, the dose level -1 is not used in the simulations.
Dose-Toxicity Curve Scenarios
Six (6) scenarios of dose-toxicity (DLT) curves are selected to c over various possibilities and

APPENDIX 4 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) 
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
Solid tumors will be evalu ated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version  1.1 
(RECIST 1.1) guideline .1
At baseline, tumor lesions/lym ph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm ), or ൒2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h 
node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT/MRI scan (scan slice th ickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e criterion of a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT/MRI scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will co ntribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by rad iologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two  dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the ax ial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagi ttal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For 
example, an abdominal node which  is reported as being 20 mm x 3 0 mm has a short axis of 
20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this exa mple, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm 
but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes tha t have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or follow ed.
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non-Target Lesions.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including smal l lesions (longest diameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non-Target Lesions.

1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are not considered adequate  imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions. 
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identif iable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such  as CT or MRI can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component m eets the definition of 
measurability described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non-Target’ Lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) represen tative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and  measured at baseline (this means 
in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites in volved a maximum of two and 
four lesions respectively will be recorded).
Note: A maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system . For example, a maximum of 
two lung lesions can be s elected (selected fro m one lung or one  lesion from each). A maximum 
of two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on  occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short ax is for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum dia meters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as re ference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) includi ng pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Mea surements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follo w). In addition, it is  possible to record  multiple non-target lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘m ultiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
2 RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in sho rt axis to < 10 mm.

Clinical Protocol CA011001
BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
•Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
•Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes th e baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of  one or more new lesions is 
also considered progression).
•Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient i ncrease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
•Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately 
assessed as either fully resol ved or too small to measure (due to missing or poor quality 
images), and the sum of diameters of the remaining measured tar get lesions (if any) has not 
increased sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined a bove. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
2.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould alway s have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline  examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nod es are included as target 
lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a 
normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  Case report forms or other data 
collection methods may therefore be designed t o have target nodal lesions recorded in a separate 
section where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achie ve a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, 
SD and PD, the actual short axi s measurement of the nodes is to  be included in the sum of target 
lesions.
2.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Wh en this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the o pinion of the radiologist that the 
lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be record ed as 0 mm. If the lesion is 
believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to mea sure, a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned as the reference diameter. (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for 
lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when norma l and are frequently surrounded 
by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node  is believed to be present and is 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5  mm CT slice thickness (but 
should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The mea surement of these lesions is 
potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses

or progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, how ever, if the radiologist is able to
provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
2.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest di ameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target les ions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be meas ured and instead  should be a ssessed only qualitatively at the time points 
specified in the protocol.
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be  
non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)
•Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
2.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable diseaseIn this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burde n has increased sufficiently to 
merit discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the siz e of one or more non-target 
lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal pr ogression status. Pleural e ffusions, 
pericardial effusions and ascites w ill not be followed as target  or non-target lesions and will not 
contribute to response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on th e basis 
of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of targ et disease will therefore be 
extremely rare.
2.2.1.2 When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criter i o n  o f  s t u d y  e n t r y  t o  h a v e  
measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as not ed above, however, in this 
instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor in to the interpretation of an increase 
in non-measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non-targ et disease cannot be easily 
quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly non-measura ble) a useful test that can be applied 
when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consi der if the increase in overall 
disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is  comparable in magnitude to the 
increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable dis ease: ie, an increase in tumor

burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (whi ch is equivalent to a 20% 
increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include, an  increase in lymphangitic disease 
from localized to widespread, or may be described as ‘sufficient  to require a change in therapy’. 
If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be con sidered to have had overall PD at 
that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, 
the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; t herefore the increase must be 
substantial.
2.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion; therefore, some 
comments on d etection of new lesio ns are important. There are n o specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the findin g of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning te chnique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (f or example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing les ions). This is particularly 
important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or c omplete response. For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is 
not.
NOTE: Fluid co llections (pleural e ffusions, pericardial effusions , and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesions and will not contribute to response or p rogression. In the event a new 
fluid collection is seen on a post-baseline imaging exam, a com ment may be made, but the 
appearance of a new fluid collection alone s hould not result in an assessment of Progressive 
Disease (PD). A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not 
scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicat e disease progression. An example 
of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and  while on study has a CT or MRI 
brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be 
evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at bas eline. A lesion identified on 
Chest X-Ray that was not present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will result in 
Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely 
a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the dat e of the initial scan. While FDG-
PET response assessments need a dditional study, it is sometimes  reasonable to incorporate the 
use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment  of progression 
(particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis  of FDG-PET imaging can be 
identified according to the following algorithm:1. Negative FDG-PET at bas eline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
2. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: I f the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT,  this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the

date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET sca n). If the posit ive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
2.3 Response Assessment
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
disease progression or th e last response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmation and censoring rules regarding subsequent therapy. The patient’s best overall 
response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will 
also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions. Fur thermore, depending on the nature 
of the study and the protocol requirements, it may also require  confirmatory measurement.
2.3.2 Time Point ResponseAt each protocol specified time point, a response assessment oc curs. Table 2.3.2 -1 provides a 
summary of the overall response status calculation at each time  point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non-measurab le (therefore non-target) 
disease only, Table 2.3.2-2 is to be used.

aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since  SD is increasingly used as endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determinati on of comp lete or partial res ponse requires confirmation: Comp lete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point 
of ≥4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as 
in Table 2.3.3-1. When SD is believed to be best response, it m ust meet the protocol specified 
minimum time from the d ate of first treatment or randomization d ate.
For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 (± 7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subj ect is on-study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on -study of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on stu dy).  If the subject is not on-study 
for at least this am ount of t ime, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this  time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target 
lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they  may still have a measurement 
reported on scans. This measurement should be recorded even tho ugh the nodes are normal in 
order not t o overstate progression s hould it be based on increase in s ize of the nodes. As noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report 
form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that poi nt (since disease must have reappeared after CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD w as met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely  still present and in fact the patient had PR, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the orig inal CR should be changed to PR and the best 
response is PR.
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measureme nts 
must be confirmed by consecutive or subsequent repeat assessmen ts that should be performed no 
less than 28 days after the criteria for response are first met.  Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may provide confirmation of a previously identified CR even wit h an intervening NE or PR (eg, 
CR NE CR or CR PR CR). Subsequent documentation of a PR may pro vide confirmation of a 
previously identified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (eg,  PR NE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR/CRs for confirmation.
Verification of Progression : Progression of diseas e should be v erified in cases where 
progression is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then prog ression should be declared using 
the date of the initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD , then the subject is considered to 
not have progressive disease.REFERENCES

APPENDIX 8 SIMULATION OF MTPI-2 VS 3+3 DOSE ESCALATION DESIGNS 
WITH 2 DOSE LEVELS
Simulations of mTPI-2 and 3+3 designs, shown below, demonstrate that the mTPI-2 design has a 
greater chance of selecting the correct MTD than the 3+3 design , and of treating fewer subjects at 
sub-optimal doses.
The mTPI-2 design, similarly to th e mTPI, uses a pre-determined re levant target toxicity (DLT)
rate (Pt) and an equiv alence interval (EI) defined as [Pt-e1, Pt+ e2], within which any dose level is 
considered close to the true maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It re commends decisions to either 
Stay (S) at the current dose, Escalate (E), or de-escalate (D),  guided by simple Bayesian probability 
models. These decisions are related to the unit probability mass  (UMP) under the posterior 
probability distribution of a DLT r ate in the intervals [0,Pt-e1), [Pt-e1, Pt+e2], and (Pt+e2,1] of 
the [0,1] sample space corresponding to decisions of E, S, and D (or DU), respectively. 
As an escalation decision is not of interest in the combination dose safety evaluation of this study, 
a design recommendation to escalate will be used as an indicatio n to Expand more broadly at this 
dose level, (as this dose level is deemed safe to escalate). There fore the symbol E will be used to 
indicate a decision to Expand in this setting. In contrast the de cision S (Stay) indicates that this 
dose level needs to be evaluated further for safety before treati ng at this dose level in all expansion 
cohorts. For the BMS- 986158 combination with nivolumab treatmen t, the target DLT rate was set 
to 29%, and the EI is: [27%, 33%], based on known toxicity of niv olumab and adverse events rate 
of BMS-986158 to date. 
The mTPI-2 design, similarly to t he 3+3 design, provides a decisio n guide using the number of 
DLT-evaluable subjects and the number of subjects with a DLT obs erved at each dose level. 
The mTPI-2 design framework mit igates some subop timal decisions  and makes more efficient 
dose finding as compared to the original mTPI. This is achieved  by subdividing each of the three
decision intervals into equal length subintervals of length e1+e2 and calculating UMP for each of 
the subintervals within each interval. The decision w ill be based on the interval in which any of 
these subintervals has the largest UMP, under the posterior pro bability density, given the observed 
DLT data, as follows: 
•E: Expanding at this dose (Escalate if relevant) if any sub-int erval within (0, 27%) has the 
largest unit probability mass
•S: staying at the same dose if any subinterval within [27%, 33%]  has the largest unit probability 
mass,
•D: de-escalating to the lower dose if any subinterval within (3 3%, 100%) has the largest unit 
probability mass.
At the end of the tri al, MTD will be picked by isotonic regression estimatio n method to be the dose 
level whose estimated toxicity rate is closest to the target to xicity rate among all the evaluated dose
levels.

Simulations were performed to examine the operating characteris tics of mTPI-2 and 3+3 designs
for this study. Escalation decisions based on the mTPI2 are show n in the protocol. Decisions based 
on the 3+3 design are shown below:
•E: no subject with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects initiall y, or at most 1 subject with 
DLT out of 6 DLT evaluable subjects after adding 3 more subject s.
•S: 1 subject with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects initially .
•D: at least 2 subjects with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects  initially, or at least 2 subjects 
with DLT out of 6 DLT evaluable subjects after adding 3 more su bjects at this dose
Settings for simulation:
•6 dose-toxicity scenarios, each of which with a number of 2 (expe cted) dose levels
•1000 trials per scenario
•Target toxicity (Pt) for mTPI-2 design: 29% with Equivalence Int erval (EI) = [27, 33%]
•The mTPI-2: initial cohort size of 3 (or 4) followed by cohort s ize of 3 (or 4) for the remaining 
cohorts at the same (or lower if needed) dose level, requiring a minimum of 3 for a dose 
decision; Therefore cohorts of size 4 and a 25% dropout rate we re used in the simulations.
•Stopping rule for mTPI-2: When there are already 12 DLT evaluabl e subjects treated at a dose 
level, and mTPI-2 suggested decisi on is to treat more subjects at  this dose level, dose escalation 
can be stopped.
•Maximum number of DLT evaluable subjects for the study is 12.
•A nominal dose level of -1 is added in the tables to account fo r the case when de-escalation 
decision is made from dose level 1. However, the dose level -1 is not used in the simulations. 
•A Beta(1,2) prior probab ility distribution is used which c orres ponds to a 33% expected DLT 
rate assumed for the combination of nivolumab with BMS-986158.

APPENDIX 10 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS FOR IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY 
AGENTS
These general guidelines constitu te guidance to the Investigato r and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be di ligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. N on-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary t herapy for immuno-oncology drug- related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended intravenous (IV) doses may be cons idered for ambulatory patients 
with low-grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corti costeroids should be taken into 
account when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticost eroids.
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialis t, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended. The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 11 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of  the participant’s medical 
records, medical examinatio n, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence of other biological or physiological cause s. In addition, females under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, ( FSH) level > 40 
mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement thera py, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the  woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.

•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence, defined as complete absence of heterosexual intercourse, is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during 
the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the participant.

APPENDIX 12 PROSTATE CANCER WORKING GROUP 3 (PCWG3)
GUIDELINES (WITH MODIFIED RESPONSE EVALUATION 
CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS (RECIST) CRITERIA FOR SOFT 
TISSUE LESION ASSESSMENT)
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
Bone lesions s hould be evaluated with Technecium-99m based radionuclide bone scan as per 
PCWG31.
At baseline, soft tissue lesions/lymph nodes will be categorize d as measurable or non-measurable 
as follows. 
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dime nsion (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) , or ≥2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h node 
must be≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thi ckness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e criterion of a short axis of
≥15 mm by CT/MRI scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by rad iologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two  dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the ax ial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For 
example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 3 0 mm has a short axis o f 20 mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example,  20 mm should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with shor t axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short  axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non- Target Lesions.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other soft tissue lesions are considered non-measurable, in cluding small lesions (longest 
diameter < 10mm or pathologi cal lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.

Clinical Protocol CA011001
BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non-Target Lesions.
1.3 Special considerations regarding bone lesions
Bone lesions will be assessed with Technecium-99m based radionuclide bone scans as per 
PCWG3.
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non-Target’ LesionsWhen more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of 
20 lesions total (and a maximum of 5 lesions per organ system) repr esentative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.
Note: A maximum of 5 lesions can be selected per organ system. F or example, a maximum of 
5 lung lesions can be selected. A maximum of 5 lymph nodes can be  selected at baseline, as the 
lymphatic system is considered one organ.
Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short ax is for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Pel vic lymph nodes and extrapelvic 
lymph nodes (retroperitoneal, mediastinal, thoracic and other) may be reported  separately, per 
PCWG3. Measurements are not requi red and these lesions should b e followed as ‘present’, 
‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more detai ls to follow). In addition, it is 
possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the sa me organ as a single item on the case 
record form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).2 RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nod es 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
•Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
•Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes th e baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of  one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).

Date: 18-Mar-2019 242
Approved 10.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA011001
BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
•Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient i ncrease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
•Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately a ssessed
as either fully resolved or too sm all to measure (due to missi ng or poor quality images), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (i f any) has not increased 
sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above.
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
2.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline  examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case r eport forms or other data collection 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a s eparate section 
where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a sho rt axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be inc luded in the sum of target lesions.
2.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent ev aluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Whe n this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the meas urement should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned
as the reference diameter. (Note: It is less likely that this rul e will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be pre sent and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of  5 mm s hould be assigned in this circumstance as well). This 
default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potent ially non-reprodu cible, therefore 
providi ng this default value will prevent false responses or pr ogressions based upon measurement 
error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to pro vide an actual meas ure, that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
2.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the

vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitative ly at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)
•Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see below) of existing non-target 
lesions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
2.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable diseaseIn this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequi vocal progression’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has inc reased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy (see examples in Appendix 2  and further details below). A modest 
‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usu ally not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status. Ple ural effusions, pericardial effusions and ascites will not be 
followed as target or non-target lesions and will not contribut e to response or progression. The 
designation of overall progression solely on th e basis of chang e in non-target disease in the face
of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
2.2.1.2 When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, h owever, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inte rpretati on of an increase in non- measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease ca nnot be easil y quantified (by definition: 
if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can  be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden bas ed on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the incr ease that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: i.e., an increase in tumor b urden representing an additional 
73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from loca lized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘u nequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that poi nt. While it would be ideal to have

Clinical Protocol CA011001
BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very  nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial .
2.2.2 New Lesions
New bone lesions
New bone lesions s hould be evaluated as pe r PCWG3 criteria. Bone lesions will be assessed by 
radionuclide bone scan only. Radiographic progression on bone s can is defined by the following 
criteria:
•At least 2 new lesions on the first post-treatment bone scan, confirmed on the next scan 
(performed at least 6 week s later) AND with at least two additional lesions  as compared to the 
first post-treatment bone s can. Date of progression is then the date of first post- treatment scan,
•For scans after the first post-treatment scan, at least 2 new l esions relative to the first post-
treatment scan AND confirmed on a subsequent scan (performed at  least 6 weeks later). Date 
of progression is the date of the scan that first documents at least 2 new lesions relative to the 
first post-treatment scan.
New soft tissue lesions
The appearance of new malignant soft tissue lesions denotes dis ease progression; therefore, some 
comments on d etection of new lesions are  important. There are n o specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the findin g of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality 
or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. Th is is particularly important when 
the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or comp lete response. For example, necrosis of a liver 
lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusio ns, and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesions and will not contribute to response or p rogression. In the event a new fluid 
collection is see n on a post-baseline imagi ng exam, a comment m ay be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collection alone should not result in an assessm ent of Progressive Disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical locatio n that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progressio n. An example of this is the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are consider ed to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identif ied on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will res ult in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued follow-up evaluation 
will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans con firm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of t he initial scan.

2.3 Response Assessment
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
disease progression per PCWG3 cri teria, or the last response re corded, taking into account any 
requirement for confirmation and censoring rules regarding subse quent therapy. The patient’s best 
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both  target and non-target disease and 
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions . Furthermore, depending on the 
nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.
2.3.2 Time Point ResponseAt each protocol specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Ta ble 2.3.2-1 provides a 
summary of the overall re sponse status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non-measurab le (therefore non-target) disease 
only, Table 2.3.2-2 is to be used.

BMS-986158 BET Inhibitor
aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since  SD is increasingly used as endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determinati on of complete or par tial res ponse requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
≥4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.3-1. When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified 
minimum time from the d ate of first treatment o r randomization date.
For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is W eek 6 ( ±7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subje ct is on-study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-s tudy of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on stu dy).  If the subject is not on-study 
for at least this am ount of t ime, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this  time 
period w ill have a Best Res ponse of NE unless PD is identified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions 
and the nodes decrease t o ‘normal’ s ize (< 10 mm), they may st ill have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the n odes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of  the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that poin t (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was me t. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR sh ould be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tum or measurements 
must be confirmed by consecutive or subsequent repeat assessment s that should be performed no 
less than 28 days after the criteria for response are first met.  Subsequent documentati on of a  CR 
may provide confirmation of a previ ously identified CR even with  an intervening NE or PR
(eg, CR NE CR or CR PR CR). Subsequent documentation of a PR may p rovide confirmation of 
a previously identified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (eg , PR NE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR/CRs for confirmation.
Verification of Progression : Progressi on of disease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression shou ld be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subje ct is considered to not have 
progressive disease.REFERENCES

The purpose of this amendment is to add treatment in combinatio n with Nivolumab, as well as 
define the biomarker-driven tumor population for Part 2 (dose e xpansion) of the study. One of the 
treatment arm schedules (updated from “arm” to “schedule”) from  Part 1 (monotherapy dose 
escalation) and the corresponding MTD will become the dose and selected dosing schedule for 
Part 2. In Part 2, a small safety cohort of 6 to 12 subjects wil l be administered BMS-986158 in 
combination with nivolumab to ensure safety and tolerability. O nce determined safe and tolerable, 
expansion of combination therapy will occur in parallel to the B MS-986158 monotherapy 
expansion. Subjects with selected tumor types who demonstrate s pecified genetic profiles (via 
 genetic testing) will be enrolled to the expansion phase to ma ximize potential 
efficacy of monotherapy and combination therapy: ovarian, TNBC,  NSCLC, RCC, UM, UCS, 
NEPC, CRPC, NMC, ES, BL and DHL. A ll of the study design elements, including the objectives, 
DLT assessments, time and events  schedules and sample collection s, sample size, dose 
modifications , statist ical considerations, and s upporting appendices have been added or updated

Principal  Investigator:  Holly Hull, PhD 
Study  Title:  Added  sugar  intake  and brain structure  and function  
Co- Investigator(s):  Laura  Martin,  PhD 
 
 
 
I. Purpose,  Background  and Rationale  
A. Aim and Hypotheses  
1. The first 1000 days post -conception have been characterized as a critical window for 
brain development,  during  which  much  of the brain’s  growth,  structure,  and function  is 
set1. Key nutrients from maternal and infant dietary intake fuels these maturational 
processes, thus providing the potential underlying foundation for later cognitive 
development. Brain growth and development is particularly sens itive to poor nutrition 
during this window2; previous work detailed the effects of deficiencies in the status of 
folic acid, choline, iron, zinc,  iodine, and  long chain  polyunsaturated fatty  acids3. While 
nutrient deficiencies have been studied, less is kn own about the impact and timing of 
excess nutrition in relation to cognitive development4. 
 
2. Aim 1: Determine the relationship between added sugars (% calories) intake during 
pregnancy  and infancy/toddlerhood  (birth  to 24 months)  on brain structure  and function. 
Hypothesis: added sugars intake will be negatively related to brain structure 
(hippocampal volume) and function (resting state functional connectivity and P3 
amplitude). We will explore how sex modifies this relationship.  
 
Aim 2: Determine the re lationship between fructose (% calories) consumption during 
pregnancy  and infancy/toddlerhood  (birth  to 24 months)  on brain structure  and function. 
Since some studies reported relationships with fructose independently, we will explore 
relationships with fr uctose separately.  
Hypothesis: fructose intake will be negatively related to brain structure (hippocampal 
volume)  and function  (resting  state functional  connectivity  and P3 amplitude).  We will 
explore how sex modifies this relationship.  
 
B. Background  and Significance  
1. Study Significance: Brain development is a protracted process that begins in early 
gestation and continues into late adolescence. By the 8th week in gestation, the basic 
brain structures  and the central  nervous  system  are formed,  and neuron  production  and 
migration are started5. From the 8th week until delivery, the cortical and subcortical 
structures form, including the major fiber pathways. In the third trimester, myelination 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 2 of 18
  
  and growth of the hippocampus increases rapidly until around18 -24 months of age1. 
Rapid brain growth continues with a four -fold increase in brain size during early  
childhood, reaching 90% of full brain size by six years old. The first 1000 days post - 
conception have been characterized as a critical window for brain develo pment, during 
which much of the brain’s growth, structure, and function is set1. During this time, the 
brain is particularly  vulnerable  to nutrient  deficiencies,  and such deficiencies  can have a 
severe impact on cognitive development2,3. Promoting optimal development and 
cognition has clear  individual benefits, but also has  substantial economic  impact6-8. The 
prevention of later developmental deficits is estimated to save $6B annually9,10. 
 
The concept that early development disproportionately affects later outcomes is widely 
accepted in the developmental sciences11-15, and the nutrition literature16-22. Thus far, 
most research has focused on key early life nutrient deficiencies2,4,16. Prenatal and 
postnatal  long-chain  polyuns aturated  fatty acids (LCPUFA)23 docosahexaenoic  acid (DHA) 
and arachidonic acid (AA), iron24-27, and zinc28-30 promote brain structure development, 
myelination, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, synaptogenesis and production of 
neurotransmitters. Iron deficiency is related to decreased language skills and fine -motor 
skills31,32  and supplementing iron, copper, and zinc improved attention measures33. 
Nutrient  intake  strongly  supports  the normal  development  of underlying  neural  structure 
and function that is critical for later cognitive development. While the effect of nutrient 
deficiencies is reported, the impact of excess nutrition is less studied.  
 
2. The impact of excess  nutrient  intake  on brain development  and function has  garnered  far 
less consideration compared to nutrient deficiencies. Data suggest that added sugars 
intake  during  pregnancy,  infancy,  and toddlerhood  may interfere  with the early formation 
of the brain structures that contribute  to learning  and memory34. Fructose  is of particular 
interest here, as it is one of six monosaccharides represented in added sugars35, and is 
found in the diet as a sweetener commonly added to foods during processing in the form 
of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and sucrose, a disacch aride made of a glucose bound 
to a fructose36. HFCS is a low -cost sweetener commonly used in sugar sweetened 
beverages (SSB). The effect of fructose may be due to fructose metabolism not being 
tightly regulated like glucose metabolism36 leading to oxidativ e stress and an 
inflammatory response37. 
 
3. Literature Review: The literature suggests that added sugars intake in early life exceeds 
recommendations. Added sugars are defined as sugars and syrups added as an  
ingredient to foods during processing, preparatio n, or at the table, while total sugars 
include added sugars plus sugar naturally occurring in foods (e.g., fruit and milk)35. One 
added  sugar  in particular,  fructose  (e.g.,  high fructose  corn syrup),  has been investigated 
as a driver of the negative relationships reported between added sugars and health 
outcomes38. Pregnant women are recommended to consume <10% of calories/day from 
added  sugars, whereas  infants  and toddlers  (<24 months)  are recommended  to consume 
no added sugars39. Even so, p regnant women are reported to consume 15.8% of 
calories/day from added sugars40, and 6 - to 24-month -olds to consume 1.4 -7.2% of 
calories/day from added sugars41,42. Data in pregnant women and infants and toddlers 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 3 of 18
  
  found 70% of pregnant women39 and 97.3% of infants and toddlers consumed added 
sugars in each day43. While this is concerning given the relationships between added 
sugars  intake  and chronic  disease  development44-46, evidence  is growing  that early  added 
sugars intake is also related to diminished cognitive function47.  
 
In adolescent rodents and humans, added sugars (including fructose) negatively 
impacted the hippocampal structure and connectivity48, increased hippocampal 
inflammation49, and impaired hippocampal -dependent memory50. Huma n data from the 
prenatal  period  and infancy  are lacking,  but one published  study34 found  greater  maternal 
prenatal consumption of added sugars was related to poorer cortical organization, and 
greater maternal fructose intake during lactation was related to lower scores in the 
offspring on the Bayley -III Scales of Infant Development at 24 months old51. These 
preliminary studies are consistent with the hypothesis that added sugars intake during 
pregnancy, infancy, and toddlerhood may interfere with the development and early 
formation of neural circuits34, perhaps owing to increased oxidative 
stress/inflammation49,52,53  or decreased production of brain derived neurotrophic factor 
(supports brain development and circuit formation)52,54, leading to subo ptimal cognitive 
outcome. This hypothesis was further supported by preliminary data from our own 
laboratory, which found that added sugars intake during the first two years of life was 
related  to lower  scores on  standardized cognitive  tests from 18  months  to 6 years of  age. 
The purpose of this proposal is to understand the relationship between maternal and  
early offspring (birth to 24 months) added sugars  intake  and brain structure and function 
at 5-6 years of age.  
 
In 7–11-year-old children48, increased  intake  of fructose  and glucose  was associated  with 
increased right hippocampal CA2/3 subfield volume, and increased fructose intake was 
associated with mean diffusivity  in the right cingulate -prefrontal cortex connections.  This 
suggests an impact  on hippocampal structure related to an increase in hippocampal 
inflammation. In the Project Viva cohort55, greater maternal prenatal intake of SSB was 
related to poorer offspring global intelligence. Greater maternal prenatal added sugars 
consumption was also related to lower newborn gray matter at 3 weeks old, including 
areas for later cognitive functioning34, suggesting an impact on formation of dendrites 
and synapses. This cohort was tested again at 24 months using the Bayley -III Scales of 
Infant Develo pment56. Greater maternal SSB intake was related to lower scores on the 
Bayley -III. These data provide evidence for a relationship between maternal added 
sugars intake and the brain structures that are the foundation for future cognitive 
development.  
C. Ratio nale 
1. As described  above,  there  is a growing  body of evidence  to suggest  that excess  added 
sugar intake negatively affects cognition.  
2. The innovation for this proposal involves a shift with respect to the theoretical approach 
around the relationship between cognition and nutrition. While the impact of key nutrient 
deficiencies  on cognition  is well documented,  the relationship  between  excess  intake  (i.e., 
added sugars) and cognitive development has not been previously studied. Further, data 
are lacking on exposure timing relative to the impact on cognition and brain 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 4 of 18
  
  development. This proposal will investigate three time periods that are well established 
windows of brain development that are sensitive to nutrient exposures: the prenatal, 
infancy, and toddlerhood time periods.  
3. n/a – this study  is not designed  to improve  the diagnosis  or treatment  of a disease  
II. Research  Plan and Design  
A. Study Objectives:  This purpose of this study is to fill a gap in the literature by providing an 
understanding of the relationship between added sugars and fructose intake during sensitive 
windows to brain structure and function. This project is uni que because we can determine  
the effect  of added  sugars  during  three  different  times:  pregnancy,  infancy,  and toddlerhood.  
 
Primary  Aims:  
Aim 1: Determine the relationship between added sugars (% calories) intake during 
pregnancy  and infancy/toddlerhood  (birth  to 24 months)  on brain structure  and function.  
 
Aim 2: Determine the relationship between fructose (% calories) consumption during 
pregnancy  and infancy/toddlerhood  (birth  to 24 months)  on brain structure  and function.  
 
Secondary  Aims: 
Secondary  Aim 1: Determine  the relationship  between  added  sugars  (% calories)  intake 
during pregnancy and infancy/toddlerhood (birth to 24 months) on cognition.  
 
B. Study  Type  and Design:  This is a non-interventional,  observational  study.  
 
Added  sugar  intake  during  pregnancy  will be assessed  using  dietary  data collected  between 
12-20 wks gestation using the using the National Cancer institute (NCI) DHQ -II food 
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) or three 24 -hour dietary recal ls. 
 
Offspring dietary intake was collected at 2 weeks and at 6, 12, and 24 months by one 
multiple -pass 24-hour dietary  recall  administered  to the child’s  caregiver  and collected  by 
trained research staff.  
 
For the present  study,  we will collect  three  total dietary  recalls:  two weekday  and one on the 
weekend.  
 
Brain structure  and function  will be measured  using  MRI and EEG assessments.  Cognition  will 
be measured using dimensional change card sort task and Peabody picture vocabulary test.  
 
C. Sample  size,  statistical  methods,  and power  calculation

E. Specific  methods  and techniques  used  throughout  the study  
1. Laboratory  tests:  n/a 
2. Study  Procedures:  
Dietary assessment: Three multiple -pass 24 -hour dietary recall will be administered to 
the child/child’s caregiver  and collected  by trained  research staff  to characterize  energy 
and nutrient intake of the child. 24 -hour recalls accurately estimate dietary intake57,58 
and contain less reporting bias than diet records57,59. The recalls are entered into the 
Nutrition  Data System  for Research  (NDS -R, version  2021,  Minneapolis,  MN) for macro - 
and micronutrient analysis including added sugars.  
 
Dimensional Change  Card Sort (DCCS) task.  This test is  based on the basic  paradigms of 
discrimination learning65,66, which was a focus  of our laboratory’s research program 
during the 1990s67,68. This particular task is administered according to the protocol 
published by69, and has also been used in other nutritional studies, as well as in our 
research program on the development of attent ion in preschoolers70. Essentially, 
participants are presented with stimuli that can be sorted on various dimensions (e.g., 
shape or color).  They are asked to sort the stimuli on one dimension (thus providing a 
measure  of performance  on that ability)  but then are asked  to reverse  (i.e., “switch”)  the 
rule. At that point, they must inhibit the previously activated rule in order to perform 
correctly under the new rules.  For this particular task, children are presented a game in 
which they must s ort 7 “red bunny” cards and 7 “blue car” cards into one of two boxes. 
One box is “labeled” with a red car and the other with a blue bunny.  The child is asked 
to play either the “color game,” with red bunnies sorted (face down) into the “red car” 
box; blue cars sorted (face down) into the “blue bunny” box; or they are asked to play 
the “shape game,” with blue cars sorted (face down) into the “red car” box and red 
bunnies sorted (face down) into the “blue bunny” box.  The protocol is to administer two 
practice  trials, and then 6 trials with varying levels of support as needed (i.e., 
instructions may be repeated, or cards may be identified as a scaffold for the production 
of strategies) although the answers are never given to the child.  If children perform 5 
out of 6 trials correctly, the game is switched to the opposite (i.e., shape -to-color or 
color-to-shape).  Should the child successfully negotiates the switch, the task would 
proceed  with the “border  version”  of the task, where  half of 12 sorting  cards  have a black 
border around the picture, and the child is asked to play “color game” when the card has 
a black border and “shape game” when it does not; here, there are 12 trials, but no 
game -switch phase.  Correct responses are recorded for each phase, and perform ance is 
also qualitative characterized as 0 (fail pre -switch phase), 1 (pass pre -switch, fail post - 
switch), 2 (pass the pre - and post -switch phases, but fail border phase), and 3 (pass all 
phases). The DCCS task will take approximately 15 minutes.  
 
Peabod y Picture  Vocabulary  Test (PPVT).  Receptive  vocabulary  will be assessed  using  the 
PPVT-4. The PPVT-4 is a nationally  standardized  assessment  of receptive  vocabulary  that 
has been shown to be fair with respect to cultural and economic status71. In this task, 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 6 of 18
  
  participants are shown pages depicting 4 pictorial choices. For each page, the examiner 
says a word, and the participant indicates, either by pointing or by stating a reference 
number, which picture best matches the word. Administration is simple and 
straightforward.  The PPVT -4 yields a standard score normed with a mean of 100 and a 
standard deviation of fifteen. It takes about 30 minutes to complete.  
 
If one or both cognitive tests (DCCS and PPVT) are not completed at the second study 
visit for any reason, such as subject fatigue, the study team can ask the family if they 
are willing to come back at a later date for completion of the test(s). Compensation of 
an additional $50 would be provided if an additional visit is completed.  
 
Dual energ y x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan:  (Prodigy, Madison, WI, encore software 
version 13.60) will be used to measure body composition and regional AT distribution. 
The DXA is located within the Dietetics & Nutrition Clinic inside the Smith West building 
at KUM C. Using specific anatomic landmarks as previously described, regions including 
the arms, legs and trunk will be demarcated72. Calculations for FM in each region and 
summed for regions comprising the central (trunk) and peripheral (arms plus legs) will 
be completed.  If a child moves  during  the scan the scan may need to  be re-done but no 
more than 2 scans will be given over the duration of the study. The DXA scan takes 
about 10 minutes.  
 
If there is movement during the first DXA scan and the study team and/or parent does 
not think the child will lay still for a second  scan,  the family  may be asked  if they would 
come  back a different day  to complete a second DXA.  As stated above, no  more than 2 
scans will be given over the duration of the study. Compensat ion of an additional $50 
would be provided if an additional visit to repeat the DXA scan is completed.  
 
Anthropometry:  Body weight  will be assessed  on a same  calibrated  scale (Detetco  Scales, 
Webb City, MO). Standing height will be measured using a wall mounted stadiometer 
(Accu -Hite, Seca Corp,  Hanover,  MD). Subjects  will remove  shoes  and be centered  on the 
stadiometer. Height will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. Two measurements will be 
taken and the average will be recorded. The measurements ta ke about 5 minutes to 
complete.  
 
Skinfolds:  Six skinfolds  will be measured  to represent  AT distribution  in order  to compare 
to larger trials that do not have DXA. Dr. Hull has published using these methods to 
assess infant FM distribution73 and it has been  argued skinfolds are a valid metric of 
regional FM74. All measurements will be collected using standardized procedures to our 
Laboratory and will take place on the same day as the body composition assessment by 
DXA using standardized procedures. All skinfolds will be identified using anatomical 
landmarks an d taken on the right side of the body using Lange calipers (Beta 
Technology, Santa Cruz, CA). Skinfolds will be taken in order from head to toe and then 
repeated in that same order. If two skinfold measurements differ by more than 1 mm, a 
third measurement  will be taken. The two measurements within 1 mm will be averaged 
and used for analysis. Biceps and triceps skinfolds will be measured at the midline of the 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 7 of 18
  
  anterior and posterior surface of the arm, respectively, on the mid -point between 
acromial process of the scapula and olecranon process of the ulna. Subscapular skinfold 
will be measured at the lower angle of the scapula. Suprailiac skinfold will be measured 
anteriorly to the midaxillary line and superiorly to the iliac crest, along the natural 
cleavage  of the skin. The thigh skinfold will be measured at the mid -point between 
patella (kneecap) and inguinal crease at the anterior surface of the thigh. Flank skinfold 
will be measured immediately above the iliac crest at the mid -axillary line. Central FM 
will be calculated by adding the subscapular, suprailiac and flank skinfolds and dividing 
by two. Peripheral FM will be calculated by adding the thigh, biceps and triceps skinfolds 
and dividing by three. The skinfolds take about 15 minutes to complete.  
 
If the anthropometric and/or skinfold measurements are not completed at the second 
study visit, for any reason, the study team can ask the family if they are willing to come 
back at a later date for completion of the measurements. Compensation of an additional  
$50 would be provided if an additional visit is completed.  
 
3. Measuring height and weight are part of usual care for this population. No other 
procedures  are part of  usual  care. None of the tests or measurements  will be billed  to 
insurance.  
4. n/a – no tissue  samples  will be collected

F. Risk/benefit  assessment:  No appreciable  risk of physical,  psychological,  social,  legal or 
other harm is expected.  
Physical risk: The DXA exposes the subject to a small  amount  of radiation  during  the 
scan. One DXA scan is equivalent  to approximately 2 hours of natural background 
radiation. To minimize radiation exposure, no more than two DXA scans will be 
completed for this study. Subjects may feel a light pinch when  calipers  are used to 
measure  skinfolds.  Study  staff will be adequately  trained  and use gentle techniques to 
minimize discomfort.  
1. Psychological  risk: Some  children  may get tired during  the cognition  tests and not 
perform at their best

KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 10 of 18
  
  4. The recruitment diagram and recruitment postcard will be sent to potential participants 
who express  interest  when  spoken  to on the phone  and agree  to have the materials  sent 
electronically. These  handouts  are intended to provide  a simple,  visual overview of what 
the entails. They will be accompanied by the more detailed verbal explanation provided 
by the study team via phone.  
 
B. Screening  Interview/questionnaire : The general  health  screener  will be sent to parent 
to complete. This has questions to assess MRI safety and if the child has been diagnosed 
with autism.  
 
C. Informed  consent  process  and timing  of obtaining  of consent  
1. Sarah  Crawford,  Laura Castro  de Santiago  will be in charge of obtaining written consent.  
2. The consent process will occur via phone or in a private room with only approved study 
personnel present. The electronic consent form is structured in different sections 
including study purpose, study procedures, risks and benefi ts, additional information 
(cost, payment, funding, voluntary reminder), privacy protection, stopping the study,  
and lastly the consent page with signature fields. Each section is a different page, so the 
interviewee  has to  advance  to the next section. The  interviewer  will verbally  explain each 
section to the potential participant. By structuring the form in sections, participants 
receive small amounts of information at a time making it easier to understand. It also 
creates a natural pause after each sectio n, at which time the interviewer will give the 
participant  the opportunity  to ask any questions.  After the consent  interview,  participants 
will be given the opportunity to think about the decision and discuss privately with their 
spouse/partner if applicab le. If consent interview occurs in -person, the study team 
member  will step out of the  room should  they want time  to think/discuss  privately.  If the 
consent occurs via phone, a second phone call will be scheduled to actually sign the 
consent if they choose to do so.  
3. All subjects  will be minors,  therefore  a legal guardian  will give informed consent  for all 
subjects.  
 
D. Alternatives  to Participation:  As stated  in the consent  form,  a parent  can choose  not to 
have their child participate.  
 
E. Costs to Subjects: n/a – all study tests and procedures will be provided by the study. No 
study -related  procedures  will be billed  to insurance.  A subject’s  health  insurance  status  will 
not impact their ability to participate.   
 
F. How new information will be conveyed to the study subject and how it will be 
documented:  New information  will be conveyed  to the study  subject  in writing,  via a letter. 
A dated copy of the letter will be kept in their research record to document that the 
information was provided. Reconsent will occur if required by the IRB.  
 
G. Payment, including a prorated plan for payment: Subjects will receive $100 per visit 
attended. The reimbursement will be requested to the ClinCard after each study visit is 
completed. If a subject cho oses to withdraw, they will only receive compensation for the 
study  visit(s)  completed.  Reimbursement  for travel  expenses  may be available,  but will need 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 11 of 18
  
  to be pre -approved by the PI.  
 
H. Payment for a research -related injury: Treatment for research -related i njury will be 
provided  at usual charge.  Claims  will be submitted  to the subject’s  health  insurance  policy, 
government program, or other third party. The subject will be billed for any costs not 
covered by the insurance.  
 
IV. Data  Collection  and Protection  
A. Data  Management  and Security:  
1. In addition  to the PI, Co-I, and IRB-approved  study  team members,  data monitors  and 
auditors from the IRB and regulatory authorities will have access to study data.  
2. To maintain confidentiality, subjects will be given a non -identifiable study ID number. 
Research records containing identifiable information will be kept in Dr. Hull’s locked 
research  laboratory.  All study  records  will be retained  for 25 years,  per university  policy 
for pediatric studies.  
3. Subjects  will be identified  by their study  ID number.  
4. The study  coordinators  will maintain  and have access  to the information  that links the 
subject’s identity to their study ID number.  
5. Data will be linked  to the subject  using  their assigned  study  ID number.  
6. Data will be stored  on the KUMC  RedCap  server  and university  P-drive.  Only IRB- 
approved study team members will have access to the data.  
7. iPads may be used for electronic  data entry during  study  visits.  All data collected  via iPad 
will be entered into RedCap and stored on the KUMC RedCap server.  A study specific 
iPad will be used to take and temporarily save photos of children during the DXA scan . 
The iPad is passcode protected and only approved members of the study team have 
access. After each visit, photos will be saved to the university P -drive and deleted from 
the iPad. If the parent consents yes to the future use of photos, photos will be kept on 
the P-drive for possible future use in presentations and publications of the r esearch in 
accordance with the optional multimedia consent and KUMC multimedia authorization 
form. If the parent consents no to the future use of photos, all photos of the participant 
will be deleted after sharing them with the participant as a memento of their 
participation.  
8. n/a – no identifiable  data will be sent outside  KUMC  
 
B. Sample  / Specimen  Collection:  n/a – no samples  will be collected  
 
C. Tissue  Banking  Considerations:  n/a – no samples  will be collected,  therefore  no samples 
will be available to bank 
D. Procedures to protect subject confidentiality : There is no appreciable risk of loss of 
confidentiality.  Subjects  will be made  aware  of persons  who may see their protected  health 
information in the informed consent document and may choose not to enroll in the study 
based on the information provided them in accord with 2003 HIPAA regulations. The 
patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the 
extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations.  
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 12 of 18
  
  E. Qual ity Assurance  / Monitoring  
1. All data entry  will verified  by a second  study  team member  using  the original  source 
document to ensure data are accurate, consistent, complete and reliable.  
2. n/a – no plans  to have ongoing  third-party monitoring  
 
V. Data  Analysis  and Reporting  
A. Statistical  and Data  Analysis:  The data analysis  plan for each primary  aim is described 
below. There are no planned interim analyses.  
1. Aim 1 analysis: Determine the relationship between added sugars (grams and % 
calories) intake durin g pregnancy and infancy/toddlerhood (birth to 24 months) on brain 
structure and function. Brain structure will be quantified as brain volume in Freesurfer. 
Based on prior studies, we will examine the Pearson correlation between hippocampal 
brain volume and  added sugars intake during pregnancy and infancy/toddlerhood. 
Exploratory analyses will examine correlations with added sugars intake and brain 
volume  in inhibitory  control  brain regions  (i.e., dorsal  anterior  cortex)  and reward  related 
regions (i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Brain function will be quantified as resting 
state functional connectivity within the default mode network which includes prefrontal 
and parietal regions as well as the attention and salience networks. Pearson correl ations 
will examine the relationship between functional connectivity metrics and added sugars 
intake. Brain function during the EEG Food Go/NoGo task will be quantified as the 
amplitude of the P3 and N2 components and correlations will examine the relation ship 
between P3/N2 amplitudes and added sugars. Analyses will be corrected for multiple 
comparisons using a Bonferroni correction.  
2. Aim 2 analysis: Determine the relationship between fructose (grams and % calories) 
consumption during pregnancy and infancy/t oddlerhood (birth to 24 months) on brain 
structure and function. As in Aim 1 analyses, brain structure will be quantified as 
Freesurfer volumes, brain function will be quantified as resting state connectivity, and 
brain activation  during  the EEG Food Go/No Go Task.  Correlations  will be used to examine 
the relationship between brain measures and fructose consumption.  
 
B. Outcome : We hypothesize that added sugars and fructose intake will be negatively related 
to brain structure (hippocampal volume) and function ( resting state functional connectivity 
and P3 amplitude).  The strength of  the correlations  and level of significance  will determine  if 
there is a relationship between variables being tested.  
 
C. Study results to participants : Study participants will be informed of the overall study 
results  via a letter,  which  will be mailed  after the study  and analysis  is complete.  Participants 
will not be given their individual results from study procedures; however, this information 
may be made available upon request, with approval by the PI.  
 
D. Publication Plan : The present study is a pilot. This project was submitted as a June 2022 
R01 and received  positive  reviews.  It will be resubmitted  in November  2022 with the hope of 
receiving R01 funding to extend the study to the entire ADORE GAINS cohort. We hope by 
getting more participants to complete the cognitive tests and body composition 
measurements that we will have a large enough sample to publish results relating to tho se 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 13 of 18
  
  measurements. Any publications would further support the R01 application.

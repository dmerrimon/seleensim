2Rationale for Amend ment 8
This document describes the changes to the protocol incorporating Amendment 8. The 
primary  rationale f or thi s amendment is to modify  the study  procedures and assessments for 
patients still on study  at the time of the final analysis. The final analysis data cutoff has been 
conducted and as such, the study  isconsidered complete for statist ical analysis purposes . All 
patients will  be unblinded. Only  patients who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit but 
who do not have other means of access to the s tudy drugs will  continue on the study .
Because no further formal statistical analyses will be performed, only assessments 
contributing to long- term safety monitoring are required. Most study  assessments besides 
safet y are discont inued to ease the burden of protocol -mandated assessments on patients.
Patients still on treatment at the time of the final analysis: 
Patients continuing their current study  treatm ent may  do so until  such time as other 
means of accessing the study  drugs are arranged. When possible, patients shoul d 
complete an End of Treatment (EOT) visit and transit ion onto an alternative supply o f 
(eg, commercially  available) ixazomib (MLN9708) and/or LenDex, or on to another 
standard of care treatment. Discont inued pat ients will be treated by  their physician per 
local standard of care.
Patients who are receiving ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (LenDex) 
will cont inue to receive ixazo mib plus LenDex.  Patients who are receiving placebo plus 
LenDex will receive LenDex only; the placebo cap sule will no longer be administered 
and pat ients receiving placebo will not be crossed over to ixazo mib in this study .
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, data collection requirements will be limit ed to 
collect ion of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse e vents (SAEs), laboratory  
assessments of safet y, physical examinat ions, and concomitant medicat ions. Qualit y of 
life, healt h care utilizat ion, EQ -5D, and pain assessments are discont inued. Survival data 
will no l onger be co llected because the analysis o f overall survival (OS) will be 
complete at the time of the final analysis. Other study  assessments are no l onger 
requi red, as noted in the new Schedule of Events (the previous, full Schedule of Events 
is now moved to Section 15.12 for reference only).
Patients in the OS Follow -Up Period at the time of the final analysis:
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, patients will no longer be fo llowed in the OS 
Follow-Up Peri od. The EQ-5D and skeletal -related event assessments are discont inued. 
Survival data will no longer be collected because the analysis o f OS will  be com plete at 
the time o f the final analysis. 
Descript ions of how to manage study  procedures during unavo idable circumstances, such as 
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, have addit ionally  been added.

4PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Study Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter Study Comparing Oral MLN9708 
Plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone Versus Placebo Plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Adult Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Study Phase: 3
Number of Patients: Approximately 703
Study Objectives
Note that the primary objective and corresponding endpoint have been met. Upon implementation of 
Amendment 8, the objective is to continue to collect long-term safety data from patients who are 
continuing on ixazomib (MLN9708) and LenDex or LenDex (note the placebo capsule will be 
discontinued) because of continuing clinical benefit. Data collection for all other study objectives 
and endpoints will be complete at the time of the final analysis and no further formal analyses will be conducted. The original lists of objectives are retained below for reference only.
Primary Objective:
!To determine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to the background therapy of 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone improves progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with 
relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)
Key Secondary Objectives:
!To determine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
improves overall survival (OS)
!To determine whether the addition of oral MLN9708 to lenalidomide and dexamethasone improves the OS in high-risk patients carrying deletion del(17)
Other Secondary Objectives:
!To determine overall response rate (ORR), including partial response (PR), very good partial 
response (VGPR), and complete response (CR)
!To determine CR + VGPR
!To determine duration of response (DOR)
!To determine time to progression (TTP)
!To determine the safety of the addition of MLN9708 to lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
!To determine pain re sponse rate, as assessed by the BPI-SF and analgesic use
!To assess change in global health status, functioning, and symptoms as measured by the 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionn aire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and MY-20 module
!To determine the PFS and OS in high-risk cytogenetic patient groups such as translocations 
t(4;14), t(14;16), +1q, del(13), or del(17)
!To evaluate the potential relationship between response or resistance to MLN9708 treatment and proteasome and NFKB-related genes, such as PSMB1 and TRAF-3 in blood samples 
!To collect PK data to contribute to population PK analyses

5Overview of Study Design: 
This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
MLN9708 versus placebo in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who 
are treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as their standard therapy. The patient population 
will consist of adult men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, who have received 
1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, and who meet other outlined eligibility criteria.
Following the Screening period, patients who will be enrolled and treated with lenalidomide plus 
dexamethasone will be randomized to receive a study drug in a double-blind fashion, either 
MLN9708 or placebo. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into those 2 treatment arms, 
stratified by: 1 versus 2 or 3 prior therapies, proteasome-inhibitor (PI) exposed versus PI naïve, and International Staging System (ISS) stage at screening of 1 or 2 versus stage 3.
Patients will receive study drug (MLN9708 4.0 mg or matching placebo capsule) on Days 1, 8, and 
15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, 
and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients may continue to receive treatment until progressive disease or 
unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first. Dose modifications may be made based on toxicities. 
Patients with a low creatinine clearance ∀60 mL/min (or ∀50 mL/min, according to local 
label/practice) will receive a reduced lenalidomide dose of 10 mg once daily on Days 1 through 21 of 
a 28-day cycle. The lenalidomide dose may be escalated to 15 mg once daily after 2 cycles if the patient is not responding to treatment and is tolerating the treatment. If renal function normalizes (ie, 
creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min or > 50 mL/min, according to local label/practice) and the patient 
continues to tolerate this treatment, lenalidomide may then be escalated to 25 mg once daily.
Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles. Patients will be seen at regular treatment cycle 
intervals while they are participating in the study: twice a treatment cycle for the first 3 cycles, then 
once a treatment cycle for the remainder of their participation in the active treatment and, if 
applicable, the PFS and OS follow-up phases of the study. As of Amendment 6, however, the primary endpoint has been met. As such, the PFS follow-up phase has been discontinued for patients 
currently receiving study therapy.
An independent review committee (IRC) will review all cases of disease response and progression. 
Response will be assessed according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria for all patients every 4 weeks until disease progression. As of Amendment 6, however, because PFS 
follow-up is now completed for this study, for all patients still receiving study therapy, all central and investigator assessments of response and progression for protocol purposes are discontinued—IRC review will no longer be performed, and IRC response will no longer be assessed. 
All patients will continue to be followed for survival after progression. Patients will be contacted 
every 12 weeks until death or termination of the study by the sponsor.

6The final analysis da ta cutoff has been conducted and as such, the study is considered complete for 
statistical analysis purposes. All patients will be unblinded. Only patients who continue to 
demonstrate clinical benefit but who do not have other means of access to the study drugs will 
continue on the study. Because no further formal statistical analyses will be performed, only 
assessments contributing to long -term safety monitoring are required. Most study assessments 
besides safety are discontinued to ease the burden of prot ocol-mandated assessments on patients.
Patients continuing their current study treatment may do so until such time as other means of 
accessing the study drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should complete an EOT visit and 
transition onto an alterna tive supply of (eg, commercially available) ixazomib and/or LenDex, or 
onto another standard of care treatment. Discontinued patients will be treated by their physician per 
local standard of care.
Patients who are receiving ixazomib plus LenDex will contin ue to receive ixazomib plus LenDex.  
Patients who are receiving placebo plus LenDex will receive LenDex only; the placebo capsule will 
no longer be administered and patients receiving placebo will not be crossed over to ixazomib in this 
study. Upon impleme ntation of Amendment 8, data collection requirements will be limited to 
collection of AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medications. Quality of life , health utilization, EQ -5D, 
and pain assessments are discontinued. Survival data will no longer be collected becau se the analysis 
of OS will be complete at the time of the final analysis. Other study assessments are no longer 
required, as noted in the new Schedule of Events. Patients will not be followed for the OS follow -up 
period because OS data are no longer being collected.
Study Population: 
Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic MM and relapsed and/or refractory 
disease will be enrolled in this study .
Duration of Study:
The duration of the study, including enrollment, treatment, and follow -up, will be approximately 
81months.

antineoplastic therapy, whichever comes first.
cBefore dosing on Day 1 of the next full treatment cycle upon implementation of Amendment 8, patients 
must be reconsented. Reconsenting should be done in person.  Remote reconsenting is permitt ed as long as 
the process adheres to site, sponsor, IRB/EC, regulatory, and GCP standards and local regulations.
dPatients should be assessed and treated according to standard of care. Collect and record only clinically 
significant findings as AEs in the eCRF.
eAlternative methods for administering study procedures/assessments may be considered when it is not 
possible for the patient to come to the study site due to extenuating circumstances (eg, due to the COVID -19 
pandemic). Alternative methods should b e considered for performing the assessments by other means than 
the patient presenting to the clinic (eg, remote assessment, having lab assessment performed at a facility 
closer to the patient’s home, etc.) If any of the following study procedures/assessme nts is missed because a 
site visit is done remotely, the study procedure/assessment is waived: complete physical examination,

fTreatment with IMiDs requires pregnancy testing in female patients of child -bearing age prior to each cycle. 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at the local laborator y for all women of childbearing potential.
gAll central laboratory assessments are discontinued. Patien ts should be assessed and treated according to 
standard of care using local laboratory evaluations. Abnormal hematology and chemistry data are to be 
collected and recorded in the eCRF only to the extent that they are needed to document or support an AE. 
Laborato ry assessments to inform dosing decisions and routinely monitor patients do not need to be 
recorded in the eCRF.
hPatients should be assessed and treated per standard of care. All AEs/SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF 
according to the criteria outli ned in Section 10. Patient safety outside the protocol assessments should be 
monitored during the time between on -site visits at the investigator's discretion, per standard of care. At 
minimum, there will be a phone call with an investigator within the spe cified -visit window timeframe, 
which will include an assessment of AEs/SAEs.  
iConcomitant medications are to be collected and recorded in the eCRF only to the extent that they are 
needed to document an AE. 
jOnly for patients who were receiving MLN9708 in combination with LenDex. Patients who received 
placebo in combination with LenDex will receive LenDex but will no longer be administered the placebo 
capsule.

201.   BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1   Scientific Background
1.1.1    Disease Under Treatment
Multiple myel oma (MM) i s a cl onal disease of pl asma cells that is characterized by the 
accumulat ion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (and other organs) and sometimes results 
in bone m arrow failure, bone destruction, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. It constitutes 
approximately  1% of  all reported neoplasms and approximately  13% of  hematol ogic cancers 
worldwide. [1]In the Americas, Canada, and Western European coun tries, approximately 
5to 7 new cases of MM are diagnosed per 100,000 people each y ear.[
1-3] Although less 
commo n in Asian countries, MM is a growing health problem with an incidence that is 
approaching western countries and a larger populatio n base. [
4,5]In the United States, 
approximately  20,00 0 cases of MM are diagnosed each y ear and 10,650 deaths per y ear are 
due to the disease (approximately 2% of all cancer deaths). 
Although MM is uniformly  fatal, survival has dramat ically improved over the last 2 decades 
because of newer and more effect ivetreatment optio ns. Between 1990 and 2007, the cancer 
death rate for people wit h MM in the United States decreased by approximately 9% for 
males and 13% for females due to introduction of stem cell transplant and novel agents 
VELCADE®, thalido mide, and lenalido mide. [
6]Inaddition, 5 -year survival improved from 
25% in 1975 to 39% in 2006 because of the develo pment of m ore effective treatm ents. [
7]
Most patients receive mult iple therapies over the course of their disease; however, responses 
are transient despite the marked improvement in treatment options .
Multiple myel oma is sensit ive to a number of cy totoxi c drugs such as alkylat ing agents, 
anthracyclines, and corticosteroids for init ial treatment and for relapsed disease. The last 
several years have wit nessed the introduction of several agents such as V ELCADE, 
thalido mide, and lenalidomide that have improved response, and contributed to the 
improved 5
-year survival. VELCADE, the first proteasome inhibitor, has proven effect ive in 
the front line setting including improvements in overall survival, has shown marked response 
in the relapsed setting, and is an effect ive agent in the pretransplant setting.
Despite the increase in the number of therapeutic options, the disease remains incurable and 
there is a need for new and better agents. Patients who relapse a fter thei r initial therapy  
demonstrate vari able response to subsequent treatments with decreasing likelihood and 
durati on of  response (DOR). Patients ult imately become refractory  to approved therapies

21and have no alternat ive treatment options. In an effort to further target the proteasome wit h 
improved activit y in MM and other cancers, Millennium has developed MLN9708, a small 
molecule 20S proteasome inhibitor.
1.1.2    MLN9708, Millennium’s Next -Generation Proteasome Inhibitor
VELCADE (bortezomib), the first -in-class, small -molecule proteasome inhibitor developed 
by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Millennium), validated the proteasome as a therapeutic 
target. Recognizing that proteasome inhibit ion is an effect ive ant icancer therapeutic 
approach , Millennium has devel oped MLN9708 wi th the aim  of improving the 
pharmaco logy of the agent, building on the efficacy  seen wi th VELCADE in MM and other 
hematol ogic malignancies, and improving safet y and convenience of drug administration.
Like VELCADE, MLN9708 i s a m odified pepti de boroni c acid anal og. MLN9708 is the 
citrate ester of the bio logically  active di peptide boronic acid, MLN2238. MLN9708 was 
formulated to improve the chemical properties of MLN2238 for clinical delivery . MLN9708 
rapidly hydrolyzes to MLN2238 upon co ntact with either plasma or aqueous solutions. 
MLN2238 is the active form that potently, reversibly, and select ively inhibit s the 
proteasome. In contrast to VELCADE, MLN2238 demonstrates a faster dissociation rate 
from the proteasom e that m ay resul t in enh anced tum or penetrati on, exhibits ant itumor 
activit y in a broader range of tumor xenografts, and has more prolonged tissue penetration.
MLN2238 preferent ially binds the 5 site of the 20S proteasome; at higher concentrations, it 
also inhibits the activit y of the 1 and 2 sites. MLN2238 was select ive for the proteasome 
over a panel of several proteases (IC 50values between 20 and100 M), 103 kinases 
(IC 50values > 10 M), and receptors (IC 50values > 10 M). MLN2238 and bortezomib 
have different 5 proteaso me dissociat ion terminal disposit ion half -lives (t 1/2), reflect ing 
differences in their on -off binding kinet ics (the 5 proteasome dissociat ion [t 1/2] for 
MLN2238 and bortezomib are 18 and 110 minutes, respectively). Based on these favorable 
characterist ics, MLN2238 is ant icipated to be effective against MM.
1.2   Preclinical Experience
1.2.1    Nonclinical Pharmacology: In Vivo Studies
Antitumor activit y was observed wi th MLN2238 in 4 xenograft models: CWR22 (a human 
prostate cancer cell line), WSU -DLCL2, OCI- Ly7-7D1-luc, and PHTX -22L (3 human 
lympho ma cell lines). In contrast, bortezomib demonstrated weaker antitumor activit y in

22these latter 3 lymphom a models, dem onstrating that MLN2238 has improved activit y in 
nonclinical models co mpared to bortezomib. MLN2238 t reatment demonstrated an 
improved tumor pharmacodynamic response compared to bortezomib in WSU -DLCL2 
human diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) xenografts. WSU- DLCL2 xenografts from 
MLN2238 -treated mice displayed greater tumor 20S proteasome inhibit ion compared to 
xenografts fro m bortezomib -treated mice and demonstrated increased downstream 
biological  effects, as determined by protein marker expressio n. 
MLN2238 -treated xenografts displayed higher and more sustained 20S proteasome 
inhibit ion and increased downstream  biological  effects as determined by  Growth Arrest 
DNA Damage 34 (GADD34) and Activat ing Transcript ion Factor -3 (ATF -3 levels). 
MLN2238 demo nstrated both an improved efficacy pro file and pharmacodynamic response 
compared to bortezomib.
Detailed informat ion regarding the nonclinical pharmaco logy and toxi cology of MLN9708 
may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3   Clinical Experience
Like VELCADE, MLN9708 i s a m odified pepti de boroni c acid anal og. MLN9708 is the 
first investi gational ora l proteasome inhibitor in clinical trials in humans with safet y, 
tolerabilit y, PK, pharmacodynamics, and disease response assessed in each study . As of 
12October 2011, 247 patients have been treated wit h MLN9708 across 7 enrolling 
sponsor -led phase 1 or phase 1/2 studies wit h a twice -weekly and a weekly  dosing schedule 
being evaluated. Regardless o f the route of administration in the twice -weekly  dosing 
schedule, MLN9708 is given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 -day cycle and, in the weekly 
dosing schedule, the drug is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28- day cycle. Details of these 
trials can be found in ClinicalTrials.gov, the current versio n of the IB, and the sect ions to 
follow. 
In addit ion to the trials noted above and this study , there are currently  3 planned trials, each 
of which will use the oral formulat ion of MLN9708:
Study  C16008, oral (PO) twice -weekly  administrati on in combinat ion with 
lenalido mide and low -dose dexamethasone every  21 day s in adult patients with 
newly diagnosed mult iple myelo ma (ND MM)

23Study  C16009, PO administration on Day s 1 and 15 of the first 28 -day cycle to 
assess drug- drug interactions wit h ketoconazo le, relat ive bioavailabilit y, and food 
effect in pat ients with advanced so lid tumor malignances, lympho ma, or 
Waldenstroms macro globulinemia; PO administratio n in subsequent cy cles on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28- day cycle
These studies are in the process of Investigational Review Board (IRB) and Ethics 
Committee reviews, but have not y et begun to enroll pat ients. (For addit ional info rmation, 
please refer to ClinicalTrials.gov.)
Study  C16011 i s a phase 3 tri al of weekly  oral MLN9708 in combinat ion with 
dexamethasone co mpared with physician’s cho ice of treatm ent from a list of defined 
chemotherapy options, which are dexamethasone alo ne or dexam ethasone combined with 
melphalan, cyclophosphamide, thalido mide, or lenalido mide in pat ients with relapsed or 
refractory  systemic immunogl obulin light chain (AL) amylo idosi s.
Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral Formulation of MLN9708
In the 5 studi es act ively enro lling patients to investigate oral MLN9708 in pat ients with 
differing plasma cell dyscrasias (mult iple myelo ma and AL amylo idosis), a total of 
115patients have been treated thus far with different doses of MLN9708, as noted in

The em erging safet y profile indicates that oral MLN9708 is generally well tolerated with 
manageable and reversible treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or adverse 
reacti ons. As noted in Table 1-1, the m aximum  tolerated dose (MTD) has been established 
in 1 trial administering MLN9708 twice -weekly (Study  C16003, relapsed/refractory  
multiple myelo ma [RRMM]) and in 2 trials administering MLN9708 weekly as a single 
agent and in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone (LenDex) (Study  C16004, 
RRMM and Study  C16005, NDMM, respect ively) with dose escalation cont inuing in 2 other 
enrolling studies (Study  C16006, NDMM and C16007, relapsed/refractory  amyloidosis

As of 12 October 2011, 2 ongoing phase 1 clinical trials were investigating oral MLN9708 
in RRMM: Study  C16003 and Study  C16004. Both studi es have co mpleted the phase 1 
porti on of  the study  and pati ents are enrolling into defined expansion cohorts: relapse d and 
refractory  multiple myel oma, VELCADE relapsed, proteasome inhibitor naïve, or 
carfilzo mib exposed. 
Study C16003 Single -agent; Twice -Weekly MLN9708
Study  C16003 has enro lled 56 patients. These patients are heavily pretreated as evidenced 
by a median number of 4 (range 1–28) pri or lines of therapy  with 47% ref ractory  to the last 
line of therapy .
[8]Patients have received a median of 3.5 cy cles of therapy  (range 1 -23). Six 
patients have achieved at least a partial response (PR) (1 complete response [CR] and 5 
PRs); addit ionally 1 patient and 28 patients achieved minor response (MR) and durable 
disease stabilizat ion for up to 12.9 months, respectively .
[8]
In Study  C16003, 1 of 3 patients experienced a protocol -defined dose -limit ing toxicit y 
(DLT) (Grade 3 rash) at a dose of 2.23 mg/m2. An addi tional patient at this dose experienced 
Grade 4 thrombocy topeni a (platelet count of 10,000/mm3). After a di scussio n with the 
participat ing investigators, an intermediate y et lower dose was evaluated as allowed in the 
C16003 protocol and supported by  available pharmacokinet ic (PK) data to further 
characterize dose -related toxici ties. Six pati ents were treated at the intermediate dose of

262.0mg/m2, a dose approximately  half way  between the 2 exist ing dose levels of 2.23 mg/m2
and 1.68 m g/m2(a dose wi thout any  DLTs). Given that no patient (0/6) experienced a DLT, 
the MTD of PO MLN9708 administered twice weekly  was determined to be 2.0 mg/m2.[8]
A summary  of the safet y profile of pat ients treated in Study  C16003 is outlined in

28Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
As of 12 Oct 2011, 2 ongoing phase 1/2 clinical tr ials are invest igating oral MLN9708 in 
NDMM: Study  C16005 and Study  C16006.
In Study  C16005, MLN9708 is given weekly  (Days 1, 8, and 15) in combinat ion with 
lenalido mide (Days 1 -21) and dexamethasone (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 28 -day cycle. 
Enrollment to the phase 1 portion of the study  is com plete, wi th enrollment open to the 
phase 2 portion. This study  has enrolled 15 patients as of the clinical data cut (12 Oct 2011) 
to 4 dose cohorts. No DLTs were seen at doses up to 2.23 mg/m2. Three of 3 patients tr eated 
at the 3.95 mg/m2dose cohort experienced Grade 3 nausea and vomit ing despite adequate 
anti-emet ic therapy; 1 of which addit ionally  experienced Grade 2 syncope and in another 
patient the dose of lenalido mide was compro mised such that they received < 80% of the 
planned doses. As per protocol, subsequent patients were treated at 1 dose level below 
(2.97 mg/m2) where 1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT (Grade 3 rash). The MTD of weekly  
MLN9708 in co mbinat ion with a 28 -day cycle of lenalidomide and dexameth asone was 
established at 2.97 mg/m2. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) estimat ion was 
established fo llowing evaluat ion of the available data from the phase 1 portion of the trial 
which included, but was not limited to analyses of efficacy results and tox icity 
characterizat ion (Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, all grades peripheral neuropathy , and treatment 
discontinuat ion). Based on this review the RP2D dose was determined to be 2.23 mg/m2in 
this combinat ion schedule. The clinical development of MLN9708 included a p opulation PK 
analysis evaluat ing the feasibilit y of switching f rom body surface area (BSA)- based dosing 
to fixed dosing. [10] The results of this analysis support the transit ion from BSA -based 
dosing to fixed dosing. Therefore, in Study  C16005, all patients treated in the phase 2 
porti on of  the tri al will receive oral MLN9708 at a fixed dose of 4.0 mg (the RP2D dose of 
2.23 m g/m2x the m ean pat ient BSA of 1.86 m2.[
11]
As of 12 October 2011, patients in Study  C16005 have com pleted a m edian of 5 cy cles 
(range 1
-9). To date, all 15 response -evaluable patients have achieved a PR or better to 
therapy  including 4 CRs, 4 VG PRs, and 7 PRs; 14 out of 15 patients achieved PR after 
Cycle 1, and all 15 achieved PR after Cy cle 2. [11]
A summary  of the safet y profile of pat ients treated in Study  C16005 is outlined in
 Table 1-5. 
Overall, 100% of patients experienced a TEAE of any grade and o f any cause. Peripheral 
neuropathy  was limited to Grade 1 or 2 in 3 patients.

30delay in starting Cycle 2 fo r 2 weeks). The prolonged thrombocy topeni a was thought to be 
due to the patient’s underlying bone marrow reserve, as the platelet count did return to the 
patient’s baseline level but not to levels defined by the protocol. As per protocol, 
3additional patients were treated at this first dose level wit hout addit ional dose -limit ing 
toxicity (DLT); thus, the dose of MLN9708 will be escalated in the next 3 patients. Early  
signs of  activity were reported, including 3 of 6 patients with partial hematologic respon se 
after the first cy cle. As of the data cut, best clinical responses include 2 hematologic VGPR, 
1 hematol ogic PR, and stable hematologic disease after 1 cy cle of therapy  in 3 pat ients. 
TEAEs, i rrespect ive of grade or causalit y, occurring in more than 1 pati ent include di arrhea 
and peripheral edema (3 patients each); anemia, fatigue, nausea, and thrombocy topeni a 
(2patients each). No TEAEs have resulted in study drug discont inuat ion. No deaths have 
been reported. 
Clinical Trial Experience Using the IV Formulation of MLN9708
There are 2 ongoing studies invest igating intravenous (IV) MLN9708 in advanced so lid 
tumors and advanced lympho ma (Studies C16001 and C16002, respectively). As of 
12October 2011, a total of 132 patients had been treated in these studie s. Refer to the 
current version of the IB for more informat ion about the potential adverse events of the IV

Clinical Trial Safety Experience: Pooled IV and Oral Formulation
The potential risks reported with MLN9708 use, pooled fro m both IV and oral formulat ions, 
were ant icipated based on preclinical data and previous experienc e with VELCADE and are 
noted i n the MLN9708  IB and informed consent form (ICF) documents. The ty pe of TEAE 
reported is consistent, regardless o f the MLN9708 formulat io n, even though there are some 
differences in the frequency an
d severit y of the reported e vents. While the predominant 
potenti al  toxicities m ay be severe in so me cases, they are largely reversible and can be 
managed by routine clinical
 monitoring and
 standard medical interventions, which may 
include dose reductions and supportive care. Please refer to the IB
 for further information.
1.4   Study Rationale
Despite clinical advantages provi ded by  the proteasome inhibitor VELCADE and 
immuno modulatory  (IMi D) agents thalidomide and lenalidomide in both previously  
untreated and treated patients with MM, the disease remains incurable. [14] Although 
multiple therapies are available for RRMM patients, the frequent rel apses that characterize 
this disease highlight a need for new therapies for patients in who m prior treatm ents have 
failed . This study  is designed to determine whether adding MLN9708 to abackground
therapy  of lenalidomide and dexamethasone will improve the clinical outcomes of pat ients 
with RRMM.
1.4.1    Rationale for the Combination of MLN9708, Lenalidomide, and 
Dexametha sone
Clinical data support the combinat ion of a proteasome inhibitor, an IMiD, and a 
glucocorti costeroi d. The combinat ion of bortezomib, lenalido mide, and low- dose 
dexamethasone, as noted in clinical studies and theNational  Com prehensive Cancer 
Network ( NCCN) guidelines, illustrates that this combinat ion is very act ive and well 
tolerated in the MM populat ion.[15-18] From  a clinical perspect ive, adding proteasome 
inhibitors to lenalidomide and dexamethasone has demonstrated significant synergist ic 
effects. [
8,17]
Recognizing that proteasome inhibit ion is an effective ant
icancer therapeutic approach , 
Millennium developed MLN9708, which is a modified dipept ide boronic acid proteasome 
inhibitor similar to VELCADE ,with the aim  of improving the pharmaco logy of the agent 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
32and improving drug administration, while building on the efficacy  seen wi th VELCADE . 
Given that MLN9708 has improved binding kinet ics and a similar pharmaco logic profile 
compared wi th VELCADE, i t is expected that these differences will translate into simil ar, if 
not improved, efficacy and safety  profiles. [19] Nonclinical work by Chauhan and colleagues 
supports clinical evaluat ion of MLN9708 in combinat ion with lenalido mide and 
dexamethasone based on their results reporting that MLN2238 combined with lenalido mide 
or dexamethasone triggers synergistic ant i
-MM activit y.[20]
In term s of safet y, the toxi cological profile of MLN2238 in nonclinical studies is generally
consistent with class -based effects of proteasome inhibit ion and is similar to what has been 
reported previously in nonclinical studies wit h bortezomib. The most commo n TEAEs, 
regardl ess of causalit y, of single -agent MLN9708 across all dose level cohorts in all 
phase 1studi es reported to date, as discussed in Section 1.3,
 were anti cipated based on 
preclinical data and previous experience with bortez omib. Given the available data, the 
similar nonclinical toxicit y profile between MLN2238 and bortezomib, and the toxicit ies 
demonstrated in studies with lenalidomide and dexamethasone and the low potential for 
drug-drug interactions, it is ant icipated that any potential for overlapping toxicit ies wi th a 
combinat ion of MLN9708, lenalido mide, and dexamethasone can be mo nitored in the clinic 
with routine clinical observations and laboratory  tests.
Patients enrolled in both arms of C16010 will receive lenalidom ide and dexamethasone, one 
of several  regimens recommended by  the Internat ional Myelo ma Working Group (IMWG) 
as well as the NCCN. While init ial data from ongoing trials are promising regarding the 
addition of  bortezomib to thi s regimen, longer fo llow up an d data from  rando mized phase III 
studi es are still needed before bortezomib is broadly  incorporated i nto treatm ent 
recommendat ions.[21]
This study  is proposed based on the results of VELCADE in previously treated MM, [
22]the 
emerging activit y seen wi th MLN9708 in the treatment of previously  treated and u ntreated 
MM (see Section
 1.3), and the urgent need for better treatment options for this incurable 
disease. This study  is designed to determine the efficacy and safet y of MLN9708 wi th 
lenalido mide and dexamethasone, compared wi th lenalido mide and dexamethasone alone in 
patients wi th relapsed and/or refractory  MM . The primary  purpose of this study  is to 
determine the progression -free survival of pat ients in the 2 treatment groups.

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
331.4.2    Rationale for MLN9708, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone Dose and 
Schedule Selection
MLN9708 administered weekly  on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle is supported by  
nonclinical data and clinical trial results in which MLN9708 has been given as a single agent 
and in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone. The weekly schedule was well 
tolerated in in vivo toxico logy studi es and was predi cted to allow dosing on a schedule that 
produced m aximum ant itumor activit y in mouse models. Study  C16004, a phase 1 study  in 
adult pati ents wi th RRMM, invest igated single -agent MLN9708 in this weekly schedule. 
The est imated MTD is 2.97 mg/m2with DLTs of transient rash, nausea, and vo miting. 
Given that the weekly schedule o f MLN9708 co mbines well with the established 28 -day 
lenalido mide plus low -dose dexamethasone regimen providing a simple course of therapy  
for pati ents, Study  C16005, a phase 1/ 2 study  of weekly MLN9708 plus a 28 -day cycle of 
lenalido mide (25 mg on Day s 1-21) and dexamethasone (40 mg weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, 
and 22) was init iated. 
In the phase 1 portion of Study  C16005, 3 evaluable patients were enrolled in each of the 
following dose cohorts: Cohort 1 (1.68 mg/m2), Cohort 2 (2.23 mg/m2), and Cohort 3 
(2.97 mg/m2), respectively. There were no DLTs noted for any  of these patients during 
Cycle 1. Three evaluable patients were enro lled in Cohort 4 (3.95 mg/m2). DLTs were noted 
during Cycle 1 for 3 out of 3 patients in Cohort 4 at the 3.95- mg/m2dose l evel. The DLTs 
were Grade 3 faint ing/passing out, nausea, vo miting, and di arrhea. Per protocol, dosing at 
the 3.95 -mg/m2dose l evel was stopped. Since 6 patients were not enrolled at the previous 
dose l evel (2.97 mg/m2), 3 addi tional patients were enrolled at this lower dose. One of the 
additional 3 pati ents had a DLT of Grade 3 rash during Cycle 1. Therefore, DLTs were 
noted for 1 out of 6 patients enro lled at the 2.97 -mg/m2dose l evel; a ccording to the protocol, 
2.97 mg/m2was determined as MTD. 
The clinical data were evaluated for the available phase 1 data, which included the analyses 
of efficacy results (response rates: PR, VGPR, and CR) and toxicit y characteri zation 
(Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, all grades peripheral neuropathy, dose holding, and treatment 
discontinuat ion). Cy cle1 data from  15 evaluable patients were reviewed, as well as the 
available clinical data supporting tolerance over mult iple treatment cycles. AEs that met 
DLT criteria in Cycle 2 and bey ond were considered, and toxicit ies leading to dose 
modificati on in Cycle 2 and bey ond were al so consi dered.
Six patients were enro lled at the 2.97 -mg/m2dose level. All 6 patients received all doses o f 
MLN9708 and dexamethasone during Cycle 1. However, 3 out of 6 patients were not able to

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
34receive all o f their lenalidomide doses during Cycle 1 due to Grade 2 or 3 rash. Three 
patients were enrolled at the 2.23 -mg/m2dose l evel. All 3 pati ents received all doses of 
MLN9708, dexamethasone, and lenalido mide during Cycles 1 through 3, except 1 patient 
who did not receive 1 dose of dexamethasone during Cycle 2. After 4 cycles of treatment, 
the pati ents enrolled at 2.23 mg/m2achieved responses of CR, PR, and VGPR, respectively. 
All 3 pat ients achieved PR after Cy cle 1, 2 of them achieved VGPR after Cy cle 2, and CR 
after Cycle 4 and Cycle 5. Given that the dose of MLN9708 at 2.97 mg/m2significant ly 
compromised the doses of the lenalidomide and dexamethasone background regimen, and 
that the dose of 2.23 mg/m2is very tolerable and clinically  active, the clinical team has 
proposed to use 2.23 mg/m2as the dose for the pivotal phase 3 trial. More data will be 
gained fro m the phase 2 cohort of the ongoing C16005 study , in which pat ients will receive 
MLN9708 at 2.23 mg/m2. 
This recommended starting dose of 2.23 mg/m2is translated into a fixed dose of 4.0 mg 
based on the results fro m the popul ation PK analysis. At init iation of clinical development of 
MLN9708, early phase 1 clinical studies empirically used a BSA -based dosing approach that 
has been traditionally used in the development of cytotoxic anticancer agents. Accordingly, 
dosing of MLN9708 in individual pat ients was BSA -scaled (in m g/m2) in Study  C16005 and 
in 4 ongo ing single -agent tri als (Studi es C16001, C16002, C16003, and C16004). However, 
it is well known that the clearance of small mo lecule drugs is ty pically  not a linear function 
of BSA and the appropriateness of tradit ional BSA -scaled approaches for dosing ant icancer 
agents has been crit ically quest ioned in the recent scientific literature. [23-26]
Therefore, a preliminary populat ion PK analysis was performed for MLN9708 based on the
available data fro m 4 ongoing phase 1 studies to quant itatively assess the contribut ion of 
interpat ient variability in BSA to the overall interpatient variabilit y in clearance of 
MLN9708, and thereby  eval uate the feasibilit y of switching from  BSA -based do sing to fixed 
dosing in future clinical development. A population PK model was built using data fro m 
both the twice -weekly and once -weekly  IV (n =86) and oral  (n=51) dosing regimens 
(N=137). Populat ion PK analysis showed that MLN9708 PK can be well de scribed by  a 
3-compartment m odel with linear eliminat ion for IV data and with an addit ional absorption 
compartment (first order absorption) for oral data. Covariate analyses indicate that 
interpat ient variability in BSA, and/or body  weight did not signific antly contribute to the 
variabilit y in clearance (CL) and vo lume of distribution (V2) in the central co mpartment. 
Clearance and vol ume of distribut ion in the central compartment (V2) are the PK parameters 
that will affect AUC and single -dose m aximum  (peak) concentration (C max). The l ack of  a

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
35137patients over a relat ively wide BSA range (1.4 -2.6m2) indicates that total systemic 
exposure (AUC) fo llowing fixed dosing should be indepe ndent of the individual pat ient’s 
BSA (see Figure 1-1). Therefore, BSA is not expected to affect C maxor AUC after IV or oral 
dosing, and thus fixed do sing is appropriate for both oral and IV routes of administration. 
The clinical development of MLN9708 has therefore transit ioned fro m use of BSA -based 
dosing to fixed dosing in all recent ly initiated phase 1/2 studies (eg, Studies C16007, 
C16008, and C160
09).
Accordingly , the starti ng dose of MLN9708 in the proposed phase 3 study  is a fixed dose of 
4.0mg, based on the recommended dose of 2.23 mg/m2(using mean patient BSA of 1.86 m2
from the 2208 pati ents wi th MM in VELCADE clinical trials for conversio n to a fixed 
dose).

36genes mapping to chromosome 1 [27-29 ]or to outcome after single -agent VELCADE 
therapy ).[30,31] These studies highlight links between TRAF3, a key regulator of the NFKB 
pathway , and protein synthesis wit h clinical sensit ivity and resistance respect ively to 
VELCADE. A recent whole geno me sequencing study  of MM pati ents reported the presence 
of mutations in known cancer genes that had either not previously  been reported in MM 
such as BRAF, or that were present at much higher frequency in MM than previously 
reported (KRAS, NRAS). [
32]Similar studies with samples from VELCADE clin ical trials 
highlighted the link between mutations in these pathways and response to proteasome 
inhibitor. [
33]
In thi s clinical study , a screening tumor sample will be collected from each pat ient to test the 
link between clinical outcomes and the presence of specific gene mutations o f the RAF/RAS 
pathway , as well  as to test if express ion of NFKB or protein synt hesis gene signatures are 
related to the efficacy o f the MLN9708 -based co mbinat ion. This hypothesis will be tested in 
all patients. Addit ional analyses of tumor mo lecular characteristics may be done to ident ify 
biomarkers linked to clinical outcomes in this study . These tum or analyses may  include but 
are not limit ed to gene expressio n, DNA mutations, and/or epigenetic factors. Similar 
analyses will be done in tumor samples fro m patients who init ially responded to therapy  and 
subsequent ly relapsed.
Recent data also ident ify host vari ation, specifically germline DNA variants in proteasome 
subunit s [34] and the NFKB p athway  [ 35]as important contributors to VELCADE clinical 
activit y. A blood sam ple will  be collected at screening in order to te st if specific 
polymorphisms in proteasome -
related genes are associated with MLN9708 efficacy. 
Variants in NFKB -related genes will also be assessed, as they  may relate to the activat ion of 
the NFKB pathway in the tumor or in the host microenvironment, impa cting the growth, 
survival, and/or drug resistance o f a given patient’s myelo ma. Addit ional associations with 
either the efficacy  or saf ety of MLN9708 m ay be examined if there is a reasonable approach 
to identify myelo ma pat ient populations with different ial risk to benefit rati os upon 
treatm ent wi th MLN9708.
Circulat ing proteasome levels have been demonstrated to be an independent prognostic 
factor in MM pat ients with increasing circulat ing proteasome levels correlat ing with 
advance disease. [36]Given that MLN9708 directly targets the 20S proteasome, this leads to 
the possibilit y that pretreatm ent ci rculat ing proteasome levels may be relevant for predict ion 
of patient response to therapy . Retrospective analysis of baseline proteasome levels from

37and prednisone demo nstrated that circulat ing proteaso me levels were associated with both 
overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) only for bortezomib -containing 
therapy  leading to the possibilit y that hi gh-circulating protesom e levels coul d be both a poor 
prognosti c and also a specific marker of poor outcome with bortezomib. These data point to 
the potenti al value of further exploring the relat ionship between predose circulat ing 
proteasome levels and respon se to MLN9708. In this study , a bl ood sam ple will be collected 
at screening in order to test the levels o f circulat ing proteasome and its associat ion to 
MLN9708 efficacy .
1.4.4    Rationale for the Combination of MLN9708, Lenalidomide, and 
Dexamethasone in a Hi gh-Risk Patient Population 
The clinical outcome of relapsed myelo ma is highly variable and can be related to specific 
cytogeneti c subt ypes. Abnormalit ies such as t(11;14), t(6;14), and hy perdi ploidy are 
associ ated wi th neutral  or favorabl e prognosi s while t(4;14), t(14;16), delet ion(17p), and 
amplificat ion of 1q impart an unfavorable prognosis. [37] Recently Klein et al and Bahlis 
etal have described the outcome of these subt ypes in the context of patients with relapsed or 
refractory  MM treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Both del(17) and 
amplificat ion 1q21 were associated with significantly worse PFS and OS, and the median 
OS for the del(17) patients was only  6.7months.[38]Two recent reports showed that 
bortezo mib-based treatment improves outcome in patients with MM including patients with 
high-risk chro mosomal aberrati ons). [
39,40] Patients with del(17) had a notable benefit. The 
median PFS time was 26.2 months for the bortezomib arm versus 12 months for the standard 
arm (p = 0.024), while the 3
-year OS rate in this subt ype improved fro m 17% to 69% 
(p=0.028). After mult ivariate analysis, del(17) was an independent predictor for PFS 
(p<0.0001) and OS (p <0.0001) only in the bortezomib arm. In light of these observat ions, 
this study  will assess the outcome of pat ients with del(17) RRMM to determine if addit ion 
of MLN9708 to l enalido mide and dexamethasone improves PFS and OS.

434.  STUDY DESIGN 
MLN9708 capsules and placebo capsul es will  be subsequent ly referred to as study drug.
4.1   Overview of Study Design
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, m ulticenter study  to eval uate the safet y and 
efficacy  of MLN9708 versus placebo in pat ients wit h relapsed and/or ref ractory  MM who 
are treated with lenalido mide and dexamethasone as their standard therapy. The patient 
popul ation will consist of adult men and wo men who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, 
who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy , and who m eet other e ligibilit y criteria (see 
Secti on 5). Approximately  703 pati ents will be enrolled in the study . 
The fo llowing paragraphs describe the study  design before implementation of 
Amendment 8.
General eligibilit y criteria may  be asses sed pri or to the form al Screening peri od if it is 
part of standard clinical pract ice. However, per the Schedule ofEvents , formal screening 
willoccur during the Screening period, which may last for up to 28 day s prior to 
rando mizat ion. An MPI/designee clinician will confirm pat ient eligibilit y prior to 
rando mizat ion. Determinat ion of disease progression as an entry criterion may be based 
on pati ent data obtained during or following the patient’s most recent prior 
antineoplastic therapy.
Following the Screening period, patients who will be enrolled and treated with 
lenalido mide plus dexamethasone will be rando mized to receive a study  drug in a 
doub le-blind fashio n, either MLN9708 or pl acebo. Eligible patients will be rando mized 
in a 1:1 rati o into those 2 treatm ent arms, stratified by : 1 versus 2 or 3 pri or therapi es, 
proteasome -inhibitor exposed versus proteasome -inhibitor naïve, and ISS stage at 
screening of 1 or 2 versus stage 3.
Patients will  receive study  drug (MLN9708 4.0mg or m atching pl acebo capsul e) on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 plus lenalido mide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone 
(40 m g) on Day s 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28- day cycle. Pati ents may continue to receive 
treatm ent until PD or unacceptable toxicit y, whichever co mes first. Dose modificat ions 
may be made based on toxicit ies. Patients with a low creatinine clearance 60 m L/min 
(or 50 mL/min, according to local label/pract ice) will receive a reduced lenalido mide 
dose of 10 mg once daily on Days 1 through 21 of a 28- day cycle. The lenalidomide 
dose m ay be escalated to 15 mg once daily after 2 cy cles if the pati ent is not responding

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
44to treatment and is tolerat ing the treatment. If re nal funct ion norm alizes (i e, creatinine 
clearance > 60 mL/min or > 50mL/min, according to local label/practice) and the patient 
continues to tolerate this treatment, lenalido mide may then be escalated to 25 mg once 
daily .
Treatment periods will be defined as 28 -day cycles. Pati ents will  be seen at regular 
treatm ent cycle intervals while they  are parti cipat ing in the study : twice a treatm ent 
cycle for the first 3 cy cles, then once a treatment cycle for the remainder of their 
participat ion in the active trea tment and, if applicable, the PFS (every  4 weeks) and OS 
(every  12 weeks) follow -up phases of the study . As of Amendment 6, the primary  
endpo int has been met; as such, the PFS fo llow-up phase no longer applies to patients 
currently receiving study  therapy  or to any  patients who have discont inued treatment for 
reasons other than PD. However, all pat ients will continue to be fo llowed for survival.
Patients will  be assessed for disease response and progression by  an IRC. Response will 
be assessed according to the IMWG criteria for all patients every 4 weeks unt il disease 
progression. As of Amendment 6, however, because PFS fo llow-up is now com pleted 
for this study , for all  patients still receiving study  therapy, all  central  and invest igator 
assessments of respo nse and progression for protocol purposes will be discont inued —
IRC review will no longer be performed, and IRC response will no longer be assessed.
All patients will cont inue to be fo llowed for survival after progression or after 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent for reasons other than progression. Patients will be 
contacted every  12weeks unt il death or terminat ion of the study  by the sponsor.
Pain evaluat ion (using the BPI -SF) will include quant ified assessments of intensit y, 
frequency  and durati on, degree of disco mfort, locati on, and likely relationship to MM 
(versus prior therapy  or com orbidi ties). Time to pain progression will be based on pain 
assessments using the worst pain item on the BPI -SF rated on a scale from 0 to 10, 
collected as outlined in the Schedule ofEvents .
Health-related qualit y of life (QOL) will also be evaluated through patient self -reported 
instrum ents including the EORTC QLQ -C30, MY -20, and the EQ -5D generic healt h 
status measure. In addit ion to assessing selected symptoms, these instruments elucidate 
the effects of disease on physical, social, psycho logical/em otional, and cogni tive 
funct ioning.

45ECOG performance score, a dverse events (AEs), laboratory  values, and vital sign 
measurements will be collected and assessed to evaluate the safet y of therapy throughout 
the study . Toxicit y will be evaluated according to National Cancer Inst itute Commo n 
Termino logy Cri teria for Adver se Events (NCI CTCAE), versio n4.03, effective date 
14June 2010.
Unscheduled visits may  occur between treatm ent cycles as required. For example, 
symptom atic pain progressio n should result in an interim unscheduled visit, as would 
ongoing Grade 3 or worse AEs.
Patients will  attend an End of Treatment (EOT) visit approximately 30 days after 
receiving their last dose of study  drug and will continue to be followed for other follow-
up assessments specified in the Schedule ofEvents . Patients discont inuing study  drug 
prior to disease progression will continue to be assessed for disease progression during 
the PFS fo llow-up porti on of  the study . All patien ts will  now only  be followed f or 
survival after treatment termination or progression. Patients will be contacted every  12 
weeks unt il death or terminat ion of the study  by the sponsor.
The final analysis data cutoff has been conducted. Upon implementation o f Amendment 8,
the invest igator will unblind all pat ients rem aining on study  treatm ent and will fo llow the 
new Schedule of Events presented in this amendment. Only pat ients who continue to 
demonstrate clinical benefit but who do not have other means of access to the study  drugs 
will cont inue on the study. Because no further formal statist ical analyses will be performed, 
only assessments contribut ing to long -term safet y monitoring are required. Most study  
assessments besides safet y are discontinued to eas e the burden of protocol -mandated 
assessments on patients.
Patients continuing their current study  treatm ent may  do so until  such time as other m eans of 
accessing the study  drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should co mplete an EOT 
visit and transi tion onto an al ternative supply o f (eg, commercially  available) ixazo mib 
and/or LenDex, or onto another standard of care treatment. Discont inued patients will be 
treated by  their physician per local standard of care.
Patients who are receiving ixazomib plu s LenDex will cont inue to receive ixazo mib plus 
LenDex. Patients who are receiving placebo plus LenDex will receive LenDex only; the 
placebo capsule will no longer be administered and patients receiving placebo will not be 
crossed over to ixazo mib in this study . Upon im plementati on of  Amendment 8, data 
collect ion requirements will be limited to collect ion of AEs, SAEs, local laboratory

46assessments of safet y, physical examinat ions, and concomitant medicat ions. Qualit y of life, 
healt h care utilizat ion, EQ -5D,and pain assessments are discont inued. Survival data will no 
longer be co llected because the analysis of OS will be complete at the time of the final 
analysis. Other study  assessments are no longer required, as noted in the new Schedule o f 
Events. Patient s will not be fo llowed for the OS follow- up peri od because OS data are no 
longer being co llected.
Three interim analyses (IAs) have been planned during the study . The first will occur when 
approximately  262 patients have experienced disease progression or death. This is the first 
analysis for PFS and the first IA for OS. The second IA will occur when approximately 
365patients have experienced disease progression or death. This is the final analysis for PFS 
and the second IA for OS. If the test for PFS at t he second IA is not statist ically significant, 
the study  will be claimed as unsuccessful and no further testing will be conducted. If the test 
for PFS i s significant at either of the first two IAs, OS will be tested; however, the study  will 
not be stopped for OS efficacy or futilit y due to the predicted small number of death events 
at the first IA. 
As of Amendment 8, the 3 IAs have been performed. The primary analysis (data cutoff date, 
30 October 2014) occurred when 286 patients had experienced disease pr ogressi on or death; 
at this analysis, the primary endpo int of PFS was met. The next analysis (data cutoff date, 12 
July 2015) occurred when 372 patients had experienced disease progression or death. This 
was the first analysis for OS. A total of 171 deaths had been reported and the thresho ld for 
OS statistical significance was not met .Per the study design and statist ical analysis plan, the 
study  was to conti nue, fo llowing patients for survival. The third IA (data cutoff date, 25 
October 2017) occurred when 333 deaths had been reported. The thresho ld for stati stical 
significance was not m et and the study  was to continue to the final analysis. The final 
analysis occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
An independent data monitoring co mmittee (IDMC) will revi ew safet y and efficacy  data at
the IAs. See Section 9.3for more inform ation. 
4.2   Number of Patients
Approximately  703 pati ents will be enrolled in this study  from approximately  150 study  
centers globally .

474.3   Duration of Study
Patients will  be followed up unt il 486 deaths have been reported. The duration of the study 
will be approximately  80months (6 y ears 8 m onths), including 20 months for enrollment 
and 60 m onths fo llow-up from the l ast pati ent enrolled.
Patients m ay remain on treatm ent until the occurrence o f PDor unacceptable toxicit y. 
Delayed treatm ent-related AEs will be fo llowed for 30 day s after l ast dose of study  drug. 
Patients who stop treatment for any reason other than disease progression will cont inue in 
PFS follow-up and be seen every  4weeks until documented disease progression. After 
disease progressi on all  patients will continue to the overall survival fo llow-up phase and be 
contacted every  12weeks. 
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, only pat ients who conti nue to dem onstrate clinical 
benefit but who do not have other means of access to the study  drugs will cont inue on the 
study . Pati ents continuing their current study  treat ment may  do so until such t ime as other 
means of accessing the study  drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should complete 
an End of Treatment (EOT) visit and transit ion onto an alternat ive supply o f (eg, 
commercially  available) ixazo mib and/or LenDex, or onto another standard of care 
treatm ent. Di scont inued pat ients will be treated by  their physician per local standard of care.

MLN9708 act ive capsules will be supplied as single capsules at 3 different dose strengths, 
containing 4.0, 3.0 ,and 2.3 mg of MLN9708. Placebo capsules will be identical in shape, 
size, and color to the MLN9708 active capsules. Bo th the active and placebo capsules will 
be provided by  the sponsor. 
The final analysis data cutoff has been conducted and as such, the study  is considered 
complete for stati stical analysis purposes. Upon implementation of Amendment 8, the 
investigator wil l unblind all patients remaining on study  treatm ent Patients continuing their 
current study  treatm ent m ay do so until such time as other means of accessing the study  
drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should complete an EOT visit and transit ion 
onto an alternat ive supply o f (eg, commercially availa ble) ixazo mib and/or LenDex, or onto 
another standard of care treatment. Discontinued patients will be treated by  their physician 
per local standard of care. Patients who are receiving ixazomib plus LenDex will cont inue to 
receive ixazo mib plus LenDex.  Pa tients who are receiving placebo plus LenDex will

54receive LenDex only; the placebo capsule will no longer be administered and patients 
receiving placebo will not be crossed over to ixazomib in this study .
Study  drug will be given as a single, oral dose of 4.0mg weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15) for 
3weeks, fo llowed by  1week wi thout s tudy drug in a 28 -day cycle. Pati ents shoul d be 
instructed to swallow MLN9708/placebo capsules who le wit h water and not to break, chew, 
or open the capsules. Study  drug shoul d be ta ken on an empt y stom ach, at l east 1 hour 
before or no sooner than 2 hours after food. The capsule should be swallowed wit h a sip of 
water. A total of approximately 240 mL of water should be taken with the capsules. 
Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers as lo ng as the next scheduled 
dose i s 72 hours or m ore away . A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed 
dose. If the patient vomit s after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but 
shoul d resume dosing at th e time of the next scheduled dose.
6.2   Standard of Care Therapies
6.2.1    Lenalidomide Administration
Lenalido mide will be given as a single, daily  oral dose of 25 m g for a total  of 21 day s out of 
a 28-day cycle. Pati ents wi th a low creatinine clearance 60 m L/min (or 50 mL/min, 
according to local label/practice) will receive a reduced lenalido mide dose of 10 mg once 
daily  on Days 1 through 21 of a 28 -day cycle. The lenalidomide dose may be escalated to 
15mg once daily after 2 cy cles if the pat ient is not r esponding to treatment and is tolerat ing 
the treatment. If renal funct ion norm alizes (i e, creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min or 
> 50 mL/min, according to local label/practice) and the patient continues to tolerate this 
treatm ent, l enalido mide may then be esc alated to 25 mg once daily .
Administrati on of  lenalido mide will be at approximately the same time each day. Patients 
shoul d be instructed to swallow lenalidomide capsules whole wit h or without food and not 
to break, chew, or open the capsules. 
If a dose o f lenalido mide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. 
If it is missed for the ent ire day , it shoul d not be made up.
Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed to 
seek emergency  medical c are if needed and contact study  staff immediately.

556.2.2    Dexamethasone Administration
Dexamethasone will be given as an oral dose of 40 mg/day weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 
of a 28 -day cycle.
Dexamethasone should be taken at approximately the same t ime pr eferably  with food/milk 
to avoid stomach irritation. If a dose of dexamethasone is missed, the dose should be taken 
as soon as the patient remembers it. If enough time has elapsed that it is almost time for the 
next dose (within 6 hours), the missed dose s hould be skipped and the next dose taken 
according to the regular dosing schedule. A double dose should not be taken to make up for 
a missed dose. If the patient vomit s after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose 
but shoul d resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.
6.3   Dose- Modification Guidelines
The patient will be evaluated for possible toxicit ies that may have occurred after the 
previous dose(s) according to the Schedule ofEvents. Toxi cities are to be assessed 
according to the NCI Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 
4.03. Each adverse event should be attributed to a specific drug, if possi ble, so that the dose 
modificati ons can be made accordingly . Only  1 dose adj ustment per cy cle will be performed 
for a given agent when toxicit y is suspected to be related primarily to that agent. Reduction 
of 1 agent and not the other is appropriate if the toxici ty is suspected to be related primarily  
to 1 of the agents. Dose reduction of mult iple agents may be considered after consultat ion 
with the Millennium clinician/study  clinician designee. Guidelines for dose modificat ion 
within cycles are provided in Sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2. Pri or to beginning the next cy cle of  
treatm ent, refer to the guidelines in Sect ion
 6.5. 
Further cl arificat ion can be obtained in consultat ion with the Millennium clinician/study  
clinician designee. If mult iple toxicit ies are noted, the dose adjust ments and/or delays should 
be made according to the most severe toxicit y guidelines. 
Alternat ive dose modificat ions may be recommended after discussio n with the invest igator 
and MPI clinician/designee in order to maximize exposure of study  treatm ent while 
protecting patient safet y.

Drug and Lenalidomide
A decisio n regarding which study  drug requi res dose reducti on will be dependent upon the 
toxicity, its onset, and time course. Alternat ive dose modificat ions m ay be recommended 
after di scussio n with the invest igator and Millennium clinician/study  clinician designee to 
maximize exposure of study  treatm ent while protecting patient safet y given that there may 
be overlapping dose limit ing toxicit ies (eg, thrombocy topeni a, neutropeni a, rash, and

686.10   Management of Clinical Events 
Prophylaxis Against Risk of Reactivation of Herpes Infection
Patients m aybe at an increased risk of infect ion including reactivation o f herpes zoster and 
herpes simplex viruses. Unless there is a clinical contraindicat ion, prophylactic ant iviral 
therapy  is requi red for allpatientswhile receiving study  treatm ent. Examples of acceptable 
antiviral therapy  include acycl ovir (eg, 400 m g given orally, 3 times a day ), famcicl ovir (eg, 
125 mg given orally, twi ce a day ), or valacycl ovir (eg, 500 m g given orally , twice a day ) or 
standard of care/local pract ice.
Thromboembolism Prophyla xis
While on lenalido mide, patients should be on routine thromboprophylaxis. [45]Prophylact ic 
therapy  with aspirin (81 -325 m g PO once daily ) or LMWH (equivalent to enoxaparin 
40mg subcutaneous [SQ] per day ) per published standard or inst itutional standard of care is 
requi red for all  patients to prevent thromboembo lic complicat ions that may occur with 
lenalido mide ‑based regimens in co mbination wit h dexamethasone. Thromboprophylaxis 
according to the American Societ y of Clinical  Oncology (ASCO) gui delines or inst itutional 
standard of care is recommended. [46]
Nausea and/or Vomiti ng
Prophylaxis wit h standard ant iemetics, including serotonin 5 -hydroxy tryptamine 3 receptor 
antagonists , is recommended for emesis. Any fluid deficit occurring during treatment should 
be prompt ly corrected.
Diarrhea
Diarrhea shoul d be managed according to clinical practice, including the administration of 
antidiarrheals once infect ious causes are excluded. Fluid intake should be maintained to 
avoid dehydration. Any fluid deficit occurring during treatment should be prompt ly 
corrected.
Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus
Rash has been reported with both lenalido mide and MLN9708. The lenalido mide induced 
rash is characterized as generalized, maculopapular, morbilliform, urticarial, papular, often 
with pruri tus, and is noted as a warning/precaution in the lenalido mide package 
insert. [43,47,48] Serious skin react ions such as Stevens -Johnson Syndro me, toxic epidermal
necro lysis, and erythema mult iforme have been reported. Lenalido mide interruption or

69discontinuat ion shoul d be considered as described in the package insert (PI)/ summary  of 
product characteristics (SmPC). [43]
Rash may  range from  limited erythematous areas, macular or small papular bumps that may 
or may not be pruri tic over a few areas of the body, to a more generalized eruption that is 
predominant ly on the trunk or extremit ies. Rash has been most commonly characterized as 
maculopapular or macular. To date, when it does occur, rash is most commonly reported 
within the first 3 cy cles of therapy . The rash is often transient and self -limit ing and i s 
typically  Grade 1 or 2 in severit y. As in many other oncology  trials, rash may  occur in 
patients receiving placebo and in patients receiving MLN9708. If rash occurs, considerat ion 
shoul d be given to al ternate causes of the rash such as concomitant medications, infections, 
etc; these other causative agents should be discont inued and alterative agents considered if 
medically necessary
.
Symptom atic m easures such as ant ihistamines or corticosteroids (oral or topical) have been 
successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylactically  in subsequent cy cles. 
The use of a topical , IV, or oral  steroid (eg, prednisone 10 m g per day  or equivalent [see 
Secti on 15.5]) is permitted. 
Management of a Grade 3 rash may require IV ant ihistamines or corticosteroids. 
Administrati on of  MLN9708 (and/or other causative agent if given in combinat ion) shoul d 
be modified per protocol and re- initiated at a reduced level fro m where rash was noted (also, 
per protocol). In line with clinical pract ice, dermatolog y consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or 
higher rash or any  SAE involving rash is recommended. Prophylact ic measures should also 
be considered if a patient has previously developed a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol -free 
emollient cream on dry  areas of the body  or oral  or topi cal antihistamines). 
The rare risks of Stevens -Johnson syndro me, toxic epidermal necro lysis, drug reaction with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), and pemphigus vulgaris have 
been reported in oncology  studi es when MLN9708 (or placebo) was given wit h concomita nt 
medicat ions that are known to cause rash (eg, Bactrim, lenalido mide, aspirin), and/or in the 
setting of confounding TEAEs. These severe, potent ially life-threatening or deadly 
condi tions may  involve rash with skin peeling and mouth sores and should be c linically  
managed according to standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological 
analysis are encouraged at the discretion of the investigator. Study  medicati ons shoul d be 
discontinued in the event of severe, potentially life -threatening rash . Addit ional informat ion 
regarding these reactions can be found in the IB.

70Thrombocytopenia
Blood counts shoul d be m onitored regul arly as outlined in theprotocol ,with addi tional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Thrombocy topenia m ay be severe 
but has been manageable with platelet transfusions according to standard clinical pract ice. 
Lenalido mide or study  drug administration should be modified as per dose modificat ion 
recommendat ions in theprotocol  when thrombocy topeni a occurs (see Table 6-1). Therapy  
can be reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of platelet counts. Thrombotic 
microangiopathy  (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocy topeni a purpura and hemo lytic 
uremic syndrome, are rare, serious blood disorders that cause low levels o f platelets and red 
blood cells and result in blood c lots in small blood vessels. Symptoms may include fat igue, 
fever, bruising, nose bleeds, and decreased urinat ion. These disorders, including fatal cases, 
have been reported in patients receiving MLN9708. If TMA is suspected, consider 
withdrawal  of the suspected causat ive agent and manage according to standard medical 
practi ce. 
Neutropenia
Blood counts shoul d be m onitored regul arly as outlined in theprotocol  with addi tional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Neutrop enia may be severe but has 
been manageable. Growth factor support is not required but may be considered according to 
standard clinical pract ice. Lenalido mide or study drug administration should be modified as 
noted as per dose modificat ion recommendat ions in theprotocol when neutropeni a occurs 
(see Table 6-2). Therapy  can be reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of absolute 
neutrophil counts .
Fluid Deficit
Dehydr ation shoul d be avo ided since lenalido mide is substant iallyexcreted by  kidney , and 
MLN9708 may  cause vomi ting, di arrhea ,and dehydrati on. Acute renal failure has been 
reported in patients treated with MLN9708, commonly in the setting of the previously not ed 
gastrointestinal toxicit ies and dehydration. Fluid deficit should be prom ptlycorrected before 
initiation of study drug and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydration (see 
Secti on6.8).
Hypotension
Symptom atic hypotensio n and orthostatic hypotension wit h or without syncope have been 
reported with MLN9708. Blood pressure should be closely monitored as per standard of care

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
71while the patient is on study  treatm ent and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, 
especially  in the setting of concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomit ing, di arrhea, or 
decreased appet ite. Pati ents taking m edicat ions and/or diuret ics to manage thei r blood 
pressure (for either hypo -or hy pertensio n) shoul d be managed according to standard clinical 
practi ce, including considerat ions for dose adj ustments of their conco mitant m edicat ions 
during the course of the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of study  drug 
and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydrat ion.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported with MLN9708. 
This condit ion is usually transient and re versible. Itis characterized by headache, seizures, 
and visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed by 
magnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) or com puted tom ography  (CT) . If the syndro me is 
diagnosed or suspected, sympt om-directed treatm ent shoul d be maintained unt il the 
condi tion is reversed by  control  of hypertensio n or other inst igating factors. 
Transverse Myelitis
Transverse myelit is has been reported with MLN9708. It is not known whether MLN9708 
causes transverse m yelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving MLN9708, 
the possibilit y that MLN9708 may  have contributed to transverse myelit is cannot be 
excluded. Transverse myelit is should be managed according to standard medical practice.
Overdose
An ove rdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by  a study  subject, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual 
subject according to the study  protocol . If overdose occurs, consider close obs ervati on 
including hospitalizat ion for hem odynamic support. Gastric lavage may  be consi dered if 
instituted wi thin 1 hour of ingest ion of MLN9708 overdose.
6.11   Blinding and Unblinding
To m aintain the blind, all study  personnel including the investigators, s ite personnel, study  
clinicians, and the sponsor will be blinded to the treatment assignments for the duration of 
the study .
Kit assignments will be obtained through the interactive voice response system (IVRS) 
according to the procedures outlines in the Study  Manual. Information regarding the kit

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
72assignments will be kept securely at Millennium or designee, per its standard oper ating 
procedures. Emergency unblinding, if necessary , will  be conducted via the IVRS.
Records of the patient number, the date study  drug was di spensed, and the kit assignment 
will be maintained by  the study  site. If  the treatm ent assi gnment m ust be reveale d for the 
safet y of the pati ent or to treat an AE, the invest igator will contact the Millennium clinician/ 
study  clinician designee (contact information is in the Study  Manual ). A decisio n to break 
the blind must be reached by the Millennium clinician/stud y clinician designee and the 
investigator. The invest igator, or designee, may break the blind through the IVRS 
independent of the Millennium clinician/ study  clinician designee only  if it is considered to 
be an emergency  by the invest igator that requires s pecific knowledge of the blinded study  
treatm ent in order to properly treat the AE/safet y issue. If the treatment of the AE/ safet y 
issue is the same regardless of the study  drug assignment, the blind should not be broken. 
The event requiring breaking the blind must be documented in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF), including the date the blind was broken. In addit ion, the pati ent will be 
discontinued fro m further study  drug administrati on in this study .
The final analysis data cutoff has been conduct ed and as such, the study  is considered 
complete for stati stical analysis purposes. Upon implementation of Amendment 8, the 
investigator will unblind all patients remaining on study  treatm ent and will fo llow the new 
Schedule of Events presented in this ame ndment. Only patients who continue to demonstrate 
clinical benefit but who do not have other means of access to the study  drugs will cont inue 
on the study . Pati ents continuing their current study  treatm ent m ay do so until  such time as 
other m eans of access ing the study  drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should 
complete an EOT vi sit and transi tion onto an al ternat ive supply o f (eg, commercially 
available) ixazo mib and/or LenDex, or onto another standard of care treatment. 
Discontinued pati ents will  be treated by  their physici an per l ocal standard of care. Patients 
who are receiving ixazo mib plus LenDex will continue to receive ixazo mib plus LenDex.  
Patients who are receiving placebo plus LenDex will receive LenDex only; the placebo 
capsule will no l onger be administered and patients receiving placebo will not be crossed 
over to ixazo mib in this study .
6.12   Description of Investigational Agents
MLN9708 and matching placebo capsules are manufactured by  Millennium . The MLN9708 
drug product is provided in strengths of 4.0 -, 3.0-,and 2.3- mg capsules as the active boronic

For addi tional details, pl ease see the MLN9708 IB and Pharmacy  Manual .
6.13   Preparation, Reconstitution, and Dispensing
For blistered material, the capsules are packaged in co ld form foil-foil blisters in a 
child -resistant carton.
6.14   Packaging and Labeli ng
The MLN9708 capsules and placebo capsules will be provided by Millennium. The study  
drug l abels will fulfill all requirements specified by  governing regulati ons. The form ulation 
consists of 4.0- , 3.0-, and 2.3- mg capsules for oral administration. 
The c apsules are individually packaged using co ld form fo il-foil blisters that are in a 
child -resistant carton. There are 3 capsules in each wallet/carton. 
6.15   Storage, Handling, and Accountability
On receipt at the invest igative site, study drug should remain in the blister pack and carton 
provi ded unt il use or dispensat ion. All excursio ns that occur at the site storage or during 
transportation from depot to the site shoul d immediately be brought to the sponsor’s 
attenti on for assessment and authorization for continued use. Ensure that the drug is used 
before the retest expiry date provided by  Millennium . Expiry  extensions will  be 
communicated accordingly  with updated documentati on to support the extended shelf life.
Study  drug dispensed to the patient should r emain in the blister packaging and carton until 
the poi nt of use. Refer to the Pharmacy  Manual or equivalent storage guidelines. In case of 
extenuat ing circumstances that prevent a patient from attending the study  site (eg, the 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
74COVID -19 pandemic), sites ma y use al ternat ive strategies to deliver study drug to patients 
(eg, vi a couri er or si te staff), per local standard practice and regulat ions and wit h prior 
approval  from the invest igator and the sponsor’s project clinician/designee. Com prehensive 
instructi ons should be provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance with, and 
understanding of, dosing procedures. Patients who are receiving take -home medicat ion 
ordinarily should be given only  1 cycle of study  drug at a time; more than 1 cycle of 
medicat ion may  be dispensed on a case -by-case basis for holidays, travel, or other 
circumstances upon discussion wit h the invest igator and sponsor project clinician/designee. 
(Note: patients in France are only  permi tted to receive 1 cy cle of  medicat ion at a time).
Shoul d more than 1 cycle of medicat ion be dispensed, the invest igator and/or healt h care 
provi der m ust revi ew the proper dosing instructions with the patient to avoid the potential 
for incorrect self -administrati on or overdose of medicat ion. 
Patients sho uld be instructed to store the medicat ion according to the storage condit ions that 
are outlined in the Pharmacy  Manual  or equivalent storage guidelines. Patients should be 
instructed to return their empt y cartons to the investigat ive site, rather than disc arding them . 
Reconciliat ion will occur accordingly when the patient returns for their next cycle of study  
drug. In case of extenuat ing circumstances that prevent a patient fro m attending the study  
site (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), drug packs and dosing dia ries shoul d be returned at the 
next available on -site clinic visi t. Any extreme in temperature should be reported as an 
excursio n and shoul d be deal t with on a case -by-case basis. 
Because MLN9708 is an ant icancer agent, as with other potentially toxic co mpounds, 
cauti on shoul d be exercised when handling the study  drug. Pati ents shoul d be instructed not 
to chew, break, or open capsules. In case of contact with broken capsules, raising dust 
shoul d be avoi ded during the clean -up operati on. The product m ay be harmful by  inhalat ion, 
ingestion, or skin absorption. Gloves and protective clothing should be worn during clean -up 
and during return of broken capsules and powder to minimize skin contract. The area should 
be ventilated and the site washed wit h soap and w ater after material pick up is co mplete. The 
materi al should be disposed of as hazardous medical waste in compliance with federal, state, 
and local regulat ions. 
In case of contact with the powder (eg, from a broken capsule), skin should be washed 
immediat ely wit h soap and copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. In case of 
contact wi th the ey es, copi ous am ounts of water should be used to flush the ey es for at l east 
15 minutes. Medical personnel should be notified.

767.   STUDY CONDUCT
This tri al will be conducted in com pliance wi th the protocol , good clinical pract ice (GCP), 
applicable regulatory  requi rements, and Internat ional Conference on Harmonisat ion (ICH) 
guidelines.
7.1   Study Personnel and Organizations
The contact in formation for the Millennium clinician/study clinician designee, the central 
laboratory , any  addi tional clinical  laboratori es or vendors parti cipating on the study  may be 
found in the Study  Manual. A full list of invest igators is available in the sponsor’s
investigator database.
7.2   Arrangements for Recruitment of Patients
Recrui tment and enro llment strategies for this study may include central recruit ment from a 
vendor, recruit ment from the invest igator’s local practice, or referrals from other physicians.
If advert isements become part of the recruitment strategy, they will be reviewed by the 
institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC). It is not envisioned 
that pri soners (or other populat ions that might be subject to coercion or exp loitation) will be 
enrolled into this study .
7.3   Treatment Group Assignments 
After wri tten inform ed consent has been obtained, the patient will be assigned an enrollment 
code (country -, site-, and pati ent-specific) using IVRS.
Patient eligibilit y will be confirmed by an MPI/designee clinician before randomization by  
the invest igator into the study, as patients will not be permitted to re-enroll. A centralized 
rando mizat ion using IVRS will be used. Patients will be rando mized strictly sequent ially at 
a cent er as they  become eligible for randomizat ion. If a pati ent di scontinues from  the study , 
that randomizat ion code will not be reused, and the patient will not be allowed to re -enter 
the study .

777.4   Study Procedures
In acknowl edgement of hospital, local, state or national government restrict ions, or other 
site-related factors caused by  unavoi dable circumstances (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic) that 
may prevent invest igators from conduct ing the study according to the Schedule of Events at 
the clinical study  site, inv estigators may cont inue patients in the study  despi te departure 
from the Schedule o f Events. Invest igators are expected to evaluate the impact to the safet y 
of the study  parti cipants and site personnel for patients to con tinue. In evaluat ing such 
requests, the invest igator/study  site staff will give the highest priorit y to the safet y and 
welfare of the patients. Patients must be willing and able to continue taking study  
medicat ion and rem ain com pliant wi th the protocol.  For patients that are impacted by th ese 
unavo idable circumstances, any procedures not conducted per the study protocol will be 
docum ented in the eCRF.  
Alternat ive methods shoul d be considered for performing the assessments by  other m eans 
than the patient present ing to the clinic (eg, remote assessment, having lab assessment 
perform ed at a facilit y closer to the pati ent’s ho me, etc.) If a patient misses a n in-person 
study  visit, the invest igator/study  team  staff will speak di rectly wit h the patient by  telephone 
or other medium (eg, a computer -based video communicat ion) during each visit window to 
assess subject safet y and overall clinical status. During th is contact with the patient, the 
study  site physician or other qualified site staff should at minimum conduct AE collect ion 
and an assessment of clinical symptoms. Other study  assessments may  be collected remotely 
as is feasible and may  involve audio or vi deo recording. Assessments/procedures that cannot 
be co mpleted during the protocol -specified window because a site visit is done remotely  (eg, 
complete physical examinat ion, symptom -directed physical  examinat ion, hematology , 
clinical chemistry , concomitant medications/procedures) are waived. 
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, patients continuing to derive clinical benefit will be 
evaluated for safet y only during the treatment period and at EOT. T he primary endpo int has 
been met and all other formal statis tical analyses will be com plete at the time of the final 
analysis . As such, the PFS and OS follow- up phases are di scont inued for patients currently 
receiving study  therapy . Pati ents in the OS fo llow-up phase will be discont inued.

shoul d be perform ed on schedule, but occasional changes are allowable (± 7 day s) for 
holidays, vacat ions, and other administrative reasons. If the study  schedule is shifted, 
assessments must be shifted to ensure that collect ion of assessments is co mpleted before 
dosing.
Addit ional details are provided as necessary  in the sect ions th at follow.
7.4.1    Informed Consent
Each patient must provide written informed consent before any  study -requi red procedures 
are conducted, unless those procedures are performed as part of the patient’s standard care.
Patients rem aining on study  treatm ent will need to be reconsented. Reconsent ing should be 
done in person. Remote reconsent ing is permitted as long as the process adheres to site, 
IRB/IEC, and GCP standards and local regulat ions.
7.4.2    Patient Demographics
The date of birth, race, ethnicit y, and sex o f the patient are to be recorded during screening. 
7.4.3    Medical History
During the Screening period, a complete medical history  will be com piled for each pat ient, 
including diagnosis (Section 15.2) and current staging (Section 15.4) of MM. The history  
shoul d include a review of all current medi cations, pri or radi ation or antineoplast ic therapy, 
and the patient’s current smoking status. 
7.4.4    Physical Examination
A co mplete physical examinat ion and symptom -directed phy sical exam will be conducted at 
the time po ints specified in the Schedule ofEvents . Symptom -directed examinat ions should 
include examinat ion of organ systems related to patient symptoms to document potential 
AEs, AE severit y, and AE resolut ion. 
7.4.5    Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status
Perform ance status will be assessed using the ECOG performance scale (see Section 15.1) at 
the time po ints specified in the Schedules of Events in Section
 15.12 and Section 15.13 .
 
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, ECOG performance status will no longer be

7.4.7    Pregnancy Test
Two pregnancy tests with sensit ivity of at least 25 mIU/mL will be performed for all wo men 
of childbearing potential prior to init iation of study drug treatment. The first pregnancy test 
must be performed within 10 to 14 da ys prior to the start of study drug and the second 
pregnancy test must be performed wit hin 24 hours prior to the start of study  drug, and as 
requi red by the l enalido mide package insert. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a
sexually  mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy  or bilateral  
oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally  postm enopausal  (amenorrhea following cancer 
therapy  does not rul e out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive mo nths (ie, has 
had menses at any  time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).
FCBP wit h regular or no menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly for the first 
28days and then every  28 days while on treatm ent (including breaks in therapy ), at 
discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent, and at D ay 28 after the last dose of study drug. Females 
with irregular m enstruati on m ust have a pregnancy test weekly  for the first 28 days and then 
every 14 days while on study  (including breaks in therapy), at discont inuation o f treatm ent, 
and at Day s 14 and 28 after the l ast dose of treatment. All patients must be counseled about 
pregnancy precaut ions, ri sks of fetal  exposure, and other risks in accordance with the 
RevAssist program (US participants), RevAid program (Canadian participants), iAccess 
program (Aus tralian parti cipants), RevMate program (Japanese participants), or The 
Lenalido mide Pregnancy Risk Minimisat ion Plan as outlined in the Study  Manual (all other 
participants who are not using commercial supplies).
The Cycle 1, Day  1 pregnancy  test m ay be co llected up to 24 hours before dosing. The 
resul ts must be available and negat ive before the first dose of study  drug i s administered.
Pregnancy tests may also be repeated during the study  as per request of IEC/IRBs or if 
requi red by l ocal regulat ions.

A 12 -lead ECG will be conducted at screening and at the times outlined in the Schedules o f 
Events in Sect ion 15.12 and Section 15.13. It may be repeated as clinically  indicated during 
the study  at the discret ion of the invest igator. ECG d ata to be obtained include PR interval, 
QRS interval, QT interval, QTc interval, and waveforms.
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, ECG data will no longer be co llected.
7.4.9    Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Clinical laboratory  evaluat ions will be performed by a central  laboratory . For dosing 
decisio ns, local hematol ogy and chemistry  laboratory  resul ts may be used; however, samples 
must still be sent to central labs as well. Hematology  and chemistry  panels may be collected 
up to 3 day s before Day  1 dosing and 24 hours before Day s 8, 15 and 22 dosing, where 
requi red. Per Am endment 6, c entralized clinical laboratory  evaluat ions of safet y will be 
perform ed only  on Day  1 of every  cycle. For dosing decisio ns and for all other safet y 
assessments for the patient, loc al hematol ogy and chemistry  laboratory  resul ts may  be used; 
however, samples must still be sent to central labs also. Local laboratory  evaluat ions may be 
done m ore frequently at the investigator’s discret ion, ie for acute m anagement of TEAEs. In 
general, l ocal laboratory  resul ts of safet y will not need to be entered into the eCRF. Local 
laboratory  evaluat ions should be entered into the eCRF only if required to document an AE, 
dose m odificat ion, or other event, and the informatio n entered should be limited t o that 
requi red to understand the event (eg, for a dose hold for thrombocy topeni a, enter the pl atelet 
count only). Handling and shipment of central clinical laboratory  samples are outlined in the 
Study  Manual.
As the centralized laboratory  resul ts may not be available at the init iation o f the next cycle, 
it is not required that these centralized measurements be reviewed before init iating the next 
treatm ent cycle unless eit her of the fo llowing applies:
1.The patient has an ongoing toxicit y. If the pati ent has had a toxicit y result ing in a 
dose hol d, it is m andatory  that safet y labs (local or central) are collected AND 
reviewed before starting the next cy cle of treatment.
2.It is requi red per y our local pract ice or guidelines to have safet y labs reviewed before 
starting the next cy cle of treatment.

During the treatment and the fo llow-up peri ods indicated in the Schedules o f Events in 
Secti on 15.12 and Section 15.13, all medical care encounters since the previous collection 
will be co llected from all pat ients, regardless of the reason for the medical care encounter. 
Examples of data to be collected are number and duration of medical care encounters, such 
as inpat ient/outpati ent admissio ns, homeca re, and time of work loss.
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, health utilizat ion data will no longer be co llected.
7.4.12    Quality of Life Assessment (European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer)
The QOL assessments (EORTC -QLQ -C30 and MY- 20; se e Secti ons 15.9 and 15.10 ) will be 
completed by  the pat ient as specified in the Schedules of Events in Section 15.12 and 
Secti on 15.13. The EORTC QLQ -30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical funct ioning, 
role functioning, em otional functioning, cognitive funct ioning, and social funct ioning), 1 
global heal th status scal e, 3symptom  scales (fat igue, nausea and vo miting, and pain), and 6 
single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appet ite loss, consti pation, diarrhea, and financial 
difficult ies). The time recall period for this instrument is 1 week (the week immediately  
preceding the assessment). 
The MY
-20 m ultiple myel oma module (20 -items) has 4 independent subscales, 2 functional 
subscales (body  image, future perspective), and 2 symptoms scales (disease symptoms and 
side-effects of treatment). This wi ll be administered subsequent to the EORTC QLQ- C30.
These are reliable and valid measures of healt h-related QOL in patients with cancer and 
takes about 15 minutes to administer. The instruments consist of a total of 50 items and have 
been validated and use d in many  countri es. 
These QOL assessments must be completed before other assessments are performed or study  
drug i s administered.

7.4.13    Pain Assessment
Pain assessments will be performed at study  visits as described in the Schedules of Events in 
Secti on 15.12 and Section 15.13 to collect the pain severit y, locati on, and interference 
inform ation with a 24 -hour recall period. This must be completed prior to other assessments 
or study  drug being administered. 
Patients who experience new or worsening pain between scheduled visit s shoul d be seen at 
an unscheduled visit, if necessary , or when the next scheduled visit is more than 4 weeks in 
the future. At the unscheduled visits, pain assessments should be co mpleted and appropriate 
management inst ituted. In addit ion, pati ents who report new or worsening pain at either a 
regul arly scheduled visit or are seen for pain at an unscheduled visit should have a follow -up
visit 3 to 5 weeks later for confirmat ion of the pain progression and for appropriate pain 
management. 
The Bri ef Pain Inventory -Short F orm (BPI -SF) will be the principal pain assessment tool for 
this study . The BPI -SF contains 15 items designed to captur e the pain severit y (“worst,” 
“least,” “average,” and “now” [current pain]), pain locat ion, medicat ion to relieve the pain, 
and the interference of pain wit h vari ous daily act ivities including general act ivity, mood, 
walking act ivity, norm al work, rel ations with other peopl e, sleep, and enjoyment of life.
The quest ionnaire emplo ys a 24 -hour recall period. The pain severit y items are rated on a 
0to 10 scal e, wi th 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as y ou can imagine. The PRO secondary  
endpo int will be “pain r esponse rate” as measured by  the worst pain i tem (Item  3) in the 
BPI-SF or analgesic use. The use of the single item, worst pain, is supported by  the Ini tiative 
on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) 
recommendat ions for assessing pain in clinical trials and by the European Medicines 
Agency 2003 Guidance on Clinical Invest igation of Medicinal Products for Nocicept ive 
Pain issued by  the Commi ttee f or Proprietary  Medicinal Products. In addit ion, the newly 
released FDA Guidanc e uses the following example while discussing conceptual 
frameworks: “The conceptual framework of a PRO instrument may be straight forward if a 
single item is a reliable and valid measure of the concept of interest (eg, pain intensit y).”  
At the time of ea ch pain assessment including unscheduled visits, the patient will be queried 
regarding concomitant use of analgesics, if any , as specified in the Schedule ofEvents . The

recorded on both the 24 hour analgesic form and concomitant medicat ion eCRFs.
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, pain assessments will n o longer be collected.
7.4.14    Utility Measurement
Because oncology  therapies may  posi tively or negatively affect a subject’s QOL, a commo n 
methodol ogic approach i s used to quantify this effect by  “qualit y-adjust ing” survival in 
comparat ive treatment groups. T he result, qualit y-adjusted life years (QALYs), i s a m easure 
of both the l ength and qualit y of life and is used as a measure of benefit in cost utilit y 
analysis. General PRO instruments such as the EORTC QLQ -C30 are not specifically 
designed to m easure sub ject preferences (or utilit ies) in a way that is suitable for calculat ing 
QALYs. Therefore, a separate validated instrument, in this case the EuroQoL EQ -5D, will 
be used to quantify  utilities to calculate QALYs for a cost utilit y analysis
The EQ -5D consist s of 2 pages: the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue 
scale (EQ VAS). The descript ive system co mprises 5 dimensio ns (mobilit y, self care, usual  
activit ies, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on). The EQ VAS records the respondent’s 
self-rated health on a 20- cm vertical, visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (worst 
imaginable healt h state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The EQ- 5D will be 
administered as specified in the Schedules o f Events in Section 15.12 and Section 15.13.
Upon i mplementation o f Amendment 8, EQ -5D data will no longer be collected.
7.4.15    Skeletal Survey
A co mplete skeletal survey, using roentgenography, will be performed at screening (within 
8 weeks of the first dose of study  drug) and annually  in all patients, as specified in the 
Schedule of Events in Sect ion 15.12. If at any  time the physician believes there are 
symptoms or signs that suggest increased or new bone lesio ns, a repeat of the skeletal survey 
shoul d be perform ed. For imaging o f symptom atic sites, pl ainfilms may  be obtained for 
additional clarity.
At the di screti on of  the invest igator and where regionally permitted,  CT scan, a positron 
emissio n tom ography -computed tomography (PET -CT) scan, or whole body  magnet ic 
resonance imaging (MRI) may be done at s creening in place of a skeletal survey, provided 
that the same modalit y for assessment i s used throughout the study .

have beenreported to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee. This 
include ddeath s that the invest igator consider edrelated to study  drug that occur redduring 
the posttreatment fo llow-up. In addi tion, new primary  malignancies that occur redduring the 
follow-up periods, irrespect ive of causalit y to study  regimen, m ust have beenreported to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee.
Refer to Section 10for details regarding definit ions, docum entati on, and reporti ngof SAEs.
7.5   Unscheduled Visits
Unscheduled visits may  occur between treatm ent cycles as required. At unscheduled visits 
prior to implementation of Amendment 8, the BPI -SF and HU data should be captured. 
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, pain assessments and HU data will no longer be 
collected. Other assessments may  be perf ormed as clinically indicated at the discret ion of 
the invest igator. 
7.6   Study Compliance
Study  drug will be administered or dispensed only  to eligible pat ients under the supervisio n 
of the invest igator or ident ified subinvest igator(s). The appropriate study  personnel will 
maintain records of study  drug receipt and dispensing.
7.7   Completion of Treatment
Prior to implementati on of  Amendment 8, patients were considered to have co mpleted study  
treatm ent if they received study  drug until disease progression or until discontinuation for

92unacceptable toxicit y, wi thdrawal of consent, or death. An MPI/designee clinician reviewed 
the source data documenting disease progression prior to the invest igator taking the patient 
off treatm ent or stoppi ng disease assessments for PD. As of Amendment 6, however, the 
primary  endpoint has been met; as such, the PFS follow- up phase has been discont inued for 
patients currently receiving study  therapy . All central  and invest igator assessments of 
response and progression for protocol purposes will be discontinued, such that there will no 
longer be an MPI/designee clinician review o f the source data document ing disease 
progression.
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, only pat ients who are demonst rating clinical benefit 
and are unable to access a commercial supply o f ixazomib and/or lenalido mide and 
dexamethasone will remain in the study , until such time as other means of accessing the 
study  drugs are arranged. Complet ion of study  treatm ent will oc cur when pat ients 
discontinue study  drugs provi ded by  the sponsor in this clinical trial setting, or when the 
patient experiences disease progression, unacceptable toxicit y, withdrawal of consent, or 
death. The reason for treatment discont inuat ion must be recorded in the eCRF but no 
approval  is requi red.
Patients will  attend an EOT vi sit 30 days (+1 week) after receiving their last dose of the 
study  drug regimen unless next -line therapy is started before 30 day s after the l ast dose of 
study  drug, in which c ase the EOT visit should occur before the start of the next -line 
therapy . Refer to the Schedule ofEvents for End of Treatment visit assessments .
7.8   Completion of Study
Prior to implementati on of  Amendment 8, patients were considered to have co mpleted the 
study  if they  were f ollowed unt il death or until the sponsor terminated the study. Upon 
implementation of Amendment 8, patients will no lo nger be followed during any of the 
follow-up periods, as PFS and OS data are not being co llected. Patients will be considered to 
have co mpleted the study  if they com pleted study  treatm ent (see Section 7.7). 
7.9   Discontinuation of Treatment With Study Drug
Treatment with study  drug m ay be discont inued for any of the fo llowing reasons:
AE
Protocol  violation

Withdrawal by pat ient
Lost to follow -up
PD
Other
Prior to the invest igator taking the patient off treatment, the invest igator is required to 
submit the rationale to the MPI/designee clinician for review. Note that this is no longer 
requi red as of Amendment 6.
Once study  drug h as been discont inued, all study  procedures outlined for the EOT visit will 
be co mpleted as specified in the Schedule ofEvents . The primary  reaso n for study  drug 
discontinuat ion will  be recorded on the eCRF. 
7.10   Withdrawal of Patients From Study
A pat ient may also be wi thdrawn from  the study  for any  of the f ollowing reasons: 
Study  terminated by  sponsor
Withdrawal by pat ient
Lost to follow -up
Deat h
Other
Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, PFS and OS fo llow-up will no l onger be perform ed. 
Patients will  now com plete the study  immediately  following the end of treatment visit. The 
consequence o f study  withdrawal  is that no new informat ion will be co llected fr om the 
withdrawn pati ent and added to the exist ing data or any database.

   STATISTICAL AND QUAN TITATIVE ANALYSES
The final analysis data cutoff has been conducted and as such, the study  is considered 
complete for stati stical analysis purposes. The final analysis occur redin the fourth quarter of 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
942020. Upon implementation of Amendment 8, the investigator will unblind all patients 
remaining on study  treatm ent and will fo llow the new Schedule of Events presented in this 
amendment .No subsequent formal inferent ial statistical analyses will  be conducted; 
minimal descript ive analyses of safet y will be perform ed on pati ent data collected after the 
final analysis. The descript ion of the statist ical methods presented below reflects the full 
design for the stu dy for reference.
8.1   Statistical Methods
In general, summary tabulat ions will be presented by treatment arm and will display the 
number of observat ions, m ean, standard deviat ion, median, minimum, and maximum for 
continuous variables, and the number and p ercent per category  for categori cal data. The 
Kaplan -Meier survival curves and 25th, 50th(median), and 75thpercent iles will be provided 
along wi th their 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time- to-event data. 
Details for the final analysis will b e provi ded in the stati stical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP 
will be written by Millennium and will be finalized prior to the first planned IA. 
Deviat ions from  the stati stical analyses outlined in this protocol will be indicated in the 
SAP; any further modi fications will be noted in the final clinical study  report.
8.1.1    Determination of Sample Size
The primary  object ive of this study  is to determine if MLN9708 plus lenalido mide and 
dexamethasone improves PFS compared wit h placebo when added to lenalido mide an d 
dexamethasone in pat ients with relapsed and/or refractory  MM . The study  will not be 
stopped after the PFS analysis, however, even if a significant PFS is observed, in order to 
obtain an adequate event rate and statist ical power for OS analysis. To mainta in the overall 
strong control of Ty pe I error rate at a 2 -sided al pha l evel of 0.05, the cl osed sequential 
testing procedure will be used to test PFS and OS sequent ially both at a 2 -sided alpha level 
of 0.05. That i s, only  if PFS is significant based on th e O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending 
funct ion (the Lan -DeMets method) at the first IA and the second IA, the test of OS will be 
conducted on its own alpha spending funct ions.
The total sample size was calculated based on maintaining 80% power to test the OS. T he 
study  is also adequately powered to test PFS. Assuming a hazard ratio of 0.77 (median 
survival of 30 months in control arm versus 39 months in treatment arm), the number of 
death events needed is 486 (80% power and 2- sided alpha of 0.05). A total of app roximately 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
95703 pati ents will need to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into th ose 2 arm s, assuming an 
average enrollment rate of approximately 13 patients/m onth for the first 6 months, 
approximately  45 pati ents/m onth thereafter, and approximately  10% dropout ra te at m onth 
35. The final analysis o f OS is est imated to occur approximately 80 months from the 
enrollment of first patient, including a 20 -month rando mizat ion peri od and an addit ional 
60-mont h follow up f rom the l ast pati ent enrolled. Wit h an observed haz ard rati o of 0.833 
(eg, m edian OS of 30 months for control versus 36 months for treatm ent, 20% 
improvement), statist ical significance can be claimed at the final analysis with 486 death 
events. 
Assuming a hazard ratio of 0.728 (median PFS of 15 months in control  arm versus 
20.6 months in treatment arm), 365 PFS events will be needed (85% power and 2 -sided 
alpha of 0.05) wi th 2 planned IAs and the second IA as the final PFS analysis. The first IA 
will be performed when approximately 262 PFS events have occu rred. This will be the first 
analysis for PFS for statist ical test ing purpose. Based on the O’Brien -Fleming stopping 
boundary , the al pha l evel at the first IA and second IA on PFS would be 0.0163 and 0.0337, 
respectively, if the number of PFS events at the first IA i s exact ly 262. [41] Correspondingly, 
if the observed p value is less than 0.0163 and 0.0451 at the first IA and the second IA, 
respectively , the test for PFS w ill be claimed to be statist ically significant. With an 
assumpt ion of approximately 13 patients/month for the first 6 months, 45 patients/m onth 
thereafter, and approximately 10% dropout rate over 30 -mont
h follow-up peri od, 262 PFS 
events is expected to occ ur at approximately 24.5 mo nths after the first patient is enrolled 
and approximately 703 patients have been enro lled. This is the first IA of the study with the 
opportunit y to claim PFS benefi t. Wi th an observed hazard ratio of 0.743 (eg, median PFS 
of 15months in control arm versus 20.2 months in treatment arm), statist ical significance 
can be claimed at the analysis for PFS with 262 progression/death events. If the test for PFS 
is statistically  significant at the first IA, a non -inferent ial analysis o f PFS will be performed 
at the second IA where the PFS data is considered mature.
If the test for PFS is not statist ically significant at the first IA, the study  will cont inue and 
PFS testing will be conducted at the second IA when approximately 365 PFS even ts have 
occurred, which will also be the final analysis of PFS for statistical test ing purpose. An 
observed hazard ratio 0.810 (median PFS of 15 months in control arm versus 18.5 months in 
treatm ent arm ) or better will lead to statist ical significance for the PFS endpo int. If the test 
for PFS i s not statistically  significant at second IA, the study  will be claimed as unsuccessful 
and no further testing will be conducted. If the test for PFS is significant at an IA, the OS 
will be tested; however, the trial will not be stopped for overwhelming evidence of efficacy

96or fut ility at the first IA. The third IA will be for OS and will be performed when 
approximately  322 deaths (two -thirds of the total expected deaths) have occurred, with the 
opportunit y to stop the study  for overwhelming evidence of efficacy or futilit y. This IA is 
expected to occur approximately  44 m onths after the first patient is enro lled. 
Based on the O’Brien -Fleming stopping boundary , the al pha levels at the 3 planned OS IAs 
and final analysis woul d be 0.00014, 0.0017, 0.0100, and 0.0382, respectively  if the 
numbers of events at these analysis t ime po ints are exact ly 154, 222, 322, and 486. [41]
Correspondingl y, if the no minal p value is less than 0.0001, 0.0018, 0.0112, and 0.0462, 
respectively , at the first, second, and third IAs, and the final analysis, the test for OS will be 
claimed to be statistically significant. However, the study  will not be stopped af ter the first 
IA based on the test for OS. However, the actual boundary  coul d be adjusted if the actual 
number of events does not correspond to the projected number of events in the IAs or in the 
FA.
8.1.2    
Randomization and Stratification
Randomization schem e will be generated by  an independent statistician at Millennium who 
is not on the study  team . Prior to dosing, a rando mizat ion number will be assigned to each 
patient. The randomizat ion assignment will be implemented by  an IVRS. 
Eligible pat ients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into those 2 treatment arms, stratified by : 
1) 1 versus 2 or 3 pri or therapies , 2) proteasom e inhibitor exposed versus proteasome 
inhibitor naïve, and 3) ISS stage at screening of 1 or 2 versus stage 3.
8.1.3    Populations for Analys is
The populat ions used for analysis will include the fo llowing:
Safety population: The safet y popul ation is defined as all pat ients who receive at least 
1dose of any study  drug. Pati ents will be analyzed according to the treatment actually  
received. That is, those patients who are randomized to the active arm but received the 
regimen in the control arm will be included in the control arm; those patients who are 
rando mized to the con trol arm but received the regimen in the act ive arm will be included in 
the active arm for safet y analyses.
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population: The ITT population is defined as all pat ients who are 
rando mized. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they were rando mized to 
receive, regardless of any  errors of dosing.

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
97Per-Protocol (PP) population: The PP population is a subset of the ITT population. The PP 
popul ation consists of all pat ients who do not vio late the terms of the protocol in a way that 
woul d affect the study  outcom e significant ly, as determined by the stu dy clinician, who is 
blinded to study  drug assignment. All decisio ns to exclude pat ients from the PP popul ation 
will be made before the unblinding of the study .
8.1.4    Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data
All available efficacy and safet y data will be included in data list ings and tabulations. No 
imputati on of  values for missing data will be performed, unless specified otherwise. The 
relevance o f missing sample data will be assessed. Data that are potentially spurious or 
erroneous will be examined according to standard data management operating procedures.
8.1.5    Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The demographic and baseline characterist ics will be summarized in a descript ive fashion. 
Data to be evaluated will include age, gender, race, weight, baseline disease characterist ics, 
and other parameters, as appropriate.
8.1.6    Efficacy Analysis
8.1.6.1    Analyses for Primary Efficacy Endpoints
Note that, as of Amendment 6, the primary  endpoint of PFS has been met, and analyses for 
the PFS have be en com pleted. 
The analysis of primary endpo int, PFS, will be based on the ITT populat ion using 
IRC- assessed progression data. PFS is defined as the time fro m the date of rando mizat ion to 
the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whi chever occurs first. 
Patients wi thout docum entati on of  PD will  be censored at the date of last response 
assessment that is stable disease (SD) or better. 
PFS will be analyzed when approximately  262 and 365 PFS events have occurred for the 
first IA and for the second IA, respectively. A 2 -sided, stratified log -rank test will be used to 
compare the treatm ent groups wi th respect to PFS at a 2 -sided alpha level o f 0.0163 and 
0.0337, which corresponds to a nominal p value o f 0.0451 based on O’Brien -Fleming 
stopping boundary (the Lan -DeMets m ethod). In addi tion, an unadjusted stratified Cox 
model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CIs for the treatment effect using 
the stratificat ion factors. The Kaplan Meier (K -M) survival curves and K -M media ns (if 
estimable), along wit h their 2 -sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.

98Sensit ivity analyses for PFS include:
1.PFS assessed by  invest igator will be analyzed in the ITT populat ion.
2.PFS assessed by  IRC will  be analyzed in the per protocol population.
PFS assessed by  IRC using different censoring mechanisms will be analyzed in the ITT 
popul ation, for example, not censoring for patients who discontinue treatment and go on 
transpl ant or al ternat ive neoplast ic therapy. Details of diff erent censoring approaches will be 
included in the SAP.
Subgroup analyses will be performed for PFS relative to baseline stratificat ion factors, 
demographic data such as sex, race and age, and disease characterist ics such as t ype of prior 
regimen. 
If it is determined that the study  will continue after PFS is significant at a 2 -sided alpha level 
of 0.0163 at the first IA, a non -inferent ial analysis of PFS will be performed at the second 
IA. The PFS data will be considered as matured at the second IA.
8.1.6.2    Analyses of Key Secondary Efficacy
In addit ion to the primary  com parison of PFS and the first key  secondary endpoint OS, there 
is 1 addit ional key  secondary endpoint: OS in high -risk patients carrying del(17). This key 
secondary  endpoint will be tested only  if the test of OS is statistically significant at the IAs 
or final analysis at the same significance level as OS to ensure strong ty pe I error control for 
both key  secondary  endpoints.
Overall Survival
OS is defined as the time fro m the date of rando mizati on to the date of death. Patients 
without documentation of death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last 
known to be alive. OS will be analyzed based on the ITT populat ion. 
A 2-sided, stratified log -rank test will be used to compare the treatm ent groups wi th respect 
to OS. The test significance level at the IAs and final analysis is decided by the 
O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending funct ion (the Lan- DeMets method). In addit ion, an 
unadjusted stratified Cox model will be used to estimate the h azard rati o and i ts 95% CIs for 
the treatment effect using the stratificat ion factors. The K -M survival curves and K -M 
medians (if est imable), along with their 2 -sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each 
treatm ent group.

99Subgroup analyses will be perfo rmed for OS relative to baseline stratificat ion factors, 
demographic data such as sex, race, age, and disease characteristics such as t ype of prior 
regimen. 
Overall Survival in High -Risk Patients With del(17)
OS wi thin the high -risk subgroup will be analy zed using the similar method as OS in the 
overall populat ion. 
8.1.6.3    Analyses of Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Other secondary  efficacy parameters include overall response rate (ORR), the combined 
CR+VGPR rate, time to progression, duration of respons e, time to subsequent 
antineoplastic therapy, OS and PFS in high -risk popul ation carrying del(13),del(17), +1q21, 
transl ocati on t(4;14) or t(14;16), and pain response rate . 
Disease response -related endpoints will be analyzed using IRC -assessed response r ate.
ORR
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved PR or better relat ive to the ITT 
popul ation. Stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH) test will be used to compare ORR 
between the 2 treatment arms. A logistic regressio n model will be used to estimate the 
treatm ent effect in term s of odds ratio. The odds ratio and its associated 95% CIs will be 
presented.
The IRC -assessed response data will be used for the analysis. Invest igator -assessed response 
data will be used as sensit ivity analysis.
Combined CR +VGPR rate
The combined CR +VGPR rate will be analyzed using the same similar method as ORR. 
Time to Progression
TTP is defined as the time fro m the date of randomizat ion to the date of first documentation 
of PD. Pati ents wi thout documentation of PD at the time of analysis will be censored at the 
date of l ast response assessment that is SD or better. TTP will be analyzed based on the ITT 
popul ation using the similar method as PFS.

100Duration of Response
DOR i s defined as the time fro m the date of first documentation of a PR or better to the date 
of first docum entati on of  PD f or responders. Responders without documentation of PD will 
be censored at the date of last response assessment that is SD or better. DOR will be 
summarized descri ptively using the Kaplan -Meier method.
OS and PFS in High -Risk Population
OS and PFS in a high- risk popul ation, defined as patients carrying del(13), del(17), +1q21, 
transl ocati on t(4;14), or t(14;16) will be analyzed using the similar method as PFS and O S in 
ITT populat ion.
8.1.7    Analyses of Patient -Reported Outcomes and Health Economics
8.1.7.1    Quality of Life Analysis
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments using the EORTC QLQ -C30 and the MY -20 
will be analyzed using the ITT populat ion. The analysis will b e performed on summary  
scores as well as on subscales and individual symptoms.
Differences between treatment groups in the EORTC QLQ -C30 and MY- 20 scores will be 
evaluated using published minimally important difference (MID) values. Specific interest 
cente rs on physical funct ioning, gl obal quali ty of life summary  scores, and individual item 
scores for fat igue, nausea/vo miting, pain, dyspnea, appetite loss, and const ipation/diarrhea. 
The m ain endpoint for the PRO analysis will be the global health status/qu ality of life 
subscale o f the EORTC QLQ -C30 and MY- 20. The change in PRO scores between baseline 
and each postbaseline assessment will be described overall and according to the response to 
treatm ent. The other PRO endpoints include the remaining EORTC QLQ -C30 and MY-20 
subscale and individual item scores. The change in scores will be presented using 
cumulative frequency distribution figures. 
The analysis of PRO scores will be performed as a repeated -measures analysis using all 
available t ime points. The an alysis will use mixed model analysis o f variance.

(length of stay , inpat ient, outpati ent, and reason), number of missing days fro m work or 
other activit ies by pat ient and care -giver for treatment arms.
8.1.7.3    Pain 
Pain response rate will be analyzed in pat ients with baseline pain score ≥4 in the ITT 
popul ation. Pain Response Rate is the proportion of pat ients who have a pain response and 
will be summarized by  treatm ent groups. The CMH test will be used to compare the 
2treatm ent groups by  stratificati on factors. In additi on, the abso lute treatment difference in 
pain response rate will be provided, along wit h 95% CI.
Pain response is defined as the occurrence of a 30% reduction fro m baseline in BPI -SF 
worst pain score over the last 24 hours without an increase in analgesic use at 2 consecutive 
evaluat ions. 
Addit ional analyses on pain include:
Time to pain response/progression, as assessed by the time fro m rando mization to 
initial response/progression classification
Durati on of  pain response, m easured as the time from the first documented pain 
response to the firs t documented pain progression classificat ion
Time to pain progression and duration of pain response will be compared using the stratified 
log-rank test between the 2 treatment groups. An unadjusted stratified Cox model will be 
used to estimate the hazard r atio and i ts 95% CIs for the treatment effect using the 
stratificat ion factors. The K -M survival curves and K -M m edians (if estimable), along wit h 
their 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment arm. Time to pain response 
will be summarized descri ptively among pati ents wi th pain response. 
Pain progression is defined as the occurrence of 1 of the fo llowing and confirmed by 
2consecutive evaluat ions. To qualify as progression, the patient must have a BPI-SF worst 
pain score 4 duri ng progres sion.

104Development of new or worsening of exist ing selected SREs (eg, new fractures [excluding 
vertebral co mpressio n or rib fractures], irradiat ion of or surgery  on bone, or spinal cord 
compressi on) from baseline through the development of PD will be su mmar ized and 
presented. 
Descript ive statistics for the actual values of clinical laboratory parameters (and/or change 
from baseline in clinical laboratory  parameters) will be presented for all scheduled 
measurements over time. Mean laboratory  values over time will be plotted for key  
laboratory  parameters.
Descript ive statistics for the actual values and changes from baseline o f vital signs and 
weight will be tabulated by  scheduled time point. ECOG performance scores will be 
summarized using a shift table. 
Shift tables for laboratory  parameters will be generated based on changes in NCI CTCAE 
Grade fro m baseline to the worst post baseline value. Graphical displays o f key safety 
param eters, such as scatter plots of baseline versus worst post baseline values, may be used 
to understand the MLN9708 safet y profile.
All conco mitant m edicat ions collected from the first dose of study drug through the study  
period will be classified to preferred terms according to the World Healt h Organization 
(WHO) drug dict ionary.
Additional safety  analyses m ay be performed to most clearly  enumerate rates of toxicit ies 
and to further define the safet y profile o f MLN9708.
8.1.10    Interim Analyses
There are 3 planned IAs. The first IA will be performed when approximately 262 of the 
disease progressi on/death events have occurred. This IA is expected to occur approximately  
24.5 m onths after the first patient is enrolled. This is the first analysis for PFS for statist ical 
testing purpose and first IA for OS. During this IA, enrollment to the s tudy will cont inue. If 
the test for PFS is not statist ically significant at 2 sided alpha level o f 0.0163, the study  will 
continue and PFS testing will be conducted again at the second IA when approximately 
365PFS events have occurred, which will also be the final analysis o f PFS for stati stical 
testing purpose. Based on the projected number of PFS events, the statist ical significance of 
PFS coul d be cl aimed if the observed p value is less than 0.0451 (corresponding to nominal 
alpha of 0.0337). The trial will not be stopped due to the test for OS at the first IA. The third

105IA will be performed when approximately 322 deaths (two -thirds of the total expected 
deaths) have been observed. The third IA is expected to occur approximately 44 months 
after the first patient is enrolled. At that time, all patients have been enrolled. 
The test significance for the interim and final analyses of OS will be determined using 
O’Brien -Fleming boundaries (the Lan- DeMets m ethod). Based on the projected number of 
death events, the trial will be stopped for overwhelming efficacy if the observed p value is 
less than 0.0018 and 0.0112 at the second and third IA, respectively. The final analysis will 
be tested at 2 -sided al pha level  of 0.0462 (corresponding to nominal alpha of 0.038 2).
9.   STUDY COMMITTEES 
9.1   Steering Committee
A steering committee that includes a subset of investigators in this study  and representatives 
from Millennium will be formed to provide advice on the conduct of the study  and 
publicat ions (see also Section 12).
9.2   Independent Review Committee
An independent review co mmittee (IRC) has completed review of all disease evaluat ion data 
from the study  and d
etermined di sease status (response and progression). Data from the IRC 
will not be provided back to the invest igator during the conduct of the study. As o f 
Amendment 6, however, because PFS fo llow-up is now com pleted for this study , for all  
patients still receiving study  therapy , no further IRC reviews of disease response will take 
place. 
9.3   Independent Data Monitoring Committee
An IDMC supported by  an independent stati stician will review safet y and efficacy  data at 
3planned IAs. The IDMC will provide a recommendat ion regarding study  continuat ion 
based on the safet y and efficacy  param eters. In the event that the study  is terminated early 
based on the IDMC recommendation, Millennium will notify the appropriate regulatory  
authori ties. In addit ion, the IDMC will periodically review safet y data at regul arly scheduled 
meet ings prespecified in the IDMC charter. As part of the IDMC safet y monitoring, thi s 
committee will receive reports of all cases of new primary malignancies occurring during 
the trial.

106The first formal safet y review will occur after approximately  60 subjects (30 i n each arm ) 
have been randomized and received at least 1 cy cle of  study  treatment. Subsequent ly, 
periodic safet y reviews will also occur as prespecified in the IDMC charter.
Study  accrua l will not be interrupted due to the scheduled safet y reviews. The IDMC or 
MLN9708 study  team  may request an ad hoc meeting for any  reason, including a significant 
unexpected safety  event, unpl anned unblinding of study  resul ts, follow-up of  an observat ion 
during a pl anned IDMC meet ing, or a report external to the study, such as publicat ion of 
study  resul ts from a com peting product. At each review, subject incidence rates of AEs 
(including all serious, treatment -related, and serious treatment -related events, and events 
requi ring the discont inuat ion of study  drug) will be tabulated by  System  Organ Class, 
preferred term, and severit y grade. Listings and/or narratives of “on -study ” deaths and other 
serious and significant AEs, including any  early withdrawal s due to AEs, will be provided. 
Records of all meet ings will be archived. The IDMC will co mmunicate major safet y 
concerns and reco mmendat ions regarding study  modificat ion or terminat ion to Millennium. 
Further details will be provided in the IDMC charter.
10.   A DVERSE EVENTS
10.1   Definitions
10.1.1    Pretreatment Event Definition
A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but before administration of any study  
medicat ion; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with study  
participat ion.
10.1.2    Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occu rrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (invest igational) product whether 
or not i t is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a

MLN9708
Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
107previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of 
study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose m odificati on, therapeuti c intervent ion, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. 
10.1.3    Serious Adverse Event De finition
Serious AE (SAE) m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization
(see clarificati onin the paragraph below on planned hospitalizat ions).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent 1 of the outcom es listed above, or 
involves suspected transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the develo pment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any  organism, virus, or infect ious parti cle (eg, pri on protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent. 
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010. [51] Clarificat ion should be

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
108made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is consid ered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe
is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT 
the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to 
funct ion. A s evere AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily  need to be considered serious. For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.
10.2   Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent and/or in response to an open question fro m 
study  personnel or revealed by  observati on, physical  examinat ion, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Sect ion 10.3 for the 
period of observat ion). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicat ing a 
commo n underlying pathology  shoul d be noted as 1 com prehensive event.
Regardles s of causalit y, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Sect ion 10.1) 
must be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of observation) by the invest igator to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (contact informat ion provi ded 
below) by faxing the SAE Form within 24 hours after becoming aware of the event. The 
SAE Form, created specifica lly by Millennium, will be provided to each clinical study  site. 
A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study  Manual. Fo llow-up inform ation on 
the SAE or serious pretreatment event may be requested by  Millennium . SAE report 
inform ation must be consis tent wi th the data provided on the eCRF.
The paper SAE forms must be submitted via fax (see fax numbers below) within 24 hours of 
awareness. In case of fax, site personnel must confirm successful transmissio n of all pages 
and include an e
-mail address on t he fax cover sheet so that an acknowledgment of receipt 
can be returned via e -mail wit hin 1 business day . E-mail submissio n of paper SAE forms 
with a PDF attachment should only  be used in the case where fax is not possible wit hin 24 
hours of receiving the event. In case of e -mail, site personnel must confirm successful 
transmissio n by await ing an acknowledgment of the receipt via e -mail wit hin 1 business 
day. If SAEs are reported vi a fax or by  e-mail, the EDC applicat ion must be updated as soon

109as possible with th e appropriate information.
Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the study are not to be considered AEs unless the 
condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the study (eg, surgery was performed 
earlier or later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of 
the event and the relationship of the even t to study drug administration. For serious 
pretreatment events, the investigator must deter mine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study procedures
Intensity for each AE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010. [51] The criteria are provided in the 
Study Manual.
Relationship to study drug administration will be determined by the investigator responding 
yes or no to this question: Is there a reasonab le possibility that the AE is associated with the 
study drug?Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Ocal procal pro

11010.3   Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be monitored throughout the study as follows:
!AEs will be reported from the first dose of study drug through 30 days after 
administration of the last dose of study drug and recorded in the eCRFs. In addition, 
skeletal-related events that occur during the follow-up periods must be reported from 
the first dose of study drug through death or termination of the study by the sponsor. AEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).
!Serious pretreatment events will be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance or 
designee from the time of the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) up to first 
dose of study drug, but will not be recorded in the eCRF.
!Related and unrelated SAEs will be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance or 
designee from the first dose of study drug through 30 days after administration of the 
last dose of study drug or the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, whichever comes first, and recorded in the eCRF. After this period only related SAEs must be reported to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee. Serious 
adverse events should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined 
to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). In addition, new primary malignancies that occur during the follow-up periods must be reported, irrespective of causality to study regimen, to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance for a minimum of 3 years after last dose of the investigational 
product, from the first dose of study drug through death or termination of the studyby the sponsor. 
10.4   Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of 
age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study drug, or within 90 days of the subject’s last dos e of study drug, are considered immediately 
reportable events. Study drug is to be disc ontinued immediately. The sponsor must also be 
contacted immediately by faxing a completed Pregnancy Form to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (see Section 10.2) . The pregnancy must be 
followed for the final pregnancy outcome. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to  Drug Safety

111immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-
gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling.
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify  Drug Safety immediately about the 
outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy 
Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets 
any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to 
Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs. In a ddition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects 
is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to 
 Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, 
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or 
approved equivalent form. 
Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the 
male subject taking study drug must notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcar e provider immediately. The sponsor must also be 
contacted immediately by faxing a completed Pregnancy Form to the Millennium 
Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (see Section 10.2) . Every effort should be 
made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.

11.1   Good Clinical Practice
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the ICH -GCP and the appropriate regulatory  
requi rement(s). Th e invest igator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the 
study  drug as described in the protocol and the IB.
11.2   Data Quality Assurance
The invest igator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study 
patient. Study  data will be entered into an eCRF by  site personnel  using a secure, validated, 
web-based electronic data capture (EDC) applicat ion. Millennium will have access to a ll 
data upon entry  in the EDC applicat ion. 
Study  monitors will discuss instances of missing or uninterpretable data with the 
investigator for resolution. Any changes to study  data will  be made to the eCRF and 
docum ented via an el ectroni c audi t trail  assoc iated wi th the affected eCRF.
11.3   Electronic Case Report Form Completion 
Millennium or designee will provide the study  sites wi th secure access to and training on the 
EDC applicat ion, sufficient to permit site personnel to enter or correct information in the 
eCRFs for the patients for whom they are responsible.
eCRFs will be co mpleted for each study  patient. It is the invest igator’s responsibilit y to 
ensure the accuracy , com pleteness, clari ty, and t imeliness of the data reported in the 
patient’s eCRF.
The invest igator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as 
possible after information is co llected.
The invest igator must provide through the EDC applicat ion formal approval of all  the 
inform ation in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endorse the final submitted data for 
the pati ents for which he or she is responsible. The audit trail entry  will show the user’s 
ident ificat ion informat ion and the date and time of the correction.

113Millennium, or a designee, will retain the eCRF data and corresponding audit trails. A copy  
of the final archival eCRF in the form of a compact disk (CD) or other electronic media will 
be placed in the invest igator’s study  file.
11.4   Study Monitoring
Moni toring and audit ing procedures developed or approved by Mi llennium will be fo llowed 
to com ply wit h GCP guidelines.
All information recorded on the eCRFs for this study  must be consistent with the patient’s 
source documentation. During the course of the study , the study  monitor will  make study  
site visi ts to revi ew protocol  com pliance, verify  eCRFs against source documentation, assess 
drug accountabilit y, and ensure that the study  is being conducted according to pertinent 
regul atory  requi rements. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner that 
ensures that pati ent confident iality is maintained. 
In the event a monitor cannot visit the site in a timely manner due to the COVID -19 
pandemic, alternat ive monitoring approaches such as remote source data verificat ion (SDV) 
or telephone contact m ay be used to ensure data qualit y and integri ty and maintain pat ient 
safet y. Alternative m onitoring approaches should be used only  where all owed by  the l ocal 
Health Authori ty and permi tted by  the IRB/IEC.
11.5   Ethical Considerations
The study  will be conducted in acco rdance with applicable regulatory  requi rement(s) and 
will adhere to GCP standards. 
The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study  docum entati on to safeguard the rights, safety , 
and well -being o f the pati ents. The study  will be conducted only  at si tes where IRB/IEC 
approval  has been obtained. The protocol, IB, ICF, advertisements (if applicable), written 
inform ation given to the patients (including diary  cards), safet y updates, annual progress 
reports, and any  revisi ons to these docum ents will  be provi ded to the IRB/IEC by  the 
investigator or the sponsor, as allowed by  local regul ations.
11.6   Patient Information and Informed Consent
After the study  has been fully  explained, wri tten inform ed consent will be obtained from 
either the pati ent or his/her guardian o r legal representati ve before study  parti cipat ion. The 
method of obtaining and document ing the informed consent and the contents of the consent 
must com ply with the ICH -GCP and all applicable regulatory  requi rements.

114Upon implementation o f Amendment 8, pat ients on study  treatm ent m ust be reconsented 
before dosi ng on Day  1 of the next full treatm ent cycle. Written consent documents will 
embody  the el ements of informed consent as described in the Declarat ion of Helsinki and 
the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance wit h all applicable laws and 
regul ations.
11.7   Patient Confidentiality
To m aintain patient privacy , all eCRFs, study  drug accountabilit y records, study  reports, and 
communicat ions will ident ify the pat ient by initials where permitted and/o r by the assigned 
patient number. The pati ent’s confident iality will be m aintained and will not be made 
publicly  available to the extent permitted by  the applicable laws and regulat ions.
11.8   Investigator Compliance
The invest igator will conduct the trial in co mpliance wi th the protocol  provi ded by 
Millennium and given approval/favorable opinio n by the IRB/IEC and the appropriate 
regul atory  authori ty(ies). Modificat ions to the protocol are not to be made without 
agreem ent of  both the invest igator and Millennium. Changes to the protocol will require 
written IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinio n before implementation, except when the 
modificati on is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard or hazards to patients. Millennium, 
or a designee, will submit all protocol modificat ions to the appropriate regulatory  
authori ty(ies) in accordance with the governing regulat ions.
When immediate deviation fro m the protocol  is requi red to eliminate an immediate hazard 
or hazards to patients, the invest igator will contact Millenni um, or a desi gnee, if 
circumstances permit, to discuss the planned course of action. Any departures from the 
protocol  must be docum ented.
11.9   On-site Audits
Regulatory  authori ties, the IEC/IRB, and/or Millennium/designee may request access to all 
source do cuments, eCRFs, and other study documentation for on -site audi t or inspect ion. 
Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by  the invest igator, who must provide 
support at all times for these activit ies.

the drug, if approved by Millennium) will be maint ained by the clinical site. Millennium or 
its designee will review drug accountability at the site on an ongoing basis. Refer to the 
Pharmacy Manual for additional details.
All material containing study drug will be treat ed and disposed of in accordance with 
governing regulations.
11.11   Product Complaints and Medication Errors (Including Overdose)
A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies dissatisfaction 
regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality , or stability of a drug product. Individuals 
who identify a potential product complaint situation should immediately contact Dohmen 
Life Sciences (see below) and report the event. Whenever possible, the associated product should be maintained in accordance with the label instructions pending further guidance 
from a Millennium Quality representative.
A medication error is a preventable event that i nvolves an identifiable patient and that leads 
to inappropriate medication use, which may result in patient harm. Whereas overdoses constitute medication errors, doses missed inadvertently by a patient do not. Individuals who identify a potential medication error situation should immediately report this via the phone 
number or e-mail address provided below.
For Product Complaints or Medication Errors (Including 
Product complaints or medication errors in and of themselves are not AEs. If a product 
complaint or a medication error results in an SAE, an SAE form should be completed and

15.2   Multiple Myeloma Diagnostic Criteria
IMWG Criteria for the Diagnosis of Myeloma
Diagnosis Diagnostic Criteria: All Three Required
Symptomatic multiple myelomaaMonoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow 10% and/or 
presence of a biopsy -proven plasmacy toma
Monoclonal protein present in the serum and/or urineb
Myeloma -related organ dysfunction ( 1)c
[C] Calcium elevation in the blood (serum calcium 
>10.5 mg/l or upper limit of normal)
[R] Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2mg per 
100ml)
[A] Anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g per 100 ml or 2 g <normal)
[B] Lyt ic bone lesions or osteoporosisd
Source: International Myeloma Foundation, myeloma.org. Accessed 16 January 2012.
aThese criteria identify Stage IB and Stages II and III A/B myeloma by Durie/Salmon stage. Stage IA 
becomes smoldering or indolent myeloma.
bIf no mo noclonal protein is detected (non-secretory disease), then 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma 
cells and/or a biopsy -proven plasmacytoma required.
cA variety of other types of end -organ dysfunctions can occasionally occur and lead to a need for therapy. 
Such dy sfunction is sufficient to support classification as myeloma if proven to be myeloma related.
dIf a solitary (biopsy -proven) plasmacy toma or osteoporosis alone (without fractures) is the sole defining 
criteria, then 30% plasma cells are required in the bone marrow.

aOpioid drugs NOT recommended include meperidine, methadone, pro poxyphene, partial agonists 
(bupreno rphine), and mixed agonist -antagonists (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine).
bOral morphine equivalent (OME) score is based on an oral morphine dose of 30 mg; the conversion 
factor listed is for chronic dosing. Avoid using morphine in renal failure.
cAvailable in transdermal system for extended dosing. See the calculation below for dose conversion from 
other opioids to transdermal fentanyl.
dWeak opioid receptor agonist with some antidepressant activity; fo r mild to moderate pain. 
Recommended dose of 100 mg 4 times daily (maximum daily dose of 400 mg) to avoid central nervous 
system toxicity. At maximum dose, tramadol is less potent than other opioid analgesics.
Oral Morphine Equivalence Conversion Calcula tion
To cal culate the oral  morphine equivalent (OME) score of an opioid in Table 15-2:
X dose of an opio id equivalent to an oral morphine dose of 30 mg
Y dose of that opio id consumed by the pat ient in the last 24 h ours
OME of that opioid consumed in the last 24 hours Y / X 30
Example: A pat ient consumed 100 mg of oral codeine in the last 24 hours. The OME 
calculat ion is:
X 200 m g
Y 100 m g
OME of oral codeine 100 / 200 30 15 mg

Relapse Subcategory Relapse Criteria
Progressive disease (PD)a
To be used for calculation of 
time to progression and PFS 
endpoints for all subjects, 
including those in CR (includes 
primary  progressive disease 
and disease progression on or 
off therapy)Progressive Disease: requires any 1 or more of the following:
Increase of 25% fro m nadir in
Serum M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be 
0.5g/dL)b
Urine M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be 
200mg/24 h
Only in subjects without measurable serum and urine M -protein 
levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. 
The absolute increase must be > 10 mg/dL
Bone marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute % must be 10%
Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions
or soft tissue plasmacytomasc
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium 
>11.5 mg/dL or 2.85 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the 
plasma cell proliferative disorder
Abbreviations: CR = complete response; PFS= progression -free survival .
aAll relapse categories require 2 consecutive assessments made at anytime before classification as relapse 
or disease progression and/or the institution of any new therapy.
bFor progressive disease, serum M -component increases of 1 g/dL are sufficien t to define relapse if 
starting M -component is 5 g/dL.
cA definite increase of plasmacytoma is defined as a 50% (and at least 1 cm) increase as measured serially 
by the sum of the products of the cross -diameters of the measurable lesion.

aReview by MPI/designee clinician required prior to discontinuing patient from treatment.
bTests and procedures should be performed on schedule, but occasional changes may be allowed (± 2 days) for holidays, vacation s, and other administrative reasons. 
If the study schedule is shifted, assessments must be shifted to ensure that collection of assessments is completed prior to dosing. If extenuating circumstances 
prevent a patient from beginning treatment or completing a scheduled procedure or assessment w ithin this time, the patient may continue the study only with the 
permission of the MPI/designee clinician.
cConfirmation of patient eligibility by MPI/designee clinician required prior to randomization.
dHeight assessed at screening only.
ePregnancy te sts (Refer to Section 7.4.7 ):
Screening: Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have 2 negative pregnancy tests prior to starting study drug. The first pregnancy test must be 
performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the start of study drug and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hou rs prior to the start of study drug.
On-Treatment: Pregnancy tests for FCBP to be collected weekly during Cycle 1 and then within 24 hours before the first dose of each subsequent cycle. 
Lenalidomide package insert must be followed while patients remain on therapy. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for 
thefirst 28 days and then ever y 14 day s while on therapy.
End of Treatment: Pregnancy tests for FCBP to be collected at treatment discontinuation and at Day 28 following therapy. If m enstrual cycles are irregular, the 
pregnancy testing must occur at drug dis continuation and at Days 14 and 28 following drug discontinuation.
fClinical laboratory evaluations will be performed by a central laboratory. For dosing decisions, local hematology and chemist ry laborato ry results may  be used; 
however, samples must still be sent to central labs as well. Hematology and chemistry panels may be collected up to 3 days before Day 1 dosing and 24 hou rs before 
Days 8, 15 and 22 dosing, where required. Local laboratory evaluations may be done more frequently at the investigators discretio n, ie, for acute management of 
TEAEs (refer to Section 7.4.9 ). 
gThyroid testing required ever y 4 cycles on treatment.
h Patient- reportedoutcomes and HU assessment should be completed before any other study procedures are performed or study drug is administered. During the OS 
follow -up, assessments can be made over the phone and do not require a clinic visit. (Refer to Sections 7.4.11 to 7.4.14 .)

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
16015.15    Amendment 2 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 2
The primary  rationale for thi s amendment is to establish a China continuation o f 
Study C16010. This amendment describes modifications to the global study  procedures 
specifically for patients who enroll in the China cont inuat ion. Pati ents fro m China who 
enroll in the gl obal study  will not be affected. Following completion o f enrollment in the 
global study  (703 patients), up to approximately 120 additional pat ients from China will be 
enrolled in the China continuat ion. 
The China continuat ion is an extensio n of the global study  that will  cont inue to assess the 
primary  object ive of progression -free survival (PFS) in patients fro m China. Select other 
secondary object ives that directly relate to disease response assessment and safet y will also 
be evaluated to thoroughly characterize the efficacy and safet y signals of MLN9708 in this 
popul ation. These objec tives are overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), 
complete response + very  good parti al response rate (CR + VGPR), duration of response 
(DOR), time to progression (TTP), and safet y. Addi tional secondary  and exploratory  
objectives will be explor ed in the gl obal study  but are not included in the China continuation 
because they  are signal -seeking in nature. Objectives that are subsequent ly determined to be 
of clinical relevance may  be evaluated in future clinical studies.
The primary  object ive of PFS will  be assessed when 50% of PFS events have occurred or a 
minimum o f 18months after the first patient is enrolled in the China continuat ion, 
whichever occurs first. OS will be assessed when 50% of events have occurred or a 
minimum o f 2 years after th e last pati ent is enrolled in the China continuation, whichever 
occurs first. These assessment times will allow detection of any trends in the data and 
demonstrate consistency with the global dataset.
This amendment will allow for in -depth characterization of the pharm acokineti c (PK) 
properties of MLN9708 for patients in China. While the global study  implements sparse PK 
sampling, the China cont inuat ion includes extensive PK sampling on up to 30 pati ents to 
obtain data on approximately 12 PK -evaluable pat ients in the MLN9708 plus lenalido mide 
and dexamethasone (LenDex) arm. 
Purposes for Amendment 2
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Add background epidemio logy information on multiple myelo ma in the Chinese 
popul ation
Clarify  that the primary  object ive w ill be assessed in patients fro m China
Update the number of pat ients from 703 to 120 to reflect the approximate number of 
patients f rom China that will be enrolled in the China cont inuat ion
Modify the PK objective and corresponding endpoint to remove spars e PK sam pling 
and add full characterization o f PK in up to 30 patients
Remove secondary  objectives (and corresponding endpoints and study  procedures) that 
do not di rectly contribute to the characterization of the efficacy or safet y of MLN9708

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
16215.16    Amendment 3 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 3
The primary  reason for thi s amendment is to add an addit ional progressi on-free survival 
(PFS) analysis, which will be considered the final PFS analysis. The second PFS analysis 
will allow more PFS data at a later date in addit ion to the first PFS analysis in the current 
protocol , and update the assumption on median PFS for both arms for sample size 
calculat ion based on the reported delayed events in 2 ongoing phase 3 studies (also being 
conducted in the same disease setting wit h the same primary endpoint). The original planned 
first in terim  analysis (IA [which was the final analysis (FA) for PFS]) will be conducted at a 
later date when approximately  262 PFS events have occurred. The added PFS analysis (the 
new FA) i s to be conducted when approximately 365 PFS events have occurred. The a lpha 
allocat ion for PFS will be based on the O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending funct ion (the 
Lan-DeMets m ethod). If the PFS IA is statist ically significant, the PFS FA will be a 
non-inferent ial test only. Those 2 PFS analyses also serve as the first IA and se cond IA for 
overall survival (OS).
Purposes for Amendment 3
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Update the statist ical and quantitative analyses sections to include the assumpt ions on 
PFS for sample size calculat ion and addit ional IA
Remove the non -inferential test on PFS at the original planned second IA
Reclassify of the secondary bio marker object ives to exploratory  objectives
Update the cover page with current signatories
Update the study  overview diagram to remove subsequent anti -neopl astic therapy  as a

Clarify  the pharmacokinet ic sampling schedule
Remove assessments of specific gene mutations of the P13K pathway  and indicate that 
similar analyses will be done in tumor samples from patients who init ially responded to

Indicate that circulat ing proteasome levels will be assessed
Clarify  the PFS and OS assessment intervals in the Overview of the Study  Design

Clinical Study Protocol C16010 Amendment 8, 08 January 2021
16715.19     Amendment 6 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 6
The primary  reason for thi s amendment is to discont inue study  assessments and the PFS 
follow-up period for patients still receiving study therapy, now that the primary  endpoint of 
progression -free survival (PFS) is co mplete. Endpoints relating to diseas e response (ie, PFS, 
response rate, time toprogression) will not be assessed for protocol purposes after the 
primary  endpoint is m et;as such, all efficacy  response data (i e, blood, serum , and urine 
samples for assessment of response) will stop being coll ected/sent to the central laboratory  
to minimize the burden on study  patients and avo id unnecessary procedures . The other main 
reason for this amendment is to remove the fut ility boundary for overall survival (OS) at the 
third interim analysis to ensure th e collection o f sufficient long- term safet y data and avert 
potenti al premature terminat ion of OS evaluat ion, a key  secondary endpoint.
Other changes clarify study procedures, as noted in the following list.
Purposes for Amendment 6
The purposes of this ame ndment are to:
Remove m ention of the Safet y Management Attachment, which no longer exists
Discontinue the PFS fo llow-up peri od and all efficacy  response assessments, including 
laboratory  assessments, for protocol purposes because PFS significance has been met 
in the study
Remove the fut ility boundary for OS at the third interim analysis and n ote that the 
actual efficacy  boundaries m ay be adj usted if the actual number of events does not 
correspond to the projected number of events in the remaining analyses
Update the excluded conco mitant m edicat ion informat ion to reflect recent population 
pharmacokinet ics (PK)analyses and drug -drug interaction study  resul ts from Study  
C16009 demonstrating that cytochrom e P450 inhibitors do not affect MLN9708 PK
Clarify  the m anagement of rash, including adding a table of steroid equivalent doses
Clarify  the management of overdose
Clarify  the instructi ons for study  drug dispensing
Clarify  the procedure for performing the physical examinat ion
Clarify  when central  laboratory  resu lts must be reviewed before init iating the next 
treatm ent cycle
Note that PK sample co llection for the study  has now been com pleted for all patients
Add an email address for reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs in Japan
Clarify  the m onitoring of AEs and period of observat ion
Update the procedures for product complaint s to include instruction sfor reporting 
medicat ion errors and overdose

16815.20    Amendment 7 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 7
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment
No.7.This amendment describes modificat ions to the study procedures specifically  for 
patients who are enrolled in the China -specific protocol continuation o f Study  C16010. 
Patients fro m China who are enrolled in the glo bal C16010 study will not be affected by  this 
amendment. 
As of Amendment 7, analysis o f the primary  endpoint of progressi on-free survival (PFS) (at 
the primary  analysis) and of the secondary  endpoint of overall survival (OS) (at the final 
analysis) have been co mpleted. The rationale for this ame ndment is to discont inue disease 
response assessments (ie, PFS, response rate, time to progression), discont inue efficacy 
response assessments (ie, blood, serum, and urine samples), discont inue PFS and OS 
follow-up assessments for all pat ients, and discont inue all fo llow-up of  patients who have 
completed study  treatm ent. In addi tion, the obj ective of this amendment is to provide 
patients who are still on study  treatm ent wi th cont inued access to study  drugs and to 
continue to collect relevant safet y informat ion. Also, after unblinding of patients after the 
positive final survival analysis, this amendment will allow pat ients who are currently 
receiving placebo in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone the option to 
continue receiving lenalido mide and dexamethasone alo ne or, based on the invest igator’s 
opinio n, MLN9708 in co mbinat ion with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
Other changes clarify study procedures as noted in the following list. 
Minor grammat ical, editorial, and formatting changes are included for cl arificat ion purposes

REVISED THROUGHOUT THE PROTOCOL.
Change 1:Clarifythe study  objectives as of Amendment 8.
The primary  change occurs in Section 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES :
Added 
text:Note that the primary objective and corresponding endpoint have been met. 
Upon implementation of Amendment 8, the objective is to continue to collect 
long-term safety data from patients who are continuing on ixazomib 
(MLN9708) and LenDex or LenDex (note the placebo capsule will be 
discontinued) because of continuing clinical benefit. Data collection for all 
other study objectives and endpoints will be complete at the time of the final 
analysis and no further formal analyses will be conducted. The original lists 
of objectives are retained below for reference only.
Rationale for Change :
To cl arify the study  objective at this point in the study .
The Protocol  Summary also contains this change.
Change 2:Clarifythe study  endpo ints as of Amendment 8.
The primary  change occurs in Section 3STUDY ENDPOINTS :
Added 
text:Note that the primary endpoint has been met. Upon implementation of 
Amendment 8, evaluation of the safety profile of MLN9708 and/or LenDex 
is the only endpoint being assessed. Analysis of all other study endpoints will 
be complete at the final analysis and no further formal statistical analyses 
will be performed. However, the complete list of endpoints is retained below 
for reference.

171Change 3:Clarifythat the final analysis data cutoff has been conducted and the study  is 
considered complete for statist ical analysis purposes.
The primary  change occurs in Section 8 STATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE 
ANALYSES :
Added 
text:The final analysis data cutoff has been conducted and as such, the study is 
considered complete for statistical analysis purposes. The final analysis is 
expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2020. Upon implementation of 
Amendment 8, the investigator will unblind all patients remaining on study 
treatment and will follow the new Schedule of Events presented in this 
amendment . No subsequent formal inferential statistical analys es will be 
conducted; minimal descriptive analyses of safety will be performed on 
patient data collected after the final analysis. The description of the 
statistical methods presented below reflects the full design for the study for 
reference.
Rationale for Change :
To note that the data cutoff date for the final analysis has now occurred; no subsequent 
formal inferent ial stati stical analyses will  be conducted after the final analysis. 
Change 4:Add language to clarify ongo ing treatment of patients —pati ents still receiving 
study  treatm ent will stay  on thei r assigned study  regimen. Pati ents shou ld be moved off 
study  and onto an al ternative supply of (eg, commercially  available) ixazo mib  and/or 
LenDex, or onto another standard of care treatment.
The primary  change occurs in the Schedule ofEvents :
Initial 
wording:As of Amendment 6, the primary  endpoint of PFS has been met, and as such, the 
PFS follow -up peri od is now com pleted and for all patients still receiving study  
therapy , all central  and invest igator assessments of response and progression for 
protocol  purposes will be discont inued. Thus, for ease of study conduct, the 
Schedule of Events now presented has been simplified to apply to the remainder 
ofthe study . The full  Schedule of Events as of Amendment 3 has been moved to 
Secti on  15.12. The PK sampling schedule has also been moved to Section  
15.12, as i t was applicable through Cycle 10, which has been co mpleted for all 
patients.
Amended 
or new 
wording:The final analysis data cutoff has been conducted and as such, the study is 
considered complete for statistical analysis purposes. Upon implementation 
of Amendment 8, the investigator will unblind all patients remaining on 
study treatment and will f ollow the new Schedule of Events . 
Only patients who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit but who do not 
have other means of access to the study drugs will continue on the study. 
Because no further formal statistical analyses will be performed, only 
assessments contributing to long- term safety monitoring are required. Most 
study assessments besides safety are discontinued to ease the burden of 
protocol -mandated assessments on patients. Patients continuing their

172current study treatment may do so until su ch time as other means of 
accessing the study drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should 
complete an EOT visit and transition onto an alternative supply of (eg, 
commercially available) ixazomib (MLN9708) and/or LenDex, or onto 
another standard of c are treatment. Discontinued patients will be treated by 
their physician per local standard of care.
Patients who are receiving ixazomib plus LenDex will continue to receive 
ixazomib plus LenDex.  Patients who are receiving placebo plus LenDex will 
receive LenDex only; the placebo capsule will no longer be administered 
and patients receiving placebo will not be crossed over to ixazomib in this 
study. Upon implementation of Amendment 8, data collection requirements 
will be limited to collection of AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medications. 
Quality of life, health care utilization, EQ -5D, and pain assessments are 
discontinued. Survival data will no longer be collected because the analysis 
of OS will be complete at the time of the final analysis. Other study 
assess ments are no longer required, as noted in the new Schedule of Events. 
Patients will not be followed for the OS follow -up period because OS data 
are no longer being collected.
As of Amendment 6, the primary  endpoint of PFS has been met, and as such, the 
PFS follow-up peri od is now com pleted and for all patients still receiving study  
therapy , all central  and invest igator assessments of response and progression for 
protocol  purposes will be discont inued. Thus, for ease of study conduct, the 
Schedule of Events now presented has been simplified to apply to the remainder 
of the study . The full  Schedule of Events as of Amendment 3 has been moved to 
Secti on  15.12. The PK sampling schedule has also been moved to Section  
15.12, as i t was applicable through Cycle 10, which has been co mpleted for all 
patients.

wording:Patients who stop treatment for any  reason will cont inue to have OS fo llow-up 
visits. See the Schedule of Events for appropriate assessments. All subsequent 
antineoplastic therapies will be recorded, regardless if they are init iated before or 
after PD. Pati ents who start an alternative ant ineoplastic therapy  prior to disease 
progression will cont inue to be fo llowed for progressio n. As of Amendment 6, 
however, the primary endpoint has been met. As such, the PFS fo llow-up phase 
has been discontinued for all pat ients current ly receiving study th erapy  and f or 
any pat ients who discont inued treatment for other reasons, including pat ients 
who start an alternat ive therapy before PD. All pat ients discontinuing study 
treatm ent will be assessed for OS but no longer for PFS.
Patients who stop treatment du e to PD will cont inue to have overall survival 
visits/assessments. During the OS fo llow-up, assessments can be made over the 
phone and do not require a clinic visit. Data may  be collected by  methods that 
include but are not limit ed to telephone, e -mail, ma il, and social securit y indexes. 
The OS fo llow-up shoul d be conducted every  12 weeks after documented PD 
until death or terminat ion of the study  by the sponsor. All  subsequent 
antineoplastic therapies will be recorded during the OS fo llow up peri od.
Inform ation for new primary malignancy should be collected during the study , 
including the PFS and OS follow -up peri ods. As of Amendment 6, however, the 
primary  endpoint has been met; as such, the PFS follow- up phase has been 
discontinued for patients currently receiving study  therapy . All patients 
discontinuing study  treatm ent will  be assessed for OS but no longer for PFS.
NOTE: Related SAEs must be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee. This includes deaths that the investigator
considers related to study  drug that occur during the posttreatment fo llow-up. In 
addition, new primary  malignancies that occur during the follow -up periods,

176Chan ge7:Revise informat ion regarding the interim analyses.
The primary  change occurs in Section 4.1Overview of Study  Design :
Initial 
wording:As of Amendment 6, the first 2 IAs have been performed. The primary analysis 
(data cutoff date, 30 October 2014) occurred when 286 patients had experienced 
disease progressi on or death; at thi s analysis, the primary  endpoint of PFS was 
met. The next analys is (data cutoff date, 12 July  2015) occurred when 372 
patients had experienced disease progression or death. This was the first analysis 
for OS. It was found that OS data were not y et mature and the study  was to 
continue, fo llowing the pati ents for surviva l. 
The thi rd IA for OS will occur when approximately 322 deaths have been 
reported. The trial will be stopped for overwhelming efficacy if the O’Brien -
Fleming efficacy boundary  is crossed at the third IA.[41] However, the actual 
boundary  coul d be adjusted if the actual number of events does not correspond to 
the proj ected number of events in the remaining IA or in the final analysis (FA).
An independent data monitoring co mmittee (IDMC) will review safet y and 
efficacy  data at the IAs. See Section 9.3 for mo re inform ation.
Amended 
or new 
wording:As of Amendment 68, the first 23 IAs have been performed. The primary 
analysis (data cutoff date, 30 October 2014) occurred when 286 patients had 
experienced disease progression or death; at this analysis, the primary endpo int 
of PFS was m et. The next analysis (data cutoff date, 12 July 2015) occurred 
when 372 patients had experienced disease progression or death. This was the 
first analysis for OS. It was found that OS data were not yet mature and A total 
of 171 deaths had been reported and the threshold for OS statistical 
significance wa s not met. Per the study design and statistical analysis plan,
the study  was to continue, following the patients for survival. The third IA 
(data cutoff date, 25 October 2017) occurred when 333 deaths had been 
reported. The threshold for statistical signif icance was not met and the 
study was to continue to the final analysis. The final analysis occurred in the 
fourth quarter of 2020. 
The thi rd IA for OS will occur when approximately  322 deaths have been 
reported. The trial will be stopped for overwhelming efficacy if the O’Brien-
Fleming efficacy boundary  is crossed at the third IA.[41] However, the actual 
boundary  coul d be adjusted if the actual number of events does not correspond to

177Change 8:Update language about the management of clinical events in pat ients receiving 
ixazo mib.
The primary  change occurs in Section 6.10 Managem ent of  Clinical Events :
Initial 
wording:Prophylaxis Against Risk of Reactivation of Herpes Infection
Patients m ay be at an increased risk of infect ion including reactivation o f herpes 
zoster and herpes simplex viruses . Ant iviral therapy  such as acycl ovir or 
valacyc lovir may be init iated as clinically indicated . 
…
Nausea and/or Vomiting
Standard anti -emet ics including 5 -hydroxy tryptamine 3 serotonin receptor (5 -
HT3) antagonists are recommended for emesis if it  occurs once treatment is 
initiated; prophylact ic ant i-emetics may also be considered at the physician’s 
discreti on. Dexamethasone should not be administered as an anti -emet ic. Fluid 
deficit should be corrected before init iation of study drug and during trea tment.
Diarrhea
Prophylactic ant idiarrheals will not be used in this protocol . However, diarrhea 
shoul d be managed according to clinical pract ice, including the administration of 
antidiarrheals once infect ious causes are excluded . Fluid intake should be 
maintained to avoi d dehydrati on. Fluid deficit should be corrected before 
initiation of treatment and during treatment . 
Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus
…
Rash may  range from  som e ery thematous areas, macular and/or small papular 
bumps that may or may not be prurit ic over a few areas of the body, to a more 
generalized eruption that is predominant ly on the trunk or extremit ies. Rash has 
been most commo nly characterized as maculopapular or macular. To date, when 
it does occur, rash is most commo nly reported wi thin the first 3 cy cles o f 
therapy . The rash is often transient and self- limit ing and is ty pically  Grade 1 to 2 
in severit y. As in many other oncology  trials, rash may occur in patients 
receiving placebo and in patients receiving MLN9708. If rash occurs, 
consideration should be given to alternate causes of the rash such as conco mitant

TEAEs. These severe, potentially life -threatening or deadly condit ions may 
involve rash with skin peeling and mouth sores and should be c linically managed 
according to standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological 
analysis are encouraged at the discretion of the investigator. Addit ional 
inform ation regarding these react ions can be found in the IB . 
Thrombocytopenia
Blood counts shoul d be m onitored regul arly as outlined in theprotocol  with 
additional testing obtained according to standard clinical practice . 
Thrombocy topeni a may  be severe but has been manageable with platelet 
transfusio ns according to standard clinica l practice . Lenalido mide or study  drug 
administration should be modified as per dose modificat ion recommendat ions in 
theprotocol when thrombocy topeni a occurs (see Table 6-1). Therapy  can be 
reinit iated at a reduced level upon recovery  of platel et counts . A rare risk is 
thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura, a rare blood disorder where blood clots 
form in small blood vessels throughout the body  characteri zed by  
thrombocy topenia, petechi ae, fever, or possibly  more seri ous si gns and 
symptoms . Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be managed 
symptom atically according to standard medical practice.
Fluid Deficit
Dehydrat ion shoul d be avo ided since lenalido mide is substant iallyexcreted by  
kidney, and MLN9708 may cause vo miting, di arrhea ,and dehydrat ion. Acute 
renal failure has been reported in pat ients treated with MLN9708, co mmo nly in 
the setting of the previously noted gastrointest inal toxicities and dehy dration. 
Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of study  drug as needed during 
treatm ent to avoi d dehydrat ion(see Section 6.8).
Hypot ension
Symptom atic hypotensio n and orthostatic hypotension wit h or without syncope 
have been reported with MLN9708 . Blood pressure shoul d be cl osely  monitored 
while the patient is on study  treatm ent and fluid deficit should be corrected as 
needed, especial ly in the setting of conco mitant symptom s such as nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased appetite . Patients taking medicat ions and/or 
diuretics to m anage their blood pressure (for either hy po-or hy pertensio n) 
shoul d be managed according to standard clinical practice, including 
considerations for dose adjustments of their concomitant medications during the 
course of the trial . Fluid deficit should be corrected before init iation of study  
drug and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydration.
Posteri or Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

shoul d be maintained unt il the condit ion is reversed by control of hypertension 
or other instigati ng factors. 
Transverse Myelitis
One case of transverse myelit is has been reported with MLN9708. It is not 
known whether MLN9708 causes transverse myelitis; however, because it 
happened to a patient receiving MLN9708, the possibilit y that MLN9708 may  
have contributed to transverse myelit is cannot be excluded. Transverse myelit is 
shoul d be managed according to standard medical practice.
Overdose
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of 
investigat ional drug, to or by  a stud y subject, at a dose above that which is 
assigned to that individual subject according to the study  protocol . If overdose 
occurs, consider close observat ion including hospitalizat ion for hem odynamic 
support. Gastric lavage may be considered if inst ituted w ithin 1 hour of ingest ion 
of MLN9708 overdose.

Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus
…
Rash may  range from  somelimited erythematous areas, macular and/or sm all 
papul ar bumps that m ay or m ay not be pruri tic over a few areas of the body , to a 
more generalized eruption that is predominant ly on the trunk or extremit ies. 
Rash has been most commo nly characterized as maculopapular or macular. To 
date, when it d oes occur, rash is most commo nly reported wi thin the fi rst 3 
cycles of therapy . The rash is often transient and self -limit ing and is t ypically 
Grade 1 toor2 in severit y. As in many other oncology  trials, rash m ay occur in 
patients receiving placebo and in patients receiving MLN9708. If rash occurs, 
consideration should be given to alternate causes of the rash such as conco mitant 
medicat ions, infect ions, etc ; these other causative agents should be 
discontinued and alterative agents considered if medically n ecessary .

Rationale for Change :
To add informat ion current ly available around clinical events.
Change 9:Clarifythe procedures for storage, handling, an d accountabilit y.
The primary  change occurs in Section 6.15 Storage, Handling, and Accountabilit y:
Added 
text:On receipt at the invest igative site, study drug should remain in the blister pack 
and carton provided unt il use or dispensat ion. All excursio ns that occur at the 
site storage or during transportation from depot to the site shoul d immediately 
be brought to the sponsor’s attention for assessment and authorizat ion for 
continued use. Ensure that the drug is used before the retest expiry date provided 
by Millennium. Expiry  extensions will be co mmunicated accordingly wit h 
updated documentation to support the extended shelf life.
Study  drug dispensed to the patient should remain in the blister packaging and 
carton until the point of use. Refer to the Pharmacy  Manual or equivale nt storage 
guidelines. In case of extenuating circumstances that prevent a patient from 
attending the study site (eg, the COVID- 19 pandemic), sites may use 
alternative strategies to deliver study drug to patients (eg, via courier or site 
staff), per local standard practice and regulations and with prior approval 
from the investigator and the sponsor’s project clinician/designee. 
Com prehensive instructions should be provided to the patient in order to ensure 
compliance wi th, and understanding of, dosing proc edures. Patients who are 
receiving take -home medicat ion ordinarily shoul d be given only  1 cycle of 
study  drug at a time; more than 1 cy cle of medicat ion may be dispensed on a 
case-
by-case basis for holidays, travel, or other circumstances upon discussio n 
with the invest igator and sponsor project clinician/designee. (Note: patients in 
France are only permitted to receive 1 cycle of medication at a time). Should 
more than 1 cycle of medication be dispensed, the investigator and/or health care 
provi der m ust revi ew the proper dosing instructions with the patient to avoid the 
potenti al for incorrect self -administrati on or overdose of medication. 
Patients shou ld be instructed to store the medicat ion according to the storage 
condi tions that are outlined in the Pharmacy  Manual  or equivalent storage 
guidelines. Pati ents shoul d be instructed to return their empt y cartons to the 
investigat ive site, rather than disca rding them. Reconciliat ion will occur 
accordingly when the patient returns for their next cy cle of  study  drug. In case of 
extenuating circumstances that prevent a patient from attending the study 
site (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), drug packs and dosing diaries should be 
returned at the next available on -site clinic visit. Any extreme in temperature 
shoul d be reported as an excursio n and should be dealt with on a case -by-case 
basis.

In acknowledgement of hospital, local, state or national gover nment 
restrictions, or other site -related factors caused by unavoidable 
circumstances (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic) that may prevent investigators 
from conducting the study according to the Schedule of Events at the 
clinical study site, investigators may con tinue patients in the study despite 
departure from the Schedule of Events. Investigators are expected to 
evaluate the impact to the safety of the study participants and site personnel 
for patients to continue. In evaluating such requests, the investigator/study 
site staff will give the highest priority to the safety and welfare of the 
patients. Patients must be willing and able to continue taking study 
medication and remain compliant with the protocol.  For patients that are 
impacted by these unavoidable ci rcumstances, any procedures not 
conducted per the study protocol will be documented in the eCRF.  
Alternative methods should be considered for performing the assessments 
by other means than the patient presenting to the clinic (eg, remote 
assessment, havi ng lab assessment performed at a facility closer to the 
patient’s home, etc.) If a patient misses an in -person study visit, the 
investigator/study team staff will speak directly with the patient by 
telephone or other medium (eg, a computer -based video comm unication) 
during each visit window to assess subject safety and overall clinical status. 
During this contact with the patient, the study site physician or other 
qualified site staff should at minimum conduct AE collection and an 
assessment of clinical sym ptoms. Other study assessments may be collected 
remotely as is feasible and may involve audio or video recording. 
Assessments/procedures that cannot be completed during the protocol -

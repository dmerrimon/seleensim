 1.0 Introduction and Background  
 
Lung cancer is the third most common cancer in both men and women and the leading 
cause of cancer death.1 Only approximately 15% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at 
the local stage, and 5 -year relative survival rates for regional and distant metast ases are 
a dismal 26.5% and 4%, respectively.1 Systemic therapy is the predominant treatment 
for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), based on clinical trials  
conducted over several decades that demonstrated improved survival and quality of 
life.2-4 However, c urrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for 
patients with Stage IV non -squamous NSCLC and a performance status (PS) of  3 or 4 is 
best supportive care. Restricting treatment based on perf ormance status  is largely based 
on toxicity dat a from historic chemotherapy trials ,5-8 and p revious studies have l imited 
use of the chemotherapy p emetrex ed to patients with PS 0 to 2. G iven the relatively mild  
toxicity profile of pemetrexed ,9, 10 the ability to mitigate side effects with folic acid and 
vitamin B12 supplementation,11 and the reported benefit of single agent pemetrexed in 
elderly patients with good performance status,12, 13 further study of its effectiveness and 
tolerability is warranted i n patients with a PS of 3.  
 
PS is considered an important prognostic factor f or patients with advanced NSCLC.5-8 
The ECOG 1594 trial randomly assigned patients to one of four platinum -based double -
agent chemotherapy regimens : 1) paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) over 24 hours with cisplatin (75 
mg/m2) on a 21 -day cycle; 2) cisplatin (100 mg/m2) with gemcitabine (1 g/m2) on Days 1, 
8, and 15 on a 28 -day cycle; 3) cisplatin (75 mg/m2) with docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2) on a 21 -
day cycle; and 4) paclitaxel (225 mg/m2) over 3 hours with carboplatin (area under the 
curve, 6) .14 The Data Monitoring Committee observed  an excessive rate of adverse 
events among the patients with a PS of 2 and recommended discontinuation of 
enroll ment of patients with a PS of 2. This observation contributed to many cooperative 
groups excluding patients with a PS of 2 from trials that incl uded platinum -based 
therapy. A subsequent analysis of this trial revealed that patients with a PS of 2 had a 
poor prognosis, but the overall rate of treatment -related toxicity was similar among 
patients with a PS of 2 compared with patients with a PS of 0 or 1. Patients with a PS of 
2 compared with patients with a PS of 0 or 1 experienced a higher rate of adverse 
events, but this was because of a higher rate of disease -related adverse events.  
 
Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate agent that has been app roved for use in locally 
advanced or metastatic non -squamous non -small cell lung cancer as initial treatment in 
combination with cisplatin, as maintenance treatment of patients whose disease has not 
progressed after four cycles of platinum -based first -line chemotherapy, and after prior 
chemotherapy as a single -agent.10 The primary adverse effect of pemetrexed, 
myelosuppression, presents as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and is t he dose -
limiting toxicity of the drug. Elevated pretreatment levels of p lasma homocysteine  (a 
marker of folate deficiency) has been shown to be predictive of  severe 
myelosuppression , while a high pretreatment level of methylmalonic acid (a marker of 
vitamin B12 deficiency) is an independent predictor of severe diarrhea and mucositis.11 It 
has been reported that supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 substantially 
reduces peme trexed -related toxicity without reducing efficacy.11 In Scagliotti et al’s 
Phase III, the key hematologic grade 3 or 4 drug -related toxicities for 
cisplatin/pemetrexed were significantly lower than those in cisplatin/gemcitabine

 (neutropenia: 15% versus 27% , anemia: 6% versus 10%, and thrombocytopenia: 4% 
versus 13%, respectively; P<0.001).15 Drug -related grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia (1% 
versus 4%, respectively; P<0.002) and alopecia (all grades, 12% versus 21%, 
respectively; P<0.001) were also significantly lower.15 
 
Clinical trials evaluating use of pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC and a PS ≥2 are 
limited to a  study by Jung et al.  that retrospectively  examined pemetrexed  use in 56 
Korean patients with NSCLC and  PS ≥2 who had relapsed or progr essed after prior 
chemotherapy treatment.16 Anemia was the most frequent adverse event (28.4%), 
followed by nausea (23%). Grade 3 -4 hemat ologic toxicity occurred in 8.8% of cases. 
None of the patients required dose modifications due to toxicity.  Non-squamous cell 
carcinoma histology was significantly associated with a superior response rate (P=0.045) 
and disease control rate (P=0.008). The median survival time and the median 
progression free survival (PFS) time were 6.11 month s and 2.17 months, respectively. 
Studies considering advanced age are available, such as the  randomized phase II trial 
by Gridelli et al. evaluating single -agent pemetr exed versus sequential 
pemetrexed/gemcitabine in patients with NSCLC and PS of 0 to 2 who were ineligible for 
platinum -based chemotherapy . This study found that  single -agent pemetrexed 
demonstrated moderate activity and was well tolerated , regardless of ad vanced age.13 
Similarly, in a single -arm phase II study of pemetrexed in elderly ( ≥70 years old) 
Japanese patients with advanced non -squamous NSCLC demonstrated favorable 
antitumor activity and mild toxicity.17  In an analysis of two randomized phase III trials 
evaluating the survival and safety of pemetrexed in elderly patients (<65 years and ≥65 
years, and <70 years and ≥70 years) with nonsquamous NSCLC and PS 0 -1, Gridelli et 
al found minimal variation in the hematol ogic toxicities between the age groups, and the 
majority of hematologic toxicity rates were low.12  
 
The primary endpoint of this single arm pilot study is to evaluate the effect of single 
agent pemetrexed chemotherapy in ECOG Performance Status 3 patients with stage IV 
non-squamous histology non -small cell lung cancer. We hypothesize that patients with 
non-squamous histology NSCLC and ECOG PS 3 rec eiving single agent pemetrexed 
chemotherapy will have a prolonged time to progression compared to best supportive 
care alone and will have improved quality of l ife (QOL) as measured by the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 
version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ -C30) and the corresponding lung cancer -specific module 
(QLQ -LC13).18

 2.2 Secondary Objective  
2.2.1  To evaluate toxicity associated with single agent pemetrexed on tumor 
progression in ECOG Performance Status 3 patients with Stage IV non -
squamous histology non -small cell lung cancer in a single arm pilot study . 
3.0 Patient Selection  
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria   
 
3.1.1  Patients must have histologically confirmed Stage IV non -squamous 
histology non -small cell lung cancer  
 
3.1.2  ECOG  performance status  of 3 
 
3.1.3  Sensitizing EGFR , ALK and ROS -1 mutations are either  negative or 
unknown  
 
3.1.4  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:  
 
- absolute neutrophil count   >1,500/mcL  
- platelets       >100,000/mcL  
- creatinine clearance    >45 mL/min  
 
3.1.5  The effects of pemetrexed on the developing human fetus are unknown.  
For this reason and because Pregnancy Category D  agents are known to 
be teratogenic, women of child -bearing potential and men must agree to 
use adequat e contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; 
abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. 
Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while 
participating in this study, she should inform her t reating physician 
immediately.  
 
3.1.6  Ability to understand and t he willingness to sign an IRB -approved  
informed consent document   
 
3.1.7  Ability to understand and complete the EORTC QOL instruments  
 
3.1.8  ≥18 years of age  
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria   
 
3.2.1  Patients who have previously received  chemotherapy  for non -small cell 
lung cancer , or have received radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to 
entering the study , or who have not recovered from adverse events due 
to treatment  more than 2 weeks earlier.

3.2.2  Patients who se tumors  are positive fo r the sensitizing EGFR  mutation.  
 
3.2.3  Patients who se tumors  are positive for the sensitizing  ALK fusion  
 
3.2.4  Patients whose tumors are positive for the sensitizing ROS -1 fusion  
 
3.2.5  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.  
 
3.2.6  Patients with symptomatic or recurrent  brain metastases should be 
excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and 
because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that 
would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse event s. 
 
3.2.7   Patients whose pathology has squamous cell features unless there is an 
unequivocal determination of non -squamous pathology.  
 
3.2.8  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or 
biologic composition to pemetrexed . 
 
3.2.9  Pregnant wom en are excluded from this study because pemetrexed  is a 
Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. 
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in 
nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pemetrexed , 
breas tfeeding should be discontinued . 
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
Men and women of all races and ethnicities who meet the above -described 
eligibility criteria are eligible to participate in this study.  
 
The study consent  form will also be provided in Spanish for Spanish -speaking 
participants.  Based on CCCWFU population esti mates for lung cancer patients, 
we expect approximately 40 % of participants to be women. Translating this to our 
sample size estimate of 30 patients , we anticipate enrolling at least 12 women. 
Similarly, we expect approximately 4% of study participants to be Hispanic/Latino 
(N=1). We anticipate enrolling  18% Black or African American (N= 5) patients.  
For other minority groups (American Indian, Asian) we anticipate enrolling 
approximately 4% (N=1) patient.  Should we not meet or exceed these estimates, 
the PI will engage the Cancer Center Health Equity Advisory Group to discuss 
strategies to enhance recruitment in these target populations.

 6.2.3  Performance status  and QOL  
  
ECOG per formance status and QOL will be  assessed at the start of every 
cycle  (i.e. every 3 weeks) . QOL will be assessed by the EORTC QLQ -
C30 and QLQ -LC13.18 
 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is reportedly the most frequently used QOL 
instrument in lung cancer clinical trials.19 The QLQ -30 is a 30 -item multi -
dimensional questionnaire designed for use in cancer populations.18 It 
contains nine multi -item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, 
cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, 
and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality -of-life scale , 
requested by 4 -point Likert or visua l analogue scales . Several single -item 
symptom measures are also included . The QLQ -LC13 is a lung cancer -
specific module to be used in conjunction with the QLQ -30 and is 13 
additional items. These questionnaires  have been shown to be reliable 
and valid in over 60 languages,  can be self - or interviewer -administered 
and take approximately 11 minutes to complete.18, 19 
6.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care 
Guidelines  
 
Patients should receive full supportive care , including transfusions of blood and 
blood products, erythropoietin, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc., as clinically 
indicated . Medications considered necessary for the patient's well -being may be 
given at the discretion of the investigator, i.e., chronic t reatments for concomitant 
medical conditions, as well as agents required for life -threatening medical 
problems, etc. The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and dates of treatment 
should be recorded on the flow sheets.  
 
6.4 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence  of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may 
continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Disease progression,  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  including hematologic or nonhematologic 
Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 
neurotoxicity is observed  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the  patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

 6.5 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed  for adverse events monitoring  for a minimum of 30 days 
after the  last study drug is administered or until death, whichev er occurs first . 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed 
until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.   
 
Patients will be followed every 6 weeks  until death for monitoring survival study 
endpoints.  
7.0 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
 
Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir 
hematologic counts or maximum  nonhematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of 
therapy. Treatment may be delay ed to allow sufficient time for recover y. Upon recovery, 
patients should be retreated using the guidelines in Tables 1 -3. Patients should be 
removed from study if they have not fully recovered with respect to treatment related 
toxicity more than 6 weeks after the last treatment, i.e. a >3 week delay.  
 
Table 1: Dose reduction – Hematologic Toxicities  
Nadir ANC<500 mm3 and nadir platelets ≥50,000/mm3 75% of previous dose  
Nadir platelets <50,000/mm3 without bleeding 
regardless of nadir ANC  75% of previous dose  
Nadir platelets <50,000/mm3 with bleedinga regardless 
of nadir ANC  50% of previous dose  
aThese criteria meet the CTC version 2.0 (NCI 1998) definition of ≥CTC Grade 2 bleeding  
 
If patients develop non -hematologic toxicities (excluding neurotoxicity) ≥Grade 3, 
treatment should be withheld until  resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s pre -
therapy value. Treatment should be resumed according to guidelines in  Table 2.  Patients 
should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is experienced.

 8.0 Measurement of Effect  
8.1 Antitumor Effect  
 
As part of normal medical care, patients should be reevaluated for response 
every 6 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be 
obtained after approximately 6 weeks to monitor for disease progression. Scans 
will be done indepen dently of the study, however data acquired from the scans 
will be used for research purpose to evaluate the effects of the product under 
investigation. For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated for 
response every  6 weeks  (+/- 2 weeks) . In addition to a baseline scan, 
confirmatory scans should also be obtained 6 weeks  (+/- 2 weeks) following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Sol id Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1.20 
8.1.1 Definitions  
   
 Evaluable for toxicity : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the 
time of their first treatment with pemetrexed  
 Inevaluable for objective response : When no imaging/measurement is 
done at all  at a particular time point, the patient is not  evaluable (NE) at 
that time point.  
o If only a subset of lesion measurements are  made at an 
assessment, usually the case is  also considered NE at that time 
point, unless  a convincing argument can be made that the  
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s)  would not change 
the assigned time point  response. This would most likely happen 
in the case of PD.  
 Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one  dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of  measurement is to be recorded) with a  minimum size of:   
o 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 
mm; when CT scans have  slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum 
size shoul d be twice the slice thickness);  
o 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical  exam (lesions which 
cannot be accurately  measured with calipers should be recorded  
as non -measurable).  
o 20 mm by chest X -ray. 
 Measurable lesions:  
o Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged  
and measurable, a lymph node must be  ≥15 mm in short axis 
when assessed  by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness is  
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in 
follow -up, only the short  axis will be measured and followed.  
o Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic  lesions with identifiable 
soft tissue  compon ents that can be evaluated by crosssectional  
A Pilot Study Evaluating Pemetrexed in ECOG Performance Status 3 Patients with Stage IV

CCCWFU # 62115  
 
Protocol version date 04 -13-17  Page 16 of 45 
 imaging techniques such as CT or  MRI can be considered 
measurable if the  soft tissue component meets the definition  of 
measurability described above.  
o ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic  metastases can b e 
considered measurable  if they meet the definition of measurability  
described above. However, if non -cystic  lesions are present in the 
same patient,  these are preferred for selection as  target lesions.  
 Non-measurable lesions : Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions,  
including small lesions (longest diameter  <10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with  10 to <15 mm short axis), as well as truly  non-measurable 
lesions. Lesions considered  truly non -measurable include: 
leptomeningeal  disease, ascites, pleura l or pericardial effusion,  
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic  involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal  masses/abdominal organomegaly identified  by physical exam 
that is not measurable by  reproducible imaging techniques.  
o Lesions with prior local treatment, such  as those situated in a 
previously irradiated  area or in an area subjected to other  loco-
regional therapy, are usually not  considered measurable unless 
there has  been demonstrated progression in the  lesion.  
 Target lesions : All measurable le sions up to a maximum  of two lesions 
per organ and five lesions in  total, representative of all involved organs,  
should be identified as target lesions and recorded  and measured at 
baseline.  
o Target lesions should be selected on the  basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest  diameter) and be representative of all  
involved organs, as well as their suitability  for reproducible 
repeated measurements.  
o All measurements should be recorded in  metric notation using 
calipers if clinically  assessed.  
o A sum of the di ameters (longest for non -nodal  lesions, short axis 
for nodal lesions) for all  target lesions will be calculated and 
reported  as the baseline sum diameters, which will be  used as 
reference to further characterize any  objective tumor regressio n in 
the measur able dimension of the disease. If lymph nodes  are to 
be included in the sum, only the  short axis will contribute.  
o Lymph nodes identified as target lesions  should always have the 
actual short axis  measurement recorded even if the nodes  regress 
to below 10 m m on study. When  lymph nodes are included as 
target lesions,  the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even  if 
complete response criteria are met since  a normal lymph node is 
defined as having  a short axis of <10 mm.  
o Target lesions that become ‘too small to  measure’:  While on 
study, all lesions (nodal  and non -nodal) recorded at baseline 
should  have their actual measurements recorded  at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when  very small. However, 
sometimes lesions or  lymph nodes become so faint on a CT scan  
that the radiologist may not feel comfortable  assigning an exact

 measure and may report  them as being ‘too small to measure’, in  
which case a default value of 5 mm should  be assigned.  
o Lesions that  split or coalesce on treatment: When non -nodal 
lesions ‘fragme nt’, the longest diameters of the fragmented  
portions should be added together to  calculate the target lesion 
sum. Similarly,  as lesions coalesce, a plane between  them may be 
maintained that would aid in  obtaining maximal diameter 
measurements  of each indi vidual lesion. If the lesions  have truly 
coalesced such that they are  no longer separable, the v ector of 
the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal 
longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
 Non-target lesions: All lesions (or sites of d isease) not identified  as target 
lesions, including pathological lymph  nodes and all non -measurable 
lesions, should  be identified as non -target lesions and be  recorded at 
baseline. Measurements of these  lesions are not required and they 
should be  followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases,  ‘unequivocal 
progression’.  
8.1.2  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
  
The same me thod of assessment and the same technique should be 
used to characterize each  identified and repo rted lesion at baseline and 
during follow -up. 
 
 CT is the best currently available and reprod ucible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment. MRI  is also acceptable in 
certain situations  (e.g., for body scans but not for lung).  
 Lesions on a chest X -ray may be considered  measurable lesions if they 
are clearly  defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is 
preferable.  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered  measurable when they are 
superficial and  ≥10 mm in diameter as assessed using  calipers. For the 
case of skin lesions,  documentation by color photography,  including a 
ruler to estimate the size of  the lesion, is recommended.  
 Ultrasound (US) should not be used to  measure tumor lesions.  
 Tumor markers alone cannot be used to  assess res ponse. If markers are 
initially  above the upper normal limit, they must  normalize for a patient to 
be considered in  complete response.  
 Cytology and histology can be used in rare  cases (e.g., for evaluation of 
residual  masses to differentiate between Partial  Response and Complete 
Response or  evaluation of new or enlarging effusions to  differentiate 
between Progressive Disease  and Response/Stable Disease).  
 Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy is not  advised. However, they can be 
used to  confirm complete pathological response.

 8.1.3  Response Criteria  
 
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions . Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm  
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% d ecrease in the sum of diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters  
 Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of 
diameters  of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
(this may inclu de the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD . 
8.1.4  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
 Complete Response ( CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and  
normalization  of tumor marker levels. All  lymph nodes must be non -
pathological in  size (<10 mm short axis).  
 Non-CR / Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target  lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker  levels above normal limits.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target  
lesions.  
o When  patient has measurable disease: To achieve ‘unequivocal 
progression’ on the basis of the non -target disease, there must  be an 
overal l level of substantial worsening in non -target disease such that, 
even in  presence of SD or PR in target disease,  the overall tumor 
burden has increased  sufficiently to merit discontinuation of  therapy. A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size  of one or more non -target lesions is  
usually not sufficient to qualify for  unequivocal progression status.  
o When patient has only non -measurable  disease: There is no 
measurable disease  assessment to factor into the interpretation  of an 
increase in non -measurable disease  burden. Because worsening in 
non-target  disease cannot be easily quantified, a useful  test that can 
be applied is to consider if the  increase in overall disease burden 
based  on change in non -measurable disease is  comparable in 
magnitude to the increase  that would be required to declare PD for  
measurable disease. Examples include an  increase in a pleural 
effusion from ‘trace’  to ‘large’ or an increase in lymphangitic  disease 
from localized to widespread.  
 New lesions : The appearance of new malignant lesions  denotes d isease 
progression.  
o The finding of a new lesion should be  unequivocal (i.e., not 
attributable to  differences in scanning technique, change  in imaging 
modality or findings thought  to represent something other than tumor,  
especially when the patient’s baseli ne lesions show partial or 
complete response).

CCCWFU # 62115  
 
Protocol version date 04 -13-17  Page 19 of 45 
 o If a new lesion is equivocal, for example  because of its small size, 
continued therapy  and follow -up evaluation will clarify if it  represents 
truly new disease. If repeat  scans confirm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be declared  using the date of the 
initial scan.  
o A lesion identified on a follow -up study in  an anatomical location that 
was not scanned  at baseline is considered a new lesion and  disease 
progression.  
o It is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the  use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT  in assessment of progression 
(particularly  possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the  basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified  according to the following 
algorithm:  
 Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET a t 
follow -up is PD based on a new lesion.  
 No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive  FDG -PET at follow -
up: 
 If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
new site of disease  confirmed by CT, this is PD.  
 If the positiv e FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed 
as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT 
scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD 
will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan) . 
 If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of  disease on CT that is not 
progressing  on the basis of the anatomic  images, this 
is not PD.  
 
8.1.5  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
Appendix I  provides a summary of the overall response status  calculation at each 
time point for patie nts who have measurable  and non -measurable (therefore non -
target)  disease at baseline.  
 
8.1.6  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of over all response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first 
recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest  
measurements recorded on study).  
 
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease 
is objectively documented.

Protocol version date 04 -13-17  Page 20 of 45 
 Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
8.1.7  Survival  Outcomes  
 
Progression -Free Survival is defined as the duration of time from the start of 
treatment to the time of progression , death, or date of last contact  
 
Overall Survival is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to 
date of death or date of last contact .

9.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer .gov). 
 
 ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ (see Section 7.1 
above) for expedited reporting purposes only.

9.3 STRC  SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
The Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs 
for CCCWFU Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix B. STRC  currently requires 
that all unexpected 4 and  all grade  5 SAEs on these trials be reported to them for 
review. All CCCWFU Clinical Research Management (CRM) s taff members assisting a 
Principal Investigator  in investigating, documenting and reporting an SAE qualifying for 
STRC  reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC as well as 
the entir e committee via the email notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.  
9.4  WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events 
shall be promptly reported to the IRB , according to  institutional policy . Reporting to the 
IRB is required regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, or whether the event 
involves an investigational or marketed drug, biologic or device. Reportable events are 
not limited to physical injury, but includ e psychological, economic and social harm.  
Reportable events may arise as a result of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures 
or other interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other 
interactions with research subjects . 
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the 
IRB and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or 
others. The Principal Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ens uring the 
prompt reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the 
IRB. The Principal Investigator is also responsible for ensuring that all reported 
unanticipated risks to subjects and others which they receive are reviewed t o determine 
whether the report represents a change in the risks and/or benefits to study participants, 
and whether any changes in the informed consent, protocol or other study -related 
documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to s ubjects or others occurring at a site 
where the study has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (internal events) must be 
reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members 
of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any una nticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at another site 
conducting the same study that has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (external 
events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator 
or other me mbers of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outcome that alters the risk versus potential benefit 
of the research and as a result warrants a substantive change in the research protocol or

10.0 Pharmaceutical Information  
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the pharmaceutical agent  
administered in this study can be found in Section  9.1. 
10.1 Pharmaceutical Accountability  
 
This drug is commercially available.  
10.2 ALIMTA (Pemetrexed)   
  
Product description :  Pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate has the chemical 
name L -Glutamic acid, N-[4-[2-(2-amino -4,7-dihydro -4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3 -
d]pyrimidin -5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl] -, disodium salt, heptahydrate. It is marketed by 
Lilly USA, LLC. ALIMTA is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder for 
intravenous infusion available in single -dose vials. The product is a white to 
either light yellow or gre en-yellow lyophilized solid. Each 100 -mg or 500 -mg vial 
of ALIMTA contains pemetrexed disodium equivalent to 100 mg pemetrexed and 
106 mg mannitol or 500 mg pemetrexed and 500 mg mannitol, respectively. 
Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have be en added to adjust pH.  
 
Solution preparation : Reconstitute each 500 -mg vial with 20 mL of 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free). Reconstitution gives a solution 
containing 25 mg/mL ALIMTA. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is 
completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and ranges in color from 
colorless to yellow or green -yellow without adversely affecting product quality. 
The pH of the reconstituted ALIMTA solution is between 6.6 and 7.8.  
FURTHER DILUTION IS REQUIRED.  Reconstituted ALIMTA solution must be 
further diluted into a solution  of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative 
free), so that the total volume of solution is 100 ml.  Reconstitution and further 
dilution prior to intravenous infusion is only recomm ende d with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection (preservative free). ALIMTA is physically incompatible with 
diluents containing calcium, including Lactated  Ringer’s Injection, USP and 
Ringer’s Injection, USP and therefore these should not be used. 
Coadministration o f ALIMTA  with other drugs and diluents has not been studied, 
and therefore is not recommended.  
 
Storage requirements  and Stability : Chemical and physical stability of 
reconstituted and i nfusion solutions of ALIMTA have been  demonstrated for up to  
24 hours following initial reconstitution, when stored refrigerated. When prepared 
as directed, reconstitution and infusion solutions of ALIMTA contain no 
antimicrobial preservatives. Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15 -
30°C (59 -86°F) . Discard any unus ed portion.

 Route of administration:   ALIMTA is administered as an intravenous infusion 
over 10 minutes. . As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should 
be exercised in the handling and preparation of infusion solutions of ALIMTA. 
The use  of gloves is recommended. If a solution of ALIMTA c ontacts the skin, 
wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If ALIMTA 
contacts the mucous m embranes, flush thoroughly with water.  ALIMTA is 
compatible with  standard polyvinyl chloride (PVC) administration sets and 
intravenous solution bags.  ALIMTA is not a vesicant. There is no specific antidote 
for extravasation of ALIMTA. To date, there have been few  reported cases of 
ALIMTA extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. 
ALIMTA extravasation  should be managed with local standard practice for 
extravasation as with other non -vesicants.  
 
Drug interactions:  
Non-Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)  
Although ibuprofen (400 mg four times a day) can decrease t he clearance of 
pemetrexed, it can be administered with ALIMTA in patients with normal renal 
function (creatinine clearance ≥80 mL/min). No dose adjustment of ALIMTA is 
needed with concomitant NSAIDs in pati ents with normal renal function.  Caution 
should b e used when administering NSAIDs concurrently with ALIMTA to 
patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 
79 mL/min).  NSAIDs with short elimination half -lives (e.g., diclofenac, 
indomethacin) should be avoided for a p eriod of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 
days following administration of ALIMTA.  In the absence of data regarding 
potential interaction between ALIMTA and NSAIDs with longer half -lives (e.g.,  
meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should in terrupt dosing 
for at least 5 days before, the day of, and  2 days following ALIMTA 
administration. If concomitant administration of NSAIDs is necessary, patients 
should be  monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression, renal, and 
gastrointest inal toxicity.  
 
Nephrotoxic Drugs  
ALIMTA is primarily eliminated unchanged renally as a result of glomerular 
filtration and tubular secretion.  Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs 
could result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA. Concomitant administ ration  of 
substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid) could potentially 
result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA.  
 
Disposal:   Unused por tions of agent should be  disposed of in accordance with

12.0 Statistical Considerations  
12.1 Analysis of Primary Objective s 
 
There are two primary objectives in this study: 1) To evaluate the effect of single 
agent pemetrexed on tumor progression in ECOG Performance Status 3 patients 
with Stage IV non -squamous histology non -small cell lung cancer  and 2) To 
evaluate the effect of single agent pemetrexed on quality of life in ECOG 
Performance Status 3 patients with Stage IV non -squamous histology non -small 
cell lung ca ncer. 
 
Both of these objectives will be examined using a pilot study of 30 patients.  We 
now will describe the analytic strategy to address each aim.  
 
Based on historic data, the median progression free survival time for comparable 
patients has ranged from  2.8 to  4.9 months .17, 21-23  However, the patients in this 
protocol are likely to have a worse prognosis  since their ECOG performance  status 
is 3 whereas the patients in the references had better ECOG performance status.  
Therefore, one goal of this trial is to see whether the re is evidence that the  median 
progression free survival time in this group of treated patients could be  12 weeks 
(i.e., 2.8 months) .   In order to do this we will determine whether each patient has a  
progression  (or dies)  before or after 12 weeks .  We will then construct a 95% exact 
(Clopper Pearson) confidence interval around the proportion with PFS greater than 
or equal to 12 weeks .  If this confidence interval includes 50% then that would 
provide e vidence that the therapy is potentially promising.  However, if the upper 
bound of the confidence interval does not include 50% then this would indicate that 
the treatment may not be promising for patients  since we could rule out the 
possibility that the m edian PFS is 12 weeks  or longer .   We have designed this 
study to enroll 30 patients.  If 9 out of 30 do not have a progression  (or dies)  at 12 
weeks  (30%) then the upper bound of a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval would not 
include 50%, however if 10 or more patients (out of 30)  do not  have progression  (or 
dies)  at 12 weeks  then the upper bound would include 50% suggesting that the 
treatment is promisi ng.

Protocol version date 04 -13-17  Page 25 of 45 
 In addition to estimating this confidence interval  we will construct a Kaplan Meier 
survival curve to describe the time to progression data.  
 
For the quality of life outcome we wish to compare the pre -treatment with the post -
treatment values over time.  Quality of life will be assessed every 3 -weeks during 
the trial and we anticipate examining each of these assessments.  For the purposes 
of iden tifying a primary time point for comparison we will compare the 12 week QOL 
value with the baseline QOL value.   Since some patients may not have a 12 week 
measure, but we will assess QOL at each treatment time (i.e. every three weeks) 
we can use a longitu dinal mixed models analysis to look at QOL over the time 
course.   This approach would handle missing data if the data is missing at random, 
which means that measured covariates can be used to predict whether missing 
data will occur.   We believe that it i s possible that patients who have worse 
baseline co -morbid conditions may be more likely to have a 12 -week QOL missing, 
and thus we will use these characteristics in the longitudinal mixed model analysis 
to examine change in QOL over time adjusting for bas eline covariates. Based on 
historic data, most patients eligible for this study would have worsening QOL over a 
12 week period, thus we wish to determine whether QOL can remain stable or 
possibly improve.   To do this we will calculate a paired t -test to s ee if the average 
change is more than 0 (worsening) versus a two-sided alternative that the 
difference is 0 or better.  
 
It should be noted that since this is a pilot study, there is a possibility that one of the 
two primary comparisons (confidence interval  calculation and QOL change) may 
not meet the criteria for success, however if there is evidence that the effects are 
trending in the correct direction (i..e, if the average change in 12 week QOL is 0 or 
positive (implying some improvement) ) then this woul d provide evidence that the 
treatment regimen is possibly working and could possibly warrant further studies.   
12.2 Analysis of Secondary Objective s 
 
There are three secondary objectives in this protocol 1) to evaluate the toxicities 
associated with single agent pemetrexed on tumor progression in ECOG 
Performance Status 3 patients with Stage IV non -squamous histology non -small 
cell lung cancer  (in particular we will examine neutropenia, thrombocytopenia 
and fatigue (although fatigue will also be captured as par t of quality of life 
assessment) , 2) to estimate the res ponse rate in ECOG Performance Status 3 
patients with Stage IV non -squamous histology non -small cell lung cancer 
receiving single agent pemetrexed and  3) to estimate the o verall survival in 
ECOG Perfo rmance Status 3 patients with Stage IV non -squamous histology 
non-small cell lung cancer receiving single agent pemetrexed  
 
For toxicities we will estimate the number and type of toxicities observed during 
this protocol focusing on unexpected grade 3 or hi gher toxicities.  No formal 
statistical tests will be done on these estimates.  
 
Response rate will be estimate every 6 weeks for patients and these estimates 
will be presented with confidence intervals as well.

 Overall survival will be examined by estimat ing a Kaplan -Meier survival curve 
using all patients enrolled.  
   
12.3 Power and Sample Size  
 
Since this is an aggressive disease and patients enrolled will be at ECOG 
Performance Status 3, it is an expected that all patients will progress or die prior 
to the end of the follow -up therefore we anticipate that all 30 patients will provide 
data for the time until progression end point analysis. .  Quality of life will be 
measured at each visit when treatment is administered so it is expected that all 
patients will have some follow -up assessments to be used in analyses.  
 
As described above, the first analysis will consist of determ ining what proportion 
of patients are  progression -free (and alive) at 12 weeks  (yes/no).   With a total of 
30 patients, a two -sided 95% confidence interval (using the Clopper -Pearson 
exact calculation) will have a maximum width of 0.374 (i.e., +/ - 0.187).  Thus, if 
the observed proportion of patients who are progression free at 12 weeks  is 50% 
then the lower bound of this interval will rule out 31.3% (or lower).   Likewise, if 
30% or fewer patients are progression free at 12 weeks  then the upper bound of 
this confidence interval will rule out 50% and thus suggest that the median 
progression free survival for this treatment is less than 12 weeks . 
 
We have a planned interim analysis to take place after the first 15 patients are 
enrolled and have had more than 12 weeks  of follow -up.  If 2 or fewer of these 
first 15 patients have a response (i..e progress by 12 weeks ) then we will stop 
the trial since the upper bound of a 2 -sided 99% exact confidence interval would 
rule out 50%.  
 
Likewise, with 30 patients enrolled, we have 80% power to detect a change in 
QOL equal to 0.53 standard deviations using a paired t -test with alpha=0.05 (2 -
sided test).  
 
As stated above, since this is a pilot study, it is possible that we may not observe 
statistical significance for  these two aims, however if the point estimates for these 
aims are in the correct direction this will provide evidence that the therapy may 
be a promising alternative for patients and thus warrant further investigation.  If 
this were to occur, the data fro m this trial would be used to provide preliminary 
estimates of what PFS rates may be expected and what change in QOL may be 
expected in a larger efficacy study.  
12.4 Estimated Accrual Rate  
 
We anticipate that there will be many patients eligible for this t rial since this 
population does not have many treatment options, thus we expect 2 -3 patients a 
month and accrual would be finished between 10 -15 months.

 12.5 Estimated Study Length  
 
Since this is an aggressive disease we anticipate that within 1 -year of follow -up 
of the last enrolled patient we will have sufficient data to perform all analyses.  
Thus, we anticipate that the length of this study will be between 22 and 27 
months.  
12.6 Interim Analysis Plan  
 
As described above an interim analysis will take p lace after 1 5 patients have 
been enrolled and have sufficient follow -up to determine whether their 
progression free survival time is above 2.8 months or not.

 Appendix C – Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Guidelines  
 
Mandatory Safety and Toxicity Review Committee ( STRC; Previously CROC)  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Notification Procedure  
 
Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements – Revised 6/05/2012  
 
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) 
SAEs on CCCWFU Institutional interventional tri al patients . There are multiple entities that 
require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and how it is 
reported.  
 
Rules used by other entities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, etc.) 
should NOT be u sed to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules 
for reporting described in this document should be considered.  
 
As defined in the NCI summary IV reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional studies 
covered by these reporting requi rements are defined as: In-house, internally reviewed 
trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorship in 
which the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, and monitoring 
of the trial, or participatio n in a multi -site trial initiated by an institutional investigator at 
another center.   Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher here at 
CCCWFU. Institutional protocols are labeled NCI  Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol 
screen in ORIS. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research 
Base trials are classified as Institutional.  
 
The STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional studies , as defined 
above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials 
be reported to them for review. All Clinical Research Management (CRM) staff members 
assisting a PI in documenting and reporting an SAE that qualifies for STRC reporting are 
responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC by phone, followed by informing the 
entire committee via the required email notification.  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO EVERYONE WORKING WITH CANCER 
CENTER INSTITUTIONA L PROTOCOLS.  
 
What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure?  
Any unexpected grade 4  event not including routinely experienced events per protocol (e.g. 
myelosuppression) and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) should be 
repor ted. The patient is considered “on -treatment” as defined in the protocol, which can extend 
days/weeks/months past the last date of actual protocol intervention.

STRC reporting may not be appropriate for specific expected adverse events for protocols. In those 
situations the adverse events that will not require STRC reporting must be specified in the text of 
the approved protocol.  
 
STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
 
1. Make a phone call to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as listed below (page if 
necessary) —see note 2 below  
2. Submit the STRC Notification Form WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the event. This 
form is found at either the ORIS main menu page or by going to

The Clinical Members of STRC to Notify by Phone or Page:  
 
 Bayard Powell, MD  – Director -at-Large, CCCWFU; Chair, PRC; Section Head, 
Hematology/Oncology.  6 -7970 / 6 -2701 / Pager 806 -9308  
 Glenn L esser, MD – Hematology Oncology 6 -9527 / 6 -0256 / Pager 806 -8397  
 Kathryn Greven, MD  – Vice Chair – Radiation Oncology. 3 -3600 / Pager 806 -8314  
 Marissa Howard -McNatt, MD  – General Surgery 6 -0545 / 806 -6438  
 
Definition of Unavailable:  As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contacted does not 
respond to the phone call or page within a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact with their 
backup.  Give the back -up a reasonable amount of time to respond to a phone call or page before 
contact ing another member. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a 
clinical research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as 
to when it is appropriate to contact backup clinicians.  If the eve nt occurs near the end of day, then 
leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC notification 
form.  The important criteria is that have taken reasonable steps to notify and document that you 
have initiated some type  of contact to one or more of the clinical members of STRC.  
 
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:   It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all 
reported events, evaluate the events as they are reported; and communicate a response to the 
Investigat or, event reporter and the members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to 
the information reported; there may be times when additional information is needed in order for an 
assessment to be made further communication directly with the inves tigator may be warranted. 
STRC reserves the right to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the 
investigator STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investigation.  
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS :  If you are not able to supply all pertinent information 
with the initial submission, once the additional information is available do not submit a new report . 
Go to the original email that was received by STRC and others “reply to all” and entitle your email 
“Amen dment for (list date of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same event. List 
the additional information which you are reporting.

Evaluation of target lesions  
 
   Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions . Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm  
 
   Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter 
(LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
 
   Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started 
or the appearance of one or more new lesions  (this may include the baseline sum). The 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
 
   Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qual ify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 
Evaluation of non -target lesions  
 
   Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level . All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size 
(<10 mm short axis).  
 
   Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/an d 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits . 
 
   Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions . 
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or study chair).

Evaluation of Best Overall R esponse  
 
The best ove rall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best 
response assig nment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria (see section 9.4.1).

Protocol version date 04 -13-17      Page 47 of 45    Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions . Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm  
 
   Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter 
(LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD

   Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qual ify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be cla ssified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances, it may be difficult 
to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When t he evaluation of complete response 
depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine 
needle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.  
 
 
Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response  
 
Confirmation: confirmatory scans should also be obtained 6 weeks following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the 
first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The duration of overall CR is m easured from the time measurement 
criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented.  
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progressio n are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started.

Protocol  synopsis  
Title of study : A Phase IV, Randomized,  Double- Blind,  Placebo- Controlled Exploratory  Study  of Xolair  
(Omalizumab)  for Treatment  of Idiopathic  Angioedema in Patients  Who  Remain  Symptomatic  Despite  
Current  Therapy  
Purpose  and rationale : The overall  hospitalizations  for a diagnosis  of angioedema doubled from the 
year 2000 to 2009.  Although some  of the cases represented hereditary  angioedema or ace-inhibitor  
induced angioedema,  the majority  of episodes  were  idiopathic.  Idiopathic  Angioedema (IAE)  can be life- 
threatening especially  when  affecting  tissues  within  the respiratory  tract.  No clear  guidelines  exist for 
management  of this important  condition for clinicians.  Current  therapies  typically  include  avoidance of 
potential  triggers  and use of medications  either  for prophylaxis  or for acute events,  such  as 
antihistamines,  corticosteroids,  and epinephrine.  There  remains  a critical need for therapeutic  options  to 
provide more  effective  prophylaxis.  
 
Objectives:  
Primary  objective:  To estimate  the effect  of omalizumab  in reducing the severity  of angioedema  
episodes  in patients  with IAE. 
Secondary  objectives:  
To estimate  the effect  of omalizumab  in improving  quality  of life in IAE subjects.  
To estimate  the effect  of omalizumab  in reducing frequency,  duration of angioedema  
episodes,  need for rescue medication/corticosteroids,  and need for unscheduled  
clinic/urgent  care/ER  visits.  
To assess  the safety  of omalizumab  usage in patients  with IAE. 
To assess  the effect  of omalizumab on biomarkers  previously  implicated  in the pathogenesis  
of IAE. 
 
 
Population:  Forty  adults  (age 18 or older)  with 2 or more  episodes  of Idiopathic  Angioedema (IAE)  in the 
past 6 months,  despite current  therapy  will enter  the treatment  period.  
 
 
Inclusion/Exclusion  criteria : 
Inclusion criteria  
1) Adults  or adolescents  who are 18 years  or older  with physician diagnosis  of IAE. 
2) Minimum of two episodes  of IAE in the past 6 months.  
3) Management  with a stable treatment  plan for the prior 6 months.  
4) Complement  profile  (C1 Esterase inhibitor  panel)  within  normal  reference values.  
5) If a woman is of child-bearing potential,  she must  agree to a reliable form of birth control  
including:  abstinence,  oral contraceptives  (birth  control  pills),  Depo -provera,  an IUD (intrauterine  
device),  or double- barrier  contraception (partner  using condom  and subject  using diaphragm,  
contraceptive sponge or cervical  cap, and spermicidal).  
7 
  
Exclusion  criteria  
1) Diagnosis  of HAE,  Acquired Angioedema,  or Ace-inhibitor  associated angioedema,  which  are 
forms  of angioedema with known  mechanisms  and alternate treatment  options.  
2) Chronic  Urticaria  (itching  and/or  hives)  with or without  Angioedema which  are known  mast  
cell mediated processes  previously  shown  to be responsive  to the use of omalizumab.  
3) Previous  usage of omalizumab  in the last 3 months  which  can affect  the patient -related 
outcomes  and biomarker  assessments if not “washed out” of the system.  
 4) Patients, who in the judgment of the investigator, have a history or condition that might 
compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with evaluations, or preclude completion of the 
study.

Study  design : This study  is a randomized,  double- blind,  placebo- controlled,  parallel  group trial which  will 
study  the effects  of omalizumab  on patients  with 2 or more  episodes  of Idiopathic  Angioedema (IAE)  in 
the past 6 months,  despite current  therapy.  This study  has three periods;  screening,  treatment,  and 
follow -up. Subjects  in the screening  period will be consented  and screened for eligibility  criteria.  40 
qualified individuals  will enter  the treatment  period.  Individuals  will be randomized to either  every 4 weeks  
subcutaneous  administration of omalizumab  300mg (20 subjects)  versus  every 4 weeks  placebo injection  
(20 subjects)  in addition to their previously  prescribed management  plan for a total of 24 weeks . 
Individuals  will then enter  a follow -up period of 4 months.  Study  visits  will occur  every 4 weeks  during the 
treatment  period  for update  of clinical status  and administration of omalizumab/placebo injection.  After,  
the treatment  period individuals  will be seen twice  for follow -up. The entire study  will consist  of 10 study  
visits  and will last approx.  10 months.  
Efficacy  assessments:  
• Changes  in the patient -related outcome measure of Angioedema Activity  Score  (AAS7,  (Weller  
et al., 2013))  
Other  assessments:  
• Changes  in the quality  of life of idiopathic  angioedema patients  as determined by the 
Angioe dema  QoL Questionnaire (AE-QoL,  Weller  et al., Allergy  2012)  
• Changes  in the severity  of angioedema episodes  in the past 4 weeks  will be determined using  
changes  in the patient -related outcome measure of Angioedema Activity  Score  (AAS28,  
(Weller  et al., 2013))  
• Frequency,  duration of IAE episodes  (hours),  rescue  medication or corticosteroid usage,  and 
number  of unscheduled clinic/urgent  care/ER  visits  will be based on monthly  recall  with 
questionnaires  performed  at each study  visit. 
8 
 • Visual  analog  score  for IAE severity  will be determined at each study  visit. 
• We will identify  any reported AE during the course  of the study.  
• We will examine changes  in basophil  flow cytometry  (CD63  and CD203  expression),  tryptase,  
bradykinin and its degradation products,  and platelet  activating factor  (PAF).  
 
Data  analysis:  
The primary  analysis  will estimate  the effect  of treatment,  compared to placebo,  on the change in 
Angioedema Activity  Score  (AAS7)  from baseline to the end of the treatment  period using analysis  of 
covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment  group and baseline AAS7  as covariates.  Longitudinal  comparisons  
of the repeated (monthly)  AAS7  measurements  will also be examined using linear  mixed  effect  models  in 
a secondary  analysis.  For the secondary  outcomes,  a similar  strategy  will be used,  adjusting for the 
baseline value of the outcome where possible,  using similar  linear  models  or generalized linear  models  
including count  regression for frequency  outcomes  and logistic  regression for categorical  outcomes.  
Participants  will be compared as-randomized using the intention- to-treat principle.  Missing  data will be 
addressed using  multiple  imputations.

1 Background 
Angioedema (AE) refers  to the rapid swelling  of the deep dermis,  submucosal  and subcutaneous  tissue  
while  urticaria  involves  swelling  in the upper  dermis.  It occurs  as a result  of a transient  extravasation of 
fluid into the interstitium  due to the release of vasoactive substances.  Angioedema can involve  various  
tissues  and regions  of the body  including face,  lip, tongue,  mouth,  throat,  larynx,  extremities,  abdomen,  
and genitalia.  Angioedema  can be life-threatening especially  when affecting  tissues  within  the respiratory  
tract.  Several  different  types  of AE have been recognized over the years  including  most  notably  
hereditary angioedema (HAE),  ACE- inhibitor  induced angioedema (ACEI -AE), acquired angioedema  
(AAE),  and an idiopathic  form (IAE)  that could be either  histaminergic  or nonhistaminergic  in etiology.  
IAE is defined as angioedema episodes  that occur  without  any clear  identifiable etiology  and not 
associated with HAE (hereditary  angioedema),  ACE- inhibitor  induced angioedema,  acquired  
angioedema,  and angioedema associated with chronic  urticaria.  
 
The time course  of the angioedema episode is variable lasting  anywhere from 1-4 days  with the 
nonhistaminergic  forms  taking longer  to resolve.  HAE can start to present  early  in childhood and worsen  
around puberty  with symptoms  involving  the abdominal  wall, extremities,  face and upper  airway  and can 
last about  24-48 hours.  Recurrent  abdominal  pain usually  prompts  its evaluation.  ACEI -AE has an 
incidence of approximately  0.1-0.7%  with symptoms  targeting the face,  lips, tongue,  larynx  and pharynx.    
It is characteristically  associated with the usage of an ACE-I. Acquired angioedema is an adult  onset    
form often  associated with the presence  of a lymphoproliferative disorder  with symptoms  targeting the 
face,  upper  airways  and abdomen.  Idiopathic  angioedema is poorly  characterized  and symptoms  involve  
the extremities,  face,  and upper  airways with  a lower  preponderance  for the abdomen.  While  involvement  
of the larynx  and pharynx  has been reported,  it involves  the respiratory  tract much  less frequently.  
 
It is important  to establish or exclude an appropriate etiology  for AE as the therapeutic  algorithms  for 
management  varies.  HAE subtypes  (Type  I and II) are well characterized forms  of AE with known  defects  
in the SERPING1  gene resulting  in depressed  complement  profiles  (low C4) including  abnormal  C1 
inhibitor  level and/or  function.  An evaluation of complement  profiles  and C1 inhibitor  level and function  
can help to delineate these  entities.  A new subtype of HAE (Type  III) has been recently  described with a 
normal  complement  profile  and C1 inhibitor  panel  that occurs  as a result  of mutations  in the Factor  XII 
gene.  It has a more  characteristic  association to estrogen exposure.  Acquired angioedema has a similar  
complement  profile  to HAE Type  I with one distinguishing feature-  a low C1q level.  No known  genetic  
mutations  are associated with AAE.  ACEI -AE has a normal  complement  profile  and is associated with 
ACE- I usage.  Idiopathic  angioedema also has a normal  complement  profile,  but some  of the 
distinguishing  features  of the above are lacking.  Mechanistically,  increased levels  of bradykinin and 
degradation products  appear  to play a role in all forms  of angioedema with some  forms  having a mast -cell 
mediated component  that is responsive  to antihistamine therapy.  
 
 
2 Purpose  and rationale  
Treatment  guidelines  are clearly  established for the management  of HAE I and II for prophylactic  and 
abortive purposes,  and avoidance of ACE- I is recommended for ACEI -AE. However,  no clear  guidelines  
exist for the diagnosis  or management  of IAE. Current  therapies  typically  include  avoidance of potential  
triggers  and use of medications  either  for prophylaxis  or for acute events,  such  as antihistamines,  
corticosteroids,  and epinephrine.  There remains  a critical  unmet  need for therapeutic  options  to provide  
more  effective  prophylaxis  and possible disease -modification effects  for patients  with IAE. For example,  
there are some  patients  using  chronic  prophylactic  antihistamine  therapy  and for any acute episode of 
IAE, they may take additional  on demand medications  such  as additional  doses  of antihistamine and/or  
corticosteroid.  There are others  who may not use any chronic  prophylaxis  and only use on demand  
antihistamines  and/or  corticosteroids  with acute episodes  of IAE. 
10 
 Omalizumab  recently  garnered FDA-approval  for chronic  urticaria  with or without  angioedema.  Evidence  
from trials performed in chronic  urticaria  suggests  that omalizumab  is efficacious  in controlling both 
urticarial  flares  and concurrent  angioedema episodes.  However,  omalizumab has not yet been well 
investigated for IAE, though there have been some  case  reports  that suggest  efficacy  for IAE (Azofra  et 
al., 2015;  Ozturk  and Kocaturk,  2014;  Sands  et al., 2007;  Weller  et al., 2013)  
 
With the efficacy  observed in urticaria  patients,  it is clear  that omalizumab  can suppress  mast  cell activity,  
although the mechanisms  for the benefit  remain somewhat  unclear.  The kinetics  of omalizumab  effects,  
especially  in the context  of chronic  spontaneous  urticaria,  suggests  that sequestration of IgE molecules  is 
not the complete answer.  Given  the likely  role of mast  cells in the majority  of IAE, we hypothesize  that 
omalizumab  will have potential  disease modifying effects in reducing the severity and frequency  of 
IAE. 
 
3 Objectives 
3.1 Primary  objectives  
To estimate  the effect  of omalizumab  in reducing the severity  of angioedema episodes  in patients  
with IAE. 
 
3.2 Secondary  objectives  
To estimate  the effect  of omalizumab  in improving  quality  of life in IAE subjects.  
To estimate  the effect  of omalizumab  in reducing frequency,  duration of angioedema episodes,  need for 
rescue medication/corticosteroids,  and need for unscheduled clinic/urgent  care/ER  visits.  
To assess  the safety  of omalizumab  usage in patients  with IAE. 
To assess  the effect  of omalizumab on biomarkers  previously  implicated  in the pathogenesis  of IAE. 
 
 
4 Study  design  
This study  is a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled,  parallel  group trial which  will study  the 
effects  of omalizumab  on patients  over the age of 18 with 2 or more  episodes  of Idiopathic Angioedema  
(IAE)  in the past 6 months,  despite current  therapy.  This study  has three periods;  screening,  treatment,  
and follow -up. Subjects  in the screening period will be consented and screened for eligibility  criteria.  If 
subjects  have not had a complement  profile  within  the normal  reference range (C1 Esterase inhibitor  
panel) , subjects  will be asked to return for a second screening visit to assess their complement  profile.  
Subjects  in the screening period will also undergo a 24-hour urine collection for mast cell mediators ( such 
as n-methyl  histamine,  11β- PGF2α, and PGD2  testing ) and a blood draw  for chronic  urticaria index  
testing  in addition to the C1 esterase inhibitor panel. If under the subject’s  current care guidelines, they are 
taking prednisone or other immunomodulator episodically (on demand usage) we will collect baseline test 
after a 14 day washout period has occurred. If there is no such window or they are taking daily medication, 
we will p roceed with the baseline measurements  despite the use of an immunomodulatory or prednisone.  
40 qualified individuals  will enter  the treatment  period.  Individuals  will have a baseline assessment  and be 
randomized to either  every 4 week subcutaneous  administration of omalizumab  300mg (20 subjects)  
versus  every 4 week  placebo injection  (20 subjects)  in addition to their previously  prescribed management  
plan for a total of 6 months.  Individuals  will then enter  a follow -up period of 4 months.  Study  visits  will occur  
every 4 weeks  during the treatment  period for update of clinical  status  and administration of 
omalizumab/placebo injection. After  the treatment  period individuals  will be seen  twice  for follow -up, 4 
weeks and 12 weeks post treatment . The entire study  will consist  of 10 study  visits  and will last approx.  10 
months  (see Table 4-1). The blind will be maintained for the full 10 months of  the study.

5 Population  
Forty  adults  (age 18 or older)  with 2 or more  episodes  of Idiopathic  Angioedema (IAE)  in the past 6 months,  
despite being on recommended therapy  for the past 6 months  will enter  the treatment  period at the University  of 
Wisconsin -Madison Allergy  and Asthma  Clinical  Research Unit. Once  an individual  enters  the treatment  phase 
they will be counted as 1 of the 40 subjects,  and they will not be replaced.  It is anticipated that  we will need to 
screen  60 subjects  in order  to obtain 40 qualified participants.  
 
Subjects will  primarily  be recruited by Dr s. Mathur and Viswana than from their clinics. Subjects who are seen in 
their clinics for a  diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema will be asked if they are interested in participating in this 
study. If yes, their contact information will be given to the Allergy R esearch Staff to do a follow up call for a phone 
screen. The following information will be faxed to the allergy research staff: name, phone number, alternate phone 
number, and email address. If no, their information will not be shared with the Allergy Research Staff.  
 
Additionally, we will use UW Healt h Electronic  Medical Record system  (HealthLink)  to send out recruitment letters . 
Letters will be sent to those individuals (age 18 or older) who have ICD 9/10 code for angioedema with no history 
of drug- induc ed angioedema, hereditary angioedema, or a history of urtic aria. The letters  will invite them to 
participate in the study and notify them that they will receive a follow up phone call regarding the study.  
 
Letters will be also be sent out to local allergist s notifying them of the study. The letter will include a second letter 
which can be given to their patients they feel would qualify for the study. In addition, advertisements  will be placed 
12 
 around the local hospital and clinics.  
 
This study  recruitment and treatment  is expected to last 5 years, from the recruitment of the first subject, wi th 
anticipated end date of 12/20 21. Study analysis is expected to last an additional year.

6 Treatment  
6.1 Investigational  and control  drugs  
Omalizumab  is a sterile,  white,  preservative- free, lyophilized  powder,  contained in a single -use vial that will be 
reconstituted with sterile  water  for injection  (SWFI),  USP,  and administered as a subcutaneous  injection.  Each  
omalizumab  vial contains  202.5 mg of omalizumab,  145.5 mg sucrose,  2.8 mg L-histidine  hydrochloride 
monohydrate,  1.8 mg L-histidine,  and 0.5 mg polysorbate 20. Each  vial is designed to deliver  150 mg of 
omalizumab  in 1.2 mL after reconstitution  with 1.4 mL SWFI,  USP.  
Placebo will be provided by drug supply management  
 
6.2 Treatment  arms  
Patients  will be assigned to one of the following  2 treatment  arms  in a ratio of 1:1 
• Arm 1: Omalizumab : 300mg subcutaneous  injection  every 4 weeks  for 24 weeks . Total  dose 
will be divided  into two 150mg/1.2mL injections.  
• Arm 2: Placebo Group:  two 1.2mL subcutaneous  injections  every 4 weeks  for 24 weeks . 
6.3 Treatment  assignment  
Randomization will be completed by the University  of Wisconsin  Hospital  and Clinics  Pharmaceutical  Research 
Center  using  a forced  block  design.  Once a subject  has been cleared for initial  treatment,  the next ascending 
sequential  randomization number  (and corresponding treatment)  will be assigned.  
Subjects  will be enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment  arms  in a 1:1 ratio.  
 
6.4 Treatment  blinding  
All subjects  and research staff will be blinded to treatment  assignment;  study  drug will be administered  by a single  
unblinded research nurse (who  will not be evaluating patients  or collecting data).  Double blinded  treatment  will be 
maintained until the conclusion of the study.  Randomization and treatment  preparation  will be handled by the 
unblinded Hospital  Pharmacy.  Unblinding of the investigators,  statisticians  and research team  will occur  at the 
conclusion  of data analysis.  
Subjects  will remain  blinded until analysis  of the trial has been completed.  At the conclusion of the study  analysis,  
participants  will be notified  through  written  notification from Drs. Mathur  or Viswanathan of their treatment  
assignment.  
6.5 Treating the patient  
 
6.5.1 Patient numbering  
Patients  will be assigned a Subject  ID# upon screening;  Randomization Number  (and treatment)  will be assigned 
prior to first treatment,  but after subject  has been cleared for treatment.  
 
6.5.2 Dispensing the study  drug  
Once randomized to a study  treatment,  the product  will be prepared by unblinded staff in the UW hospital  
pharmacy.   
Omalizumab -assigned  subjects 
• Reconstitution:  
o Using  a 1 inch, 18g needle  and 3mL syringe,  draw  up 1.4mL of Sterile  Water  for Injection  (SWFI),  
USP 
14 
 o Slowly  add the SWFI  to the wet the powder,  do not shake  
o Gently  swirl the upright  vial for 5-10 seconds  approximately  every  5 minutes  until dissolved;  
generally,  takes  20 minutes  to dissolve  completely  
o Continue to swirl gently  until no gel-like particles are visible;  do not use if contents are not 
completely  dissolved after 40 minutes  
o Resulting solution is 150mg/1.2mL  
• Drawing  up the dose  
o Invert  the vial for 15 seconds  so the solution drains  toward  the stopper  
o Remove all of the solution in the vial by inserting a new 3mL syringe  with a 1inch,  18g needle  into the 
inverted vial 
o Expel  any air or bubbles  or excess solution to obtain the 1.2mL dose.  
o Remove needle  and cap with a sterile  rubber  tip. 
o Expiration = 4 hours  if stored  at room  temperature and 8 hours  if stored under  refrigeration.  
 
Placebo -assigned  subjects  
• Drawing  up the dose  
o Draw  up 1.2mL  placebointo  a 3mL syringe.  
o Expel  any air or bubbles  or excess solution to obtain the 1.2mL dose.  
o Remove needle  and cap with a sterile  rubber  tip. 
o Expiration = 4 hours  if stored  at room  temperature and 8 hours  if stored under  refrigeration.  
 
6.5.3 Study  drug supply,  storage and tracking  
Omalizumab  will be provided in 150mg single  use vials containing sterile,  white,  Preservative- Free,  lyophilized  
powder.  Vials  will be stored  under  refrigeration at 2o to 8o (36o to 46o F). 
Matching placebo will be supplied by Novartis. Vials  will be stored at room  temperature:  20o to 25o (68o to 77 oF); 
that results  in a mean kinetic  temperature  calculated to be not more  than 25o; and that allows  for excursions  
between 15o and 30o (59o and 86oF). 
All study  provided products  must  be received  at the study  site by a designated individual,  handled and stored  
safely  and properly,  and kept in a secured location to which  only the investigator  and designated  staff have  
access.  Storage conditions  must  be adequately  monitored and appropriately  documented as source  information.   
Investigator  or designee must  maintain  an accurate record  of the  shipment  and dispensing  of study  drug and all 
supplies  are to be used only for subjects  on this protocol  and not for any other  purposes.   Study  drug will be 
supplied from Novartis  in 3 shipments,  6 months  apart.  
 
6.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking the study  drug  
Each  study  drug dose (Omalizumab 300mg  or Placebo)  will consist  of two syringes;  each containing 1.2 mL total 
volume.  Due to the viscosity  of Omalizumab,  study  drug must  be administered  by an unblinded  Research Nurse.  
Active  omalizumab  may take a total of 5 to 10 seconds  to administer  and the placebo  significantly  less time;  as 
such  the Research Nurse  will slowly  administer  the placebo at a rate of 0.5 ml per sec. The unblinded Research 
Nurse  will continue to maintain the blind  for both active  and placebo  subjects.  
Study  drug injections  will be repeated every 4 weeks  +/- 7 days for a total of 24 weeks  under  protocol  stipulations.  
Administer  only under  direct  medical  supervision and observe patient  for a minimum of 2 hours  following  
administration of any dose given for the first three visits,  and then 30 minutes  for any subsequent  doses.  
 
6.5.5 Permitted  study  drug dose adjustments and interruptions  
No dosage  modification  of study  drug will be allowed  during this study.  
15 
  
If a subject misses a dose of medication by more than a week  (7 days),  that dose will be skipped.  If a subject  misses  
more  than two subsequent  doses  in the dosing series  the subject  will no longer  receive study medication,  but will 
remain in the study  and be labeled SDD  (study  drug discontinuation).  
 
6.5.6 Rescue medication  
Study  drug must  be administered in a location with ready  access  to emergency  medication (epinephrine) and 
supplies  in the event  of serious  hypersensitivity  reaction.  Study drug administration will occur in the Clinical 
Research Unit North, Allergy Research offices. The allergy research Investigator on-call staff will be available for 
any emergent situations.  Emergency  supplies  must  include  those  as needed for airway  management  and 
resuscitation.  Subjects  must  be observed for a minimum of 2 hours  before being discharged to home after the first 
three administrations,  or 30 min after subsequent  doses.   
 
6.5.7 Study  drug discontinuation and premature patient  withdrawal  
Study  drug must  be discontinued if the subject  becomes  pregnant.  
The investigator  has the right to discontinue a patient  from study  treatment  for any medical  condition that 
the investigator  determines  may jeopardize the patient’s  safety  if he or she continues  on study  treatment,  
noncompliance (e.g. missed  2 consecutive  visits  or 3 total visits)  or an anaphylactic  reaction to study  
drug.  Every effort  will be made to continue to follow  patients  who discontinue from study  treatment.  
 
 
6.5.8 Emergency  unblinding of treatment assignment  
Subjects  will not be unblinded prior to the final analysis  of study  data.  If subjects  have an anaphylactic  
reaction to study  medication or an idiopathic  trigger,  they will be treated appropriately  and will no 
longer  receive study  medication.  Subjects  will be labeled SDD , study  drug discontinuation.

7.1 Information  to be collected on screening failures  
At the screening visits  the following  information will be collected on all subjects : assessment  for 
frequency,  duration of IAE episodes  (hours),  rescue medication  or corticosteroid usage,  complement  
profiles  (C1 Esterase inhibitor  panel ), Chronic  Urticaria Index  Urine  mast cell mediators ( such as  n-
methyl  histamine,  11β- PGF2α, PGD2 ), AAS7  and 28 and Ae-QOL questionnaire  responses,  and 
number  of unscheduled clinic/urgent  care/ER  visits  in the past year.  
Screen failures may be rescreened at the discretion of the investigator and will keep the same 
screening ID number.  
 
7.2 Patient  demographics/other  baseline characteristics  
At the screening visits  the following  information will be collected on all subjects : assessment  for frequency,  
duration of IAE episodes  (hours),  rescue medication or corticosteroid  usage,  complement  profiles  (C1 
Esterase inhibitor  panel ), Chronic  Urticaria Index,  Urine  mast cell mediators ( such as n-methyl  histamine,  
11b-PGF2a,  PGD2 ), AAS7,  28 and Ae-QOL questionnaire responses,  and number  of unscheduled 
clinic/urgent  care/ER  visits  in the past year.  
17 
 At the baseline visit, we will also examine  basophil  flow cytometry  (CD63  and CD203 expression),  
tryptase,  bradykinin and bradykinin  degradation products,  and platelet  activating  factor  (PAF).  
Complement  profiles  will be collected for the purposes  of study  inclusion,  C1 Esterase  inhibitor  panel  must  be 
within  normal  reference values.  
 
7.3 Treatment  exposure and compliance 
Questionnaires  such  as AAS and Ae-QOL  will be collected during treatment  visits  every 4 weeks . 
Additionally,  assessment for frequency,  duration of IAE episodes  (hours),  rescue  medication or 
corticosteroid usage,  visual  analog score  for IAE severity  and number  of unscheduled clinic/urgent  care/ER  
visits  in the previous  month  will be collected.  
Every 12 weeks , at the treatment  visits  and at the conclusion of the trial, we will also examine changes  in basophil  
flow cytometry  (CD63  and CD203 expression),  tryptase,  bradykinin and its degradation products,  and platelet  
activating factor  (PAF).  
 
7.4 Efficacy  
All subjects  will be given a paper  questionnaire by the research nurses  to assess their angioedema  disease activity. 
Each  patient  will be given a quiet  room  to complete the questionnaire.  Patients  will report  their disease activity  on 
an Angioedema Activity  Score (AAS,  Appendix  1, (Weller  et al., 2013)),  at baseline and during all study  visits.  The 
Angioedema Activity  Score  is a validated  disease specific  patient - reported outcomes  questionnaire.  The AAS 
consists of 5 questions  plus yes/ no questions  for disease presence  days.  A categorical  score  between 0 and 3 
has been assigned each answer.  The question scores  are summed  up to an AAS day sum score,  7 AAS day sum 
scores  to an AAS week  sum score  (AAS7)  (primary  outcome),  and 4 ASS week  sum scores  may be summed  up to 
an AAS 4-week  sum score  (AAS28)  per the scoring  template.  
Accordingly,  the minimum and maximum possible AAS scores  are 0-15 (AAS day sum score),  0-105 (AAS7),  and 
0-420 (AAS28).  
 
7.4.1  Efficacy  assessment  1 
The Urticaria  Activity  Score,  UAS7,  is a widely accepted for its usage in individuals  with Urticaria, and  has been 
used in previous  omalizumab  (Xolair) trials,  however given the focus  of this trial on  angioedema, the  AAS is more  
relevant.  The AAS is a validated,  published angioedema tool (Weller  et al., 2013).  
 
7.5 Safety  
All subjects will be assessed for the incidence and severity of adverse events, using an adverse event reporting 
guidelines at each study visit. Data safety monitoring will be completed by the UW Madison ICTR data and safety 
monitoring board (DSMB).  We plan to utilize the UW ICTR Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to oversee the study, 
and function as an external DSMB.  Study progress and safety will be reviewed annually (and more frequently if 
needed) by the DMC. The UW ICTR DMC is comprised of experienced members (core plus ad hoc) with expertise 
required to oversee this study. The DMC members will review protocol -specific reports created by statisticians using 
data pulled from the ICTR OnCore clinical research management system. Progress reports, including patient 
recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be provided to the Data Monitoring Committee following each of the 
annual reviews. The DMC members will review protocol -specific reports created by statisticians that serve a non-
voting member role on t he DMC using data extracted from the ICTR OnCore- CRM system. These standard reports 
will include an overview of study objectives, a review of actual and projected accrual rates, an evaluation of subject 
demographics, a summary of the number and seriousness  of adverse events. An interim analysis of study results 
may be performed and source documents may be reviewed to allow the DMC to independently judge whether the 
overall integrity and conduct of the protocol remain acceptable based on data provided and reported by the Principal 
Investigator. The DMC will make recommendations to the Principal Investigator that could include actions of 
continuation, modification, suspension, or termination.  
 
 
18 
 7.5.1 Physical  examination 
Participants  will be assessed  by a trained medical  professional  for changes  in vital signs.  
 
7.5.2 Pregnancy and assessments of fertility  
 
Pregnancy  tests  will be administered  at the screening  visit 1B and all subsequent visits on  all pre-menopausal  
female  patients  by the clinical  research  staff.  Additionally,  all pre-menopausal  women must  agree to maintain  a 
reliable form of birth control  though out their participation of the study. 
 
7.6 Other  assessments 
 
7.6.1 Health- related Quality  of Life 
Angioedema QoL Questionnaire (AE-QoL,  Appendix  2 (Weller  et al., 2012) ) is a validated symptom  specific 
questionnaire.  The AE-QoL can be completed at any time during the study  visits  and subjects  will be given a quiet  
room  to answer  all written  questions.  Research coordinator  will administer  and grade  the written  questionnaires.  
Each  questionnaire consists of validated questions  pertaining to functioning,  fatigue/mood,  fears/shame and 
nutrition.  The AE-QoL will produce individual’s  scores  for each  assessment  as a profile  instrument  and for a total 
score  as an index  instrument.  The minimum sum for each  assessment  is 1 point  per question and the maximum is 
5 points  per question and scores  are calculated using the following  formula  (Σ items  - min Σ items)  // (max  Σ items  - 
min Σ items)  x 100. Scores  are linear  in value and reported as a percent,  with 0% being the lowest  score  and 100%  
being the highest.  If more  than one question is missed,  the score  is not valid and will not be included in the analysis.  
 
Visual  analog  scores,  Appendix  3 will be collected  on all subjects,  by a trained research coordinator.  At the 
screening visit, the participant will  be asked to rate their overall  health state  at their most  recent  angioedema event.  
The rating  will be done on a scale  of 0-100 with 100 increments,  with 100 being the best imaginable  state,  and 0 
being the worst  imaginable state.  This data will be collected by giving  the subject  a scale  which will be printed on a 
sheet  of paper,  the subject  will then draw  a line where they feel best describes  their health state  at the indicated 
time.  The research coordinator  will then report  the value  (as 000) closest  to the line drawn.  Participants  will then 
repeat  this value at each subsequent  visit if they have  had an angioedema event  since  the previous  visit. The 
lowest  possible  score  will be 0 and the highest  possible score  will be 100. 
 
7.6.2 Other  Biomarkers  
At screening (V1B),  venipuncture will be performed for 1-3mL plain red tube and 1 -8.5mL serum  separator  tube.  The 
collected tubes  will be for analysis  of complement  C1 Esterase inhibitor  panel  and Chronic Urticaria Index Instruction  
for urine collection  will be sent home with subject  (V1A)  for 24 hour urine  collection,  urine will be returned at V1B.  
Urine  will be tested for mast cell mediators such as n-methyl  histamine,  11βPGF2α, and PGD2.  Blood for C1 
Esterase Inhibitor pane and urine will be sent to UWHC  central  core lab for processing.  Blood for CUI will be 
processed by research lab and frozen for batch testing at time of study analysis.  Subjects  will be off prednisone for 2 
weeks  at V1B,  unless  prednisone is used  as daily therapy.  
At baseline (V2),  every  12 weeks  (V5, 8) during study  treatment,  and at 12 weeks  post treatment  (V9) all subjects  
regardless  of study  treatment  will have a venipuncture.  Collection  of blood will be performed prior to receiving  
study  treatment.  Venipuncture will be performed under  standard procedures,  and 60 ml of blood will be drawn (2-10 
ml Serum  Separator  Tubes,  1-5 ml red top tube,  2- 10 ml EDTA  tubes  and 1- 4ml EDTA tube).  All samples  will be 
processed  for serum and plasma  by centrifuging at 1500 RPM  for 10 min, supernatant  will be collected and 
aliquoted in 0.5 ml/ aliquot  and immediately  frozen at -80 degrees  in cryotubes.  The additional  sample  drawn at the 
University  of Wisconsin -Madison for basophil  flow cytometry  method is described  below.   
Serum  and plasma  will be analyzed by commercial  ELISA at the conclusion of the study  for the following:  
tryptase,  bradykinin and it degradation products,  and platelet  activating factor  (PAF).  
Basophil  flow cytometry  for CD63  and CD203  expression will be performed on 4 ml of EDTA blood.  The buffy  coat 
will be collected by spinning the samples  at 700g for 15 min and collecting  the cell population in between the 
erythrocyte layer  and the plasma  layer.  Once the buffy  coat (leukocytes)  has been collected,  the cells will be 
washed in a solution of HEPES- heparin buffered solution (HBE)  by centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min. Finally,  
19 
 pelleted cells with  be re-suspended in 5 ml of HBE.  Cells  with then undergo either  no activation,  activation by 
FMLP,  activation  by IgE or activation by calcium ionophore A23187.  Cells  will   then be stained,  and have flow 
cytometry  performed using CD63  and CD203  as markers  of basophil  activation (Chirumbolo et al., 2008).)  
 
 
8 Safety  monitoring  
8.1 Adverse  events 
Definition  of an AE: Any untoward medical  occurrence  in a subject  administered a pharmaceutical  product  temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or 
disease (new or exacerbated)  temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal  (investigational)  product . Anticipated 
day-to-day fluctuations  of the disease under study that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or 
worsening do not need to be considered an adverse event, unless they:  
1.  fulfill the definition of a serious adverse event, or  
2. have worsened and are clinically significant requiring medical intervention other than the use of the rescue 
medication, or  
3. result in discontinuation of subject from the study.  
  
Investigational  Medicinal  Product  (IMP)  includes  the drug under  evaluation and the comparator  drug(s)  if speci fied 
as part of the research objective,  given at any time during the study.  Medical  conditions/  diseases  present  before 
starting  the drug of interest  are only considered adverse events  if they worsen  after starting  the drug of interest.  
Beginning at visit 3 and throughout the study, the Investigator and study staff will record all adverse events on an 
adverse event form to be maintained in the subject’s research chart, regardless of the severity or relationship to 
investigational product  or procedure. The form will include observation date and resolution date.  
 
All adverse events will be graded by severity using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, May 28, 2009 listed bel ow: 
Grade 1= Mild adverse event  
Grade 2= Moderate adverse event  
Grade 3= Severe and undesirable adverse event  
Grade 4= Life threatening or disabling adverse event  
Grade 5= Death 
 
Assessment of Causality  
The principal or co- investigator will assess the relationship between investigational product and the occurrence of 
each AE/SAE.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  Alternative causes, such 
as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors and the temporal relationship 
of the event to the investigational product will be considered and investigated.   
The relationship between as adverse event and the investigational product will be recorded on the study adverse 
event form. The NCI -CTCAE provides the following descriptors and definitions for assigning relationship. This NCI 
nomenclature will be used but causality will be judged by the investigators in the context of asthma.  
 
 
 
 
20 
 Code  Descriptor  Definition  
1 Unrelated  The event is clearly not related to the investigational product  
2 Unlikely  The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational product  
3 Possible  The adverse event may be related to the investigational product  
4 Probable The adverse event is likely related to the investigational product  
5 Definite  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational product  
 
Study Related Non- serious and Unexpected or Expected Adverse Event Reporting 
All non-serious and unexpected adverse events will be kept in an adverse event log and reported annually to the 
study DSMC until the completion of the study.  Other adverse events, for any study procedures or use of 
investigational product, that are both not s erious and expected will not be reported to the study DSMC. These are 
the expected adverse events listed in the protocol and consent as possible results from a study procedure. The 
investigator will meet all local reporting requirements as dictated by the UW IRB.  
The most common adverse events associated with study drug administration include allergic reaction to the study 
medication, nausea, headache, swelling of the inside of the nose, throat or sinuses, cough, joint pain, and upper 
respiratory infections . 
8.2 Serious adverse event  reporting  
A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is defined (21 CFR 312.32 (a) ) as any adverse event occurring at any 
dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution. This includes, but may not be 
limited to any of the following events:  
 Death: A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator during the 
protocol -defined follow -up after the completion of therapy, whether or not considered treatment -related, 
must be reported.  
 Life-threatening: Any adverse therapy experience that places the participant or participant, in the view 
of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
 Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 An event that required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
 
An important medical event that does not meet the criteria listed above may be consi dered an SAE when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations.  
These situations might include an important medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgi cal intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  
Timelines:  All serious adverse events (SAEs) from interventional clinical trials  must be reported by the  sites to 
Novartis  and UW Madison DSMB within  24 hours  of occurrence of the SAE.  The timelines  for investigator  
initiated  trials reporting to Novartis  will be done as per Third  Party  Study/Investigator  Initiated  Trial 
Agreement.

 8.2.1  Adverse Event of Special  Interest  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest are defined as a potential safety problem, identified as a result of safety 
monitoring of the Product . Special interest AEs will be collected and reported to the Sponsor per SAE guidelines.  
The XOLAIR® (omalizumab) Events of Special Interest are:  
•         Anaphylaxis  
•         Drug -induced liver injury  
•         Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug  
 
8.2.2  Follow -up reports  
SAEs  will be followed until resolution or until it is judged to be permanent,  and an assessment  will be made  at each 
visit (or more  frequently,  if necessary)  of any changes  in severity, the suspected  relationship to the drug of interest,  
the interventions  required to treat it, and the outcome.  
The Sponsor  shall support  Novartis  in the following -up of all SAEs  so that complete  information  is available to 
maintain  patient  safety  and also as part of any commitments  by Novartis  to any Health  authority  OR specific Health 
authority  follow -up requests  for the product  under  investigation.  
 We will use the UW -ICTR for local data monitoring oversight. This plan includes the use of the ICTR OnCore 
clinical research management (OnCore- CRM) system which allows more efficient tracking of protocols and protocol 
subjects. ICTR OnCore -CRM is a secur e, web- based, customizable information system that addresses issues 
related to the costs and complexities associated with conducting clinical trials. It provides fully integrated clinical 
data management, study administration, and financial management capabilities for a portfolio of clinical trials. The 
ICTR OnCore -CRM system is specifically designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical research 
at large research centers by facilitating core activities such as study setup and activation, accrual, clinical data 
collection and analysis, data and safety monitoring, financial management, and regulatory compliance.  
Safety Review Plan – We plan to utilize the UW ICTR Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to oversee the study. 
Study progress and safety  will be reviewed annually (and more frequently if needed) by the DMC. The UW ICTR 
DMC is comprised of experienced members with expertise required to oversee this study. The DMC members will 
review protocol -specific reports created by statisticians using data pulled from the ICTR OnCore clinical research 
management system. Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be provided to 
the Data Monitoring Committee following each of the annual reviews. The DMC members will review protocol -
specific reports created by statisticians that serve a non- voting member role on the DMC using data extracted from 
the ICTR OnCore- CRM system. These standard reports will include an overview of study objectives, a review of 
actual and projected accrual rates, an evaluation of subject demographics, a summary of the number and 
seriousness of adverse events. An interim analysis of study results may be performed and source documents may 
be reviewed to allow the DMC to independently judge whether  the overall integrity and conduct of the protocol 
remain acceptable based on data provided and reported by the Principal Investigator. The DMC will make 
recommendations to the Principal Investigator that could include actions of continuation, modification, suspension, 
or termination.  
 
8.2.3 Individual and Overall Study Stopping Rules  
Based upon the definition of Serious Adverse Event as described in 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
Individual Safety Stopping Rules  
Individuals will be stopped from the study if the following events occur:  
a. If anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity AEs occur within 2 hours of administration of study drug.  
b. If anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity AEs occur within 8 hours of study drug on consecutive 
administrations. 
c. If SAE of angioedema or severe allergic re action, e.g. anaphylaxis, involves hospitalization.  
Anaphylaxis to drug will be distinguished from Angioedema activity primarily by clinical evaluation of symptoms and 
timing of reaction. Anaphylaxis often involves multiple organ systems whereas Angioedema  will only be skin without 
22 
 hives. Anaphylaxis to drug will occur soon after administration (unlikely more than 2 hours later) whereas 
Angioedema can occur at any time.  
Overall Safety Stopping Rules  
The study will be stopped if:  
a. A research related death occurs in any subject.  
b. An event occurs that the investigator feels warrants halting of the study.  
c. If >25% enrolled subjects (after at least 8 subjects enrolled) experience study drug-related AEs.   
d. The same or similar serious and unexpected adverse event as sociated with the investigational 
product that occurs in at least two subjects. This may include a potentially life -threatening event, 
event requiring hospitalization, or any event that may potentially result in serious harm to other 
research subjects.  
e. For non -serious adverse events, if more than 25% of research subjects meet the  
8.3 Pregnancies 
To ensure patient  safety,  each pregnancy  in a patient  (or a patients’  partner)  on study  drug must  be reported  to 
Novartis  within  24 hours  of learning of its occurrence.  The pregnancy  will be followed up to determine outcome,  
including spontaneous  or voluntary  termination,  details  of the birth,  and the presence  or absence of any birth 
defects,  congenital  abnormalities,  or maternal  and/or  newborn complications.  
 
REPRODUCTIVE RISKS 
Pregnancy  Category  B 
 
Female  who become pregnant  during the study  or males  whose  partner  becomes  pregnant  during the study,  must  
immediately  inform  the study  doctor.  The doctor  will discuss  the risks of continuing with the pregnancy  and the 
possible effects  on the fetus.  The subject’s  doctor  should monitor  until the conclusion  of the pregnancy.   
 
 
9 Data review  and database management  
9.1 Data  collection  
 
Data Quality and Management  
1. Description of Plan for Data Quality and Management – The PI, or study staff, will review all data collection forms 
on an ongoing basis for data completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. When possible, data will 
be collected using programs that allow direct transfer to a spreadsheet, in order to avoid human error. When data 
must be manually entered, double- entry will be used to allow accuracy checks. Accuracy checks will be performed 
by a different individual than those involved in data entry.  
2. Frequency of Data Review for these Studies – The frequency of data review for this study will include annual 
review of subject accrual (adherence to protocol regarding demographics, inclusion/exclusion), adverse event rates 
(injuries), and out of range (non- clinically significant) laboratory data. The PI and Data Monitoring Committee will 
review these data annually.   
 
9.2 Database  management  and quality  control  
Data  will be maintained in a REDCap  and Oncore database,  and it will be the responsibility  of the database 
manager  to ensure data is entered in a timely  manner  and to perform  routine quality  control  checks  of the 
database. The REDCap server is housed in a state- of-the-art data center managed by the UW SMPH network 
staff. The levels of security for the server are fivefold and include: 1) Physical Security: server is located in a 
secure data center under control of UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) ITS, which is a dedicated 
computer machine room (passkey access only) containing emergency backup power, an uninterruptible power 
supply (UPS), and an automatic fire detection and suppression system. SMPH ITS does not have access to the 
23 
 DOM RedCap server; 2) Access controls: Data access is limited to DOM Faculty and staff approved individuals; 3) 
Domain access restrictions: access to DOM computing resources, including the DOM RedCap Server, is restricted 
to individuals with a logon ID for the DOM Domain. Logon IDs are issued only upon approval of the Administrator 
or Data Custodian (PI); 4) Authentication: Password protection is used at the network level  for all transactions that 
allow entry and editing of data, provide access to EPHI data, or administrative activities, and; 5) Firewall: located 
behind UW -Madison SMPH firewall.  
 
We will use the UW -ICTR for local data monitoring oversight. This plan includes the use of the ICTR OnCore 
clinical research management (OnCore- CRM) system which allows more efficient tracking of protocols and 
protocol subjects. ICTR OnCore -CRM is a secure, web- based, customizable information system that addresses 
issues rela ted to the costs and complexities associated with conducting clinical trials. It provides fully integrated 
clinical data management, study administration, and financial management capabilities for a portfolio of clinical 
trials. The ICTR OnCore -CRM system is specifically designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of 
clinical research at large research centers by facilitating core activities such as study setup and activation, accrual, 
clinical data collection and analysis, data and safety monitori ng, financial management, and regulatory 
compliance.  
 
The PI, or study staff, will review all data collection forms on an ongoing basis for data completeness and accuracy 
as well as protocol compliance. When possible, data will be collected using programs that allow direct transfer to a 
spreadsheet, in order to avoid human error. When data must be manually entered, double -entry will be used to 
allow accuracy checks. Accuracy checks will be performed by a different individual than those involved in data 
entry. 
 
The frequency of data review for this study will include annual review of subject accrual (adherence to protocol 
regarding demographics, inclusion/exclusion), adverse event rates (injuries), and out of range (non- clinically 
significant) laboratory data. The PI and Data Monitoring Committee will review these data annually.  
 
10 Data analysis  
10.1 Populations for analysis  
Data  will be analyzed in the following  treatment  groups  
1.) An intent -to-treat analysis  of all randomized individuals,  omalizumab  vs. placebo 
2.) A per-protocol  analysis  of all individuals  who received at least 4 study  doses,  omalizumab  vs. placebo  
 
Interim  analysis may be conducted at the discretion of the study’s statistician and principal investigators.  
 
10.2 Patient  demographics/other  baseline characteristics  
Due to the small  sample size, patient  demographics  will not be used in the data analysis  of this study,  however  for 
the purposes  of publication and reporting we will report  the distribution  per group of the following:  gender,  age, 
race,  and ethnicity.  
The following  baseline characteristics will also be assessed  for distribution,  AAS 7 scores,  AeQoL  score,  visual  
analog scores,  and other  laboratory  data (Urine  n-methyl  histamine,  Urine  11β-PGF2α, Urine  PGD2,  and 
Chronic  urticaria  index) . Chronic  urticaria  index  will only be deemed usable if the partic ipant has not taken 
prednisone within  14 days  of testing.  
 
10.3 Treatments (study  drug,  rescue  medication,  other  concomitant  
therapies,  compliance)  
Due to the small  sample size, at this time the data will not be analyzed for individual  rescue  medications,  however  
the usage of rescue medication  by individuals  will be reported.  
Study  drug and compliance will not be analyzed,  other  than general  reporting.  
24 
  
10.4 Analysis of the primary objective(s)  
10.4.1  Variable  
The primary  outcome is the change in the 7-day Angioedema Activity  Score  (AAS7)  from baseline to end of 
treatment  period.  
 
10.4.2  Statistical  hypothesis,  model,  and method of analysis 
The primary  analysis  will estimate  the effect  of treatment,  compared  to placebo,  on the change in 
Angioedema Activity  Score  (AAS7)  from baseline to the end of the treatment  period  using analysis  of 
covariance (ANCOVA)  with treatment  group and baseline AAS7  as covariates.  The goal of this analysis  is to 
obtain an estimate  and 95% confidence  interval  for the mean treatment  effect.  
 
10.4.3  Handling of missing  values/censoring/discontinuations  
Missing  data due to missed  visits  or early  study  withdrawal  will be addressed using  multiple  imputation of missing  
data and results  from the multiply -imputed  data sets combined using the Rubin method.  
Treatment  groups  will be compared as-randomized using the intention- to-treat principle.  
 
10.4.4  Supportive  analyses  
The mean treatment  effect  estimate  with 95% CI will also be reported  from the model  without  baseline  AASS7  
covariate.  Departures  from a normal  distribution will be addressed using  data transformations  such  as the 
logarithm,  square root, or other  power  transformation,  and nonparametric  regression  methods  will also be 
considered.  Analyses  of longitudinal  AAS measurements  obtained monthly  during  the treatment  period and at the 
9 month follow  up visit will be examined using  linear  mixed  effect  models.  
 
10.5 Analysis of secondary  objectives 
10.5.1  Efficacy  (secondary)  
The effect  of treatment  compared to placebo on the change in IAE severity from baseline to the end of the 
treatment  period as recorded on a 0-100 visual  analog scale  will be estimated  using  ANCOVA with treatment  group 
and baseline  AAS severity  as covariates.  The treatment  effect  on the change in AE-QoL will be estimated using 
similar  models  with treatment  group and baseline AE-QoL as covariates.  The change  in frequency  of IAE episodes  
and their total duration in hours  (frequency  x duration)  will be 
compared using similar  baseline- adjusted  models.  The occurrence (any vs none)  and frequency  of urgent  care visits,  
ER visits,  rescue medication  and corticosteroid  use will be compared  using similar  baseline - adjusted  generalized 
linear  models  including  logistic  regression  for occurrence and count  regression  such  as Poisson  or negative binomial  
regression  for frequency  variables  as appropriate.  Laboratory  measurements  including CD63  and CD203  basophil  
expression,  tryptase,  bradykinin and its degradation  products,  and platelet  activating factor  (PAF)  will be compared 
using  similar  baseline -adjusted models.  
Measurements  obtained longitudinally  during the treatment  period and at the 9 month follow  up visit will be 
compared between groups  using  (generalized)  linear  mixed  effect  models.  
 
10.6 Sample size calculation  
Based on estimated  (Weller  et al. Allergy  2013)  AAS7  standard deviations  at baseline and at 6 months  of 9.5 and 
a correlation of 0.5 between them,  we estimate  the standard deviation for the baseline to 6 month change as (2 x 
9.52 x (1-0.5))1/2 =9.5.  Under  this assumption,  enrolling  20 subjects  per group will provide an estimate  of the size 
of the treatment  effect - the difference in the baseline to 6 month change  between treatment  and placebo groups - 
with a margin  of error  (half-width  of 95% CI) of 6.1. Based  on a chart  review  of patients  followed  for a diagnosis  in 
the UW Health  Allergy  Clinics,  we estimate  100 patients  will meet  inclusion  criteria.  Given the additional  988 
patients  seen in non-Allergy  clinics,  we expect  the recruitment  of 40 subjects  is feasible.  
25 
 10.7 Power  for analysis of critical  secondary  variables  
Assuming  an IAE severity  (0-100 visual  analog scale)  change from baseline standard deviation of 
13.8 (Cicardi,  M et al, 2010),  we estimate  enrolling 20 participants  per group will provide an estimate  of the 
treatment  effect  with a margin  of error of 8.8. Assuming an AE-QoL change from baseline  standard deviation of 
15 (Weller  et al Allergy  2012),  we estimate  enrolling 20 participants  per group  will provide an estimate  of the 
treatment  effect  with a margin  of error of 9.6. 
 
 
11 Ethical considerations  
11.1 Regulatory  and ethical  compliance  
This clinical  study  was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized 
Tripartite  Guidelines  for Good Clinical Practice,  with applicable local regulations  (including  European Directive  
2001/20/EC,  US Code  of Federal  Regulations  Title 21, and Japanese Ministry  of Health,  Labor,  and Welfare),  and 
with the ethical  principles  laid down in the Declaration  of Helsinki.  
 
11.2 Informed consent  procedures 
Eligible  patients  may only be included in the study  after providing written  (witnessed,  where required by law or 
regulation),  IRB/IEC/REB- approved informed  consent,  or, if incapable of doing so, after such  consent  has been 
provided by a legally  acceptable representative of the patient.  In cases  where the patient’s  representative gives  
consent,  the patient  should be informed  about  the study  to the extent  possible given his/her  understanding.  If the 
patient  is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent  by personally  signing and dating  the written  informed  
consent  document  or a separate  assent  form.  
Informed consent  must  be obtained before conducting  any study -specific  procedures  (i.e. all of the procedures  
described in the protocol).  The process  of obtaining informed consent  should be documented  in the patient  source 
documents.  
Women  of child bearing potential  should be informed that taking the study  medication  may involve  unknown risks to 
the fetus  if pregnancy  were  to occur  during the study  and agree that in order  to participate in the study  they must  
adhere to the contraception  requirement  for the duration of the study.  If there is any question that the patient  will 
not reliably  comply,  they should not be entered in the study.  
 
11.3 Responsibilities  of the investigator  and IRB/IEC/REB  
The protocol  and the proposed informed  consent  form must  be reviewed and approved by a properly  constituted 
Institutional  Review  Board/Independent  Ethics  Committee/Research Ethics  Board  (IRB/IEC/REB)  before study  
start.  A signed and dated statement  that the protocol  and informed  consent  have been approved by the 
IRB/IEC/REB must  be given  to Novartis  before study  initiation.  
 
11.4 Publication of study  protocol  and results 
The University  of Wisconsin -Madison  study  team  will be responsible for all study  data and its analysis.  
The PIs, Dr. Viswanathan and Dr. Mathur,  reserve  the right to prepare all manuscripts,  and scientific  
presentations  of the data at the conclusion  of the study.  All manuscripts  and any form of presentation will 
be sent to Novartis  for pre-approval  prior to public  dissemination.  
This study  is required by law to be listed  on the clinicaltrials.gov  website  for the entire  trial, and for the 
investigators  involved to abide by all of the site rules  and regulations  for dissemination of results  and 
data.  
 
 
 
 
 
26 
 12 Protocol  adherence 
12.1 Protocol  Amendments  
Any change or addition to the protocol  can only be made in a written  protocol  amendment  that must  be 
approved by Novartis,  Health  Authorities  where required,  and the IRB. Only amendments  that are 
required for patient  safety  may be implemented  prior to IRB approval.  Notwithstanding the need for 
approval  of formal  protocol  amendments,  the investigator  is expected to take any immediate  action  
required for the safety  of any patient  included in this study,  even  if this action  represents  a deviation 
from the protocol.

 Instructions  for evaluation of the  AAS 
 
 
AAS scoring system:  
 
The Angioedema Activity  Score  (AAS)  consists of only 5 questions.  The AAS scoring  
system  is very easy.  A score  between 0 and 3 is assigned to every  field that can be 
ticked  by the completing patient.  The fields  ticked  by the patient  are summed up to a 
total score.  Accordingly,  the minimum  and maximum  possible  AAS scores  are 0 and 
15. The answer  to the first question does  not get any points  and is not included in the  
computation of the AAS score.  Please find the score  for each field in the template  
below.  This template is only meant  to be used for the AAS score  calculations.  The 
patients  must  not see this template.

The structure of AE-QoL 
 
The German  version of AE-QoL consists of four dimensions  and a total score:  
 
 
Dimensions   
Item 
 
 
 
Functioning  1. Impairment  of work  
2. Impairment  of physical  activity  
3. Impairment  of spare time activities  
4. Impairment  of social  relations  
 
 
 
 
Fatigue/Mood  6. Difficulties  of falling  asleep 
7. Waking up during the night  
8. Feeling tired during the day 
9. Difficulties  in concentrating  
10. Feeling  downhearted 
 
 
 
 
 
Fears/Shame  12. Feeling burdened at having swellings  
13. Fear of new suddenly  appearing swellings  
14. Fear of increased frequency  of swellings  
15. Ashamed to visit public  places  
16. Embarrassed by the apppearence of swellings  
17. Fear of long term negative drug effects 
 
Nutrition  5. General  limitations  in foods  and eating

Angioedema Quality  of Life Questionnaire  – American English Version 2012

 The AE-QoL scale  scores  as well as the AE-QoL total score  are calculated by using  
the following  formula:  
 
(Σ items  – min Σ items  / max Σ items  – min Σ items) x 100 
 
For example:  Scale  “Functioning”:  
Item 1: answer  3 
Item 2: answer  2 
Item 3: answer  4 
Item 4: answer  5 
Σ items: (3+2+4+5)  = 14 
min Σ items: (1+1+1+1)  = 4 
max Σ items: (5+5+5+5)  = 20 
Enter  values  in formula: (14 - 4 / 20 – 4) x 100 = 62.5%  
 
The AE-QoL scale  scores  correspond to the mean of the items  within  each  scale.  If 
some items  are missing,  the total of the items  within  the scale  is divided  by the 
number  of the non missing  items. The same holds  for the AE-QoL total score.  
 
An AE-QoL scale  score  should not be calculated if more  than one item is missing  in 
that dimension.  The AE-QoL total score  should not be calculated if more  than 25% of 
items  (>4 items) are missing.  
 
Please  not that only calculating the raw scale  scores  (mean of the item scores  within  
each scale)  and the raw total score  score  (mean of all item scores)  would be easier  
than the above described procedure.  However,  in case  of missing  answers,  an 
interindividual  as well as an intraindividual  comparison of AE-QoL results  would  be 
limited.  The above described linear  transformation  of all raw scores  into percentage  
scores  (indicating  the location  of the raw scores  in relation  (in percent)  to its 
maximum  possible  score)  solves  this problem  and makes  it possible  to judge and 
compare AE-QoL results  even when  single items  are missing.   The linear  
transformation  of raw scores  results  in minimal and highest  possible  scale  and total 
scores  of 0 and 100, respectively.

Study Rationale
Brain metastases occur in a significant number of cancer patients , with the incidence being 
highest in lung and breast cancers .  In the United Sta tes (US), the incidence o f brain metastases 
is approximately  5% in breast cancer patients, across genders and breast cancer subt ypes.  
Although targeted anticancer agents have shown promising results in treating extracranial 
disease, delivery of these agen ts to the central  nervous system (CNS) has presented challenges.
Abemaciclib (LY2835219) is an oral, selective,and potent sm all m olecule inhibitor of 
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 ( CDK4/6 )with acceptable physical characterist ics, 
pharmacokinet ic (PK) properti es, and safet y profile in nonclinical species.  Cell-based studi es in 
breast cancer models, which evaluated in vitro growth inhibit ion across a diverse panel o f 
46breast cell lines represent ing the known mo lecular subgroups of breast cancer, indicated that 
abemaciclib inhibits CDK4/6 and induces G1 arrest, specifically in retinoblastoma (Rb) cell lines
with functional Rb .  These studies also showed that sensit ivity to CDK4/6 inhibit ion was greater 
in estrogen receptor posit ive(ER+)lines with luminal histol ogy. Abemaciclib has demonstrated 
acceptable clinical safety  and evidence of single -agent activit y in a tum or-specific cohort of 
wom en wi th horm one receptor posit ive (HR+) metastati c breast cancer in the ongoing Phase 1 
Study  I3Y-MC-JPBA (JPBA ),including patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2) posit ive(HER2+) andHER2 negat ive(HER2-) disease, as well as in a single pat ient 
with CNS target disease .  
In radi olabeled studi es in rats, [14C]LY2835219 -derived radioactivi ty was measurable in CNS
tissues (cerebellum, cerebrum, medulla, and spinal cord) protected by  the blood -brain barrier 
(BBB) through 24 hours after a single dose.   
Abemaciclib has also been shown to inhibit 
glioblastoma intracranial xenografts , result ingin astatist ically significant and dose-dependent 
improvement in survival .  These preclinical resul tsdemonstrating that abemaciclib crosses the 
BBB, as well as the clinical findings from Study  JPBA, support further invest igation of
abemaciclib i
npatients wi th brain metastases secondary  toHR+ breast cancer .  
Study  I3Y-MC-JPBO (JPBO) is a multicenter, open -label, Phase 2trialof abemaciclib in 
patients wi th brain metastases secondary  to HR+ breast cancer.  This study  will eval uate the 
safet y and efficacy of abemaciclib in patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer and new or not 
previously irradiated brain lesio ns as well as previously irradiated progressive brain lesions.

Statistical Methods:  
Statistical:   
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to estimate the antitumor activity, measured by OIRR of abemaciclib 
in patients with brain metastases secondary to HR+ breast cancer.  
Two separate Simon 2 -stage designs will be employed for this s tudy; one will be used for Part A (patients with 
HR+, HER2 + disease) and another for Part B (patients with HR+, HER2 -disease).  Each design assumes a 1-sided 
typeI erro r of 0.05 and 80% power.  
For Part A, up to 56 qualified patients will be enrolled with the pos sibility  of stopping the study early for either 
lack of efficacy or unacceptable toxicity.  Twenty -
three qualified patients will be enrolled in the first stage.  If 
fewer than 2 of the first 23 patients respond to abemaciclib, accrual will be stopped, and the conclusion will be 
drawn that abemaciclib is not worthy of further study in the Part -A population.   If at least 2 of the first 23 patients 
respond to therapy, accrual will continue until 33 additional qualified patients ha ve been enrolled.  A total of 
6responders out of 56 patients in Part A would need to be observed to warrant further investigation of abemaciclib 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 6
LY2835219in this patient population.  
The procedure described above tests the null hypothesis (H 0) that the true OIRR of abemaciclib in Part A is ≤5% 
versus the alternative hypothesis (H a) that the true OIRR is ≥15%.  The probability of early termination of the 
treatment arm under H 0 is 0.68.  
Part B will have the identical design as Part A.  
Efficacy:
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the fullanaly sis set (FAS).  This set includes all data from all enrolled 
patients receiving at least 1dose of abemaciclib .  OIRR will be reported along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
using the normal approximation.   Point estimates and 95% CIs (using the n ormal approximation to the binomial) 
will be calculated for BOIR, IDCR, ICBR, ORR , and DCR for Part A and Part B.   Time-to -event efficacy 
endpoints (OS, PFS, and DOIR) will be summarized for Part A and Part B using Kaplan -Meier techniques if there 
is suffi cient data.  If performed, Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated, and quartiles and point probabilities will 
be calculated.  Interval estimates will be calculated using 95% C Is.
Safety:
Safety  analy ses will be conducted on the FAS.  
Health Outcomes:
Patients with at least 1 baseline and 1 postbaseline assessment will be included in the analyses.  
MDASI -BT data will be summarized for each study part ( Parts AandB)and/orresponse categor y (CR/PR, SD, 
PD); change from baseline and time to worsening will be explored .  This summary will include mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and change from baseline.  The MDASI -BT will be reported as core 
symptoms, brain tumor symptoms, symptom interference, and symptom groupings (affect, cognition , focal 
neurologic deficit, treatment -related symptoms, generalized/disease status symptoms, and gastrointestinal 
symptoms). 
Pharmacokinetic s:  
PKanaly ses will be conducted on all patients who have received at least 1 dose of abemaciclib and have had 
samples collected.   Mean population PK parameters for abemaciclib in plasma (clearance, exposure, volume of 
distribution, and half-lives) and interindi vidual PK variability will be computed using nonlinear mixed effect 
modeling (NONMEM).  Cov ariate effects (such as age, weight, sex, creatinine clearance, and plasma protein 
levels) on the PK parameters of abemaciclib in plasma will also be investigated.   
Pharmacodynamic s:
Pharmacodynamic and/or tailoring biomarker analyses will be based on t he subset of patients from the above 
populatio ns from whom a valid assay result (according to laboratory guideline) has been obtained.   
Pharmacodynamic data (such as neutrophil, lymphocytes ,or platelets counts in blood) collected in this study may 
also be analy zed by  means of NONMEM and connected to the population PK model in a PK/ pharmacodynamic
model.
Explo ratory :
Trail Making Tests A and B :  Summary statistics will be provided fo r Study  Part A and Part B and/or 
response category (CR/PR, SD, PD ); change from baseline and time to worsening will be explored .
NANO Scale :  Clinical response and progression will be explored and summarized for the NANO scale 
using descriptive statistics.
Drug Co ncentrations in Plasma, Cerebrospinal Fluid ,and Resected Tumor Tissue :  The relative 
concentrations of abemaciclib and its metabolites in plasma, CSF, and tumor tissue collected at the time of 
surgical resection for patients participating in Part C will be explored.  Additionally, patients in Part A and 
Part B with PDand surgical resection clinically indicated may consent to provide samples for this 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 7
LY2835219exploratory analysis.   
Biomarkers :  Summary statistics for biomarkers with continuous measures will include means, medians,
corresponding standard errors, quartiles, and ranges. Biomarkers with discrete measures will be 
summarized in frequency tables. Correlative analyses may be performed to investigate associations 
between biomarkers and clinical endpoints .

LY2835219A Phase 2 Study  of A bemaciclib in Patients with Brain 
Metastases Secondary  to Hormone Receptor Positive Breast 
Cancer
5.Introduction
Brain metastases occur in a significant number of cancer patients , with the incidence being 
highest in lung and breast cancers .  In the United States (US) , the incidence o f brain metastases 
is approximately  5% in breast cancer patients, across genders and breast cancer subt ypes 
(Davi set al. 2012).  However, in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) posit ive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer, approximately 30 % to 55% of patients will 
develop brain metastases (Lin et al .2013).  Current standard- of-care treatm ent options include 
whole brain r adiotherapy (WBRT) , surg ical resect ion, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).  
Though surgery  and radi otherapy  are effective in palliat ing neurological symptoms, these 
therapi es are associ ated wi th neurocogni tive deficits (Lin et al.2013), and the prognosi s for 
patients remainspoor. The m edian overall survival (OS) of patients wi th brain metastases 
secondary  to breast cancer is 13.8 months (Sperduto et al . 2012).  However, with recent 
improvements in systemic disease control in pat ients wi th estrogen receptor (ER) posit ive (ER+), 
HER2+ di sease the m edian OSis approximately 2 years (Lin et al. 2013).  Although targeted 
anticancer agents have shown pro mising results in treating extracranial disease, delivery o f these 
agents to the central nervous system (CNS) has presented challenges (Adamo et al . 2011). The 
blood -brain barrier (BBB) arises fro m both a structural barrier and drug efflux transporters that 
may prevent m ost anti cancer drugs from efficient ly reaching brain tumors o r metastases , though 
the BBB m ay be parti ally com promised at the m etastati c site, enabling the delivery  of som e 
drugs to the tumor site (Deeken and Loscher 2007).
During the cell cycle, the G1 restrict ion point con trols entry  into S phase and is essent ial for 
proper regulat ion of cell proliferat ion (Sherr 1996; Ortega et al. 2002).  Cyclin-dependent 
kinases 4 and 6 (hereafter referred to as CDK4/6 )participate in a co mplex with the D ty pe 
cyclins to init iate progression through the G1 restriction point.  The CDK4/6 –cyclin D1 
complex regulates the G1 restriction point through phosphorylat ion and inact ivation of the 
retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein, thereby promoting S phase entry .  Alterati ons in 
this pathway occur frequent ly in human cancers and invo lve 1) loss of funct ional CDK inhibitors 
through delet ion or epi genet ic silencing, 2) activating mutations and/or overexpressio n of 
CDK4/6 or the D ty pe cyclins, and 3) loss of funct ional Rb through mutation or delet ion.  Except 
for tum ors wi th functional loss of Rb, which funct ions downstream of the CDK4/6 –cyclin D1 
complex, m ost cancers are potentially  sensi tive to pharmaco logic inhibit ion of CDK4/6.  From a 
therapeuti c standpo int, the goal o f inhibit ing CDK4/6 with a small mo lecule is to preven t cell  
cycle progressi on through the G1 restrict ion point, thus arresting tumor growth.  
Abemaciclib (LY2835219) represents a select ive and potent small mo lecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 
with acceptable physical characterist ics, pharmacokinet ic (PK) properties , and safet y profile in 
nonclinical species.  Cell-based studi es in breast cancer models have demonstrated that 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 21
LY2835219abemaciclib inhibits CDK4/6 to induce G1 arrest specifically in cell lines with functi onal Rb
versus lines which lack funct ional Rb.  These studies, which evaluated in vitro growth inhibit ion 
across a diverse panel of 46 breast cell lines represent ing the known mo lecular subgroups of 
breast cancer, indicated that sensit ivity to CDK4/6 inhibi tion was greater in ER +lines with 
luminal histology . Abemaciclib shows ant itumor activit y in additional nonclinical models of 
multiple human cancers including, but not limited to, colorectal cancer, glio blastoma mult iforme, 
acute myelo id leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer , and mantle cell lympho ma. In radi olabeled 
studi es in rats, [14C]LY2835219 -derived radioactivi ty was measurable in CNS tissues 
(cerebellum, cerebrum ,medulla, and spinal cord) protected by the BBB through 24 hours 
postdose after a single dose .  Abemaciclib has also been shown to inhibit glioblastom a 
intracranial  xenografts , resul tingin astatistically significant and dose-dependent improvement in 
survival (Sanchez -Martinez et al.2011).  
In the ongoing Phase 1 Study  I3Y-MC-JPBA (JPBA) abemaciclib has demonstrated acceptable 
safet y across 5 tumor-specific cohorts at the maximum tolerated dose of 200 mg every 12 hours. 
The most commo n treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) possibly  related to study  drug 
includ eddiarrhea, nausea, fat igue, vo miting, and neutropenia.  Abemaciclib has also
demonstrated evi dence o f clinical act ivity inwomen withhorm one receptor posi tive (HR+)
metastati c breast cancer , including pat ients with HER2+ and HER2 negat ive(HER2-) disease, as 
well as in a single pat ient with CNS target di sease .  
These clinical resul ts, as well as the 
preclinical findings demonstrating that abemaciclib crosses the BBB, support further 
investigat ion ofabemaciclib in pat ients with brain metastases secondary  to HR+ breast cancer.   
The Phase 2 Study  I3Y-MC-JPBO (JPBO) will eval uate the safet y and efficacy of abemaciclib in 
patients with HR+ metastati c breast cancer and new or not previously irradiated brain lesio ns as 
well as previ ously  irradiated progressive brain lesions.
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks , and reasonably anticipated 
adverse events (AEs) of abemaciclib may be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).  
Inform ation on AEs expected to be related to abemaciclib may be found in Section 7 
(Development Core Safet y Inform ation[DCSI ]) of the IB.  Information on serious adverse 
events (SAEs) expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and that will be 
assessed by  the sponsor in aggregate periodically  during the course of the study  may be found in 
Secti on6 (Effects in Humans) of the IB.

7.3.3. Discontinuation from the Study 
Patients will  be discont inued fro m the study  in the fo llowing circumstances:
the pati ent or the pati ent’s designee (for example, legal guardian) requests that the patient 
be wit hdrawn fro m the study .  
Lilly stops the study  or stops the patient’s participation in the study  for medical, safety , 
regul atory , or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and good 
clinical practice (GCP) .  
7.3.4. Patients who are Lost to Follow -Up
A pat ient willbe considered lost to fo llow-up if he or she repeatedly  fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be con tacted by  the study  site.  Site personnel are expected to make 
3diligent attempts (by telephone and/or email )to contact pati ents who fail to return for a 
scheduled visit or who the site is otherwi se unable to follow.   
7.3.5. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study  site parti cipat ion may be discont inued if Lilly , the invest igator, or the ethical review board 
(ERB) of the study  site judges discont inuation of  study  site parti cipat ion necessary  for m edical, 
safet y, regul atory , ethi cal, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and

8.1. Summary of Study Design
Study  JPBO is a mult icenter, open -label, Phase 2trialof abemaciclib in pat ients with brain 
metastases secondary to HR+breast cancer.
The study  will consist of a total o f 3 parts ; 2of these parts will each accrue as few as 23patients 
or as m any as 56patients with metastatic breast cancer and at least 1new or not previously  
irradi ated brain lesio n or at least 1progressive previously irradiated brain lesio n. These 2 parts 
will include pat ients with HR+, HER2+ breast cancer (Part A) and HR+, HER2 -breast cancer
(Part B). For pat ients in Part A and Part B w ith PD, if surgical resection of brain lesio ns is 
clinically indicated fo llowing di sease progressi on, these pati ents m ay consent to provide brain 
tumor tissue and cont inue on abemaciclib for up to 14 addit ional days until the time of scheduled 
surgery .
The third part (Part C) will include approximately 8breast cancer patients with eit her HR+, 
HER2+ or HR+, HER2 -disease who have 1 to3 intracranial lesio ns and for whom surgical 
resection is clinically  indicated in order to assess concentrati onsof abema ciclib and its 
metabo litesin plasma , CSF, and brain tumor tissue.   These patients may resume abemaciclib 
dosing at least 15 days but no greater than 21 days postoperatively and continue until 1 of the 
criteria for discont inuat ion is met(refer to Section 7.3).  In except ional cases, in consultat ion 
with the Lilly CRP, a pati ent m ay resume dosing more than 21 days postoperatively .  These 
exceptional cases will  not be considered protocol vio lations.

LY2835219*For patients in Part A and Part B with PD , if surgi cal resection of brain lesions is 
clinically indicated following disease progression, these patients may consent to 
provide brain tumor tissue and continue on abemaciclib for up to 14 additional days 
until the time of scheduled surgery .

Terms used to describe the periods during the study are defined below:
Baseline:   begins when the informed consent form ( ICF) is signed and ends at the first 
study  treatm ent (or at discont inuat ion, if no treatment is given) .  
Study Period:   begins at the first study treatment and ends at study  com pletion.The 
study  period does not i nclude the continued access period .  
oStudy Treatment Period :  begins at the first study treatment and ends when the 
patient and the invest igator agree that the patient will no longer continue 
abemaciclib .  The date of this agreement is to be reported on the electronic case 
report form ( eCRF )as the Date of Discont inuat ion fro m abemaciclib .
oPostdiscontinuation Follow -Up:  begins the day  after the pati ent and the 
investigator agree that the patient will no longer cont inue abemaciclib .
Short -term follow -upbegins the day after the pati ent and the invest igator 
agree that the patient will no longer continue abemaci clib and l asts 
approximately  30days.  

I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 30
LY2835219Long -term follow -upbegins theday after short -term follow-up is 
completed and continues unt il the patient’s death or overall study  
completion.
Continued Access Period:   begins after study  complet ion and ends at the end of trial.  
During the continued access period,patients on abem aciclib who con tinue to experience 
clinical benefit and no undue risks may cont inue to receive abemaciclib until 1of the 
criteria for di scont inuat ion is met.  The continued access period includes continued 
access follow-up.
oContinued Access Follow -Up:  begins theday after the pati ent and the 
investigator agree that the patient will no longer cont inue abemaciclib in the 
continued access period and lasts approximately  30days.
8.1.1. Study Completion and End of Trial
The primary  analysis of OIRR for each study  Part (Part A or Part B) will occur 6 months after up 
to 56 patients have been enrolled in toeach respect ive part. This is to ensure that adequate 
durabilit y of response data is available at the time of analysis. Invest igators will cont inue to 
follow the study  schedule for all pat ients unt il notified by Lilly  that study  com pletion has 
occurred.  
“End of trial” refers to the date of the last visit or last scheduled proce dure for the last patient.
The end o f trial occurs after study  com pletion and after the last patient has discont inued study  
treatm entand completed any applicable continued access follow-up ( Figure JPBO.2).

8.1.2. Continued Access Period 
The continued access period will apply  to this study  only if at least 1 patient is st ill on 
abemaciclib when study  com pletion occurs .
Patients receiving abemaciclib and experie ncing ongo ing clinical benefit and no undue risks may 
continue to receive abemaciclib in the continued access period unt il 1 of the cri teria for 
discontinuat ion is met (Section 7.3).  Lilly will notify  investi gators when the continued access
period begins .  
Patients who are in short -term follow-up when the continued access period begins will continue 
in short -term follow-upuntil the 30 -day short -term fo llow-up visit is co mpleted.  Long -term 
follow-up does not apply.   
Patients who are in long -term follow-up when the continued access period begins will be 
discontinued fro m long-term follow-up.  
During the continued access period, a ll AEs, SAEs, and abemaciclib exposure will be reported 
on the eCRF.  SAEs will also be reported to Lilly Global Patient Safet y (see Section 10.3.1 ).  In Continued Collection of OS Data

resul ts, concomi tant m edicat ions, and hospitalizat ions) in order to evaluate the reported SAE.
Invest igators will perform an y other standard procedures and tests needed to treat and evaluate 
patients; however, the choice and timing of the tests will be at the in vestigator’s di scret ion.  Lilly
will not routinely co llect the results of these assessments.
8.2. Discussion of Design and Control
A nonrando mized, uncontrolled design is being used in this study .  Although this design has 
known inferent ial deficiencies, thi s desi gn is just ified for this study for the fo llowing reasons:
1. T here is no approved chemotherapeut ic option for these patients .
2. T he primary endpo int in this study  is intracranial tumor response, observat ion of which is 
putative evidence of ant itumor effect of abemaciclib .
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 33
LY28352199.Treatment
9.1. Treatments Administered
Abemaciclib 200 mg will be administered orally every  12(± 2) hours on Day s 1 through 21of a 
21-day cycle .
Table JPBO .
1shows the treatment regimen.
Table JPBO .1. Treatment Regimens/Dosing Schedule
Regimen Period/Cycle Dose 
Abemaciclib Treatment/21 -day cycle 200mg Q12H PO on Days 1 –21 of a 
21-day  cycle
Abbreviations:  PO = orally; Q12H = once ever y 12 (± 2) ho urs.  
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for the fo llowing:   
explaining the correct use of abemaciclib and pl anned durati on of  each individual’s 
treatm ent to the patient/site personnel/legal representative,
verifying that instructions are fo llowed properly, 
maintaining accurate records of abema ciclib dispensing and collect ion, 
and returning all unused abemaciclib to Lilly or its desi gnee at the end of the study .  
Note : In some cases, sites may destroy  the m aterial  if, during the invest igator site select ion, the 
evaluator has verified and documented that the site has appropriate facilit ies and wri tten 
procedures to dispose of clinical trial materials.   
Patients will  be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if they have a complaint 
or probl em with abemaciclib so that the si tuation can be assessed.   
9.2. Materials and Supplies
Abemaciclib will be supplied by  Lilly as capsules for oral  administrati on. The capsules should 
be stored at room temperature according to the range provided on the product label and not 
opened, crushed, or disso lved. Investigators should instruct patients to store the capsules in the 
original  package and in a locat ion inaccessible t o children. Abemaciclib will be labeled 
according to country  regul atory  requi rements.
9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
Upon ob taining informed consent, site personnel should access the interactive web -response 
system  (IWRS) which will assign a patient number.  The IWRS will be used to assign 
abemaciclib to patients who m eet all  criteria f or enrollment in1 of 3 study  parts:
Part A:patients with HR+, HER2+ breast cancer
Part B:patients with HR+, HER2- breast cancer
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 34
LY2835219Part C:  patients with either HR+, HER2+ or HR+, HER2 -breast cancer with 1to
3 intracranial lesio ns and for whom surgical resect ion is clinically indicated .
The peri od between assignment to abemaciclib in IWRS and the first dose (Cy cle 1, Day  1) 
shoul d not exceed 7 days.
9.4. Selection and Timing of Doses
Abemaciclib will be taken orally every  12 (± 2) hours on Days 1 through 21 of a 21- day cycle, 
for a total  of 42doses per cy cle. During all cycles, abemaciclib should be taken at 
approxim ately  the same t imes each day. If a patient misses or vomits a dose, that dose should be 
omitted.
A cycle is defined as an interval of 2 1days pl us any  subsequent del ay pri or to start of the next 
cycle. A delay  in the start of a cy cle due to holidays, weekends, bad weather, or other 
unforeseen circumst ances will be permitted up to 7 days and not counted as a protocol deviation . 
In exceptional cases, for planned delays (including but not limited to vacation or holidays), 
additional abemaciclib may be di spensed.   
A pat ient may cont inue to receive abemaciclib until shemeets 1 or more of the specified reasons 
for discont inuat ion (as described in Sect ion7.3).
9.4.1. Special Treatment Considerations
9.4.1.1. Dose Adjustments and Delays
9.4.1.1.1. Dose Adjustments
Abemaciclib dose adjustments ,as outlined in Table JPBO .2,are allowed both within a cycle and 
between cy cles.  
Abemaciclib must be r educed sequent ially by 1 dose level .  
For pati ents requi ring dose reduction(s), any reescal ation to a prior dose level is permi tted only  
afterconsultation wit h the Lilly CRP .  
Table JPBO .2. Dose Adjustments of Abemaciclib forStud yI3Y-MC- JPBO
DoseAdjustment OralDose Frequency
0 200 mg Every 12hours
1 150 mg Every 12hours
2 100 mg Every 12hours
Abemaciclib must be discont inued if further dose reduction is required beyo nd 100 mg every 
12hours.  
9.4.1.1.2. Dose Suspension (within a Cycle) and Cycle Delay
Both abemaciclib dose suspensio n (wi thin a cycle) and cycle delay are permitted up to 14 days to
allow sufficient time for recovery  from atoxicit y (defined as an AE possibly related to 
abemaciclib per the invest igator ’sjudgment).   Patients not rec overing fro m toxicity within 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 35
LY283521914days shoul d be considered for discont inuat ion of abemaciclib .  In excep tional circumstances, 
a del ay >14 days is permitted upon agreement between the invest igator and the Lilly CRP , and 
abemaciclib dose adj ustment i s to be considered.   
In the event of a cycle delay  due to logisticalreasons (for example, due to patient avail ability), 
the pati ent shoul d cont inue on abemaciclib if the pati ent has adequate drug supply.  If a patient’s 
treatm ent is interrupted as a result of not having sufficient drug supply, the cycle may be delayed 
up to 7 days (and not be considered a protocol violation ).In except ional circumstances, a delay 
>7days is permitted upon agreement between the investigator and the Lilly CRP . 
An interrupti on in Cycle 1 dosing or a delay in the init iation of Cycle 2 may occur in order to 
allow pat ients participat ing in Part C to undergo surgical resect ion.  For addit ional informat ion, 
refer to Section 9.6.2 .  
9.4.1.1.3. Hematologic Toxicity
If a patient experiences Grade 4 hematol ogic toxi city, then dosing mustbe suspended (unt il the 
toxicity resolves to ei ther baseline or at least Grade 2),andthe dose of abemaciclib must be 
reduced by 1 dose l evel as outlined in Table JPBO .2.
Before the start of each cycle, hematologic toxicit y must resol ve to ei ther baseline or at least 
Grade 2.  
9.4.1.1.4. Nonhematologic Toxicity
If a patient experiences ≥Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicit y, then dosing must be suspended (unt il 
the toxicit y resolves to either baseline or at least Grade 1)
,andthe dose of abemaciclib must be 
reduced by 1 dose l evel as outlined in Table JPBO .2.  
If a patient experience s persistent or recurrent Grade 2 nonhematologic toxicit y (except diarrhea; 
refer to Section 9.4.1.1.4.1 )that does not resolve wit h maximal supportive measures within 
7daysto either baseline or at least Grade 1, then dosing may be suspended (unt il the toxicit y
resolves to either baseline or at least Grade 1)
,and the dose of abemaciclib may be reduced by 
1dose l evel asoutlined in Table JPBO .2at the discretion of the investigator.   
Before the start of each cycle, nonhematologic toxicit y (except al opecia and fati gue) m ust 
resolve to either baseline or at least Grade 1.
9.4.1.1.4.1. Diarrhea
A patient experiencing diarrhea requi ring hospi talizati on (irrespect ive o f grade) or severe 
diarrhea (Grade 3 or 4 ) musthave dosing suspended ( until the toxicit y resolves to either baseline 
orat least Grade 1) and must have the abemaciclib dose reduced by 1 dose level as outlined in
Table JPBO .2.  
If a patient experience s persistent or recurrent Grade 2 diarrhea that does not resolve with 
maximal s upportive measures (refer to Section 9.6.5 )within 3 days to either baseline or at least
Grade 1, then dosing shoul dbe suspended (unt il the toxicit y resolves to either baseline or at least 
Grade 1)
,and the dose of abemaciclib may be reduced by  1dose l evel as outlined in
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 36
LY2835219Table JPBO .2at the discretion of the invest igator.   If the same dose level was resumed and 
Grade 2 diarrhea recurs despite maximal supportive measures, the dose mustbe reduced by 
1dose l evel as outlined in Table JPBO .2.  
9.5. Blinding
This is an open -label study .
9.6. Concomitant Therapy
Appropriate documentation of all forms of premedicat ions, supportive care, and concomitant 
medicat ions m ust be captured at each visit in the 
eCRF.  Concomitant medicat ions and 
supportive care therapies must also be docum ented at the time of discontinuation and at the 
30-day short -term follow -up visit.   
With the exceptions listed in the sect ions below, no other chemotherapy, experimental 
medicat ions, other anticancer therapy , immunotherapy , radi ation, surgery  for cancer, or 
experimental medicat ions will be permitted while patients are on abemaciclib .  Use of megestrol 
acetate as an appetite stimulant is not permitted.
In vivo in humans , abemacicl ib is extensively  metabo lized through oxidat ion.  A dditionally , the 
resul ts from an in vit rohuman recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) phenotyping study indicate 
that oxidative metabo lism of abemaciclib is primarily  catalyzed by CYP3A4. Based on these
findi ngs, grapefruit juice as well as inducers and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be 
subst ituted or avoided if possible (Attachm ent 10 ).  Concurrent treatment with EIAED is not 
permitted while on abemaciclib.  Patients requiring treatment with antiepileptic drugs shoul d be 
prescribed a non -EIAED (eg, leveti racetam , lacosamid e, lamotrigine, etc).  Although 
dexamethasone is a CYP3A4 inducer, use during the study  is allowed.  The dose of 
corticosteroi ds, including dexamethasone, will be captured throughout the study , with an 
emphasis on recording changes in dose at the time of i ntracranial tumor assessments.   
In addit ion, in vitro studi es in primary cultures of human hepatocy tes indicate that abemaciclib 
and its significant metabo lites LSN2839567 and LSN3106726 down regulate mRNA of 1 or 
more CYPs including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C 8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A at 
clinically relevant concentrations.  The mechanism of down regulat ion and i ts clinical relevance 
are present ly not understood.   Therefore, caution should be exercised when coadministering 
substrate drugs of the above CYPs wi th narrow therapeuti c margin.
9.6.1. Endocrine and HER2 -Directed Therapies
Patients receiving endocrine therapy  prior to study  entry may cont inue to receive the same 
endocrine therapy throughout the study  treatm ent peri od per the respective label provi ded that  
extracranial disease isstable for at least 3 months and intracranial disease progression has 
occurred while on this endocrine therapy .  If these condi tions are not m et, pati ents m ust 
discontinue endocrine therapy  prior to ini tiation of abemaciclib.   Pati ents may not ini tiate 
endocrine therapy  immediately  prior to study  entry or at any  time during the study .  Addit ionally, 
patients wi th HER2+ di sease receiving trastuzumab prior to study  entry  and receiving clinical 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 37
LY2835219benefit may cont inue to receive trastuzuma b per the l abel throughout the study  treatment peri od.  
Changes in these conco mitant therapi es after study entry  are not permitted.  Patients requiring a 
change in conco mitant therapy  shoul d be assessed for PD and be discont inued fro m abemaciclib .
9.6.2. Surgery 
A pat ient in Part C with 1 to 3 brain lesio ns for whom  surgical  resecti on is clinically  indicated 
may undergo surgery  following 5 to 14 days of treatm ent wi th abemaciclib . Abemaciclib should 
be taken 6 to 12 hours prior to surgical resect ion of brain les ions in order to accommodate 
assessment of drug concentrations in tumor tissue.  These patients may resume abemaciclib 
dosing at least 15 days but no greater than 21 days postoperatively to allow adequate time for 
wound healing.  Patients requiring subsequent WBRT or SRS must be permanent ly discont inued 
from abemaciclib .  
For pati ents in Part A and Part B with PD, if  surgical  resect ion of brain lesio ns is clinically 
indicated fo llowing disease progression, these patients may consent to provi de brain tumor tissue 
and cont inue on abemaciclib fo llowing PD for up to 14 addit ional days until the time of 
scheduled surgery .  The final  dose of abemaciclib shoul d be taken 6 to 12 hours prior to surgical 
resection o f brain lesio ns in order to accommodate assessment of drug concentrations in tumor 
tissue.  Following surgery , these pat ients must be permanent ly discont inued fro m abemaciclib 
treatm ent.
9.6.3. Supportive Care
Patients shoul d receive full supportive care to maximize qualit y of life. Patients will  receive 
supportive care as judged by their treating physician.  If it is unclear whether a therapy should be 
regarded as supportive care, the invest igator should consult the Lilly CRP .  Use of any 
supportive care therapy  shoul d be reported o n the eCRFs .  
9.6.4. Growth Factor
Growth factors may be administered in accordance with American Society  of Clinical Onco logy
(ASCO )guidelines (Smit h et al . 2006; Rizzo et al . 2008).   
9.6.5. Supportive Management for Diarrhea
In the event of diarrhea, supportive mea sures should be init iated as early as possible .  These 
include the fo llowing:
At the first sign o f loose stools, the patient should init iate antidiarrheal therapy  (eg,
loperamide) and notify the investigator for further instructions and appropriate 
follow-up.
Site personnel should assess response within 1 to 3days.
If diarrhea does not resolve with ant idiarrheal therapy  within 3days to ei ther baseline or 
Grade 1, then dosing should be adjusted as outlined in Section9.4.1.1 andTable JPBO .
2.  
Patients shoul d also be encouraged to drink fl uids (e g, 8 to 10 glasses of clear liquids per 
day).
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 38
LY28352199.7. Treatment Compliance
Patient com pliance with abemaciclib dosing will be assessed by  capsule counts at each visit, with 
the number of capsules taken relat ive to the number expected to be taken summarized for each 
cycle. The patient must take ≥75% of the planned doses of abemaciclib in a cycle to be deemed 
compliant. As outlined in Sect ion 9.4.1.1.2 , dose suspensio ns or delays may occur and will not 
resul t in a pat ient being considered as nonco mpliant. A patient may be considered nonco mpliant 
if she is judged by  theinvest igator to have intentionally  or repeatedly  taken ≥125% of the 
planned doses of abemaciclib in a cycle.
Apatientenrolled in Part C who undergoes resection of brain metastases willnot be considered 
nonco mpliant for doses of abemaciclib withheld in conjunct ion with surgery and willnot incur a 
protocol  deviat ion. For addi tional information, refer to Section 9.6.2 .

LY283521910.Efficacy , Health Outcome/Quality  of Life Measur es, Safety  
Evaluations , Sample Collection and Testing, and 
Appropriateness of Measurements
Written inform ed consent m ust be obtained pri or to any  study -specific pretreatment evaluations. 
Study  procedures rel ated to efficacy, safet y, heal th outcom e/qualit yof life measures, sample 
collect ion,and testing assessments and their timing are described in the sect ions below and 
shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  
10.1. Efficacy Measures 
10.1.1. Efficacy Assessments at Baseline and during Study Treatment
Within 28days before the first dose of abemaciclib , baseline tum or measurements will be 
perform ed for each pat ient.  Intracranial tumor assessments will be per formed by Gd -MRI 
according to brain metastases response criteria (Attachm ent 5 ). Extracranial tumor assessments 
willbe perform ed according to RECIST v1.1 (Attachment 6) .  Computed tomography (CT)
scans , including spiral CT scans ,and magnet ic resonance imaging ( MRI )are the preferred 
methods of measurement of extracranial disease.   
For pati ents wi th progressive intracranial disease, Gd -MRI acquired prior to study screening 
must be provi dedto confirm PDon the baseline intracranial tumor assessment.  Addit ionally , in 
order to document stable extracranial disease for patients receiving conco mitant endocrine 
therapy , CT scan or MRI of extracranial lesio ns acquired at least3monthsprior to study  
screening must be provi ded.  
The m ethod of assessment used at baseline must be used consistent ly for tum or assessment and 
will be repeated between Day 14 and Day 21 of every  other cy clebeginning wit h Cycl e2 and 
continuing through Cy cle8; thereafter ,tumor assessmen ts will  be repeated between Day 14 and 
Day 21 of  every  fourth cycle (beginning wit h Cycle 12). 
Intracranial and extracranial r esponses ( CR or PR ) must be confirmed no less than 28 days fro m 
the first evidence of response .
During the con tinued access period , efficacy assessments (frequency and ty pe of assessments) 
will be completed at the discret ion of the investigator.  
10.1.2. Efficacy Assessments during the Study Period 
Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up
Postdiscontinuati on follow-up during the study  period will be conducted as described in the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). 
For those patients who discont inue abemaciclib without obj ectiv ely measured PD, the 
investigat ive sites will cont inue to monitor patients and periodically evaluate tumor response 
approximately  every  6weeks for the first 6 months following init iation of abemaciclib and 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 40
LY2835219thereafter approximately  every  12weeks by the sa me method used at baseline and throughout the 
study  until  the pat ient has object ive disease progressio n, or until the final analysis o f OS.  If a 
patient’s m ost recent response prior to discont inuatio n is a PR or CR, an addit ional radio logical 
assessment s hould be perform ed during the 30- day fo llow-up peri od to confi rm the response, at 
least 28 day s after the previous radiological assessment.  R esponse should be confirmed before 
the init iation of addit ional ant icancer therapy .  However, init iation of new th erapy  shoul d not be 
delayed so lely to confirm response.   After the patient has object ive disease progression, 
radiologic tests are no longer required ,and the patient will be fo llowed up approximately  every  
90days until the patient’s death or overall study  complet ion.  
Lilly will cont inue to collect survival data on all patients but may reduce data collection for other 
efficacy  data.  Lilly will notify  investigators when this reduced data collection can begin.   
10.1.3. Primary Efficacy Measure
The primary  efficacy  measure is OIRR ( CR + PR )as defined bybrain metastases response 
criteria (seeAttachm ent 5 ). A partial intracranial response is defined as ≥30% decrease in sum 
of LD of up to 5 target brain lesio nssustained for at least 4 weeks in the absence of progression 
of nonmeasurable brain lesio ns, new brain lesio ns, increased corticoster oid dose, or clinical 
worsening .  
Best response is determined from the sequence o f responses assessed.  
A second assessment must be perform ed ≥28days after the first evidence of response.  
Two objective status determinat ions of CR before progression are required for a best response of 
CR.  Two determinat ions of PR or better before progression, but not qualifying asa CR, are 
requi red for a best response of PR.  Best response of SD is defined as disease that does not meet 
the criteria for CR, PR, or PD and has been eval uated at l east 1 time, at l east 6 weeks after the 
start of abemaciclib . 
Best response will be derived to encompass all tumor assessments from baseline unt il the earliest 
of objective progression or start of new ant icancer therapy .  Any responses observed after 
objective pro gression or the start of new ant icancer therapy are excluded fro m the determinat ion 
of best response.   
The date of first documented object ive disease progressio n must be recorded on the eCRF even if 
it occurs after the patient has started a new therapy.   
Lilly or its desi gnee will  collect and store tum or assessment images , and a n independent review 
of imaging scans maybe perform ed by Lilly  or its designee . 
The OIRR is estimated as the total number of confirmed CRs and PRs divided by the total 
number of patients enrolled .The primary analysis of OIRR for each study  Part (Part A or 
Part B) will occur 6 months after up to 56patients have been enrolled in to each respe ctive part. 
This is to ensure adequate durabilit y of response data is available at the time of analysis.

The fo llowing secondary  efficacy measures ( Table JPBO .3) will be co llected at the times shown 
in the Study  Schedule ( Attachme nt 1).  
Table JPBO .
3. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Endpoint Definition
Best overall intracranial 
response (BOIR)Derived to encompass all tumor assessments (according to brain metastases 
response criteri a) from baseline until the earliest of objective progression
(intracranial or extracranial according to brain metastases response criteri aor 
RECIST v1.1, respectively ) or start of new anticancer therapy. Any responses 
observed after objective progression (intracranial or extracranial) or the start of 
new anticancer therapy are excluded from the determination of best response.   
Each patient ’s BO IR will be categorized as CR, PR, SD, PD, or NE.
Duration of intracranial 
response (DOIR) (CR + PR) Defined only for responders (patients with a confirmed CR or PR, as defined in 
Section 10.1.3 ). It is measured from the date of first evidence of a confirmed 
response (CR or PR as defined by brain metastases response criteri a)to the date 
of investigator -determined objective progression (intracranial or extracranial as 
defined by brain metastases respons ecriteri aor RECIST v1.1 , respectively )or 
death f rom any  cause. Patients who have neither progressed nor died will be 
censored onthe day of their last radiographic tumor assessment (if available) or 
on the date of response (CR or PR as defined by brainmetastases response
criteri a) if no radiographic assessment is available.
Intracranial disease control 
rate ( IDCR) Defined as the proportion of patients with BO IR of CR , PR,or SD ( according to
brain metastases response criteri a).
Intracranial clinical benefit 
rate ( ICBR )Defined as the proportion of patients with BO IR of CR, PR,or SD with duration 
of SD for at least 6 months ( according to brain metastases response criteri a).
Overall survival (OS) Measured f rom the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause. For 
each patient who is not known to have died as of the data -inclusion cutoff date for
a particular analysis, OS will be censored for that analysis at the date of last 
contact prior to thedata inclusion cutoff date (contacts considered in the 
determination of last contact date include AE date, tumo rassessment date, visit 
date, and last known alive date).  Patients will be followed for OS for 18 months 
following the last patient entering treatment in each study part (Parts A or B) .
Objective response rate
(ORR) per RECIST v1.1
and b rain metastases 
response criteriaThe percentage of patients with a best response of CR or PR as defined by 
RECIST v1.1 and brain metastases response criteria .
Disease control rate (DCR) Defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or SD 
(according to RECIST v1.1 and brain metastases response criteria ).
Progression -free survival
(PFS)Measured f rom the date of enrollment to the date of investigator -determined
objective progression (intracranial or extracranial as defined by brain metastases 
response criteri aor RECIST v1.1 , respectively) or death from any cause. Patients 
who have neither progressed nor died will be censored at the day of their last 
radiographic tumor assessment (if available) or date of enrollment if no 
postinitiation (that is, postbaseline) radiographic assessment is available.

The fo llowing exploratory measures ( Table JPBO .4) will be collected at the times shown in the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
Table JPBO .
4. Exploratory Endpoint s
Endpoint Definition
Trail Making Test To assess neurocognitive function using Trail Making Tests A and B. Each test is 
administered by trained site staff and has a time limit (180 seconds for Test Part A 
and 300 seconds for Test Part B).  The score for each test is determined by either 
the time in seconds to complete the test or the last number or letter reached at the
time limit (Reitan 1992 ;Wefel et al. 2011).
NANO scale Clinical assessment of c hange in neurological signs using the NANO scale , which 
consists of 9 domains (gait, strength, ataxia, sensation, visual fields, facial 
strength, language, level of consciousness, and behavior).
Concentration of 
abemaciclib and its 
metabolites To explore the concentration of abemaciclib and its metabolites in plasma, CSF, 
andbraintumor tissue collected at the time of surgical resection for patients 
participating i n Part C, as well as patients in Parts A and B with PD and planned 
surgical resection .
Biomarkers To explore biomarkers related to the mechanism of action of abemaciclib , the cell 
cycle, and/or the pathogenesis of breast cancer .
Abbreviations:  CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; NANO = Neurologic Assessment in Neuro -Oncology ; PD =progr essive

10.2. Health Outcome/Quality of Life Measures
Patient-reported symptoms will be assessed with the self -administered MDASI -BTon paper .  
The MDASI -BT assessment will be co mpleted per the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ). 
The MDASI -BTshoul d be co mpleted at the beginning of office visits, before any extensive 
contact and consultation with the clinician/study  investigator in regards to the tumor 
assessments. Discussio n with the clinician may  bias percepti ons about symptom s and thus aff ect 
assessments.   
TheMDASI -BT will only be co mpleted by  patients for whomthere is a valid trans lation in a 
language in which the patient is fluent.   
10.2.1. Patient -Reported Outcomes
10.2.1.1. MDAnderson Symptom Inventory –Brain Tumor Module
TheMDAS I-BT is a reliable and valid instrum ent to assess symptoms in patients wi thbrain
metastases (including those with brain metastases secondary to breast cancer) (Armstrong et al. 
2009; Meyers and Brown 2006 ).  The MDAS I-BT consists of 22 symptom  items (13 items of the 
core M DASI plus 9 items specif ic to braintumors) plus 6 interference items, all wi th 11- point 
rating scales.  For the symptom items, 0 equals “not present” and 10 equals “as bad as you can 
imagine.”  For the interference items, 0 equals “did not interfere” and 10 equals “interfered 
completely.”  The MDAS I
-BT may be score d by reporting theindividual itemsorbycalcula ting 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 43
LY2835219the means of all symptom items and of all interference items.  The means of the core and brain 
tumor i temsmay be reported separatel y. The 22 sympto m i temsmay also begrouped bytheir 
underlying constructs:  (1) affect; (2) cogni tion; (3) focal neurologic deficit; (4) treatm ent-related 
symptoms; (5) generalized/disease status symptoms; and (6) gastrointes tinalsymptom s.  
10.3. Safety Evaluations
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.   
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.   
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate healt h care option , 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study, or that cause d the patient to discont inue 
before complet ing the study.  The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event is resolved or 
explained.  Frequency  of follow-up evaluati on is left to the di screti on of  the invest igator.   
The timing of all safet y evaluat ions is shown in the Study Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).

10.3.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requi rements that m ay be less stringent.  A clinical study  AE is any untoward medical event 
associ ated wi th the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is consi dered rel ated to that drug.  
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical trials because the purpose of the clinical trial is to 
establish drug effect.   
Any clinically  significant findings from electrocardi ogram s (ECGs) , labs, vi tal sign 
measurements, and other study procedures that resul t ina diagnosis shoul d be reported to Lilly or 
its designee.   
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal exposures to abemaciclib shoul d be reported.  If a 
patient is determined to be pregnant following abemaciclib initiation, she must discontinue 
treatm ent immediately .  Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are co llected for regulatory 
reporting and drug safet y evaluat ion.  
Study  site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing 
conditions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in 
the study .  
After the ICF is signed, site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of any AEs and any 
change in the preexist ing condit ion(s).  All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to 
Lilly or its desi gnee.   
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 45
LY2835219In addit ion, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of abemaciclib must be 
reported to Lilly or its designee via eCRF.  
Invest igators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure and study  drug via eCRF .  
The invest igator will decide whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as related to disease, 
to the study  drug, study  procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.  To assess the 
relationship of the AE to study drug or study procedure, the fo llowing termino logies are defined:   
Probably related :  a di rect cause and effect relat ionship between the study drug and the 
AE is likely
Possibly related :  a cause and effect relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE has 
not been demonstrated at this time and is not probable but is also not impossible
Does not know:   the investigator cannot determine
Not rela ted:  without questi on, the AE is definitely  not associ ated wi th the study  drug
The invest igator should classify all “probably related,” “possibly related,” or “does not know” 
AEs and SAEs as related to study drug or study procedure.   
Patients will  be evaluated for AEs at each visit and will be instructed to call their physician to 
report any  AEs between visit s.  
The National Cancer Inst itute (NCI) -Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events
(CTCAE ) v4.0will serve as the reference document for cho osing appropri ate termino logy for, 
and grading the severit y of, all AEs and other symptom s.  For AEs without matching 
termino logy within the NCI -CTCAE v 4.0 cri teria, the invest igator will be responsible for 
select ing the appropriate System Organ Class (SOC ) and assessing severit y grade based on the 
intensity of the event.   
In addit ion to collect ing the AE verbat im and the CTCAE severit y grade, AE verbat im text will 
also be m apped by Lilly or its designee to corresponding termino logy within the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.   
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly or its desi gnee via eCRF the ci rcumstances and data 
leading to any such dosage reduction or discont inuation of treatment.   
10.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AEfrom this study  that resul ts in 1 of the f ollowing outcom es:  
death
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant di sabili ty/incapacit y
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the invest igator for any other reason
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 46
LY2835219Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi talizati on may  be considered seri ous adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervent ion to prevent 1of the outcom es listed in this definit ion.  
SAE collect ion begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has received 
abemaciclib .  If a patient experi ences an SAE after si gning inform ed consent, but pri or to 
receiving abemaciclib , the event will not be reported as serious unless the inve stigator f eels the 
event m ay have been caused by  a protocol  procedure.   
Data on SAEs that occur before the end of trial will be stored in the collect ion database and the 
Lilly Safety  System .  
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or its desi gnee of  any S AEwithin 24 hours of invest igator 
awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method.  If study  site personnel contact Lilly  or 
its designee by tel ephone regarding an SAE, study  site personnel must al soimmediately provi de 
official notificatio n on study -specific SAE forms.   
This 24 -hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up 
SAE informat ion.  
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .  
Planned hospi talizat ions or procedures for preexisting condit ions that are already recorded in the 
patient’s medical history  at the time of study  enro llment should not be considered SAEs.  
Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion without a preci pitating clinical AE (for 
example, for the administration of abemaciclib or other protocol -requi red procedure) shoul d not 
be considered SAEs.   
SAEs due to disease progression , including death, shoul d not be reported unl ess the investigator 
deems them to be possibl yrelated to the study  drug .  
The invest igator does not need to actively mo nitor pati ents f or AEs once the trial has ended, 
unless provided otherwise in the protocol ; however, i f an invest igator becomes aware of an SAE 
occurring after the patient’ s parti cipat ion in the trial has ended, and the investigator believes that 
the SAE is related to a protocol procedure or study drug , the invest igator should report the SAE 
to the sponsor, and the SAE will be entered in the Lilly Safety  System .  
Inform ation on SAEs expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by  the sponsor in aggregate periodically during the course of the trial may  be 
found in the IB.   
10.3.1.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected un expected seri ous adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the DCSI in the IB and that the invest igator identifies as related to the study  drug or study 
procedure.  US 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 200 1/20/EC and the 
associ ated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory  requirements in parti cipat ing countries 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 47
LY2835219requi re the reporting of SUSARs.  Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and associated 
detailed guidances.   
10.3.2. Other Safety Measures
10.3.2.1. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, a 12-lead di gital ECG will be co llected according to the Study Schedule (see
Attachm ent 1 ).  Patient s must be supine for approximately  5to10minutes before ECG 
collect ion and rem ain supine but awake during ECG collect ion. ECGs may be obtained at 
additional times, ifclinically  indicated .  
ECGs will be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) at the
site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible and ideally  while the patientis still
present for immediate patient management , should any clinically relevant findings be ident ified. 
After enro llment, if a clinically significant increase in th e QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval fro m 
baseline, or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline, is 
present, the invest igator will assess the patientfor symptoms (for example, palpitat ions, near 
syncope, syncope) and to determine if the pat ientcan cont inue in the study .  The invest igator or 
qualified designee is responsible for determining if any  change in patientmanagement i s needed 
and must document his/her review of the ECG print ed at the time of evaluation .  
10.3.2.2. Echocard iograms or M ulti-Gated Acquisition Scans
For only  those pati ents receiving concurrent trastuzumab during the study , an echocardi ogram  or 
multi-gated acquisi tion (MUGA) scan is required within 28 days of init iation of abemaciclib
(Attachm ent 1 ).  Per the trastuzumab prescribing informat ion(Herceptin [ trastuzum ab] 
highlights of prescribing informat ion, 2014 and Herceptin [ trastuzumab ] summary  of product 
characteri stics
, 2014 ), cont inued cardi ac funct ion monitoring throughout treatment is 
recommended but is not required as a protocol procedure.
10.3.3. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP will mo nitor safet y data throughout the course of the study .  
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mand ated by  com pany procedures.  The Lilly CRP
will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally  independent Gl obal Pat ient Safet y 
therapeuti c area physician or clinical scient ist and review:   
trends in safety  data
laboratory  analy tes 
AEs
If a patient experiences elevated ALT or AST >5×ULN and elevated total bilirubin 
>2×ULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring should be initiated by  the invest igator. For 
patients entering the study  with ALT or AST >3×ULN in the presence of liver 
metastases , monitoring shoul d be tri ggered at ALT >2 ×baseline.   
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 48
LY2835219Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed 
laboratory  test abnorm alities.To ensure patient safet y and co mply with regulatory  
guidance, the investigator is to consult w ith the Lilly CRP regarding collect ion of specific 
recommended clinical information and fo llow-up laboratory  tests (See Attachment 3).
10.3.4. Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on study  drug used in clinical trials in order to ensure the safet y 
of study  parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to facili tate process and product improvements.   
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion of the product complaint reported and any associ ated 
AEs using the study -specific co mplaint form s provided for this purpose
faxing the completed product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lilly or its desi gnee
If the invest igator is asked to return the product for invest igation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.   
10.4. Sample Collection and Testing
Attachm ent 1 lists the schedule for sample collect ions in this study.   
Attachm ent 2 lists the specific tests that will be performed for this study and whether these will 
be perform ed at a central  or local laboratory .  
Attachm ent 7 provides a schedule ofECG collect ionand PK sampling during the study for 
patients in Parts A and B .  
Attachm ent 8 provides a schedule ofECG collect ion and PK sampling during the study for 
patients in Part C.
Attachm ent 9 provides a summary o f the estimated maximum number and volume of invasive 
samples, for all sampling, during the study .  
10.4.1. Samples for Study Qualification and Health Monitoring
Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.   
Samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroye d within 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run or to retain the sa mples unt il the end of the study to confirm that the results 
are valid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or l aboratory  certificati on standards.
10.4.2. Samples for Biomarkers 
Requi redsamples for bi omarker research to be collected from all pat ients enrolled in this study  
are the fo llowing:
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 49
LY2835219 whole blood
 plasma
 archived tumor tissue
Analyses may  include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid and protein profiles to better 
understand the disease process and to develop predict ive biomarkers.   Similar analyses may be 
perform ed wi th brain tum or tissue and CSF collected from patients undergoing surgical resect ion
(Secti on 10.4.3.1 ).
These samples are described in the fo llowing sections .
10.4.2.1. Blood Samples for Pharmacogenetic Evaluation s
There i s growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable resp onse to therapy  may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, the disease 
etiology,and/or the molecular subt ype of the di sease being treated.  Therefore, where local 
regul ations and ERBs allo w, a bl ood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenet ic analysis .
Samples may  be genoty ped and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genetic associat ion with 
response or lack of response to abemaciclib .  These invest igations may be limited to a focused 
candidate gene study  or, if appropri ate, genom e-wide analysis may be performed to identify 
regions of the genome associated with the variability  observed in drug response.  The 
pharmacogenet ic biomarker samples wi ll only  be used for invest igations rel ated to di sease and 
drug or class o f drugs under study  in the context of this clinical program.  They  will not be used 
for broad expl oratory  unspecified disease or population genet ic analysis.
The samples will be coded with the pati ent number and stored for up to 15 years after the last 
patient visi t for the study  at a f acilit y selected by  the sponsor.  The samples and any data 
generated fro m them can only  be linked back to th e pati ent by  invest igator site personnel.  T he 
durati on allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory  requests rel ated to abemaciclib .
Samples will  be destroy ed according to a process consistent with local regulat ion.
10.4.2.2. Plasma Samples for Exploratory Biomarker Evaluation s
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA )-anticoagulated plasma samples will be collected and 
analysis may  be perform ed on bi omarkers that m ay play  a rol e in the abemaciclib mechanism o f 
action (refer to Attachment 1 ).  The evaluat ion of these samples may invo lve analysis of DNA, 
RNA, and proteins (including any o f these co mponents derived fro m exoso mes) to invest igate 
their associ ation with observed clinical outcomes to abemaciclib .  The samples will be coded 
with the pati ent number and stored for up to 15 years.  Details for collect ing, processing, and 
storing the samples are similar those provided in Section 10.4.2.1 .
10.4.2.3. Archived Tumor Tissue
For pati ents in the study , a sm all am ount of  archival ,preserved tumor tissue is required to be 
provi ded by sites upon patient assignment to abemaciclib for biomarker research. However, if 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 50
LY2835219thissample is not available for a patient, this should be discussed with the sponsor .  Aprotocol  
deviat ion will not be incurred, and the patient is still eligible for the study .
Available f ormalin-fixed ,paraffin -embedded archived primary  and/or m etastati ctumor tissue 
shoul d be in a whol e block, parti al blo ck, or 20unstained slides, cut at 5 microns, and 
1
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E )slide containing tumor specimen will be requested ,if available ,
to be used for exploratory  analysis.   Due di ligence should be used to make sure that atumor 
specimen (not normal adjacent or tumor margins) is provided.  Pathology  notes accom panying 
archival t issue may also be requested. Tumor blocks or parti al blocks will be sect ioned and 
returned to the investi gator after complet ion of analysis . 
In tum or tissue samples, the CDK4/6 pathway components (for example, Rb and i ts targets ) and 
markers relevant tobreast cancer pathogenesis may be evaluated to assess any potential 
correl ation with response to abemaciclib .  These studi es will be performed in a laboratory  
designated by  the sponsor and m ay include , but are not limit ed to, IHC of proteins, fluorescence 
in-situ hybridizat ion (FISH) for copy  number alterati ons, mRNA gene -expressio n profiling, 
and/or genetic analyses o f the tum or DNA.  Such analyses may  empl oy targeted or 
high-throughput sequencing approaches.  For this purpose, the results of this analysis will be 
correl ated wi th clinical  efficacy data.   
10.4.3. Samples for Drug Concentration Measurements 
Pharmacokinetics 
PK samples will be co llected for Part A and Part B as specified in the Pharm acokineti c Sampling 
Schedule ( Attachment 7 ). A separate Pharmacokinet ic Sampling Schedule ( Attachment 8 ) is 
provi ded for pati ents parti cipat ing in Part C.
At the visit s and t imes specified in the Pharm acokinet ic Sampling Schedule s (Attachm ent 7 and 
Attachm ent 8 ), venous blood samples of approximately 2 mL each will be collected to determine 
the plasma concentrations of abemaciclib and i ts metab olites.
Instructi ons for the collect ion and handling of blood samples will be provided by the sponsor.  It 
is preferred that the blood samples be obtained from a peripheral locat ion.  Bl ood sam ples will  
be allowed fro m central  access devices ,but precaut ions must be taken to prevent obtaining a 
dilute sample when the sample is drawn for PK from a central  catheter of any  type.  If multiple 
samples are obtained centrally , the PK sample shoul d be the l ast specimen drawn to reduce the 
potenti al for a diluted or improperly  drawn sample.  The actual date and time (24 -hour clock 
time) of each sampling will be recorded. A maximum  of 5samples may be drawn at addit ional 
time points during the study  if warranted and agreed upon between both the invest igator and 
Lilly.   
Supplies required for the collect ion and shipment of the samples will be provided by the sponsor.   
Sample handling and shipment to the central laboratory  will occur per instructi ons given to the
study  site.
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 51
LY2835219These samples will be analyzed at a labo ratory  designated by  the sponsor.  Pl asma 
concentrations of abemaciclib andits metabo lites will  be assayed using a validated liquid 
chromatography -tandem  mass spectrom etry(LC/MS/MS) method.
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure abemaciclib concentra tion and metabolism and/or 
protein binding will be retained for a maximum of 1 year following last pati ent visi t for the 
study .  The PK samples will be stored at a facilit y designated by  the sponsor.
10.4.3.1. Drug Concentrations for All Part C Patients and Part A a nd Part B 
Patients with P rogressive Disease and Planned Surgical Resection
Bloodand CSF samples will be collected for expl oratory  measurem ent of  abemaciclib and, if 
deem ed necessary , the concentrations of its metabolites. These samples will be collected at the 
time of surgery for pati ents participating in Part C .  In addit ion, resected brain tumor sam ples 
will be co llected for exploratory measurement of abemaciclib and, if deemed necessary, the 
concentrations of its metabo lites.  Separate samples are not required for the parent and its 
metabo lites.Supplies and i nstructi ons f or the collection and handling of blood, CSF,and tumor 
samples will be provided by the sponsor.   In cases where co llection of CSF is not feasible, a 
missing sample will not be consid ered a protocol  deviat ion.  
Plasma, CSF,and resected tumor samples will  be analyzed at a l aboratory  designated by  the 
sponsor.   Concentrations of abemaciclib and, if deem ed necessary, i ts metabo lites will  be 
explored using an LC/MS/MS method.  
In addit ion to the collect ion of blood, CSF, and tumor tissue fro m patients parti cipat ing in Part C, 
for pati ents in Part A and Part B with PD, if  surgical  resect ion of brain lesio ns is clinically 
indicated fo llowing disease progression, these patients may consent to provi de brain tumor tissue 
and cont inue on abemaciclib for up to 14 addit ional days fo llowing PD unt il the time o f 
scheduled surgery .  For these patients, plasma and CSF samples would also be collected at the 
time of surgery .
The rem aining tum or tissue and CSF samples after drug concentration measurements may  be 
used for addit ional analyses including, but not limited to, nucleic acid and protein profiles to 
better understand the disease process and to develop predict ive biomarkers.
10.5. Appropriateness of Mea surements
Efficacy measurements by radiographic imaging are standard, widely used, and generally  
recogni zed as reliable, accurate, and able to discriminate between effect ive and ineffect ive 
agents.
Safety measurements by laboratory  monitoring are standard, widely used, and generally 
recogni zed as reliable, accurate, and able to discriminate between agents with acceptable and 
unacceptable safet y profiles.

LY283521911.Data Quality  Assurance
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will do the fo llowing:
provi de instructi onal materi al to the study  sites, as appropriate
sponsor start -up training to instruct the invest igators and study  coordinators.  This sessio n 
will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of the eCRFs, and stud y procedures.
make periodic visit s to the study  site
be available for consultation and stay  in contact with the study  site personnel by  mail, 
telephone, and/or fax
review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer edits to detect errors in data 
collect ion
conduct a qualit y review of the database
In addit ion, Lilly or its representatives will periodically check a sample of the patient data 
recorded against source documents at the study  site.  The study  may be audi ted by  Lilly or its 
representatives, an d/or regul atory  agencies at any  time.  Invest igators will be given notice before 
an audit occurs.   
To ensure the safet y of parti cipants in the study , and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the invest igator will keep records of laboratory tes ts, clinical  notes, and pati ent m edical 
records in the patient files as original source documents for the study .  If requested, the 
investigator will provide Lilly , applicable regul atory  agencies, and applicable ERBs with direct 
access to original source docum ents.   
11.1. Data Capture S ystem
An electronic data capture sy stem  will be used in this trial.  The site maintains a separate source 
for the data entered by  the si te into the sponsor -provided electronic data capture system.
eCRF data will be encoded and sto red in a clinical  trial database.   Data managed by a central 
vendor, such as laboratory  test data, will be stored electronically in the central vendor’s database 
system .  Data will subsequent ly be transferred from the central vendor to Lilly.
Any data for which the paper documentation provided by the patient will serve as the source 
docum ent will be i dentified and documented by  each si te in that si te’s study  file.  Paper 
docum entati on provi ded by  the patient may include, for example, a paper diary  to collec t 
patient-reported outcome measures (for example, a rating scale), a daily dosing schedule, or an 
event di ary.
Data from co mplaint forms submitted to Lilly will be encoded and stored in the global product 
complaint m anagement sy stem .

LY283521912.Sample Size and Statis tical Methods
12.1. Determination of Sample Size
The primary  object ive of this clinical trial is to estimate the antitumor activit y, measured by 
OIRR of abemaciclib in patients with brain metastases secondary  to HR+ breast cancer.  
Two separate Simo n 2-stage de signs (Simo n 1989) will be emplo yed for this study; one will be 
used for PartA (patients with HR+ , HER2+ disease ) and another for Part B ( patients with HR+ , 
HER2- disease ). Each design assumes a 1-sided type-I error of 0.05 and 80% power.
For Part A, up to 56 qualified pat ients will be enrolled with the possibilit y of stopping the study  
early  for either lack of efficacy or unacceptable toxicit y. Twent y-three qualified patients will be 
enrolled in the first stage. If fewer than 2 of the first 23 patients respond to abemaciclib , accrual  
will be stopped ,and the conclusio n will  be drawn that abemaciclib is not worthy  of further study  
in the Part-A populat ion. If at least 2 of the first 23 patients respond to therapy , accrual  will 
continue until 33 additional qualified pat ients have been enrolled. A total of 6 responders out of 
56patients in PartA would need to be observed to warrant further invest igation of abemaciclib 
in this pat ient popul ation.  
The procedure described above tests the null hypothesis (H 0) that the true OIRR of abemaciclib 
in Part A i s ≤5% versus the alternat ive hypothesis (H a) that the true OIRR is 15%.  The 
probabilit y of early  terminat ion of the treatment arm under H 0is 0.68.   
Part B will have the identical design as PartA.
Assuming approximately 20% screening failure, the study  will enter approximately  150patients.
12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans
12.2.1. General Considerations
Statistical analysis o f this study  will be the responsibilit y ofLilly .  
Efficacy and safet yanalyses will be conducted on the full analysis set (FAS) .  Thi s set includes 
all data from all 
enrolled patients receiving at least 1dose of abemaciclib .  
PKanalyses will be conducted on all pat ients who have received at least 1 dose of abemaciclib
and have had samples collected.
Pharmacodynamic and/or tailoring bio marker analyses will be based on the subset of pat ients 
from the above popul ations from whom a valid assay  resul t (according to l aboratory  guideline) 
has been obtained.  
All tests will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05, unless otherwise stated.  All tests of 
interact ions will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0. 1, and all confidence intervals ( C Is)
will be given at a 2 -sided 95% level, unless otherwise stated .  
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 54
LY2835219Unless otherwise stated, a ll analys es will be conducted on each study  part separately. Pooled 
analys es including patientsfrom all 3partswill be conducted when a pplicable .  
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amen dment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  
Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the justificat ion for 
making the change, will be described in the clinical study  report.  
The assumpt ions for each statistical method will be evaluated.  If there is vio lation o f 
assumpt ions, alternat ive statist ical methods m ay be used.   
Addit ional exploratory  analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.   
12.2.2. Patient Disposition
A detailed description o f patient di sposi tion will be provi ded. All pat ient discont inuat ions will 
be docum ented, and the extent of each patient’s participation in the study  will be reported.  If 
known, a reason for discont inuat ion will be given.
A summary  of all important protocol deviat ions will be provided.   
12.2.3. Patient Characteristics
Patient dem ographics including age, sex, screening height and weight, andscreening body mass
index will be reported using descript ive statist ics.  
Baseline disease characterist ics will be su mmarized by  present ing frequency  counts and
percentages for pathological diagnosis (histological or cy tological), disease stage, or
perform ance status.   
Preexist ing condit ions, histori cal illness es, and prior chemotherapy  (incl uding both cy totoxi cand 
targeted agents) wil l be summarized
.  
Other patient characterist ics will be summarized as deemed appropriate .  
12.2.4. Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medicat ion will be summarized in a frequency table list ing the terms recorded on 
the eCRF.   
12.2.4.1. Postdiscontinuation Therapy 
The numbers and percentages of patients reporting postdiscont inuat ionanticancer therapi es will 
be provided overall, by  type of therapy  (surgery , radi otherapy , or systemic therapy ), and by  drug 
name.  
12.2.5. Treatment Compliance 
The number of dose omissio ns, reducti ons, del ays, cy cles received, and dose intensit y will be 
summarized for all treated pati ents.  
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 55
LY2835219Treatment compliance informat ion for abemaciclib will be co llected through pill counts at each 
visit.   The estimate of perc ent com pliance will be given by :
Percent Compliance =Actual  cumulative dose taken
Expected cumulative dose to be takenx 100
The actual  cum ulative dose taken will be determined based on counting the number of capsules 
returned at each visit and subtracting t hat number from the number of capsules dispensed.  The 
expected cumulat ive dose to be taken will be determined based on the assigned dose and will 
take into accoun t any  dose reducti ons or omissio ns.  
12.2.6. Primary Outcome and Methodology
The primary  endpoint of this study  is OIRR assessed using brain metastases response criteria
(see Attachm ent 5 ). The OIRR will be reported along with 95% CIsusing the normal 
approximat ion. 
12.2.7. Secondary Outcome and Methodology
The secondary  objectives for this study  are stated i n Section 6.2; secondary  efficacy  measures
aredefined in Sect ion10.1.4 .  
Point estimates and 95% 
CIs(using the normal approximation to the bino mial) will be calculated 
for BOIR, IDCR, ICBR, ORR , and DCR for PartA and PartB.  
Time -to-event efficacy endpo ints(OS, PFS, and DOIR ) will be summarized for Part A and 
PartB using Kaplan -Meier techniques (Kaplan and Meier 1958) if there is sufficient data. If 
perform ed, Kaplan -Meier curves will be generated, and quartiles and po int probabilit ies will be 
calculated. Interval estimates will be calculated using 95% CIs (Brookmeyer and Crowley 
1982).   
12.2.8. Pharmacokinetic and/or Pharmacodynamic Analyses
PKanalyses will be conducted on all pat ients who have received at least 1 dose of abemaciclib
and have had samples co llected ( seePharmacokinetic Sampling Schedule sinAttachment 7 and 
Attachm ent 8 ).  
Mean populat ion PK param eters for abemaciclib in plasma (clearance, exposure, volume of 
distribut ion, and half-lives) and interin dividual PK vari ability will be computed using nonlinear 
mixed effect modeling (NONMEM).  The current PK model for abemaciclib , which has been 
developed using plasma concentration data a vailable fro m the Phase 1 Study JPBA, will be 
updated using the plasma data collected in this study .  Covari ate effects (such as age, weight, 
sex, creatinine clearance, and plasma protein levels) on the PK parameters of abemaciclib in 
plasma will also be investigated.
Finally , pharmacodynamic data (such as neutrophil, lymphocy tes,or platel ets counts i n blood) 
collected in this study  may also be analyzed by means of NONMEM and connected to the 
popul ation PK model in a PK/ pharmacody namic model.  
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 56
LY2835219The version o f software used for the analysis will be documented and will meet the Lilly 
requi rements of so ftware validat ion.

will be provided for Study  Part A and Part B and/or response category  (CR/PR, SD, and PD); 
change from baseline and time to worsening will be explored . 
12.2.9.2. Neurolog ic Assessment in Neuro -Oncology Scale
Clinical response and progression will be explored and summarized for the NANO scale using 
descript ive statistics .  Neurologic response will be defined as an improvement of ≥2 on any 
single do main in the absence of deterioration in other domains.  Neurologic progression will be 
defined as worsening of ≥2 from baseline on any single domain.  These results may be compared
with objective tum or assessment results .  
12.2.9.3. Drug Concentrations in Samples from Surgical Patients
The relative concentrati onsof abemaciclib and its metabo lites in plasma, CSF, and tumor tissue 
collected at the time of surgical resect ion for pati ents part icipating in Part Cwill be explored .
Addit ionally , pati ents in Part A and Part B with PDand surgical resection clinically indicated 
may consent to provide samples for this exploratory analysis.   
12.2.9.4. Biomarker Analyses
The distribut ions of bio markers with c ontinuous measures, such as gene or protein expressio n, 
will be described.  Summary  statistics will include means, medians, corresponding standard 
errors, quartiles, and ranges.  Biomarkers with discrete measures, such as genoty pe locus, will  be 
summarized in frequency tables.  Correlative analyses may  be perform ed to invest igate 
associ ations between bio markers and clinical endpoints as deemed appropriate.
12.2.10. Health Outcome/Quality of Life Analyses 
Patients wi th at least 1 baseline and at least 1 postbaseline assessment will be included in 
the analyses. Com pliance wi th com pleting the questionnaires will be summarized at the 
group -level at each assessment period (defined as the number of completed 
questionnaires/number expected questionnaires given those that are still on study ).
Reason for missing quest ionnaires will be assessed .
Relationships amo ng MDASI -BT, Trail Making Tests, and other clinical parameters such 
as performance status , OS,and disease assessments may be explored.
Data will be summarized for each study  part (Parts AandB) and/orresponse categor y 
(CR/PR, SD, PD) ;change from baseline and t ime to worsening will be explored. This
summar ywill include m ean, standard devia tion, m edian, minimum , maximum , and 
change fr ombaseline .  The MDAS I-BT will be reported as core symptoms, brain tumor 
symptoms, symptom interference, and symptom groupings (affect, cogni tion,focal
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 57
LY2835219neurologic deficit, treatmen t-related symptoms, generalized/disease status symptoms, and 
gastrointest inalsymptoms). Time to worsening will be described for these categories.
Further analyses will be specified in the statis ticalanalysis plan.   
12.2.11. Safety Analyses
All safet y summaries and analyses will be based upon the FAS as defined in Sect ion 12.2.1 . 
Overall exposure to abemaciclib ,the numbers of patients complet ing each cycle ,and the dose 
intensity will be summarized using descriptive statist ics.  The number of patients with any dose 
adjustm ent will  be presented for enti re treatm ent peri od as well  as for each cy cle.  The number of 
patients wi th dose reducti ons, dose del ays, or dose omissio ns will also be summarized, as will 
the reasons for dose adjust ments. 
AEs will be reported using a unified CTCAE/MedDRA reporting process:
The CTCAE v4.0 term reported by  the invest
igator will be mapped to the MedDRA 
Preferred Term (PT) and SOC of the corresponding MedDRA Lower Level Term (LLT), 
unless the reported CTCAE term is ‘Other –specify’.
If the reported CTCAE term is ‘Other –specify’ the MedDRA LLT, PT, and SOC 
mapped fro m the verbat im AE term  will be used.
All listings and summaries will use the PT result ing fro m this process.
Preexist ing condit ions are defined as AEs that begin prior to the first dose of abemaciclib .A 
TEAE is defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severit y after baseline.
Com parisons of preexist ing condit ions to on -treatment events at the LLT level will be used in the 
treatm ent-emergent computation.   
An overall summary o f AEs will be provided for AEs deemed by the invest igator to be possibly 
related to abemaciclib and repeated for events regardless of abemaciclib causali ty.  
The fo llowing su mmar ies will be produced by  PT wi thin SOC:  preexist ing condit ions, SAEs, 
TEAEs, drug -related TEAEs, and procedure- related TEAEs.   
The fo llowing summaries will be produced by  PT wi thin SOC and maximum CTCAE grade:  
laboratory -based TEAEs, nonlaboratory -based TEAEs, drug -related laboratory-based TEAEs, 
and drug- related nonlaboratory -based TEAEs.   
Reasons for death will be summarized separate ly for on -therapy  and wi thin 30 days of treatm ent 
discontinuat ion. 
Hospitalizations and transfusio ns during the stud y treatm ent peri od or during the 30- day 
short -term follow-up peri od will be summarized by  treatm ent group.   
12.2.12. Interim Analyses
The Simo n 2-stage desi gn has a built -in int erim analysis to analyze OIRR and to meet threshold 
continuat ion criteria. The interim analysis o f OIRR for each study  part (Part A or Part B) will 
occur 6 m onths after the 23rd pati ent isenrolled in toeach respect ive part.  This is to ensure 
I3Y-MC-JPBO Clinical Protocol Page 58
LY2835219adequate durabilit y of response data is available at the time of analysis. This interim analysis for 
response must be strict ly followed to preserve the statist ical properties of the Simo n 2-stage
design. Due to this requirement, objective data will be obtained to document response and to 
determine if the trial is to continue bas ed on the OIRR. Because of this, no Assessment 
Committee or Data Monitoring Co mmittee will be convened to oversee this trial. 
Addit ional interim analyses will  be pl anned if deemed necessary .
12.2.13. Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses will be performed for poten tial prognosti c subgroup vari ables .

(Day -28 to Day -1) at baseline.  It is recommended that CT 
imaging of the abdomen and pelvis be performed with IV contrast, 
whenever possible.  For patients with known hypersensitivity to CT 
contrast material, a CT scan of the chest with out contrast and 
Gd-MRI of the abdomen/pelvis are encouraged.   Imaging based 
evaluation should be done rather than clinical examination unless 
the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
clinical exam.
Echocardiogram or

Adverse events collection/CTCAE grading XXAfter Visit 801, only study protocol or drug -related events are reported. If a patient has an 
ongoing AE or SAE possibly related to abemaciclib (for instance, abnormal electrolytes), the 
patient should be followed until the event is resolved, the event is no longer considered to be 
drug- related, the event becomes stable or returns to baseline, a ne w treatment is initiated for 
the patient, or the patient dies or is lost to follow -up.  Any subsequent follow -up(s) for AEs 
will be no more than 30 days ± 5 days in duration.

STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that is anticipated to enroll a 
total of approximately 400 patients. This number includes patients randomized under the initial protocol, and patients to be randomized 
under the amended, current, version of  this protocol (see below).  
Patients who previously managed their T2D with a single oral 
antidiabetic drug (OAD) may be eligible for screening if they have 
discontinued the OAD and been maintained on diet and exercise for 
at least 12 weeks before the Screening Visit. 
All patients will have a Screening Period comprised of an up to 
2 week Screening Phase and a 2-week, single-blind placebo Run-in Phase prior to randomization. In order to qualify for randomization, 
patients must demonstrate compliance during the single-blind placebo 
Run-in Phase based upon tablet count ( ≥80%).  
Randomization will be stratified by: 
• HbA1c at screening ( ≤8%, >8%) and 
• SBP at screening visit (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg).  
Following randomization, patients will have a 26-week, double-blind Treatment Period, and an on-site 4-week post-treatment Follow-up 
visit. 
All patients will have PPG assessed following a mixed meal tolerance 
text (MMTT) at Weeks 0 and 26. 
In the original version of this protocol, it was planned for a total of 
240 patients ≥18 years of age to be randomly assigned 1:1 to the 
following 2 treatment groups: 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg as two (2) 200-mg tablets, once daily 
• Placebo as two (2) placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin 
in appearance), once daily 
At the time of amendment to the current version of the protocol, 
approximately 100 patients had been randomized under this study 
design.  
In the amended, current, version of this protocol, approximately 
300 further patients ≥18 years of age will be randomly assigned 1:1:1

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 5 to the following 3 treatment groups: 
• Sotagliflozin 200 mg as one (1) 200 mg tablet and 
one (1) placebo tablet (identical to sotagliflozin in 
appearance), once daily 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg as two (2) 200 mg tablets, once daily 
• Placebo as two (2) placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin 
in appearance), once daily 
The enrollment will be completed when each of the 3 treatment groups (placebo, sotagliflozin 200 mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg) reaches approximately 100 randomized patients. 
Hemoglobin A1c, FPG, and PPG (from MMTT assessment) will be 
masked to study sites and patients after randomization and until study 
end. To prevent partial unblinding, UGE and urine GCR results will be 
masked to study sites and patients. Additionally, urinalysis by dipstick will not include the measurement of urine glucose. Urine glucose, 
albumin, calcium and creatinine will be measured separately at all on-
site visits by the central laboratory. 
Early termination 
If a patient discontinues treatment with investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) early during the 26-week  Treatment Period, the patient 
will have a Premature End-of-Treatment (EOT) Visit, and a Follow-up 
Visit 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP. In addition, every effort will 
be made to have all patients return to the site at the time 
corresponding to their scheduled visits , particularly the Week 26 Visit. 
If the patient does not agree to site visits, they will be contacted by 
telephone to inquire about their safety status, particularly at the time 
of the scheduled Week 26 Visit.  
The study design is presented graphically at the end of the synopsis.

STUDY TREATMENT(s)  
Investigational medicinal product  
 
  • Sotagliflozin 200 mg administered as one (1) 200 mg tablet 
and one (1) placebo tablet (identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg 
tablets in appearance), once daily, before the first meal of 
the day  
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg administered as two (2) 200 mg tablets, once daily, before the first meal of the day 
• Placebo administered as two (2 ) placebo tablets (identical 
to sotagliflozin 200 mg tablets in appearance), once daily, 
before the first meal of the day 
Noninvestigational medicinal Product     
 
     
 
     
 
    
 
     
 
     
 
     Rescue therapy 
The threshold values are defined as follows, depending on study 
period: 
• FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) from Randomization up through the scheduled Week 8 visit 
• FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) after the Week 8 visit up through the scheduled Week 12 visit 
• FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after the Week 12 visit through the end of the 26-week Treatment Period  
Routine fasting SMBG and central laboratory alerts on FPG are set up to ensure that glycemic parameter results remain under predefined 
thresholds. 
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the specific glycemic limit on one day, the patient checks it again during the two 
following days. If all the values in three consecutive days exceed the specific limit, the patient should contact the 
Investigator and a central laboratory FPG measurement be 
performed as soon as possible, preferably within 7 days, to confirm the hyperglycemia.  
• Upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue alert, a central 
laboratory re-test must be completed and confirmed as 
exceeding the threshold for rescue before rescue therapy is initiated. The re-test confirmation should be performed as 
soon as possible, but within 7 days of receipt, by 
unscheduled visit.  
In the event that a confirmatory FPG exceeds the threshold, the 
Investigator should ensure that no  reasonable explanation exists for 
insufficient glucose control and in particular that: 
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, 
no food intake for ≥8 hours) 
• Investigational medicinal pr oduct is given at the planned 
dose 
• There is no intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious disease) 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate 
• Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropriate

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 8  
 
 
  If any of the above can reasonably explain the insufficient glycemic 
control, the Investigator should consider not initiating rescue 
medication and should undertake appropriate action, ie: 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting condition (ie, after at least 
8 hours fast) 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in AE/concomitant medication parts of the 
e-CRF and the medical record) 
• Stress the absolute need to be compliant with treatment 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a 
Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional 
to reinforce the absolute need to be compliant with diet and 
lifestyle recommendations, and schedule a FPG assessment at the next visit. 
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease FPG under the threshold values, rescue medication may be introduced. 
Open label rescue medication(s) to treat hyperglycemia will be at the 
discretion of the investigator and in accordance with local standard of 
care and prescribing practice. Except for sodium-glucose 
cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibi tors, any approved medication(s) 
including oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin can be prescribed to treat 
the hyperglycemia. For patients with renal impairment, contraindications to antihyperglycemic drugs should be taken into consideration. If a patient requires glycemic rescue, the IMP received 
during the randomized, double-blind Treatment Period should 
continue and must remain blinded until the end of the study.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 10 calculations were based on the primary variable, change from 
baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c. Assuming a common standard 
deviation (SD) of 1.2% and using a 2-sided test at a 0.05 α -level, 120 
patients per arm would have 95% power to detect a treatment 
difference of 0.6% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 26 
between sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo. 
In the amended, current, version of this protocol, the sample 
size/power has been recalculated to account for the addition of the 
sotagliflozin 200 mg treatment group after enrollment had 
commenced. Assuming a common SD of 1.2% and using a 2-sided 
test at a 0.05 α-level, 100 patients per arm will have: 
• 94% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.6% in 
mean HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 26 between 
sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo, and  
• 84% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.5% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 26 between 
sotagliflozin 200 mg and placebo. 
As a result, the total number of patients will include:  
• Approximately 100 patients from the initial randomization 
(1:1) according to the orig inal protocol, balanced between 
placebo and sotagliflozin 400 mg, and 
• Approximately 300 patients from the subsequent 
randomization (1:1:1) according to the amended, current, 
protocol, balanced between placebo and the sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg doses.   
Analysis population: 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the intention to treat (ITT) 
population, defined as all randomiz ed patients irrespective of 
compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Patients will be analyzed for efficacy analyses according to the treatment group to 
which they are randomized, that is, sotagliflozin 400 mg versus 
placebo (those randomized to placebo), and sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo (those randomized to placebo in the amended 
randomization only). 
Primary analysis: 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to 
Week 26 in HbA1c) will be performed on the ITT population, using 
HbA1c measurements obtained during the study, including those obtained after IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change in HbA1c from baseline to 
Week 26 will be analyzed with missing values imputed by control-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at 
random frame work.  
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data, 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin 400 mg group, missing data will be imputed as if the patients were on placebo 
throughout the study, where all patients’ measurements 
including the on-treatment measurements will be 
considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 11 Each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by the Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment groups (sotagliflozin 
400 mg, placebo), randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.0%, >8.0%), 
randomization stratum of SBP (<130, ≥130 mmHg), and country as 
fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. Results from each complete dataset will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, 
as well as the between-group difference (comparing sotagliflozin 
400 mg vs placebo) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the 
difference.  
 
Summary statistics (for screening value, baseline value, observed 
values, and observed changes from Baseline) at scheduled visits will 
be provided for each treatment group. The summary will include the number of observations, mean, SD, standard error (SE), minimum, 
median, and maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to 
examine trends over time us ing mean values (±SE) and mean 
changes from baseline (±SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using observed cases [OC]).  
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a similar approach to 
the primary efficacy endpoint, with missing values imputed by control-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at 
random frame work.  
For each of the continuous secondary endpoints, each of the 
complete datasets will be analyzed by the ANCOVA model. To 
compare sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo, the model will include 
treatment groups (400 mg sotagliflozin, placebo), randomization 
stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.0%, >8.0%), randomization stratum of SBP 
(<130, ≥130 mmHg), and country as fixed effects, and baseline 
secondary endpoint value as a covariate. To compare sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo, the model will include treatment groups 
(sotagliflozin 200 mg, placebo), randomization stratum of HbA1c (≤8.0%, >8.0%), randomization stratum of SBP (<130, ≥130 mmHg), 
and country as fixed effects, and baseline secondary endpoint value 
as a covariate. Results from each complete dataset will be combined 
to provide the adjusted mean change from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, as well as the between-group difference 
(comparing each sotagliflozin group vs its corresponding placebo 
group) and the 95% CI for the difference. 
The categorical secondary efficacy variables of HbA1c <6.5%, <7% at 
Week 26 will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method stratified by randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.0%, >8.0%), and 
randomization stratum of SBP (<130, ≥130 mmHg). 
Analysis of other efficacy endpoints 
The analysis of other endpoints will be descriptive with no formal 
testing. Summary statistics at scheduled visits using OC will be 
provided by each treatment group. Graphical presentations will also be used to illustrate trends over time. 
Analyses of safety data 
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical significance

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 16 a If a patient discont inues treatment with IMP early during the Treatment Period, the patient will have a Premature EOT Visit, an d a Follow-up Visit 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP. However, every effort will be 
made to have all patients return to the site for all scheduled visits, in particular the Week 26 Visit. If the patient does not  agree to a site visit, they will be contacted by te lephone to inquire about safety status. If a 
patient discontinues  (or completes) treatment and study at the same time , a single visit will be perfo rmed using the procedure normally planned for the EOT visit. 
b Four weeks after the last dose of IMP. 
c Height to be measured only at screening 
d Vital sign measurements (sitting BP and heart rate): 3 separate seated BP and heart rate measurements should be taken with at l east 1 minute between readings, following a 5-minute rest period and prior to 
phlebotomy (see Section  9.2.1.4 and detailed instructions in Appendix D ).  
e See Section  9.2.1.6  for details of SMBG measurements. Glucose meters used for SMBG display results as plasma glucose concentration. Patients shoul d measure their fasting plasma glucose at least 3 times per 
week (including on day of each on-site study visit). 
f The 12-lead ECG recordings should be obtained prior to IMP admin istration. The ECG will be evaluated  as “normal” or “abnormal”.  
g Postprandial plasma glucose will be assessed by central laboratory at Baseline and 2 hours after consuming a standard mixed liquid breakfast meal and via a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) on Day 1 and 
Week 26. If a patient withdraws from IMP early, please see Section  10.3.4. 
h All laboratory assessments occur prior to first dose of double-blind IMP. The first dose of double-blind IMP occurs after sampl es for the mixed li quid meal have been collected. A ll visit dates w ill be scheduled based 
on the date of randomization with a ±3 days visit window allowed during the treatment period. Serum chemistry parameters (clini cal chemistry [including amylase and lipase], hematology, and other blood 
parameters) are listed in Table 2 . 
i Serum pregnancy testing only at screening; urine pregnancy testing subsequently. Serum pregnancy test results must be reviewed prior to beginning the Run-in Phase for all women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP). Any positive urine test results must be confirmed based  on serum pregnancy test. The Investigator may perform addition al tests at their discretion or as required by local regulations. For women of 
nonreproductive potential ( Appendix A ), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or  estradiol levels should be tested if the definition of postmenopausal or premenopa usal cannot be satisfied, eg, no medical 
document of hysterectomy or cessation of menses <12 months without an alternative medical cause. 
j Plasma concentration samples (ie, for sotagliflozin and sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide) on Weeks 4 and Week 18 should be drawn with the other laboratory assessments. For Week 26, plasma concentration 
samples should be drawn at predose and 2 hours 30 minutes, immediately after the respective glucose assessments during the MMTT . PK samples (except the 2 hours 30 minute sample during the MMTT) MUST 
be collected before administration of IMP. The date and time of the last intake of IMP prior to visits where PK samples are tak en should be recorded by the patient in the patient diary. Patients should be reminded 
of this at visits preceding PK time points to ensure these details are captured. In the case of Premature IMP discontinuation, PK samples should not be drawn at the Premature EOT visit, nor at any subsequent 
visits. 
k The markers of intestinal transit and absorption include vitamins B6, B12, K, E, and A, serum folate, and ferritin. 
l Markers of bone and calcium metabolism include:  serum and urinar y calcium, serum 25-hydroxyvita min D, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvita min D, serum and urinary phosphorus, serum parathyroid hormone, markers of 
bone resorption (serum NTX, serum β-CTX-1), and bone formation (serum P1NP). 
m Urinalysis includes urine dipstick and microscopy. Dipstick includes assessment of specific gravity, pH, protein, blood, ketone s, bilirubin, urobilinogen, nitrit e, and leukocyte esterase. Microscopy in cludes detection 
of formed cellular elements, casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and crystals in centrifuged urine sediment. In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspicious of urinary tract infection, urine culture should be performed. Positive urine culture determination will be based upon the criteria of the reporting laboratory. 
 
p All serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse ev ents (AEs), AEs of special interest (AESI s), and Events of Special Interest (EOSIs ) will be collected starting with signing in formed consent and continue until the end 
of the study. All AEs that occur during treatment should be followed until study completion (or until patients leave the study)  or until the event has resolved, the condition has stabilized, or the patient is lost to 
follow-up. All patients will have a follow-up contact 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP to collect safety information.

4.1 BACKGROUND:  SOTAGLIFLOZIN AND DISEASE 
Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of the sodium-glu cose cotransporters type 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and 2) 
being developed for use in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), a metabolic disorder characterized by 
hyperglycemia that results from a combination of increased insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. The microvascular complications of diabetes are well known and can result in 
impaired renal function, retinopath y and neuropathy. Other comorbidities that are frequently 
associated with diabetes are hy pertension, obesity, and cardiovascula r (CV) disease. Recently, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report stating that if current trends continue, 1 in 3 Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050. According to the most recent 
International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas,  the estimates in 2015 were that 1 in 11 adults 
have diabetes, which means 415 million people,  estimated to rise to 642 million by 2040 ( 2). 
In 2010, 33 million people in the European Union had diabetes, 9% of the adult population. This number is projected to increase to 38 million by 2030 ( 3). While these numbers include both 
people with T2D and type 1 diabetes (T1D), over 90%  of adults with diabetes have T2D. Diabetes 
is among the leading causes of death by disease and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and amputation (2,3). Despite the fact that the population of people with diabetes is growing, none of the current ther apies is curative and the results of treatment are 
variable. 
Although lifestyle changes, including diet, exer cise, and education, are valuable components of 
diabetes treatment, the vast majority of peopl e with T2D require pharmacological therapy to 
control the disease. In the United States and Europe, metformin is the standard first-line therapy in 
the absence of any contraindications or tolerability issues as per guidance from the American Association of Diabetes ( 4).  
Despite the numerous treatment options available, monotherapy fails in many patients as beta-cell 
function continues to deteriorate leading to progressively increasing hyperglycemia. Aggressive glycemic control with the currently available agents often leads to side effects, most notably weight gain and an increased frequency of hypo glycemia. These concerns emphasize the need to 
develop new agents that effectively and sa fely lower glucose in diabetic patients. 
In patients with diabetes, it is desirable to ma intain blood glucose in the normal range without 
exhausting the ability of the pancr eatic beta-cells to produce insuli n. Glucose is transported across 
the cell membrane by 2 different types of glucose transporters:  glucose-facilitated transporters and sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) proteins (5). In the kidney, after blood is filtered by the glomerulus, glucose passes into the urine, but 99% is reabsorbed, primarily via SGLT2, which is 
responsible for 90% of glucose reabsorption, while 10% is reabsorbed by SGLT1. When functional SGLT2 is lacking in humans, a signific ant amount of glucose remains in the urine and 
is removed from the body ( 6). This way of reducing blood glucose is not an insulin-dependent 
mechanism; therefore hyperglycemia may be reduced while the pancreas is spared from an

EFC14833 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 27 increased demand for insulin production that is caused by hyperglycemia. Since obesity is a 
significant comorbidity in T2D, and insulin resistance is increased in obesity, the caloric loss from glucose in the urine may represent an additional benefit resulting in decreased weight, which should result in decreased insulin resistance ( 6).  
The sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1 (S GLT1) is expressed predominantly in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract; SGLT1 is responsible for the majority of glucose absorption by the small intestine ( 7). Inhibition of SGLT1 in the GI tract prevents glucose from being absorbed. 
Additionally, there is accumulating evidence that SGLT1 inhibition stimulates secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), gut hormones invol ved in pancreatic 
beta-cell function and appetite control, respectively. Reduced glucose absorption in the proximal intestine leads to more glucose being delivered distally, which allows L cells in both the ileum and the colon to sense glucose and its byproducts, and as a result, they secrete GLP-1 and PYY. 
Although a complete lack of func tional SGLT1 may be associated with symptoms of glucose and 
galactose malabsorption, (8) pharmacologic inhibition of SGLT1 by sotagliflozin has not produced these effects in preclinical models or patients with T2D. Selective inhibitors of the 
SGLT1 transporter are in early stages of development. 
Extensive clinical studies conducte d for selective SGLT2 inhibitors have established this class as 
effective agents for the treatment of T2D (9,10,11 ) and have led to approvals by the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and the European  Medicines Agency (EMA). Studies with 
sotagliflozin, a potent dual inhibitor of SGLT2 and SGLT1, have shown that this agent produces 
significant glucosuria in preclinical animal m odels, healthy human volunteers, and patients with 
T2D. Single- and multiple-dose administration of sotagliflozin to healthy human patients has resulted in dose-dependent increases in glucosuria. Multiple-dose (28-day) administration in diabetic patients produced impr ovements in several metabolic parameters, including urinary 
glucose excretion (UGE), fasting plasma gluc ose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), GLP-1, and 
PYY. These data suggest that sotagliflozin should be  of therapeutic benefit to patients with T2D.  
4.2 CLINICAL TRIALS OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN IN HUMANS 
Approximately 780 subjects (639 assigned to so tagliflozin and 141 assigned to placebo) have 
participated in completed clinical studies of sotagliflozin. No significant safety concerns have been identified in the sotagliflozin drug program, and sotagliflozin has been well-tolerated in all studies to date. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) 
have been infrequent and have been balanced between treatment and comparator groups. Reports 
of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) across all sotagliflozin studies for which data are available were generally balanced  between treatment and comparator groups. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs ( ≥2.0%) were headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and dizziness, all of 
which were reported at a frequency greater than  placebo. However, most were described as mild 
to moderate, and most resolved spontaneously.  
In completed and ongoing clinical trials, no safety issues in addition to those already described in 
the current Investigator Brochure were observe d. In general, no significant imbalances of 
SAE/AEs between sotagliflozin and comparat ors were observed in  completed studies. 
Cumulatively, during the clinical trial program 8 SAEs were reported by 6 patients (4 T2D and

who received sotagliflozin included pulmonary em bolism, deep vein thrombosis, bile duct stone, 
cholangitis and lower limb fracture, while a myocardial infarction (MI) was experienced by a 
patient receiving placebo. Two SAEs of diabe tic ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported by 2 T1D 
patients receiving 400 mg once daily sotagliflozin in the Phase 2 T1D study LX4211.1 203-TIDM; both SAEs were assessed as due to failure of insulin delivery via insulin pump. 
A drug interaction study with digoxin, a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, indicated that 
sotagliflozin acts as a weak P-gp inhibitor. 
More information on the safety of sotagliflozin and on the clinical program can be found in the 
Investigator Brochure (IB). 
4.3 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY 
4.3.1 Rationale for selection of doses 
The selection of 400 mg and 200 mg once-daily doses is based on the results of the Phase 2b 
study LX4211.1-202-DM. In this study, doses of 75 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily, 200 mg twice daily, and 400 mg once daily sotagliflozi n were tested over a 12- week, double-blind period. 
The 400 mg and 200 mg once daily doses were chosen for further evaluation based on their HbA1c-lowering effects and the overall safety and tolerability observed at these doses. At 12 weeks, the 400 mg dose lowered HbA1c by a mean of 0.93% and the 200 mg dose by a mean 
of 0.48%, while placebo lowered HbA1c by a me an of 0.14%. Other doses did not have any 
advantages in efficacy, safety, or tolerability. The overall incidence of AE s in patients receiving 
400 mg or 200 mg once daily was similar to that seen with placebo. 
In healthy subjects sotagliflozin was well-tolerated following sing le doses up to 2000 mg, and in 
multiple doses up to 800 mg over 10 days. Furthermore, in a thorough QT study, single doses of 
sotagliflozin (800 mg and 2000 mg) were well tole rated and did not prolong the QT interval. 
Additionally, evaluation of metabolites in urine and plasma of healthy subjects resulted in no safety concerns following single doses of 400 mg sotagliflozin. Single doses of 400 mg in 
combination with sitagliptin, and multiple doses  up to 400 mg in combination with metformin 
over 12 weeks were also well tolerated in patients with T2D.  
4.3.2 Rationale for study design and control groups 
This study is designed to demonstrate the effica cy and safety of sotagliflozin when used as 
monotherapy in patients with T2D who have inadequate glycemic c ontrol with diet and exercise. 
Sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg will be compar ed to placebo, consistent with regulatory 
guidance. Based on the study design, the protocol stipulates that patients be provided antidiabetic 
agent rescue therapy according to a predefined algorithm. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of sota gliflozin are supported by Phase 1 and Phase 2 
studies and toxicology data in rats up to 26 weeks and dogs up to 39 weeks as well as 2-year 
carcinogenicity data in rats.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 29 To achieve balanced randomiza tion for assessment of the primary  endpoint, randomization will be 
stratified based on preexisting metabolic control (Screening HbA1c ≤8.0% versus >8.0%). 
Another stratification factor (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 130 < versus ≥130 mmHg) has been 
added to ensure balance in randomization for a secondary endpoint (change from baseline to 
12 weeks in SBP for patients with baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg). 
A placebo control will be used to allow for an unbi ased assessment of treatme nt effects and safety 
data. Bias will be minimized by randomizing the patients to treatment groups, blinding the 
patients, the Investigators, and the Sponsor to the treatment allocations, and by adjudicating the 
endpoints in a blinded fashion. 
A parallel-group, randomized placebo-c ontrolled design was selected be cause trial participants are 
exposed to a single treatment and assignment to that treatment is based solely on chance. This 
design is free of the limitations of competing designs such as crossover in which there may be a carryover of effect from one treatment to the second treatment. Although this carryover effect can be minimized with a washout period, it is possible that some longer term effects may persist. 
While the sample size of the pa rallel group design is larger to account for more variability when 
participants cannot serve as their own control,  the above-mentioned limitations of the crossover 
design have led the randomized controlled trial design to be the standard for therapeutic 
confirmatory trials for regulatory approval such as this trial. 
4.4 BENEFIT/RISK OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN 
Sotagliflozin is currently being investigated as  an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycemic control in adults with T2D. The study program will also provide efficacy and safety data for sotagliflozin in combination with other antidiabetic medications. In addition the study program will evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with high CV risk and in patients with renal impairment. The use of sotagliflozin in the treatment of T1D is also being studied in a separate development program. 
Sotagliflozin may benefit a wide variety of diabetic patients based on multiple potential beneficial 
effects of dual SGLT2/SGLT1 inhibition, and its insulin-independent mechanism of action. 
Improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and postprandial glucose (PPG) were obser ved with sotagliflozin 
in multiple studies. As anticipated from the mechanism of action, treatment  with sotagliflozin 
resulted in increased UGE (from inhibition of SGLT2)  as well as increased incretin levels (from 
inhibition of SGLT1). In addition, the improveme nts in body weight, blood pressure (BP), and 
triglycerides (TG) observed with sotagliflozin treatment have the potential to benefit patients with diabetes through their effects on common diabetic comorbidities.  
Overall, sotagliflozin has been well tolerated in all studies to date, with the majority of events 
assessed as mild to modera te; most of which resolved spontaneously. Serious adverse events and 
discontinuations due to AEs have been limited and balanced between treatment and comparator groups. Severe hypoglycemia, gen ital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, DKA, volume 
depletion with serious consequence (orthostasis, falls, fractures), severe diarrhea, pancreatitis, bone fractures, venous thrombotic events, drug-indu ced liver injuries (DILI), severe renal events

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter and multin ational, 1:1:1 randomiz ed, double-blind, placebo 
controlled, parallel group study th at is anticipated to enroll approximately 400 patients. This 
number includes approximately 100 patients enrolled under the original protocol study design, 
and approximately 300 patients to be enrolled under the amended, current, study design.  
The study will comprise a Screening period consisting of a Screening Phase and a single-blind 
placebo Run-in Period, a double-blind Trea tment Period, and a Follow-up period.  
The study design is presented gra phically at the end of the synopsis. 
6.1.1 Screening period 
6.1.1.1 Screening Phase (Visit 1) 
The Screening Phase will last up to 2 weeks. The period must be long enough to collect the data 
required to establish whether the patient sa tisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients with T2D currently managed with diet and exercise alone are eligible for enrollment in this study. Patients who previously managed their T2D with a single oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) 
may be eligible for Screening if they have di scontinued the OAD and been maintained on diet and 
exercise for at least 12 weeks before the screening visit.  
At the Screening Visit after signing of the informed consent form (ICF), eligibility criteria will be 
assessed and Screening assessment will be performed. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) not willing to use highly effective method(s) of birth control during the study treatment period and the follow-up period, or who are unwilling or  unable to be tested for pregnancy will be 
excluded from the study; guidance on highly eff ective contraceptive methods and collection of 
pregnancy information is provided in Appendix A . If another contraceptive method is used (such 
as a barrier method), it should be used in combination with one of the highly effective methods in Appendix A  (such as an oral contraceptive). 
The Interactive Response Technology (IRT; eith er Interactive Voice Response System or 
Interactive Web Response System) will be contacted  at Visit 1 for notification of screening and 
for patient number allocation. 
6.1.1.2 Run-in Phase (Visit 2) 
The Run-in Phase will last 2 weeks. Patients will be treated in a single-blind manner with placebo (2 tablets) once daily during the Run-in Period, starting from Visit 2.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 35 6.1.4 Follow-up period 
Following the last dose of IMP (either as sche duled or prematurely), a post treatment follow-up 
should be scheduled for all patients 4 weeks (±3 days) after permanent IMP discontinuation. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The duration of the study for each patient will include a Screening Phase of up to 2 weeks, a 
2-week Run-in Phase, and a 26- week double-blind treatment period. 
After completion of study treatme nt, each patient will enter a 4-week Follow-up Period. The total 
study duration for each patient will be up to 34 weeks. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The end of the study is defined as being the “las t patient last visit” pl anned with the protocol, 
including the follow-up visit. 
The Sponsor can terminate the trial prematurely based on the advice of the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) or other unforeseen developments. 
6.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
No interim analysis is planned. 
6.4 STUDY COMMITTEES 
6.4.1 Data monitoring committee 
A DMC with members who are independent from th e Sponsor and the Investigators will meet on 
a regular basis, and will be responsible for: 
Safety data to be reviewed will be unblinded and include even ts and outcomes described below 
for adjudication, as well as any additional safety da ta considered relevant. Details describing the 
DMC processes and procedures are outlined in a separate DMC Charter. To maintain continuous 
blinding and study integrity, the analysis will be conducted by an inde pendent statistician, and 
measures will be taken to ensure the validity of the data. 
6.4.2 Clinical endpoint committee(s) 
The Clinical Endpoint Committee(s)  (CEC) is/are comprised of experts in cardiology and 
nephrology (and other appropriate  medical specialties such as neurology and endocrinology, as 
needed) who are independent of the Sponsor and the contract research organization (CRO). The

(MACE)/selected CV events (MI, stroke, unstabl e angina leading to hospitalization, and heart 
failure leading to hospitalization), select ed renal events, bone fracture, and DKA. 
The details regarding the CEC processes and procedures will be outlined in the CEC Charter(s). 
6.4.3 Safety adjudication of events requiring ongoing monitoring  
Two independent committees will review safety events that require ongoing monitoring to ensure timing protocol amendments in case a safety signal is identified. These events are: 1) potential cases of DILI, and 2) cases of amputations. 
The two committees will review the cases in a treatment-blinded manner and will present their 
assessment to the DMC. 
The members, roles and responsibilities of the two committees will be de scribed in separate 
Charters. 
6.4.4 Steering Committee 
The Steering Committee (SC) is composed of experts in diabetes and scientists with clinical and 
methodological expertise. 
This Committee, led by a Chair, in collaborati on with the Sponsor, is responsible for producing 
and conducting a scientifically sound study and for ensuring accurate reporting of the study. In 
that capacity, the SC must address and resolve sc ientific issues encountered during the study. The 
members will remain blinded until completion of the study. 
Among its responsibilities, the SC will receive blinded study status reports from Sponsor, and will 
review the recommendations from the DMC th roughout the study. The SC members will 
participate in face-to-face meetings at regula r intervals throughout the study and in regularly 
scheduled teleconferences. 
Detailed activities and responsibilities of the SC are provided in the SC charter.

The threshold values are defined as  follows, depending on study period: 
Routine fasting SMBG (see Section  9.2.1.6) and central laboratory alerts on FPG are set up to 
ensure that glycemic parameter results remain under predefined thresholds.  
• To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg and 200 mg doses versus placebo with respect to change 
from Baseline for the following endpoints: 
• To compare sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo for:  
• To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg and 200 mg doses with placebo in the use of rescue 
medications for hyperglycemia  
• To assess plasma concentrations of sotagliflozin and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite in each sotagliflozin treatment group 
• HbA1c at Screening ( ≤8%, >8%) 
• SBP at Screening (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg)  
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg as two 200 mg tablets, once daily  
• Placebo as two placebo tablets (identical to  sotagliflozin in appearance), once daily 
• Review of accumulating clinical study safety data by treatment 
• Making a recommendation to the Sponsor regarding the study following each meeting 
• Run in kit containing 1 wallet of 34 placebo tablets for the Run-in phase 
• Treatment kit containing 2 wallets of 38 tablets each will be dispensed as needed for the duration of the treatment period: 
• FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) from Randomization up through the scheduled Week 8 visit 
• FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) after the Week 8 visit up through the scheduled Week 12 
visit 
• FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after the Week 12 visit through the end of the 26-week 
Treatment Period  
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the spec ific glycemic limit on one  day, the patient 
checks it again during the two following days. If all the values in three consecutive days 
exceed the specific limit, the patient should contact the Investigator and a central 
laboratory FPG measurement be performed as so on as possible, preferably within 7 days, 
to confirm the hyperglycemia.  
• Upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue al ert, a central laboratory re-test must be 
completed and confirmed as exceeding the threshold for rescue before rescue therapy is initiated. The re-test confirmati on should be performed as soon as possible, but within 
7 days of receipt, by unscheduled visit.  
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, no food intake for ≥8 hours)

• There is no intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious 
disease) 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate 
• Compliance to diet and lif estyle is appropriate 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting cond ition (ie, after at least 8 hours fast) 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in 
AE/concomitant medication parts of the e-CRF and the medical record) 
• Stress the absolute need to be compliant with treatment 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional to reinforce the absolute need to be compliant with diet and lifestyle 
recommendations, and schedule a FPG assessment at the next visit. 
In the event that a confirmatory FPG exceeds the threshold, the Investigator should ensure that no 
reasonable explanation exists for insufficien t glucose control and in particular that: 
If any of the above can reasonably explain the in sufficient glycemic control, the Investigator 
should consider not initiating re scue medication and should unde rtake appropriate action, ie: 
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be found, or if appropr iate action fails to decrease 
FPG under the threshold values, rescue medication may be introduced. 
Initiation of open-label rescue medication(s) to treat hyperglycemia will be at the discretion of the 
Investigator and in accordance with local standard of care and prescribing practice; except for SGLT2 inhibitors, any approved medication(s) includi ng oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin can be 
prescribed to treat the hyperglycemia. The patie nt continues the study treatment (blinded) and 
stays in the study in order to collect efficacy and safety information. The planned visits and assessments should occur until the last scheduled  visit. For patients with renal impairment, 
contraindications to antihyperglycemic drugs s hould be taken into consideration. If a patient 
requires glycemic rescue, the IMP received during the randomized, double-blind Treatment 
Period should continue and must remain  blinded until the end of the study. 
Rescue therapy is considered a noninvestigationa l medicinal product (NIMP) . Rescue therapy is 
to be reported in the e-CRF. This information should include specific drug  name, dose, route of 
administration, and frequency. 
If not covered by health insurance, the cost of the rescue therapy will be reimbursed by the 
Sponsor where permitted by local regulations.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 44 8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
To maintain blinding sotagliflozin and placebo tablets and packaging will be blinded and 
indistinguishable. 
During the double-blind Treatment Period each trea tment package will be labeled with a number, 
which is generated by a computer program from Sanofi. Investigators will not have access to the 
randomization (treatment) code excep t under circumstances described in  Section 8.3.2 . 
The randomization and the treatment allocation will be performed centrally by an IRT. The study biostatistician provides the randomization scheme to the IRT. Then, the IRT generates the patient randomization list from which it allocates treatment arms to the patients. 
Fasting glucose (plasma or serum), HbA1c, and PPG will be masked to study sites and patients 
after randomization and until study end. To prevent partial unblinding, UG E and GCR results will 
be masked to study sites and patients, and the central laboratory urine dipstick will not include the measurement of urine glucose. 
The CEC members will perform adjudication in a blinded manner. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an AE, the randomization code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient.  Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the IRT and/or by 
calling any other phone number provided by the S ponsor for that purpose. Code breaking can be 
performed by a local study Investigator, sponsor phy sician or healthcare professional with direct 
responsibility for patient care. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, 
time of day, and reason for code breaking. The identity of the unblinded personnel, how the code 
was broken, and the treatment kit number should also be recorde d. The Sponsor should also be 
informed. If the code is broken by the Investig ator (or other medical doctor in an emergency 
situation), the patient must be withdrawn from IMP administration.  
Randomization code breaking will also be performed during the analysis of the Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration samples. Only the Project manager and lead scientist at the Bioanalytical laboratory will have access to the randomization code to allow for th e sorting of the sotagliflozin 
plasma samples. The Bioanalytical lab and responsible pers onnel will follow the standard 
procedures to ensure the protection of the b lind within the Sponsor’s  clinical team. The 
randomization code or the individual analytical results will not be disclosed to any clinical team personnel prior to th e database lock. 
Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected serious adve rse drug reaction unblinding by the 
Sponsor.

8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
Investigators or other authorized persons (eg, phar macists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a 
secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specif ications, policies, and 
procedures. 
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature and instructions for handling 
the Sanofi compound should be managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor. 
The expiry date and storage conditions are writte n on the IMP labels. The IMP should be stored 
between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F) 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labelin g, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor or Delegate. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor or Delega te, in order to recall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for direct-to-patient shipment, for which a courier company has been approved by the Sponsor), allow the IMP to be used other than as directed by this  clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any 
other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Accounting and compliance for IMPs will be performed at Visit 3 and all subsequent visits.  
The Investigator will check the compliance to the study treatments based on the patient diary and 
will then complete the appropriate Site treatment and patient treatment log forms. Returned IMP should be counted by site staff. In addition the dosing information will be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF.

trained again and mentored. If suboptimal compliance continues after training and mentoring, 
patients may be discontinued at the discretion of  the PI after discussion with the Sponsor’s 
medical monitor.  
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
Patients are to return all IMP (unused, in-use or used wallet[ s]) at each on-site visit (see 
Section  1.2).  
At Visit 4 (Week 1), because no IMP re-supply is pl anned during this visit,  patients will be sent 
home after this visit with the in-use wallet(s) dispensed at randomization. 
Patients are to return all the used, in-use and unused IMP at Visit 9 (or final assessment 
on-treatment visit in case of permanent premature discontinuation).  
All used, partially-used or unused IMPs will be retrieved by the Sponsor or Dele gate. A detailed 
site and patient treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by the I nvestigator and the monitoring team. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to any IMP(s). The IMP includes placebo, sotagliflozin 400 mg and sotagliflozin 200 mg. 
All concomitant medi cations should be documented on the Me dications page of the e-CRF. This 
includes all non–IMP treatments that are taken by  the patients at any time during the clinical 
study, beginning at Visit 1. Additionally, all medications ta ken in the 3 months prior to Visit 1 and prior use of SGLT2 
inhibitors should be reported.  
8.8.1 Prohibited prior and concomitant medications 
During the study treatment period, the following medications are prohibited: 
• Initiation of any antidiabetic agents, including oral or injectable antihyperglycemic agents 
other than the IMP is not allowed before the rescue therapy 
• Systemic use of glucocorticoids is not allowed for more than 10 consecutive days (topical, ophthalmic, nasal spray or inhale d applications are allowed) 
• Initiation of any weight loss drugs (eg, phentermine, orlistat)  
• Investigational medici nal products in any other clinical study 
• SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapagliflo zin, or empagliflozin) are not allowed for 
rescue

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 48 Note : short term use (< 10 consecutive days) of th e prohibited medication, eg, short-acting insulin 
for treatment of acute illness or surgery is allowed.  
Reduction of digoxin dose should be considered because sotagliflozin acts as a weak P-gp 
inhibitor and increases systemic exposure to digoxin. Patients taking sotagliflozin with 
concomitant digoxin should have digoxin concentrations monitore d and doses reduced as needed. 
In addition, other P-gp substrates may be affected and the labels of P-gp substrate drugs should be 
consulted with regards to monitoring and dose adjustments. 
Other medications which are unlikely to interfer e with the PK or PD of the IMP or confound 
interpretation of the study endpoints are allowed as needed and following discussion between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor. However, doses of chronically administe red medicines should be 
kept fixed during the trial if at all possible. After premature permanent discontinuation of the IMPs, any treatments (other than SGLT2 
inhibitors) are permitted, as deemed necessary by the Investigator. The dose of all antihypertensive agents should be kept constant during the 12 weeks following 
randomization and no antihypertensive agents s hould be added or withdrawn for the 12 weeks 
following randomization unless it is consid ered necessary for safety reasons. 
8.8.2 Concomitant diabetes therapy 
Non-IMP treatment is defined as the rescue medication(s) that will be used to treat hyperglycemia when a patient’s hyperglycemia reaches the resc ue threshold. Except for SGLT2 inhibitors, any 
approved medication(s) including oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin can be prescribed at the Investigator’s discretion to treat the hyperglycemia. The regimen of the rescue medications will be in accordance with local standard of care and prescribing practice. 
8.9 POSTSTUDY TREATMENT 
Because sotagliflozin may reduce BP, adjustment of antihypertensive medication may be needed during the study in patients with hypertension. Co nversely, monitoring for an increase in BP 
should be performed after withdrawal of study medi cation. If the BP is elevated after withdrawal 
of study treatment, the Investigator should c onsider adding or adjusting antihypertensive 
medication.

9.1.4 Assessment methods of efficacy endpoints 
9.1.4.1 HbA1c 
Hemoglobin A1c will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3), and all on-site visits 
during the double-blind treatment period with the exception of Week 1 (Visit 4). 
For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of the study, HbA1c is measured by a certified level I 
“National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program” central laboratory to allow estimation of the change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c and the proportion of patients with HbA1c <6.5%, <7.0% at Week 26. 
If a patient needs to receive rescue antidia betic medication, assessment of HbA1c should be 
performed before the introduction of the rescue medication. 
9.1.4.2 Postprandial glucose and mixed meal tolerance test 
Patients will undergo assessment of PPG at Visit 3 (Baseline) and Visit 9 (Week 26) via a mixed 
meal tolerance test (MMTT) to allow estimation of change from Baseline to Week 26 in 2-hour 
PPG following a MM. Full details of the MM TT procedure at Baseline and Week 26 are 
presented in Appendix B . 
At Visit 3 (Baseline) and Visit 9 (Week 26), PPG values will be assessed by MMTT at baseline (fasting) and 2 hours after consuming a standard mixed liquid breakfast meal. 
The first dose of double-blind IMP on Day 1 (Baseline; Visit 3) will be given after  completion of 
the 2-hour PPG collection. For the Week 26 standard ized MM, the patient should take the dose of

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 51 double-blind IMP immediately after  the fasting blood samples are obtained, and approximately 
30 minutes before  ingestion of the standardized MM begins. 
Plasma concentration samples at Week 26 should be taken at the same times as the fasting blood 
sample and the 2-hour central labor atory plasma PPG collection (see Section  9.3.1.1). 
The composition and the quantity of the standard mixed liquid breakfast meal must be identical 
throughout the study; see Appendix B  for further details.  
All patients should undergo the standardized MMTT at Visit 9 (Week 26), including those 
rescued before Visit 9. 
In case of permanent discontinuation of the trea tment with IMP before Visit 9 (Week 26), every 
effort will be made to have the patient return to the site at the time of their Visit 9 (Week 26); 
however the MMTT should not be performed at this or any other visit following a Premature EOT visit. 
On the days of the MMTT, patients will come to the investigational site in the morning, in fasting 
conditions for at least 8 hours and must not eat  any food or drink, except water, before the 
scheduled standardized meal test.  
The exact times of the IMP administration, standard  mixed liquid breakfast meal intake, and the 
blood draws are to be documented. 
9.1.4.3 Fasting plasma glucose measurement 
Plasma glucose is measured in the fasting state at Screening (Visit 1) and all on-site visits during 
the treatment period. For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of th e study, FPG is measured at 
a central laboratory to allow estimation of change from Baseline to Week 26 in FPG. 
9.1.4.4 Body weight measurement 
Body weight is measured at all on-site visits to allow the estimation of change from Baseline to Week 26 in body weight and reduction in body weight by ≥2%, ≥ 5%, and ≥10% from Baseline. 
Body weight should be obtained with the patient  wearing undergarments or very light clothing 
and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The sa me scale should be used throughout the study, 
and calibrated on a regular basis as  recommended by the manufacturer. 
The same scale should be used throughout the study, and calibrated on a regular basis as 
recommended by the manufacturer. Calibration s hould be documented in source documents. The 
use of balance scales is recommended. The floor su rface on which the scale rests must be hard and 
should not be carpeted or covered with other soft material. The sc ale should be balanced with both 
weights at zero and the balance bar aligned. The pa tient should stand in the center of the platform

Systolic BP and DBP will be asse ssed at all on-site visits. Blood pr essure measurements must be 
taken as described in Section  9.2.1.4 with details provided in Appendix D.  
9.1.4.6 Kidney function parameter measurement 
Urine albumin, creatinine and glucose, and serum creatinine are assessed at Baseline (Visit 3) and 
all subsequent on-site visits. A central laboratory will analyze samples and estimate change from 
Baseline in urine ACR, UGE, urine GCR, serum creatinine and eGFR (by the 4 variable MDRD equation). To prevent partial unblinding, UGE and GCR results will be masked to investigational sites. 
9.1.4.7 Proportion of patients requiring rescue for hyperglycemia 
The use of rescue medications for hyperglycemia  will be assessed and re ported throughout the 
treatment period. Routine alerts on FPG will be sent to the Investigator from the central laboratory 
to ensure that glycemic parameter results remain within predefined thresholds. For details and further actions should FPG values fall above thresholds, refer to Section  8.2.1. 
9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
Assessments for safety include AEs, SMBG, clinical laboratory assessments, physical 
examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), weight, an d vital signs. An independent DMC will meet 
on a regular basis to review accumulating clinical trial safety data. 
Adjudication of all deaths, MACE/other selected CV  events (MI, stroke, unstable angina leading 
to hospitalization, and heart failu re leading to hospitalization) , selected renal events, bone 
fracture, and DKA will be performed in a blinded manner by a CEC(s) comprised of experts. 
Details will be provided in the charter of th e CEC(s). Further details are available in Section  6.4.2. 
Two expert committees will review all potential cases of DILIs and cases of amputation in a treatment-blinded manner to evaluate causality. 
The following safety endpoints will be assessed: 
• Adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation from the IMP, adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs), Events of Special Interest (EOSIs), SAEs and deaths 
• Hypoglycemia (all, severe, and/or documented symptomatic hypoglycemia) 
• Clinical laboratory results (including fasting lipids; see Section  9.2.1.3), vital signs and 
ECG results 
• Markers of bone and calcium metabolism  
• Markers of intestinal transit and absorption

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 53 Observation period of safety endpoints  
The observation period of safety data will be divided into 3 segments: 
• The pre-treatment period is defined as the time between the date of the informed consent 
and the first dose of double-blind IMP.  
• The on-treatment period (TEAE period) is defined as the time from the first dose of double-blind IMP up to 10 days (1 day for hypoglycemia) after the last dose of 
double-blind IMP, regardless of the introduction of  rescue therapy. The 10-day interval is 
chosen based on the half-life of the IMP (approximately 5 times the half-life of sotagliflozin) in patients with moderate  renal dysfunction.  
• The post-treatment period is defined as the time starting 11 days after the last dose of 
double-blind IMP (after the on-treatment period).  
The baseline value for safety endpoints in the safe ty population is the last available value (or the 
average of all values for creatinine or eGFR) prior to the first administration of the double-blind 
IMP. 
9.2.1 Assessment methods of safety endpoints 
9.2.1.1 Adverse events 
Adverse events including SAE, AESI and EOSI will be assessed. Refer to Section  10.4 to 
Section  10.6 for details. 
9.2.1.1.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse Events of Special Interest are listed in Section  10.4.1.3, reporting requirements for AESI 
are presented in Section  10.4.4. 
9.2.1.1.2 Events of Special Interest 
Events of Special Interest are separate from AESIs. For a list of events defined as EOSIs and their 
reporting requirements see Section  10.4.1.4 and Section  10.4.5, respectively. 
9.2.1.2 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia will be assessed from Visit 2 onwards and continue until 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP (note: for patients who discontinue treatment before Week 26, safety data will be collected until scheduled study end). Patients will also complete the hypoglycemia log (as part of the patient diary) from Visit 2 onwards, which will be regularly reviewed by Investigators. See Section  10.6.1 for further details.

The clinical laboratory data consist of blood analysis (including hematology , clinical chemistry, 
amylase, lipase, lipid profile) and urinalysis, according to the schedule presented in Section  1.2. 
Clinical laboratory values will be analyzed after conversion into standard international units. 
International units will be used in all listings and tables. Table 2 lists the hematology, clinical 
chemistry and other blood safe ty parameters to be assesse d by the central laboratory. 
Alerts to the Investigator are set up for speci fic laboratory abnormalitie s. Investigators should 
review these alerts and follow-up if needed as per his/her medical judgement. Re-tests at central laboratory are acceptable if needed.  
In addition, for WOCBP a serum pregnancy test is  performed at Screening and urine pregnancy 
tests are taken at all on-site visits during the double-blind Treatment Period excluding Visit 4 
(Week 1). Any positive urine test results must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. The 
Investigator may perform additional tests at thei r discretion or as required by local regulations. 
For women of nonreproductive potential ( Appendix A ), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 
and/or estradiol levels should be tested if the definition of postmenopausal or premenopausal 
cannot be satisfied, eg, no medical document of hysterectomy or cessation of menses <12 months 
without an alternative medical cause.

9.2.1.3.1 Urinalysis 
Urinalysis (urine dipstick with microscopy) by central laboratory will be performed at Screening 
(Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3) and Week 26 (Visit 9). To prevent partial unblinding, UGE results 
will be blinded to investigational sites and patients, and the central laboratory urine dipstick will not include the measurement of urine gl ucose. Central urinalysis includes: 
• Urine dipstick includes: specific gravit y, pH, protein, blood, ketones, bilirubin, 
urobilinogen, nitrite, a nd leukocyte esterase 
• Urine microscopy includes, but is not limited to: detection of formed cellular elements, 
casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and cr ystals in centrifuged urine sediment 
In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspicious of urinary tract infection, urine culture 
should be performed. Positive urine culture determination will be based upon the criteria of the reporting laboratory. 
If the urine dipstick is positive for blood, the central laboratory will perform reflexive testing to 
include microscopy. Additional testing will be performed according to the judgment of the Investigator. Referral to urology/urologic ev aluation is recommended for new or unexplained 
cases of confirmed hematuria (urology/urologic evaluation is not required where hematuria is 
considered to be related to diabetic nephropathy). 
In addition, urine albumin, calcium, glucose and creatinine will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 3) and all subsequent on-site visits. 
Urine markers of bone and calcium metabolism will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 3), and 
Week 26 (Visit 9), and include: calcium and phos phorus. Serum markers of bone and calcium

A complete physical exam (including sitting blood pressure and heart rate, temperature and 
respiratory rate) will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 9 (Week 26); abbreviated physical exams (including sitting blood pressure and heart rate) will be performed at all other on-site visits. The abbreviated physical exam should focus on cardiac and respiratory systems, as well as any areas important for assessment of AEs if necessary. Three separate seated BP and heart rate measurements should be taken with at least 1 minute between measurements following a 5-minute rest period, and prior to phlebotomy. Fu ll details and directions for the measurement of 
blood pressure are presented in Appendix D .  
9.2.1.5 Electrocardiogram variables 
The ECG assessment of “normal” or “abnormal” will be analyzed. 
A 12-lead ECG record is performed locally at Sc reening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3) and Week 26 
(Visit 9).  
The 12-lead ECG should be performed  after at least 10 minutes in supine position and prior to the 
morning IMP administration. The Investigator should review the ECG and document the interpretation, sign and date it on the ECG print out and report it in the e-CRF. Each ECG trace is 
analyzed in comparison with the screening recorded  trace. All original traces are kept as source 
data. 
Note: Any new ECG abnormality should be r echecked for confirmation and reported as 
appropriate for that finding.
 
9.2.1.6 Self-monitoring of blood glucose 
A meter for self-assessment of blood glucose will be  dispensed at the Run-in visit (Visit 2). In 
addition to home measurements of self-monitored blood glucose, self-monitoring of blood glucose 
will be performed at Run-in (Visit 2) and all subsequent on-site visits. Glucose meters used for SMBG display results as plasma glucose concentration. 
Patients will also receive a patient diary at all on-site visits from Visit 1 to Visit 9. The diary will 
be reviewed at all on-site visits from Visit 2 to  Visit 10. Self-assessed blood  glucose levels will be 
entered in the patient diary. Patients will be asked to self-assess blood glucose le vels at least 3 times a week from the run-in 
Visit (Visit 2) to Week 26. Patients will be re quested to self-assess blood gl ucose levels in the fasted state and whenever they 
experience any illnesses (eg, cold, flu), or symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. 
Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include shakiness,  dizziness, sweating, hunger, headache, pale 
skin color, sudden moodiness or be havior changes (such as crying for no apparent reason), clumsy 
or jerky movements, seizure, difficulty paying attention or confusion, or tingling sensations

Patients will be provide d with instructions on how to recognize the symptoms of DKA and 
instructed to contact the site (o r seek emergency medical services if after business hours) if these 
symptoms develop. Patients should have a full clinical evaluation with laboratory testing for 
possible DKA by the Investigator or emergency me dical services physician. If such evaluation 
and laboratory testing confirm the presence of metabolic acidosis, then appropriate treatment 
should be implemented and the “Possibl e DKA” e-CRF should be completed. See  Appendix C  for 
further details. 
9.3 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics 
The PK endpoint is: 
• Plasma concentrations of sotagliflozin and its metabolite pre-dose at Weeks 4, 18 and 
26 and 2 hours 30 minutes post-dose at Week 26 
9.3.1.1 Sampling time 
At Weeks 4 and 18 (Visits 5 and 8, respectively), blood samples for PK assessment are to be drawn with the other laboratory assessments. At Week 26, PK samples should be drawn at pre-dose and at 2 hours 30 minutes postdose,  immediately after the respective glucose 
assessments during the MMTT. Pharmacokinetic  samples (with the exception of the 2 hours 
30 minute sample during the Week 26 MMTT) must  be collected before administration of IMP.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 60 Improvements in FPG and PPG have been observed with sotagliflozin in multiple studies. 
Therefore assessment of both fastin g and post-prandial glucose (after  a MM) is relevant in this 
study. These 2 parameters are also considered by regulatory agencies to be supportive of efficacy of an antidiabetic agent. 
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin ma y reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with 
SBP ≥130 mmHg at baseline, while having no si gnificant effect in patients with SBP 
<130 mmHg, and did not induce hypotension. Since this  could be of benefit to patients with T2D, 
this finding is being followed up as a secondary obj ective in this trial, as well as the potential in 
patients with DBP >80 mmHg. Although effects on BP in Phase 2 data were observed with the 
400 mg dose at 12 weeks, the effects will be examined at Weeks 12 and 26. 
Endpoints for evaluating renal function include eGFR, based on serum creatinine, and urine 
albumin to creatinine ratio as well as routine m onitoring of urine via dipstick and microscopy. 
UGE and urine GCR are other valid markers of re nal function, and will be assessed at appropriate 
time points in this study.
 
Due to potential effects on bone and calcium metabolism, specific biomarkers for bone and 
calcium metabolism will be assessed at regular time points. In view of the SGLT1 inhibitory 
effects in the GI tract, specific markers of intestinal transit and absorption will also be measured. 
The other efficacy and safety assessments in  this study are standard, well-established 
measurements for a Phase 3 study evaluating the treatment of T2D in adult participants.  The length of the study is cons idered appropriate for detection of the primary endpoint given the 
power estimates (see Section  11).

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The visit schedule and procedures/assessments are listed in the “Study Flow Chart” ( Section  1.2). 
The aim of this section is to provide details on how so me of the procedures/assessments should be 
performed. 
This is an out-patient study and consists of 10 on-site visits, although optional on-site and/or 
telephone visits can be scheduled at any time  for any reason during the study whenever 
considered necessary by the Investigator. The patients need to be fasting for on-site visits V1 through V9 (Week -4 through Week 26), 
unless instructed otherwise by th e Investigator. Throughout the study, “fasting” is defined as 
8 hours without food. Note: If the patient is not fasting at the visits specified above, the blood 
sample will not be collected a nd a new appointment should be given to the patient for the 
following day if possible, with instruction to be fasted.   
The Run-in visit can be performed as soon as the re sults of all screening te sts are available and the 
patient is confirmed to be  eligible for participation in the st udy. The visit window for visits V4 
through V10 should occur within ±3 days. If one visit date is changed, the next visit should occur 
according to the original schedule, ie calculated from the date of Baseline visit (Visit 3, Week 0). 
For a complete list of procedures scheduled for each study visit please refer to the Study Flow 
Chart ( Section  1.2), which details the procedures to be performed.  
All data obtained during the trial visits will be reviewed by the Investigator and sub-investigators 
who are qualified in treatment of T2D and are trained on the study. 
10.1.1 Screening Period 
The Screening period is up to 4 weeks and includes the Screening Phase and the Run-in Phase. 
10.1.1.1 Screening Phase 
The duration of the Screening Phase is up to 2 weeks and includes only the Screening Visit 1 (Week -4). The period must be long enough to co llect the data to establish whether the patient 
satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients will undergo screening assessments at Vi sit 1 (Week -4) following signing of the ICF. 
Patients who meet the inclusion criteria as noted in Section  7.1 and have no exclusion criteria as 
noted in Section  7.2 will be randomized at Visit 3 (Day 1).

For screen failure patients, the following source data must be verified: patient's identification 
details, the informed consent signed by the patient, the study identification (name), dates of study visits and the main reasons for screen failure. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the stud y and followed for the remainder of the study duration to collect 
vital safety status  and endpoint data. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator because of suspected AEs. Lower extremity complications (such as sk in ulcers, infection, osteomyelitis, and gangrene) 
requiring treatment should lead to temporary di scontinuation of IMP. Re initiating trea tment with 
the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring once the 
Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikel y to be related to the IMP. 
It is in the interest of the patient to monitor blood glucose during the temporary discontinuation period, therefore regular determination of SMBG is to be  performed and documented. 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the e-CRF  when considered as confirmed. 
Temporary treatment discontinuation decided by the Investigator corresponds to more than 1 dose 
not administered to the patient. 
Use of any different anti-hyperglycemic medication during the time of temporary treatment 
discontinuation (ie, insulin during a hospitalization) is recorded as concomitant medication with the name and doses recorded in the e-CRF. 
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at any time.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 71 10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP at any time for any reason or this may be 
the Investigator’s decision. Patients should discuss stopping study medication with the site before 
doing so in order that questions can be addre ssed, glycemic therapy adjusted, and a follow-up 
assessment arranged. All effort s should be made to document the reasons for treatment 
discontinuation and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
The following reasons lead to permanent discontinuation: 
• At the patient’s own request (ie, w ithdrawal of consent for treatment) 
• If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation with the administration of the study treatment would be detrimental to the patient's well-being 
• Inter-current condition that requires permanen t discontinuation of th e study treatment as 
long as the abnormality persists and if the casual relationship of the concerned event and 
the IMP is possible (according to the In vestigator’s best medical judgment) 
• Pregnancy (in female patients) 
• Specific request of the Sponsor 
Any abnormal laboratory value will be rechecked immediately for confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of  the IMP for the concerned patient. 
For patients who prematurely discontinue the IMP, the assessments planned at EOT visit 
(Section  10.1.2.1.2) will be performed at the Premature EOT Visit, scheduled preferably prior to 
treatment discontinuation or as s oon as possible after time of discontinuation the latest at the next 
on-site visit). Reason for IMP discontinuation will be clearly specified. This Premature EOT assessment may occur at a regularly schedul ed visit or at an unscheduled visit. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Every effort should be made to maintain patient s in the study. Patients should be followed up 
according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed-up as specified in this 
protocol, whichever comes last. 
If a patient prematurely discontinues st udy treatment, a Premature EOT visit (see 
Section  10.1.2.1.2) should be scheduled prior to treatment  discontinuation, if possible. If not 
possible, the Premature EOT should be sche duled as soon as possible after treatment 
discontinuation. In the case of early disc ontinuation, no sample for measuring plasma 
concentration should be taken at the Premature EOT visit, nor at any subsequent visits. For 
patients who discontinue tr eatment but remain in the study, th e remaining visits should occur as 
scheduled where possible. The IRT should be notified of EOT.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceu tical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
Medical and scientific judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to  be considered a medically important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse 
- ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN 
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality

10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such even ts may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added, modified or 
removed during a study by protocol amendment. 
The AESIs for this study: 
• Pregnancy of a female patient entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a 
female partner of a male patient entered in a study with IMP/NIMP.  
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient included in the clinical trial or in a female 
partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  10.4.1.2), 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female  patient, IMP should be discontinued,  
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female patient or in a female partner of a male patient 
is mandatory until the outcome has been determined (see Appendix A ). 
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) with IMP/NIMP 
- A symptomatic overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event 
suspected by the Investigator or spontaneous ly notified by the patient and resulting in 
clinical symptoms and/or signs accompanied by administration of more than twice the intended daily dose within a 24-hour period. It  will be recorded in the e-CRF as an 
AESI with immediate notification “Symptomatic OVERDOSE (accidental or intentional)” in all cases and will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria. 
(Please note that an Asymptomatic over dose with the IMP/NIMP, accidental or 
intentional, defined as administration of more than twice the intended daily dose 
within a 24-hour period, without clinical symptoms and/or signs, either suspected by the Investigator or spontaneously notifie d by the patient, not based on accountability 
assessment. It will be recorded as an AE “Asymptomatic OVERDOSE, accidental or intentional.”)

An EOSI is a serious or non-serious AE of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring may be appropriate. Such events 
may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. These events 
should be reported on the specific e-CRF page (where applicable) and will only qualify for 
expedited reporting when serious (fulfilling SAE criteria). 
The EOSIs for this study are: 
• Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE [cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, 
or stroke]) and other specific CV events (e g, heart failure leading to hospitalization) 
• Severe hypoglycemia (see Section  10.6.1) 
• Genital mycotic infections (t o include vulvovaginal candidias is in females and candidal 
balanitis in males) 
• Urinary tract infections 
• Clinically relevant volume de pletion and events related/possibly related to volume

• Venous thrombotic events, to include deep venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (to 
include pulmonary embolism) 
• Diabetic ketoacidosis 
• Renal events, to include 50% decline in eG FR, end stage kidney disease, renal death 
• Malignancies of special interest (breast, bladder, renal cell, Leydig cell, pancreatic, 
prostate, and thyroid cancer) 
• Adverse event leading to an amputation 
10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the ICF until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, 
are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the e-CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, 
and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s).

make it difficult to assess the causal relati onship, particularly for hypoglycemia. Global 
Safety Officer with input from other appropr iate study team memb ers will determine the 
causal relationship when it is not clearly provided by the Investigator. 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by the monito ring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or EC G abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs if they are 
medically relevant based on the inves tigator’s medical judgment, eg,:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI or EOSI 
10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator or any designees must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send the notification to the Monitoring team and 
Pharmacovigilance after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations  were performed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure  that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's 
identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded  in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to further document any SAE that is fatal or life-threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
• A back-up plan (using a paper CRF process) is available and should be used when the 
e-CRF system does not work.

10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypoglycemia 
During the study, patients are instructed to do cument any hypoglycemic episodes in their study 
diary. The hypoglycemia will be reported in the specific e-CRF page with onset date and time, 
symptoms and/or signs, the SMBG value if available, and the treatment. If the event fulfills SAE criteria, hypoglycemia will also be reported as an SAE.  
Hypoglycemia is categorized according to the ADA workgroup on hypoglycemia classification 
(12,13) and summarized in Figure 1 . 
In addition to the threshold of ≤3.9 mmol/L ( ≤70 mg/dL), hypoglycemia episodes with a plasma 
glucose of <3.0 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL) will be analyzed separately.

Severe hypoglycemia 
Severe hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrate, glucagon, intravenous glucose or ot her resuscitative actions. These episodes may be 
associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure, unconsciousness or coma. 
Self-monitored plasma glucose values may not be available, but neurological  recovery attributable 
to the restoration of plasma gluc ose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. 
Note : “requiring assistance of another person” mean s that the patient could not help himself or 
herself to treat the hypoglycemia. Assisting a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not 
required, should not be considered a “requires assistance” incident. 
Any hypoglycemic event which leads to uncons ciousness, coma, or seizure should also be 
reported as an SAE.  
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typical symptoms of 
hypoglycemia accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤3.9 mmol/L 
(≤70 mg/dL).  
Clinical symptoms that are considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode are eg, increased sweating, nervousness, asthenia/weakness, tremor, dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, headache, sleep disorder, confusion, seizures, unconsciousness, or coma.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 80 Asymptomatic hypoglycemia 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia is an event not acco mpanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia 
but with a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤ 3.9 mmol/L ( ≤70 mg/dL).   
Note:  low plasma glucose values without symptoms  or signs should not be reported more than 
once within 30 minutes. Repeated low glucose valu es within a short period could be due to 
malfunction of the device, error te sting or following up a low glucose reading. The Investigator 
should try not to document false low SMBG va lues or redundant low glucose values as 
asymptomatic hypoglycemic event. Further clar ification with the patients is needed.     
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event du ring which symptoms of hypoglycemia are not 
accompanied by a plasma glucose determination, (but that was presumably caused by a plasma 
glucose concentration ≤ 3.9 mmol/L [ ≤70 mg/dL]), ie, symptoms treated with oral carbohydrate 
without  a test of plasma glucose.  
Relative hypoglycemia 
Relative hypoglycemia, recently termed “pseudo-hypoglycemia” ( 14) is an event during which the 
patient reports typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, and interprets the symptoms as indicative of 
hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose concentration >3.9 mmol/L (>70 mg/dL).

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
In the original version of this protocol, the sample size/power calculations were performed based 
on the primary variable, change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26. Assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 1.2% and using a 2-sided test at a 0.05 α-level, 120 patients per arm 
would have 95% power to detect  a treatment difference of 0.6% in mean HbA1c change from 
Baseline to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo. 
In the amended, current, version of this protocol, the sample size/power has been recalculated to 
account for the addition of the sotagliflozi n 200 mg treatment group after enrollment had 
commenced. Assuming a common SD of 1.2%  and using a 2-sided test at a 0.05 α-level, 
100 patients per ar m will have: 
• 94% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.6% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline 
to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo, and  
• 84% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.5% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline 
to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 200 mg and placebo. 
As a result, the total number of patients will include:  
• Approximately 100 patients from the initial randomization (1:1) according to the original 
protocol, balanced between place bo and sotagliflozin 400 mg, and
 
• Approximately 300 patients from the subsequent  randomization (1:1:1) according to the 
amended protocol, balanced between place bo, sotagliflozin 200 mg and sotagliflozin 
400 mg. 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
 
The total number of patients for each of the followi ng categories will be presented in the CSR:

• Run-in patients 
• Randomized patients: patients with a treatment  kit number allocated and recorded in IRT 
database, and regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or not

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 83 11.3.2 Safety population 
Safety analyses will be based on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who 
receive at least one dose of double-blind IM P (regardless of the amount of treatment 
administered). 
Patients will be analyzed for safety analyses acco rding to the treatment actually received, that is, 
sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo, and sotag liflozin 200 mg versus placebo (those randomized 
in the amended randomization and exposed to placebo only). In addition: 
• Nonrandomized but treated patie nts will not be part of the safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately 
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety population as randomized 
• When a patient is exposed to both sotagliflozi n and placebo, the patient will be analyzed in 
the appropriate sotagliflozin group (depending  on the treatment kits taken [400 mg or 
200 mg]) 
• When a patient is exposed to both sotag liflozin 400 mg (treatment kits) and 200 mg 
(treatment kits), the patient will be analyzed in the sotagliflozin 200 mg group 
• Randomized patients will be excluded from the safety population only if there is 
documented evidence (ie, all study dates reco rded as no medication taken) that patients 
have not taken the study medication 
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Continuous data will be summa rized by treatment group using the number of observations 
available, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum. Categorical data will be su mmarized by treatment group us ing count and percentage. 
In general, descriptive statistics of quantitative efficacy and safety parameters (result and change 
from Baseline) by scheduled visits will be provided on observed cases (OC), ie, inclusion of only patients having non-missing asse ssments at a specific visit. 
The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before the first dose of 
double-blind IMP or the last available value prior to randomization for patients who were randomized but never exposed to IMP. 
For serum creatinine and eGFR, the Baseline value is  defined as the average of all values before 
the first dose of double-blind IMP for those rando mized and exposed or before randomization for 
those who were randomized but never exposed to IMP.

11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by actual treatment received in the safety population. 
11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The extent of study treatment exposure will be assessed by the duration of treatment exposure during the study.  
The duration of treatment exposure will be the total number of days of administration of the 
double-blind IMP, regardless of unplanned interm ittent discontinuations . The duration of IMP 
exposure will be calculated as: 
(Date of the last double-blind IMP taken – Date of the first double-blind IMP taken) + 1. The number (%) of patients randomized and exposed to double-blind IMP will be presented by 
specific time periods for each treatment group. The time  periods of interest will be defined in the 
SAP. 
Descriptive statistics of duration of treatment  exposure (number, mean, SD, minimum, median, 
and maximum) and cumulative expos ure in patient year will also be presented by treatment group 
in the safety population. 
11.4.1.2 Compliance 
A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by the protocol. No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data.  
Treatment compliance, above-p lanned and under-planned dosing pe rcentages will be summarized 
descriptively (N, mean, SD, medi an, min, and max). The percentage  of patients with compliance 
<80% will be summarized. In addition, the number and percentage of patients with at least 1 
above-planned dosing administra tion will be given, as well as the number and percentage of 
patients with 0, >0 to 20% , and >20% under-planned dosing administrations.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 85 Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (cha nge from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c; see 
Section  9.1.1) will be performed on the ITT populati on, using HbA1c measurements obtained 
during the study, including those obtained afte r IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue 
therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 will be analyzed 
with missing values imputed by control-base d multiple imputation method under the missing not 
at random frame work.  
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data, 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin 400 mg group, missing data will be imputed as if the 
patients were on placebo throughout the study, where all patients’ measurements including 
the on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model. 
Each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment groups (sotagliflozin 400 mg, placebo), randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.0%, 
>8.0%), randomization stratum of SBP (<130, ≥130 mmHg), and country as fixed effects, and 
baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. Results fro m each complete dataset will be combined to 
provide the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, 
as well as the between-group difference (comparing  sotagliflozin 400 mg vs placebo) and the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the difference.  
Summary statistics (for Screening value, Baselin e value, observed values, and observed changes 
from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided for each treatment group. The summary will 
include the number of observations, mean, SD , standard error (SE), minimum, median, and 
maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean values (±SE) and mean changes from baseline (±SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using OC). 
Assessment of treatment effect by subgroup 
Descriptive analyses will be performed on the primary endpoint to summarize the treatment 
effects across subgroups defined by the fo llowing Baseline or Screening factors: 
• Race 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic, Not Hispanic) 
• Age group (<50, ≥50 to <65, ≥ 65 years) 
• Gender 
• Baseline BMI level (<30, ≥30 kg/m²) 
• Baseline HbA1c ( ≤8.0%, >8.0%) 
• Baseline HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%)  
• Baseline SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg)

the change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c in the ITT population, and using a similar 
approach to the analysis for the primary effica cy endpoint. The adjusted estimates of treatment 
mean differences (sotagliflozin 400 mg versus pl acebo) with SE and 95% CIs will be provided as 
appropriate across the subgroups. 
In the case that the subgroup factor is identi cal or similar to a randomization strata factor 
(eg, baseline HbA1c category), only the subgroup fact or will be included in the model in order to 
avoid the issue of collinearity in the analysis. 
11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary endpoints (see Section  9.1.2) will be analyzed using a similar approach to the 
primary efficacy endpoint with missing values  imputed by control-ba sed multiple imputation 
method under the missing not at random frame work.  To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo (those randomized to placebo): 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data, 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin 400 mg group, missing data will be imputed as if the 
patients were in the placebo group throughout the study, where all patients’ measurements 
including the on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model. 
To compare sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo (those randomized to placebo in the amended 
randomization only): 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data, 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin 200 mg group, missing data will be imputed as if the 
patients were in the placebo group throughout the study, where all patients’ measurements including the on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model. 
For each of the continuous secondary endpoints, each  of the complete datasets will be analyzed by 
an ANCOVA model. To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo, the model will include 
treatment groups (sotagliflozin 400 mg, pl acebo), randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.0%, 
>8.0%), randomization stratum of SBP (<130, ≥130 mmHg), and country as fixed effects, and 
baseline secondary endpoint value as a covari ate. To compare sotagliflozin 200 mg versus

stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.0%, >8.0%), randomizati on stratum of SBP (<130, ≥ 130 mmHg), and 
country as fixed effects, and baseline secondary endpoint value as a covariate. Results from each complete dataset will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change from Baseline to Week 26 (or Week 12 for SBP) for each treatment group, as well as the between-group difference (comparing each sotagliflozin group vs its corresponding placebo group) and the 95% CI for the difference.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 87 The categorical secondary efficacy variables of HbA1c <6.5%, <7% at Week 26 will be analyzed 
using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method stra tified by randomization stratum of HbA1c (≤ 8.0%, 
>8.0%), and randomization stratum of SBP (<130, ≥130 mmHg). The proportion in each 
treatment group will be provide d, as well as the difference of proportions between each 
sotagliflozin group and its corresponding placebo group with associated 2-sided 95% CI. For HbA1c responders at Week 26 (<6.5%, <7% respectively), all values at Week 26 will be used to determine whether a patient is a responder or not, even if they are measured after IMP 
discontinuation or rescue medica tion use. Patients who have no HbA1c measurement at Week 26 
will be treated as non-responders. 
For all secondary endpoints, summa ry statistics at scheduled visits will be provided for each 
treatment group. The summary will include the number of observations, mean, SD, SE, minimum, 
median, and maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean values (±SE) and mean changes from baseline (±SE) at each of the scheduled visits

Graphical presentations will also be used to illustrate trends over time. 
11.4.2.4 Multiplicity considerations 
To control the family-wise type I error, a fixed-sequence testing procedure will be applied.   
Once the primary variable (change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c) is statistically significant 
at α = 0.05 (2-sided), a hierarchical testing proced ure will be performed to  test the following 
secondary efficacy variables in the following prior itized order. The testing will stop as soon as an 
endpoint is found not to be statistically significant at α =0.05 (2-sided).

11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
Safety endpoints are presented in Section  9.2. The summary of safety results will be presented by 
treatment group. All safety analyses will be pe rformed on the Safety population as defined in 
Section  11.3.2 using the following common rules: 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters and vital signs: 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values for clinical laboratory 
tests and vital signs are define d as abnormal values considered  medically important by the 
Sponsor’s Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology department and in effect at the 
time of the final SAP approval. PCSA criteria for parameters not cited in the protocol as safety parameters will not be analyzed 
• PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-treatment 
period, taking into account all evaluations  performed during the on-treatment period, 
including unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the 
numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage 
The “observation periods” defined in Section  9.2.1  are applicable for classification of AEs, 
determination of on-treat ment PCSA values and the last on-treatment value for the laboratory, 
vital sign and ECG parameters. 
11.4.3.1 Analysis of adverse events 
Pre-treatment AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
pre-treatment period. 
Treatment-emergent AEs  (TEAEs) are AEs that developed or worsened (according to the 
Investigator’s opinion) or became se rious during the on-treatment period. 
Post-treatment AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
post-treatment period. The primary focus of AE reporting in the CSR will be on TEAEs. Pre- and post-treatment AEs 
will be described separately. 
All adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by 
internationally agreed order), high-level group te rm (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred 
term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurre nces of the same event in the same patient

information 
DEFINITIONS 
Nonreproductive potential 
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: - Documented hysterectomy 
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy 
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy. 
1. Postmenopausal - A postmenopausal state is defined as no mens es for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormone replacement therap y (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FS H measurement is insufficient.  
- Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must disc ontinue HRT to allo w confirmation of 
postmenopausal status before study enrolment. 
Reproductive potential  (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered of reproductive potential (WOCBP), ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently  sterile. Permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salp ingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. 
CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE 
Women of reproductive potential (WOCBP) must us e a highly effective method of contraception 
during the treatment period and the post-treatment follow up peri od (28 ±3 days). If another 
contraceptive method is used (such as a barrier method), it should be used in combination with 
one of the highly effective methods (such as an oral contraceptive).  
Female patients:

Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent 
• Implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Vasectomized partner 
(Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the 
sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method(s) of contraception should be used. 
Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.)  
• Sexual abstinence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.)  
NOTE: 
a) Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be 
consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for patients 
participating in clinical studies. 
 
 
 
COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Male patients with partners of reproductive potential who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male study patient who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. This applies

• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. 
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-study preg nancy which is considered reasonably related 
to the study treatment by the Investigator, w ill be reported to the S ponsor as described in 
Section  10.4.1.2. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 108 Appendix B Two-hour standardized mixed meal 
A 2-hour PPG will be obtained after a standardized MM in all patient s at Baseline (Day 1, Visit 3) 
and at Week 26 (Visit 9), or earlier if the patient  terminates study participation before Week 26. 
Any patient who requires the addition of rescue medication should undergo the second 
standardized MMTT at Visit 9 (Week 26).  
The standardized MM must not be done while pa tients are temporarily off IMP; the Medical 
Monitor will address any episodes on a case-by-case basis and the standardized MM will be 
rescheduled when the patient can resume IMP, if applicable. 
The first dose of double-blind IMP on Day 1 (Vis it 3) will be given AFTER completion of the 
2-hour PPG collection. For the Week 26 standardized MM, the patient should take the dose of 
double-blind IMP immediately after the fasting blood samples are obtained, and approximately 30 minutes before  ingestion of the standardized MM begins. 
Standard Meal for the Standardized Mixed Meal: 
The standard (breakfast) meal will be provided by the Sponsor as a liquid nutrition drink (Boost
®, 
Ensure®, or similar), with ~40 g carbohydrate and ~240 calories per bottle (~8 ounces). The 
caloric composition of the meal is ~ 65% carboh ydrate, ~15% protein, and ~20% fat. The amount 
given is 6 mL/kg body weight up to a ma ximum of 360 mL. Therefore for patients ≥60 kg, the 
standard meal consists of ~60 g carbohydrate and 360 calories.  
Patients are instructed to completely consume th e meal within 15 minutes, and every effort should 
be made to complete the meal within 20 minutes after it is started. Water or noncaffeinated, 
zero-calorie beverages may be consumed ad lib itum. No other food may be consumed until the 
2-hour postprandial plasma glucose sample has been collected. If the patient is unable to consume at least 50% of the standard meal during the MMTT at Baseline (Day 1, Visit 3), the patient 
should not be randomized. If a MMTT after randomization is not tolerated, e ffort should be made 
to repeat the testing at the discretion of the I nvestigator. If the patient  cannot tolerate MMTT upon 
repeat testing, this should be documented in the e-CRF with the reason and the patient should 
continue in the study. If the patient is able  to consume >50% of the standardized MM, the 
approximate amount should be recorded, and an equivalent amount should be consumed at the subsequent standardized MM.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 110 Appendix C Recommendations on basic ge nitourinary hygiene, maintaining 
hydration, and recognizing diabetic ketoacidosis 
Patients with T2D are at risk for developing GU infections. The following guidelines should be 
communicated to females and uncircumcised males regarding GU infections. Patient 
communication cards will be printed with the following: 
For females: “The following advice may be useful in helping you to keep your bladder and urethra free from 
infection: 
• Go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in.  
• Wipe from front to back after going to the toilet.  
• Practice good hygiene by washing your genitals every day, and before having sex.  
• Empty your bladder after having sex.”  
For uncircumcised males: “The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep the foreskin free from infection: 
• Wash the end of your penis and foreskin with  soap and water (do not let soap get in the 
opening).  
• After your shower or bath, dry the end of your  penis and foreskin properly and replace the 
foreskin.  
• Also, when you urinate, slide the foreskin back enough so that urine does not get on the 
foreskin-this helps to keep it clean.” 
Maintaining Hydration: 
Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and volume 
depletion, which may lead to dizz iness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. Before initiating 
study drug (at Screening, Run-in and Randomization)  and during all on-site st udy visits thereafter, 
assess volume status in patients with  renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low SBP, or if 
receiving diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme  inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. 
All patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasing it if they sense greater thirst, more urine producti on, or if they feel dizzy or faint. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following for patients with T2D: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to maintain prope r hydration and prevent 
dehydration: 
• Dehydration is when your body loses too mu ch fluid, frequently due to diarrhea or 
increased urination

- You sense greater thirst than usual 
- You have a dry mouth or cracked lips 
- You have a fever 
- You have diarrhea or vomiting  
- You urinate more frequently or in larger amounts than usual 
- You get up in the middle of the night to urinate (more than usual) 
- You feel dizzy or light-headed 
- You exercise, or when it is hot outside”  
Recognizing DKA 
Potential GI adverse events occurring with sotagliflozin may mask presenting symptoms of DKA. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
“If you have any of these symptoms on the list, then contact your study site immediately for 
assistance with managing your diabetes: 
• Inability to maintain oral intake  
• Generalized weakness  
• Abdominal (belly) pain  
• Increased weight loss 
• Fever  
• Frequent urination, including at night 
• Fruity-scented breath 
• Confusion 
• Acute illness  
• Consistently elevated blood glucose  
• Feeling very thirsty or drinking a lot 
• Nausea or vomiting 
• Having trouble thinking clearly or feeling tired 
It is possible to have DKA even if your blood glucose is not elevated. Regardless of your blood glucose level, if you have any of these sympto ms on the list, then contact your study site 
regarding the need to be evaluated for possible DKA, which will include specific blood testing. If 
your study site is closed and your study doctor is  not available, go to the nearest emergency room 
for evaluation.

surgery until after the procedure or surgery is co mplete, and you are taking food and liquids as 
you normally do.” 
Whenever AE data is collected or the patient  reports DKA or intercurrent illness (including 
infections), generalized weakness, increased weight loss, gastrointestinal symptoms including 
nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain or other symptoms or signs that the Investigator believes may be consistent with DKA, then the site  will determine if an assessment for DKA is 
appropriate. If laboratory testing confirms presence of metabolic acidosis, then the “Possible

Extraneous variables associated with the meas urement of BP should be minimized. These include: 
1. Food intake, caffeine-containing beverages,  cigarette smoking, or strenuous exercise 
within 2 hours prior to measurement 
2. Full urinary bladder 
3. The patient should not be allowed to talk while BP is being measured 
4. The patient should be placed in the examination room and the cuff should be placed on the 
patient’s nondominant arm. The proper sized cuff should fit snugly with the lower edge 2 to 3 cm above the antecubital fossa. 
5. The patient should be allowed to sit quietly in a comfortably warm place (temperature around 25°C or 77°F) for 5 minutes with the arm supported at heart level, preferably with 
the cuff in place and with no restrictive cl othing on the arm. The patient should be 
encouraged not to tense his or her muscles. 
Nondominant Arm 
The patient’s nondominant arm should be the arm d eclared by the patient as being nondominant. 
The nondominant arm should then be used for all s eated BP measurements throughout the study. 
Measurement Technique Following the 5-minute rest period, 3 separate seated BPs should be measured with at least 
1 minute between BP measurements and with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. 
All 3 BPs will be recorded in the patient’s e-CRF. The mean of the 3 seated BPs will constitute 
the BP value for that visit. 
Three seated pulse rate measurements will be obtained. The mean of the 3 seated pulse rate 
measurements will constitute the pulse rate value for that visit.

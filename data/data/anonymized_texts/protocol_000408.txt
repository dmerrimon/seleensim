 I. Objectives  
Primary Objective:  To compare the immune response to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV -
1) and general immune health in subjects if three groups, all of whom are infected with HSV -
1, as shown by having IgG against HSV -1: 
• A. Six (6) or more herpes labialis outbreaks in the past 12 months  
• B. One (1) to two (2) outbreaks in the past 12 months  
• C. Zero (0) outbreaks in the past 12 months  
 
Secondary  Objective:  To determine if and in what ways topical application of SADBE to the 
inner aspect of the upper arm in the group having 6 or more herpes labialis outbreaks in the 
past 12 months changes the immune response to HSV -1 and general immune health.   
II. Backgroun d 
Primary oral infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically occurs at a young age, is 
asymptomatic, and is not associated with significant morbidity. After primary oral infection, HSV 
may persist in a latent state in the trigeminal ganglion and later reactivate as the more common 
herpes labialis, or “cold sores.” Common triggers for reactivation are well known and include 
ultraviolet light, trauma, fatigue, stress, fever, inflammation, and menstruation. These lesions 
affect up to 45 percent of th e U.S. population. They classically manifest as a well -localized cluster 
of small vesicles along the vermilion border of the lip or adjacent skin. The vesicles subsequently 
rupture, ulcerate, and crust within 24 to 48 hours. Spontaneous healing occurs over  seven to 10 
days.  
In immunocompetent patients, herpes labialis usually is mild and self -limited. However, pain, 
swelling, and cosmetic concerns may prompt physician consultation. Orally administered antiviral 
agents, such as acyclovir (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex), have a modest clinical benefit if 
initiated during the prodrome. Topical treatment with 1% penci clovir cream (Denavir) may reduce 
healing time and pain slightly, even if initiated after the prodrome. However, reduction in healing 
time with systemic or topical agents is modest.  
Squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE) is a topical immunotherapeutic agent us ed in the treatment of 
verruca vulgaris and alopecia areata. During a  recent FDA Compounding Advisory Committee 
Meeting, it was recommended that squaric acid dibutylester be included on the list of bulk drug 
substances allowed for use in compounding under  section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act.   And SADBE has now been so listed under section 503A.  
 A study completed by Lee et al of 29 patients with recalcitrant warts demonstrated complete 
clearance in 69% of patients with application every 2 -4 weeks. Silverberg et al showed a 
complete clearance in 58% of patients (n=61) when SADBE was applied 3 times  weekly.  
SADBE has also been used with some success in the treatment of alopecia areata. In a review of 
the literature, Rokhsar et al noted a 50% to 60% success rate of SADBE in use for hair re -growth 
in this population.  
SADBE has been reported to cause e czema, lymphadenopathy, blistering, allergic contact 
dermatitis, skin hypopigmentation, a burning sensation after application, and systemic reactions 
including fever and arthralgias. A study completed by Oglio et al of eight patients treated with 
SADBE for  warts noted only mild and well tolerated side effects of erythema, desquamation, 
cutaneous edema, pruritus, burning, and pain.  
SADBE induces a delayed -type hypersensitivity response which in warts, is believed to induce 
the killing of virally infected ce lls by cytotoxic lymphocytes. This influx of lymphocytes into lesional 
 Page 4 of 14 
 tissue may also enhance the recognition and processing of viral antigens, leading to clonal 
expansion of effector cells. It is hoped that SADBE will offer subjects a safe and effective 
therapeutic option to decrease the frequency and severity of future herpes labialis outbreaks 
through these mechanisms.  
A placebo -controlled clinical study completed at Massachusetts General Hospital showed  that 
squaric acid prevented recurrence of herpet ic lesions .  The effect of SADBE of delaying new 
herpes labialis outbreaks was highly significant  (p<0.01)  as compared to placebo.    (Throughout 
this document, where the term "squaric acid" is used, it refers to squaric acid dibutyl ester 
(SADBE).)  
III. Outcomes  
Primary Outcome Measure:  
Tests:  
• Lymphocyte, T cell, B cell, CD4, CD8, natural k iller cells counts  
• Serum cytokine levels  (IL2R, IL12, INFG, IL4, IL5, IL10, IL13, IL1B, IL6, IL8, TNFA, 
IL2, IL17)  
• Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation to  
o CANDIN   
o negative control    
o heat inactivated HSV -1  
o cell extracts of HSV -1-infected cells  
o positive control ( concanavalin A)  
• RNA gene expression arrays for 42 cytokine and immune related genes assayed on 
RNA isolated from PBMCs 2 days after stimulation in vitro in the first 4 conditions 
above for PBMC proliferation.    
 
The first part of the study would test for w hat parameters differ between subjects with no cold 
sores, infrequent, or frequent cold sores, and the secon d part of the study would test whether and 
SADBE affects the same parameters in subjects  with frequent cold sores.

• Group B: 12 subjects with 1 to 2 outbreaks in the past 12 months  
• Group C: 12 subjects with zero outbreaks in the past 12 months  
Subjects in group  A will receive 2% SADBE dose on the arm after their initial blood samples are 
obtained.  Group A subjects will have blood collected and tests repeated 2 and 8 weeks later.  
 
 Page 6 of 14 
 Subjects in Groups B and C will be matched to the subjects in Group A  so that demographic 
characteristics (i.e., gender  distribution, age and weight) are within broadly similar ranges.  
 
 
V. Subject Enrollment  
 
Preliminary eligibility will be determined based on study staff interviews of interested subjects 
over the phone. Eligible subjects will then be scheduled for a screening visit. Approximately 
fifteen subjects will be recruited for Group A, approximately 30  subjects will be recruited for Group 
B and approximately 60 subjects will be recruited for Group C.  
 
 
A. Methods of Enrollment  
   
All subjects who sign an informed consent form (ICF) and are screened will be  documented 
on the enrollment log. A note will be m ade in the source documentation verifying that the 
subject has willingly signed the ICF prior to participation in any study procedures. All enrolled  
subjects will receive a subject number  to ensure their  protected  health information (PHI) and 
subject anony mity. Adult men and women of any  race or and ethnic group may participate  in 
this study . Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control while in 
the study and for a period of one month after use of the study medication . No minors (i.e., 
<18 years of age) will be included in this study.  
 
B. Informed Consent  
 
The Investigator or sub -investigator will inform the potential study subject of all aspects of the 
study and answer all their questions. If the subject  agrees to be a study subject, they will 
document their consent in writing by signing an ICF. If a subject needs more time to think 
about study participation, they will be given a copy of the consent and sign it upon return if 
they elect to participate. Th e investigator is responsible for using a consent form that has 
been approved by the IRB and is the most current version. If a new version of the consent 
form is approved by the IRB while a subject is in the treatment portion of the study, then the 
investi gator or designee will inform the subject of the changes and, if the subject agrees to 
continue treatment, both the investigator and subject should  sign the updated form.  
 
VI. Study Procedures

IX. Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject at the initiation of the screening visit.  
In all cases, the consent will be witnessed by an appropriate health care professional. A copy of 
the signed consent form will be given to the subject to  keep. All efforts will be made to insure the 
privacy rights of the study subject.  
 
A. Study Drug Management  
 
Study medication will be provided by Squarex and shipped directly to Prism Research . 
 
 Page 10 of 14 
 All study medicati ons will be retained in secure and restricted access storage by the Investigator’s 
designee for the duratio n of the study. All study medication will  be stored at room temperature 
and conditions (59 -77ºF or 15 -25ºC).  Controlled access to study medications will be maintained 
until Squarex, Inc. has completed final drug accountability and provided instructions for drug 
return and destruction.  
  
 
B. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
This study is considered to be moderate risk to human subjects as the study drug is not FDA 
approved, but is commonly used for treatment of warts and alopecia areata.  
 
C. Data and Drug Handling Guidelines  
 
Data will be transcribed  on case report forms and wi ll be complete and  accurate based on 
available source documentation.  Corrections of data will be made in a manner that allows 
Squarex  to track changes according to FDA regulations. The investigator will respond to inquiries 
regarding data errors, inconsis tencies, and missing data in a timely fashion.   
 
The study site will keep all study records, including source docs, CRFs, signed ICFs, regulatory 
papers, patient logs, drug accountability logs, etc. until Squarex  determines that they can be 
returned or destroyed.  The investigator will follow the procedures outlined in the protocol and 
discuss any deviations with Squarex .   
 
D. Site Monitoring of Source Data  
 
The principal investigator and members of the study staff not directly involved in clinical 
assessments or clinical study procedures will monitor the study. All data relevant to the 
assessments outlined in this protocol will be recorded in the case report form (CRF) and the 
subject’s sourcebook.  
 
The original cas e report form for each subject will be audited to source documents at the study 
site by the study monitor. The study staff monitor will review the progress of the study to ensure 
proper study conduct and accurate data collections through ongoing reviews of  Case Report 
Forms, clinical records, and administrative documents. Reviews will be made at least once a 
month.  
  
 
E. Sponsor Monitoring of Study Data  
 
Representatives of Squarex  will also monitor this study’s data regularly via scheduled monitoring 
visits. Monitoring procedures include pre -study preparations, site initiation visit, interim monitoring 
visits, and study close -out preparations and visits. During sponsor’s visits, th e Investigator will 
provide Squarex ’s monitors with access to all protocol regulatory documents, all medical data 
collected on the participating subjects, screening logs, enrollment logs, drug accountability logs 
and the drug supply, case report forms, sig ned informed consent forms, and any other 
information that Squarex  may consider to be necessary to evaluate the safety  of the 
investigational product and patient safety.   Both the monitors and study staff will review the 
accuracy and completeness of case report form entries, all log entries, source documents, and 
informed consent documents.    
 
F. Adverse event reporting gu idelines  
 
 Page 11 of 14 
 Definitions  
 
Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject that does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally a ssociated with the use of an investigational 
product, whether or not related to the investigational product.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• Result s in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• Is another medically important condition  
 
 
Reporting and Documenting Adverse Events  
 
All untoward medical occurrences that occur after the subject signs a consent form should be 
documented as an AE. The Investigator should ensure that all events that occur during the study 
period are recorded. All AEs should be followed until resolution or until, in th e Investigator’s 
judgment, they are chronic and stable. If an emergency situation should occur, appropriate 
medical measures should be taken to stabilize the subject.  
 
Documentation of AEs includes: date and time of onset and resolution of AE, intensity, f requency, 
seriousness, related interventions and outcome. The Investigator must also evaluate the 
probability of a causal relationship of the AE to the study treatment as being: “definite, probable, 
possible, unlikely, or unrelated.” Intensity of adverse e vents will be graded as mild, moderate, or 
severe according to the following criteria:  
 
Mild: symptoms that are easily tolerated and transient in nature with minimal or no impairment of 
normal activity  
Moderate: symptoms that are poorly tolerated, are sust ained, and interfere with normal activity  
Severe: symptoms that are incapacitating and render the subject unable to work or participate in 
many or all usual activities  
 
All SAEs will be reported to the IRB according to the IRB’s requirements. They will als o be 
reported to the study sponsor and FDA according to regulatory guidelines.  
 
 
Study Discontinuation  
 
At any time after enrollment, a subject may be discontinued. Reasons for discontinuation of a 
subject from the study will include, but may not be limite d to, the following:  
• Subject is found to be intolerant to a required study procedure at any time point  
• Subject experiences a serious adverse experience at any time point.  
• Subject develops an inter -current illness that would, in the judgment of the investi gator, 
affect assessments of clinical status to a significant degree.  
• Subject begins a medication that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect 
assessments of clinical status to a significant degree.  
• Subject becomes pregnant while participating in  the study  
• Subject enrolls in another investigational study  
• Subject requests to withdraw from the study  
• The study sponsor decides to suspend or terminate the study.

X. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS software. Default estimation methods in version 
9.4 of SAS are always used unless an alternative is specified below. In general, data summaries 
will include the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values for continuous 
data; the median, 2 5th and 75th percentiles, minimum and maximum values for time -to-event 
endpoints  (if any) ; and the number and percentage of patients in each category for categorical 
data. Pointwise 95% confidence intervals (CI) will also be estimated for the mean (continu ous 
data), median (time -to-event endpoints) or percentage of patients (categorical data).  A series of 
power transformations (including the log transformation) may be applied to observed values of 
continuous outcome measures if the distribution of raw (i.e. , untransformed) data to not appear to 
follow a normal distribution.  
 
There is no plan for case -control matching that would permit pairing of subjects in Group A with 
patient in Groups B and C. Therefore, unpaired data analyses will be performed on screeni ng 
data across the three groups. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models will be fit to numeric 
outcome measures such as s erum cytokine levels . Any categorical outcome measures will be 
summarized using within -group frequency tables.  
 
Longitudinal data from pat ients in Group A (screening to Weeks 3 and 8) will be analyzed using 
statistical techniques appropriate for paired observations such as 95% confidence intervals for 
the difference between screening and follow -up values.  
 
No interim data analyses are planne d.  
 
Sample Size  
 
The primary and secondary objectives of this study will be addressed with descriptive statistics 
and subjective comparisons of outcome measures between the three groups and within Group A 
from screening to Weeks 3 and 8. Although statistical methods will be employed to estimate 
means, variances and confidence intervals, no formal statistical hypotheses will be tested. 
Therefore the sample size of 12 subjects per group (36 subjects total) was selected purely based 
on clinical judgem ent. 
 
Safety Analyses  
 
Reported adverse event (AE) terms will be mapped to MedDRA preferred terminology. All 
reported events will appear in AE listings, however only treatment -emergent adverse events will 
be summarized. A treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE) is an AE that starts or increases in 
severity any time after the first application  of any study drug up to 30 days following the last 
application  of any study drug. Therefore, by definition and study design, only patients in Group A 
can experience TE AEs.

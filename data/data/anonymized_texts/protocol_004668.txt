Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
RATIONALE FOR AMENDMENT  
This protocol amendment  is required due to a change in the calibration of the device employed in 
methemoglobin readings and increases the upper limit of methemoglobin for study enrollment  
from >  2.0% to >  3.0% and changes the criteri on for subject discontinuation in the study due to 
elevated methemoglobin from >  3.0% to >  5.0%.  The change in methemoglobin levels 
permissible for study enrollment and continuation reflect this change in the calibration of the 
device. The amendment also increases the screening period from 28 days to 35 days  to 
accommodate the w ashout period.  The protocol was edited to ensure consistency across 
sections.

Title  A Phase 2 , Multi -Center, Randomized, Evaluator -Blinded, Vehicle -
Controlled Study Comparing the Efficacy, Tolerability , and Safety of 
SB204 Gel and Vehicle Gel Once or Twice Daily in the Treatment of 
Acne Vulgaris  
Study Objectives  The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, 
tolerability , and safety of two concentrations of SB204 Gel and Vehicle 
Gel once or twice daily for 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to 
severe acne vulgaris  on the face . 
Treatment Regimens  Eligible subjects at the Baseline visit will be randomized 2:2:2:1:1 to 
SB204 4% Gel BID, SB204 4% Gel QD, SB204 2% Gel BID, Vehicle 
Gel BID, or Vehicle Gel QD and treated for 12 weeks (84 days).  
Formulation  Investigational Drug:   SB204 4% Gel  
Investigational Drug:   SB204 2% Gel  
Comparator Drug : Vehicle Gel  
Study Period  Subjects will be dosed in the study for up to 12 weeks.  
Study Design  This is a multi -center, evaluator -blinded, randomized, vehicle -
controlled, parallel -group  study to be conducted in approximately 200 
subjects with acne vulgaris. 
Subjects who satisfy the entry criteria will be randomized to SB204 4% 
Gel BID, SB204 4% Gel QD, SB204 2% Gel BID, Vehicle Gel BID , or 
Vehicle Gel QD in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio.  The SB204 Gel and Vehicle Gel 
will be delivered from a double barrel single pump dispenser.  The pump dispenses product from two  chambers (NVN1000 Gel and a 
hydrogel or Vehicle Gel and a hydrogel) which will be mixed together in the palm for 5- 10 seconds  by the subject and applied to the entire 
face once or twice daily after washing.  Efficacy assessments will include investigator global assessments (IGA) and inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts.  Tolerability and safety assessments 
include cut aneous tolerability evaluation (erythema, scaling, dryness, 
pruritus, burning/stinging), adverse event collection, physical exams, blood pressure and pulse rate, laboratory assessments including chemistry, hematology, methemoglobin, PT/ PTT measurements, and 
urine pregnancy tests (UPTs).  Subjects will return for post -baseline 
evaluation at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

Sample Size  Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 
2:2:2:1:1 ratio (~50 in each  active arm and 25 in each vehicle arm).    
Efficacy Evaluation  The same blinded evaluator will perform Investigator Global 
Assessments and lesion counting at Screening, Baseline , and Weeks 2, 
4, 8, and 12.  In the event that this is not possible due to unforeseen circumstances, a different blinded evaluator  will evaluate the s ubject.  
However, the same evaluator should evaluate subjects at the Baseline and Week 12 evaluations. 
Investigator Global Assessment (IGA)  
The IGA score will be determined based on the Investigator evaluation of the overall signs and symptoms of acne vulg aris.  IGA evaluations  
will be performed prior to the lesion counts, approximately 3 feet from the subject, and scored on a scale of 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) .  
Lesion Counts  
At Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, the Investigator will count the total number of non- inflammatory and inflammatory lesions 
on the subject’s face including the forehead, right and left cheeks, chin and nose.  Non- inflammatory lesion count will include the number of 
open and closed comedones , which will be recorded separately .

and cysts  will be reported separately and included  with the 
inflammatory lesion counts.    
Tolerability 
Evaluation Subjects will be assessed at each visit from Baseline through Week 12 
for cutaneous tolerability.  Tolerability will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3= severe for erythema, 
scaling, dryness, pruritus, and burning/stinging.  
Safety Evaluation  Adverse events will be assessed and collected at each evaluation 
beginning at Screening.  A brief physical exam will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and Week 12/Early Termination (ET).  Blood 
pressure and pulse will be measured at Screening, Baseline, and each visit through Week 12/ET.  Any clinically significant changes noted during the physical exam as well as from the change in vital sign measurements or saf ety laboratory assessments will be recorded as 
adverse events.  Methemoglobin will be measured with a pulse co-oximeter and recorded at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 2 and 12/ET.  Chemistry, hematology, and PT/PTT will be assessed at Screening, Baseline, and Week 12.  Urine pregnancy tests in women of child-
bearing potential will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/ET. 
Additional Evaluations  Photographs of the face will be taken at Baseline and Week 12/ET.

Endpoints  Primary Efficacy Endpoints The co -primary efficacy endpoints are:  
a.  The absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline 
to Week 12;  
b.  The absolute change in non- inflammatory lesion count from 
Baseline to Week 12;  
c.  The proportion of success according to the dichotomized IGA.  
A subject will be considered a success if the IGA at Week 12 is 
clear or almost clear and is at least 2 grades less than Baseline.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  The secondary endpoints include t he 
following:  
a.  The percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline 
to Week 12;  
b.  The percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from 
Baseline to Week 12;  
c. The median time to improvement.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated.  Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed 
tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of ≤ 0.05 unless stated 
otherwise. Inferential testing will compare eac h active treatment group 
to the combined Vehicle treatment group.  Comparisons will not be 
performed between active treatments.  Efficacy analyses will be 
performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) and per -protocol (PP) 
populations with the ITT population c onsidered as primary.  Safety 
analyses will be performed using the safety population. For the dichotomized IGA, subjects will be considered a success if their IGA score is clear or almost clear and at least two grade s less than 
Baseline. For those subjects  for whom no Week 12 assessments are 
available, the last observation will be carried forward (LOCF) in order to provide a value for efficacy parameters that are missing, primarily due to missed visits.   Additionally, a sensitivity analysis to estimate missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the method of 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) independently for each treatment group. All hypotheses will be two- sided at an alpha level of 0.05.  
Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics will be pre sented for the efficacy data at each 
evaluation for the ITT and PP populations.  Safety data will be 
summarized as indicated below for the safety population.  Continuous

data will be summarized with sample size (N), mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimu m and maximum.  Categorical data will be 
summarized with N, frequency counts, and percentages.  Descriptive 
statistics will be presented for the active treatment groups, each vehicle treatment group, and the vehicle treatment groups combined. 
Efficacy Anal ysis 
Lesion counts will be summarized at each evaluation from Baseline through Week 12.  Absolute and percent change in lesion counts will be summarized at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  IGA scores will be summarized from baseline through Week 12.  The dichotomiz ed IGA 
scores will be summarized at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The analysis of the absolute change in non- inflammatory lesion counts 
at Week 12 will be conducted using an analysis of covariance with factor of treatment and baseline lesion count as the covariate.  The analysis of the absolute change in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12 will use the same method as the analysis of the non- inflammatory 
lesions. 
The analysis of the dichotomized IGA scores at Week 12 will be 
analyzed with a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Pairwise comparisons of each active treatment group to the combined vehicle treatment group will be computed without concern for controlling for multiplicity.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The analyses of percent change in inflammatory and non- inflammatory 
lesion counts at Week 12 will use the same method as the analysis of the non- inflammatory lesions.  
The time to improvement will be compared between each of the active treatment groups and the combined Vehicle treatment group using the Kaplan -Meier method.  An observation will be censored if 
improvement is not achieved by Week 12 (inclusive).  The log -rank test 
will be used to compare time to response between each active treatment 
group and the combined Vehicle treatment group.

Safety Analyses  
Adverse Events  
All AEs that occur during the study will be recorded and classified on 
the basis of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
terminology.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs 
with an onset on or after the date of the first study drug dose.  Adverse 
events noted prior to the first study drug administration that worsen 
after Baseline will also be reported as AEs and included in the 
summaries.  
All information pertaining to an AE no ted during the study will be 
listed by subject, detailing verbatim term given by the PI or designee, 
preferred term, system organ class (SOC), onset date, resolution date, severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, and drug relatedness.  The event onset  will also be shown relative (in number of days) to date of 
first dose.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by treatment group, the 
number of subjects reporting a TEAE, SOC, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug (causality), and seriousness.  
Serious AEs will be summarized by treatment group, severity, and 
relationship to study drug, and individual SAEs will be listed by subject. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to an AE will be provided.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease  characterized by open and closed comedones, papules, 
pustules, and cysts.  Current acne t herapies includ e oral and topical antibiotics, topical 
keratolytics, and oral contraceptives .   
Nitric oxide is a free radical gas naturally produced by the human bod y which has antimicrobial 
and anti -inflammatory activity.  Novan , Inc.  has developed a topical gel containing NVN1000, a 
drug which releases nitric oxide to the skin after topical application.  SB204, compris ing an 
admixture of an alcoholic NVN1000 Gel wit h an aqueous  hydrogel, i s in development for the 
treatment of acne vulgaris .  In a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 12 week, Phase 2 
study, SB204 decreased inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion counts in subjects with acne 
and was well tole rated.   
To date, approximately 240 subjects  have been treated with NVN1000 Gel, including SB204,  
and 150 subjects have been treated with the vehicle gel .  
1.2 INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT  
NVN1000 has been developed to deliver controlled release of nitric oxide fr om micron sized 
polysiloxane macromolecules .  The active agent is formulated into an alcohol -based topical ge l 
and the formulation will be dispensed from a dual chamber pump.

1.3 NONCLINICAL ST UDIES WITH NVN1000 GEL  
The development program for NVN1000 Gel  includes over 25 non- clinical studies to assess 
safety following topical application.  Studies performed to date with NVN1000 demonstrated  the 
safety of the inert carrier silica particles and the lack of systemic silica particle bioavailability 
when applied topically.  Following daily topical administration of NVN1000 Gel  to rats (at doses 
of 6, 12, and 20%) for five days or to miniature pig s (at doses of 6, 12, and 20%) for 28 days 
(10% TBSA), systemic exposure (blood levels) of nitrate and silicon were not statistically different from background levels.  The in -life portion of a 13- week  dermal toxicity study in mini-
pigs has been completed;  no significant findings have been noted to date.   In a 13 -week dermal 
toxicity study in rats, local application events led to unscheduled study termination of all dose 
groups in a time -dependent manner.  
Pharmacokinetic studies to  date in rats with the NVN1000 Gel have led to no appreciable 
systemic bioavailability (<2%) of NVN1000 or related compounds following repeated topical 
administration  as assessed by nitrate as a marker for nitric oxide exposure and silicon as a marker 
for the polysiloxane backbone of NVN1000.  S ilicon and nitrate were detected in blood only 
sporadically and at the same frequency and levels found in pre -dose blood samples.  Co-
administration of NVN1000 Gel with hydrogel did not impact the pharmacokinetics.  
NVN1000 Gel demonstrated mutagenicity in an Ames assay, but was  not mutagenic in two in 
vivo genotoxicity tests in two tissue types : bone marrow via IP administration and skin via 
topical administration.  
For additional information refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4 CLINICAL STUDIES WITH  NVN1000  GEL  
The topical administration of NVN1000 Gel to healthy volunteers or subjects with acne vulgaris 
has generally been well -tolerated with no safety concerns identified.  In seven completed clinical 
studies, approximately 2 40 subjects have  been treated with NVN1000 Gel or SB204 Gel and 
approximately 150 subjects have been treated with Vehicle Gel.  No SAEs have been reported and the AE profile has been similar in subjects treated with active (NVN1000  or SB204 Gel ) and 
vehicle.  Asymptomatic , transient erythema has been observed in some subjects treated with 
higher concentrations of NVN1000. There have been no clinically significant changes in 
laboratory results including methemoglobin, or changes in physical examinations.  A cross -over 
pharm acokinetic (PK) study was conducted in 18 subjects with moderate to severe acne. Subjects 
received nine applications of SB204 8% Gel or Vehicle Gel to the face, chest, upper back, and 
shoulders (~17% TBSA) over five days, had a nine day washout, then cross ed over to the other 
treatment for nine applications over five days.  PK analysis of samples for nitrate and silicon is 
pending.  One subject withdrew during the second dosing period due to contact dermatitis.  In a 
psoriasis microplaque assay, local appli cation -site reactions following application of alcoholic

NVN1000 Gel or Vehicle Gel under occlusion were observed in some treated subjects that led to 
treatment discontinuations.

1.5 SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS  
The pathogenesis of a cne vulgaris includes several mechanisms which are potential targets for  
nitric oxide.  Nitric oxide has been demonstrated in vitro to decrease sebum production, decrease 
P. acnes , alter keratinocyte differentiation , and inhibit inflammasome activation .  In a recently 
completed Phase 2 study, SB204 4% Gel administered twice daily in subjects with acne 
decreased inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts at the end of treatment.  In the 
studies conducted to date, the AE profile was similar between subj ects treated with NVN1000 
Gel, SB204 Gel, and subjects treated with Vehicle Gel.  NVN1000 Gel at 2%, 4%, and 8% 
concentrations was well tolerated and was not associated with a safety or tolerability signal.  
Nitric oxide released from NVN1000 is anticipated  to be pharmacologically active in the skin.  
Any nitric oxide absorbed through the skin would be extremely short -lived (milliseconds) with 
rapid auto- oxidation to nitrite and nitrate.  Systemic bioavailability of NVN1000 or related 
compounds following repeated topical administration of NVN1000 Gel was  < 2% in non- clinical 
pharmacokinetic studies  conducted to date  both with and without hydrogel .   
Dermal toxicology studies have demonstrated minimal evidence of toxicity in a 28 day miniature 
pig study dosed with 20% NVN1000 Gel across 10% TBSA, low dermal irritation in rabbits, and 
no dermal sensitization in guinea pigs.  A 13-week  dermal toxicology stud y in mini- pigs with 
NVN1000 2%, 4%, and 8% Gel (10% TBSA) has completed the in -life period with no 
signific ant observed effects; histopathology and toxicokinetics data will be available prior to 
enrollment in the current study.  Local application site events in a 1 3 week dermal toxicology 
study in rats with NVN1000 2%, 4%, and 8% Gel (10% TBSA) led to premature discontinuation 
of all dose groups in a time -dependent manner.  These local adverse effects seen in the rat study 
are species specific and monitorable.  Tolerability will be assessed during the planned study , and 
discontinuation criteria f or intolerance by subjects is de scribed in Section 6.7. 
Based on the known mechanism of action of nitric oxide, theoretical risks from systemic 
exposure following t opical  administration of  NVN1000 Gel or SB204 Gel include hypotension 
and headache.  Methemoglobinemia has been reported in patients trea ted with inhaled nitric 
oxide .  Methemoglobin will be monitored during the study and treatment stopped in any subject 
with a measured methemoglobin > 5.0%.  
Inadvertent administration to the eyes may result in ocular irritation and should be avoided.  Should the product be accidently instilled in the eye(s), prompt flushing with copious amount of 
normal saline or water is r ecommended.   
A transient (approximately 5 -10 minutes), asymptomatic erythema has been observed in some 
subjects shortly after application of NVN1000 Gel or SB204 Gel which is a physiologic response

Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
(vasodilation) to local nitric oxide release.  Topical application has been associated with local 
application -site reactions including erythema, peeling, desquamation, or burning/stinging .  These 
local application -site reactions may occur due to the active agent (NVN1000) or the vehicle.  
Local application -site events including erosions and contact dermatitis were reported in subjects 
with psoriasis treated with NVN 1000 Gel and Vehicle Gel  under occlusion.  These local 
application -site reactions resolved after discontinuation of the product and by the end of the 
study.  
Based on available data, Novan anticipates that the risks to subjects enrolling in this Phase 2  
study at which the maximum strength of SB204 Gel will be 4% twice daily to  approximately 4 
percent total body surface area are minimal, and that appropriate monitoring is in place to assess 
safety.  At this stage of development, it is unknown if a clinical benefit will be observed in 
subjects with acne vulgaris following treatment for 12 weeks.   
2. RATIONALE AND OBJECT IVES  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Novan is conducting this study  to evaluate the efficacy, cutaneous  tolerability  and safety of      
SB 204 2% Gel, SB204 4 % Gel and Vehicle Gel  administered  once or  twice daily to the face.  
Subjects will dose once  (in the evening)  or twice daily (morning and evening ) for up to 12 weeks 
(84 days)  with SB204 4% Gel, twice daily with SB204 2% Gel, or  once or twice daily with 
Vehicle Gel .  Approximately 0.9 g of gel (three (3) pump strokes) will be applied evenly over the 
face (4% TBSA) .  Based on the previous hum an safety data with SB204 Gel at up to 8% and 
Vehicle Gel  as well as the nonclinical safety data including dosing with and without hydrogel , 
this dose is  expected to be safe and well tolerated.  
2.2 STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
The primary objective of this study is to compare efficacy, tolerability and safety of two 
concentrations of SB204 Gel and Vehicle Gel  once or twice daily for 12 weeks in subjects with 
acne vulgaris .  
3. STUDY DESIGN 
Figure 1 depicts the overall study design for this 12 week, 5 arm, randomized, evaluator blinded 
study in subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris dosed once or twice daily with SB204 
and Gel Vehicle.  Subjects receiving current treatment for acne vulgaris may enter a wash out 
period after screening of up to 35 days prior to randomization.

The cutaneous tolerability assessments the investigator’s assessment of erythema, scaling, 
dryness, and the subject ’s report of pruritus and burning/stinging based on the preceding 24 
hours. 
3.1.3 SAFETY ENDPOINTS  
Safety endpoints will include the change from ba seline in percent methemoglobin, change from 
baseline vital sign measurements and in chemistry, hematology, and PT/PTT values, and the 
comparison of adverse events between groups.  Any clinically significant changes noted during the physical exam as well as from the vital sign measurements, or safety laboratory assessments 
will be recorded as adverse events and included in the comparison.  
3.2 STRUCTURE  
This is a multi- center, randomized, evaluator -blinde d, vehicle -controlled, 5 -arm study . 
3.3 DURATION  
Subjects will be in the study for a maximum of 17 weeks including up to 35 days for screening 
followed by up to 84 days of treat ment .   
3.4 DOSAGE/DOSE REGIMEN 
Approximately 0.9 g of SB204 2% Gel, SB204 4% Gel, or Vehicle Gel  will be applied evenly 
over the entire face once or twice  a day for a period of  up to 84 days.  The product will be 
dispensed from a dual -chamber  pump designed to deliver approximately equal amounts of 
NVN1000 Gel and hydrogel or Vehicle Gel  and hydrogel.  The NVN1000 Gel and Vehicle Gel  
will be opaque and the hydrogel will be clear.  The subject  will instantly mix the two substances 
in the palm of the hand and then immediatel y massage  a thin layer  over the entire face once or 
twice daily after washing .  The product should be mixed for 5- 10 seconds until thoroughly 
combined with a uniform opaque appearance then applied with the fingertips (Appendix 2).  
Subjects assigned to once daily dosing should apply their dose at bedtime.  
3.5 VISIT SCHEDULE

4.1.7 DISCONTINUATION/ WITHDRAWAL P ROCEDURES  
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time.  If the subject 
withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the Investigator will attempt to determine 
the reason for discontinuation and record the reason in the subject’s stu dy records  and in the 
study database.  If a subject is withdrawn because  of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the 
reason for withdrawal.  In the event of early discontinuation, (i.e., prior to Week 12 /Day 84  visit)  
and whenever possible, the subject should be asked to return to the study center to complete the 
Week 12 /ET evaluations.   Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
If at any time during the study  the Investigator determines that it is not in the best interest of  the 
subject t o continue, the subject will be discontinued from participation.  The Investigator can 
discontinue a subject at any time if medically necessary.  The Investigator may discontinue a subject’s participation if the subject has failed to follow study procedure s or to keep follow -up 
appointments.  Appropriate documentation in the subject’s study record and the study database regarding the reason for discontinuation must be completed.   
All subjects who fail to return to the study center for the Week 12/ET visit will be contacted by 
telephone to determine the reason(s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary visit or 
elected to discontinue from the study.  If a subject is unreachable by telephone after a minimum 
of two documented attempts ( one attempt o n two different days), a certified letter will be sent 
requesting that the subject contact the Investigator.  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   41

Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
Reasons for an Investigator’s with drawal of a subject may include , but are not limited to , the 
following:  
• Safety (e.g., severe adverse reactions , pregnancy ); 
• Lack of efficacy  as determined by the Investigator;   
• When the requirements of the protocol are not respected (e.g., significant issues with dosing 
compliance) ;  
• When a concomitant medication or treatment likely to interfere with the results of the study is reported, or required, by the subject (the Investigator will decide, in consultation with 
QST , whether the subject is to be withdrawn);  
• When a subject is lost to follow -up.  The Investigator will try twice to reach the subject by 
telephone and will send a certified follow -up letter before considering that the subject is 
lost-to-follow -up.  These actions will be reported on the subject’s study record  and a copy 
of the follow -up letter maintained in the Investigator's file.  
Refer to Section 6.7 for a discussion of criteria for discontinuation of individual subjects from 
the study.  
All pre mature discontinuations and their causes must be carefully documented by the 
Investigator on the subject’s study record  and in the study database.  In no case will a  subject 
who has been assigned a study number and randomized into the study be replaced by another.  
All Week 12 /ET evaluations should be performed at the time of premature discontinuation.  All 
data gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to QST and Novan.  
Study completion  or reason(s) for discontinuation as listed in the study record  will be  entered 
into the study database as follows:  
• Completed  
• Adverse Event  
• Lack of Efficacy   
• Withdrawal by Subject  
• Physician Decision   
• Protocol Violation  
• Lost to Follow -Up  
• Pregnancy   
• Worsening of condition 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   42 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
• Other  
Novan has the right to terminate or stop the study at any time.  Shou ld this be necessary, both 
QST  and the Investigator will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures are completed.  
4.2 EFFICACY A SSESSMENTS  
The same blinded evaluator  will perform Investi gator Global Assessments and lesion counting at 
Screening, Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  In the event that this is not possible due to 
unforeseen circumstances, a different blinded evaluator  will evaluate the subject.  However, the 
same evaluator sh ould evaluate subjects at the Baseline and Week 12 evaluations.  
4.2.1 INVESTIGATOR GLOBAL ASSESSMENT  
The Investigator’s Global Assessment Score will be a static assessment that is independent of the 
Baseline score.  The Investigator will make the assessment without referring to the Baseline 
value  and prior to performing lesion counts .  The assessment should be made approximately 
three feet from the subject.  The same investigator will perform each study assessment for each 
study subject, for consistency in evaluations.  
Subjects are eligible to participate in the study if they have a Baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate) 
or 4 (severe).  
 
The following scores will  be used to assign IGA scores:  
Grade  Description  
0 Clear: Clear skin with no inflammatory or non -inflammatory lesions . 
1 Almost clear: F ew non- inflammatory lesions with  no more than rare papules  
(papules may be resolving and hyperpigment ed, though not pi nk-red). 
2 Mild: S ome non- inflammatory lesions with no more than a few inflammatory 
lesions . 
3 Moderate:  Up to many non- inflammatory lesions and may have some inflammatory 
lesions, but no more than one nodular lesion . 
4 Severe:  Up to many non- inflammatory and inflammatory lesions , including nodular 
lesions  
 
4.2.2 LESION COUNTS  
The facial area lesion counts will be taken from the forehead, right and left cheeks, chin and 
nose.  The lesion count groups will be inflammatory and non- inflammatory.   Facial 
inflammatory lesions (pustules, papules, nodul es and cyst s) will be counted and recorded 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   43 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
separately.   Non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) will be counted and 
recorded separately.   The following are definitions of each lesion type:  
Inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:  
 
Papule  –A small, superficial, circumscribed, palpable lesion elevated above the skin surface, less 
than 10 mm in diameter  
Pustule  –A superficial elevated lesion that contains yellow fluid (pus) within or beneath the 
epidermis   
Nodule –A firm (indurated) lesion greater than 10 mm in diameter and that is thicker or deeper 
than the average papule  
Cyst  - Spherical swelling that contains fluid or semisolid material 
 Non-inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:  
 Open comedones  (blackhead) –Plugged follicular units with brown/black central debris  
Closed comedones  (whitehead) –Plugged follicular units with white central debris  
4.3 TOLERABILITY  ASSESSMENTS  
4.3.1 CUTANEOUS T OLERABILITY E VALUATIONS  
The Investigator will evaluate the subject’s face prior to  the first application of investigational 
product  in addition to evaluating  at each study visit.  The cutaneous tolerability assessment for 
visits other than Baseline should be performed at least 30 minutes after study drug application.  
Cutaneous tolerability evaluations will include erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus  and 
burning/stinging .  Pruritus and burning/stinging will be based on the subject’s report for the 
previous 24 hours.  Cutaneous tolerability endpoints will not be reported as an  AE unless they 
reach severe and/or result in subject’s discontinuation from the study .  Cutaneous tolerability 
assessments will be performed according to the following scales: 
Erythema  
Score  
Description  
0-None No evidence of erythema present  
1-Mild  Slight pink coloration 
2-Moderate  Definite redness  
3-Severe  Marked erythema, bright red to dusky dark red in color  
Scaling  
Score  Description  
0-None  No scaling  
1-Mild  Fine scales present to limited areas of the face,  barely perceptible

2-Moderate  Definite warm, burning/stinging sensation that is somewhat bothersome  
3-Severe  Hot, tingling/sensation that has caus ed definite discomfort and may have 
disturbed sleep  
4.4 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
4.4.1 ADVERSE E VENTS  
AEs will be collected starting after the subject has signed the informed consent and completed 
any study assessment until the end of the final study visit.  The date of o nset, date ended, 
severity, relationship to study drug, therapy required, and action taken regarding study drug and 
study participation will be reported for each AE.  
See Section 6 for additional information regarding the evaluation of adverse events.  
4.4.2 PHYS ICAL EXAM  
A brief physical exam will be performed at Screening, Baseline (Day 0) and Week 12 /ET.  If 
clinically significant changes i n the physical examination from Baseline are noted at the Week 
12/ET visit, these will be recorded as adverse events.   
4.4.3 VITAL SIGNS  
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be collected at Screening, Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 
12.  Any clinically significant changes in vital signs from Baseline will be recorded as adverse events whether or not drug related.  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   45

Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
4.4.4 LABORATORY A SSESSMENTS  
Chemistry, hematology, and PT/PTT will be collected at Screening, Baseline, and Week 12/ET.  
If clinically significant changes in lab results from Baseline are noted at the Week 12/ET visit, 
these will be recorded as adverse events.  Subjects wi th clinically significant anemia at Screening 
as determined by the Investigator will not be eligible to participate.  
4.4.5 METHEMOGLOBIN  
Methemoglobin will be measured at Screening, Baseline, Week 2 and Week 12/ET using a 
Masimo Rainbow® SET® Rad-57™ pulse co- oximeter that analyzes methemoglobin levels.  The 
percent methemoglobin will be displayed on the pulse co- oximeter and recorded in the subject’s 
study record and in the study database.   
Subjects with methemoglobin values of > 3.0% at Screening or Baseline will not be eligible to 
participate in the study.   
Clinically significant changes in methemoglobin will be recorded as adverse events.  The adverse event term should reflect the underlying diagnosis or symptoms and not the pulse co- oximeter 
result itself.  
Clinical symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia in relation to the level of methemoglobin are listed in Table 3 .

4.4.6 PREGNANCY TESTING  
All WOCBP must have a UPT at Screening and Baseline and if the  result is positive, the subject 
will not be allowed to participate in the study.  Refer to Section  6.4 for further information.  
A female is considered to be of childbearing potential UNLESS she is post -menopausal (no 
menses for 24  consecutive months), surgically sterilized, or without a uterus and/or both ovaries. 
Premenarchal  subjects will be considered to be of childbearing potentia l. 
Pregnancy tests will also be performed at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.  If a subject is determined to be 
pregnant prior to W eek 12, the subject will be discontinued from the study but followed until 
term.  
4.5 ADDITIONAL  ASSESSMENTS   
4.5.1 PHOTOGRAPHY  
Photographs of the face will be taken at Baseline  and Week 12/ET .  Baseline photographs may 
be reviewed by the sponsor or member of the study team to confirm appropriateness of enrolled 
subjects.   
4.6 SCREEN FAILURES  
A screen failure subject will be a person from whom inf ormed consent is obtained and is 
documented in writing (i.e., subject signs an informed consent form) but who does not meet the 
study eligibility requirements .  Subjects will not be allowed to rescreen .  
4.7 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for an emergency situation in 
which the protection, safety, and well -being of the subject requires immediate intervention, 
based on the judgment of the Investigator (or a responsible, appropriately trained professional 
designated by the Investigator).  In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to 
an emergency, accident, or mistake, the Investigator or de signee must contact QST at the earliest 
possible time by telephone.  QST will contact Novan for confi rmation on subject discontinuation 
decision prior to informing the site.  This will allow an early joint decision regarding the 
subject’s continuation in the study.  This decision will be documented by the Investigator and 
QST . 
5. PROHIBITED THERAPIES  AND MEDICATIONS  
Concomitant medications are any prescription or OTC  preparations.  Use of concomitant 
medications will be recorded on the c oncomitant  medications study record  and study database 
beginning at the Screening Visit until the f inal e valuation ( Week 12 /ET).  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   47 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
Subjects will be permitted to apply non-comedogenic moisturizer  or sunscreen  on an as -needed 
basis .  Moisturizer must not contain antibacterials and the subject must not change moisturi zer 
and/or sunscreen used during the course of the study.  If used, moisturizers  and sunscreen  must 
be applied at least 30 minutes after study drug application.  Use of facial cleanser, moisturizers , 
and sunscreen will be considered concomitant medication s; but these products will be recorded 
on a specific study reco rd for facial cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreen.  
Subjects must not have used anti -acne treatments including topical or systemic antibiotics or 
retinoids as described in Section 3.7.3 prior to Baseline.  These medications are also prohibited 
during the trial.   
Subjects may not be concurrently on nitroglycerin , drugs associated with methemoglobinemia , 
drugs associated with exacerbating acne vulgaris , or drugs/supplements that are nitric oxide 
releasers  (Appendix  1).  Subjects who have used an investigational drug or device within 30 days 
of Baseline  should not be enrolled.  Subjects must not participate in a different research study 
during the study period.   Any subject who has participated  in a previous study with SB204  
Gel/NVN1000 Gel  must not participate.  
Any medication/therapy used by the subject following first application of study product will be 
considered a concomitant medication/therapy (e.g., aspirin, acetaminophen , birth control pills, 
vitamins, soap, mois turizer, sunscreen, etc.) .  Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant 
medication/therapy dosing constant during the study .  Any change to concomitant 
medications/therapies should be noted on the subject’s study record  and in the study database.  
Whe n applicable, an AE should be completed for any subject starting a concomitant 
medication/therapy after enrollment into the study.  
6. EVALUATION OF ADVERS E EVENTS   
6.1 DEFINITIONS  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, dise ase, 
syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, injury  or 
accident)  whether or not considered drug related.  Any AE  that emerges or worsens following 
administration of the informed consent  and until the end of study  participation  will be collected .  
A pre -existing condition is one that is present prior to the start of the study and is to be reported 
as part of the subject’s medical history.  It should be reported as an AE only if the frequency, 
intensity, or the char acter of the condition worsens during the study.  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   48 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) includes any event , if in the view of either the investigator or 
QST Medical Monitor results in any of the following outcomes:  
•  Death 
•  Life-threatening  event  (i.e., the subject was, in the opini on of the Investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caus ed death if it were more severe.)  
•  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( i.e., the AE results in a substantial disruption 
of the subject’s abi lity to carry out normal life functions)  
•  Requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization ( i.e., the AE required at 
least a 24 -hour in- patient hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the 
expected length of stay; h ospitalizations for elective medical/surgical procedures, 
scheduled treatments, or routine check -ups are not SAEs by this criterion)  
•  Congenital anomaly/birth defect ( i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subj ect 
exposed to the molecule or i nvestigational product  before conception or during pr egnancy)  
•  Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above ( i.e., 
is a significant o r important medical event)   
  
6.1.1 ADVERSE  EVENT  SEVERITY GRADES  
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event.  
Severity will be categorized according to the following definitions: 
• Mild:  E vent may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does 
not require intervention 
• Moderate:  E vent may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance 
of daily activities may be influenced; intervention may be needed  
• Severe:  E vent may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject 
may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually needed  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   49 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
The Investigator will follow all subjects who experience AEs until there is a return to the 
subject’s baseline condition or until a clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved  or the subject 
is lost to follow -up. 
6.1.2 INVESTIGATIONAL P RODUCT  CAUSALITY 
Relationship of an AE to investigational product  will be assessed as follows:  
• Definite:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and the 
application of investigational product ; when the event responds to withdrawal of 
investigational product  and recurs with re -administration of investigational produc t. 
• Probable:   There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and the 
application of investigational product ; the AE is unlikely to be caused by the 
concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures . 
• Possible:  There may or  may not be a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset 
of the AE and the application of investigational product  and a cause cannot be ruled out . 
• Unlikely:  There is no reasonable temporal association between the test material and the 
suspected event and the event could have been produced by the subject's clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the Subject. 
• Unrelated:   This term should be reserved for those events that cannot be even remotely 
related to study participation.  
6.2 REPOR TING ADVERSE EVENTS  
For the purpose of AE reporting the trial period is defined as the period after the subject signs the 
informed consent /assent  to the end of subject’s last visit.   
The Investigator will assess subjects at each scheduled study visit for the occurrence of AEs.  In 
order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non- leading question:  
“How have you felt since your last visit?”  All AEs (serious and non- serious) reported by the 
subject must be recorded on the subject’s study record and entered into the study database.   
In addition, QST must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by telephone  or email  of any immediately reportable events  according to the procedure outlined 
below.  Special attention should be paid to recording hospitalizations and concomitant therapies 
and medications.  
6.3 IMMEDIATELY REPORTAB LE EVENT S 
Serious adverse events  (SAEs ) are considered immediately reportable event s.  Any SAE, 
whether deemed drug -related or not, must be reported to QST  by telephone  or email  as soon as 
possible after the investigator or coordinator has become aware of its occurrence.  The 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   50 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
investigator/coordinator must complete a Serious Adverse Event (SA E) Form and email  it to 
QST  along with the subject’s Adverse Events Log and Concomitant Medications Log within 24 
hours of notification  of the event.  When appropriate, Novan  will notify the appropriate 
regulatory body  of drug related Serious Adverse Event s. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Safety Contact Information:  
Email: safety@qstconsultations.com  
 
If a subject experiences a n SAE or pregnancy the  Investigator must :  
1. Report the SAE or pregnancy  by telephone  or email  immediately  (within 24  hours) after the 
Investigator becomes aware of the event . 
2. Complete a n SAE or Pregnancy Notification F orm and email  or overnight courier to QST  
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event .   
3. Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records, information and medical judgme nts of 
medical personnel who assisted in subject’s treatment and follow -up and document as 
appropriate . 
4. Provide a more detailed report to both QST  and the I RB, if applicable , no later than seven 
days after the Investigator discovers the event  as further information becomes available, 
and when necessary update the information with follow -up information including 
outcomes .  This report should include a statement as to whether the event was or was not 
related to  the use of investigational product . 
5. The Investigator will notify the I RB of the SAE or pregnancy according to specific I RB 
requirements . 
The Investigator will c ollect information on  SAEs until the subject’s health has returned to 
baseline status, until all parameters have returned to normal, or remaining health issues have 
otherwise been explained.   
6.4 PREGNANCY  
Women of child- bearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use an effective method of birth control 
during the course of the study  and for 30 days following their final study visit .  Allowable 
methods of birth control include stabilized on oral contraceptive for at least three months, IUD, 
condom with spermicide , diaphragm with spermicide, implant, Nuva Ring®, injection, 
transdermal patch or abstinence with a documented second acceptabl e method of birth control 
should the subject become sexually active .  Females taking hormonal contraceptives must have 
taken the same type for at least three months (90 days) prior to entering the study and must not 
change type during the study .  Those who have used birth control pills  or hormonal contraception 
in the past  and stopped must have discontinued usage at least three months prior to the start of 
the study.

A female is considered to be of childbearing potential unless  she is post -menopausal (no m enses 
for 24 consecutive months) , surgically sterilized,  or without a uterus and/or both ovaries.   
 
Male subjects must agree to avoid fathering a child during the study and for 60 days after the last 
dose of study drug by ensuring one of the acceptable me thods of contraception listed is used and 
by not donating sperm.  
Before enrolling any subject in this clinical trial, the Investigator must review guidelines about 
study participation  including the  topics below : 
• Informed consent document  
• Pregnancy prevent ion information 
• Risks to unborn child(ren)  
• Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, all subjects  must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during participation in this clinical study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy.  The subject must sign an informed consent document stating that the above -
mentioned risk fa ctors and the consequences were discussed.  
During the study, WOCBP  should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they 
suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle).  Male subjects should be 
instructed to contact th e investigator if their female partner becomes pregnant during the time the 
subject is enrolled through in the study through 60 days after the final visit.  The Investigator must immediately notify QST  of any female subject or the female partner of a male subject who 
becomes pregnant any time during study participation , record the information on the Pregnancy 
Notification Form and email the form t o QST .  Subjects found to be pregnant prior to Week 12 
will be discontinued from  the study.  QST  will ask the site to follow -up with the subject 
periodically  during  the pregnancy for ongoing health and safety information t hrough term,  as 
applicable.  Protocol -required procedures  for the Week 12 /ET evaluation must be performed for 
the subject.  
6.5 FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.5.1 FOLLOW -UP OF NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Non-serious AEs that are not resolved at the time of  the last scheduled study visit ( Week 12 /ET) 
must be recorded in the study database as  not recovered/not resolved.

6.5.2 FOLLOW -UP OF POST STUDY SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Serious adverse events that are identified on the last scheduled contact ( Week 12 /ET) must be 
recorded in the study database and reported to QST  according to the reporting procedures 
outlined in Sections 6.2 and 6.3.  This may include unresolved previously reported SAEs, or new 
SAEs.  The Investigator should follow these SAEs until the events are resolved, or the subject is 
lost to follow -up.  The Investigator should continue to report any significant follow -up 
informat ion to QST  and the I RB up to the point the event has been resolved.  Resolution means 
the subject has returned to the baseline state of health, or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition.   
Any new S AEs reported by the subject to the Investigator that occur after the last scheduled 
contact and are determined by the Investigator to be reasonably associated with the application of 
investigational product  should be reported to QST  and the I RB.   
6.6 OVERDOSAGE  
There is no specific antidote for nitric oxide.  I n the event of an overdose, best supportive care  
should be utilized.  Methylene blue may be used t o treat subjects exhibiting methe moglobinemia  
(Boylston, 2002).  
6.7 DISCONTINUATION OF I NDIVIDUAL S UBJECTS FROM THE STUDY  
Subjects who develop intolerance to the product as defined by scores of ‘severe’ (3) on 2 or more 
categories of tolerability (erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus, burning/stinging) shall be discontinued from the study.   
Subjects w ith > 5.0% methemoglobin at any post -baseline visit will be discontinued from the 
study.   
If a subject is determined to be pregnant prior to Week 12, the subject will be discontinued from the study but followed until term.  
7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
7.1 GENERAL C ONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 unless otherwise stated.  
Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -
values of ≤ 0.05 unless stated otherwise.  Inferential testing will compare each active treatment 
group to the combined Vehicle treatment group.  Comparisons will not be performed between 
active treatments.  Efficacy analyses will be performed for the intent -to-treat (ITT) and per -
protocol (PP) populations.  Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population.  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   53 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
For the dichotomized IGA, subjects will be considered a success if their IGA score is clear or 
almost clear and at least two  grades  less than Baseline.   
For those subjects for whom no Week 12 assessments are available, the last observation will be 
carried forward (LOCF) in order to provide a value for efficacy parameters that are missing, 
primarily due to missed visits.  Additionally, a sensitivity analy sis to estimate missing efficacy 
data will be based on estimation using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
independently for each treatment group.  All hypotheses will be two -sided at an alpha level of 
0.05. 
A detailed description of the statistical methodology and data repor ting for this study will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .  The SAP will be finalized before the database is 
locked and released to Novan.  Any deviations from the SAP will be justified in the clinical 
study  report.   
7.2 POPULATIONS  
7.2.1 INTENT TO TREAT (ITT) POPULATION  
The ITT population will include  all study subjects who were randomized and dispensed study 
medication.   
7.2.2 SAFETY POPULATION  
The safety population will include all  randomized subjects with documented use  of study 
medication (at least one  application)  and at least one post -baseline safety assessment .  
7.2.3 PER -PROTOCOL P OPULATION  
The PP population will include subjects who complete the Week 12 evaluation without 
noteworthy study protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have 
possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or  the precise evaluation 
of treatment efficacy).  The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria:  
• Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit, with the exception of a discontinuation from the study due 
to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented lack of treatment effect;  
• Have missed more than one  interim study visit; 
• Have not been compliant  with the dosing regimen (i.e. s ubjects must apply 80- 120% of the 
expected applications of study medication during participation in the study);  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   54 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
• Out of visit window at the Week 12 visit by ± 5 days;  
Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be add ed to the list to accommodate for 
unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study 
protocol violations. 
7.3 DEMOGRAPHIC AND BASE LINE CHARACTERISTICS  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summari zed by treatment group for the 
ITT, PP and safety populations .  For continuous variables (e.g. age), mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum will be presented.  Categorical variables (e.g., ethnicity, race) 
will be summarized with frequency c ount and percentage by treatment group.  
7.4 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTI CS 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the efficacy data at each evaluation for the ITT and PP 
populations.   Safety data will be summarized as indicated below for the safety population. 
Continuous data will be summarized with sample size (N), mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum.  Categorical data will be summarized with N, frequency counts, and 
percentages.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the active treatme nt groups, each vehicle treatment 
group, and the vehicle treatment groups combined.  
7.5 EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
Lesion counts will be summarized at each evaluation from Baseline through Week 12.  Absolute 
and percent change in lesion counts will be summarized at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  IGA scores 
will be summarized from Baseline through Week 12.  The dichotomized IGA scores will be 
summarized at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The analysis of the absolute change in non- inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12 will be 
conducted using an analysis of covariance with factor of treatment and baseline lesion count as 
the covariate.   
The analysis of the absolute change in inflammatory lesio n counts at Week 12 will use the same 
method as the analysis of the non- inflammatory lesions.  
The analysis of the dichotomized IGA scores at Week 12 will be analyzed with a Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Pairwise comparisons of each active treatment group to the combined vehicle treatment group 
will be computed without concern for controlling for multiplicity.

Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The analyses of percent change in inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12 
will use the same method as the analysis of the non- inflammatory lesions.  
 
The time to improvement will be compared between each of the active treatment groups and the 
combined Vehicle treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method.  An observation will be 
censored if improvement is not achieved by Week 12 (inclusive).  The log -rank test will be used 
to compare time to response between each active treatment group and the combined Vehicle 
treatment group.   
7.5.1 SENSITIVITY EFFICACY ANALYSES  
A sensitivity analysis will use the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple 
imputation to impute missing data for the non -inflammatory and inflammatory lesion counts and 
IGA at Week 12.  This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random.  
Additionally, the pattern of missing observations in each treatment group cannot influence the missing value estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group.  
 
Lesion Counts  
Multiple imp utation and subsequent analysis will involve four  distinct phases with these 
principal tasks:  
1. Calculate the number of missing values to be estimated by MCMC (nmiss) for 12 week 
value.  
2. Create a data set of subjects, one for each treatment group, with observed values and those 
needing estimation by MCMC. The missing lesion count values in each data set will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets.  The resulting data sets for each treatment group will be combined  into one complete data 
set for each imputation. 
Syntax:    
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5xnmiss;  
   where trtpn=(1, 2,, 3, 4, or 5); 
   mcmc chain=multiple; 
   var lescnt2- lescnt5; 
run; 
3. For each complete data set, the absolute change in non- inflammatory lesion counts and 
absolute change in inflammatory lesion counts for baseline minus the 12 week value will 
be computed.  Each complete data set will be analyzed as specified for the particular analysis.  
The results from these anal yses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC 
MIANALYZE.  
IGA 
The sensitivity analysis for the IGA multiple imputation will involve four  principal tasks:  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   56 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
1. Calculate the number of missing values, by treatment group, for IGA (total from 
Weeks 2,  4, 8, and 12).  
2. Missing values will be filled in `5 x nmiss` times to generate `5 x nmiss` complete data sets, where nmiss is the maximum number of missing values of both treatment groups.  The resulting imputed datasets for each treatment group will be co mbined 
into one complete dataset by imputation number.  
Syntax:    
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5 x nmiss;  
   where trtpn=(1, 2, 3, 4, or 5); 
   mcmc chain=multiple; 
   var IGA1 IGA2 IGA4 IGA8 IGA12; 
run;  
3. For each complete dataset, d ichotomous endpoints (defined as IGA = 0 or 1 and at 
least a two -grade reduction from Baseline) will be computed.  The imputed IGA 
values will be rounded to the nearest integer value prior to computing the 
dichotomized endpoints.  Each complete data set wi ll be analyzed with a Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS® PROC MIANALYZE.  
7.6 TOLERABILITY  
7.6.1 CUTANEOUS  TOLERABILITY  
Cutaneous tolerability assessments (erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus, burning/stinging) will 
be summarized from Baseline to Week 12 by treatment group.  
7.7 SAFETY  
7.7.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs that occur during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Treatment -emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study drug dose. Adverse events noted prior to the first study drug administration that worsen after Baseline will also be reported as AEs and included in the summaries.  
All information pertaining to an AE noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing verbatim term given by the PI or designee, preferred term, system organ class (SOC), onset date, resolution date, severity, seriousness, a ction taken, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event 
onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to date of first dose.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by treatment group, the number of subjects 
reporting a TEAE, SOC, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug (causality), and 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   57 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
seriousness.  When summarizing AEs by severity and relationship, each subject will be counted 
only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the event with the highest severity and g reatest relationship within each classification.  
Serious AEs will be summarized by treatment group, severity, and relationship to study drug, 
and individual SAEs will be listed by subject. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study due to an AE will be provided. 
7.7.2 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
Any clinically significant changes from Baseline will be documented as an AE.  
7.7.3  VITAL SIGNS  
Blood pressure and pulse will be summarized by treatment group from Baseline through Week 
12.  Additiona lly, change from Baseline in vital signs will be summarized at Week 2, 4, 8, and 
12. 
7.7.4 LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS  
Blood chemistry, hematology, and PT/PTT values will be reported individually at Screening, 
Baseline, and Week 12.  Laboratory test results will be s ummarized descriptively at Baseline and 
Week 12.  Additionally, shifts from Baseline to Week 12 in laboratory test results based on 
normal r anges will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  The last laboratory evaluation 
prior to the first dose of study drug will be used as Baseline for all laboratory analyses.  
7.7.5 METHEMOGLOBI N  
Methemoglobin will be reported as a percentage of hemoglobin.  Methemoglobin will be 
summarized descriptively by treatment group at Baseline and Weeks 2 and 12.  Additionally, the  
change from baseline in methemoglobin will be summarized by treatment group  at Weeks 2 and 
12. 
7.7.6 URINE PREGNANCY TEST S 
Urine pregnancy tests results for WOCBP will be presented in data listings by subject.    
7.8 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWE R CONSIDERATIONS  
Approximatel y 200 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 2:2:2: 1:1 ratio  (~ 50 in each 
active arm and ~25 in each vehicle arm ) at approximately 20 sites in North  America.  The main 
objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy , tolerability and safety  of SB204 with respect to 
vehicle.

8. INVESTIGATIONAL  PRODUCT  MANAGEMENT  
8.1 RECEIPT OF I NVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
Novan, or designee, will provide all investigational products  to the  study site s.   
8.2 STORAGE OF I NVESTIGATIONAL  PRODUCT  
Upon receipt from Novan , or Novan’s designee, a study staff member will place all study 
supplies  in a temperature -controlled area.  The pumps should be refrigerated ( 2-8 °C).  Access to 
study supplies  should be strictly limited to the study staff.  Neither the Investigator nor any 
member  of the study staff will distribute any of the study supplies  to any person not participating 
in this study.  
If a study staff member  becomes aware that the study supplies  have  not been properly handled 
(i.e., supply arrives and was not placed in refrigerator upon receipt), Novan  must  be contacted  
immediately.  In such an event, study supplies  should not be administered to any subject until 
Novan provides further direction. 
The investigational product  will be dispensed at the discretion and by  the direction of the 
Investigator in accordance with the conditions specified in this protocol.  It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that accurate records of investigational p roduct  issuance and return are 
maintained.  
It is expected that the site staff will maintain refrigerator temperature log s in the investigational 
product  storage area, recording the temperature at least once each working day.  Excursions in 
temperature duri ng storage should be discussed with QST personnel.  Other supplies will be 
stored at room temperature.  
8.3 TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT  AND B LINDING  
Subjects will be randomized to SB204 4% Gel, SB204 2%  Gel, or Vehicle Gel  on a 2:2:2: 1:1 
through utilization of the IWRS .  The e valuator  will be blinded to the subject’s treatment.   
8.4 UNBLINDING  OF TREATMENT ASSIGNM ENT  
In the event that a subject should experience an adverse event for which it is medically required 
to break the blind in order to determine appropriate tre atment, unblinding can be achieved by 
contacting t he QST Medical Monitor  who will arrange for the treatment assignment to be sent to 
the site by the unblinded IWRS administrator.  A study subject for whom the blind is broken will 
discontinue study product and will be scheduled for a follow up safety visit and be encouraged to 
stay in the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized.

8.5 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT ACCOUNTABILITY  
A trained study st aff member  will maintain an inventory of investigational product  components.  
This will include: 
• Dates and initials of person designated as responsible for the inventory of the 
investigational product  
• Amount received including date and lot number  
• Amount curren tly in refrigerat or, 2-8 °C storage  
• Pumps  dispensed to each subject, identified by subject initials and a unique subject number   
• Amount transferred to another location within the study site or destroyed  — this should not 
occur without prior  notificatio n to Novan  
• Non-study disposition (e.g., wasted, broken)  
• Amount returned to Novan  or designee , if applicable  
• Amount destroyed, if applicable  
All investigational product  accountability forms and treatment logs must be retained in the 
Investigator’s permanent study file.  These records must be available for inspection by Novan, 
QST, or their  designees or by regulatory agencies at any time.  
8.6 RETURNS AND DESTRUCT ION  
Upon completion or termination of the study, the site will be instructed on return or destruction 
of clinical supplies.   
9. RECORDS MANAGEMENT  
9.1 DATA COLLECTION  
The full details of procedures for data handling will be documented in the Data Management 
Plan.  
Source s tudy records will be collected for each study subject  and a study database will be 
maintained  for all study subject s.  Only status of informed consent and assent signature, gender , 
date of birth, ethnicity, race, and reason for failure will be entered in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system  for screen failures.    
Novan and QST  require  that the study database  be verifiable with the subject’s source study 
record .  This requirement necessitates access to all original recordings and other record s for each 
subject.  The Investigator must therefore agree to allow access to subjects’ records, and source 
data must be made available for all study data.  Subjects (or their legal representatives) must also 
allow access to the subject’s medical records.  Subjects will be informed of the importance of 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   60 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
increased record access and permission granted by signature on the informed consent document 
prior to any study procedures being performed . 
Before the study database is  formally submitted to Novan, the s tudy monitor, QST Medical 
Monitor or Novan  may request copies of the subject’s source study record  for preliminary 
medical review.   
The Investigator must keep written or electronic source document s for every subject participating 
in the clinical study.  These records must include :  
• Name 
• Contact information  
• Date of birth  
• Sex 
• Medical history  
• Concomitant diseases  
• Concomitant therapies/medication  
• Study visit dates  
• Performed examinations , evaluations, and clinical findings  
• Investigational product  admin istration  
• AEs, SAEs, or pregnancy  (as applicable)  
Additionally, any other documents with source data  must be included in the subject’s  source 
documents and must include the subject’s initials, study number  and the date of the evaluation.    
The data recorded during the course of the study will be documented in the study database.  
Subjects will authorize the use of their protected health information during the informed consent 
process  in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements .  Subjects who deny permission 
to use and disclose protected health information will not be eligible to participate in the study.  
The Investigator will ensure that the study records forwarded to QST, Novan or their designees , 
and any other documents, contain no mention of subject names.  
Any amendments and corrections necessary will be undertaken in both the study records and the study database.   
Regulatory authorities,  Investigational Review Board s, QST or Novan may request access to all 
study records  and other study documentation for on- site audit or inspection.  The Investigator 
must guarantee direct access to these documents.  The original set of study records will be kept 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   61 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
by the site or an authorized designee in a secured area.  Clinical data will be recorded in a n 
electronic format for subsequent statistical analyses.  Data files will be stored on electronic 
media with a final master data file kept by Novan  after descriptive and statistical analyses and 
reports have been generated and are complete.   
9.2 FILE MANAGEMENT AT THE STUDY SITE  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study center file is maintained in 
accordance with Section 8  – Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial  of the ICH 
Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance  and 21 CFR P art 312. 
9.3 RECORDS RETENTION AT  THE STUDY SITE  
It is a Novan  requirement that all Investigator s participating in clinical studies maintain detailed 
clinical data for one of the following periods , whichever is longest : 
• Country -specific requirements ; or 
• A period of at least two years following the last approval of a marketing application 
approved by a Regulatory Authority in an ICH region or until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region;  or, 
• A period of two years after Novan notifies the Investigator that the data will not be 
submitted for review by any Regulatory Authority . 
The Investigator must not dispose of any records or essential documents relevant t o this study 
without either (1) wri tten permission from Novan, or (2) providing an opportunity for Novan to 
collect such records.  The Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated during 
this study.  Such documentation is subject to inspection by Novan  and relevant regulatory 
agencies.  If the  Investigator withdraws from the study ( e.g., relocation, retirement),  all study -
related records should be  transferred to a mutually agreed -upon designee.  Notic e of such 
transfer will be provided to Novan in writing.   
10. MONITORING, COMPLIANCE, AND QUALITY 
All aspects of the study will be monitored by QST or Novan according to G ood Clinical 
Practices (GCP)  and Standard Operating Procedure s (SOPs) for compliance with applicable 
government regulations , (i.e., informed consent r egulations , (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999) , and 
Institutional Review Board regulations , (21 C.F.R. § 56.103, 1981) ).  Access to all records, both 
during the trial and after trial completion, should be made available to QST and Novan at any 
time for review and audit to ensure the integrity of the data.  The Investigator must notify QST  
immediately if the responsible IRB has been disqualified or if proceedings leading to 
disqualification have begun.   
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   62 
Protocol NI -AC202, Protocol Amendment 1   Version 2.0  
Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
The I nvestigator must conduct the protocol in accordance with applicable  GCP regulations and 
guidelines, applicable informed consent regulations  (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999) , and in 
compliance with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Every attempt must be made to 
follow the protocol and to obtain and record all data requested for each subject at the specified 
times.  If data is not recorded per protocol, the reason( s) must be clearly documented on the 
study records . 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at a meeting with the Investigator(s), a QST  or 
Novan representative will review the protocol and study records with the Investigator(s) and 
their staff.  During the study, the s tudy monitor will visit the site regularly to check the 
completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries into the study database , the adherence to 
the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment , to ensure that consent is being sought and 
obtained in compliance with applicable regulations , and that the investigational product  is being 
stored, dispensed and accounted for according to specifications.  The Investigator and key trial 
personnel must be available to assis t the monitor during these visits.  
The Investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospital or clinical records to confirm 
their consistency with the study database entries.  No information in these records about the 
identity of the subjects will leave the study center.  Monitoring standards require full verification 
for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs  and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables.  Additional 
checks of the consistency of the study records  with the study database will be performed 
according to the study -specific monitoring plan.  
The Investigator  or designee  must promptly enter the data into the study database after the 
subject’s visit.  T he monitor is responsible for reviewing them and clarifying and resolving any 
data queries.  A copy of the study records  will be retained by the Investigator who must ensure 
that it is stored in a secure place with other study documents, such as the protoc ol, the 
Investigator’s Brochure  and any protocol amendments. 
The I nvestigator must provide QST  and the responsible IRB with a study summary shortly after 
study completion.  
10.1 QUALITY ASSURANCE AUDITS AND QUALITY CONTROL  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, audits of clinical research activities in accordance with SOPs may be performed to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP.  A regulatory authority may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the study or even after its completion).  I f a regulatory authority requests an inspection, the Investigator must inform QST  
immediately that this request has been made.  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   63

Novan, Inc.    16 OCT 2014 
Study conduct may be assessed during the c ourse of the study by a  Quality Assurance 
representative(s) to ensure that the study is  conducted in compliance with the protocol  and GCP .  
He/she will be permitted to inspect the study documents (study protocol, study records , 
investigational product , original , study -relevant medical records).  All subject data will be treated 
confidentiall y.   
11. ETHICS AND RESPONSIB ILITY  
This study must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ICH Guidance for Industry 
E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance and the applicable regulatory requirements.  
The Investigator must submit all essent ial regulatory documentation, as required by local and 
national regulations  (including approval of the protocol and informed consent /assent form  by an 
IRB) to QST  before investigational product will be shipped to the study site .  The Investigator 
will review the final study r esults to confirm that to the best of his knowledge, it accurately 
describes the conduct and results of the study .   
12. CONFIDENTIALITY  
All information generated in this study must be considered highly confidenti al and must not be 
disclosed to any persons not directly concerned with the study without w ritten prior permission 
from Novan.  Authorized regulatory officials , QST  and Novan personnel (or their 
representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records.  All study 
investigational product s, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used 
solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agr eed to in writing by Novan . 
Subjects will only be identified by initials and unique subject numbers in the study database.   
13. AMENDMENT POLICY 
Only Novan may modify the protocol.  Amendments may be approved by all applicable national 
and local committees including, but not limited to, the government regulatory authorities and/or 
regional I RB before implementation.  The only exception is when an Investigator considers that 
a subject may be harmed and immediate action is necessary.  Under these circumstances, 
approval of the chairman of the I RB, or an authorized designee must be sought immediately.  
The Investigator should inform QST  and the full I RB no later  than five working days after the 
emergency occurs.  Protocol -specified safety reporting requirements must be adhered to 
independent of any other variables.  All amendments that have an impact on subject risk, the study objectives or that require revision of the informed consent document must be approved by the IRB before implementation.  Administrative changes to the protocol and/or changes that do 
not impact subject safety, risk  or comfort may be implemented prior to I RB approval if local 
institutional policy permits.  A copy of the written approval of the I RB, which becomes part of

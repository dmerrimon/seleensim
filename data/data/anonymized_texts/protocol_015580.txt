Number of Study 
Sites  Approximately 40 sites in the United States  (US)  will participate  in 
this study.  
Number of Subjects 
Planned The original planned sample size was  280 subjects randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to either the pimavanserin or the placebo treatment groups 
(i.e., 140 subjects in each treatment group).  The study was planned to 
be conducted in the US only. 
In March, 2020, in response to the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19), ACADIA implemented a temporary pause to new 
enrollment into study ACP -103-059, to decrease potential exposure to 
COVID -19, minimize risks  to trial integrity, and to assure the safety of 
already enrolled, ongoing study subjects. The last subject  was 
randomized on 17 March  2020, for a total of 148 randomized subjects. 
ACADIA decided to  combine its two ongoing, Phase III studies, 
ACP -103-059 ( US-based study) and ACP -103-054 (non- US), when 
each were  half enrolled, into one study with a pre -specified statistical

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 7 of 81 analysis plan. As a result, both studies closed  and are proceeding with 
database lock and statistical analysis. No new patients were enrolled 
into these studies. The last subject in Study ACP -103-054 was 
randomized on 17 March  2020, at which time  a total of 150 subjects 
had been randomized. 
The combined analysis  therefore comprises 298 randomized subjects. 
Test Product, Dose, 
and Administ ration Pimavanserin 34 mg (provided as 2×17 mg tablets) or matching 
placebo (2×placebo tablets [size- and color- matched to pimavanserin]) . 
It is recommended that the subject should take the study drug at 
approximately the same time each day. Tablets will be administered orally as a single dose once daily.  
Study Design  This study will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group study in subjects 
experiencing m ajor depressive disorder with inadequate response to a 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) or 
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ). 
This unmasked protocol version provides details of certain study design elements, procedures, and statistical methods that are intended for use only by the unmasked Sponsor and restricted Worldwide Clinical Trials personnel and their designated agents.  
The study will have three  periods ( Figure  S–1): 
• Screening period (3-28 days)  
• Double- blind treatment period ( 6 we eks) 
• Safety follow -up period (a t least  30 days) 
Screening Period (3 -28 Days) 
During the screening period, su bjects will be assessed for study 
eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued.  
Medications should be discontinued only if it is deem ed clinically 
appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of enrolling them into the study. The screening period may be extended up to 7 days to c onfirm subject eligibility when 
discussed  with the Medical Monitor in advance. 
Double -blind Period ( 6 Weeks)  
The Baseline visit (Visit 2) may occur as soon as screening procedures are completed and subject eligibility has been confirmed by the site  
and the Medical Monitor . At Visit 2, subjects will be randomized  in a 
1:1 ratio to pimavanseri n 34 mg  once daily or matching placebo. 
Assessments will be conducted at Week 0 (Baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and  
6/EOT or e arly termination (ET).

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 8 of 81 Safety Follow -up Period ( 30 Days ) 
Eligible subjects who successfully complete the 6 -week double-blind 
period will be qualified to enroll in an open- label extension study; 
subjects enrolling in the open- label extension study will not enter the 
30 day safety follow-up period. For subjects who discontinue 
prematurely from the study or who do not enroll in the open- label 
extension study, a safety follow- up telephone call visit will be 
conducted at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  
The schedule of assessments is provided in Table  S–1. 
Study  Duration  The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be up to 
15 weeks, consisting of a screening period of up to 5 weeks (i.e., 4 weeks, with possible extension of up to 7 days) , a 6- week 
double-blind treatment period, and a safety follow-up period of at least  
30 days (for those subjects who discontinue prematurely from the study or who do not enroll in the open- label extension study) 
(
Figure  S–1). The study completion date is defined as the date the final 
subject, across all sites, completes their final protocol-defined assessment, which includes the safety follow -up visit /contact , if 
applicable. If the study is terminated for any r eason , subjects 
remaining in the study will return to standard of care.

score. 
Adjusting for a potential non-evaluable rate of up to 5%, 
approximately 280 subjects will be randomized. 
Statistical Methods  Analysis Sets  
The Full Analysis Set includes all subjects who were randomized, received at least one dose of study drug, and have both a Baseline (Week 0) value and at least one post- Baseline value for the HAMD -17 
total score in the two  studies. The Full Analysis Set will be used for the 
analysis of all efficacy endpoints.  
The Per -protocol Analysis Set includes a subset of subjects in the Full 
Analysis Set without any protocol deviations that could have a significant effect on the study conclusions. The Per -protocol Analysis 
Set will be determined prior to unblinding the studies for the final analysis and will be used for supportive analysis of selected efficacy endpoints. 
The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug in the two studies.  
Any other analysis sets, if necessary, will be defined in the s tatistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will  be conducted on the combined database from 
the ACP -103- 054 and ACP -103-059 studies for the Full Analysis Set. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, change from Baseline to Week 5 in the 
HAMD-17 total score , will be analyzed  using a mixed -effect  model 
repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include effects for treatment group, visit, treatment- by-visit interaction,  baseline 
HAMD-17 total score, the baseline HAMD-17 total score- by-visit 
interaction , and study . An unstructured covariance matrix will be used 
and the Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to adjust the 
denominator degrees of freedom. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact 
of COVID -19. 
Each of t he secondary endpoints, other than response and remission , 
will be analyzed  using the MMRM method similar to that used for the 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint . For CGI -I, the baseline 
CGI-S score will be used as the covariate in the MMRM model. The 
response and remission rates will be compared between the pimavanserin and placebo groups using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) test stratified by study.

(primary and secondary).  
Safety Analyses  
Safety  analyses will be conducted on the combined database from the 
ACP -103- 054 and ACP -103-059 studies for the Safety Analysis Set . 
Safety results will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics. Adverse events (AEs) will be classified into standard 
terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA) . All AEs will be listed and TEAEs will be summarized by 
system organ class and preferred term.  A TEAE is defined as an AE 
that started after the first administration  of study drug and no later than 
the last administration of study drug plus 30 days . Summaries by 
maximum severity and by relationship  to study drug will also be 
provided. Serious TEAEs, fatal AEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation will also be summarized.  The relationship of selected 
AEs to COVID- 19 will also b e assessed and COVID -19 related 
TEAEs will be tabulated.  
Clinical laboratory values for hematology, chemistry and urinalysis (specific gravity and pH) will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics at Baseline  and the end of treatment visit. The 
change from baseline values will also be summarized by treatment group. The overall minimum and maximum post-baseline observed and change from baseline values will also be summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinica lly 
important (PC I) laboratory values at the end of treatment  and overall 
post-baseline will be summarized by treatment group for  selected 
parameters. The PC I criteria will be specified in the SAP . 
Vital signs including weight, height, and the derived BMI will be 
summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics at Baseline and each post- baseline visit. The change from baseline values will also 
be summarized by treatment group at the post- baseline visits.  
Observed values of ECG  parameters and the changes from Baseline 
will be summarized by treatment group  and visit. Categorical analyses 
will be conducted on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
For the C-SSRS, the number and percentage of subjects with suicidal 
ideation or suicidal behavior during the study will be tabulated. 
Observed values and change from Baseline in the ESRS- A score will 
be summarized by treatment group and visit. The change from 
Baseline in the ESRS -A score will be analyzed using the MMRM 
method, similar to the MMRM method used to analyze the primary endpoint.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACA DIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 19 of 81 a This visit is a safety follow -up telephone call visit for subjects who discontinue prematurely from the study or who  do not participate in the open- label  
extension study.  This vis it will occur at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  
b If visit was performed remotely  due to the COVID -19 pandemic , please refer to Section s 3.3.2  (remote clinical assessments ), 6.2.7  (efficacy assessments), 
6.3.8  (safety assessments) and 6.5.1  (unscheduled visits) for further information. 
c Inadequate response is defined as a response of <50% to a course of treatment of at least 8 weeks at the minimum effective dose (as listed on the ATRQ), 
which has been stable for the 4 weeks prior to the SAFER interview.  
d The SAFER remote interview may be conducted via telephone off-site or on -site. If conducted on -site, the site staff should not be present during the 
interview.  
e At Visit 1, ECG should be completed in triplicate  and collected within a 3 -minute period. At all other visits, a single 12 -lead ECG should be completed. 
ECG s should be completed with the subject in a supine position after 5 minutes of rest. The  ECG  should o ccur before blood sampling or at least 30 minutes 
after blood sampling.   
f To include hematology, serum chemistry, prolactin levels, and urinalysis . 
g A pregnancy test is only required for women of childbearing potential. Serum pregnancy should only be performed at Visit 1; a urine pregnancy test should 
be performed at  Baseline  and Week 6 (EOT). If urine cannot be obtained in women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test should be done in its 
place. 
h At Screen ing, blood samples will be collected for the analysis of concomitant SSRI/SNRI concentrations. The presence of SSRI or SNRI must be confirmed 
in order to qualify the subject for further consideration in the study . 
i The HAMD -17 is to be the first scale com pleted at each visit. 
j Suicidal assessment is required. The Baseline/Screening version of the C -SSRS will be administered at Screening . The Since Last Visit version of the 
C-SSRS will be administered at all subsequent visits.  
k At a minimum the safety ass essments indicated should be completed at unscheduled visits. Other assessments may be completed at unscheduled visits at the  
discretion of the Investigator.  
l Study drug may be dispensed to the subject at unscheduled visits if needed.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol and the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice s (GCP) Guideline.  
1.1 Background Information 
Depression is ranked as the leading cause of disability worldwide b y the World Health 
Organization ( Murray and Lopez 1996). In particular, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a 
psychiatric illness that is characterized by the occurrence of one or more major depressive episodes, along with an absence of any history of manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes. It is a serious, often recurrent medical condition, which is associated with a 15.9% lifetime risk of 
suicide attempt ( Chen and Dilsaver 1996). Results of the World Mental Health Survey 
Initiative found that the average lifetime incidence of DSM -4 major depressive episodes was 
14.6%, with a 12-month prevalence of 5.5% in higher income countries ( Bromet et al. 2011). 
Despite the availabilit y of numerous pharmacological and psychological treatment options, 
fewer than 50% of all patients with depression show full remission with optimized treatment, 
including courses on numerous medications with and without concurrent psychotherapy (Rush et al. 2006).  
Thus, while medications have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment patients  with an 
inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies, there is a clear need for efficacious  
medications with improved tolerability and safety. Current research continues to investigate 
novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of augmentation of antidepressant therapies . 
Pimavanserin was studied in a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-stage s equential parallel comparison design (SPCD) (Fava et al. 2016) study in adult 
subjects with MDD and an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy with concurrent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)/serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake  inhibitor 
(SNRI) (Study ACP -103-042). In the study, 207 adult patients with a confirmed inadequate 
response to existing first- line SSRI or SNRI therapy for MDD received adjunctive treatment 
of either 34 mg pimavanserin or placebo in addition to pre- existing first- line therapy for 
5 weeks  (Stage 1). Those patients who did not show a response to placebo in Stage 1 were 
re-randomized to receive either pimavanserin or placebo for a second 5- week treatment 
period (Stage 2). 
Pimavanserin met the overall primary endpoint of the prespecified weig hted average results 
of Stage 1 and Stage 2 by significantly reducing the 17- item Hamilton Depression Rating 
Scale (HAMD -17) total score compared to placebo (p=0.039). In addition, in Stage 1 (n=207) 
patients on pimavanserin demonstrated a highly significant improvement over placebo in 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 29 of 81 HAMD-17 (p=0.0003; effect size [Cohen’ s d] 0.626). Importantly, this group of patients saw 
a benefit over placebo in the first week of treatment (p=0.0365; effect size [Cohen’ s d] 
0.346). Fewer subjects (n=58) than anticipated proceeded to Stage 2, and no treatment benefit 
versus placebo was observed in this small set of placebo non-responders. In summary, pimavanserin met the overall primary endpoint of the prespecified weighted average results of Stage 1 and Stage 2 and demonstrated a highly significant improvement over placebo in 
HAMD-17 in Stage 1. 
On the key secondary endpoint, pimavanserin demonstrated statistically significant 
reductions compared to placebo in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) score (p=0.004).  
Positive  results were also observed for seven of the eleven  other secondary endpoints listed 
below with nominal p- values: Clinical Global Impression –Severity (p=0.0084), Clinical 
Global Impression –Improvement (p=0.0289), Short Form-12 Mental Component Summary 
(p<0 .0001), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (p=0.0205), Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual 
Functioning Index (p=0.0003), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (p=0.0075), as well as response 
rates (p=0.0065), defined as a 50% or greater reduction on the HAMD-17 total score.  
In this Phase 2 study, pimavanserin was generally well- tolerated. The most frequently 
reported treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included headache in the placebo group 
and headache, dry mouth, and nausea in the pimavanserin group. In Stage 1, for placebo subjects, TEAEs leading to discontinuation included depression, swelling face, and 
hypotension; for pimavanserin subjects, a TEAE of vomiting was reported and led to discontinuation. In Stage 2, a TEAE of diabetes mellitus was reported in the placebo group 
and led to discontinuation. One subject in each of the pimavanserin and placebo groups 
reported serious adverse events (SAEs). The placebo subject experienced SAEs of prostate cancer and calculus bladder; the pimavanserin subject experienced an SAE of acute myocardial infarction. These SAEs were deemed not to be related to the study drug by the 
Investigators and both subjects completed the study. No deaths were reported in the study. 
Furthermore, no meaningful differences were observed between the pimavanserin and placebo groups in changes in the Barnes Akathisia Scale, the Simpson Angus Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Weight changes and ECG changes between the 
pimavanserin and placebo groups were generally similar. In Stage 2, there was a mean QTcF 
interval change of 7.2 ms and -0.8 ms in the pimavanserin and placebo groups, respectively, 
which is consistent with what has been observed with pimavanserin in other clinical studies. 
On the basis of the robust preliminary clinica l evidence for efficacy and favorable tolerability 
observed in Study ACP-103-042, the present study is being initiated.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 30 of 81 1.2 Investigational Product 
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic  that is present  in the investigational product as  
pimavanserin tartrate salt with the chemical name, urea, N -[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]- N-(1-
methyl-4- piperidinyl) -N’-[[4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]methyl] -,(2R,3R)-2,3-
dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1). In April 2016, pimavanserin was approved in the United States 
(US) for the treatment  of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’ s disease 
psychosis (PDP). 
Pimavanserin is a novel small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic 
neurotransmission mediated by the 5- hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT [serotonin] ) 2A (5 -HT 2A) 
receptor . At higher doses, pimavanserin may block 5- HT 2C receptors ( Vanover et al. 2006). 
Pimavanserin  shows no appreciable activity at dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or 
muscarinic  receptors. Activity at these recep tors has been implicated in a range of dose-
limiting side effects associated with existing antipsychotic drugs including cognitive dulling (Saeedi et al. 2006 ; Mehta et al. 2004; Peretti et  al. 1997) and an increased risk of mortality 
in elderly patients with dementia ( Wang et al. 2005 ). On the basis of its novel receptor 
binding profile, pimavanserin may have benefits with  regard to overall tolerability relative to 
other antipsychotic agents. 
1.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved for the treatment of hallucinations 
and delusions associated with PDP. Studies have also been conducted in A lzheimer ’s disease 
psychosis (ADP), dementia -related psychosis and schizophrenia , and studies in Alzheimer ’s 
disease agitation and aggression, dementia -related psychosis , and schizophrenia are ongoing. 
A more complete discussion of these studies is available in the current pimavanserin Investigator’s brochure. 
Pimavanserin is considered to be generally well tolerated and has an acceptable safety 
profile . In single and multiple dose studies in healthy subjects , the highest doses administered 
were 255  mg and 136 mg /day, respectively. In Phase 1 studies in subjects who received 
pimavanserin without concomitant medication, the most common TEAEs (>3%) were 
postural dizziness (7.7%), headache (6.9%), somnolence (4.6%), nausea (3.8%), and 
dizziness (3.1%) in the single-dose studies (N=130) and headache (15.1%), dizziness (8.6%), 
nausea (7 .4%), somnolence (5.1%), and postural dizziness (3.7%) in the multiple-dose 
studies (N=350). Nausea and vomiting were considered dose- limiting. Pimavanserin doses 
≤34 mg generally had a low incidence of TEAEs, with only small differences versus placebo. 
In controlled studies of pimavanserin in subjects with PDP, the most frequent TEAEs 
experienced by subjects in the pimavanserin 34 mg group compared with the placebo group

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 31 of 81 were urinary tract infection (7.4% pimavanserin 34 mg vs. 6.9% placebo), nausea 
(6.9% pimavanserin 34 mg vs. 4.3% placebo), peripheral edema (6.9% pimavanserin 34 mg 
vs. 2.2% placebo), fall (6.4% pimavanserin 34 mg vs. 9.1% placebo), and confusional state 
(5.9% pimavanserin 34 mg vs. 2.6% placebo). In the long-term open-label studies in subjects with PDP  (as of 28 April 2019), the most frequent TEAEs include fall ( 31.1%), urinary tract 
infection (1 9.1%), hallucination (14.5%), decreased weight (1 3.3%), confusional state 
(11.4%), and constipation (11.2%). It is difficult to interpret these in cidence rates in the 
absence of a concurrent control group. The overall incidence of TEAEs appears within what would be expected in subjects with the underlying neurodegenerative disease, psychosis, and advanced age.  
As of 28 A pril 2019 , 74 subjects  have d ied during participation  in the PDP studies , with the 
majority of deaths considered not related or unlikely related to study drug. Five of these deaths occurred in 6 -week double -blind studies (1  subject received placebo, 1 subject received 8.5 mg 
pimavanse rin, and 3 subjects received  34 mg pimavanserin), and 69 deaths occurred in the 
multi- year, long -term open- label extension studies.  
Medical reviews of all deaths occurring in the pimavanserin PDP program, including placebo -controlled (6-week) and open- label (long -term) studies, found no common etiology 
or unifying pathology to attribute these deaths to pimavanserin treatment. The causes of death 
(e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, infection) were consistent with the advanced age, stage of 
illness, and comor bidities of this elderly, medically frail population. Additional information is 
provided in the current pimavanserin Investigator’ s brochure. 
In a frail, elderly population of 181 nursing home patients with ADP (90 treated with pimavanserin; 91 with placebo), pimavanserin was well tolerated, with no new safety observations. There were 8 post-randomization deaths, 4 (4.4%) in each treatment group. More subjects had SAEs with pimavanserin (15 subjects, 16.7%) than with placebo 
(10 subjects, 11.0%), but there were fewer discontinuations due to AEs with pimavanserin 
(8 subjects, 8.9%) than with placebo (11 subjects, 12.1%). TEAEs reported in ≥10% of 
subjects in either group were (pimavanserin; placebo) fall (23.3%; 23.1%), urinary tract 
infection (22.2%; 27.5%), agitation (21.1%; 14.3%), lower respiratory tract infection (14.4%; 
13.2%), contusion (12.2%; 15.4%), aggression (10.0%; 4.4%), anemia (10.0%; 8.8%), blood 
lactate dehydrogenase decreased (4.4%; 11.0%), and hyperglycemia (4.4%; 12.1%). Mean weight change from Baseline to Day 85 was comparable for the two treatment groups. Weight loss ≥7% was more common with pimavanserin (pimavanserin, 14.6%; placebo, 
1.8%). Treatment with pimavanserin had no negative effects on cognition or motor function. 
Pimavanserin increases QT interval. The magnitude of effect in humans has been assessed in 
a thorough QT study with doses of pimavanserin ranging from 17 to 68 mg and in the Phase  3

was observed. No clinically significant patterns have been observed in SAEs and there has 
been no evidence of pima vanserin -related laboratory abnormalities.

1.4 Study Rationale 
5-HT 2A serotonin receptors represent important targets for depression. A variety of studies 
have shown antidepressant activity from compounds with potent antagonist or inverse agonist activity at 5 -HT
2A receptors, and to varying degrees 5- HT 2C receptors, but low affinity to 
SERT, NET , and DAT, either alone or when coadministered with SSRI s (Table  1-1). These 
compounds include volinanserin, pruvanserin, ketanserin, ritanserin, mirtazapine, mianserin, and trazodone (Table 1-1 ). Pimavanserin, with its potent activity as a 5 -HT
2A 
antagonist/inverse agonist and lesser activity as a 5 -HT 2C antagonist/inverse agonist, has a 
similar receptor profile to many compounds with antidepressant activity. Therefore, although there are no preclinical data on pimavanserin in animal models of depression, it would also be expected to have antidepressant activity.

treatment of subjects with major depressive disorder who have had an inadequate response to 
antidepressant therapy.  
1.5 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
This study will examine a range of symptoms to explore the efficacy and safety  of adjunctive 
pimavanser in in the treatment of patients with MDD.  
Pimavanserin, with its potent activity as a 5 -HT 2A antagonist/inverse agonist and lesser 
activity as a 5 -HT 2C antagonist/inverse agonist, has a receptor profile similar to that of many 
compounds with antidepressant activity.  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase 2 study (ACP-103-042) exploring adjunctive pimavanserin, adult MDD patients with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy showed improvements in  measures of 
depression, disability , clinical global impression , sleepiness, and sexual functioning, as 
summarized in Section 1.1.  
Clinical studies conducted in a range of patient populations (approximately 2720 exposed 
subjects, including patients w ith PDP, ADP, Alzheimer ’s disease agitation and aggression, 
schizophrenia, and MDD, as well as healthy subjects) have shown that pimavanserin is 
generally well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile. In the Phase 2 study (ACP -103-042) no new safety signals were observed in the MDD patient population that 
were not already described in the approved NUPLAZID
® prescribing information 
(ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. 2019).  
On the basis of nonclinical and clinical data, it is therefore believed that pimavanserin has  
potential for benefit in the adjunctive treatment of MDD , with an acceptable safety profile. 
A more complete  assessment of the overall benefit/risk profile of pimavanserin  is provided in 
the current Investigator’ s Brochure.

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Overview of Study Design 
This study will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel -group study in subjects with MDD and inadequate response to antidepressant 
treatment. Approximately 40 sites  in the US  will participate in this study.  The duration of 
participation for individual study subjects will be up to 15 weeks.  
The study will have three periods ( Figure  S–1):  
• Screening period (3-28 days)  
• Double- blind treatment period (6 weeks)  
• Safety follow -up period (a t least  30 days) 
The study completion date (or when a subject is considered to have completed the study) is defined as the date the final subject, across all sites, completes their final protocol -defined 
assessmen t. Please note that this includes the safety follow-up visit/ contact, whichever is 
later. Procedures for when a subject is lost to follow-up are provided in Section  4.5. 
If the study is terminated for any reason , subjects remaining in the study will return to 
standard of care.  
3.1.1 Screening Period ( 3-28 Days) 
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued if medically appropriate. Subject e ligibility will be assessed 
by the site and the Sponsor through an eligibility review process. The screening period may be extended up to 7 days to confirm subject eligibility when discussed with and approved by the Medical Monitor in advance. 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 36 of 81 Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling them into the study. Medications should only be discontinued if it is deemed 
clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. 
3.1.2 Double -Blind Treatment Period ( 6 Weeks)  
The Baseline visit (Visit 2) may occur as soon as screening procedures are completed and 
subject eligibility has been confirmed  by the site and the Medical Monitor . At Visit 2, 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to pimavanserin 34 mg once daily or matching 
placebo. It is recommended that the subject should take the study drug at approximately the 
same time each day. Assessments will be conducted at Week s 0 (Baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 
6/EOT or early termination ( ET). 
3.1.3 Safety Follow- up Period ( 30 Days) 
Eligible subjects who successfully complete the 6 -week double-blind period will be qualified 
to enroll in an open-label extension study. For subjects who discontinue prematurely from the study or who do not enroll in the open- label extension study, a safety follow -up telephone 
call visit will be conducted at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 
3.2 Matching Study ACP -103-054 
Study ACP -103-059, conducted only in the US, is identical in design with Study ACP -103-
054, con ducted in parallel outside of the US . 
3.3 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Studies -059 and -054 
In March, 2020, the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in 
the implementation of measures  designed to ensure subject safety  in both studies. Screening 
and randomization of new subjects into studies ACP -103- 054 and ACP -103-059 were 
temporarily paused . All randomized subjects  that were ongoing in the studies at the time 
screening  was paused were allowed to complete as per protocol and enroll in the OLE 
provided that the subject, investigator and medical monitor agreed that it was  in the best 
interest of the subject  to do so, and the investigator could assure the site’s ability to properly 
monitor the safety and well-being of the study subject, in accordance to study protocol. 
3.3.1 Combination of Databases of Studies -059 and -054 
At the time screening  was paused , approximately half of the planned subjects had been 
randomized in each study. ACADIA decided to combine the two studies, ACP-103-059 and 
ACP-103-054, into one study with a pre- specified statistical analysis plan. As a result, both 
studies closed and are proceeding with database lock and statistical analysis. No new patients 
were enrolled into these studies. The modifications to the s tatistica l handling of the study are 
described briefly in Section 9 and in detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 37 of 81 3.3.2 Remote Clinic al Assessments  
In the interim between the pause in screening and the termination of the studies,  several 
subjects remained in the study who could not attend clinic visits . These subjects  were allowed 
to conduct remote visits via telephone or video, or site personnel could conduct the visit in a 
subject ’s home. Remote visits were not recommended for the Week 1 and Week 6 visits as 
these visits required EC Gs. Subjects were not allowed to roll over into the open- label 
extension study unless they came to the research site to conduct an in -person Week 6 visit.  
Sites were required to document details of all visits that were administered remotely.   
Further details about accommodations and modifications to assessments, relating to the COVID -19 pandemic, can be found in Section s 6.2.7 (efficacy assessments), 6.3.8 (safety 
assessments) and  6.5.1 (unscheduled visits) and Section 9 (additional sensitivity analyses) . 
3.3.3 Roll Over I nto Open- Label Study ACP -103-055  
Subjects may have rolled over into t he ACP -103-055 study (open-label extension) provided 
that the subject, Investigator and medical monitor agreed that it was  in the best interest of the 
patient , and the study site could assure its ability to properly monitor the safety and well -
being of the patient in accordance with the  study protocol .  
Additionally, all inclusion/exclusion criteria must have been verified  prior to rollover and the 
subject must have presented to the clinic in person to sign the ACP-103-055 informed consent form ( ICF) and ha ve all ACP -103-059 end of treatment procedures .

be made to follow the subject until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to 
be chronic or stable.  For subjects who continue to be followed for safety, SAEs  should 
continue to be reported as described in Section  7.4.2. All SAEs will continue to be followed 
until such events have resolved or t he Investigator deem s them to be chronic or stable. 
4.5 Subject Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow- up if they fail to attend a scheduled visit 
(including the safety follow-up visit) and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
Every reasonable effort should be made to contact the subject and will include a minimum of 
three documented phone calls (each performed at different times of the day) and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods. All 
contact attempts are to be documented in the source documents. 
4.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications used from study screening until completion of  the safety follow -up visit are 
to be recorded.  
4.6.1 Prior Medication  
Prior medica tion is defined as any medication taken before the date of the first dose of study 
drug. 4.6.2 Concomitant Medication  
Concomitant medication is defined as any medication taken on or after the date of the first 
dose of study drug. 
In order to ensure that appropri ate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Investigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment for a medical emergency).  
The Investigator may presc ribe appropriate medication to treat AEs. Relationship to 
COVID -19 will be assessed for selected medications.  The Sponsor and Investigator or 
designee will confer to determine whether it is appropriate to continue such a subject in the trial if a prohibite d medication is prescribed.  
4.6.2.1 Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medications  
Prohibitions and restrictions for concomitant medications should be followed between the 
initial screening visit and Visit 8/ET as specified in Appendix C  and Appendix D . These 
appendices do not constitute an exhaustive list and any questions regarding prohibited and restricted medications should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or desi gnee.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 44 of 81 Use of medications that could interfere with study conduct or any questions regarding 
prohibited and restricted concomitant medications should be reviewed and/or discussed with 
the Medical Monitor or designee. 
Medications that can prolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by the 
Medical Monitor) as specified in  Appendix C . 
Permitted concomitant medications should remain at a stable dose throughout the study .  
If a subject is on a medication restricted by the protocol, the medicatio n should be adjusted if 
it is determined by the Investigator to be clinically appropriate (e.g., if the subject’ s 
symptoms are not well-controlled or if the subject cannot tolerate the current medication) in consultation with the treating physician . 
Subjec ts who require current treatment with a prohibited medication will be withdrawn from 
the study. 
Subjects who have previously taken a prohibited medication during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study unless: 
• the prohibited medication has been disconti nued AND  
• withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The justification to allow the subjec t who has taken a prohibited medication to continue in 
the trial will be made by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor, with medical input fr om the 
Investigator, and will be documented. If a subject is allowed to remain in the trial, this will be 
reported as a major protocol deviation and not a waiver.

captured as protocol deviations. 
5.2 Investigational Product Accountability Procedures  
The Investigator or designee will keep current and accurate records of the study drug product 
dispensed, used, and returned for each subject to assure the regulatory authority and the Sponsor that the study drug is being handled appropriately. Subjects should be instructed to 
return all packaging and unused study drug to the Investigator at regularly scheduled clinic 
visits and ET visits. Any  study drug supplied is for use in this study only and should not be 
used for any other purpose. 
At appropriate intervals during the study, study drug reconciliation will be per formed by the 
Sponsor (or designee) who may return appropriate unused study drug and used and unused 
packaging to the Sponsor’ s designee for destruction.  
At the conclusion of the study, final study drug reconciliation will be conducted at the site. Final s tudy drug accountability documentation will be maintained at both the site and at the 
Sponsor. Any remaining unused study drug and all used and unused packaging will be sent 
back to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction, as allowed by country specific regulations. Documentation of study drug destruction will be recorded and maintained by both the Sponsor and the Sponsor’ s designee.  
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Study specific procedures are detailed below. All assessments will be completed according to the schedule described in  Table  S–1. Every effort should be made to complete the required 
procedures and evaluations at the designated visits and times.  
6.1 Screening  Assessments  
Subject eligibility will be assessed during the Screening period by the site and the Sponsor through an eligibility review process. The Screening period (between the Screening and 
Baseline visit) may  be extended by up to 7 days when awaiting results to confirm subject 
eligibility when discussed with the Medica l Monitor in advance. 
6.1.1 Medical History , Medication History, and Demographics 
A complete medical history  and medication history will be obtained from each potential 
subject. Demographic information, including date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity 
(if al lowed by local regulations) will be recorded as well. Any new medical condition 
beginning after the ICF has been signed will be captured as an AE. In addition, a history of 
the medications that the subject has taken for the current depressive episode should be

medication history.  
6.1.2 Psychiatric History  
Details of the subject ’s psychiatric history and treatment will be collected.  
6.1.3 Background Antidepressant Blood Level  
At Screening, blood samples for the analysis of the concomitant selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants will be collected. At Screening, the presence of SSRI or SNRI must be confirmed in order to qualify 
the subject for further consideration in the study. Review of subject adherence with 
background antidepressant therapy should be conducted at screening visit and all visits.  
6.1.4 Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response  
Questionnaire  
The MGH ATRQ ( Fava and Davidson 1996; Fava 2003) is a clinician -assisted questionnaire 
that examines a patient ’s antidepressant treatment history using specific anchor points to 
define the adequacy of both the dose and duration of each antidepressant course, as well as 
the degree of symptomatic improvement obtained with each course. This validated questionnaire allows for the determination of inadequate response to antidepressant therapy in MDD ( Chandler et al. 2010). Inadequate response is d efined as a response of <50% to a 
course of treatment of at least 8 weeks at the minimum effective dose (as listed on the ATRQ), which has been stable for the 4 weeks prior to the SAFER interview.  
6.1.5 State versus trait, Assessability, Face validity, Ecological validity, and Rule of 
three Ps (pervasive, persistent, and pathological) (SAFER) Remote Interview  
To ensure that appropriate subjects are entered into the study, an interview will be conducted 
. 
The interview may be conducted via telephone off-site or on-site, during Screening. If 
conducted on-site, the site staff should not be present during the interview. The assessments administered will be the SAFER Interview, which will include the MADRS, the CGI -S, and 
the MGH ATRQ. Sites will be notified of the results within 24 hours of the interview. 
6.1.6 Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview  
The MINI is  a brief, structured , diagnostic interview covering a broad range of ma jor 
psychiatric disorders in DSM -5 and ICD-10 ( Sheehan et al. 1998). The MINI is divided into 
modules, with each module corresponding to a diagnostic category. After completing the 
questions in each module, t he interviewer (i.e., the Investigator or designee) assesses whether 
the diagnostic criteria are met.  

Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 48 of 81 In addition, one module for depressive disorders from the MINI-Plus will be used in 
conjunction with the MINI. The MINI-Plus is a more extensive version of the MINI, 
inclu ding additional disorders and disorder subtyping (Sheehan et al. 1998). 
MINI Version 7.0.2 for DSM-5 will be used in this study and will be conducted during Screening.  
6.1.7 Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale 
The MADRS ( Montgomery and Asberg 1979) is a 10 -item, clinician -rated instrument 
measuring depression severity. It will be administered  during Screening and at Baseline by 
the Investigator or designee with a Structured I nterview Guide for the Montgomery- Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale (SIGMA) ( Williams and Kobak 2008) . The timeframe for this scale 
is the past 7 days. 
6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1 Hamilton  Depression  Scale (17 Items)  
The HAMD-17 ( Hamilton 1960) is completed with the Structured Interview Guide for the 
Hamilton Depr ession Rating Scale (SIGH -D) (Williams 1988 ) by the Investigator or designee 
based on an assessment of a patient ’s symptoms . The timeframe for this scale is the past 
7 days. The HAMD- 17 is to be the first scale completed at each v isit. The HAMD -17 will be 
used as the primary efficacy analysis.  
The anxiety/somatization factor  of the HAMD -17 ( Cleary and Guy  1977) includes six items: 
psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic 
symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight, and will be used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.2 Sheehan Disability Scale  
The SDS ( Sheehan et al. 1996) is a three -item patient-facing questionnaire used to evaluate 
impairments in the domains of work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility. 
All items are rated on an 11 -point continuum (0=no impairment to 10=most severe). The 
timeframe for this scale is the past week . The SDS will be used for secondary efficacy 
analyses.  
6.2.3 Clinical Global Impression –Severity and Clinical Global Impression –
Improvement Scales  
The CGI -S and CGI- I (Guy 1976) are scales used by the Investigator or designee to rate the 
severity of the disorder and the global improvement since beginning of the study. The CGI- S 
rates the severity of a patient ’s depression over the past 7 days and will be completed with a 
structured interview guide for global impressions (SIGGI) ( Targum et al. 2013). The CGI -S 
will be used for secondary efficacy analyses. The CGI -I rates the change in a patient ’s

used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.4 Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short Form  
Sexual functioning will be assessed using the CSFQ -14 ( Keller et al. 2006) , a 14 -item version 
of the CSFQ ( Clayton et al. 1997) . This is a patient-facing questionnaire, with a male version 
and a female version,  that provides scores for three scales corresponding to the phases of the 
sexual response cycle (i.e. , desire, arousal, and orgasm) and the five scales of the original 
CSFQ (sexual desire, sexual frequency, sexual satisfaction, sexual arousal, and sexual 
completion). The CSFQ -14 will be used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.5 Karolinska Sleepiness Scale  
The KSS (Akerstedt and Gill berg 1990 ) is a patient -facing scale that measures the patient ’s 
drowsiness and is frequently used in studies measuring subjective sleepiness. Scoring is 
based on a 9-point verbally anchored scale ranging from “ extremely alert” to “very sleepy, 
great effort to keep awak e, fighting sleep. ” The timeframe for this scale is the past 7 days.  
The KSS will be used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.6 Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 
The BIS -11 (Patton et al. 1995) is a questionnaire designed to asse ss the 
personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. It is composed of 30 items describing 
common impulsive or non-impulsive (for reverse scored items) behaviors and preferences. Items are scored on the following 4- point scale: Rarely/Never=1; Occasionally=2; Often=3; 
Almost Always/Always=4.  The BIS -11 will be used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.7 Impact of COVID- 19 Pandemic on Efficacy Assessments  
In the interim between the pause in screening  and the termination of the studies due to the 
COVID -19 pand emic , several subjects remained in the study who could not attend clinic 
visits. These subjects were allowed  to participate in  remote visits via telephone or video, or 
site staff could have visited subjects in their homes .  
6.3 Safety Assessments 
6.3.1 Physical Examinations 
A general physical examination will be conducted  at Screening, Baseline, and Week 6/ET . 
6.3.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include body temperature, resting respiration rate, sitting systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate. The sitting blood pressure should be measured after 
the subject has been sitting for ≥ 3 minutes.  
Vital signs will be measured at all scheduled  and unscheduled visits.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 50 of 81 6.3.3 Height , Weight, and Body Mass Index  
Height will be measured at Screening . 
Weight will be measured at all scheduled and unscheduled visits. 
Body m ass index will be calculated using the following formula: 
Weight (kg) / [height (m)]2. 
6.3.4 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be complete, standardized recordings. At Visit 1 (Screening), the ECG 
should be completed in triplicate and collected within a 3-minute period. At all other visits, a 
single 12- lead ECG should be completed. All ECGs will be centrally read; the interpretation 
by the central cardiologist is considered the official result . 
At Visit 1 (Screening) the mean QTcF/QRS values of all the tracings of adequate quality will 
be used to determine eligibility. If a site performs additional ECGs beyond the set of triplicate 
ECGs prescribed at Screening or the single ECG prescribed at Baseline, the mean QTcF/QRS 
values of all the tracings of adequate quality will be used to dete rmine eligibility.  
• At Screening, if the set of triplicate ECGs has a prolonged QTcF due to an identifiable 
cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat set of triplicate ECGs may be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical Monitor if 
time permits during the Screening period.  
• At Baseline, a subject who met the eligibility criteria during the central read  of the 
screening ECGs may be enrolled based on the machine read of the locally completed ECG. If the interpreta tion of the ECG by the central cardiologist returned after 
randomization indicates QTcF outside of the allowable range, the subject will be discontinued from the study, but this will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
Electrocardiograms should be performed before blood sampling or at least 30 minutes after blood sampling. The subject must rest in a supine position for 5 minutes before the ECG is 
obtained. ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified 
clinician. ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, and QTcB intervals) will be included and summarized in the subject’ s study records.  
6.3.5 Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011). The following four constructs are measured: the severity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality. 
The Baseline/Screening version will be administered at V isit 1 (Screening), and the Since 
Last Visit version will be administered at all subsequent visits, including unscheduled visits. 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 51 of 81 The C -SSRS results for each subject should be reviewed by the Investigator at each visit. If at 
any time the C -SSRS results fo r a given subject reveal potential suicidality, then the 
Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a clinically significant 
risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the Investigator should discontinue the subject  and implement appropriate treatment ( Section  4.4).  
6.3.6 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale–Abbreviated  
The ESRS ( Chouinard and Margolese 2005 ) was developed to assess drug induced 
movement disorders such as parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and tardive dyskinesia with established reliability, validity, and sensitivity. It consists of a questionnaire of parkinsonian symptoms, physician examination of parkinsonism, dyskinetic movements, and global impression of tardive dyskinesia. The ESRS-A, an accepted modified form of the original 
ESRS, will be used during the study to monitor for any worsening in extrapyramidal symptoms or signs at scheduled and unscheduled visits.  
6.3.7 Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory sample collection (including HbA
1c at Screening only) is encouraged, but 
not required to be completed under fasting conditions. The laboratory evaluations will 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Clinical chemistry serum tests  
o Sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), 
magnesium (Mg), carbon dioxide (CO 2), blood urea nitrogen (BUN),

(drug) screen  performed by the central laboratory and who have a valid 
prescription may be retested during Screening if they agree to abstain from the medication for the length of their participation in the study and if abstinence from medication usage is achieved at least 7 days prior to Visit 2 (Baseline). The repeat test  during Screening must be negative for them to participate in 
the study. Additionally, DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorders should not be met.  
o Subjects who test positive in the urine toxicity (drug) screen performed by the 
central laboratory for ben zodiazepines, tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ), or 
opiates will be withdrawn from the study unless any prohibited medication or substance has been discontinued and withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk for the subject. The justification  to allow the subject 
to continue in the trial will be made by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor, with 
medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. If a subject is 
allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol deviatio n, not a waiver. In addition, restrictions listed in Appendix C  should be 
followed.

6.3.8 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Safety Assessments 
In the interim between the pause in screening  and the termination of the studies due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic, several subjects remained in the study who could not attend clinic

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 54 of 81 visits. These subjects were allowed to conduct remote visits via telephone or video, or site 
staff could have visited subjects in their homes.  
Some safety assessments may not have been performed, or may have been performed under 
different circumstances, due to the subject not being able to come to the clinic. Modifications and accommodations for safety assessments in the context of remote visits are described briefly below:  
6.3.8.1 Priority Medical Ass essments in Remote Visits 
The C -SSRS was to be performed as a priority, along with an assessment of AEs and 
COVID -19 symptoms. Additionally, subjects were to be queried about concomitant 
medications, and their background antidepressant and IP compliance. 6.3.8.2 Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, Height, and Weight 
Physical examinations, vitals, height, and weight may not have been performed because the 
visit had to be conducted remotely. I f the visit was  remote, subject may have  report ed vitals 
obtained on home devices.   
6.3.8.3 Electrocardiograms  
ECGs may have been performed by site staff during a home visit.  
6.3.8.4 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
See Section 6.3.8.1 above.  
6.3.8.5 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale- Abbreviated  
When the ESRS-A motor examination could not be performed (e.g., when the visit was  
performed via telephone with no video component) then no scoring of symptoms was to  be 
completed . The clinical interview questions were to be asked for all symptom areas in ord er 
to obtain information about the presence and severity of involuntary movements experienced 
by the patient and this was to be documented in the source record. The clinical significance of any symptoms was  to be evaluated by the investigator and the adver se event page updated 
when new or worsening symptoms were reported. 
6.3.8.6 Laboratory Evaluations 
If subjects could not attend clinic visits for laboratory evaluations, they were allowed to use 
local laboratories, or to have site staff visit them at their homes f or blood draws. 
6.4 Safety Follow- up 
A 30-day safety follow -up telephone contact is to be completed for subjects who complete 
the treatment period of the study  and decide not to continue into the open- label study or are

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 55 of 81 not eligible for the open-label study, as well as those who discontinue prematurely from the 
study. Subjects should have the following completed at least 30 days  after last dose of study 
drug: 
• Assessment of concomitant medications/treatments  
• Assessment of AEs  
6.5 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur as determined by the Investigator. The following safety assessments generally should be recorded at each unscheduled visit: assessment of AEs, 
assessment of concomitant medications/treatments, measurement of vital signs  and weight, 
ESRS -A, and completion of the C- SSRS (Since Last Visit version) . The Investigator may 
perform any additional safety evaluations deemed by the Investigator to be clinically indicated.  Study drug may be dispensed to the subject at unscheduled visits if needed. 
6.5.1 Impact of COVID- 19 on Unscheduled Visits  
If subjects were not able to attend the clinic for an unscheduled visit, this may have occurred 
remotely or by site staff visit to the subject ’s home. 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “ any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study 
participant, temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug ”. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g.,  off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are 
present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 56 of 81 • Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
Baseline.  
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the subject 
is hospitalized for observation 
• Hospitalization for elective surgery planned prior to study (situation where an untoward medica l occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a pregnancy form  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by the Investigator as “ serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousness of an event will be  defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following: 
• Is fatal 
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Resu lts in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospitalization  
• Prolongs existing hospitalization  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life -threatening event places the subject  at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
Definition of Hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined by the Sponsor as a full admission to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment . This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient  hospitalization . 
 
Examples of visits to a hospital facility that do not  meet the serious criteria for 
hospitalization include: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospital admission ) 
• Outp atient surgery  
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 57 of 81 • Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospitalization, defined as admission to the hospital as a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject ’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage 
Disability is defined as a  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or M edical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1 Severity of Event 
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF: 
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe: incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “ related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related  if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by the product under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider t he following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 58 of 81 • Response to cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge  
• Compat ibility with known class effect  
• Known effects of concomitant medications 
• Pre-existing risk factors  
• A pla usible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
7.2.2.1 Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first episode of the AE or date of significant sustained worsening in 
severity  
• Stop: Date when AE either ceased permanently or changed in severity  
7.2.2.2 Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions: 
• Single : Experienced once, without recurrence  
• Recurrent : More than one discrete episode with the same severity  
7.2.2.3 Action Taken wi th Study Drug  
• Dose not changed : No change in study drug  
• Drug interrupted : Study drug temporarily  stopped 
• Drug withdrawn: Study drug discontinued permanently  
7.2.2.4 Therapy  
• None : No new treatment instituted  
• Medication : New treatment initiated  as a direct result of  AE 
• Other: Other action required  
7.2.2.5 Outcome  
• Recovered/resolved : Recovered or resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Recovered  or resolved with sequelae  
• Not recovered/not resolved : Not recovered or not resolved 
• Fatal : Death due to an AE  
• Unknown: Unknown

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 59 of 81 7.2.2.6 Seriousness  
• Not serious  
• Serious  
7.2.3 Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severity of w hich is not consistent with the information  provided in the 
Reference Safety Info rmation section of the current pimavanserin Investigator ’s brochure.  
7.3 Time Period a nd Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
Adverse events  will be recorded from the time informed consent is  obtained through the 
study safety follow-up period. All AEs must be either resolved or stable at the end of the 
study safety follow -up period. If ongoing at the end of the study safety follow -up period, the 
subject should be referred for appropriate treatment. 
In the event that a subject discontinues and has an ongoing AE at the time of discontinuation 
(Section  4.4.1) or is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the subject should be 
followed and treated by the Investigator until the AE has resolved, stabilized, or a new 
chronic baseline has been established. 
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
7.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator must re cord all observed AEs and all reported AEs . At each visit, the 
Investigator should ask the subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit? ”) to assess whether any AEs have been  experienced since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on both the AE and the concomitant medication  page.  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology. Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by the 
Investigator. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms 
(e.g.,  “cold” or “ seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose ”). 
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes. 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 60 of 81 7.4.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of SAEs by the Sponsor or designee to the regulatory a uthorities is a regulatory 
requirement . Each regulatory a uthority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs ba sed 
upon established criteria. 
Serious AEs must be reported within 24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee; use 
the appropriate form for initial and/or follow-up reporting.  
At a minimum, events identified by the Sponsor to require expedited reporting as serious, 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible 
institutional r eview board/e thics c ommittee ( IRB/ EC), as per applicable regulations. These 
will be provided by the Sponsor after their assessment. For European Union member states, the Sponsor or its designee wil l provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions  (SUSARs ) directly to the ECs, as required by local legislation . In all other 
countries, it is the Investigator ’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the 
responsible IRB/ EC. It is also the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the responsible 
IRB/ EC regarding any new and significant safety information.  
When an SAE occurs, Investigators will review all documentation related to the event and will complete the paper SAE form (for initial and/or follow -up information) and fax or email 
(within 24 hours of discovery) to the contact information provided on the SAE form. 
Subjects will be followed through the safety follow-up period for 30 days after last dose of 
study drug for any SAEs and/or other reportable information until such events have resolved 
or the Investigator, in conjunction with the Sponsor, deems them to be chronic or stable. 
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact t he 
Investigator (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by the Investigator or designee as soon as is feasible following the report of the SAE. 
Serious AEs occurring after the study follow-up p eriod  of 30 days after last dose of study 
drug should be reported if in the judgment of the Investigator there is “ a reasonable 
possibility ” that the event may have been caused by the pr oduct. 
SAEs should also be reported to the IRB /EC according to local regulations.  
7.4.3 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs)  must be 
withdrawn from the study and the pregnancy must be reported on the Pregnancy form within 
24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee. Any female subject  who becomes 
pregnant during the study will be followed through the pregnancy outcome.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 61 of 81 Any AEs that are the consequence of pregnancy and which meet the criteria for serious 
should also be reported via the SAE form. 
7.4.3.1 Reporting  Paternal Drug Exposure 
Paternal drug exposure is defined as a father ’s exposure to a medicinal product before or 
during his partner’s pregnancy. Any paternal drug exposure cases must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery via the Pregnanc y form. Any AEs that are the 
consequence of paternal drug exposure and which meet the criteria for serious must also be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery via the SAE form. 
7.4.4 Reporting of Overdose 
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported to the Sponsor or 
designee on the Overdose form within 24 hours of discovery. In addition, all events of 
overdose are to be captured as protocol deviations. 
8 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Routine monitoring of study sites is described in Section  11. 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well-being of human 
subjects are protected, that the reported  study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and 
that the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and amendment(s) as applicable, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements. Details 
of the study site mon itoring process are described in a separate cli nical monitoring plan 
document. 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan (SAP ) to be 
approved by th e Sponsor prior to database lock. 
9.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The hypotheses for the primary endpoint are the following: 
• The null hypothesis: There is no difference in the mean change from Baseline to 
Week  5 in the HAMD- 17 total score between the pimavanserin and the placebo 
treatment groups.  
• The alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in the mean change from Baseline to 
Week 5 in the HAMD- 17 total score between the pimavanserin and the placebo 
treatment groups.  
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 62 of 81 9.3 Sample Size Determination  
This study plans to screen approximately 560 adult  subjects to randomize approximately 
280 subjects, allowing for a 50% screen failure rate. These approximately 280 subjects will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the pimavanserin or the placebo treatment groups (i.e., 140 subjects in each treatment group).  
A total sample size of 266 evaluable subjects was estimated to provide at least 90% power at 
a two -sided significance level of 0.05 when assuming a treatment effect size of 0.4 for 
pimavanserin compared to placebo on the change from Baseline to Week 5 in the HAMD-17 
total score . Adjusting for a potential non-evaluable rate of up to 5%, approximately 
280 subjects will be randomized.  
9.4 Subject Populations for Analysis  
The Full Analysis Set includes all subjects who were ra ndomized, received at least one dose 
of study drug, and have both a Baseline (Week 0) value and at least one post- Baseline value 
for the HAMD -17 total score in the two  studies. The Full Analysis Set will be used for the 
analysis of all efficacy endpoints.  
The Per -protocol Analysis Set includes a subset of subjects in the Full Analysis Set without 
any protocol deviations that could have a significant effect on the study conclusions. The 
Per-protocol Analysis Set will be determined prior to unblinding the studies for the final 
analysis and will be used for supportive analysis of selected efficacy endpoints. 
The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug in 
the two  studies.  
Any other analysis sets, if necessary, will  be defined in the SAP. 
9.5 Statistical Analyses 
9.5.1 Primary  Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint, change from Baseline to Week 5 in the HAMD-17 total score, 
will be evaluated using a mixed -effect model repeated measures (MMRM). The model will 
include effects fo r treatment group, visit, treatment- by-visit interaction, baseline HAMD -17 
total score, the baseline HAMD -17 total score- by-visit interaction , and study . An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be used and the Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to adjust 
the denominator degrees of freedom. 
A hierarchical approach will be used to control for multiple endpoints (primary and 
secondary).  Details will be provided in the SAP.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 63 of 81 Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of missing data, includ ing 
analyses based on a missing not at random assumption. Additional sensitivity analyses will be 
performed to assess the impact of COVID -19.   
9.5.2 Secondary Analyses 
Each of t he secondary endpoints, other than response and remission, will be analyzed using 
the MMRM method similar  to that used for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. For 
CGI-I, the baseline CGI -S score will be used as the covariate in the MMRM model. The 
response and remission rate s will be compared between the pimavanserin and placeb o groups 
using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by study . 
9.5.3 Safety Analyses 
Safety results will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Adverse 
events will be classified into standard terminology using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All AEs will be listed and treatment- emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term. A TEAE is 
defined as an AE that started after the first administration of study dru g and no later than the 
last administration of study drug plus 30 days. Summaries by maximum severity and by 
relationship to study drug will also be provided. Serious TEAEs, fatal AEs, and TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation will also be summarized.  The relat ionship of selected AEs to 
COVID -19 will also be assessed and COVID- 19 related TEAEs will be tabulated.  
Clinical laboratory values for hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis (specific gravity and pH) 
will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics at Baseline  and the end of 
the treatment period  visits. The change from baseline values will also be summarized by 
treatment group. The overall minimum and maximum post-baseline observed and change from baseline values will also be summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically important (PCI) laboratory 
values at the end of the treatment period  and overall post- baseline will be summarized by 
treatment group for selected parameters. The PCI criteria will be specified  in the SAP. 
Vital signs including weight, height, and the derived BMI will be summarized by treatment 
group using descriptive statistics at Baseline and each post-baseline visit. The change from baseline values will also be summarized by treatment group a t the post- baseline visits.  
Observed values of electrocardiogram parameters and the changes from Baseline will be 
summarized by treatment group and visit.  Categorical analyses will be conducted on the 
incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in 
accordance with ICH guidelines  and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) E14 g uidance 
document.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 64 of 81 For the C-SSRS, the number and percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation or suicidal 
behavior during the study will be tabulated. 
Observed values and change from Baseline in the ESRS- A score will be summarized by 
treatment group and visit. The change from Baseline in the ESRS- A score will be analyzed 
using the MMRM method, similar to the MMRM method used to analyze the primary 
endpoint.  
Number and percentage of subjects with sexual dysfunction (a total score of <47 for men and 
<41 for women) will be summarized  and shift tables will be presented .   
9.5.4 Subgroup Analyses  
Selected analyses may be performed in subgroups. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.6 Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned .  
9.7 Measures to Minimize Bias  
9.7.1 Masking Procedures  
This unmasked protocol version provides details of certain study design elements, 
procedures, and statistical methods that are not available in the masked version of the 
protocol. 
This document is intended for use only by the unmasked Sponsor and restricted Worldwide 
Clinical Trials personnel and their designated agents for purposes of regulatory document preparation in conjunction with review by IRBs, IECs and regulatory authorities. Access to 
this document by other entities may be considered on a case- by-case basis by the Sponsor.  
The information contained herein is UNMASKED and CONFIDENTIAL. Therefore, it must 
NOT be shared with or communicated t o any individual at an investigational site or from site 
facing members of the clinical operations team of the contract research organization except with explicit and fully documented authorization from the Sponsor. 
The key element revealed but that is mas ked in the masked protocol is that the key timepoint 
for analysis of the efficacy endpoints is Week 5. 
Investigators will receive the masked version of the clinical study protocol.  
9.7.2 Randomization Procedures  
Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment groups (pimavanserin or 
placebo) in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive response technology (IRT) system. The assignments will be based on a pre- generated permuted -block randomization schedule. 
Blinding will be assured by restricting access of In vestigators and Sponsor personnel and/or

pimavanserin and placebo treatments . 
9.8 Breaking the Study Blind/Subject Code  
For the final analysis, the treatment codes for all s ubjects will be released to the Sponsor after 
all subjects have completed the study and the clinical database is locked.  
Unblinding of individual treatment assignment during the study is discouraged. The 
Investigator may break the blind in the event of a m edical emergency if it is considered 
necessary for the care of the subject. The Investigator should attempt whenever possible to 
contact the Medical Monitor before unblinding a subject’ s treatment to discuss the event. 
Lack of Medical Monitor contact does not preclude the Investigator from unblinding the subject.  In an emergency situation, the subject’s treatment assignment may be obtained by the 
Investigator from the IRT system. Details of the process to be followed are provided in a 
separate IRT manual. I n the event that the IRT system is used to perform a code break, the 
Sponsor or designee will be notified immediately via an automated notification from the 
IRT system that an unblinding has occurred. The notification only alerts the Sponsor or 
designee th at the unblinding occurred, and does not include any information about the 
unblinded subject’ s treatment assignment.  
10 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION 
10.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities 
All documents required for the conduct of the study as specified in the ICH GCP guidelines 
will be maintained by the Investigator in an orderly manner and made available for 
monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor and regulatory authorities . 
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor or 
designees (including monitors and auditors), regulatory authorities (including inspectors), and the IRB/EC direct access to source documents (such as original medical records). Direct 
access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and 
reports that are needed for the evaluation of the study. The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the eCRF was derived. 
10.2 Source Documents  
All study specific information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject ’s 
record (source documentation) and then entered into  a validated electronic data capture 
(EDC) database by trained site personnel. The source documentation may consist of source

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 66 of 81 notes captured by site personnel as well as laboratory reports, ECG reports, and electronic 
source data.  
10.3 Case Report Forms  
Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded in an EDC system on eCRFs. The 
Investigator and his or her site person nel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. The 
Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of all the information recorded on 
the eCRFs . All information requested on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subject  
identification  data, visit date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy will 
require explanation . All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source documentation at 
the site.  
10.4 Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject ’s anonymit y is maintained as described below. 
On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, subjects  must be 
identified by a s ubject  identification number only. Subject identifiers uniquely identify 
subjects within the study and do not ident ify any person specifically. Documents that are not 
for submission to the Sponsor or designees (e.g., signed ICFs, medical records submitted 
with SAE reporting) should be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator in compliance with Federal regulations or other applicable laws or ICH guidance on GCP. Data collection 
and handling should comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation  
(EU GDPR ), where applicable. The Sponsor has assigned a Data Protection Officer (DPO) as 
per the EU GDPR.  
10.5 Study Records Retention  
Investigators are required to maintain all essential study documentation  as per ICH GCP 
guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of signed, dated and completed eCRFs, 
documentation of eCRF corrections, signed ICFs, audio recordings, subject- related source 
documentation, and adequate records for the receipt and disposition of all study drug. Investigators should maintain all essential study documentation, for a period of at least 2 years following the last approval of marketing application in an ICH region (US, Europe, and Japan), or until at least 2 years after the drug investigational program is discontinued, 
unless a longer period is required by applicable law or regulation. Only the Sponsor can 
notify an Investigat or or vendor  when any records may be discarded . Investigators should 
contact  the Sponsor before destroying any files.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 67 of 81 10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed ; all subjects must me et all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study . 
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by the Sponsor under any circumstances. 
If, during the course of a subject’ s post-randomization participation in the trial it is 
discovered that the subject did not meet all eligibility criteria, this will be reported as a major 
protocol deviation and not a waiver. In this situation, the subject will be discontinued, unless 
the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow the 
subject to continue in the trial will be made by the Sponsor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed 
and documented as outlined in the protocol ( Section  6.4). The Investigator must report any 
protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local regulations, within reasonable time.  
Protocol deviations will be reviewed periodically over the course of the study. The review 
process, definition of the deviation categories, and the classification of a deviation as major or minor are detailed in the Protocol Deviation Management Plan. Protocol deviations will also be assessed with respect to relationship to COVID-19, and COVID -19 related protocol 
deviations will be tabulated.  
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by the Sponsor (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator) . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB /EC in 
accordance with local requirements and, if required, to regulatory authorities , as either an 
amendment or a notification . Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate h azard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. 
No approval is required for notifications. 
11 QUALITY MANA GEMENT 
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management appr oach that includes 
methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the 
trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial are operationally feasible and that any  unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s risk management approach includes the following 
activities with a focus on critical processes and critical study data:  
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 68 of 81 • Risk Identification: risks to critical trial process es, governing systems, investigational 
product, trial design, data collection, and recording are identified.  
• Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by considering the following factors: 
(a) likelihood of occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data integrity, 
and (c) detectability of errors.  
• Risk Control: risks that can be reduced (e.g., mitigating) or can be accepted are differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and 
implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the 
oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality 
tolerance limits are to be defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject safety or data integrity and devi ations from the predefined quality tolerance limits will 
trigger an evaluation and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for issues with a high risk factor that cannot be avoided. 
• Periodic risk review, communication, and escalation of risk ma nagement activities are 
ongoing during trial execution and risk outcomes are reported in the clinical study report (CSR).  
11.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor or designees and regulatory authority  inspectors are responsible for contacting 
and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that 
subject confidentiality is respected.  Some remote monitoring of study sites was also 
performed  as a result of the travel and visiting restrictions caused by the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on  the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH guidance on GCP and the Sponsor’ s audit plans, a certain percentage 
of sites participating in this study will be audited. These audits may include a review  of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related 
records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance w ith the protocol, 
ICH guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.

Inducers of Cytochrome P450 Enzyme 3A4  
The information presented here is intended to provide guidance and does not constitute an 
exhaustive list of strong CYP 3A4 enzyme ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitors and inducers. Any questions 
should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or appropriate designee. 
Subjects who require current treatment with a prohibited medication will be withdrawn from 
the study. 
Subjects who have previously taken a prohibited medication during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study unless:  
• the prohibited medication has been discontinued AND  
• withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The justification to allow the subject to continue in the study will be made by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. 
If allowed to remain in the study, this will be reported as a major protocol deviation and not a 
waiver.  
The metabolism of pimavanserin is affected by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in an increase in maximum (peak) observed drug concentration (C
max) of approximately 1.5-fold 
and area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) of approximately 3 -fold.  
Strong inhibitors of CY P3A4 are to be stopped at least 7 days or 5 half- lives  prior to 
investigational product administration, whichever is longer. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 are to be stopped 30 days or 5 half -lives  prior to investigational product administration, 
whichever is l onger.  Moderate inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 are allowed but should be 
used with caution.

a The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation -
dependent. Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor ” when a certain 
preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “ moderate CYP3A inhibitor ” when another 
preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength). (FDA Drug Development and Drug Interactions http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteracti onsLabelin

 Abstract  
 
This is a 2-year case series study . Study participants will act as their own controls. This study 
will determine if sacral root stimulation at 600 Hz limits urethral sphincter contractions in 
individuals with SCI who have already been implanted with a Finetech -Brindley SARS system. 
The Finetech -Brindley SARS system is an FDA -approved device (Humanitarian Use Device) 
and we have received an IDE for testing this device at 600 Hz. In an initial visit  lasting about 1 
hour, we will complete an informed consent process to enroll the participant and collect a 
urine sample to test for a UTI . In a second visit lasting about 4 hours, we will conduct 
experiment procedures. Bladder and urethral sphincter pressures will be recorded  using 
standard clinical urodynamics techniques . In a urodynamics laboratory, we will collect 
baseline  data in response to the typical stimulation parameters that the participant uses for 
their daily bladder management. We will then test 600 Hz stimulation to determine whether 
this results in reduced sphincter contraction (Aim 1). The Finetech -Brindley device can also 
be programmed to achieve bowel emptying and  return of bowel control is an extremely high 
priority for individuals with SCI [7]. Therefore, we will leverage the opportunity of this pilot 
study to determine if 600 Hz sacral root stimulation also has the potential to improve bowel 
emptying by reducing anal sphincter pressure ( Aim 2).  Participants will be asked to participate 
in experiments for both Aim 1 and Aim 2. Study participants who are Veterans will be 
consented and tested at the Cleveland VA Medical Center. Participants who are not Veterans 
will be consented and tested at the MetroHealth Medical Center. An IRB protocol for this 
study has already been approved at the MetroHealth Medical Center.

2.0 Introduction  
Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to neurogenic bladder dysfunctions, and often includes 
difficulty  with emptying the bladder due to detrusor -sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). 
Current bladder  management  strategies include catheterization, pharmaceuticals, 
and/or surgery, but these interventions insufficiently meet  individuals’ needs. The 
neurogenic bladder can be emptied using sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) with  
electrodes implanted on the sacral nerves to produce bladder contractions. However, 
this emptying can be  impeded by reflex contractions of the urethral sphincter. The 
sacral sensory roots are typically transected  (rhizotomy) to reduce these reflex 
contractions, but this rhizotomy also impairs desirable reflexes ( e.g., sexual  function) 
and sacral sensation if present. Experiments in animals have shown that sacral root 
stimulation at  600 Hz can inhibit urethral sphincter activity, which has the potential. This 
approach could be used in lieu of the  rhizotomy to improve bladder emptying efficiency.   
 
3.0 Objectives  
The objective of this study is to test the potential effectiveness of 600 Hz sacral root 
stimulation to limit urethral sphincter activity in individuals with neurogenic bladder 
dysfunction  (Aim 1) . We hypothesize that sacral root stimulation at 600 Hz will result in 
lower urethral sphincter pressures compared to pressures in response to stimulation at 
the lower frequencies that are typically used for SARS.  We will also test if this 
stimulation similarly limits anal sphincter activity (Aim 2). Individuals will already have 
received an implanted SARS device and will have also received a rhizotomy.

5.0 Study Procedures  
 
5.1 Study Design  
In this 2-year case series  study, we will enroll 8 participants, male or female, who 
have SCI and who  already use implanted sacral root anterior stimulation to 
manage their bladder. Participants will act as their own  controls.  
 
If a participant is a Veteran, then they will complete study visits at the Cleveland 
VA Medical Center. If they are not a Veteran, then they will complete study visits 
at MetroHealth Medical Center for which we already have an approved IRB 
protocol.  
 
During an initial study visit, expected to take about one hour, we will obtain 
informed consent. Then a sample of urine will be collected and tested to 
determine if they have a urinary tract infection.  
 
In the days following this initial visit, subjects will be prescribed an antibiotic, 
which they will pick up from Pharmacy, to take in the days before and after 
participation in this study to prevent a urinary tract infection. We will contact 
subjects in the days leading up to the second visit to remind them  of the 
antibiotic.  
 
[Protocol V 2 Feb2023 ]  VAIRRS  Protocol Template – version 10/15/2020  Page 8 of 15 
 A second study visit will then occur 2 -30 days later and last about 4 hours. 
Stimulus waveforms for urethral sphincter inhibition will be tested in the clinical 
laboratory in a single  session. We will not need to conduct new surgeries or 
implant procedures. The primary outcome measure is  urethral sphincter 
pressure, and additional outcome measures include bladder pressure, rectal 
pressure, and  bladder volume as measured in clinically standard urodynamics 
examination.  The primary outcome measure for Aim 2 is anal sphincter pressure.  
 
Clinical Impact  
This study represents the first attempt to limit urethral sphincter contraction via 
600 Hz stimulation of sacral roots in human participants. This approach using 
600 Hz sacral root stimulation has successfully demonstrated voiding in chronic 
spinalized dogs, but has not been tested in humans. The Finetech -Brindley 
external controller has been modified to be capable of producing stimulation up 
to 600Hz. An Investigational Device Exemption has been obtained from the FDA 
to test this approach in human participants. Thus, one significant advantage of 
our study is that we will use this modified external controller to communicate with 
the already -implanted components of the system without new surgical 
procedures or significant risks. A second key advantage is that, because they 
have had a posterior rhizotomy, we can determine the stimulation parameters for 
activating and potentially limiting sphincter activity directly via the motor nerves, 
without confounding effects from sacral spinal reflexes. If this project is 
successful, these parameters can be applied in a future project to individuals who 
can have a stimulator implanted without rhizotomy, to determine if reflex 
activation of the sphincter can also be reduced. We understand that future work 
without rhizotomy will include the influence of reflex pathways, and this study 
may help us understand that influence by having this negative control. A future 
project would also then refine this approach by combining 600 Hz stimulation to 
reduce sphincter pressure with 20 Hz stimulation to evoke bladder contraction.  
 
This project could have a high impact for individuals with neurogenic bladder 
dysfunction. It would help to address one of the highest priorities of individuals 
with SCI – restoration of bladder function - and help to address some of the 
biggest costs and health risks associated with managing neurogenic bladder by 
potentially improving bladder emptying without the need for catheters. There is a 
high potential for clinical translation because this approach takes advantage of 
existing technologies.  
 
If this project demonstrates evidence of urethral sphincter pressure reduction in 
response to 600 Hz stimulation, then we will propose in a subsequent project to 
apply 600 Hz stimulation to individuals with SCI in whom sacral reflexes are 
intact. We would implant a SARS device without the rhizotomy, and determine if 
reflex contractions of the sphincter can be prevented during bladder emptying. In 
this way, we plan to achieve efficient, catheter -free, on -demand bladder emptying 
using sacral root stimulation without the need for a posterior rhizotomy.

5.2 Recruitment Methods  
Eight participants will be enrolled, both men and women. Participants will be 
recruited from a pool of  approximately 50 individuals who have already been 
implanted in Cleveland with the Finetech -Brindley SARS  system. Individuals who 
are already implanted with the SARS system receive regular follow -up contact 
regarding their system. Our clinical colleagues will ask them about their interest 
in this study.  Individuals who express interest will then be contacted by our study 
team for study enrollment. We conservatively estimate  that at least 50% of these 
individuals can be reached for follow -up and 50% of those individuals will be  
willing  to participate in this study. We have already received confirmation from 4 
such individuals of their interest in  participating in this work. Therefore, we are 
confident that we will not have difficulty recruiting for this study.  
 
Study subjects will be compensated $ 75 for their participation  via Greenphire 
ClinCard . This compensation rate is consistent with  subject honoraria at our local 
site. They will receive Payment after each visit, including $25 if they complete the 
first visit and $50 if they complete the second visit.  If the participants  do not have 
a private vehicle, transportation will be provided to them.  
 
5.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
The PI (Dr. Bourbeau ), or other staff authorized to obtain informed consent,  will 
explain the study in person,  answer questions, and obtain informed consent for 
participation in this study. The consent process will take  place in privacy in a 
quiet room. The study goals and an overview of the experiment will be  reviewed 
with each participant. Special care will be taken to inform the participant of all the 
potential risks of  participation and that they may choose to withdraw from the 
study at any point. HIPAA guidelines will be  followed by all study staff. For VA 
study participants, signed consent forms will be stored in a locked drawer in a 
locked room  (B-E336) . Consent  will be obtained during the initial visit . The 
consent form will include  contact information for the research team should the 
subject have further questions during the study.

5.5 Study Evaluations  
We will use standard clinical urodynamics methods for data collection. We will 
use a n FDA -approved  modified external  controller to communicate with the 
already -implanted components of the system, so no new surgeries or other  
procedures are required. The device has been modified to achieve frequencies 
up to 600 Hz and this modification was approved by the FDA in an IDE. We will 
document their normal daily usage device settings for reference, including  
stimulation amplitude, pulse width, frequency, and on/off cycle duration.  
 
Clinical Urodynamics and Anorectal Manometry Procedure : A standard catheter 
will be inserted into the  bladder via the urethra and the bladder will be emptied. 
This catheter will be removed and then a second  catheter, which can measure 
bladder and urethral pressures , will be  inserted. This catheter will also have a 
lumen for filling the bladder with sterile saline. A balloon  catheter inserted in the 
rectum will be used to reflect abdominal pressure and distinguish bladder 
pressures  due to detrusor contraction versus bladder pressures due to 
abdominal activity. This balloon catheter will  measure rectal pressure. It will also 
have pressure transducers at the anal sphincter to measure anal sphincter  
pressure. Surface electromyogram (EMG) electrodes will be applied to the anal 
sphincter to monitor pelvic floor  muscle contractions. Infused volumes will be 
controlled via an infusion pump. EMG and pressure signals will  be monitored on 
a clinical urodynamic system. The participant’s bladder will be infused with  sterile  
saline while  measuring bladder, urethral sphincter, and rectal pressures.   
 
Sacral Anterior Root Stimulation : We will set the stimulation parameters for the 
implanted stimulator, including  stimulation amplitude and frequency, using a 
modified Finetech -Brindley external controller unit. The frequency  will be set 
either to 600 Hz or to the low  frequency that the participant typically  uses for 
emptying their bladder, which  is usually 20 Hz. We will use the  participant’s own 
power transmission  coil. The receiver coil and electrodes  will already have been 
implanted. The  pulse width will not be changed from  the participant’s normal 
setting.  
 
Aim 1: Determine if 600 Hz sacral  root stimulation limits contraction of  the 
urethral sphincter.  
 
During visit 2, in a single session, we will first administer SARS using  the 
stimulation parameters ( i.e., frequency, pulse width, and amplitude)  that the 
study participant typically uses  to empty their bladder and has been for  years. 
The purpose is to characterize the usual level of urethral sphincter and bladder 
pressure during their bladder emptying routines and collect these baseline data. 
[Protocol V 2 Feb2023 ]  VAIRRS  Protocol Template – version 10/15/2020  Page 11 of 15 
 We will also have a frame of reference for stimulation amplitude for testing 600 
Hz stimulation.  
 
We will then decrease the stimulation amplitude and identify the threshold 
amplitude to achieve urethral sphincter contraction at low frequency, which will 
be compared to the threshold amplitude to evoke bladder contraction. The motor 
efferents innervating the urethral sphincter are significantly larger in diameter 
than the motor efferents innervating the bladder, so the thresholds for activating 
the bladder are higher than for activating the urethral sphincter. These thresholds 
amplitudes at low frequency will give us additional context for evaluating the 
recruitment of urethral sphincter and bladder pressures in response to sacral 
stimulation.  
 
We will then test stimulation at 600 Hz. 600 Hz stimulation will first evoke a brief 
(~1-2 second) onset respond and then the urethral pressure is expected to return 
to baseline. The stimulation amplitude will be set to 0 mA and gradually 
increased to determine the threshold amplitude for evoking an initial onset 
response of the urethral sphincter. We will continue to increase the stimulation 
amplitude until we have achieved maximal urethral sphincter pressure onset 
response. Stimulation will be maintained for up to 10 seconds with at least 30 
seconds rest between stimuli. Once this recruitment curve is established, we will 
repeat stimulation at threshold, 50% maximal recruitment, and 90% maximal 
recruitment for up to 30 seconds to measure reduction of urethral sphincter 
pressures.  
 
Aim 2: Determine if 600 Hz sacral root stimulation limits contraction of the 
anal sphincter.  
 
This aim has the same design as Aim 1 but will focus on bowel function. Data for 
this aim will be measured during the same session as Aim 1. We will administer 
SARS using the stimulation parameters and pattern that the participant typically 
uses to empty their bowel and has been for years. These data will give us 
context for evaluating effects on bowel function.  
 
We will then test stimulation at 600 Hz. This testing can be done simultaneously 
with 600 Hz testing for Aim 1. The stimulation amplitude will be set to 0 mA and 
gradually increased to determine the threshold amplitude for evoking an initial 
onset response of the anal sphincter. We will continue to increase the stimulation 
amplitude until we have achieved maximal anal sphincter pressure onset 
response. Stimulation will be maintained for up to 10 seconds with at least 30 
seconds rest between stimuli. Once this recruitment curve is established, we will 
repeat stimulation at threshold, 50% maximal recruitment, and 90% maximal 
recruitment for up to 30 seconds to measure reduction of anal sphincter 
pressures.

 5.6 Data Analysis  
Outcomes from urodynamics data will be used to determine the effect of 
electrical stimulation on limiting  urethral and anal sphincter pressures. 
Distributions of pressures without and with 600 Hz and 20 Hz  stimulation will be 
compared with an ANOVA and a significance level of 0.05. We expect to observe 
a lower  level of urethral and anal sphincter pressure in response to sacral 
stimulation at frequencies of 600 Hz  compared to the low stimulation frequency 
that participants typically use.  
 
Potential Limitations and Alternative Solutions  
If 600Hz sacral stimulation in humans fails to limit urethral and anal sphincter 
activity compared to what is  evoked at low frequency, then we will need to 
consider alternative stimulation strategies in future studies. We  acknowledge that 
another potential approach using kilohertz frequency stimulation could be 
considered. Our  group and others have tested kilohertz frequency sinusoidal 
waveforms extensively preclinically to block nerve  
conduction. This could be another alternative to the rhizotomy, but it would 
require development and regulatory  approval of a new implantable stimulation 
system that can safely deliver stimulation in the kilohertz frequency  range for 
human testing [14] – [18]. 
 
We do not expect to experience significant technical challenges because (1) we 
are using a SARS system  that study participants have been successfully using 
for years and (2) we are using research methods that we  have successfully used 
for years to collect these data [19], [20]. We may find that the external controller 
does  not deliver sufficient charge to achieve sphincter reduction at elevated 
stimulation frequencies. This is unlikely  because the amplitude required to avoid 
contraction at 600Hz frequencies is not significantly higher than the amplitude to 
achieve activation at lower amplitudes.  
 
5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
There may be instances that would require investigators to terminate a 
participant’s participation in this study. Investigators will stop the experiment if the 
participant demonstrate s any unresolved physical or psychological discomfort.  
 
6.0 Risks   
 
Tissue Damage  – rare. There is a small risk that the neural tissue may be 
damaged by the application of electrical stimulation. This risk will be minimized 
by applying stimulation within amplitude and duration parameters that were safe 
and effective in chronic preclinical experiments.  
 
Urinary tract infection : This risk is uncommon. There is a risk of less than 10% 
that a subject  will develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) following urodynamics in 
this study. This risk will be minimized by performing catheterization with sterile 
technique and by taking antibiotics before and after the experiment as 
[Protocol V 2 Feb2023 ]  VAIRRS  Protocol Template – version 10/15/2020  Page 13 of 15 
 prescribed. If a subject experience s signs or symptoms of a UTI (such as blood 
in the urine, frequency, urgency, increased spasms, fever, chills, and/or pain in 
the lower back) after the study, please contact a member of the study team. 
Subjects  will be advised on how to proceed for medical treatment.  
 
Urethral trauma : This risk is uncommon. There is a small risk, which we estimate 
at approximately 2%, that a subject will experience mild trauma to the urethra as 
a result of catheterization for this study. Such trauma might result in a small 
amount of bleeding from the surface of the urethra, similar to that seen from the 
gums on vigorous tooth -brushing. This risk will be minimized by lubricating the 
catheter with sterile water -soluble gel and by careful catheterization technique.  
 
Discomfort during urodynamic testing : Subjects  may experience some discomfort 
from lying down for up to four hours at a time during these procedures. If so, the 
investigators will assist subjects  in changing position to become more 
comfortable. The investigators will assist subjects  in changing position at least 
every 2 hours, if the procedures last that long, to reduce the risk of pressure 
injuries . 
 
Reproductive Health/Sexual Activity : The effects on the developing child of using 
electrical stimulation during pregnancy and the risk of birth defects are unknown. 
Therefore, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not participate in this 
study.  
 
7.0 Reporting  
 
The investigators have participated in the necessary training activities related to human 
subject experimentation, protecting study volunteers in research, and passed required 
computerized training. Because this is a case series study, the primary concern is 
participant safety. The primary reporting channels within the VA will be used to assure 
study compliance and review of adverse events if they occur.   
 
8.0 Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
Local and central VA data security standards and protocols will be observed.  Research 
Records will be retained in accordance with RCS 10 -1. Electronic data will be stored on 
a password -protected VA drive  (R:/Bourbeau) . Physical  documents will be stored in a 
locked drawer in the PI's locked office  in B-E336 . All data will  be de -identified. Data 
collected during the course of the study will be associated  with subjects using distinct 
alpha -numeric codes and the encoding key will be  securely stored.   
 
9.0 Communication Plan  
 
The PI will complete reporting to oversight and regulatory bodies as required by 
standard procedures for these bodies, including but not limited to, Cleveland VA 
[Protocol V 2 Feb2023 ]  VAIRRS  Protocol Template – version 10/15/2020  Page 14 of 15

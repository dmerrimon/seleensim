2.0 Objectives  
The purpose of this study is  to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness, safety, 
function,  comfort , and patient satisfaction  with a novel vaginal pessary design for the use 
in women who suffer from symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and have already 
opted for non -surgical management. Recruited subjects  will have Stage II POP or greater 
and will be current users of a Gellhorn or ring style  pessary. Following enrollment, each 
subject will enter a 1 -month wash out period in which they will continue using their 
current pessary so that baseline subjective and objective data can be collected. They will 
then be fit with a study pessary and enter a 3 -month treatment phase. Comparative , 
subjective  and objective data will be collected at the conclusion of the study.  
 
3.0 Background  
POP is a prevalent condition that can be observed in over 50% of women over the age of 
50.1 POP results from a we akening of the pelvic floor connective tissue and muscles, 
allowing the uterus or vaginal walls to descend.  Typical symptoms , which include bulge 
and pressure, urinary dysfunction, defecatory dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction , can 
result in physical dis comfort, emotional distress, and disrupt activities of daily life.  
Using published data on weighted prevalence rates of specific pelvic floor disorders2 in 
conjunction with US census data, it can be estimated that the number of US women with 
symptomatic p rolapse in 2016 was 3.6 million.  The lifetime risk for a woman to have 
surgery for pelvic organ prolapse is 12.6%, or 1:8.3 As the specialty of Female Pelvic 
Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) matures and surgical outcomes are being 
followed with  more scrutiny, it is becoming increasingly clear that surgical treatment 
options are less effective than once believed. The 3 most effective and commonly 
performed procedures for apical prolapse have estimated composite recurrence rates by 6 
years of 43%,  49%, and 57%.4  
 
The vaginal pessary is an effective treatment option for POP. A pessary is inserted in the 
vagina and acts as a shelf resting upon the pelvic floor muscles to support the descending 
organs.  A pessary is not surgically implanted and can b e removed and reinserted but is 
only effective while in situ. Often, pessaries are as effective as reconstructive surgery in 
improving the symptoms of prolapse. 77% of practicing urogynecologists recommend a 
vaginal pessary as the first line treatment opti on for their patients with POP.5 It is 
estimated that there are ~2.3 million women in the United States who use a pessary for 
POP, based on financial information from pessary makers and the above epidemiologic 
data on POP. The root cause failure of current pessaries in common use is their  rigid and 
fixed design, which makes them difficult or impossible for patients to remove and insert 
independently. Consequently, medical practitioners in the United States see most pessary 
users at least 3 -4 times per year to temporarily remove the pessary , clean it, examine the

vagina for epithelial erosions, and then reinsert the pessary.6 These steps are needed to 
avoid preventable complications associated with long term pessary use which have been 
reported as high as 56%7 and include vaginal erosion, bl eeding, increased discharge, as 
well as discomfort and dysfunction in voiding and defecation.8 Furthermore, women who 
experience less severe forms of prolapse and who do not need the support of their pessary 
outside of strenuous physical activity often mus t wear their pessary when not necessary, 
which induces additional lifestyle impacts such as impairing a woman’s ability to engage 
in sexual intercourse.  
 
The two most commonly used pessaries on the market are the “ring with support ” and the 
“Gellhorn ” pessary. The Gellhorn pessary is clinically more effective to reduce the life 
impact of prolapse symptoms,9 and once fit has longer continuation rates than the ring 
with support (10.5 years vs. 1.8 years).10 Additionally, the Gellhorn successfully treated 
71% of women at 3 months who failed treatment with the ring with support.11 Yet most 
practitioners, particularly Ob/Gyn physicians who are not additionally specialized in 
FPMRS, preferentially prescribe the ring style pessaries  because they are easier and more  
intuitive to use. The Reia Vaginal  Pessary  (study pessary)  has been engineered to 
improve the comfort and ability of pessary removal and reinsertion by  physicians and 
patients. The Reia Vaginal  Pessary has a structural form similar to  the Gellhorn , but is 
collapsible,  and is hypothesized to be simpler and more comfortable  to use than ring style 
pessaries.   This hypothesis is  preliminarily  supported by data obtained in an early 
feasibility , in-office trial with 15 subjects  (NCT 04275089) .    
 
4.0 Study Endpoints  
The primary and secondary endpoints of the study are described in the following table:

Primary  Pelvic Floor Distress 
Inventory -20 (PFDI -
20)  Between enrollment and 
the end of washout 
period (before treatment ) 
[Week 0 -4] and post 
treatment [Week 16]   The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory - 
20 (PFDI -20) is a validated 
instrument to assess the presence and 
bother of symptoms that pelvic floor 
disorders have on health -related 
quality of life  in women. It is a 20 -
item questionnaire and the short 
form of the 46 question PFDI. There 
are three subscales: Urinary Distress 
Inventory 6 (UDI -6), Colorectal -
Anal Distress Inventory 8 (CRADI -
8), and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse 
Distress Inventory 6 (POPDI -6). The 
overall score range is 0 -300. The 
higher the score, the greater the 
perceived impact that pelvic floor 
dysfunction has on a patient's life. 
The minimal important change in the

effect in women choosing 
conservative management of their 
prolapse  (i.e. a pessary)  is between 
13.5 and 18.3 points.  
Primary  Prevalence and 
severity of adverse 
events that subjects  
experience using the 
study pessary 
compared to those 
experienced with their 
current pessary  Throughout study [Week 
0-16] Adverse events 
can occur with use of the 
current pessary or during 
the treatment phase with 
the study pessary. They 
can be experience d with 
insertion or removal of 
either the current or 
study pessary, noted on 
physical exam, or 
reported at any time.  Adverse events experienced with 
insertion or removal of the current or 
study pessary include : pelvic 
cramping or discomfort, perineal 
tear, failure of the study pessary to 
deploy or collapse, or pessary 
expulsion. Adverse events noted on 
physical exam include: vaginal 
irritation, vaginal ecchymosis, 
vaginal abrasions/superficial cuts, 
vaginal erosion, vaginal bleeding, 
vaginal discharge, or urinary 
retention. Adverse events which 
could occur at any time include: 
pelvic cramping or mild discomfort, 
copious vaginal discharge, urinary 
tract infection, substantial 
discomfort, pessary expulsion 
(collapsed or deployed), or adverse 
events unrelated to the pessary or 
study visit. Each event will be 
classified as mild (transient and 
easily tolerated by the subject ), 
moderate (causing discomfort or 
interrupting usual activities), or 
severe (causing considerable 
interference with usual activities, 
may be incapacitating, or may 
require hospitalization).

6.0 Procedures Involved  
Methods  
This is  a non-randomized prospective trial . Treatment intervention will be non -blinded to 
the subject and the investigator.  Subjects  will serve as their own controls and enter the 
treatment phase of the study after a 1 -month washout period of using their current 
pessary.   Subjects will be recruited for this study from panel s of patients in clinical 
practice s specializing in Female Pelvic Med icine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) . 
Inclusion will be based on pre -defined criteria outlined in “10.0 Inclusion and Exclusion 
Criteria .”  
 
The primary outcome measure will be the change in the scores of the Pelvic Floor 
Distress Inventory -20 (PFDI -20), administered first during the washout period while still 
using their current pessary and then at the conclusion of the treatment phase with th e 
study pessary. The PFDI -20 is a validated health -related quality of life instrument to 
assess the presence and bother of symptoms  in women with pelvic floor dysfunction. For 
women with relatively mild pelvic floor symptoms, a minimal important change (MI C) of 
between 13.5 and 18 .3 points in the PFDI -20 score can be considered clinically relevant. 
At least f ifty subjects will be enrolled , expecting that after drop -out and attrition at least 
40 subjects  will have  complete d the study. This provides power of .80 for a MIC 
equivalence limit of 17 points on the PFDI -20 scale .  
 
There will not be discrimination based on race or ethnicity. It is anticipated that most 
participants will be post -menopausal as this reflects the demographic of women who 
suffer from thi s disorder.  
 
The study will take place over 4 visits (Visit 0, Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3).  
 
Visit 0 [research purposes ] will involve screening, enrollment, consent , subject 
questionnaires, and chart abstraction for historical data  and will take place during a 
regularly scheduled pessary maintenance visit.  The current pessary size and type will be 
recorded, and it will be observed in situ for the presence of rotation and its ability to 
support prolapse by measuring the distance of the most d ependent compartment of the 
subject ’s prolapse to the hymen  (POP-Q points Ba and Bp) , as well as the distance from 
the leading edge of the current pessary , if a Gellhorn,  to the hymen . After removal of the 
current pessary, a b aseline physical exam will be conducted to assess for pre -existing 
vaginal pathology (ecchymoses, abrasions, superficial cuts, erosions , granulation tissue , 
bleeding ) or urinary retention  associated with current pessary use . Other exam elements 
will include assessment of vulvovaginal  atrophy, pelvic muscle strength,  perineal 
descent , and POP -Q points GH (with strain) and TVL . After cleaning, t he current pessary 
will be replaced,  and each subject will begin the  washout period where they continue use 
of their current pessary. Either at th is first visit or during the washout period, each subject  
will complete the PFDI -20, PFIQ -7, and PISQ -R to establish baseline scores.  Self-

managers will track the frequency of re movals. If the current pessary cannot be 
reinserted , they will be treated according to standard of care.  
Visit 1  [research purposes ] will aim to be scheduled between 3 and 5 weeks  from Visit 0 
(the conclusion of the washout period). Demographic and historical data will be extracted 
from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) if not completed at Visit 0 and supplemented 
by the subject  as needed. Global subject  satisfaction of the current pessary wil l be 
assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with a 10  cm linear continuum in which 0 
represents no satisfaction and 10 represents complete satisfaction. As in Visit 0, the 
current  pessary  will be observed in situ for the presence of rotation and its ab ility to 
support prolapse by measuring the distance of the most dependent compartment of the 
subject’s prolapse to the hymen  (points Ba and Bp) , as well as the distance from the 
leading edge of the current pessary to the hymen. The current pessary will be removed , 
washed, placed in a sealed bag, labeled and either stored or given to the subject  for them  
to return with at their final visit . The physical exam will be repeated as in Visit 0, and the 
presence  of perineal disruption associated current pessary  removal will be noted. The 
appropriate study pessary  size for the subject based on the provided mapping  from the 
subject’s current pessary  and practitioner’s expertise  will be selected at random from the 
inventory of study pessaries , removed from its seal ed bag , and the study pessary’s serial 
number (labeled on the bag) will be recorded. The subject  will be fit with the study 
pessary. If a study pessar y cannot be fit, and the patient is willing, they can be fit with a 
different sized pessary  at Visit 1 or  can remain in the study and return for a second 
attempt  to be fit with a study pessary  at Visit 2. A VAS will be used to assess the 
perceived discomfort with removal of the current pessary and , separ ately,  with insertion 
of the study pessary. For self -managers, ease of current pessary removal and reinsertion 
will be noted using a VAS and teaching will be provided on the proper technique to insert 
and remove the study pessary.  
Visit 2 [research purpos es] has the option to be omitted , at the discretion of the  
practitioner  and the subject , and will be aimed to be scheduled within 1-3 week s of Visit 
1. The subject will receive a phone call just prior to this visit. The subject will be asked 
about pessary use and adverse events. If the subject is doing well without any study 
related concerns, the practitioner and subject can decide if this visit can be om itted. The 
purpose of this visit is to minimize unforeseeable risks  associated with use of the study 
pessary and/or to refit a subject with a study pessary if the original one was expelled  or 
could not be inserted during Visit 1 . If conducted in person, p hysical exam will be 
performed to assess for vaginal pathology (ecchymoses, abrasions, superficial cuts, 
erosions, granulation tissue or bleeding) or urinary retention related to the study pessary , 
and all adverse events will be recorded . The study  pessary will be observed in situ for the 
presence of rotation and its ability to support prolapse by measuring the distance of the 
most dependent compartment of the subject’s prolapse to the hymen, as well as the 
distance from the leading edge of the  study  pessary to the hymen.  Those subjects  who

were  not successfully fit with a study pessary in their first visit  would be fit with a new 
study pessary . 
 
Visit 3 [research purposes ] will occur at the conclusion of the 3 -month (from Visit 1) 
treatment phase - a typical length of time between routine visits for patients who choose 
long term pessary management of their prolapse. It can be scheduled in a window 
between 11 and 13 weeks from Visit 1.  When the subject  returns for Visit 3, a physica l 
exam will be repeated , as in previous visits , for comparative data. The study pessary will 
be observed in situ for the presence of rotation and its ability to support prolapse by 
measuring the distance of the most dependent compartment of the subject’s p rolapse to 
the hymen  (Points Ba and Bp) , as well as the distance from the leading edge of the study 
pessary to the hymen. A VAS will be used to assess discomfort with removal of the study 
pessary, discomfort with reinsertion of their current pessary, and t heir global satisfaction 
of the study pessary. The subject will have been instructed to return with their current 
pessary which was removed in Visit 1.  If the su bject’s current pessary is not brought to 
the visit , they will be given a new  pessary of the size and style of their current pessary. 
Each subjec t will complete the PFDI -20, PFIQ -7, and PISQ -R for a post treatment 
comparison. For self -managers, other data collected will include frequency of removal 
and a VAS for  ease of study pessary insertion and removal.  
 
Additional Visits: Subjects will be seen as necessary and adverse events will be managed 
according  to standard of care.  If the study pessary falls out after Visit 1, the subject may 
be seen at their convenience for reinsertion or res izing.  If a study pessary cannot be fit 
and retained, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and their current pessary will 
be placed.  If the subject’s current pessary is not brought to the visit, they will be given a 
new pessary of the size and style of their current pessary.  
 
Special Circumstances: If a subject dies between Visit 1 and Visit 3, an attempt will be 
made to contact the coroner to retrieve the study pessary.  If the study pessary cannot be 
retrieved, a copy of the death certificate will be obtained.  
 
The study pessary is the only device that will be used in this trial . There will be no 
placebo devices placed. The study pe ssary is not cleared by the FDA, and a rationale is 
provided for a non -significant risk device claim in the attached documents.  
 
Data Collected  
See attached data collection forms. The data collected will be obtained through chart 
abstraction, verbal history, questionnaire responses, visual analogue scale response, and 
physical exam.  
Data collected on adverse events will be described in “18.0 Provisions to Monitor 
the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects.”

Transition from Research Participation  
At the conclusion of the study, each subject will  have their current pessary replaced in 
their vagina, and they will be instructed to present for their next routinely scheduled 
follow up visit per their typical care.  If a subject lost their original pessary or if they do 
not bring it to the final visit, they will be supplied with a new pessary identical to their 
original at no additional cost.

10.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Sex of Subjects  
Pelvic organ  prolapse (POP) is a disease which only affects females, most typically those 
who are post -menopausal. Males will not be recruited for this study.  
 
Age of Subjects  
Study subjects  will be at least 18 years old. Pelvic organ prolapse is condition primarily 
developed post-menopaus e and is therefore not relevant to the  female  population under  
18 years old.  
 
Racial and Ethnic Origin  
This is a  safety and efficacy study in which  at least  50 subjects will be recruited . Eligible 
subjects will be screened for participation sequentially as they present for routine pessary 
care at the study sites without excluding individuals based on race or ethnicity. The 
distribution of race and ethnicity for potential subjects will refle ct the demographics of 
patients in the practices at the sites.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
• Females  with Stage II pelvic organ prolapse or greater  
• User s of a Gellhorn  (inclusive of size s 2”-3.25”) or ring style pessary  (inclusive of 
sizes 2.5 -3.5”) for >3 months ’ duration  
• Fluency in English or Spanish  
• Capable of giving informed consent  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
• Pregnancy  
• Short vaginal length ( total vaginal length  < 8 cm), or subjective vaginal narrowing  
• Deep vaginal erosion noted with removal of current  pessary  
• Presenc e of vesicovaginal fistula  
• Presence of rectovaginal fistula  
• Current treatment for vaginal, rectal, or bladder tumor  
• Presence of open wound or tear near vagina or anus by exam prior to removal of 
current pessary

TITLE   COLLAPSIBLE PESSARY FEASIBILITY TRIAL PROTOCOL  
   
CONFIDENTIAL  
• Presence of pelvic, vaginal, or urinary infection requiring treatment  
• Ongoing treatment  of recurrent urinary  tract or  vaginal infections  
• Inflammatory bowel disease  
• Chronic pain syndromes of pelvic or anorectal origin  
• Previous pelvic floor surgery in last 12 months  
• Congenital malformation of bladder, rectum, or vagina  
• Significant medical condition interfering with study participation (psychologic, 
neurologic, active drug/alcohol abuse, etc.)  
• Planning pregnancy in next 6 months  
 
Total study recruitment across all sites will have  a requirement to include a minimum of 
12 subjects (approximately 25%) who currently use a Gellhorn pessary and a minimum 
of 12 subjects who currently use a ring style pessary to best characterize the current 
landscape where the Reia Pessary will be used. Current users of Gellhorn pessaries are 
more likely to have advanced baseline prolapse, and current users of ring style pessaries 
are more likely to be self -managers. It is important for both demographics to be 
represented in this study.  
 
Vulnerable Subjec ts  
The following groups of subjects will not be recruited: pregnant females , prisoners , 
females  in mental health facilities , employees of the study site , and students attending 
any of the study institution s. 
 
11.0 Vulnerable Populations  
N/A 
 
12.0 Recruitment Methods  
Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited from panels of established patients in the clinical sites , and will 
occur in one of three ways:  
 
1. Subjects  can be informed about the study a s they present for routine pessary care, 
and if interested, handed a consent form for review, then booked for Visit 0 at the 
time their next routinely  schedule d pessary mainten ance visit.   Please see attached 
patient flyer document . 
2. If a Partial HI PAA Waiver is granted, s ubjects can be recruited  with a letter , flyer,  
and/or a screening telephone call ahead of a normally scheduled visit. Potential 
subjects will be identified  during a given we ek of care based on scheduled visit 
type, duration, and type of pessary currently in use. Their  name, medical record 
number, and telephone number recorded on a handwritten list with pen and paper.  
With the list complied, subjects may be contacted by  mail, using the submitted 
  
 DOCUMENT 
NUMBER  CP-002-01 r 03

23 
TITLE   COLLAPSIBLE PESSARY FEASIBILITY TRIAL PROTOCOL  
   
CONFIDENTIAL  
letter and/or flyer, and/or telephone, using the submitted  phone  script  (see 
attached document) , and their interest in participation will be gauged. The list will 
be shredded after all potential subjects are contacted. If they de monstrate a 
preliminary interest, they will be scheduled for the appropriate amount of time to 
complete consent in -person and enter the study as they present for their pessary 
care visit.  Additionally, the recruiter will offer to send electronically or mail 
prospective subjects a copy of the consent form to review ahead of their 
appointment. If the latter, p referred mailing addresses will be collected over the 
telephone and handwritten directly on the mailing envelope and not copied 
elsewhere.  
3. Subjects  can also be recruited for participation at the time of a n already scheduled 
visit if there is latitude in the schedule to extend the visit and complete the 
consent process and other aspects of Visit 0 . 
4. Advertisements (pending IRB approval) will be posted on so cial media , online, 
and/or in print . 
 
Payment for Participation  
Subjects  will be offered three separate  $100 gift card s in compensation for the ir time due 
to participation that is in excess of routine pessary care.   Visits 0  and 3 would occur as 
part of routine care.  A $100 gift  card will be provided  after completing Visits 1 and 2 
(even if conducted as a phone call ) for extra time and travel, as well as at Visit 3 upon 
completion of the study . In total, subjects will have received  $300  at the completion of 
the study.  
 
Alternatives to Participation  
If the patient elect s not to participate in the study, they will proceed with their usual 
appointment and care.  
 
13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Reasons for a subject to be withdrawn from  the research study include:  
• The subject is found to have a condition that does not allow participation in the 
research, such as a finding upon physical examination that excludes them from the 
study . 
• The subject no longer tolerates their current pessary du ring the washout period or 
needs a different size or type of pessary during the washout period.  
• The subject is not able to be fit with a study pessary at the conclusion of Visit 2, or 
the study pessary is repeatedly expelled . 
• The study pessary causes discomfort o r adverse reaction  for which continued use is 
contraindicated.  
• The subject has a reaction that requires immediate removal of the study  pessary . 
• The subject may withdraw themselves  at any point for unforeseen circumstances.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
If a subject is removed  from the study , already collected data may not be removed from 
the study database and will be handled with the same protocol as research data.  The 
subject will receive the usual ongoing c are for their pessary . 
 
14.0 Risks to Subjects  
This study will involve greater than minimal risk. The subject could experience:  
 
• Discomfort during insertion, use, or removal of the study pessary.  
• Minor abrasion of the vagina or perineum with insertion or remova l of the study 
pessary.  
• Vaginal bleeding caused by the study pessary.  
• Increased vaginal discharge caused by the study pessary.  
• Vaginal epithelial erosion (superficial or deep) from using the study pessary.  
• Difficulty urinating or leakage of urine caused by  the study pessary.  
• Difficulty with defecation caused by the study pessary.  
• Embarrassment if the study pessary falls out.  
• Minor discomfort if the study pessary rotates out of position or if it falls out.  
• Inconvenience caused by the inability of the study p essary to support the subject’s 
prolapse.  
 
Each of the risks cited above exist for any patient who chooses a pessary for management 
of their prolapse and are not unique to the study pessary.  Though inconvenient, these are 
not life threatening.   
 
The novelty of our pessary lies in its ability to f lex, which we hypothesize will make 
insertion and removal more comfortable for the subject.  Because it does not contain 
buttons, mechanism, or moving parts, it does not have mechanical features subject to 
failure.  The soft and pliable nature of the molde d silicon e should not be capable of 
pinching the vaginal epithelium when the study pessary is elongated for removal, but this 
metric will be followed.  
 
In common clinical practice, patients often use their pessaries continuously for 3 -6 
months without removal or medical evaluation.  Per our protocol, the Reia pessary is 
intended to be used for 3 months continuously, and each subject will be evaluated 1 -3 
weeks after the study pessary is initially placed to assess for the presence of adverse 
events.  Each subject will be a current pessary user, and during the course of the trial they 
will be monitored more closely than had they continued to use their existi ng pessary.  
 
15.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Subjects will not directly benefit from participation in this study.

16.0 Data Management and Confidentiality  
Each subject who has signed a consent form and entered the study will be assigned a 
random study 3 -digit number ( 001-999).  Data related to the study will either be recorded  
on data collection  forms  (see attached document)  or collected in R EDCap .  The case 
report forms will not contain unique identifiers  and will  be referenced back to subjects 
only using the assigned study numbers.  A separate key will be created linking the 
subjects with their random numbers. Once the key is created it will be kept secure with 
other study related documents (including, but not limited  to, the protocol, instructions for 
use, all versions of the consent form, etc.). These documents will be maintained by study 
personnel through the trial and for 2 years after termination of the study and will only be 
accessible by study personnel.  
 
Uniden tifiable data from the case report forms may be collated in spreadsheets for 
purposes of analysis. Such data will be stored and processed exclusively on password 
protected and encrypted computers.   
 
Confidentiality protections include confidentiality trai ning for all employees  and annual 
refresher seminars for all employees. Despite these protections, investigators will discuss 
with the eligible participants the potential for inadvertent disclosure of their data and 
ensure they are fully aware of these min imal, but possible risks. Breaches in 
confidentiality will be reported to WCG  IRB.  
 
Reia, LLC is partially funded by the NIH. Reia is subject to potential auditing at any time 
by the NIH or the FDA . Reia, LLC may be required to release data from this study  to 
these agencies if an audit were to be performed and this information were to be requested.  
The sponsor, monitors, auditors, the IRB, and the Food and Drug Administration will be 
granted direct access to subjects' medical records to conduct and oversee the research. 
Excluding this circumstance, Reia, LLC will not intentionally release  patient  information 
to any individual, agency, or entity.  
 
17.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Data Analysis and Data Monitoring  
This is a non -randomized, non -blinded, feasibility study involving a vaginal pessary. 
Given that the intervention  is known to be safe and well -tolerated and the total exposure 
to our pessary for each subject was chosen to be similar to the typical  interval  of 
continuous pessary us e which is common in clinical practice  for current pessary users, we 
don’t believe a formal data safety  monitoring committee  is required. However, a data and 
safety monitoring plan will be in place. The data safety monitoring plan will focus on low 
intensity monitoring by the Data Safety Monitoring Team, comprised of the one clinician 
from each participating  site and a bio statistician . The Data Safety Monitoring Team will 
meet monthly , or sooner if necessary .  Their charge will be to review subject accrual,

CONFIDENTIAL  
adherence to study protocol, and monitor adverse events. Additionally, they will ensure 
prompt reporting of serious adverse events to WCG  IRB and the study sponsor (Reia, 
LLC).  
 
At each contact with the subject, the clinical investigator will seek information on 
adverse events by specific questioning and by examination. Information on all adverse 
events will be recorded for review by the Data Safety Monitoring Team . Moderate 
adverse events which represent a change in baseline from those experienced in the 
washout period will be reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Team within one week. 
Serious adverse events, as defined by FDA criteria, will be reviewed by the Data Safety 
Monitoring Team within 24 hours and reported to WCG  IRB and the study sponsor 
(Reia, LLC). Careful monitoring of the recruitment, enrollment, study procedures, and 
adverse events will help protect the safety of the subjects and quality of the data.  
 
Any unanticipated adverse device effects that are p ossibly, probably, or definitely related 
to the study intervention will be immediately evaluated by the sponsor, Reia, LLC.  If it 
is determined that the adverse device effect presents an unreasonable risk to the subjects, 
the investigation will be termina ted within 5 working days of making the determination 
and not more than 15 working days of first receiving notice.  
 
In compliance with 21 CFR §812.46, if the sponsor, Reia, LLC, discovers that the study 
team is not complying with the signed agreement, the study protocol, applicable FDA 
regulations, or any conditions for approval of this IRB application, then Reia, LLC w ill 
either secure compliance or stop delivery of the device and terminate the investigator’s 
participation.  Additionally, Reia, LLC will require the remaining investigational devices 
be returned.  
 
Protection Against Risks  
The primary somatic risks for pa rticipating in this study are associated with either 
discomfort or with pathologic changes to the vagina.  Discomfort can occur with 
insertion, removal, unintentional expulsion  or with daily use. Per convention , each 
subject will be awake and unsedated while the study pessary is being fit and  will be able 
to communicate any discomfort experienced . A physical exam will be performed at each 
study visit . Pathologic changes to the vagina , which can be noted during these times , 
include vaginal ecchymoses, abrasions, superficial cuts, erosions, granulation tissue, or 
bleeding. Subject  reported adverse events include pelvic cramping or mild discomfort, 
copious vaginal discharge, urinary tract infection, urinary retention, substant ial 
discomfort, pessary expulsion (deployed or collapsed), pessary failure to deploy or 
collapse, or adverse events unrelated to the pessary or study visit.  
 
Each a dverse event will be classified as Grade 1 or mild (easily tolerated by the subject 
no inte rvention necessary), Grade 2 or moderate (causing discomfort or interrupting usual

CONFIDENTIAL  
activities), or Grade 3 or severe (causing considerable interference with usual activities, 
may be incapacitating, or may require hospitalization). Treatment of any adverse event, if 
indicated, will be coordinated by the member of the clinical study team who provides 
typical care for the study participant. Specific adverse events will be monitored as 
outlined in the  data and safety monitoring plan described in the above section . 
Additionally, the clinical research team will report any  Grade 1, Grade 2, or Grade 3  
adverse events that are unexpected and possibly, probably , or definitely  related to the  
research procedures within 5 working days to the study sponsor (Reia, LLC ) and WCG  
IRB. Grade 4 (life threating consequences requiring immediate intervention) and Grade 5 
(death related to adverse event) that are unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related 
to the intervention will terminate the study. These adverse even ts will be reviewed by the 
Data Safety Monitoring Team within 24 hours and repor ted to WCG IRB and the study 
sponsor (Reia, LLC).  
 
It is unlikely that an incidental finding will be discovered since the study population 
presents for similar care every 3 -4 months. In the event there is a finding, the member of 
the clinical research team who has been providing treatment for the subject will follow 
through to provide appropriate care or make appropriate referrals.  
 
The subject will have the opportunity to stop  the study at any point if desired.  The 
subject will be given a copy of the consent form which lists the telephone numbers for the 
nursing staff  and lead  investigator  at each site , as well as a 24 -hour telephone number for 
the on -call physician if concerns arise . 
 
No publication or public presentation about the research described above will reveal the 
subject's identity. Once data collected for this research study is no longer identifiable, the 
data may be used for other purposes. Protected health i nformation will be handled as 
described in “13.0 Recruitment Methods” and “17.0 Data Management and 
Confidentiality.”  
 
18.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
All subjects recruited for this study will have previously received outpatient c are for 
management of their pessary in the FPMRS division at their study site.   Upon arrival for 
a study visit, the subject  will be checked in for care in the standard manner  per existing 
clinical protocols designed to maintain privacy. T hey will then be brought to either a 
patient exam room or a private consultation room to meet with a member of the study 
team who will guide them through the study visit . Given the sensitive nature of  
conditions treated in the O b/Gyn department, all care is delivered in are as not accessible 
to the public. The bathrooms and exam rooms are private.  The study team is comprised 
of clinicians who are sub-specialty trained in FPMRS and facile at asking the questions 
and performing the procedures outlined in the study protocol .

19.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
As included in the attached consent form, if the subject develops an illness or sustains an 
injury due to the research study, the study sponsor (Reia, LLC) will pay for the 
reasonable costs of medical treatment.  Th e sponsor will not pay for:  
• Treatment of illness or injury that results from the negligence of a health care 
provider, or  
• Treatment of a condition the subject  had before they were in the study.  
 
The sponsor will not offer any other payments for study -related illness or injury such as 
lost wages, expenses other than medical care, or pain and suffering.  
 
20.0 Economic Burden to Subjects  
Participation in this study should not lead to additional cost for the subjects  beyond th e 
time and travel associated  with the  two additional visits  related  to study participation 
(Visit 1 and Visit 2) . Laboratory testing will not be performed nor are there reasonably 
anticipated events which will require additional care or follow up. As stated above, 
subjects  will be giv en three separate $100 gift cards for study partic ipation , one for each 
of the visits which occur in addition to routine care, and one at the conclusion of the 
study.   
 
21.0 Consent Process  
Process of Consent  
Each subject who presents for a study visit will be shown to a private room by a member 
of the clinical research unit or a member of the clinical study team.  The purpose of the 
study will be reviewed, and if the subject continues to be interested in participation , the 
informed consent process will begin .  Each subject will be given a copy of the consent 
form.  Based on their preference, the form will be read to them aloud or they can read it 
independently.  Each section will then be summarized; questions will be encouraged and 
answered fully.  The subjec t will then be asked to teach back the information presented in 
that section to ensure comprehension before moving on to the next section.  
 
The consent document will then be signed and dated by the subject providing consent and 
the person obtaining consent .  A copy of the consent document will be scanned into the 
subject’s medical record and a copy will be given to the subject.  The original will be 
kept in the locked cabinet with other research documents.  
 
As part of the process, subjects will be given as  much time as they need to decide on 
participation.  If they appear to be feeling pressure or need more time , they will not be 
enrolled in the study.  If at any point the subject indicates they do not want to take part in 
the research, the informed consent  process will be stopped.

Subject Capacity  
Potential subjects for recruitment to this study are known to the FPMRS clinical team and 
their baseline capacity is known. The subject will not be entered into the study if there is 
concern regarding capacity to  provide consent based on a change in function from 
previous encounters, or any of the following:  
• A diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment.  
• History of an evaluation of dementia since the last encounter in the FPMRS clinic.  
• A report, in medical records or from a family member or person well acquainted with 
the subject, that the subject has symptoms of cognitive impairment or dementia.  
• An abnormal degree of confusion, forgetfulness, or difficulties in communication that 
is ob served in the course of interacting with the subject.  
• Psychotic symptoms, bizarre or abnormal behavior exhibited by the subject.  
 
Subject Comprehension  
As described above, after the subject has read or been read the consent document, each 
section will ag ain be verbally reviewed and summarized.  In this step, comprehension 
will be determined by a “teach back” method.  
 
 
22.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
The informed consent process will begin when the subject agrees to take part in the study 
and end w hen the consent process is documented in writing.  The consent form (see 
attached) has been written in understandable language and has signature blocks for the 
printed name , signature , and date for both the subject and the person obtaining consent 
(the pri nciple investigator, co -investigator, research assistant, or coordinator ). The subject 
will receive a photocopied version . 
 
 
23.0 Multi -Site Research  
There will be at least  50 participants recruited for this study across all sites. All subjects 
will be identified using the methods described in “12.0 Recruitment Methods,”  and 
recruited using the same phone script (submitted separately  for review), with site specific 
informatio n substituted as indicated.  
 
The investigator teams across all sites and sponsor will meet as a group to review the 
consent form, protocol, instructions for use, data collection form, and phone script prior 
to commencing the study. The sponsor will additi onally visit each site to train the 
practitioners and set up the study materials in the designated locations.  Each member of 
the team will have adequate time to review the documentation and the opportunity to ask 
questions to the sponsor and principal inv estigator, and then sign a training log to 
document this process. During this meeting, the Principal Investigator will also assign

duties and functions to each member of the team .  Monthly research video 
teleconferences will be held  between the Sponsor, the Principal  Investigator, and the 
study sites  to review progress in executing  the study, as well as to communicate 
successes and challenges. Additionally, the sponsor will communicate directly with each 
study site on an ad hoc  basis  to coordinate changes in the protocol , consent forms,  other 
study related document s, or other information necessary for subject safety or study 
execution.

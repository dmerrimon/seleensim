 Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Patients will receive ciprofloxacin 250 mg , to be taken by mouth twice daily for 3 days.  
 
Formulation and Packaging:  
The site In vestigator or designee will provide the patient with either a pharmacy prescription or a supply for a 3 day (250 mg 
BID) course of generic ciprofloxacin for the treatment of their uUTI. The generic ciprofloxacin will be supplied by a local 
pharmacy, in the  form of a filled prescription, that includes 6 - 250 mg tablets of ciprofloxacin.   
Preparation and Dispensing : 
All generic ciprofloxacin will be prepared and provided to the patient via a prescribing pharmacy prescription, or, provided by 
the Investigator  or designee.   
 
Administration : 
The patient will receive one 3 -day treatment course of generic ciprofloxacin, with instructions to take one tablet or capsule of 
oral ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily beginning day 1 through 3 (+ 1 day).   
In the event a patient’s first dose is taken in the PM on Day 1, the patient will be expected to take an AM dose on Day 4 to 
receive the 6 doses of ciprofloxacin, and the EOT visit will occur on day 4 instead of day 3.

 General Statistical Co nsiderations:    
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and the numbers, means, standard 
deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided.  Comparisons will be made 
between response rates for patients with infection due to ciprofloxacin- susceptible and ciprofloxacin -non-susceptible isolates.  
Exploratory analyses may also be performed.  Listings of individual patient’s data will be produced.  
 
Efficacy Analyses:    
The study  is designed to determine the clinical and microbiologic response of patie nts with a uUTI, due to ciprofloxacin-
sensitive and ciprofloxacin- non-susceptible isolates, treated with ciprofloxacin  for the outcome measure of overall response 
(combined clinical  and microbiologic response ) at Day 12 (+/- 1 day) .  
A patient will be defined as a responder if the following criteria are met:  
• The patient is alive  
• The patient has received no rescue therapy for uUTI  
- If an antibiotic  active against the urinary tract patho gen is given for other reasons, then the patient will be 
considered indeterminate, and analyzed as a non -responder for uUTI  
• The patient has r esolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry and no new uUTI symptoms  
• Urine culture taken on Day 12 (+/ - 1 day) demonstrates  <103 CFU/mL  of the baseline uropathogen   
 
All other patients will be considered non -responders. If data are unavailable to determine if the patient is a responder or 
non-responder, the patient will be considered an indeterminate response.  
 
The number and percentage of responders , non- responders  and indeterminates will be determined. Descriptive statistics, 
including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and the numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, 
minimums, a nd maximums for continuous variables will be provided. In addition to the randomized m -MITT population, 
additional analyses will be performed in the subset of patients with ciprofloxacin -susceptible organisms at baseline  and in

 those with ciprofloxacin -non-susceptible organisms at baseline . Exploratory analyses may also be performed. Listings of 
individual patient’s data will be produced. A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to the 
database lock . 
 
The number and percentage  of patients with a microbiologic success at the Day 12 (+/ -1 day ) visit will be determined. The 
validity of the urine dipstick as a screening tool to identify patients with a positive urine culture will be evaluated by 
calculating the percentage of patien ts with  both a positive nitrite test and a positive test for pyuria on dipstick/urinalysis, who 
have ≥ 105 CFU/ml of a uropathogen isolated from urine culture.  Safety analyses will be conducted in all patients who receive 
any amount of ciprofloxacin .  Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs .

 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Indication  
Ciprofloxacin is being studied for the treatment of the following indications: 
 
- Uncomplicated urinary tract infections  
 
 
1.2 Background and Rationale  
1.2.1  Rationale for Study  
ß-lactam antimicrobials are  widely recognized for their efficacy and low toxicity and form  the cornerstone of therapy for the treatment 
of infections caused by gram -positive and gram -negative bacteria. However, extensive use of ß -lactams during the past 50 years has  
resulted in the development of microbial resistance to these agents among clinically  important bacteria. This resistance commonly 
takes the form of ß -lactamase production , development of porins  or alterations in penicillin -binding proteins (PBPs). Such 
mechanisms have red uced the clinical  utility of frequently prescribed ß- lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanate  (a ß-
lactamase inhibitor), and cephalosporins. For Escherichia coli , ampicillin resistance has risen to ≥50% in high- risk populations, and 
resist ance to third generation cephalosporins is now being seen in certain areas.  Furthermore, th e prevalence of infections caused by 
extended -spectrum β -lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae has been increasing worldwide. An analysis of data reported 
from 2011 to 2014 to the National Healthcare Safety Network performed by the Centers for Disease Control in March 2016 reveale d 
that the proportion of E.  coli resistant to extended -spectrum cephalosporins causing hospital -acquired infection was 13.4% nationally, 
with rates as high as 24% reported in some Northeastern, Southern and Western states.  The same analysis also demonstrated that over 
a third of E.  coli isolates in 2014 were resistant to fluoro quinolones. Data reported by the European Antimicrobial R esistance 
Surveillance Network (EARS -NET) in Europe demonstrate that the prevalence of fluoro quinolone resistant E.  coli and E.  coli resistant 
to third -generation cephalosporins is > 25% and E.  coli resistant to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycos ides and 
fluoro quinolones has increased to >10% in some southern and eastern European countries. Oral antibiotic treatment options are 
extremely limited for patients with these infections, resulting in lengthy hospital stays to facilitate administration of  intravenous 
antibiotics, even for those with uncomplicated infections. The currently available oral antibiotics with activity against ESB L

 producing organisms include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, fluoro quinolones and trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole. Nitrofur antoin and 
fosfomycin are only approved for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the United States, have rising ra tes of 
resistance and are associated with inferior efficacy  [Munoz -Davila 2014; Schito 2009] . Resistance to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole 
is uniformly above 20% in the US. Increasing prevalence of resistance to fluoro quinolones and their propensity to cause collateral 
damage resulted in relegation of fluoro quinolones to second- line therapy by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for 
UTI [Gupta 2011] .  Even with these limitations, almost two -thirds of patients with a uUTI receive therapy with a fluoroquinolone 
antibiotic.  Furthermore, there is a percentage of uUTI patients treated with a fluoroquinolone who respond to therapy despite 
predicted failure based upon the results of in vitro susceptibility testing. The reason for this is likely multifactorial, including PK/PD 
relationships (i.e., concentration and duration of drug at the site of infection) and host fact ors.  The proportion of patients with 
infection due to fluoroquinolone resistant pathogens who have clinical or bacteriological response to fluoroquinolone therapy  has not 
been well studied, and most studies which have evaluated this issue have done so as part of a secondary analysis of a UTI treatment 
trial. 
 
1.2.2  Dose Rationale  
Ciprofloxacin  
The recommended dose  of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI is  250 mg twice daily by mouth for 3 days, per the 
Ciprofloxacin USPI  and Ciprofloxacin SmPC .  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Objective s 
The primary objective of this study is t o evaluate the clinical and microbiologic response of patients with a uUTI treated with 
ciprofloxacin.     
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the validity of specific t ests found on the urine dipstick as a screening tool to

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This prospective , Phase 4 , open label, multi -center study docum ents the clinical and microbiologic response of adult women patients 
with uUTI treated empirically with ciprofloxacin.   Since UTIs in males are classified as complicated, males will not be included in 
this study. Approximately 250 adult women with uUTI wi ll receive oral ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for 3 days.  
The primary outcome measure for efficacy evaluation will be the overall response on Day 12 (+/ - 1 day).  For the primary efficacy 
evaluation, these percentages will be based on a microbiologic -modified intent to treat population (m -MITT). The m -MITT population 
will be comprised of all patients who received at least one dose of ciprofloxacin  and had ≥105 CFU/mL  of a baseline pathogen isolated 
from a urine culture specimen taken at baseline , prior to initiation of ciprofloxacin therapy.  
 
See Appendix 1, Schedule of Activities Table.  
 
3.1 Investigational Study Medications  
Patients w ho present with uUTI symptoms, have a urine dipstick analysis positive for both leukocyte ester ase AND nitrite  who meet 
all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, and who agree to participate in the study, w ill be treated for their uUTI with 
ciprofloxacin .   
The ciprofloxacin , or a pharmacy prescription for ciprofloxacin, will be provi ded to the patient by the enrolling study site.   
Patients will be asked to take one 250 mg tablet or capsule twice daily ( day 1 to 3 + 1 day)  for 3 days .  In the event a patient’s first 
dose is taken in the PM on Day 1, the patient will be expected to take  an AM dose on Day 4 to complete the 6 doses of ciprofloxacin, 
and the EOT visit will occur on day 4 instead of day 3.

5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Allocation to Treatment  
This is a non- randomized, open label , multi- center  study of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of uUTI. Approximate ly 250 female 
patients with uUTI will be administered  oral ciprofloxacin twice daily for 3 days . Patients who withdraw prior to initial dose, will be 
replaced to ensure all 250 patients have received at least a single- dose of ciprofloxacin. 
 
A patient will be eligible for the study once it  has been determined that she  meets all inclusion criteria and has none of the exclusion 
criteria.  
 
5.2 Drug Supplies  
5.2.1  Formulation and Packaging 
The site Investigator or designee will provide the patient with a pharmacy prescr iption or a supply for a 3 day  (250 mg BID) course of 
generic ciprofloxacin for the treatment of their uUTI.

Confidential   
Page 24 of 60 
 5.2.2     Preparation and Dispensing  
The patient will receive one 3 -day treatment course of generic ciprofloxacin, with instructions to take one ta blet or capsule of oral 
ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily beginning day 1 through 3 (+ 1 day).   
In the event a patient’s first dose is taken in the PM on Day 1, the patient will be expected to take an AM dose on Day 4 to receive the 
6 doses of ciprofloxaci n, and the EOT visit will occur on day 4 instead of day 3.  
5.2.3  Compliance  
All patients should be informed that compliance with taking all oral medication  
as instructed is imperative. A site designee will phone the patient or the pharmacy on Day 1 to ensure tha t the prescription of 
ciprofloxacin was picked up and the first dose was taken.  This phone call should be documented in the patient's source  and include 
the date and estimated time the patient took the initial dose . 
Patients will receive a dosing diary on  Day 1 and asked to record the dosing administration for the duration of the treatment period.  
The total amount of oral dosing completed during the treatment period will be documented in the CRF.  
5.3 Drug Storage and Drug Accountability  
Drug should be store d by the patient according to the guidance provided by the site or pharmacy . For drug accountability, the site will 
provide the patient with a diary to collect daily ingestion of ciprofloxacin.  The patient should return the diary to the cli nic along with 
the prescription bottle/container after completion of their ciprofloxacin course of treatment. Site staff will keep diary in source and 
record  in the  CRF.

 5.4 Medication(s), Adjunctive Therapy and Non-drug Therapy  
5.4.1  Concomitant Medications  
Any medication taken by the patient, other than ciprofloxacin, is considered a concomitant medication.  Any concomitant medication 
which is administered from Screening through the TOC Visit must be recorded in the patient's source record.    
Any concomitant medication which is  an antibiotic, administered for the treatment of the primary uUTI, should also be recorded i n the 
CRF.  No other concomitant medications need to be recorded in the CRF.  
At each visit,  the Investigator  or site designee will obtain information on any therapeutic interventions (e.g., drug and non -drug 
therapy, surgery, etc.) provided.  The use of any investigational drug is prohibited and patients may not participate in any other studies 
involving other marketed products concomitantly while in this study.   
The use of other (non- antibacterial) medications should be limited to those essential for the care of the patient.  All medications 
required by the patient to manage underlying illnesses, other than the infection under study, and any drugs that may be requi red for 
emergency treatments must be recorded in the source document .   
The bioavailability of ciprofloxacin is significantly reduced when co- administered with magnesium or aluminum containing antacids. 
As a result, co -administration of these antacids with ciprofloxacin is not permitted.  
Dosing with food does not affect the overall absorption of ciprofloxacin. 
5.4.2  Concomitant Antibacterial Medications  
Concomitant systemic antibacterials are prohibited during the study, up to the TOC visit, unless it has been de termined that the 
antibacterial would not have a potential effect on outcome evaluations in patients with uUTI.  
5.4.3  Non-drug Adjunctive Therapy  
None allowed

 6.3.2  Post Test of Cure (TOC) Day  21 (+/ - 3 days)  
Call patient to assess for resolution of uUTI symptoms  
 
6.4 Patient Withdrawal from Treatment or Study  
Patients may withdraw from the study or ciprofloxacin  at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the 
discretion of the Investigator or Iterum Therapeutics  for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons.   
If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the patient.  In any circumstance, ever y effort 
should be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  If the patient withdraws or is withdrawn from ciprofloxacin  treatment, t he 
Investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal , request  the patient to return for all protocol -specified assessments, if 
possible, and follow -up with the patient regarding a ny unresolved AEs through the TOC . 
If the patient withdraw s from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further study -specific 
evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.  Iterum Therapeutics  may retain and continue to use any 
data collected  before such withdrawal of consent.

 7.2 Efficacy 
7.2.1  Overall Response  
Overall  Response is assessed  on Day 12 (+/ - 1 day) TOC  using the definitions listed below: 
 
A patient will be defined as a responder if the following criteria are met (programmatically, based on the data on the CRF) : 
• The patient is alive  
• The patient has received no rescue therapy for uUTI  
- If an antibiotic  active against the urinary tract pathogen is given for other reasons, then the patient will be considered 
indeterminate, and analyzed as a non- responder for uUTI  
• The patient has resolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry and no new uUTI symptoms  
• Urine culture taken on Day 12 (+/- 1 day) demonstrates < 103 CFU /mL of the baseline uropatho gen 
All other patients will be considered non -responders . If data are unavailable to determine if the patient is a responder or non-
responder, the patient will be considered as having an indeterminate response.  
 
7.2.2  Microbiologic  
Microbiologic Response is assessed on Day 3 or 4 (+1 day) EOT and Day 12 (+/ - 1 day) TOC using the definitions  listed below:

 Microbiological response  Definition  
Eradication  A urine culture taken at baseline and compared with the culture from the EOT 
visit or TOC visit showed that the urine culture obtained at the relevant visit 
demonstrated <103 CFU/mL of the original uropathogen.  
Persistence  A uropathogen present at baseline  grew at ≥103 CFU/m L at the time -point of 
analysis, i.e. EOT  or TOC.  
Indeterminate  Patient was lost to follow -up or an assessment was not undertaken such that no 
urine culture was obtained (or culture results could not be interpreted for any 
reason) at either the EOT or the  TOC visit . 
 
7.2.3  Investigator -Determined Clinical Response  
Investigators will use the definitions below to document clinical response at Day 3  or 4 (+ 1 day)  (EOT) and Day 1 2 (+/ - 1 day)

7.2.4  Other Assessments  
Patients will score their symptoms and record them on a Patient Symptom Assessment Questionnaire ( Appendix 3) . 
8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 
8.1 Adverse Events 
All observed or volunteered AEs , regardless of suspected causal relationship , will be reported as described in the following sections.  
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess 
whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious AE  (SAE) requiring immediate notification to Iterum Therapeutics .  For all 
AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigator to determine the causality of the AE.  The Investigator is requi red 
to assess causality.  All AEs will be followed- up by the Investigator until the event or its sequel ae resolve or stabilize at a level 
acceptable to the Investigator, and Iterum concurs with that assessment.  
8.2 Reporting Period  
Adverse events will be colle cted from the time that the patient provides informed consent  through TOC .

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT-004-401   Amendment 02: 27March 2018 
 
 
 
Confidential   
Page 32 of 60 
 For SAEs, the reporting period to Iterum Therapeutics  begins from the time that the patient signed informed consent , which may be 
prior to the patient’s participation in the study, i.e., prior to undergoing any study -related procedure through the TOC .   Any SAE 
occurring any time after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a causal relationship to investigational product i s suspected  
All AEs should be recorded on the CRF  if they occur from the time the patient provides informed consent  through TOC . 
8.3 Definition of an AE  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a product or medical device , unless the 
event is captured in the s tudy endpoint, as defined below ; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.   
An event would be considered as adequately captured in the study endpoint if it is accurately and fully represented by a prot ocol-
defined reason for clinical failure (other than mortality) or relapse.  Such an event should not be reported as an adverse event unless it 
is a serious adverse event as defined in this protocol.   
Events represented by the study endpoints include  all of the fo llowing:  
• Symptoms of uUTI have not resolved from Baseline to such an extent that new antibiotics are not needed for the infection under 
study  
• Development of new uUTI symptoms not present at Baseline  
• Follow up urine cultures do not reveal eradication of causative uropathogen   
 
Except for circumstances as defined above, examples of AEs include but are not limited to:   
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs; 
• Hypersensitivity;  
• Progression/worsening of underlying disease .  
 
Additionally, they may include the  signs or symptoms resulting from:

 • Drug overdose;  
• Drug withdrawal; 
• Drug abuse;  
• Drug misuse;  
• Drug interactions; 
• Drug dependency;  
• Exposure during Pregnancy . 
 
8.4 Abnormal Test Findings  
No additional laboratory testing will be performed beyond urine testing for uUTI.  
8.5 SAEs  
An SAE or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity;  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is assessed as being a medically important event based on medical and scientific judgment.  Such medically important events ma y 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or  convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

8.6 Hospitalization  
Adverse events associated with hospitalization are considered serious.  Admission also includes transfer within the hospital  (e.g., from 
the psychiatric wing to a medical floor).  
Hospitalization does not include the following:  
• Rehabilitation facilities; 
• Hospice facilities; 
• Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief);  
• Skilled nursing facilities; 
• Nursing homes;  
• Routine emergency room e valuation;  
• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).  
 
Hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated wit h the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the 
preexisting condition (e.g., for work- up of persistent pre -treatment lab oratory  abnormality);  
• Social admission (e.g., patient has no place to sleep);  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physic al exam);  
• Protocol -specified admission during a study (e.g., for a procedure required by the study protocol);  
• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (e.g., for elective cosmetic surgery).  Pre -planned treatments or 
surgical proc edures should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;  
• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.

Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surger y, should not be reported as an AE.  However, the 
medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an 
acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be repor ted as the AE and the resulting appendectomy should be 
recorded as treatment of the AE.  
8.7 Severity Assessment 
The Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  For 
purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
• MILD :  Does not interfere with the patient's usual function. 
• MODERATE :  Interferes to some extent with the patient's usual function.  
• SEVERE:  Interferes significantly with the patient's usual function.   
 
Note the di stinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe event is not necessarily a serious event.  
For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as  serio us 
unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.  
 
8.8 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non- serious); the Investigator must record the 
causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 
requirements if applicable.  An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility 
that th e cipro floxacin  caused or contributed to an AE.  If the Investigator does not know whether or not ciprofloxacin  caused the event, 
then the event will be handled as “related to ciprofloxacin ” for reporting purposes, as defined by Iterum Therapeutics  (see Section  8.12 
on Reporting Requirements ).  If the Investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to ciprofloxacin ", this should be 
clearly documented on study records.  Specifically, the Investigator will choose whether the AE is unrelated, unlikely related, possibly 
related or probably related to ciprofloxacin .

 In addition, if the Investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the Investigator must record this causal 
relationship in the source docume nts and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.  
The Investigator will assess causal ity of the event in relation to ciprofloxacin  based on the following defined criteria:  
• UNRELATE D: No relationship between the event and medicinal product  
• UNLIKELY:  Event with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible); Disease or other drugs 
provide plausible explanations  
• POSSIBLY : Event with reasonable time rela tionship to drug intake; Could also be explained by disease or other drugs; 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear  
• PROBABLY:  Event with reasonable time relationship to drug intake; Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs; Response 
to withdrawal clinically reasonable; Re -challenge not required  
 
8.9 Exposure during Pregnancy  
Ciprofloxacin is Pregnancy Category C , indicating that there are no adequate and well -controlled studies of ciprofloxacin in pregnant 
women. C iprofloxacin should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to both fetus and 
mother. An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy by TERIS –the Teratogen 
Information System– concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk, but the data 
are insufficient to state that there is no risk.   
 
If any study patient becomes  or is found to be pregnant during the study , patient’s treatment with  ciprofloxacin , the investigator must 
complete a Med Watch  Form FDA 3500 and submit it by email to Iterum Therapeutics .   The decision to continue ciprofloxacin, stop 
ciprofloxacin , or switch to an alternative agent will be left to the discretion of the Investigator .

 Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Pregnancy  reports with an unknown outcome.  The 
investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination (i.e., induced abortion) and then not ify Iterum  
of the outcome.   
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e.,  spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an 
 aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonata l death]), Iterum  Therapeutics will 
submit the Med  Watch Form FDA 3500 to the FDA and to the manufacturer of ciprofloxacin.  
 
8.10 Discontinuation from Ciprofloxacin Due to AEs (See also Patient Withdrawal, Section  6.4) 
Discontinuation from ciprofloxacin  due to an AE should be distinguished from discontinuation due to insufficient response, according 
to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page.   
When a patient discontinues ciprofloxacin  due to an SAE, the SAE must be repor ted in accordance with the reporting requirements 
defined below.  
8.11 Eliciting AE Information  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study patient  from informed consent 
through the TOC .  In addition, e ach study patient will be questioned about the occurrence of any AEs.  
8.12 Reporting Requirements  
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If an SAE occurs that is considered by the Investigator or 
Iterum Therapeutics  to be at least possibly related to ciprofloxacin , the Investigator must complete a Med  Watch Form FDA 3500 and 
submit it by email to Iterum Therapeutics  who will then submit the Med  Watch Form FDA 3500 to the FDA and to the manufacturer 
of ciprofloxacin.

 8.12.1  SAE Re porting Requirements  
If an SAE or exposure during pregnancy occurs, Iterum Therapeutics  is to be notified within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the 
Investigator  on a  Med Watch Form FDA 3500.  If the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Iterum must be made 
immediately, irrespective of the extent of available event  information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information 
(follow -up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of Preg nancy cases.   
In the rare instance that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study 
patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator is to report the event within 24 hour s after learning of it and document the 
time of his/her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAEs and  pregnancies , the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Iterum Therapeutics in accordance 
with the timeframes for reporting specified abov e.  In addition, an Investigator may be requested by Iterum Therapeutics  to obtain 
specific additional follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  This information may be more detailed than that captured on the 
Med Watch Form FDA 3500.  In general, thi s information may include hospital discharge summary, laboratory test and X -ray results .  
Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided.  In the ca se of a 
patient death, a summary of avail able autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible by email to Iterum Therapeutics .  The 
information should be reported on a  Med Watch Form FDA 3500 and sent  to Iterum Therapeutics.  
8.12.2  Non-SAE Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the A E page(s) of the CRF.  Please note that while all AEs are reported on the AE page of the CRF, there 
is an additional form used for collection of SAE information, as described in Section  8.12.1, which is not the same as the AE C RF.  
Whe n the same data are collected, the two forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should 
be used on both forms.  Serious a dverse events  should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the 
form for collection of SAE information.  The information on the AE CRF and the SAE form must be the same and will be reconciled 
at defined periods throughout the study to ensure that they do.

 8.12.3  Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
Adverse event reporting, including reporting of suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with 
applicable local regulations.  Death and life -threatening Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) are subject to 
expedited reporting within a 7 calendar day (life -threatening and fatal) or 15 calendar day (all other SUSARs) timeframe.   
  
9 DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
The study is designed to determine the clinical and microbiolog ic efficacy of ciprofloxacin for adult female patients with uUTI, due to 
either a ciprofloxacin susceptible or non- susceptible  organism . Two -hundred fifty ( 250) symptomatic patients will be enrolled with the 
expectation that there will be no screen failures .  Of the 250 enrolled patients, we expect 50 will not have a positive urine culture for 
≥105 CFU/mL of a uropathogen at baseline .   Of the 250 enrolled patients, we expect 40 will have a uUTI due to a ciprofloxacin non-
susceptible organism.  
 
Patients wh o withdraw prior to initial dose, will be replaced to ensure all 250 patients have received at least a single -dose of 
ciprofloxacin.   
 
 
 
9.2 Definition of Analysis Populations  
1. Intent -to-Treat ( ITT): all randomized patients  regardless of whether or not the pat ient received ciprofloxacin  
2. Modified ITT  (MITT) : randomized patients who received a t least a single -dose of ciprofloxacin  
3. Safety : randomized patients who received any amount of  ciprofloxacin

 4. Micro -MITT (mMITT) : All MITT patients with a positive study entry  urine culture defined as ≥105 CFU/mL of a 
uropathogen and no more than 2 species of microorganisms identified in the study entry urine culture, regardless of colony 
count.  
5. Clinically evaluable:  
1)  Clinically evaluable (CE) at the EOT and TOC visits popu lation:  
a) Received a minimum number of days of ciprofloxacin  (to be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP])  
b) Had no important protocol deviations that would affect the assessment of efficacy  (to be defined in the SAP)  
c) Had an  outcome assessment of cl inical cure or failure (and not indeterminate) at the EOT,  or TOC visits ( i.e., within the 
protocol allowed visit window), respectively.   
d) Had not received prior antibiotic before the initiation of study therapy for this infection unless the recovered path ogen 
demonstrates resistance to initial antibiotic and clinical symptoms persist  
e) Did not receive any antibiotic therapy with potential activity against any of the baseline uropathogens collected at 
screening between the time of the baseline culture and the EOT or TOC culture, respectively.  This excludes the protocol 
defined study therapy and patients who were considered clinical failures and required additional antibiotic therapy.  
Patients with a coinfection with a gram -positive uropathogen resistant to c iprofloxacin are allowed to receive agents with 
narrow spectrum gram -positive coverage ( i.e., such as linezolid or vancomycin)  
f) Had a study entry urine culture obtained before ciprofloxacin  administration   
 
2) Microbiologically evaluable (ME):  all patients in cluded in both the micro -mITT and CE  populations at the  (ME -EOT ), 
and at the TOC visit (ME -TOC) and have an appropriately collected urine culture specimen and interpretable urine culture 
result a t the EOT, and TOC visits, respectively.

 9.3 General Statis tical Considerations  
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and the numbers, means, standard deviations, 
medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided.  Comparisons will be made between response rates for 
patients with infection due to ciprofloxacin- susceptible and ciprofloxacin -non-susceptible isolates.  Exploratory analyses may also be 
performed.  Listings of individual patient’s data will be produced. A comprehensive Statistical  Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized 
prior to final database lock . 
 
9.4 Patient Characteristics  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, discontinuations from the ciprofloxacin  and withdrawal from the study will be summarized.  
Demographics (age, race, sex), medical  and surgi cal history , baseline assessment of the symptoms of uUTI , microbiological 
assessment of the urine , and ciprofloxacin  administration will also be summarized.     
 
9.5 Efficacy Analysis  
9.5.1  Analysis of Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary outcome is overall  response (clinical plus microbiologic) at the Day 12 (+/ - 1 day) visit in the m -MITT population. The 
number a nd percentage of responders, non- responders  and indeterminates  will be determined.   
 
9.5.1.1  Additional Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Outcome  
In addit ion to the overall response rate, response rates for patients infected by ciprofloxacin susceptible and non- susceptible organism 
will be evaluated.

Page 42 of 60 
 9.5.2  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Outcome  Measure  
All symptomatic subjects enrolled in the study will have a  positive urine dipstick for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite.  The number 
and percentage of subjects who go on to have a positive baseline urine culture for >100,000 CFU/mL of a uropathogen will be  
evaluated .  
 
9.5.3  Analysis of Additional Efficacy Outcome M easures 
The number and percentage of subjects tre ated with ciprofloxacin with an overall response of responder, non- responder, and 
indeterminate (by definition subjects with an indeterminate response are excluded the ME population) at the TOC visit will be  
presented for the m -MITT and ME -TOC popul ations.   
Investigator determined clinical response (clinical cure, failure and indeterminate) at the Day 3  or 4 (+ 1 day)  (EOT ) and TOC Visits 
will be presented for the m -MITT, CE, and ME populations.  The number and percentage of subjects with a microbiologic response 
of eradication, persistence, persistence with in creasing MIC, and indeterminate (by definition subjects with an indeterminate response 
are excluded from the ME populations) will be presented for the following time points and analysis populations:  
• Day 3  or 4 (+ 1 day)  (EOT)  in the m -MITT and ME- EOT populations  
• Day 12 in the m -MITT  and ME -Day12  populations  
Overall response and microbiologic eradication at the EOT and TOC visits by baseline pathogen (key  pathogens) will be summarized 
in the m -MITT and ME populations.  
9.6 Safety Analyses  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs.  All safety analyses will be based on the Safety population.   
Summary tables of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be provided.  A TEAE is any AE that newly appeared, increased in 
frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of ciprofloxacin .  The  incidence of TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ 
   Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.

 class and preferred term, and by severity and relationship to trea tment.  Tables of TEAEs leading to ciprofloxacin  discontinuation, 
withdrawal from the study or an SAE will be provided.  AEs occurring prior to the first dose of c iprofloxacin  (AEs are recorded from 
the time of informed consent)  will be provided in a listing.  
9.7 Handling of Missing Data  
Details of the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP.  For the primary and secondary efficacy analyses, if any  data 
field needed to determine overall response (primary) and microbiological response (secondary) is  missing at the Day 12 (primary) 
visit, the patient will be considered an indeterminate response. By definition, patients with an indeterminate response are included 
in the denominator in the m -MITT population and thus, are analyzed in the same manner as non- responders  and persistence.   
Additional sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be detailed in the SAP.  By definition, patients with missing data are 
excluded from the CE  populations . 
 
10 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
During study conduct, Iterum  or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the protocol and GCPs are being 
followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The Investigator and 
institution w ill allow Iterum  monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform 
this verification.  
The study site may be subject to review by the institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC ), and/or to quality 
assurance audits performed by Iterum , or companies working with or on behalf of Iterum , and/or to inspection by appropriate 
regulatory authorities.  
It is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available dur ing the monitoring visits and possible audits or 
inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

 11 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
11.1 Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refe r to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, 
depending on the data collection method used in this study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed original CRFs are the sole property of Iterum  
and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Iterum  or appropriate regulatory 
authorities, without written permission from Iterum . 
The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, and timely collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, 
laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms.  The CRFs must be signed by the Investigator or by an 
authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on  the CRFs are true.  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs and 
source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the physician' s patient chart.  In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must 
match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these cases, a document should be available at 
the Investigator’s site as  well as at Iterum  and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will 
stand as the source document. 
11.2 Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Iterum , the Investigator agree s to keep records, including the 
identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records ), all original signed 
informed consent forms , copies of all CRFs, SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and 
adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone call reports).  The records should be 
retained by the Investigator according to ICH, local regulations, or as specified in the C linical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT-004-401   Amendment 02: 27March 2018 
 
 
 
Confidential   
Page 45 of 60 
 If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (e.g., retirement, 
relocation), Iterum  should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Iterum , such as 
another Investigator, another institution, or to Iterum .  The Investigator must obtain Iterum 's written permission before disposing of 
any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
12 ETHICS  
12.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent 
forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., recruitme nt advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should be forwarded to Iterum  or its agent  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be  initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Iterum  in writing 
immediately after the implementation.  
12.2 Ethic al Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involvi ng 
Human Patients, adopted by the General Assembly of the World Medical Association ( 2013).  
In addition, the stud y will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guideline on Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.  
12.3 Patient Information and Consent  
All parties will ensu re protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names on any sponsor forms, reports, 
publications, or in any other disclosures, except where required by laws.  In case of data transfer, Iterum  will maintain high standards 
of confidentia lity and protection of patient personal data.

Page 46 of 60 
 The informed consent form must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. 
The informed consent form used in this study, and any changes made during the course of the s tudy, must be prospectively approved 
by both the IRB/IEC and Iterum  before use.  
The Investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his/her legally acceptable representative, is fully informed about the nature 
and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation.  The Investigator, or a person designated by the 
Investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative before  any study-
specific activity is performed.  The Investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent form.  
Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP  
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (i.e., clinical hold) by an applicable Compet ent Authority in any area of the 
World, or if the Investigator is aware of any new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, Iterum  should be informed immediately.   
In addition, the Investigator will inform Iterum  immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by the Investigator to protect the 
study patients against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the Investigator becomes 
aware of.  
13 DEFINITION OF END OF STUDY 
13.1 End of Study in Participating Countries  
End of Study in all participating countries is defined as the TOC  Visit. 
 
14 SPONSOR STUDY TERMINATION CRITERIA  
Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug 
safety problems, or at the discretion of Iterum .

If a study is prematurely terminated, Iterum  will promptly notify the Investigator and the Investigator must also inform the IRB/IEC.  
After notification, the Investigator must contact all participating patients and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 90  days.  
Investigator must also inform the IRB/IEC.  As directed by Iterum , all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to 
the great est extent possible.  
15 PUBLICATION OF STUDY  RESULTS  
Publication of study results is discussed in the Clinical Study Agreement.  
15.1 Communication of Results by Iterum  
Iterum  fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose the results of studies through registration and posting of the results of this study on 
clinicaltrials.gov .   
If posting of study results to clinicaltrials.gov jeopardizes a planned publication of the study results, a Pending Full Publication notice 
is substituted for the synopsis until the study re sults publication has been issued or 2 years have elapsed, whichever occurs first.  
15.2 Publications by Investigators  
Iterum  has no objection to publication by the Investigator of any information collected or generated by the Investigator, however, to 
ensure a gainst inadvertent disclosure of Confidential Information or unprotected Inventions, the Investigator will provide Iterum  an 
opportunity to review any proposed publication or other type of disclosure before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed.  
The Inves tigator will provide manuscripts, abstracts, or the full text of any other intended disclosure (poster presentation, invited 
speaker or guest lecturer presentation, etc.) to Iterum  at least 30  days before they are submitted for publication or otherwise dis closed.  
If any patent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, the Investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for  a period not to 
exceed an additional 60  days.

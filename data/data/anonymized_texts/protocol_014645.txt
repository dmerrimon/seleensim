Title An Open Label Phase 3 Trial to  Evaluate the Safety of ALD403 
Administered Intravenously in Patients with Chronic Migraine 
Sponsor Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alder)
Investigational Product ALD403, a humanized anti-(calcitonin gene-related peptide) 
(CGRP) monoclonal antibody
Safety Objective To evaluate the long te rm safety of repeat doses of ALD403 
administered intravenously (IV) in chronic migraine (CM) 
patients.
Immunogenicity and Patient Reported OutcomesTo evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of repeat doses of ALD403 administere d IV to patients with chronic 
migraine.To further evaluate the impact  of ALD403 on various patient 
reported outcomes.
Methodology This is an open label trial in which 120 eligible subjects will 
receive infusions of ALD403.  The trial will include two 
treatment phases.  The primar y treatment phase will include 4
ALD403 infusions 12 weeks apart.  The secondary treatment phase will include 4 additional ALD403 infusions 12 weeks
apart.
In the primary treatment phase, visits will occur on Day 0, Weeks 
2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 and subjects will receive 4 IV infusions of ALD403 on Days 0, Weeks 12, 24, and 36.
Subjects who receive all 4 infusions of ALD403 in the primary 
treatment phase may enter the secondary treatment phase. In the secondary treatment phase, su bjects will receive up to 4 
additional IV infusions of ALD403 for a total of 8 infusions. 
Visits and ALD403 IV infusions will occur on Weeks 48, 60, 72, 
and 84. Subjects will be followe d for 20 weeks until Week 104 
for a total study duration of approximately 106 weeks, including the screening period. 
Subjects who don’t receive all 4 infusions of ALD403 in the 
primary treatment phase or don’t c onsent for participation in the 
secondary treatment phase will be followed at Week 48 and
Week 56, at which point they will have their End of Trial visit.    
Number of Subjects 
PlannedApproximately 120 subjects will be enrolled and treated at approximately 20 centers in the US.

Sample Size The planned sample size for the study is 120 treated subjects.  It 
is assumed that over 75% of these subjects will complete the primary treatment phase resulting in at least 90 subjects with one year of safety data collection. 
Statistical Analysis Study endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics 
These summary measures will include change from baseline, where baseline is the last result prior to treatment. Testing of these change from baseline results for the SF-36, MIDAS and HIT-6 will be performed.
PK and Immunogenicity AnalysesThe concentrations of ALD403 will be measured in plasma from all ALD403 treated subjects using a validated assay method. 
The PK analysis of plasma will include determination of the 
ALD403 concentrations at Day 0 (pre-dose), immediately post-dose (within 15 minutes of end of infusion), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 (pre-dose), 24 (pre-dose), 36 (pre-dose), 48 (pre-dose), 72 (pre-dose), and 104 End of Trial/Early Withdrawal. 
Population PK analysis will be performed on the results for ALD403 concentrations obtained during this study in combination with the results from other studies of ALD403 in normal subjects and migraine patients.Blood samples will be collected for the detection of anti-ALD403 antibody, and when appropriate the samples will be analyzed also for neutralizing anti-ALD403 antibody activity at Day 0 (pre-

5.1. Investigational Product
ALD403 is a humanized anti-(calcitonin gene-r elated peptide) (CGRP) monoclonal antibody 
(anti-CGRP) that is being developed by Alder for the prophylaxis of migraine. 
5.2. Background
Migraine is a highly prevalent paroxysmal neurological disease characterized by recurrent 
episodes of moderate to seve re headache associated with physiological disruptions of 
neurological, gastrointestinal, and sensory function.  Episodes typically last between 4 and 72 hours and recur often without warn ing over decades of time.  It is most prevalent through the 
3
rdand 4thdecades of life with a significant gender bias of 3:1 for women.1Migraine is the most 
prevalent neurological disease for which medica l treatment is sought, and considered the 6th 
leading cause of disability in the world.2Annually, lost work time and diminished productivity 
attributable to migraine costs Amer ican employers an estimated $19.6 billion.3
Migraine appears to have a sign ificant genetic/epigenetic compone nt to its etiology and it is 
observed in all age groups, races, and ethnicities.  Generally, mi graine begins as an episodic 
disease.  Between episodes of migraine the nervous system returns to a normal (premorbid) state of function.  However, approx imately 2.5% of people with episodic migraine will annually 
transform from episodic to chronic migraine, mean ing they are experiencing migraine on greater 
than 15 days per month for at  least 3 consecutive months.
4For those with chronic migraine, the 
headaches are more intense; migraine-associated symptoms, more severe; and the disease-related impact and disability are much greater than observed for episodic migraine.
5In addition, chronic 
migraine is associated with more co-morbid diseases such as anxiety, depression, and non-
headache pain.6
The pathophysiology of migraine is complex and incompletely understood.  Current models of 
migraine are based on a genetically determined hy per-excitable nervous system characterized by 
a lowered threshold to sensory activation and uniqueness in its sensory processing.7Interactions 
between this migraine nervous system and speci fic internal and external stimuli (migraine 
triggers) can result in activation of the trigemin ovascular system (TVS).  Once activated the TVS 
releases various vasoactive pep tides generating peripheral sensitiz ation of trigeminal and upper

Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 16of 78cervical nociceptors. The ensuing peripheral nociceptive stimuli synapse in the Trigeminal 
Nucleus Caudalis to ultimately create a state of central sensitization.8Clinically, this process is 
observed as a fully develope d attack of migraine.  
Central to this model of migraine is calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) . CGRP is one of the 
most abundant peptides in the human body and is produced in both peripheral and central neurons.  It is abundant in trig eminal neurons and when released  is involved in the vasodilation, 
inflammatory cascade, and pain transmission asso ciated with migraine. In both peripheral and 
central pain pathways CGRP is associated with pain transmission and neuronal sensitization.
9
Intravenous (IV) infusions of CGRP can cau se a migraine-like headache in susceptible 
individuals with migraine.10In addition, many pharmacological agents used as acute or 
prophylactic treatment of migraine are known to inhibit CGRP. Thus, CGRP is an attractive 
target for development of novel migraine pharmacology.
Currently the pharmacological treatment of migraine  can be divided into ac ute treatment, that is, 
medications designed to reverse a migraine after it is initiated and preventive treatment that is 
designed to protect the nervous system from generating migraine. Acute treatments are used 
intermittently only as needed to stop an attack while preventative treatments are used on a sustained basis for periods of months to years.  Acute treatment while generally quite effective 
can worsen the severity and frequency of migrai ne when used too frequently, a condition called 
medication overuse headache (MOH).
4MOH is common in populations with frequent episodic 
and chronic migraine.11
Numerous medications are used to prevent mig raine but to date none have been designed 
specifically for migraine. These commonly include tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, and certain anticonvulsants. It is es timated that 45% of adults with  frequent episodic migraine and 
virtually all with chronic migraine would benef it from effective preventive medications yet only 
an estimated 12% of this population are currently using a migraine preventive.
1In large 
measure, this is due to poor tolerability, lack of efficacy, and failure to adhere to treatment.  Clearly there is a medical need to develop effective, well-tolerated and safe preventive 
treatments for migraine.

ALD403 is a genetically engin eered humanized immunoglobulin G1  (IgG1) antibody that binds 
to human- Į-CGRP with an affinity of 1.5E-11 M and human- ȕ-CGRP with an affinity of 
5.7E-11 M.
5.3.1. Summary of Nonclinical Studies
A nonclinical testing program has been conducte d supporting the use of ALD403 in clinical 
trials. More detailed discussion is provided in the current version of the ALD403 Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).

Pharmacodynamic activity by ALD403 in the specie s selected for toxicological investigations 
(rats, rabbits, and monkeys) was c onfirmed in vivo by conducting studies to determine the ability 
of ALD403 to inhibit CGRP-mediate d neurogenic dermal vasodilation.
In the single-dose nonclinical toxicology studies , the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) 
for IV administration of ALD403 to rats and cynomolgus monkeys was 100 mg/kg.
Toxicological investigations in rats and monkeys  indicated that repeated -dose IV administration 
of ALD403 at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg once weekly for four weeks was well to lerated, with no signs 
of adverse effects related to treatment. Under the conditions of these studies, the no-observed-
adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for once weekly IV  administration of ALD403 to rats or monkeys 
for four weeks was 100 mg/kg.
A chronic multiple-dose toxicology study in cyno molgus monkeys was conducted to evaluate the 
potential effects by ALD403 following 6-months administration via slow bolus injection once

by a three month recovery period in select animals. 
Following the sixth dosing occasion on study day 71, one low-dose (20 mg/kg/dose) female 
animal exhibited an anaphylactoid-like reacti on and died within approximately 30 minutes. 
Collectively, the clinical, gross, and micro scopic findings were consistent with an ADA-
mediated anaphylactoid event as the cause of  death.  Humanized monoclonal antibodies are 
known for their potential to illicit severe immunologic reactions in  monkeys and therefore, the 
death of one animal was considered as a class effect.Administration of ALD403 via intravenous (s low bolus) injection once every 2 weeks for 
approximately 6-months (for a to tal of 14 doses) did not result in  any treatment-related effects 
upon the parameters evaluated in this study.  The NOAEL for ALD403 following chronic 
administration in monkeys was considered to be 150 mg/kg/dose (Day 183 mean C
maxof 
19,600/6,160 ȝg/mL; mean AUC (0-2wk) of 1,610,000/904,000 ȝg·h/mL for males/females, 
respectively).
ALD403 is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromo somal materials, and 
genotoxicity assessments have not been conducte d. The carcinogenic potential for ALD403 has 
not been thoroughly investigated. The results of toxicological and clinical investigations to date 
with ALD403 have provided no indications of effe cts with the potential to support or induce the 
proliferation of malignant cells.
Definitive embryo-fetal devel opment studies with ALD403 in rats and rabbits have been 
conducted.  The administration of  ALD403 by intravenous (slow bolus) injection to pregnant 
female rats on Days 6, 12 and 18 post coitum or pregnant female New Zealand White rabbits on 
Days 7, 13 and 20 post coitum, at 75 or 150 mg/k g/dose was well tolerated, and there was no 
evidence of embryo-fetal mortality (embryolethality), alterations in growth (fetotoxicity), or 
structural abnormalities (teratogenicity) in either species.  
The local tolerance of ALD403 was assessed following repeated-(once weekly) dose studies in 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys utilizing ALD 403 administered IV. Following the end-of-
treatment, no gross or microscopi c lesions were observed in the ALD403 injection sites excised 
from rats. In the injection sites obtained from cynomolgus monkeys, only procedure-related

Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 20of 785.3.3. Dose Justification
A dose of 300mg ALD403 administered by IV infusion every 12 weeks has shown efficacy in 
the treatment of CM and is the maximum anticipated dose and schedule. No dose limiting, 
treatment related adverse effe cts have been observed following ALD403 administration up to 
1000mg. ALD403 single dose levels up to 1000m g have generally be en well tolerated.
5.4. Risks and Benefits
ALD403 may prevent migraine from occurring in patients treated in this trial.  No specific toxicities or adverse effects related to the bloc kade of CGRP by ALD403 have been identified in 
either the nonclinical toxicology program or the clinical trials with AL D403 that have been 
completed to date. 
There may be unknown adverse effects and unfores eeable risks associated with study drug 
administration or unexpected interactions with a nother drug that have not yet been identified. 
As with all protein therapeutics, there is a risk  of a serious allergic reaction.  In completed 
ALD403 trials conducted to  date, no serious allerg ic reactions have been observed with the 
administration of ALD403 in humans. In the completed ALD403 clinical trials with headache patients, the most common observed 
adverse events (>5%) with receiving ALD403 or placebo included upper respiratory tract 
infection, back pain, dizziness, ar thralgia, urinary tract infection, and headache.  The majority of 
these adverse events were categorized as mild to moderate.
Long term data with ALD403 is limited. 
xHealthy volunteer trials have included limited dosing, short duration of follow up and 
have not included long term follow-up.
xTrials in migraine patients have also included limiting dosing.  These trials are currently ongoing and no new significant findings have been noted during the follow-up period to date.

9.1. Investigational Product 
ALD403 is an anti-(calcitonin gene-related pe ptide) humanized monoclonal antibody (anti-
CGRP mAb) that is being developed by Alder for the prevention of migraine.  
ALD403 Injection, 100 mg/vial, is presented in 2-mL Type I glass vials as a single-use 
preservative-free solution for IV administration.  ALD403 is formulated at a concentration of 
100 mg/mL with a pH of 5.8.  Subjects will receive an IV infusion of ALD403 300 mg Injection 
in 100 mL of 0.9% saline.  
9.2. Investigational Product Administration
ALD403 (approximate volume of 100 mL) is administered IV over a period of 30 ( +15) minutes 
at the visits specified in Schedule of Events in Section 2, by the Investigator or designee. 
Infusions may be administered for a total duration of up to 1 hour, if needed in the judgement of 
the Investigator.  
If the subject experiences a headache or migraine on dosing day, dosing may occur if, in the 
investigator’s opinion, it will not compromise the sa fety of the subject.  The Medical Monitor 
may be consulted as needed.  Subjects must remain in the care facility and be monitored by site staff for at least 2 hours after the infusion ends.  The Investigator or sub-investigator must be 
immediately available during the infusion and for at least 2 hours after the end of infusion to 
assess each subject for the occurrence of adverse events. Subjects will be requested to stay longer than 2 hours after the end of infusion should the i nvestigator determine it is clinically warranted 
(i.e., subjects should be observed until all AEs are resolved or clinically stable).  The timeframe for the post-dose observation period must be documented in the source record.
Further instructions on ALD403 preparation and administration can be found in the Pharmacy 
Manual.

Investigators shall take adequate precautions, including storage of ALD403 in a securely locked, 
substantially constructed cabinet or other secure ly locked, substantially constructed enclosure, 
access to which is limited to prevent theft or diversion of the substance into illegal channels of distribution.
9.2.3. Accountability and Disposition of ALD403
The Investigator is responsible for mainta ining accurate ALD403 accountability records 
throughout the clinical trial. The site must ma intain an Investigational Product Accountability 
Logas per the study Pharmacy Manual. Where more than one secure area is being used for 
storage at a site, all movement of ALD403 throu gh the chain of custody must be recorded in 
accountability records such that full reconciliation may be completed at the end of the trial. 
Included with each ALD403 shipment is a form  listing lot numbers and quantity shipped. The 
Investigator, responsible pharmacist, or designee, will sign and return to Alder, or designee, a 
statement that certifies the receipt and integrity of these supplies. A copy will be retained for the 
site clinical trial file.
After completion of the clinical trial, the Inve stigator is responsible for either returning or 
destroying all unused ALD403. The Investigator mu st verify that no remaining supplies are in 
his/her possession. All used/partially used vials/IV bags will be destroyed onsite according to the 
site SOPs or returned according to Alder directive. Destruction must be in accordance with local 
regulations for the product type and destructi on documentation must be provided to Alder.

disposition of the unused supplies (as authorized by Alder). 
9.3. Concomitant Medications
Any concomitant therapy used from the time the subject signs the informed consent through 
Week 104 must be recorded on the CRF, including  medications required for treatment of any 
AEs or SAEs. The medication name, dosage, date, and indication for use must be recorded. The 
Medical Monitor or designee shoul d be notified in advance of (or as soon as possible after) any 
instances in which restricted therapies are administered. 
Subjects on stable medication for headache prophylaxis for 3 months prior to screening will be 
permitted to continue use during the study, provided there are no alterations to their regimen, 
except as allowed per Investigator discretion. After Week 48, changes to migraine prophylactic 
treatment are allowed per Investigator or the s ubject’s primary treating healthcare professional. 
A list of the migraine preventive therapies with established or probable efficacy is in Section 15.1 for reference. Sites are required to indicate if a medication is used for prophylaxis 
purposes or if it is used for th e acute treatment of migraines.

10.2. Assessments and Procedures
10.2.1. Demographics
The year of birth, age, sex, ethnicity, race, and how the subject was recru ited to the trial will be 
collected in source records and in the CRF.  
10.2.2. Medical History
Significant historic and current medical conditions or illnesses, allergies to medications, and 
prior surgical interventions will be recorded in the source records and in the CRF.  Symptoms 
that are ongoing at the time of informed consent will be considered medical history.
Migraine history will also be collected in the source records and the CRF, including age at 
diagnosis of chronic migraine as well as other deta ils of the subjects’ history with migraine.  If 
the subject is not a current or past user of a prescribed medication for migraine, the Medical 
Monitor should be consulted.  
Investigators should demonstrate due diligence in tr ying to obtain medical records.  All attempts 
to obtain medical records should be documented.  If medical records cannot be obtained, history 
may be confirmed via patient interview in order to obtain sufficient information to confirm all 
eligibility criteria are met.
10.2.3. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations will be performed at the times noted in the Schedule of Events in 
Section 2 and must be performed by an Investigator who has been trained and delegated the task 
on the Delegation of Authority Log.
The screening physical examination will include a review of all body systems. For all other visits 
that call for a physical examination, the body syst ems reviewed will be at the discretion of the 
Investigator.

Abnormal physical examination findings at the screening visit will be recorded as medical 
history.  Any new or worsening physical examination finding identified after informed consent 
will be considered an AE.
10.2.4. Vital Signs
Vital signs, including blood pressure (BP) and pulse will be measured at the time points specified 
in the Schedule of Events in Section 2.
When measuring vital signs, the subject should be  seated comfortably, with back supported and 
rested for 5 minutes before the measurements begin.  For BP measurements, the subject should have th eir upper arm positioned so that it is level with 
their heart and feet flat on the floor.  Excess clothing that might interfere with the BP cuff or 
constrict blood flow in the arm should be remove d. A blood pressure cuff of appropriate size 
should be wrapped around the bare upper arm such that the bladder portion of the cuff extends at 
least 80% around the arm.  The center of the bladde r should be in line with the brachial artery so 
as to allow the stethoscope diaphragm clear access to the brachial artery.  Site staff and subject should refrain from talking during the reading.  Blood pressure may be repeated to confirm 
measurement.

11.1. Adverse Events
11.1.1. Definitions
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occu rrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical prod uct that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE can th erefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), sympto m, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product , whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. (ICH E6)
11.1.2. Assessment of Adverse Events
The Investigator is required to monitor the o ccurrence of adverse events for each subject from 
the time of informed consent through the course of  the clinical trial.  Adverse events may be 
reported by the subject, reported by a caregiver, or reported by the investigative site through 
Investigator site personnel open-ended questioning, through physical examination, laboratory 
test, documentation in medical records, or by other means.  Adverse events include:
xAny new undesirable medical experience or an unfavorable and unintended change of an 
existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related 
to the Investigational Product.
xAny abnormal assessment or laboratory findings considered by the Investigator to be 
clinically significant.  Clinically significant findings include but are not limited to those 
that lead to discontinuation or interrupti on of study treatment, require therapeutic 
intervention, or require a change in subject management.
A new or worsening of a pre-existing or chroni c condition is considered an adverse event and 
must be reported as such.  Medical conditions, which existed prior to the time of informed consent into the clinical tria l, will not be considered an a dverse event unless the condition 
worsens.  Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre-existing conditions from the time of 
informed consent are not adverse events and should not be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
Protocol ALD403-CLIN-013
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.
16 January 2018
Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 41of 78Pre-existing medical conditions of clinical signifi cance must be included in  the subject’s medical 
history and recorded on the medical history eCRF page. 
Each event recorded on the AE eCRF is required to  be assessed by the Inve stigator with regard 
to the following; seriousness, severity, and relationship to ALD403, as outlined below.Seriousness
An adverse event or suspected adverse event is considered serious if in the view of either the 
Investigator or Alder, it results in;
xDeath
xIs life-threatening (this means that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe)
xInpatient hospitalization or pr olonged existing hospitalization. 
xA persistent or significant incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
xCongenital anomaly/ birth defect
xImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition (
21 CFR 
312.32(a) and ICH E2A).
Of note: 
oA social hospitalization (i.e., hospitaliza tions for pre-admissions not due to an 
acute medical issue) is not considered an SAE.
oHospitalization is considered a grea ter than 24 hour hospital admission.
Protocol ALD403-CLIN-013
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.
16 January 2018
Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 42of 78Severity
The severity of an AE will be graded as follows:
xGrade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.
xGrade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
xGrade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL.
xGrade 4 Life-threatening consequenc es; urgent intervention indicated.
xGrade 5 Death related to AE.
Relationship to ALD403
The Investigator is required to assess the ca usality/relationship betw een each AE and the 
ALD403 as not related or related and record th e assessment on the source documents and in the 
eCRF AE page. Medical judgment should be used to determine the likely relationship of the AE 
to the ALD403 considering all relevant factors including (but not limited to) relevant history, 
concomitant medical condition, and concomitant medications.  De termination should be based 
on assessment of temporal relationships, biologic pl ausibility, association (or lack of association) 
with underlying disease, and presence (or absence) of a more likely cause.  
Not Related: It is plausible that the AE has an etiology other than the ALD403 (e.g., pre-
existing condition, underlying disease, conc omitant medical condition, or concomitant 
medication).Related: The AE cannot reasonably be explaine d by the subject’s clinical state,
concomitant\medical condition or concomitant therapies, and a temporal relationship 
exists between the event onset and administration of the ALD403.

16 January 2018
Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 43of 7811.1.3. Recording Adverse Events
Event reporting will extend from time of informed consent until completion of the final visit. 
Serious adverse events occurring after the end of the clinical trial must be reported if the 
Investigator considers there to be a causal relationship with ALD403. 
An SAE Notification Form should be used to repo rt any related SAEs which occur after the end 
of the clinical trial. Adverse events (AEs) should be recorded on the AE eCRF, whether believed by the Investigator 
to be related or not related to the ALD403. 
AE reporting should contain:
xA brief description of the event
xDate of onset 
xDate of resolution
xSeverity
xActions taken or treatment required 
xRelationship to Inve stigational Product 
xOutcome 
xWhether the event is considered serious
Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis into a single event term.  For example, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be 
grouped together as “upper respiratory tract infection.”
Asymptomatic abnormal findings considered by th e Investigator to be clinically significant 
should be recorded as an AE, unless it is associated with a clinical syndrome that has already 
been reported as an AE.
11.1.4. Reporting Seriou s Adverse Events
All SAEs that occur during the period of obser vation, whether considered  to be related to 
ALD403 or not, must be reported within 24 hours of awareness or knowledge of the event.  The

Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 44of 78date the site personnel became aware of the serious adverse event must be recorded in the source 
document.  To report the SAE, complete the eCRF AE page and indicate the reason for 
seriousness.  The minimum information required for an initial report is:
xSender of report (name, address of Investigator)
xSubject identification (screening/enrollment number, NOT subject name)
xProtocol number
xDescription of SAE (e.g., event term)
xSeriousness criteria
xRelationship assessment
After receipt of the initial repor t, the Medical Monitor or designee will review the information 
and, if necessary, contact the Investigator to obtain further information for assessment of the 
event.  Alder, or Alder’s designee will be res ponsible for information processing and reporting in 
accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. 
Alder will determine if an SAE requires expedited reporting to regulatory agencies.  The clinical 
trial site personnel are responsible  for reporting these events to their EC/IRB according to the 
institution’s EC/IRB reporting requirements a nd in accordance with applicable local and 
regulatory requirements.
Should the EDC System not be available, serious  adverse events must be reported on the paper 
SAE Notification Form. Additiona l details can be found in the Site Manual. This does not 
replace the EDC reporting system; information must be entered in the EDC system once the 
system returns to normal function.
11.1.5. Unexpected and Relate d Serious Adverse Events
Unexpected SAEs are those which:
xAre not previously reported as associat ed with ALD403, as referenced in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.
Protocol ALD403-CLIN-013
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.
16 January 2018
Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 45of 78xMay be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an AE listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, but differ from the ev ent due to greater severity, frequency, or 
specificity.
Alder, or Alder’s designee will report, to the appropriate regulatory authorities according to local and regulatory requirements, unexpected SAEs  which are considered related to ALD403 
(suspected unexpected serious a dverse reactions [SUSARs]).  The clinical trial site personnel are 
responsible for reporting these events to their EC /IRB in accordance with applicable local and 
regulatory requirements.
11.1.6. Follow-up of Adverse Events
Irrespective of the suspected causality, AEs w ill be monitored until resolution, stabilization in 
the judgment of the Investigator, or the subject is lost to follow up or withdraws from the trial.
11.1.7. Clinical Laboratory TestsSerum chemistry tests include albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP ), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ur ea nitrogen, calcium, bi carbonate, creatinine, 
globulin, glucose, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, to tal bilirubin, total choles terol, total protein, 
triglycerides, magnesium, and uric acid.
Hematology tests include hemato crit, hemoglobin, platelet count , red blood cell (RBC) count, and 
white blood cell (WBC) count with differen tials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, 
eosinophils, and basophils).
11.1.8. Pregnancy
In the event that a female subject becomes preg nant following administration of ALD403 or may 
have been pregnant at the time of ALD403 exposure, or the partner of a male subject becomes 
pregnant following ALD403 administration to the male subject, the pregnancy must be reported 
to Alder within five business days of the In vestigator becoming aware of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancy information will be reported to Alder using the Exposure In-Utero Forms in EDC.  An 
Exposure In-Utero Notification Form should be used to report a pregnancy that occurs within 30 
days after completion of the trial.

birth defect or congenital anomaly or hospitalizati on for any reason is considered to be an SAE.  
Every attempt should be made to follow a pregnancy to conclusion.  
Follow-up information is to be collected by the Investigator and provided to Alder regarding:
xThe course of the pregnancy including perinatal and neonatal outcome, premature
termination of the pregnancy, or miscarriage 
xOffspring information including birth weight and birth defects (if any) 
11.1.9. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
Recent meta-analyses, spontaneous reports, a nd published case reports regarding suicidal 
ideation and behavior arising from drugs tested in clinical trials have been noted as an area of 
general concern. Based on this  information, the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) has provided guidance to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical 
trials to ensure that subjects in clinical trials who are experiencing suicidal ideation and behavior 
are properly recognized and adequately treated and to ensure the collection of more timely and 
more complete data on suicidal ideation and behavior than have  been collected in the past.12The 
C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) will be used for this purpose.  Any subject who answers “yes” to questions 4 or 5 of the C- SSRS during the screening visit will be referred 
to a mental health specialist by the Investigator.  During the course of the trial after dosing, any subject who answers “yes” to questions 4 or 5 in the Suicidal Ideation section or answers “yes” 
to any question in the Suicidal Behavior sec tion of the C-SSRS will be discontinued from the 
study treatment as specified in Section 8.4.1, and re ferred by Investigators to a mental health 
specialist.  Affirmative answers to questions 4 or  5 for suicidal ideation or to any question for 
suicidal behavior will be reported in EDC as an AE.
11.2. Management of Reactions to ALD403 
There are no specific antidotes to ALD403. 
Each medical emergency should be treated appr opriately by the Investigator using proper 
standard of care, according to their typical clinical practice and local guidelines for that 
emergency condition. Emergency equipment and me dication for the treatment of these potential 
adverse events must be available for immediate use.  
Protocol ALD403-CLIN-013

16 January 2018
Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 47of 78Should a medical condition arise that the Investigator believes is related to ALD403, clinical 
judgment should be used to provide the appropr iate response including the consideration of 
discontinuation of ALD403. Subjects who have experienced a potential significant allergic reaction after administration of  ALD403 should not receive subs equent doses until discussed 
with the Medical Monitor and an appropr iate disposition has been agreed upon.
If a subject experiences a potential systemic allerg ic reaction, as assessed by the Investigator, the 
site will collect additional blood specimens using the immune respons e lab kit at the time of the 
event as per laboratory manual. Th e Medical Monitor may request a 2
ndimmune response lab kit 
be collected in approximately 4-6 weeks after the 1stcollection. This immune response 
assessment includes serum hist amine, serum tryptase, immunogl obulin E, and complement 
components.
Whether maintained in a “formal crash cart” or separately, the following is a requirement at the 
site:
xCPR certification by site staff performing study assessments
xAutomated external defibrillator (AED)
xEmergency medications including antihistamines, bronchodilators, IV saline, 
corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and epinephrine
The AED and emergency medication should be immediately available on an Investigational 
product infusion day.

Much Improved, Minimally Improved, No Change, Minimally Worse, Much Worse, Very Much 
Worse.
SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36 v2.0)
The SF-36 v2.0 is a health survey containing 36 questions consisting of eight scaled scores to 
measure quality of life over the past 4 weeks.  See Appendix 15.4.  The eight sections measured 
are vitality, physical functioning, bodily pai n, general health perceptions, physical role 
functioning, emotional role f unctioning, social role functi oning, and mental health.  
EQ-5D-5L
The EQ-5D-5L is a descriptive system of health -related quality of life stat es consisting of five 
dimensions/questions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) 
each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no 
problems/slight problems/modera te problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a 
particular EQ-5D dimension. The EQ-5D-5L add itionally includes a VAS scale.  Each item will 
be summarized separately.
Headache Impact Test  (HIT-6 v1.0)
The Headache Impact Test (HIT) is a tool used to measure the impact and effect on the ability to 
function normally in daily life when a headache occurs. The HIT is a 6 question, Likert-type, 
self-reporting questionnaire with responses ra nging from “Never” to “Always” with the 
following response scores: Never=6, Rarely= 8, Sometimes=10, Very Of ten=11, Always=13. See

Most Bothersome Symptom (MBS)
At screening, subjects will identify migraine related symptom that is most bothersome for them.  
Subjects will be asked to rate the improvement in this symptom from screening on a seven-point 
scale identical to the scale used for the PGIC.
The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS)
The MIDAS questionnaire measur es the effect headaches have on the subject’s daily

the past 3 months.  The response to each question is provided in number of days which are 
totaled to determine the level of disability: 0- 5, MIDAS Grade I, Little or no disability; 6-10,
MIDAS Grade II, Mild disability; 11-20, MIDAS Grade III, Moderate disability; 21+, MIDAS 
Grade IV, Severe disability.
12.2. Pharmacokinetics
The concentrations of ALD403 will be measured  in plasma from all treated subjects using a 
validated assay. The PK analysis will include ev aluations of concentrati on-time profiles for free 
ALD403 on Day 0 (pre-dose and immediately post-dos e (within 15 minutes of end of infusion), 
and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 (pre-dose), 24 (pre-dose), 36  (pre-dose), 48 (pre-dose), 72 (pre-dose), and 
104 or ET. 
All plasma PK samples will be stored at -20°C or below prior to shipping to the central 
laboratory.Additional sample handling, processing, storage, labeling, and shipping instructions will be 
provided to the site in a laboratory manual.

Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 50of 78If a subject terminates early fr om the clinical trial, all efforts will be made to collect blood 
samples to analyse for free ALD403 unless consent has been withdrawn.
12.3. Immunogenicity
Serum blood samples will be taken on Day 0 (pre-dose), a nd Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 (pre-dose), 
24 (pre-dose), 36 (pre-dose), 48 (pre-dose), 72 (pre-dose) and 104 or ET to test for the 
development of antibodies to ALD403. The immunog enicity will be assess ed in serum from all 
ALD403-treated subjects usin g a validated assay.  
If a subject terminates early fr om the clinical trial, all efforts will be made to collect blood 
samples to analyze for antibodies against ALD 403 unless consent has been withdrawn. For any 
samples that are positive for anti-ALD403 anti body, there may be additional testing to 
characterize the anti-ALD403 antibody for the po tential to neutralize (NAb) ALD403 activity.  
Subjects who test positive for specific anti-ALD403 antibodies at the time of the last study visit 
will be asked to provide up to 2 additional blood samples for immunogenicity testing at 
approximately 3 month intervals for up to 6 months.
Additional sample handling, processing, storage, labeling, and shipping instructions will be 
provided to the site in a laboratory manual.

13.1. Sample Size
The planned sample size for the study is 120 treat ed subjects.  It is assumed that over 75% of 
these subjects will complete the primary treatment phase resulting in at least 90 subjects with one 
year of safety data collection.
13.2. General Considerations
13.2.1. Definition of Baseline
The baseline assessment will be the latest available valid measurement taken prior to the 
administration of Investigational Product. This will generally be Day 0.
13.2.2. Handling of Missing Data
Summary statistics will be  reported based upon observed data. If  the start date of an AE or 
concomitant medication is incomplete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after 
the intake of ALD403, except if an incomplete da te (e.g., month and year) clearly indicates that 
the event started prior to treatment. 
13.2.3. Populations to be Analyzed
The Safety Population, the analysis population for this study, includes all subjects who received 
at least one dose of treatment. 
13.3. Interim Analyses
This study will include a formal interim analysis after all subjects have completed the primary 
treatment phase. 
13.4. Statistical Methods
Continuous variables will be su mmarized with mean, median, standard de viation, minimum, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequency and percentage. Change from baseline will be summarized as well as the results at the time point.

An accounting of subjects by disposition will be presented. This summarization will include a 
summary of all subjects who have received trial drug ALD403. Demographic, baseline 
characteristics, migraine history and concomitant medications (coded by the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary) will be summarized descriptively.
13.4.2. Efficacy Analyses
The Secondary endpoints will be su mmarized with descriptive sta tistics by time point.  These 
summary measures will be base d upon the observed results and where appropriate the change 
from baseline results. Testing of these change from baseline results for the SF-36, MIDAS and 
HIT-6 will be performed at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 104. For SF-36 tests will be 
performed for the change in the Mental Compone nt and Physical Component scores and for the 
HIT-6 and MIDAS tests will be pe rformed based upon the change in total score. The tests will be 
a t-test. 
13.4.3. Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Analysis of Drug Concentrations
The concentrations of ALD403 will be listed and su mmarized by time point and dose group, and 
descriptive statistics will be provided. In this analysis, concentrations below the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) will be set to zero.  
Plots of the individual concentrations of ALD 403 will be presented over  time (linear and log 
scales). Plots of the mean or median concentration will be presented over time (linear and log 
scales). When the scale is linear, concentrations below the lower limit of quantification will be 
set to zero. In the log-scaled figures, concentrations below the LLOQ will be imputed as 
LLOQ/2.  Population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed on the results for ALD403 
concentrations obtained during this study in comb ination with the results from other studies of 
ALD403 in normal subjects  and migraine patients.

13.4.4.1. Adverse Events
The incidence of all AEs will be tabulated. These AEs will be classified by system organ class 
and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). For 
incidence reporting, if a subject reported more th an 1 AE that was coded to the same preferred 
term/system organ class, the s ubject will be counted only once for that specific preferred 
term/system organ class. Events recorded between the time the informed consent is signed and 
the first treatment administration will be listed.
An overview of AEs, which includes subject incide nce of AEs, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation, will be presented. For AEs presente d by severity, the worst severity during the 
clinical trial will be presented for each subject.
The subject incidence of AEs will be summarize d by system organ class and preferred term.
13.4.4.2. Serious Ad verse Events
All SAEs will be listed and summarized in a similar manner to AEs. 
13.4.4.3. Clinical Laboratory Results
Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for clinical 
laboratory results by scheduled visit. Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the 
normal reference range at any post-baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline 
clinical laboratory values base d upon the normal range will be tabulated. Subjects developing an 
antibody response will be listed.
13.4.4.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Results
The observed data at baseline and change from baseline for each measurement day will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics.  
13.4.4.5. Vital Signs
The observed data at baseline and change from  baseline for each measurement day will be

14.1. Data Quality Assurance
Alder, or Alder’s designee will assess each site to verify the qualifications of the Investigator, 
according to Alder’s, or designee’s SOPs. Site facilities will be inspecte d, and the Investigator 
will be informed of responsibilities and the pro cedures for ensuring adequate and correct 
documentation.
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical trial for each clinical 
trial subject. All information recorded on the CRFs for this clinical trial must be consistent with 
the subjects’ source documentation (i.e., medical records).
14.2. Case Report Forms and Source Documents 
As part of the responsibilities assume d by participating in the study,  the principal investigator or 
sub-investigator agrees to mainta in adequate case histories for the patients treated as part of the 
research under this protocol. The principal investigator or sub-i nvestigator agrees to maintain 
accurate eCRFs and source documentation as part of the case histories. These source documents 
include, but are not limited to, laboratory reports and original ECGs. 
14.2.1. Study Documentation
Source document is defined as any hand written or  computer generated document that contains 
medical information or test results that have been  collected for or are in support of the protocol 
specifications, e.g., clinical laboratory reports, clin ic notes, drug disbursement log, subject sign 
in sheets, subject completed questionnaires if a pplicable, telephone logs, ECGs, etc. All draft, 
preliminary and pre-final iterations of a final report are also considered to be source documents, 
e.g., faxed laboratory reports and hard copy laboratory reports, faxed initial results and hard 
copy, final report.
14.2.2. Case Report Form 
The data collected during the study (except clinical laboratory test results, ECG results, PK 
analyses, Immunogenicity) will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. The Short-Form Health

Patient Global Impression of Ch ange (PGIC), Most Botherso me Symptom (MBS) and C-SSRS 
will be completed on paper forms and then entered into the EDC system. The study site(s) will 
use an electronic data capture (EDC) system that is compliant with relevant Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) regulatory requirements per 21 CFR Part 11. Data  queries and data 
corrections will be handled through the same system. All transactions within the EDC system are 
fully documented within an electronic audit trail. Each set of completed eCRFs must be reviewed 
after being source verified by the Monitor and electronically signed and dated by the 
Investigator.  
14.3. Archiving Clinical Trial Records
According to ICH guidelines, essential documents  should be retained for a minimum of 2 years 
after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an IC H region or at least 2 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of c linical development of the Inve stigational Product. However, 
these documents should be retained for a long er period if required by applicable legal 
requirements. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator and clin ical trial staff to main tain a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all clinical trial-relate d documentation. This cen tralized file should 
be available for inspection at any time by the Monitor or Quality Assurance staff for monitoring 
or auditing by Alder and regulato ry authorities. Elements of clin ical trial documentation should 
include:
xSubject files containing the completed CRF-supporting source documentation and the 
signed ICF
xClinical trial files, containing the protoc ol with all amendments, the Investigator 
Brochure, copies of all cl inical trial documentation, a nd all correspondence to and 
from the ethics committee and Alder Inc.
xPharmacy files, containing the Investigational Product Acc ountability Records or 
dispensation logs and all clinical  trial agent-related correspondence

16 January 2018
Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 57of 7814.4. Good Clinical Practice
The procedures set out in this c linical trial protocol are designed to ensure that Alder and the 
Investigator abide by the principles of the GCP guidelines of the ICH and applicable federal and 
local regulations. The clinical  trial also will be conducted in keeping with local legal 
requirements.
14.5. Informed Consent
Before each subject is admitted to the clinical trial, informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject (or his/her legally authorized represen tative) according to the regulatory and legal 
requirements of the participating country. The consent forms must be dated and retained by the Investigator as part of the clinical trial records. The Investigator will not undertake any 
investigation specifically required for the clinical trial until valid consent has been obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented in the CRF. Each 
subject will receive a fully-signed copy of each co nsent form that he/she signs for the clinical 
trial.
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may n eed to be revised to reflect the changes to the 
protocol. If the consent form is revised, it must  be reviewed and appr oved by the appropriate 
ethics committee, and signed by all subjects subsequently screened for the clinical trial as well as 
those currently enrolled in the clinical trial. If  a male subject’s partner becomes pregnant during 
the subject’s participation in the trial, the partner will be asked to sign a separate pregnancy informed consent form to follow the pregnancy outcome, any complications, and the health of 
the baby.  The pregnancy consent should be obtai ned at the time the Investigator becomes aware 
of the pregnancy.
14.6. Protocol Approval and Amendment
Before the start of the clinical trial, the clini cal trial protocol and/or other relevant documents 
will be approved by the ethics committee, in accordance with local legal requirements. Alder must ensure that all ethical and legal requireme nts have been met before the first subject is 
screened in the clinical trial.
The procedures outlined in the protocol and eCRFs will be carefully reviewed by the Investigator 
and staff prior to clinical tria l initiation to ensure appropriate interpretation and implementation. 
Protocol ALD403-CLIN-013
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.

Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 58of 78No deviations from the protocol should be made except in emergency situations where 
alternative treatment is necessary for the prot ection, proper care, and we ll-being of subjects.
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, and approvals must be received from the appropriate  personnel and from the ethics committee before 
implementation (if appropriate). Amendments will originate from Alder and will be provided to the Investigator for submission to his/her ethics committee for their review and approval prior to 
implementation (if appropriate). It should be noted that when an amendment to a protocol 
substantially alters the clinical trial design or increases potential risk to the clinical trial subject, the ICF should be revised and, if applicable, subject ’s consent to continue participation should be 
obtained.
Administrative changes may be made without the need for a formal amen dment. All amendments 
will be distributed to all protocol recipients, with appropriate instructions.
14.6.1. Premature Termination of the Clinical Trial
Alder reserves the right to terminate this clinical trial at any time. The FDA or other governing 
national authority may also terminate the clinical trial.
The Investigator may discontinue pa rticipation in the trial. If the clinical trial is terminated prior 
to scheduled completion, the Investigator will be notified and given any necessary instructions 
concerning final examinations that are require d. If the Investigator, Alder, or the Medical 
Monitor becomes aware of conditions or events th at suggest a possible hazard to subjects if the 
clinical trial continues, the clinical trial may be  terminated after appropr iate consultation between 
the relevant parties. 
14.7. Confidentiality
All clinical trial findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator and 
members of his/her research team must not di sclose such information without prior written 
approval from Alder.

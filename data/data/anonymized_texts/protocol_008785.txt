YNOPSIS
 
Title: Closed-Loop Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (CLtACS) for the Treatment of Depression: Open-label Pilot Study 
Study Description: 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
clinical
 
trial
 
is
 
to
 
investigate
 
the
 
preliminary
 
efficacy
 
of
 
  CLtACS for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in an open-label pilot study. We will recruit up to 35 participants with unipolar, non-psychotic MDD. Eligible participants will have five up to 40-minute stimulation sessions over five consecutive days. All participants will receive CLtACS at their individual peak alpha frequency. Participation will include 13 visits, six of them remotely (with an in-person option as needed), and one electronic survey. Potential participants fill-in an electronic pre-screening form. If preliminarily eligible, a remote screening visit is performed. If eligible, participants attend five consecutive, daily stimulation sessions. Clinical assessments will be performed at Baseline/ day 1 of stimulation (D1), day 5 of stimulation (D5), at follow-up visit 2 (FU2)/ 2 weeks after completion of stimulation (D19), and at follow-up 4 (FU4)/ 6 weeks after completion of stimulation (D47) using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). 7 Self-scoring surveys will be sent after completion of stimulation (FU1, FU2, FU3/ 4 weeks after completion of stimulation, FU4, FU5/ 8 weeks after completion of stimulation, FU6/ 10 weeks after completion of stimulation, FU7/ 12 weeks after completion of stimulation) until 12 weeks after completion of stimulation (D89). Eyes-open and eyes-closed resting state recordings will be collected before and after CLtACS on D1 and during the FU2 visit to measure changes in alpha oscillations. 
Objectives:  Primary Objective: To investigate the preliminary efficacy in reducing depression symptom severity by CLtACS in people with MDD over the course of a 5-day, 40-minute stimulation protocol. Secondary Objective: To investigate the preliminary efficacy in terms of response and remission rates. To investigate the neurophysiological effects of CLtACS on brain activity by means of HD-EEG.

Description of Study Intervention: We will use the XCSITE100Pro stimulator designed by Pulvinar Neuro for investigational purposes to deliver closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (CLtACS). Stimulation waveforms are sine-waves with a zero-to-peak amplitude of 2mA delivered to F3 and F4 with a return electrode at Cz. Participants will stay in a relaxed yet experimentally controlled state by watching a nature movie such as “Reefscape'' during stimulation. Study Duration: 12 months 
Participant Duration: Participation for each participant will last no longer than 13 weeks total. We estimate total participation time to be approximately 13 hours.

INTRODUCTION

ATIONALE
 
  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, often severe psychiatric illness that affects 6.7% of adults 
every
 
year
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
[1].
 
MDD
 
is
 
characterized
 
by
 
depressed
 
mood,
 
loss
 
of
 
interest
 
or
 
pleasure
 
in
 
activities
 
that
 
used
 
to
 
be
 
enjoyable
 
(anhedonia),
 
sleep
 
disturbances,
 
cognitive
 
impairment,
 
and
 
other
 
symptoms
 
that
 
can
 
severely
 
affect
 
quality
 
of
 
life.
 
Current
 
recommended
 
pharmacological
 
treatments
 
are
 
not
 
effective
 
for
 
all
 
people
 
with
 
MDD
 
and
 
can
 
result
 
in
 
undesirable
 
side
 
effects.
 
Prominently,
 
the
 
STAR*D
 
trial
 
demonstrated
 
that
 
a
 
large
 
percentage
 
of
 
patients
 
are
 
treatment-resistant,
 
and
 
that
 
remission
 
is
 
less
 
likely
 
following
 
multiple
 
drug
 
trials
 
[2].
 
More
 
effective
 
and
 
safer
 
therapies
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
of
 
MDD
 
are
 
desperately
 
needed.
   
    
3.2
 
B
ACKGROUND
 
   MDD has been associated with hypoactivity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [3], characterized by 
elevated
 
alpha
 
oscillations
 
[4].
 
Therefore,
 
targeting
 
and
 
reducing
 
alpha
 
oscillations
 
in
 
the
 
left
 
dorsolateral
 
prefrontal
 
cortex
 
could
 
prove
 
beneficial
 
to
 
patients
 
with
 
MDD.
 
Targeted
 
stimulation
 
modalities,
 
such
 
as
 
transcranial
 
alternating
 
current
 
stimulation
 
(tACS),
 
can
 
directly
 
engage
 
and
 
modulate
 
oscillatory
 
activity.
 
tACS
 
utilizes
 
sine-wave
 
stimulation
 
waveforms
 
that
 
can
 
enhance
 
specific
 
oscillatory
 
activity
 
[5].
 
     
 Preclinical and computational studies have contributed to a growing understanding of the mechanism of 
action
 
of
 
tACS
 [7].  At the center of successful target engagement is the modulation of neuronal network 
oscillations
 
by
 
carefully
 
tuned
 
stimulation
 
waveforms
 
that
 
match
 
the
 
endogenous
 
dynamics.
 
Given
 
the
 
low
 
amplitude
 
of
 
the
 
electric
 
field
 
delivered
 
to
 
the
 
brain,
 
modulation
 
of
 
oscillations
 
requires
 
synergistic
 
interaction
 
between
 
the
 
rhythmic
 
stimulation
 
waveform
 
and
 
endogenous
 
brain
 
rhythms
 [8]. Closed-loop 
stimulation
 
allows
 
the
 
adjustment
 
of
 
the
 
stimulation
 
to
 
the
 
fluctuations
 
in
 
individual
 
brain
 
network
 
activity
 
patterns
 
and
 
thus
 
is
 
poised
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
efficacy
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
modulating
 
the
 
targeted
 
oscillation.
 
Briefly,
 
closed-loop
 
stimulation
 
combines
 
periodic
 
measurement
 
of
 
brain
 
activity
 
patterns
 
with
 
EEG
 
and
 
stimulation
 
that
 
is
 
tuned
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
dynamic
 
properties
 
of
 
the
 
measured
 
brain
 
activity.
 
Measurement
 
and
 
stimulation
 
are
 
interleaved
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
electric
 
artefacts
 
caused
 
by
 
stimulation.
 
This
 
approach
 
has
 
been
 
pioneered
 
by
 
the
 
Frohlich
 
Lab
 
and
 
was
 
demonstrated
 
to
 
successfully
 
modulate
 
another,
 
transient
 
thalamo-cortical
 
activity
 
pattern,
 
sleep
 
spindles
 
and
 
associated

  Risk of Embarrassment: Self-report assessments contain questions regarding sensitive personal 
information,
 
which
 
may
 
lead
 
to
 
emotions
 
of
 
embarrassment.
 
This
 
risk
 
is
 
necessary
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
assess
 
mood
 
symptoms
 
and
 
associated
 
psychopathology.

HIPAA
 
protected
 
information.
 
  Risk of Injury and Discomfort: The side effects of tACS are mild and transient; in fact, low intensity 
transcranial
 
current
 
stimulation,
 
such
 
as
 
tACS,
 
has
 
been
 
used
 
for
 
several
 
years
 
without
 
any
 
report
 
of
 
serious
 
side
 
effects
 
[12].
 
Furthermore,
 
this
 
stimulation
 
mode
 
has
 
nothing
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
electroconvulsive
 
therapy
 
that
 
applies
 
many
 
orders
 
of
 
magnitude
 
higher
 
stimulation
 
current.
 
Rather,
 
transcranial
 
current
 
stimulation
 
is
 
so
 
weak
 
that
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
cause
 
super-threshold
 
activation
 
of
 
neurons
 
[13].
 
However,
 
tACS
 
does
 
have
 
some
 
mild
 
side
 
effects,
 
such
 
as
 
transient
 
mild
 
tingling,
 
burning,
 
or
 
itching
 
under
 
the
 
electrode
 
sites.
     
[6].
 
To
 
monitor
 
these
 
mild
 
side
 
effects,
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
administering
 
a
 
stimulation
 
questionnaire
 
after
 
each
 
stimulation
 
session
 
to
 
determine
 
whether
 
these
 
effects
 
were
 
experienced
 
and
 
at
 
what
 
intensity.
 
Research
 
personnel
 
are
 
present
 
during
 
the
 
full
 
experiment.
 
  Patients with MDD have an about 20 times higher rate of suicide than average. We have no evidence 
that
 
our
 
treatment
 
paradigms
 
will
 
in
 
any
 
way
 
increase
 
this
 
likelihood.
 
Rather,
 
active
 
engagement
 
in
 
a
 
clinical
 
trial
 
may
 
offer
 
hope
 
and
 
structure
 
to
 
the
 
participants.
 
Regardless,
 
participants
 
with
 
high
 
suicide
 
risk
 
(intent

will

completion
 
of
 
the

in
 
a

$300.
   Research personnel will be easily available for the participants to contact via email or phone. The 
inclusion
 
criteria
 
state
 
that
 
each
 
participant
 
must
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
understand
 
all
 
risks
 
and
 
benefits
 
associated
 
with
 
this
 
study.
 
We
 
will
 
be
 
asking
 
each
 
participant
 
to
 
answer
 
questions
 
about
 
the

the
 
duration
 
of
 
participation
 
are
 
completely
 
understood
 
by
 
all
 
participants.
 
We
 
will
 
aim
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
specific
 
research
 
team
 
member
 
assigned
 
to
 
complete
 
all
 
sessions
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
participant.
 
However,
 
we
 
will
 
not
 
require
 
the
 
same
 
researcher
 
to
 
be
 
present
 
during
 
stimulation
 
sessions
 
2
 
through
 
4.
 
The
 
study
 
team
 
will
 
work
 
hard
 
at
 
forming
 
rapport
 
with
 
the
 
participant
 
so
 
they
 
feel
 
comfortable
 
and
 
willing
 
to
 
discuss
 
what
 
may
 
be
 
sensitive
 
information.
 
Retention
 
will
 
be
 
quantified
 
by
 
the
 
fraction
 
of
 
participants
 
coming
 
to
 
each
 
scheduled
 
session
 
(the
 
data
 
from
 
each
 
session
 
will
 
be
 
scored
 
and
 
documented
 
the
 
day
 
of
 
the
 
session).
    
  As this study requires several days of participation in a row, we will allow participants to miss one 
stimulation
 
session,
 
if
 
it
 
is
 
made
 
up
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
stimulation
 
week.
 
If
 
two
 
consecutive
 
stimulation
 
sessions
 
are
 
missed,
 
the
 
participant
 
will
 
be
 
withdrawn
 
from
 
participation.
 
This
 
schedule
 
would
 
permit
 
the
 
participant
 
to
 
still
 
receive
 
the
 
full
 
intervention
 
(5
 
days
 
of
 
stimulation)
 
without
 
being
 
withdrawn
 
from
 
the
 
study

to
 
unforeseen
 
circumstances
 
(e.g.,

designed
 
for
 
or
 
used
 
to
 
support

does
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
potential
 
for
 
serious
 
risk
 
to
 
the
 
health,

There
 
has

(tACS).
 
  Previous studies in the Frohlich lab that used the XCSITE 100 and comparable devices (i.e., the 
commercial,
 
CE-certified
 
Neuroconn

stimulator)
 
have
 
been
 
classified
 
as
 
“non-significant

and
 
the
 
XCSITE100
 
stimulator
 
are
 
electrically
 
equivalent
 
and
 
provide
 
the

While
 
the
 
Neuroconn
 
device
 
is
 
commercially
 
available,
 
it
 
cannot
 
be
 
pre-programmed
 
for

current
 
flows
 
through
 
this
 
resistor
 
and
 
creates
 
a
 
voltage.
 
The
 
voltage
 
across
 
this
 
resistor
 
is
 
sensed
 
and
 
amplified
 
by
 
the
 
AD628
 
difference
 
amplifier.
 
  Voltage Sensor Circuit. The differential voltage across the electrodes is measured so that the impedance 
can
 
be
 
calculated.
 
The

the
 
positive
 
electrode

using
 
the

circuit
 
described
 
in
 
the

section.
 
  The device is equipped with 4 different stages of safety precautions, all of which protect the participant 
from
 
high
 
currents.
 
The

If
 
the
 
current
 
exceeds
 
these
 
limits,

The
 
user
 
is

given
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
investigate
 
the

or
 
resume
 
the
 
test.
 
Since

is
 
used
 
(described
 
above),
 
any

A

completed
 
the

completed
 
both
 
a

a

With
 
approximately
 
9

in

a

was

power
 
on
 
the
 
fifth
 
day

(p

[6],
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
presumed
 
mechanism
 
of
 
action
 
of
 
closed-loop
 
tACS.
 
Therefore,
 
with
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
35

we
 
anticipate
 
we
 
will
 
find
 
a
 
significant
 
difference.

However, the expected effects of stimulation for secondary outcome measures at FU2 are currently 
unclear,
 
and
 
self-report
 
measures
 
tend

have
 
more

thus
 
reduced

To
 
that

we

reason
 
that
 
a

allows

is

effect

ɑ

In the previous trial, 80% of the participants completed all study sessions. We are thus anticipating 
consenting

35
 
people
 
to
 
reach
 
the
 
goal
 
of
 
28
 
people
 
for

NALYSIS 
OF 
THE S
ECONDARY E
NDPOINT (RESPONSE AND REMISSION RATE, FEASIBILITY)  We will compute the response and remission rates for the sample. There is no statistical testing 
applicable
 
for
 
this
 
outcome
 
since
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
groups
 
to
 
compare.
  We will compute the fraction of participants who complete stimulation by dividing the number of people 
who
 
received
 
5-days
 
of
 
stimulation
 
by
 
the
 
total
 
number
 
of
 
participants
 
who
 
received
 
any
 
amount
 
of
 
stimulation.
  As applicable, 95% confidence intervals will be computed to describe precision of the estimate.  10.4.4 S

adverse
 
effects
 
questionnaire,
 
and
 
the
 
Altman
 
Self-Rating
 
Mania
 
Scale
 
(ASRM).
  The C-SSRS will be used to assess suicide risk. If a participant's responses have an elevated risk, the 
participant
 
will
 
be

at
 
the
 
screening
 
visit
 
and
 
at
 
the
 
14-day
 
follow

  The stimulation questionnaire will be administered at D1-D5 after stimulation. This questionnaire solicits 
ratings
 
of

(“flickering
 
light”)
 
and
 
adverse

  The Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale (ASRM) will be used to assess any development of mania over the 
course
 
of
 
treatment.
 
A

spontaneously
 
reports
 
a

entirety.
 
At
 
several
 
intervals
 
during
 
the

review,
 
the
 
researcher
 
will
 
ask
 
questions
 
that
 
will
 
assess
 
the
 
comprehension
 
of
 
the

If
 
the

is
 
unsure
 
or
 
does
 
not
 
know,
 
the
 
researcher
 
will
 
return
 
to

will
 
not

3For subjects receiving bridging therapy, refer to Section 6 for bridging therapy details.
Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen 
consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day, administered 
x 3 days.  Refer to Section 6 for chemotherapy treatment details.
Procedures:
At specific time points as outlined in the schedule of assessments, subjects will undergo the following assessments/procedures: collection of informed consent, general medical history including previous treatments for NHL, physical exam including vital signs and performance status, neurologic assessments, blood draws for complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panels, cytokines, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte subsets, anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies, replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) and anti-CD19 CAR T cell analysis. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine or serum pregnancy test. 
Subjects will also undergo a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), brain 
magnetic resonance image (MRI), a positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT/CT), possible bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and leukapheresis.
Subjects will have lumbar punctures performed for the collection of CSF (see Section 11.9 and SOA) 
before and after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.
Routinely throughout the conduct of the study, subjects will be asked to report concomitant medications 
and adverse events and will have their disease assessed.
Methodology/Study Design: This is a Phase 2 single center, open-label study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of anakinra when combined with axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with refractory 
aggressive NHL.  
Phase 2 Study
The Phase 2 study will enroll approximately 20 subjects with refractory aggressive NHL. 
Each subject will proceed through the following study periods:
Screening
Enrollment/Leukapheresis period
Bridging therapy (if applicable)
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy period
Investigational Product (IP) treatment period
Post treatment assessment period
Long term follow-up period
For study requirements assigned to each study period, refer to Section 7 for details.Long-term Follow-up

DSMC & SRT
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity and accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of medical oncologists, research nurses, pharmacists and biostatisticians with direct experience in cancer clinical research. Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI, study team and Kite/Gilead. The DSMC will review protocols up to, but not more than four times a year with the primary focus being accrual, protocol adherence, audit results and summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow-up. Given the collaborative nature of this protocol, there will be an additional safety review team (SRT) comprised of the study sponsor/PI and Kite/Gilead meant to review all study safety data and be the primary driver of recommendations on further study conduct as described below.  .  
Refer to Section 13.2 and Section 8.4.4.
Statistical methods:
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens on the rate and 
severity of neurologic toxicities. With 20 patients the study will have 86% power to detect a decrease in the grade 2+ neurotoxicity rate from 45% to 15% via a two-sided exact binomial test with a significance level of 0.05. The secondary objectives of this study inclde analyses the rate and severity of CRS as well as efficacy endpoints (ORR, DOR, PFS, OS) and levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
and cytokines in the blood.

142.OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of anakinra as preventative management 
of neurotoxicity, as measured by the incidence and maximal grade, following axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with aggressive refractory NHL. 
The key secondary objectives include assessment of rate and severity of cytokine release 
syndrome and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
in terms of DOR, ORR, PFS, and OS .
Exploratory objectives to include comparison of Zuma-1 CRS/NT grading criteria to new ASBMT criteria, levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood, levels of cytokines in serum and CSF, incidence of anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies and other investigation of potential biomarker development based on assessment of blood cells, tumor cells and the proposed actions of the investigational product.
2.1 Study Design
Study 19-348 is a Phase 2 single center, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 
anakinra when combined with axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma.   
Approximately 20 subjects with aggressive refractory NHL, including DLBCL, PMBCL, high 
grade lymphoma or TFL will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of anakinra in combination with axicabtagene ciloleucel.  If the initial regimen is determined to be safe, the study may be expanded beyond the initial 20 patient cohort. A SRT comprised of the study sponsor and Kite/Gilead, will review the safety data and make recommendations on further study conduct
For study requirements assigned to each study period, please refer to the schedule of assessments 
(SOA) and Section 11 for details.
Each subject will proceed through the following study periods:
Screening
Enrollment/Leukapheresis period
Bridging therapy (if applicable)
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy period
Investigational Product (IP) treatment period
Post treatment assessment period
Long term follow-up period

3. BACKGROUND
3.1 Disease Background and Rationale
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of cancers originating in B 
lymphocytes, T lymphocytes or natural killer cells.  In the United States, B cell lymphomas represent 80-85% of cases reported.  In 2013, approximately 69,740 new cases of NHL and over 19,000 deaths related to the disease were estimated to occur.  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most prevalent hematological malignancy and is the seventh leading site of new cancers among men and women and account for 4% of all new cancer cases and 3% of deaths related to cancer 
2.  Large 
B-cell lymphomas represent the most common sub-group of NHL 3.
3.1.1 Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of large B-cell lymphoma, accounting for approximately 30% of NHL cases.  There are approximately 22,000 new diagnoses of DLBCL in the United States each year.  In the past two decades, progress has been made in understanding the biological heterogeneity of DLBCL and in improving survival with combinations of CHOP and immunotherapy.  The addition of rituximab into combination therapies for DLBCL have greatly improved patient outcomes.  However, patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL following treatment under the current standards of care still have a particularly dire prognosis, with no curative treatment options

The population with the highest unmet need continues to consist of patients who do not respond to first line combination chemotherapy (typically R-CHOP) or who do not respond to their last course of combination chemotherapy, as the disease is mostly insensitive to subsequent combination chemotherapy (typically R-ICE, R-ESHAP) (Table 1).  In a review of 64 patients with DLBCL with disease progression during first line chemotherapy or only transient response

16(≤90 days) after end of induction treatment, the response rate to second line therapy was 15% and 
the median overall survival (OS) was 6 months, and no patient survived more than 26 months after first diagnosis 
5.  An analysis of outcome in 1126 patients with DLBCL after first line R-CHOP 
included 33 patients with primary refractory DLBCL who received second line therapy with curative intent.  Only 3 (9%) patients were able to receive autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and only 1 (3%) patient achieved long term survival 
6.  Seshadri et al analyzed 120 
patients who did not respond to second line platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (e.g., R-ICE) and showed that only 14% responded to their third line therapy 
7.  Ardeshna et al followed 19 
patients with large B-cell lymphoma, and 9 patients with TFL who did not respond to second line chemotherapy.  Only 5 of the 28 total patients (18%) responded to third line chemotherapy

These consistently discouraging results demonstrate that new treatment options are urgently needed for patients whose tumors have demonstrated a lack of response to chemotherapy.  
3.1.2 Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma and Transformed Follicular Lymphoma
Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) has distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular 
characteristics compared to DLBCL.  PMBCL is thought to arise from thymic (medullary) B cells and represents approximately 3% of patients diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma.  PMBCL is typically identified in the younger adult population in the fourth decade of life with a slight female predominance 
14,15.  Gene expression profiling suggests deregulated pathways in PMBCL overlap 
with Hodgkin lymphoma.  Initial therapy of PMBCL generally includes anthracycline-containing regimens with rituximab with or without involved field radiotherapy.  A recent Phase 2, prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) demonstrated radiotherapy may not be required 
16.
Follicular lymphoma (FL), a B cell lymphoma, is the most common indolent (slow-growing) form of NHL, accounting for approximately 20% to 30% of all NHLs.  Some patients with FL will transform (TFL) histologically to DLBCL which is more aggressive and associated with a poor outcome.  Histological transformation to DLBCL occurs at an annual rate of approximately 3%

17for 15 years with the risk of transformation continuing to drop in subsequent years.  The biologic 
mechanism of histologic transformation is unknown.  Initial treatment of TFL is influenced by prior therapies for follicular lymphoma but generally includes anthracycline-containing regimens with rituximab to eliminate the aggressive component of the disease 
17.  
Treatment options for relapsed/refractory PMBCL and TFL are similar to those in DLBCL.  Given the low prevalence of these diseases, no large prospective randomized studies in these patient populations have been conducted.  Patients with chemotherapy refractory disease have a similar or worse prognosis 
18 to those with refractory DLBCL.  
In addition, the international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research (SCHOLAR-1) study retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with chemorefractory DLBCL, PMBCL, and TFL.  SCHOLAR-1 integrated data from two Phase 3 studies (LYSARC-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic/University of Iowa Specialized Program of Research Excellence).  Among 861 patients, 635 were included based on chemorefractory search criteria.  Outcomes were consistently poor, regardless of refractory subgroup and across cohorts.  The results of SCHOLAR-1 indicated that patients with chemorefractory, aggressive DLBCL represent a homogenous patient population with a response rate of 26% (complete response [CR] rate of 7%) and median overall survival of 6.3 months 
19.
3.1.3 High Grade B-cell Lymphoma
In 2016, the World Health Organization introduced a new category of large B-cell lymphomas 
called high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) 20.  This designation includes large B-cell 
lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements that are phenotypically intermediate to DLBCL or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable (this latter category has since been eliminated).  MYC rearrangements in large B-cell lymphomas are associated with a poor prognosis that is worsened in cases of concomitant BCL2 and/or BCL6 alterations, ie, double- or triple-hit lymphomas.  As such, patients with HGBCL are likely to face poor survival outcomes.
3.2 T cell Therapy for Aggressive Refractory Lymphomas
3.2.1 Axicabtagene Ciloleucel
Axicabtagene ciloleucel are anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) autologous human T cells 
that have been engineered to express an extracellular single chain variable fragment (scFv) with specificity for CD19 linked to an intracellular signaling part comprised of signaling domains from CD28 and CD3ζ (CD3-zeta) molecules arranged in tandem (Figure 2). 
An anti-CD19 CAR vector construct was previously designed, optimized and initially tested at the 
Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI, IND 13871) (Figure 2.) 
21,22.  The scFv is 
derived from the variable region of the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody FMC63 23.  A portion of 
the CD28 costimulatory molecule is added, as murine models suggest this is important for the anti-tumor effect and persistence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
24.  The signaling domain of the CD3-zeta

18chain is essential for T cell activation.  These fragments were cloned into the murine stem cell 
virus-based (MSGV1) vector, utilized to genetically engineer the autologous T cells.  
Kite Pharma performed larger scale clinical development of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells, 
and named this therapeutic engineered cell product axicabtagene ciloleucel. Treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel was FDA approved in 2017 based on data from the Zuma-1 study which demonstrated objective response rates upwards of 83%, with a median OS that has not been reached (Locke, Lancet Oncology 2018).  Real world data of axicabtagene has demonstrated similarly robust response rates and durability, but further emphasized the need for improved toxicity management. This real world experience demonstrated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
and neurotoxicty rates of 96% and 76% with grade ≥ 3 events seen in 17% and 38% respectively 
(Jacobson et al, ASH 2018).  
Figure 2. Axicabtagene Ciloleucel 
3.3 CRS, Neurotoxicity Management and IL-1
The primary acute toxicities observed to date with CAR T cells have been CRS and neurotoxicity. CRS is defined as a constellation of symptoms which may include (but are not limited to) fever, 
chills, hypotension, hypoxia, and when extreme, macrophage activation syndrome. Manifestations 
of neurotoxicity vary and include confusion, obtundation, seizures, hallucinations, aphasia, ataxia, 
and more rarely, profound cerebral edema25. The future success and application of commercial 
product to a broader population of patients is limited by the frequency and severity of these

19toxicities. CRS is managed in the inpatient setting with administration of the anti-IL6 receptor 
antibody tocilizumab, with or without steroids, only after the onset of CRS in the setting of clinical decline
25. The CRS associated with CAR T cells shares many pathogenic features of macrophage 
activation syndrome26. CAR-T related neurotoxicity is thought to be cytokine mediated in the 
setting of macrophage and endothelial activation and is predominantly managed with steroids alone
27, because tocilizumab has no therapeutic efficacy against CAR T cell-related neurotoxicity. 
Tocilizumab has been studied in the prophylactic setting as part of the third cohort of ZUMA-1; these data showed that despite improvement in the incidence of CRS, investigators found that there was an increase in the incidence of severe neurotoxicity. This was felt to be related to the poor CNS penetration of tocilizumab, which may have led to increased intracerebral levels of IL-6.
28
Given these findings, other targets within the IL-6 inflammatory pathway have been explored for the management of macrophage activation and cytokine release syndrome. Anakinra, a human interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis related macrophage activation syndrome, as well as in recent mouse models of CRS and neurotoxicity in which lethal CRS and neurotoxicity were abrogated with the use of anakinra (figure 3) 
29-31. We also have anecdotal experience with the use of anakinra to treat 
tocilizumab-refractory cytokine release syndrome, and have noted improvements in neurologic function. These data suggest that IL-1 blockade may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of both CRS and neurotoxicity. Furthermore, it does not appear that IL-1 activity is required to maintain CAR-T cell efficacy.
3.3.1 Anakinra
Anakinra is a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1ra). Endogenous IL-1 is induced 
by inflammatory stimuli and mediates various immunological responses. Anakinra can be administered subcutaneously. Anakinra is currently FDA approved for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Sub-cutaneous and intravenous administration of anakinra have been studied in multiple contexts. 
Anakinra was administered intravenously to patients with sepsis in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the 1990s
32-34. In these trials, rhIL-1ra was administered using different 
regimens; all included an intravenous (IV) loading dose of 100 mg administered over about 60 seconds and followed by an IV infusion administered every 8 or 12 h by a volumetric infusion 
Figure 3. Anakinra, but not tocilizumab, abolishes neurotoxicity in 
a SGM3 mouse model of CRS and neurotoxicity.  (Norelli et al. 2018)

20pump at a constant rate (17-133 mg/h, n=74, or 1- 2 mg/kg/h, n=941) for 72 h. The frequencies of 
(serious) adverse events were not significantly different between the treatment and placebo groups. No unique clinical or laboratory adverse events were significantly more frequent in the anakinra-treated patients compared to the placebo group, and there was no evidence of delayed resolution of infection or increased frequency of secondary infections in the anakinra-treated group
34. Before 
these trials of rhIL-1ra in sepsis, a phase I study of rhIL-1Ra administered intravenously at different doses had been conducted in 25 healthy individuals, generating safety and pharmacokinetic data
35. In this study, the authors had found no clinically significant differences in 
clinical, hematological, biochemical, or endocrinological parameters between the groups receiving anakinra or saline. The only reaction occurred in one volunteer who developed a mild, transient case of hepatitis. 
Additional placebo controlled, randomized trials have occurred designed to assess the safety of 
patients receiving anakinra monotherapy and combinations with other immunosuppressive agents. One such study by Fleischmann et al. included 1414 patients receiving a variety of concurrent medications for RA including some disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), as well as patients who were DMARD-free. Concurrent DMARDs included MTX, sulfasalazine, 
hydroxychloroquine, gold, penicillamine, leflunomide, and azathioprine. Although Serious 
infectious episodes were observed more frequently in the anakinra group (2.1% versus 0.4% in the 
placebo group), this was ultimately felt to be secondary to combination with other 
immunosuppressive agents and therefore should be monitored36.
Several pharmacokinetic studies have been performed for subcutaneous treatment. In subjects with RA, maximum plasma concentrations of anakinra occurred 3 to 7 hours after subcutaneous administration of anakinra at clinically relevant doses (1 to 2 mg/kg; n = 18); the terminal half-life ranged from 4 to 6 hours. In RA patients, no unexpected accumulation of Kineret was observed after daily subcutaneous doses for up to 24 weeks. The mean plasma clearance of Kineret in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min) renal insufficiency was reduced by 16% and 50%, respectively and no significant dose reduction was recommended upon FDA approval. 
Refer to the most recent version of the package insert from the FDA label for additional details 
surrounding the anakinra.
3.4 Correlative Studies Background
Correlative studies will be performed on peripheral blood, bone marrow/tumor biopsies and, if available, CSF samples to evaluate PK/PD markers related to safety and/or efficacy. The effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel T cells may depend on the expansion and persistence of CAR T cells in subjects. Therefore, the expansion and persistence will be monitored by flow cytometry and PCR analysis using peripheral blood samples as per standard SOPs. Samples will be collected per the protocol Schedule of Events (see 11.1 Schedule of Events). Periodic 
monitoring of anti-inflammatory cytokines secretion will be performed to determine correlation between axicabtagene ciloleucel efficacy and/or toxicity; in addition,  CD19 expression on tumor cells will be evaluated at the eligibility and in subjects failing to achieve a complete response.

21Additional testing may be done depending on the clinical condition; for instance, patients with 
symptoms suggestive of cytokine release syndrome or with skin rash or other findings that may concern the investigators may have more frequent monitoring to enhance the safety of this trial. 
If tumor tissues or bone marrow aspirates become available as part of routine clinical care, a 
sample will be collected for research analysis. Tissue samples will be analyzed for the presence of axicabtage ciloleucel T cells by PCR and/or flow cytometry. Additionally, different T cell subsets  have demonstrated different effector function and persistence and, therefore, T cell immunophenotyping will be performed by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood samples will be analyzed for cytokine/chemokine levels by multiplex bead array technology. Tumor tissue will be analyzed for CD19 expression by immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry. Additional clinical samples testing may be performed based on the Exploratory Endpoints as listed in Section 
2.4.
All research samples will be delivered, processed, and frozen as per SOP to either Kite/Gilead (for 
VCN and cytokine analysis) or the Maus/Immune Monitoring Laboratory at the MGH Cancer Center for storage and bulk analyses (all other correlative studies). Documentation of sample receipt, processing, and storage and primary data from the research analyses will be collected and stored by the Immune Monitoring Lab personnel. All research analyses will be performed based on assay-specific SOP using qualified assays.

5.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of any protocol-specific therapy or intervention. Any participant not registered to the protocol before protocol-specific therapy or intervention begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied. The registration process includes registration of the participant for study related, as well as initiation of treatment plan related activities. An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the protocol-specific eligibility checklist. This does not include registration with Kite/Gilead for manufacturing of axicabtagene ciloleucel which will be performed separately by study staff via Kite IPM. 
Following registration, participants may begin protocol-specific therapy and/or intervention. 
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If the subject does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the subject must be taken off-study in the CTMS (OnCore) with an appropriate date and reason entered.

antagonist of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor. Endogenous IL-1 is induced by inflammatory stimuli and mediates various immunological responses. Anakinra will be administered subcutaneously via pre-filled syringes. The dose, schedule, and route of administration of anakinra on this protocol is described in section 6.4.3. Anakinra is currently approved for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and rheumatoid arthritis. Refer to the most recent version of the package insert from the FDA label for specific details surrounding the administration of anakinra.
6.2 Treatment Regimen
6.2.1 Chemotherapy General Instructions
Subjects will receive a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in order to induce lymphocyte depletion and create an optimal environment for expansion of axicabtagene ciloleucel in vivo.  Subjects will initiate 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine beginning on Day -5 through Day -3.  The 3-day lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen may be administered in an outpatient setting.  
Subjects should be instructed to drink plenty of liquids during and for 24 hours following the 
chemotherapy.  In general, subjects should be kept well-hydrated but closely monitored to prevent fluid overload. 
6.2.2 Axicabtagene Ciloleucel General instructions
All subjects will receive axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion at a healthcare facility, followed by daily 
monitoring at a healthcare facility for at least 7 days to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities.  Subjects should be instructed to remain within proximity of the clinical study site for at least 4 weeks following axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Subjects and their family members/caregivers should be educated on potential CRS and neurologic symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, confusion, aphasia, dysphasia, somnolence, encephalopathy, ataxia, or tremor.  Subjects or their family members/caregivers should be instructed to immediately contact the treating investigator or seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms develop. 
Alternatively, subjects may be hospitalized to receive their axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and 
be observed for CRS and neurologic toxicities in the hospital setting, if deemed appropriate by the investigator.

27If subjects are hospitalized, subjects should not be discharged from the hospital until all 
axicabtagene ciloleucel-related non-hematological toxicities resolve to ≤ Grade 1 or return to baseline.  Subjects may be discharged with non-critical and clinically stable or improving toxicities (e.g., renal insufficiency) even if > Grade 1, if deemed appropriate by the investigator.  Subjects should remain in a hospital for ongoing axicabtagene ciloleucel-related fever, hypotension, hypoxia, or ongoing neurologic toxicities > Grade 1, or if deemed necessary by the investigator. 
All patients should be started on levetiracetam 750mg (PO or IV) twice daily starting day of 
infusion. 
The following medications should be administered approximately 1 hour prior to axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion.  Alternatives to the recommendations below should be discussed with the medical monitor.
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO
Diphenhydramine (12.5 to 25 mg IV or 25 mg PO)
Central venous access, such as a port or a peripherally inserted central catheter, is required for the administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Catheter care, per institutional guidelines, should be followed.  Materials and instructions for the thawing, timing, and administering of axicabtagene ciloleucel are outlined Section 9.  
Research sites should follow institutional guidelines for the infusion of cell products.6.2.3 Anakinra General Instructions: 
All subjects will receive anakinra subcutaneous injections at a healthcare facility as in section 
6.4.3.  In brief, patients will receive their first dose 4 hours (+/- 30 min) prior to CAR-T cell infusion on day 0 and daily thereafter through D+13. Specific dosing strategy is detailed in section 6.4.3. 
6.3 Rationale for Study Treatment Dosing 
6.3.1 Rationale for Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy 
Increasing levels of lymphodepleting chemotherapy correlates with clinical responses to adoptive cell therapy 
38.  Specifically, there appears to be a link between adequate lymphodepletion and 
adoptively transferred T cell expansion and function in pre-clinical models.  The depth and duration of the lymphodepletion in preclinical models correlate with anti-tumor activity of the adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD8+ T cells 
39.  Lymphodepletion may function by 
eradicating cytokine sinks for the transferred cells, eliminating T regulatory cells, or enhancing antigen presenting cell activation 
40.  Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine is a potent 
lymphodepleting regimen.  Optimizing the doses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to improve the depth and duration of lymphodepletion may enhance the activity of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  
As per the FDA approved label for axicabtagene ciloleucel, the lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
dose in will be cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m
2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) both given for 
3 concurrent days with the target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  Cyclophosphamide

28(500 mg/m2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) both given for 3 concurrent days has been studied and 
tolerated in subjects with B cell malignancies 41.  
6.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population to be Included in Phase 2 Study
The proposed patient population mirrors that of Zuma-1, a multicenter phase 2 study of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel in relapsed/refractory large cell lymphoma that led to FDA approval. Additionally, based on real-world experience, less stringent eligibility criteria have demonstrated comparable outcomes when compared to Zuma-1.
6.3.3 Rationale for using Anakinra
Cytokine release syndrome is driven by a multitude of inflammatory cytokines culminating in 
varying degrees of macrophage activation syndrome and clinical CRS. Currently, IL-6R targeting therapy is the standard of care for the management of CRS
42. Pre-clinical data suggest that while 
IL-6 is a primary mediator of CRS and possibly neurotoxicity, IL-6R targeting is insufficient to prevent these toxicities
29,43. CRS and neurotoxicity prophylaxis has been attempted with 
tocilizumab and although lower rates of CRS were observed, high, if not higher rates of Grade 4+ neurotoxicity were seen (Locke ASH 2017). IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been targeted in various inflammatory states including rheumatoid arthritis and refractory macrophage activation syndromes
30,44.  Recent animal data has demonstrated that IL-1 plays a key role in CRS 
and neurotoxicity and may even prime the myeloid compartment for subsequent IL-6 signaling and activation. Anakinra dosed subcutaneously can achieve 95% bioavailability with a time to peak of 3 to 7 hours, making it ideal for daily prophylactic dosing. Weight based dosing of anakinra 
at 100 mg (if <50kg) vs 200 mg (if ≥50kg) was selected based on currently approved dosing as 
well as substantial clinical data demonstrating safety at doses beyond 200mg45. Daily dosing was 
selected given the short half-life of Anakinra and ongoing cytokine production during CAR-T expansion, as seen in pre-clinical animal models and prior clinical trial experience
29. 
6.4 T cell Therapy and Anakinra Administration
6.4.1 Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Subjects will receive the 3-day lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen followed by 2-day rest 
period (48 hrs):
IV hydration with 1L of 0.9% NaCl (or isotonic [crystalloid] fluid) given prior to 
cyclophosphamide on the day of infusion followed by:
Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes on Day -5, Day -4, and Day -3 followed 
by:
Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes on Day -5, Day -4, and Day -3 followed by:
An additional 1L of 0.9% NaCl (or isotonic [crystalloid] fluid) at the completion of the 
fludarabine infusion 
Add mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate) per institutional guidelines

296.4.2 Axicabtagene ciloleucel Administration
Axicabtagene ciloleucel will be administered at a target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells/kg.  Subjects who receive doses between 1-2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg will be 
included in the mITT analysis set.  For subjects weighing greater than 100 kg, a maximum flat 
dose of 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be administered.
As part of the FDA REMS requirement, an appropriate REMS specific medication guide and patient identification card will be supplied to the patient prior to axicabtagene infusion.  
6.4.3 Anakinra administration
Anakinra will be administered on days 0 through D+13 as detailed below. 
Anakinra dosing strategy: 
Patients will be given their first dose of Anakinra 4 hours (+/- 30 min) prior to CAR-T 
infusion on day 0.  
Patients will start with subcutaneous Anakinra as a weight based dose.

@ Anakinra will be administered sub-cutaneously per weight based dosing (100mg SQ for subjects <50kg and 200mg 
SQ for subjects ≥50 kg.). Dosing allowed +/- 30 min of 4 hour window. 
Additional doses of anakinra following D+13 will not be provided unless discussed with the principal investigator. It is acceptable to give tocilizumab, steroids or 3
rd line agents for the 
management of CRS in combination with anakinra per institutional guidelines. 
6.5 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
During the course of the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatment deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except those medications listed in Section 6.6. This includes following institutional guidelines for standard management of CRS and neurotoxicity, including use of tocilizumab and/or high dose steroids as per appendix A.  
All concurrent therapies, including medications, intubation, dialysis, oxygen, and blood products, 
will be recorded from the date of the informed consent through 1 month after completing treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel.  After 1 month of follow-up, only targeted concomitant medication will be collected for 24 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or disease progression, whichever occurs first.  Targeted concomitant medications include gammaglobulin,

30immunosuppressive drugs, anti-infective drugs, and vaccinations.  
For subjects who are enrolled but not dosed with axicabtagene ciloleucel, concurrent therapies will 
only be recorded from the date of the informed consent through 30 days after the last study specific procedure (e.g., leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy).  For subjects who are not enrolled (e.g., screen failure or not leukapheresed), only concurrent therapies related to any serious adverse event(s) will be recorded.
Specific concomitant medication collection requirements and instructions are included in the case 
report form (CRF) completion guidelines.
6.6 Excluded Medications
Corticosteroid therapy at a pharmacologic dose (≥ 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids) and other immunosuppressive drugs must be avoided for 7 days prior to leukapheresis, and 5 days prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel administration. 
Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs should also be avoided for 3 months after 
axicabtagene ciloleucel administration, unless used to manage axicabtagene ciloleucel related toxicities. Other medications that might interfere with the evaluation of the axicabtagene ciloleucel in combination with the investigational product, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents should also be avoided for the same time period unless medically necessary.  
Treatment for lymphoma such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted agents, radiation, and 
high dose corticosteroid, other than defined/allowed in this protocol, and other investigational agents are prohibited, except as needed for treatment of disease progression after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.
6.7 Subsequent Therapy 
Subsequent therapy administered after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion for a subject’s disease, such as non-study specified chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted agents, as well as stem cell transplant and radiation therapy, will be recorded until the subject completes the long-term follow-up period, is considered lost to follow-up, withdraws consent, or dies.  
6.8 Duration of Follow Up
Long-term Follow-up PeriodAll enrolled subjects will be followed in the long-term follow-up period for survival and disease status, if applicable.  Subjects will begin the long-term follow-up period after they have completed the Month 3 visit of the post treatment assessment period (whether they have responded to treatment or went straight to the Month 3 visit due to disease progression) 
Every 3 months (± 2 weeks) through Month 18
Every 6 months (± 1 month) between Month 24

Following Month 24 patients, protocol long-term followup will continue through the  CIBMTR immune effector cell therapy registry as part of the FDA mandated 15-year follow-up period. 
6.9 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study
6.9.1 Subject Withdrawal
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution.
Subjects can decline to continue to receive study required treatment and/or other protocol required 
procedures at any time during the study but continue to participate in the study.  This is referred to as partial withdrawal of consent.
If partial withdrawal of consent occurs, the investigator must discuss with the subject the 
appropriate process for discontinuation from investigational product, study treatment or other protocol required therapies and must discuss options for continued participation, completion of procedures and the associated data collection as outlined in the SOA. The level of follow-up and method of communication should also be discussed between the research staff and the subject and documented in the source documents.
Withdrawal of full consent from a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol required therapy or undergo procedures and the subject does not wish to continue further study follow-up.  Subject data collected up to withdrawal of consent will be retained and included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted by local regulations, publicly available data (death records) can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study. 
As part of the study sites may be asked to conduct searches of public records, such as those 
establishing survival status, if available, to obtain survival data for any subject for whom the survival status is not known. Sites may be also asked to also retrieve autopsy reports to confirm status of disease at the time of death. 
The investigator and/or sponsor can also decide to withdraw a subject from the investigational 
product and/or other protocol-required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study as a whole or at any time prior to study completion.
6.9.2 Reasons for Removal from Treatment
Reasons for removal from protocol required investigational products or procedures include any of 
the following:
Adverse Event
Subject request
Product not available

6.9.3 Reasons for Removal from Study
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study are as follows:
Subject withdrawal of consent from further follow-up
Investigator decision
Lost to follow-up 
Death
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF). In addition, the study team will ensure Off Treatment/Off Study information is updated in OnCore in accordance with DF/HCC policy REGIST-101.
7. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
In the case of medical or natural emergencies (i.e. holidays, snowstorms, acute infection) occurring 
after initiation of chemotherapy, the infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel may be delayed up to one week at the investigator’s discretion. Subjects who do not initiate chemotherapy within 4 weeks of enrollment will be withdrawn; however, their CAR T cell product will be stored for up to 1 year if they re-enroll at a later date. No modifications to the doses will be made at the physician level. 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP websitehttp://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. CTCAE 4.03 was 
chosen given its utilization during the Zuma-1 study which will act as a historical control. 
8. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
8.1 Expected Toxicities
To date, the following important risks have been identified with axicabtagene ciloleucel:  CRS, 
neurologic toxicities, infections, and cytopenias.  
Anakinra has been associated with an increased incidence of serious infections (2%) vs. Placebo 
(< 1%) in clinical trials in RA. Treatment with anakinra should not be initiated in patients with active infections. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema, have been reported with anakinra. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of

DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-348
Protocol Version Date: 26AUG2021
33anakinra should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. Patients receiving anakinra may 
experience a decrease in neutrophil counts. Neutrophil counts should therefore be assessed prior to initiating anakinra treatment. 
8.2 Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  The event does not necessarily have a relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. AE reporting will not begin until day 0 of the cellular therapy infusion, unless felt to be directly related to a study related procedure during the leukapheresis and/or lymphodepletion period. 
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration or has an association with a worse outcome.  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event.
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (such as elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study participation are not considered adverse events.  Hospitalization for study treatment infusions or precautionary measures per institutional policy are not considered adverse events.
The term “disease progression” as assessed by measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs 
or other methods should not be reported as adverse events.  Death due to disease progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type (e.g., B-Cell Lymphoma). 
For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the disease under 
investigation report the signs and symptoms.  Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should also be reported as adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF. 
The investigators clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from 
treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject request to withdraw from protocol required therapies or the study due to an adverse event, the subject should undergo the procedures outlined in the Month 3 visit of the SOA. 
8.2.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious 
criteria:
Fatal
Life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

34Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Other medically important serious event
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization” if the event necessitated 
an admission to a healthcare facility (eg, overnight stay). 
Events that require an escalation of care when the subject is already hospitalized should be 
recorded as a serious adverse event. Examples of such events include movement from routine care in the hospital to the ICU or if that event resulted in a prolongation of the existing planned hospitalization. 
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the 
serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event with the criterion of “other medically important serious event.” 
8.3
Adverse Event Characteristics
Adverse Event Assessment
For all AEs, the Investigator must determine both the severity of the AE and the relationship of 
the AE to CAR T cells treatment.
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in 
the revise NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 will be utilized for AE reporting of all toxicities (including neurotoxicity) EXCEPT for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which will use Lee 2014 
48 criteria.  All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.03.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
For expedited reporting purposes only: 
o AEs for agents utilized in this study should be reported only if the adverse event varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected toxicity information which is provided. 
oOther AEs for the protocol that do not require reporting are outlined in the next section (Expedited Adverse Event Reporting) and under the sub-heading of Protocol-Specific Expedited Adverse Event Exclusions.
Attribution of the AE: 
oDefinite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
oProbable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
oPossible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.
oUnlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.
oUnrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.

358.4 Procedures for AE and SAE Collection and Reporting  
8.4.1 Reporting of Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for reporting adverse events directly related to study related 
procedures following study registration (leukapheresis) which includes mandated biopsies, lumbar punctures and/or lab draws. Following enrollment (cellular therapy infusion and initiation of anakinra), the investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur from through 3 months after treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, and investigational product use, are monitored and reported.  After 3 months, targeted adverse events including (eg, neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary malignancies) will be monitored and reported for 24 months after treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel, and investigational product use, or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.
For subjects who are enrolled, but do not receive axicabtagene ciloleucel, and/or the investigational 
product, the adverse event reporting period ends 30 days after the last study-specific procedure (eg, leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy). 
The investigator must address the below for adverse events: 
Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome (if not known, signs or symptoms)
Dates of onset and resolution
Severity
Assessment of relatedness to investigational product, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, 
axicabtagene ciloleucel or study procedures
Action taken
In reviewing adverse events, investigators must assess whether the adverse event is possibly 
related to 1) the investigational product (anakinra), 2) lymphodepleting chemotherapy, 3) axicabtagene ciloleucel or 4) any protocol-required study procedure.  The relationship is indicated by a yes or no response and entered into the CRF.  A yes response should indicate that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment or procedure and the adverse event.  Additional relevant data with respect to describing the adverse event will be collected in the CRFs.
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an 
abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, abnormal laboratory findings that result in new or worsening clinical sequelae, require therapy or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event.

Protocol Version Date: 26AUG2021
36The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or resolution.  If 
a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period for non-serious 
adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started.
8.4.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Non-serious CRS events Grade ≥ 3
The investigator is responsible for reporting all serious adverse events observed by the investigator 
or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the consent through 3 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  After 3 months, only serious targeted adverse events (e.g., neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary malignancies) observed by the investigator or reported by the subject will be reported for 24 months afteraxicabtagene ciloleucelinfusion or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.   For subjects who screen fail or are enrolled but do not receive axicabtagene ciloleucel, and/or anakinra, the 
reporting period for serious adverse events ends 30 days after the last procedure (e.g., screen procedure, leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy).  
Serious events that the investigator assesses as related to axicabtagene ciloleucel and/or 
anakinra should be reported regardless of the study period.
All serious adverse events and non-serious CRS events ≥ Grade 3 
48 must be submitted within 24 
hours following the investigators knowledge of the event using a Medwatch Report Form. For 
all SAE’s, submit Medwatch Report forms to the IND  Sponsor, health authorities per local 
reporting guidelines, and Kite/Gilead (Safety_FC@gilead.com). Progression of the malignancy 
during the study should not be reported as a serious adverse event. Adverse events associated with disease progression may be reported as serious adverse event.  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome within 3 months of the last day of the lymphodepleting therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel, or investigational product then the event leading to death must be recorded as a serious adverse event with CTCAE Grade 5.
Death must be reported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period, irrespective 
of any intervening treatment.
Any death occurring after the first dose of chemotherapy, for the purpose of pre-lymphodepletion, 
and within 3 months of the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, regardless of attribution to treatment, requires expedited reporting within 24 hours.  Any death occurring greater than 3 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is considered related to treatment.
8.4.3 Pregnancy and Lactation
There is no relevant clinical experience with axicabtagene ciloleucel and anakinra in pregnant or 
lactating women, and animal reproductive studies have not been performed.  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment because of the potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus.

10. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES
10.1 Biomarker Studies
N/A, no biomarker studies.
10.2 Laboratory Correlative Studies
Biomarker analysis will be performed on blood and tumor samples to evaluate predictive and pharmacodynamic markers for axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Prognostic markers specific for large B-cell lymphoma and related to the tumor immune environment may also be evaluated in archived and fresh tumor biopsies. 
The presence, expansion, persistence, and immunophenotype of transduced anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells will be monitored in the blood primarily by PCR analysis, complemented by flow cytometry.  Expansion and persistence in peripheral blood will also be monitored by a CD19 CAR specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR).  
Levels of serum cytokines will be evaluated in serum to characterize the pharmacodynamic and 
safety profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel in combination with anakinra.  The following pro-inflammatory, homeostatic and immune modulating cytokines may be included in the panel:  IL-
6, IL-15, IL-17a, TNF-, GM-CSF, IFN-, IL-12p40/p70 and IL-13; immune effector molecules: 
Granzyme A, B and Perforin; correlates of acute phase response: CRP and SAA; Chemokines 
MIP-1, MIP-1β, MCP-1, IP-10, and IL-8.  In addition, IL1Ra, IL2Rα and ferritin, will also be 
measured.   
Lumbar punctures for collection of CSF samples will be performed at the following time points:  
after eligibility is confirmed and prior to start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion on Day 5 (± 3 days), and at the Week 4 visit (± 3 days).  Collection of CSF samples will enable measurement of baseline cytokine levels prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Changes in levels of cytokines after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion will be measured at the time of peak CAR T-cell expansion (Day 5) and at Week 4 when it is anticipated that cytokine levels would return to baseline levels.  Infiltration of CAR T cells will also be

Additional translational samples of PBMC, serum cytokines, tissue, bone marrow, and CSF may 
be taken for additional genomics sequencing, RNA expression profiling, cytokine/biomarker analysis and flow cytometry, and tumor profiling. This may also include tumor samples for genomic, transcriptional and protein expression analysis. Samples will be analyzed at the MGH Immuno Monitoring Laboratory. 
11. STUDY CALENDAR
Assessments must be performed prior to administration of any study agent. Study assessments and 
agents should be administered within + 3 days of the protocol-specified date, unless otherwise 
noted.
Research staff should refer to the SOAs for an outline of the procedures required.  The visit 
schedule is calculated from axicabtagene ciloleucel  infusion on Day 0. An overview of study 
assessments/procedures is outlined below.  
11.1 Informed Consent
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the study design, anticipated benefits and the potential risks.  Subjects should sign the most current IRB/IEC approved ICF prior to any study specific activity or procedure is performed.
The consent process and the subject’s agreement or refusal to participate in the study is to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records.  If the subject agrees to participate, the ICF is to be signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  The original signed ICF will be retained in accordance with institution policy and IRB/IEC requirements with a copy of the ICF provided to the subject.
All subjects who are enrolled into the study should be re-consented with any updated version of 
the IRB/IEC approved ICF if relevant to their participation in the study.
11.2 Demographic Data
Demographic data will be collected to include sex, age, race, ethnicity, and country of enrollment 
to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.

typically shared in a referral letter.  All findings will be recorded in the CRFs.In addition to the medical history, all history related to the subject’s disease, treatment and response to treatment will be collected and must date back to the original diagnosis.For subjects who are being referred from another clinic or institution to the participating research center, copies from the subjects chart should be obtained.
11.4 Physical Exam, Vital Signs, Performance Status
Physical and neurological exams will be performed during screening and at times noted in the SOA.  Changes noted in subsequent exams when compared to the baseline exam will be reported as an adverse event. 
Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature will be 
monitored before and after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and then routinely per 
institutional guidelines.  If the subject has a fever (temperature 38.0
oC or greater), vital signs will 
be monitored more frequently as clinically indicated.
Performance status as measured by the ECOG scale will be performed to quantify the subject’s 
general well-being and ability to perform activities of daily life.
11.5 Neurological Assessment 
Neurological assessments will include ICE scores as per the schedule of assessments. In addition, standardized assessments using IPCG guidelines will be used in collaboration with neuro-oncology. A full neurological assessment will be completed during screening to establish a baseline.  Subsequent assessments will be performed before axicabtagene ciloleucel administration at screening, Month 1 and Month 3 visits. 
11.6 Cardiac Function 
Each subject’s cardiac function, as measured by ECHO will be assessed during the screening period to confirm study eligibility.  Both LVEF and pericardial effusion will be assessed prior to study entrance by ECHO.  An ECHO performed following the subjects last chemotherapy treatment and within 28 days prior to signing the consent may be used for confirmation of eligibility. To establish a baseline, an ECG will also be performed during the screening period. 
11.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Each subject will undergo a screening brain MRI to rule out CNS metastasis during the screening period of the study.  Evaluation of any new onset of ≥ Grade 2 neurologic toxicities should include a brain MRI as described in Section 6.4.

ciloleucel, a follow-up bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be performed in subjects presenting with bone marrow involvement prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with lymphoma after treatment.  To confirm a complete response, the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must show no evidence of disease by morphology or if indeterminate by morphology it must be negative by immunohistochemistry.  Refer to Section 12 and Appendix B for treatment response assessment 
requirements per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
1.  Bone marrow 
aspirate/biopsy should also be considered to evaluate HLH.  A portion of the bone marrow sample collected to evaluate HLH or other toxicities should be submitted to the central laboratory as outlined in the central laboratory manual. 
11.9 Lumbar Puncture
Subjects with symptoms of central nervous system malignancy such as new onset severe headaches, neck stiffness, or any focal neurologic findings on physical exam will have lumbar puncture performed at the screening visit for examination of cerebral spinal fluid.  In addition, lumbar puncture may be performed as applicable for subjects with new onset of ≥ Grade 2 neurologic toxicities after axicabtagene ciloleucelinfusion (see Section 8).
Lumbar punctures for the collection of CSF samples will be performed pre- and post-axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion at times outlined in the SOA.  Samples will be submitted to the central laboratory as outlined in the central laboratory manual.  Adequate platelet support should be provided prior to performing a lumbar puncture (e.g. platelet >50,000/mm
3). Lumbar punctures 
will only be performed when felt to be clinically safe by investigator. 
11.10 Laboratory
The below samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SOA.  Additional samples (eg, blood, urine, CSF, tissue, etc) may be collected as needed for further safety testing.
Local lab analysis:  
Sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), total CO
2 (bicarbonate), creatinine, glucose, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or urea (if BUN test cannot be analyzed by the local lab), 
albumin, calcium total, magnesium total (Mg), inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, ALT/GPT, AST/GOT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, LDH, uric acid
C-reactive protein (CRP) 
Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential 
A urine or serum sample will be collected and assessed locally for females of childbearing potential.  If the screening pregnancy test is positive, the subjects should not be enrolled.  If a standard of care pregnancy test is collected during the course of the study, and the result is positive, the investigator should contact the Kite Pharma medical monitor for instructions.  If a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of the study, it must be reported by contacting Kite Pharma Medical Monitor for instructions.

mutations), RNA, or protein markers. In the event that a fresh biopsy is not possible, or would significantly delay treatment, archival tissue is acceptable. If no archival tissue is available and it is not clinically safe to get a fresh biopsy, biopsy will be deferred. 
CSF and possibly bone marrow samples will also be collected and analyzed at the central laboratory as outlined in the schedule of assessments and per Section 10.
See central laboratory manual for details on sample collection, processing, and shipping instructions. 
11.11 Biomarkers and Correlative Analyses
Laboratory Correlative analysis will be performed on blood and tumor samples to evaluate predictive and pharmacodynamic markers for axicabtagene ciloleucel and described in Section 
10.2 
11.12 Description of Study Periods
11.12.1  Screening
The screening period begins on the date the subject signs the IRB/IEC approved ICF and continues through confirmation of enrollment.  Informed consent must be obtained before completion of any non-standard of care study specific procedures.  Procedures that are part of standard of care are not considered study specific procedures and may be performed prior to obtaining consent and used to confirm eligibility.  Confirmation of this data must occur within the time allowance as outlined below and in the SOA.

49After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened to confirm study 
eligibility and participation.  Only subjects who meet the eligibility criteria listed in Section 3 and 
who commence leukapheresis will be enrolled in the study.  If at any time prior to enrollment the subject fails to meet the eligibility criteria, the subject should be designated as a screen failure on the subject screening log with the reasons for failing screening.
The following assessments/procedures are to be completed during the screening period at the time 
points outlined in the SOA:
Medical history and disease assessment
Physical examination including height and weight
oSubjects with symptoms of central nervous system malignancy such as new onset 
severe headaches, neck stiffness, or any focal neurologic findings on physical exam will have lumbar puncture for examination of cerebral spinal fluid.
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature
ECOG performance status 
Neurocognitive function post infusion per standard IPCG guidelines.
ECG
ECHO/MUGA for LVEF and pericardial effusion assessment
oAn ECHO/MUGA performed following the subjects last chemotherapy treatment and within 28 days prior to signing the consent may be used for confirmation of eligibility
Imaging Studies
oBrain MRI 
oBaseline PET CT of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis
PET-CT performed following the subjects last line of therapy and prior to signing the consent may be used for confirmation of eligibility. 
 If PET CT is performed > 28 days prior to the initiation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy or if subject receives any anti-cancer therapy between screening and lymphodepleting chemotherapy, the scans must be repeated to establish a new baseline.  PET CT should be performed as close to enrollment as possible. 
Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy as needed (if not done at initial diagnosis or between diagnosis and screening)
Labs 
oChemistry panel
oCBC with differential
oβ-HCG pregnancy test (serum or urine) on all women of child-bearing potential
Serious Adverse Event reporting (refer to Section 8 for safety reporting guidelines)
Concomitant medications documentation and previous cancer treatment history
Once eligibility confirmed, collection of archived or fresh tumor sample, as well as CSF samples. 
Lumbar puncture for collection of CSF samples to be performed after eligibility confirmed and prior to start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy

5011.12.2  Rescreening
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet the eligibility criteria during the 28-day screening 
period will be permitted to rescreen one time.  Subjects will retain the same subject 
identification number assigned at the original screening.  If rescreening occurs within 28 
days of the signing of the original informed consent, only the procedure(s)/assessment(s) that did not originally meet the eligibility criteria needs to be repeated; all other initial screening procedures/assessments do not need to be repeated.  If rescreening occurs, or leukapheresis is delayed, more than 28 days from the signing of the original informed consent, subjects must be reconsented and repeat all screening procedures/assessments.
11.12.3  Enrollment/Leukapheresis
Before leukapheresis commences, the following criteria must be met.  If criteria are not met, 
leukapheresis must be delayed until the event resolves.   
No evidence or suspicion of an infection
Corticosteroid therapy at a pharmacologic dose (≥5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent 
doses of other corticosteroids) and other immunosuppressive drugs must be avoided for 7 days prior to leukapheresis. 
Once a subject commences leukapheresis, the subject will be considered enrolled into the study.  
The following procedures/requirements will occur within 24hrs of leukapheresis collection day 
and as outlined in the SOA:
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature
Weight

5111.12.4  Bridging Therapy 
If prescribed, bridging therapy must be administered after enrollment and completed prior to 
initiating lymphodepleting chemotherapy per the specifications outlined in Section 6 for bridging 
therapy.
11.12.5  Lymphodepleting  Chemotherapy Period 
If PET-CT will be older than 28 days at the initiation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy or if the 
subject receives any anti-cancer therapy with therapeutic intent (eg, radiation, supraphysiologic doses of steroids, chemotherapy) between the last PET-CT and initiation of lymphodepleting  chemotherapy, the PET-CT must be repeated to establish a new baseline.
Before lymphodepleting chemotherapy commences, the following criteria must be met.  If these 
criteria are not met, then lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be delayed until these events resolve.
No evidence or suspicion of infection 
No clinically evident changes in bone marrow, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac 
function since date of informed consent
No acute neurologic toxicity > Grade 1 (with the exception of peripheral neuropathy)
In addition, if any of the following are known to occur, a delay in lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
may be required.  Contact the Kite Pharma medical monitor before lymphodepleting chemotherapy commences for guidance.
Temperature is ≥ 38.0ºC within 48 hours prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy.  
Unexplained fever requires pan-culture, respiratory viral panel, chest computed tomography (CT), and any additional symptom-directed workup to rule out occult infection. 
The following procedures will be completed during Day –5 to Day –3 at the time points outlined 
in the SOA:
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature
Labs (to be drawn prior to chemotherapy)
oChemistry Panel 
oCBC with differential

5211.12.6  Treatment Period
Corticosteroid therapy at a pharmacologic dose (≥ 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent doses of 
other corticosteroids) and other immunosuppressive drugs must be avoided for 5 days prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel administration. 
Before axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion commences, the following criteria must be met.  If these 
criteria are not met, then axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion must be delayed until these events resolve.  
• No evidence or suspicion of infection.  Subject must not be receiving systemic anti-
microbials for the treatment of an active infection within 48 hours prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (prophylactic use of anti-microbials is allowed).
• No clinically evident changes in bone marrow, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac 
function since screening
• Serum creatinine < 2 x ULN
• No acute neurologic toxicity > Grade 1 (with the exception of peripheral neuropathy)
In addition, if any of the following are known to occur, a delay in axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion 
may be required.  Contact the Kite medical monitor before axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion commences for guidance.
Temperature is ≥ 38.0ºC within 48 hours prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Unexplained fever requires pan-culture, respiratory panel, chest X-ray, and any additional symptom-directed workup to rule out occult infection.
If any screening assessments or procedures are repeated between leukapheresis and the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and results are outside the eligibility criteria (Section 3; with the exception of lymphodepleting chemotherapy-induced cytopenias)
Should an event not meet these criteria immediately prior to receiving axicabtagene ciloleucel, the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion must be delayed until the event resolves.  If the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion is delayed > 2 weeks, lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be repeated.  
All subjects will receive axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion at a healthcare facility followed by daily 
monitoring at a healthcare facility for at least 7 days to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities.  Alternatively, subjects may be hospitalized to receive their axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and be observed for CRS and neurologic toxicities in the hospital setting, if deemed appropriate by the investigator.

Protocol Version Date: 26AUG2021
53If subjects are hospitalized, subjects should not be discharged from the hospital until all 
axicabtagene ciloleucel related non-hematological toxicities return to ≤ Grade 1 or return to baseline.  Subjects may be discharged with non-critical and clinically stable or improving toxicities (eg, renal insufficiency) even if > Grade 1, if deemed appropriate by the investigator.  Subjects should remain in a hospital for ongoing axicabtagene ciloleucel-related fever, hypotension, hypoxia, or ongoing central neurologic toxicities > Grade 1, or if deemed necessary by the investigator.
Subjects should be instructed to remain within proximity of the clinical study site for at least 
4 weeks following axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Subjects and their family members/caregivers should be educated on potential CRS and neurologic symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, confusion, aphasia, dysphagia, somnolence, encephalopathy, ataxia, or tremor.  Subjects or their family members/caregivers should be instructed to immediately contact the treating investigator or seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms develop.
During this period, the following procedures will be completed at the time points outlined in the 
SOA:
Neurological assessment for subjects to include ICANS consensus criteria (ICE 
scores). 
Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature, daily at a health care facility for at least 7 days 
Labs (before axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, as described in the SOA)
oChemistry Panel 
oCBC with differential
oLymphocyte subsets 
oCytokine levels 
oAnti-CD19 CAR T cells
oRCR analysis
Infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel
Administration of weight based anakinra (<50kg = 100mg, ≥50kg =200mg) as detailed in 
section 6.4.3. 
Lumbar puncture as described in the SOA when clinically appropriate.  
Concomitant medications documentation
Monitoring of CRP, ferritin, and LDH (only if LDH is elevated at baseline) levels may assist with 
the diagnosis and define the clinical course in regard to CRS/neurologic toxicities.  It is, therefore, recommended that CRP, ferritin, and LDH (if elevated at baseline) be monitored daily starting at Day 0 and for at least 7 days at a healthcare facility. In addition, lactate should be monitored as clinically indicated.   
11.12.7 Post-treatment Assessment Period
After completing axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and completing the minimum 7-day 
observation period , all subjects will be followed in the post-treatment assessment period.

55Cytokines 
At any time during the post treatment assessment period, if a subject progresses and is either not 
eligible for re-treatment or chooses not to pursue re-treatment, the subject will proceed directly to the Month 3 visit and be followed for survival, subsequent therapy and disease outcomes in the long term follow-up period.  A PMBC (for anti-CD19 CAR T cells) and serum sample  (for 
cytokine evaluation) should be collected at the time of progression, prior to starting any subsequent anti-cancer therapy.
11.12.8 Long-term Follow-up Period
All enrolled subjects will be followed in the long-term follow-up period for survival and disease 
status, if applicable.  Subjects will begin the long-term follow-up period after they have completed the Month 3 visit of the post treatment assessment period (whether they have responded to treatment or went straight to the Month 3 visit due to disease progression) 
Every 3 months (± 2 weeks) through Month 18
Every 6 months (± 1 month) between Month 24 
The following procedures will be completed for subjects who are enrolled and receive axicabtagene ciloleucel  at the time points outlined in the SOA:
Physical exam
PET-CT/ Disease assessment through 24 months or until disease progression, whichever 
occurs first. If subject’s disease has not progressed by Month 24, disease assessments will continue to be performed per institutional standard of care. 
Survival status

56If a subject progress in the LTFU phase, the subject will continue to be followed for survival status 
and subsequent therapy for the treatment of NHL.  A PMBC sample (for anti-CD19 CAR T cells) and serum (for cytokine evaluation) should be collected at the time of progression, prior to starting any subsequent anti-cancer therapy.
The following procedures/assessments will be completed for subjects who are enrolled, but do not 
receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or anakinra, at the time points outlined in the SOA:
Subsequent therapy for the treatment of NHL
Survival status
Disease assessment per standard of care
Adverse/Serious Adverse Event reporting and concomitant medication documentation 
until 30 days after last procedure (e.g., leukapheresis, lymphodepleting  chemotherapy). 
Should the subject fail to return to the clinic for a scheduled protocol specific visit, sites will need 
to make 2 attempts by a combination of telephone and mail to contact the subject. Sites must document both attempts to contact the subject.  If a subject does not respond within 1 month after the second contact the subject will be considered lost to follow-up and no additional contact will be required. 
All subjects will be consented to the CIBMTR immune effector cell therapy registry at the same 
time as consent for this protocol and data will be reported on standard schedules immediately following infusion as required by FDA. Following Month 24 patients, protocol long-term followup will continue through the  CIBMTR immune effector cell therapy registry as part of the FDA mandated 15-year follow-up period.
11.12.9 Retreatment 
Subjects may have an option to receive a second course of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and 
axicabtagene ciloleucel without administration of anakinra prophylaxis under the following 
conditions:
Subject had no better than a PR 
Subjects disease subsequently progresses
CD19 tumor expression confirmed locally by biopsy after disease progression and prior to re-
treatment.  A portion of the biopsy should be sent to the central laboratory. 
Subject continues to meet the original study eligibility criteria with exception of prioraxicabtagene ciloleucel use in this study.  Screening assessments should be repeated if clinically indicated, as determined by the investigator, to confirm eligibility.
Subject has not received subsequent therapy for the treatment of lymphoma
Toxicities related to lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide), with the exception of alopecia, have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or returned to baseline prior to re-treatment
There is a second infusion available from the patient’s original manufacturing.

57The decision to administer re-treatment should be made in consultation with the Sponsor.  In 
addition, a discussion regarding benefits and risks of retreatment and including the potential need to undergo leukapheresis a second time for the manufacturing of axicabtagene ciloleucel should occur with the subject prior to performing any study related procedures or treatment.  This conversation should also be recorded in the subject’s source document.  
A maximum of 1 retreatment course may occur per subject.  Subjects who are retreated will follow 
the same treatment schedule and procedural requirements per the initial treatment. 
Allowance for retreatment is based on clinical experience reported in the 2 studies conducted at 
the pediatric 
49 and Surgery Branch 50 of the NCI where 6 subjects in total have been re-treated 
upon progression.  Three of the re-treated subjects (indolent lymphoma/leukemia) experienced durable responses to retreatment after an initial response and disease progression. Given limited experience with re-treatment, re-infusions will be censored from the primary end-point and efficacy outcomes will be analyzed separately.

1  Archival/Fresh tumor sample: Either FFPE tumor block or up to 20 unstained slides. Either archived or  a fresh tumor samples (either will suffice) will be submitted to central laboratory after eligibility 
has been confirmed and prior to start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. See central laboratory manual for details
2 PET-CT (Neck-Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis)/disease assessment: If PET-CT performed > 28 days prior to the initiation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy or if subject receives any anti-cancer therapy 
between screening and lymphodepleting  chemotherapy, baseline scans must be repeated. Screening PET-CT should be completed as close to enrollment as possible.  As applicable, bone marrow 
aspirate/biopsy will be performed to confirm response (i.e., for subjects presenting with bone marrow involvement prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with lymphoma after treatment).  Bone marrow samples may also be collected and analyzed centrally for subjects who develop toxicities post axicabtagene ciloleucel.  
3 Blood draw for Anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel  antibodies:  Baseline antibody sample to be collected prior to start of leukapheresis. Anti-axi-cel antibodies will be examined at baseline, days 28 and 90 
after the first administration of the drug and 4 weeks post study. If any anti-drug antibodies are detected in patients, monitoring should continue until patient antibody levels return to the baseline. 
4  Blood draw for RCR:  on Day 0 prior to administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel and at Month 3, 6 and 12; then collect yearly for up to 15 years. Yearly samples will only be analyzed  if positive at 
Month 3, 6, or 12.
5  Cytokines: prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion on Day 0, then on Day 1 and then every other day during the 7 day post infusion monitoring period.
6  Lumbar Puncture:  subjects with symptoms of CNS malignancy (e.g., new onset severe headaches, neck stiffness, or focal neurological findings) will have lumbar puncture performed at screening to 
assess cerebral spinal fluid for possible CNS involvement.  Subjects will have lumbar puncture for the collection of CSF performed at baseline prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (if not already performed as part of screening and within 28 days of axicabtagene infusion), post axicabtagene ciloleucel  infusion (Day 5 ± 3 days) and at week 4 visit (±3 days).  
7 If a subject is admitted to the hospital within the 7-day observation period is discharged and then subsequently re-admitted to the hospital with any axicabtagene ciloleucel related adverse events, 
blood samples for anti-CD19 CAR T cells and cytokines will be collected on day of hospital re-admission and then weekly through and including the  day of discharge. Blood samples for anti-CD19 
CAR T cells and cytokines should also be collected at the time of disease progression prior to starting any subsequent anticancer therapy.
8 Anakinra, weight-based dosing (100mg for subjects <50kg, 200mg for subjects ≥ 50kg). Anakinra will be given subQ for prophylactic dosing on days 0 through day +13 per section 6.4.3. The first dose 
of anakinra should be given 4 hours (+/- 30 min) prior to planned axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
9  Levetiracetam at a dose of 750mg (PO or IV) twice daily starting day of infusion (Day 0) See Sections 5.1 and 7 for further details.
10Cytokines: prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion on Day 0, then on Day 1, and then every other day during the 7 day post infusion monitoring period.
11 In the event of hospitalization, ICANS neurotoxicity assessments (including ICE scores) will be obtained daily until discharge. 
12 Specific grading based on CTCAE 4.03 can be found in appendix A “Grading and Management of Neurologic Toxicities” for grading of nervous system disorders involving somnolence, confusion, 
memory impairment,  encephalopathy, dysphagia, seizures, and cerebral edema.
13For weekend/holiday sample collections following axicabtagene infusion, allow for +/- 24hr window.
14 While PET-CT is preferred, CT assessment may be used in place of PET-CT in the event of failure to obtain insurance coverage. Baseline, month 1, 6 and 12 should be assessed via PET/CT.

Page 6112. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT
12.1 Neurotox Response Assessment
Neurotox will be graded using CTCAE 4.03 as was done for Zuma-1 which will act as a historical 
control. Specific grading based on CTCAE 4.03 can be found in appendix A “Grading and Management of Neurologic Toxicities” for grading of nervous system disorders involving somnolence, confusion, memory impairment,  encephalopathy, dysphagia, seizures, and cerebral edema. Additionally, information required for Neurotox grading per ASTCT consensus criteria will also be collected as an exploratory endpoint. Specific ICANS related ASTCT grading requirements, including ICE scores, can be found in appendix A “ASBMT Grading of ICANS.”
12.2 Disease Response Assessment
Subjects will be evaluated for disease response by the site investigator at times indicated in the SOA.  Disease assessments will be evaluated per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
1.  Flow cytometric, molecular or cytogenetic studies will not be used to determine 
response.
Baseline PET-CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, along with the appropriate imaging 
of all other sites of disease are required.  Subjects will undergo additional PET-CT or CT tumor 
assessments after their axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  While PET-CT is preferred, CT assessment may be used in place of PET-CT in the event of failure to obtain insurance coverage. Baseline, month 1, 6 and 12 should be assessed via PET/CT. The first of these post-treatment PET-CT tumor assessments will occur 4 weeks after infusion; subsequent assessments will occur at regular intervals throughout the post-treatment and long-term follow-up portions of the study, as highlighted in the SOA.
After axicabtagene ciloleucel and anakinra administration, disease assessments will be used to 
determine the time when progressive disease occurs.  Subjects with symptoms suggestive of disease progression should be evaluated for progression at the time symptoms occur even if it is off schedule as per the SOA. 
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed in subjects who are being assessed for CR.  
Per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
1, a bone marrow aspirate and 
biopsy should be performed only when the subject had bone marrow involvement with lymphoma prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with lymphoma after treatment.  The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must show no evidence of disease by morphology, or if indeterminate by morphology, it must be negative by immunohistochemistry to assign a CR to treatment.  
For subjects who discontinue the study due to an assessment of progressive disease which was not 
subsequently confirmed by a central radiology reviewer, any additional imaging data, subsequent to the image in question will be submitted to the central reviewer to confirm disease response.

6213. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 8.0 
(Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).
13.1 Data Reporting
13.1.1 Method
The Office of Data Quality (ODQ) will collect, manage, and perform quality checks on the 
data for this study.
13.1.2 Responsibility for Data Submission
Investigative sites within DF/HCC or DF/PCC are responsible for submitting data and/or 
data forms to the Office of Data Quality (ODQ) in accordance with DF/HCC policies.
13.2 Data Safety Monitoring
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity and accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of medical oncologists, research nurses, pharmacists and biostatisticians with direct experience in cancer clinical research.  Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI, study team and Kite/Gilead. The DSMC will review protocols up to, but not more than four times a year with the primary focus being accrual, protocol adherence, audit results and summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow-up. Given the collaborative nature of this protocol, there will be an an additional safety review team (SRT) comprised of the study sponsor/PI and Kite/Gilead meant to review all study safety data and make recommendations on further study conduct as described below.  As both axicabtagene ciloleucel and anakinra are FDA approved therapies with known toxicity profiles, the goal of the SRT will be to observe for unforeseen toxicities not previously observed in the initial phase I/II studies that led to FDA approval of both agents. Specific guidance as outlined in section 8.4.4. 
The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year with the frequency determined by 
the outcome of previous reviews. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up-to-date participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade 2 or higher unexpected adverse events that have been reported; summary of all deaths occurring within 30 days of intervention for Phase I or II protocols; for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow-up; any response information; audit results, and a summary provided by the study team. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request.

63The primary objective of the study is to assess the impact of anakinra as preventative management 
of neurotoxicity.  Secondary objectives will include evaluate the impact of anakinra  as preventative management of CAR-T related CRS, to evaluate the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in combination with preventative anakinra in terms of DOR, ORR, PFS, and OS in comparison to the pivotal Zuma-1 study.
14.1 Study Endpoints
Primary Endpoint:
Rate and severity of neurotoxicity as per CTCAE v4.03 criteria within the first 30 days of 
infusion. 
Secondary Endpoints:
Rate and severity of CRS as per Lee 2014 criteria within the first 30 days of infusion in 
comparison to the pivotal Zuma-1 study. 
Duration of response (DOR): Among subjects who experience an objective response, DOR is defined as the date of their first objective response to disease progression per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
1 or death regardless of cause. 
Subjects not meeting the criteria for progression or death by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date and their response will be noted as ongoing.
Objective response rate (ORR): ORR is defined as the incidence of either a complete 
response or a partial response by the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
1.  All subjects that do not meet the criteria for an objective response by the 
analysis data cutoff date will be considered non-responders.  
Progression-free Survival (PFS): PFS is defined as the time from the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion date to the date of disease progression per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
1 or death from any cause.  Subjects not meeting the 
criteria for progression by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date.  
Overall survival (OS):  OS is defined as the time from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion 
to the date of death.  Subjects who have not died by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last contact date.
Exploratory Endpoints:
Levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood
Levels of cytokines in serum and CSF
Incidence of anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies
Investigation of potential biomarker development based on assessment of blood cells, 
tumor cells and the proposed actions of the investigational product.

64Rates of CRS/NT based on grading used in Zuma-1 (i.e. Lee 2014 for CRS, and CTCAE 
version 4.03 for neurotoxicity) vs ASTCT consensus guidelines 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens or earlier 
interventions on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities.  The assessment of ORR is a secondary objective, and the analysis will be descriptive. 
14.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration
The anticipated enrollment in this study is approximately 20 patients over a 2-year period. The 
goal is to accrue one patient/month to the study protocol over this period. 
With 20 patients the study will have 86% power to detect a decrease in the neurotoxicity rate from 
45% to 15% via a two-sided exact binomial test with a significance level of 0.05.  The secondary objectives of this study include analyses the rate and severity of CRS as well as efficacy endpoints (ORR, DOR, PFS, OS) and levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells and cytokines in the blood.
All subjects will be followed for survival for up to approximately 15 years after the last subject 
receives axicabtagene ciloleucel per FDA requirements and data will be collected through the 
CIBMTR data registry starting at Month 24. 
14.3 Interim Monitoring Plan
Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Rules
The SRT will review safety data when 8 subjects treated have had the opportunity to be followed 
for 30 days, respectively.  
The rate of grade 2+ neurotoxicity will be evaluated using a Simon’s two-stage design. Initially, 8 
patients will be enrolled. If 3 or more of the initial 8 patients experience grade 2+ neurotoxicity, enrollment will be terminated early or dosing modification discussed. The probability of early termination is 0.78 if the true rate of grade 2+ neurotoxicity is 45% or higher. Otherwise, enrollment will continue to a total of 20 patients. The treatment will be considered promising if 5 or fewer of 20 patients experience grade 2+ neurotoxicity. The two-stage design provides 86% power to demonstrate that the treatment is associated with a favorable neurotoxicity rate if the true rate is 15%. In contrast, there is a 4% (alpha) probability of concluding that the treatment has a favorable neurotoxicity rate if the true rate is 45% or higher.
Safety Interim Analysis
The SRT will review AE and SAE information on a regular basis throughout subject treatment in 
Phase 2 of the study.  AE and SAE information will be collected to assure no unforeseen toxicities are noted with this combination. The SRT may request additional safety data or modify the study conduct.  The sponsor may request additional reviews by the SRT if safety concerns are identified.

Additional stopping rules per section 8.4.4.   
Efficacy Interim Analysis
There is no planned efficacy interim analysis for this portion of the study. 
14.4 Analysis of Primary and Secondary Endpoints
Planned Method of Analysis
The primary analysis of all treated subjects have had the opportunity to be followed for 8 weeks and 6 months for primary and secondary endpoints respectively.  No central radiologic review of disease assessment will be performed for these cohorts.
Descriptive analyses may occur at any time.Neurotoxicity Rate
The incidence of grade 2+ neurotoxicity will be assessed in comparison to a historical rate of 45% via a two-sided exact binomial test with significant level of 0.05. Exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for the neurotoxicity rate will be generated.
Objective Response Rate
The incidence of objective response and exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated.  
Duration of ResponseThe 
Kaplan-Meier survival method  will be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse.  
The cumulative incidence of relapse in the presence of non-disease related mortality (Kaplan-
Meier method) will be estimated along with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals at 3-month intervals.  Progression-free SurvivalKaplan-Meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated for progression-free survival time.  Estimates of the proportion of subjects alive and progression-free at 3-month intervals will be provided.
Overall SurvivalKaplan-Meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated for OS.  Estimates 
of the proportion of subjects alive at 3-month intervals will be provided.
Safety
Subject incidence rates of adverse events including all, serious, fatal, CTCAE version 4.03 Grade 3 or higher and treatment related AEs reported throughout the conduct of the study will be tabulated by preferred term and system organ class.  Changes in laboratory values and vital signs will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  The incidence of concomitant medications will be summarized.
Tables and/or narratives of deaths though the long-term follow-up and treatment related SAEs will 
be provided.

66In the event of changes in the safety management using steroids, sensitivity analyses will explore 
the effect of these changes on outcomes via stratification and/or adjustment for use of steroids in multivariable models.
14.5 Reporting and Exclusions
The statistical reporting of the safety and efficacy endpoints will be compared to historical controls from the Zuma-1 study. Subject incidence rates of treatment-emergent CRS, neurologic toxicities, axicabtagene ciloleucel-related adverse events, and ORRs will be summarized. DOR, PFS, and OS will also be summarized. 
Analysis Subsets  
Full Analysis Set: the full analysis set will consist of all enrolled subjects and will be used for 
summaries of subject disposition.
Modified Intent to Treat Set (mITT): the modified intent to treat set will consist of all subjects 
enrolled and treated with the target dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel, 2 x 10
6 CAR T cells/kg (range 
1 x 106 to 2.4 x 106 CAR T cells/kg) and at least one dose of anakinra. This analysis set will be 
used for all efficacy analyses.
Safety Analysis Subset: The safety analysis subset is defined as all subjects treated with any dose 
of axicabtagene ciloleucel and at least one dose of anakinra. For retreated subjects, only the initial treatment will contribute to the safety analyses while events following retreatment will not be included in the safety analysis. 
Retreatment Subset: Separate safety and efficacy analyses will be conducted in subjects who are 
retreated. These analyses will include data from non-initial treatments and follow the inclusion criteria specified above for safety and efficacy analysis.  
Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments
This is a single arm, open-label study and subjects and investigators will be aware of treatment received.  Data handling procedures for the the study will be devised to reduce potential sources of bias and maintain the validity and credibility of the study.  These procedures will be outlined in the study statistical analysis plan and Trial Integrity Document.

78APPENDIX B
Revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007)
Complete Remission (CR):  CR requires all of the following: 
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-
related symptoms if present before therapy. 
Typically FDG-avid lymphoma (large cell, mantle cell and follicular lymphomas are all typically FDG-avid):  in subjects with no pretreatment PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.  
Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown:  in subjects without a pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in greatest diameter if > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and more than 1 cm in their short axis before treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.  
The spleen and/or liver, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on basis of physical exam or CT scan, must should be normal size on CT scan and not be palpable on physical examination and nodules thought to represent lymphoma must no longer be present.  
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is performed only when the patient had bone marrow involvement with lymphoma prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with lymphoma after treatment.  The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must show no evidence of disease by morphology or if indeterminate by morphology it must be negative by immunohistochemistry.  The biopsy core sample must be a minimum of 20 mm in length. 
Partial Remission (PR): PR requires all of the following:
≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.  Dominant nodes or nodal masses should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions, should be from different regions of the body if possible and should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal nodes if possible.  
No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease.  
If multiple splenic and hepatic nodules are present, they must regress by ≥ 50% in the SPD.  There must be a > 50% decrease in the greatest transverse diameter for single nodules.   
Bone marrow is irrelevant for determination of a PR.  If patient has persistent bone marrow involvement and otherwise meets criteria for CR the patient will be considered a PR.
Typically FDG-avid lymphoma:  for subjects with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET scan should be positive in at least one previously involved site.  Note: in subjects with follicular lymphoma or mantle-cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated in subjects with one or at most two residual masses that have regressed by 50% on CT scan.

79Stable Disease (SD): 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD.  PET should be positive in typically FDG-avid lymphomas.
Progressive Disease: Defined by at least one of the following:  
≥ 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes, or if a single node is involved at least a 50% increase in the product of the diameters of this one node.  
Appearance of a new lesion greater than 1.5 cm in any axis even if other lesions are decreasing in size
Greater than or equal to a 50% increase in size of splenic or hepatic nodules 
At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis. 
Lesions should be PET positive in typically FDG-avid lymphomas unless the lesion is too small to be detected by PET (<1.5 cm in its long axis by CT)

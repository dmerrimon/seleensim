CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Protocol Synopsis  
 
Title A Phase 2, Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, 
Parallel-group, Study to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability of 
Multiple Dose Administration of CSL112 in Subjects with Moderate 
Renal Impairment and Acute Myocardial Infarction    
Study Number CSL112_2001  
Sponsor CSL Behring LLC  (CSLB) 
Development Phase  2 
Study Product CSL112 (Reconstituted High Density Lipoprotein)  
Indication  Reduction of early recurrent atherothrombotic events in acute myocardial 
infarction patients (ST segment elevation myocardial i nfarction [STEMI] 
or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]) who are 
at high risk of subsequent events.  
Study Summary  CSL112 drug product resembles nascent high density lipoprotein (HDL). It is a novel formulation of apolipoprotein A- I (apoA-I), 
phosphatidylcholine (PC), and cholate; and is stabilized by sucrose. 
CSL112 is being developed for the reduction of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The premise of the 
CSL112 mechanism of action and the resulting treatment strategy is that 
infusion of apoA -I after the index ACS event, and during the subacute 
period after the event, will reduce the size and/or instability of 
atherosclerotic plaque, thereby reducing the risk of plaque rupture or 
erosion that would lead to a recurrent CV event in patients with AMI .  
Renal impairment (RI) is a prevalent and increasingly common 
concurrent condition in patients with AMI . Patients who experience an 
AMI event are at high risk for a recurrent CV event and mortality is 
inversely related to renal function status: subjects wit h mild, moderate, 
and severe RI have, respectively, progressively poorer long -term 
prognosis as compared with patients with normal renal function. As the number of AMI  patients with RI is relatively high (~15 % to 30%) 
(Gibson et al, 2004; Fox et al, 2010), the identification of therapies that 
are safe and effective in these patients would represent an important 
advancement in medical therapy.  
This study is a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to investigate the safety and tolerability of up to 4 weekly intravenous (IV) administrations of 
CSL112 compared with placebo in subjects with moderate RI ( estimated 
glomerular fitration rate [ eGFR] ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m
2) and 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  CSL112 drug product contains sucrose as a stabilizer. Administration of 
sucrose by IV infusion has been associated with reports of acute kidney 
injury (AKI) attributed to osmotic nephrosis when immune globulin 
intravenous (IGIV) products formulated with sucrose were administered 
at high doses or high rates of administration  (Epstein and Zoon, 2000 ). 
Thus, evaluation of the renal safety of CSL112 is warranted, specifically in the subpopulation of patients with moderate RI who have experienced 
a recent AMI event. No renal safety concerns were identified in the 4 
completed CSL112 phase 1 and 2a studies, including a phase 1 
multicenter center, double -blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single-
dose phase 1 study in adult subjects with moderate RI (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m
2) and in healthy adult subjects with normal renal 
function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) (Study CSL112_1001). In 
addition, a phase 2b study (Study CSLCT- HDL-12-77), a multicenter, 
randomized, placebo- controlled study to investigate the hepatic and renal 
safety and tolerability of multiple dose administration of 2 IV infusion 
regimens of CSL1 12 versus placebo in approximately 1200 subjects with 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was initiated in the third quarter of 
2014 and completed in the first quarter of 2016. To date, the program 
level Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB) has reviewed safety 
and pharmacokinetic ( PK) data from the Active Treatment Period after 
5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% of subjects were enrolled, and recommended the study continue without change. Data are not yet 
available for this study. Further evaluation of the safety and tolerability 
of multiple dose administration of CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI 
and AMI are warranted before inclusion of this population in a phase 3 
morbidity and mortality outcomes trial. 
This phase 2 study is intended to characterize the renal risk profile of 
CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI who have experienced a recent 
AMI. The occurrence of clinically important renal serious adverse events 
(SAEs) as reported by the Investigator  and AKI will be evaluated.  In 
subjects with moderate RI who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the occurrence of AKI as defined by the Acute 
Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria is approximately 10% ( Tsai et al, 
2014
). After excluding subjects with evidence of AKI  at screening , the 
occurrence of renal SAEs and AKI will be assessed in this post- AMI 
moderate RI patient population.    
Primary Objective(s)  To assess the renal safety of CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI and 
AMI after  administration of  up to 4 weekly infusions of CSL112.  
Primary Endpoint(s)  Co-primary endpoints of the incidences of treatment- emergent: 
1. Renal SAEs, defined in Section 2.1.2  
2. AKI, defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol /L) during the Active Treatment 
Period that is sustained upon repeat measurement by the centra l

repeat value is obtained, a single serum creatinine value that is 
increased from baseline ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) during the Active 
Treatment Period would also fulfil the definition of AKI.  
Treatment -emergent is defined as occurring at or after the start of the first 
infusion. Baseline for determination of AKI is defined as the pre-infusion 
central laboratory serum creatinine level on Study Day 1. 
Secondary Objective(s)  Secondary objectives of the study are:  
1. To further characterize the safety and tolerability of CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI and AMI.    
2. To characterize the PK of CSL112 after multiple dose administration in subjects with moderate RI and AMI. 
Secondary Endpoint(s)  Secondary safety and tolerability endpoints include:  
1. The occurrence of any treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
throughout the study 
2. Occurrence of treatment- emergent adverse drug reactions or 
suspected adverse drug reactions defined as:  
a. All TEAEs, inc luding local tolerability events, that begin 
during or within 1 hour after the end of an infusion, or  
b. Those TEAEs which the Investigator  or Sponsor indicates 
may be causally related to the administration of the 
investigational product (CSL112 or placebo), or  
c. All TEAEs for which the Investigator's causality assessment is 
missing or indeterminate, or  
d. All TEAEs for which the incidence in an active treatment arm exceeds the exposure-adjusted incidence rate in the placebo arm by 30% or more, provided the difference in incidence 
rates is 1% or more.  
3. Changes from baseline ( ie, pre-infusion on Study Day 1)  through to 
the end of the Active Treatment Period  in renal status de
fined as: 
a. Absolute increases from baseline in serum creatinine as 
follows: 
i. ≤ baseline value  
ii. > 0 to < 0.3 mg/dL 
iii. ≥0.3 to ≤0.5 mg/dL 
iv. > 0.5 mg/dL 
b. Increases in serum creatinine that are sustained for

d. Serum total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN (Note: For subjects with a 
history of Gilbert’s syndrome, this assessment will be based 
on indirect bilirubin.) 
e. Serum total bilirubin > 2 x ULN (Note: For subjects with a history of Gilbert’s syndrome, this assessment will be based 
on indirect bilirubin.) 
f. Possible Hy's Law cases, as defined in the FDA Guidance for 
Industry: Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation ( July 2009 ; see Section 9.1.3.3 for definition of 
Hy’s Law ) 
5. The occurrence of treatment -emergent bleeding events as defined by 
the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) criteria

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Number of Subjects  Approximately 81 subjects will be enrolled into this study .  
Study Duration  The maximum duration of the study for an individual subject is expected 
to be approximately 9 weeks. This estimation is based on:  
• a 5-day Screening Period  
• a 4-week Active Treatment Period  
• a 4-week Safety Follow -up Period  
The overall study duration ( ie, first subject’s screening visit to last 
subject’s end of study visit) is estimated to be approximately 9 months. 
Study Population and 
Main Criteria for 
Eligibility  
 Men or women at least 18 years of age with moderate RI (eGFR ≥ 30 and 
< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, as calculated by the CKD-EPI equation). Subjects 
must also have evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting 
consistent with a type I (spontaneous) AMI as defined by the following: 
• Detection of a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin I or T with at least 
1 value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit.  
AND, 
• Any 1 or more of the following:  
− Symptoms of ischemia 
− New (or presumably new) significant ST/T wave changes or left 
bundle-branch block (LBBB) 
− Development of pathological Q waves on ECG 
− Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality  
− Identification of intracoronary thrombus by angiography 
Before the first infusion of investigational product, the subject  must be 
clinically stable, have hepatic function tests within acceptable limits, and 
have documented evidence of stable renal function and no suspicion of 
AKI at least 12 hours after FMC for the index AMI. For subjects 
undergoing angiography, with or without PCI, stable renal function is 
defined as a serum creatinine value at least 12 hours after IV contrast 
administration that is increased < 0.3 mg/dL from the pre-contrast 
administration value.  
If the local laboratory post- contrast serum creatinine value is increased  
> 0.3 mg/dL from the pre-contrast administration value, the laboratory 
test may be repeated once at least 24 hours after the initial assessment to 
determine eligibility and stable renal function. The repeat serum 
creatinine value must be increased  < 0.3 mg/dL from the pre-contrast 
administration value and there must be no clinical suspicion of AKI for 
the subject to be eligible to receive the first infusion (Table 7).

profile in the broader population. The DSMB may recommend a change 
to the protocol to ameliorate any safety concerns  or provide 
recommendations regarding subsequent dosing and/or study progression/stopping. The DSMB will also be convened to review all available data if 1 or more of the study stopping rules is met (see

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CSL112 
1.1.1 Overview 
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening condition, that most commonly occurs 
when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures or erodes , leading to thrombus formation within a 
coronary artery. A thrombus within a coronary artery can result in unstable angina (UA), a myocardial infarction (MI [ ie, heart attack ]) or sudden death. Even after recovery from an 
acute episode of ACS, patients continue to be at heightened risk. The short- term morbidity 
and mortality associated with both the index coronary event and recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events can be as high as 20% per year (Fox et al, 2006), and are inversely related to 
renal function status, such that subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (RI) have progressively poorer long -term prognosis as compared with patients with normal 
renal function  (Gibson et al, 2004; Fox et al, 2010). In patients with ACS and RI, the 
prognosis, both short- and long-term, is worse than for those with normal renal function, as 
the risk of CV events and mortali ty is inversely proportional to the estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR [ Nabais et al, 2008; Bhandari and Jain, 2012]). Therefore, the 
identification of therapies that are safe and effective in patients with concurrent  RI and ACS 
would represent an important advancement in medical therapy. 
Renal impairment is a prevalent and growing concurrent condition in ACS and acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI). Among 13,307 patients who participated in the Non- ST-
Segment Elevation A cute Coronary Syndrome Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 
(NSTE-ACS TIMI) trials, 37.2% of patients had normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 
mL/min/1.73 m
2), 47.1% of patients had mildly impaired GFR (GFR ≥ 60 to < 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2), and 15.1% of patients had moderately impaired GFR (GFR ≥ 30 to <60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 [Gibson et al, 2004]). In a more recent analysis of 49,491 AMI patients from 
the US-based National Cardiovascular Data Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention 
Outcomes Network (ACTION) Registry, which collects data from 280 hospitals for all

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  patients with a primary diagnosis of MI (either non -ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction [NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) who 
presented within 24 hours of the onset of an ischemic syndrome, approximately 30.5% of 
patients had Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD, ie , moderate RI [ Fox et al, 2010]). Given 
the growing prevalence of RI in patients with AMI coupled with the subsequent heightened 
risk of recurrent CV events in this population, identification of therapies that are safe and 
effective in these patients is critical.    
High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol exerts a protective effect in experi mental models 
of atherosclerotic CV disease. The proposed mechanism(s) for the atheroprotective properties 
of HDL are multifaceted ( Remaley et al, 2008; Tardif et al, 2009). High density lipoprotein is 
believed to bring about beneficial effects mainly by reverse cholesterol transport, whereby 
excess cholesterol is removed from arteries containing atherosclerotic plaques back to the liver for excretion. This removal of cholesterol is mediated by the dominant protein of HDL, 
apolipoprotein A- I (apoA-I, Tall, 1998).    
CSL112 is a novel formulation of apoA-I purified from human plasma and reconstituted to form HDL particles. It is being developed for use in patients with AMI  for the reduction in 
risk of recurrent CV events via the action of apoA -I. Apolipoprotein A- I is the active 
component of CSL112 and other components include phosphatidylcholine ( PC), sodium 
cholate, and sucrose. Additional information about the disposition of components of administered CSL112 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for CSL112. 
1.1.2 Nonclinical Evaluation 
CSL112 single and repeat dose nonclinical safety studies have been conducted. After a single 
intravenous (IV) infusion of 1-hour duration, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 
300 mg/kg was established in both the rat and cynomolgus monkey. In the repeat dose studies (CSL112 administered once every 3 days for 4 weeks by 2-hour IV infusion), a NOAEL of 
80 mg/kg was established in the rat; however, a NOAEL was not established in the

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  cynomolgus monkey because some adverse effects were observed at the lowest dose tested 
(80 mg/kg). No treatment- related deaths occurred in any of the toxicity studies.  
After IV administration of CSL112 to both rats and monkeys, the primary toxicological effects were hepatic and hematologic in nature. The effects were generally reversible, 
asymptomatic, and exhibited a moderate dose-response relationship. Some minor effects on 
renal parameters were also observed; however, as there were no correlative histopathology 
findings in the kidney, the toxicological significance is unclear.  
Further details on the hepatic and hematologic effects  in the nonclinical studies , as well as 
other observations with CSL112, can be found in the IB for CSL112. 
1.1.3 Previous C linical Experience  
CSL112 has been evaluated in 2, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1, 
healthy adult, non- Investigational New Drug ( IND) studies conducted in Australia 
(CSLCT-HDL-09-63 – Single Ascending Dose [SAD] study; CSLCT -HDL-10-68 – Multiple 
Ascending Dose [MAD] study) and 1 multicenter center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single-dose phase 1 non- IND study in adult subjects with moderate RI (eGFR ≥ 30 
and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m
2) and in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 
90 mL/min/1.73 m2) (Study CSL112_1001) conducted in Germany and the United Kingdom. 
Study CSL112_1001 was initiated in the second quarter of 2015, enrolment was completed as of 16 November 2015, and last subject last visit occurred on 15 February 2016. This study 
was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic ( PK), safety, and tolerability of CSL112 in 
adult subjects with moderate RI and in age, gender, and weight matched healthy adult subjects with normal ren al function. The primary objective of the study was to assess the 
effect of moderate RI on the PK of CSL112. Subjects were randomized 3:1 active to placebo within a cohort (4 cohorts total: 2 moderate RI and 2 healthy adult subject cohorts at 2 
different d oses, each with 8 subjects). Twenty-four subjects received 1 infusion of CSL112 in 
this study, 12 with normal renal function and 12 with moderate RI. Based on Data and Safety Monitoring ( DSMB) review of PK and safety data from 12 moderate RI subjects recei ving

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  either the CSL112 2 g or 6 g dose, the 6 g dose has been selected for the current study. Data 
from the Active Treatment Period  are available and demonstrate an acceptable safety profile 
of a single dose of CSL112 in adult subjects with moderate RI (Section 1.3). The rationale for the 6 g CSL112 dose based on PK data from this phase 1 study is presented in Section 3.2. 
In addition, a phase 2a IND study (CSLCT -HDL-10-70a) has been conducted in subjects 
diagnosed with stable atherothrombotic disease; in essence, the AMI target population after  
their initial acute presentation. The phase 2a subjects were representative of the target phase 3 
population in age, sex , concurrent medical conditions (eg, diabetes, hypertension) and 
chronic concomitant medications (eg , dual anti- platelet therapy, statins)  and were stratified 
by renal function (ie, normal renal function or mild RI). The goals of the phase 2a study were 
to evaluate the comparability of the PK and safety profile in patients with stable 
atherothrombotic disease as compared to that of h ealthy adults and to evaluate a range of 
doses to be administered in future CSL112 clinical studies in AMI  patients who are at high 
risk of subsequent CV events.  
A total of 126 subjects ( 93 healthy adults , including 12 with moderate RI, and 33 patients) 
have received at least 1 dose of CSL112 in 4 completed studies. The results of the phase 1 
and 2a studies showed acceptable safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of CSL112 
across a range of doses  and renal function groups. 
A phase 2b study (Study CSLCT-HDL-12-77) was initiated in the third  quarter of 2014 and 
completed in the first quarter of 2016. It is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study to investigate the hepatic and renal safety and tolerability of multiple dose 
administration of 2 IV infusion regimens of CSL112 (low [2 g] and high dose [6 g]) versus 
placebo in approximately 1200 subjects with acute myocardial infarction  (AMI). Subjects are 
stratified by renal function (normal renal function [eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m
2] or mild RI 
[eGFR ≥ 60 and < 90 mL/min/1. 73 m2]). The study consisted of a Safety Lead -in Period, 
during which subjects received a single 2-hour infusion of CSL112 (2 g) or placebo , followed 
by the main study, during which subjects rece ive four 2-hour infusions of inves tigational

the 4-week Active Treatment Period . The data from the Safety Lead -in Period were evaluated 
by the program level DSMB on 9 January 2015 and enrolment of subjects into the main study 
began in January 2015. Enrolment in the main study completed as of 15 November 2015 and 
the last subject last visit occurred on 21 March 2016. Based on a randomization ratio 
(CSL112:placebo) of 2:1 and final enrolment of 1258 randomized subjects, approximately 
839 subjects will have received at least 1 infusion of CSL112 in the phase 2b  study. To date, 
the program level DSMB has reviewed safety and PK data from the Active Treatment Period  
after 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% of subjects were enrolled, and have recommended the 
study to continue without change. Data are not yet available for this study. Further details 
regarding the phase 2 study may be found in the IB for CSL112. 
Thus, as of 16 November 2015, approximately 965 subjects have received at least 1 infusion 
of CSL112 in completed studies of the CSL112 clinical development program. 
1.2 STUDY OVERVIEW  
CSL112 drug product resembles nascent HDL. It is a novel formulation of apoA-I, PC, and 
cholate; and is stabilized by sucrose. CSL112 is being developed for the reduction of 
recurrent CV events after  AMI. The premise of the CSL112 mechanism of action and the 
resulting treatment strategy is that infusion of apoA -I after the index AMI  event, and  during 
the subacute period after  the event, will reduce the size and/or instability of atherosclerotic 
plaque, thereby reducing the risk of plaque rupture or erosion that would lead to a recurrent 
CV event in patients with AMI.  
Renal impairment (RI) is a  prevalent and increasingly common concurrent condition in 
patients with AMI. Patients who experience an AMI event are at high risk for a recurrent CV 
event and mortality is inversely related to renal function status: subjects with mild, moderate, and severe RI have, respectively, progressively poorer long -term prognosis as compared with 
patients with normal renal function. As the number of AMI  patients with RI is relatively high 
(~15% to 30%) ( Gibson et al, 2004; Fox et al, 2010), the identification of therapies that are

Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 33 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  safe and effective in these patients would represent an important advancement in medical 
therapy. 
This study is  a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, study to i nvestigate the safety and tolerability of up to 4 weekly IV 
administration s of CSL112 compared with placebo in subjects with moderate RI (eGFR ≥ 30 
and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and AMI.  
CSL112 drug product contains sucrose as a stabilizer. Administration of s ucrose by IV 
infusion has been associated with reports of acute kidney injury (AKI) attributed to osmotic 
nephrosis when immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products formulated with sucrose were 
administered at high doses or high rates of administration ( Epstein and Zoon, 2000). Thus, 
evaluation of the renal safety of CSL112 is warranted, specifically in the subpopulation of patients with moderate RI who have experienced a recent AMI event. Although no renal 
safety concerns were identified in the completed CSL112 phase 1 and 2a studies (n=126 total 
subjects treated with CSL112: 96 with normal renal function, 15 with mild RI , and 15 with 
moderate RI ), further evaluation is warranted before  the inclusion of AMI patients with 
moderate RI in a phase 3 morbidity and mortality outcomes trial.    
This study is intended to characterize the renal risk profile in subjects with moderate RI who 
have experienced a recent AMI. The occurrence of clinically important renal serious adverse 
events (SAEs) as reported by the Investigator and AKI, defined as an  increase in serum 
creatinine of  ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) from baseline that is sustained upon repeat 
measurement , will be evaluated.  In subjects with moderate RI who have undergone 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the occurrence of AKI as defined by the Acute 
Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria is approximately 10% (Tsai et al, 2014). After 
excluding subjects with evidence of AKI at screening , the effect of 4 weekly infusions of 
CSL112 or placebo on the incidences of renal SAEs and AKI will be evaluated  in this study 
of post-AMI moderate RI patients.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  1.3 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
The Development C ore Safety Information  document (appended to the IB for CSL112) 
outlines the potential risks to subjects administered CSL112 and precautions for its use.  
The most frequently reported AEs in completed clinical studies of CSL112 included: Infusion 
Site Pain, Infusion Site Swelling, Infusion Site Induration, Infusion Site Erythema, Infusion 
Site Coldness, Injection Site Phlebitis, Catheter Site Phlebitis, Infusion Site Haematoma, 
Injection Site Haematoma, Vessel Puncture Site Haematoma, and Vessel Puncture S ite 
Haemorrhage. Headache was also frequently reported in these studies. Events related to injection or infusion site reactions, local tolerability events related to bruising  (coded to a 
Preferred Term [PT] Haematoma in the Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities  
[MedDRA ]), and Headache were reported more frequently in subjects who received CSL112 
as compared with placebo. Most of these events were mild and transient. Adverse events (AEs) reported within other System Organ Classes (SOCs) occurred with similar frequency in 
the placebo and active treatment groups across the 4 completed CSL112 studies. No renal 
safety concerns were identified in the completed CSL112 phase 1 or 2a studies. 
A thorough panel for renal assessment has been integrated into the current study, as CSL112 
contains sucrose as a stabilizer, and administration of sucrose IV has been associated with 
reports of AKI attributed to osmotic nephrosis when IGIV products formulated with sucrose 
were administered at high doses or at high rates of administration. The highest dose of sucrose administered in the completed phase 2a study in patients with stable atherothrombotic 
disease and normal renal function or mild RI did not exceed the lowest dose published in the 
literature associated with pote ntial nephrotoxicity ( Anderson and Bethea, 1940). CSL112 has 
been reformulated such that the maximum dose of sucrose to be administered in this study is approximately 2.5-fold less than this lowest single dose of sucrose that was associated with 
histopathologic changes in the kidney but without clinical evidence of nephrotoxicity. In 
addition, the maximum infusion rate for CSL112 of 6 g/2 hour (50 mg/min) ensures a sucrose 
infusion rate of ≤ 1.7 mg sucrose/kg/min for a 50- kg adult, which is well within the published

Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 35 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  guideline for safe administration of sucrose containing IGIV products ( Epstein and Zoon, 
2000).  
In the completed phase 1 and 2a clinical studies with CSL112, no clinically significant 
elevations (> 3 x upper limit of normal [ ULN]) in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) or 
alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) have been reported in 126 subjects who have received 
CSL112. One subject treated with a single 135 mg/kg dose of CSL112 in the SAD study 
experienced a transient elevation in total bilirubin > 2 x ULN at a single time point. No AEs 
were reported in association with this laboratory finding. Two subjects with moderate RI 
treated with CSL112 6 g in Study CSL112_1001 had treatment-emergent non- serious AEs of 
“Blood B ilirubin Increased” for transient elevations at a single time point on Study Day 2 
(maximum of 1.16 x ULN). One subject with normal renal function treated with CSL112 6 g 
in Study CSL112_1001 had an elevation in total bilirubin to > 1.5 x ULN but less than 2 x 
ULN at a single time point on Study Day 2 that was not reported as a treatment- emergent AE  
(TEAE). In the phase 2b study (Study CSLCT- HDL-12-77), 2 reports of serious liver 
dysfunction (L iver Disorder and H epatic Function Abnormal ) have been received as of 
2 May 2016. Each event was assessed as related to investigational product by the Investigator. Both cases demonstrated a mixed cholestatic and hepatocellular picture, and 
neither subject was considered as meeting Hy’s Law criteria. These cases were reviewed by 
the DSMB immediately after they were reported, and the DSMB determined that the study 
may continue without modification. A thorough panel for hepatic assessment has also been 
incorporated into the protocol and the study will be conducted under oversight by the 
program level DSMB. 
No SAEs were reported in the SAD or MAD phase 1 studies and no SAEs were reported in 
the phase 2a study in subjects who received CSL112.  In Study CSL112_1001, 2 subjects with normal renal function who received CSL112 6 g 
experienced a total of 2 SAEs during the A ctive Treatment Period that were not related to 
investigational product (pain in right shoulder [due to loosened osteosynthesis plate], injury

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  of right meniscus). There were no deaths and no subject discontinued from the study because 
of a TEAE.  
In the phase 2b study (Study CSLCT- HDL-12-77), as of 2 May 2016, 4 SAEs were reported 
for 4 subjects as related to investigational product by the Investigator ( Pharyngeal Oedema 
[1 subject], Hepatic Function Abnormal [2 subjects], Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage 
[1 subject]). Eight subjects had 18 SAEs with a fatal outcome and were assessed as not 
related to investigational product by the Investigator (Pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Failure, Cardiac Arrest, Pneumothorax, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Hypoxic Ischemic 
Encephalopathy; Septic Shock; Basal Ganglia Haemorrhage; Cerebral Haemorrhage, Brain Metastatic Cancer; Cardiac Failure [2 events]; Shock Haemorrhagic, Multiple Organ 
Dysfunction Syndrome; Cardiac Aneurysm, Pulmonary Embolus, and Death).  On 21 
December  2015, based on review of safety and PK data after 75% of subjects had completed 
the Active Treatment Period , the program level DSMB determined that there were no 
significant safety or PK concerns and recommended that the study continue under the current 
protocol without modification. 
The risk of viral and prion contamination is a feature common to all biologic agents where 
the manufacture involves the use of materials of animal or human origin. CSL112 may carry 
a risk of transmitting infectious agents ( eg, viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease agent) because it is made from human blood. However, the risk of infectious agent transmission has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain 
viruses, testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and including virus 
inactivation / removal steps in the manufacturing process.  
There is potential for allergic reactions or hypersensitivit y to CSL112 in certain individuals, 
given the constituents of the product. CSL112 consists of apoA-I isolated from human plasma 
that may contain immunoglobulin A (IgA) and also contains PC derived from soy beans. 
Therefore, subjects with a positive history of IgA deficiency, antibodies to IgA, or allergy to 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 37 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  either soy bean or peanuts will be excluded from the study. In addition, study level stopping 
rules will provide guidance if there are occurrences of serious drug hypersensitivity AEs . 
It is the central premise of the CSL112 program that infusion of apoA-I via reconstituted 
HDL will provide therapeutic benefit to patients with AMI. Based on the previous clinical 
data, the dose of CSL112 selected for use in this study  should raise cholesterol efflux 
capacity by a meaningful amount. The increase in cholesterol efflux capacity of blood plasma 
may enable the acceptance of excess cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaque. The resulting 
reduction in plaque cholesterol should render the plaques more stable and less  likely to 
rupture. This and other purported apoA- I related actions may translate to a reduction in the 
subacute risk of cardiac ischemia and recurrent CV events in patients with AMI.  
Thus, the associated benefit risk assessment of the study is acceptable for subjects enrolled in 
the study. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 PRIMARY O BJECTIVE AND ENDPOINT  
2.1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is  to assess the renal safety of CSL112 in subjects with 
moderate RI and AMI after administration of up to 4 weekly  infusions of CSL112. 
2.1.2 Co-primary Endpoint s 
The renal safety profile of CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI and AMI who receive up to 4 weekly administrations of CSL112 will be assessed by co-primary endpoints of the 
incidences of treatment -emergent (1) renal SAEs as defined below, and (2) AKI, defined as 
an absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmo l/L) during the 
Active Treatment Period  that is sustained upon repeat measurement by the central laboratory 
no earlier than 24 hours after the elevated value.  If no repeat value is obtained [due, for

days apart, during a 4- week Active Treatment Period . Study assessments for all subjec ts will 
be conducted before and after infusions during Visits 2, 4, 5, 6 (Study Days 1, 8, 15, 22), 
within 24 to 48 hours after the first infusion (Visit 3) and at the end of the Active Treatment 
Period (Visit 7/Study Day  29). Follow-up safety assessments will be conducted at a final visit 
(Visit 8) on Study Day  60. 
Depending on the time of the index event , time required for evaluation in the emergency 
department  and cardiac catheterization laboratory, administration of contrast agent, and 
assessment of renal function  stability, screening duration may last up to 5 day s after FMC for 
the index AMI. First medical contact  is defined as the point in time (ie , clock start) at which 
the subject arrives at the hospital emergency department (ie, door time) or cardiac 
catheterization laboratory , for evaluation and treatment of AMI . A diagnosis of AMI as per 
Section 4.1.1 is critical to determining subject eligibility .  
Before the first infusion of investigational product, the subject must be clinically  stable, have 
hepatic function test within acceptable limits, and have documented evidence of stable renal 
function and no suspicion of AKI at least 12 hours after FMC for the index AMI. In addition, 
for those subjects undergoing angiography with or without PCI, stable renal function, defined as a serum creatinine value that is increased < 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) from the pre -contrast 
administration value , must be demonstrated at least 12 hours after IV contrast administration 
(see Section  8.2.2.1, Table 7). The first infusion of investigational product should occur no 
earlier than 12 hours after FMC or, for subjects undergoing angiography, no earlier than 
12 hours after contrast administration . The first infusion should start no later than 5 day s after 
FMC for the index AMI.  Within this screening window, earlier administration of the first 
infusion of investigational product is encouraged. 
Screening and randomization of subjects may occur on the same day ( Study Day 1 of the 
Active Treatment Period ) provided that the minimum time window after FMC for the index 
event or administration of IV contrast agent (for subjects undergoing angiography) is adhered

investigational product (Section 8.2.2.1).  
Ongoing eligibility for all subsequent infusions of investigational product will be confirmed 
before administration of each subsequent dose. Eligibility for continued administration of 
investigational product will be based on the criteria presented in Section  8.2.2.2, Table 8. 
Each infusion should be completed as close to the protocol- specified visit schedule as 
possible, ie , no fewer than 7 days and no more than 10 days between each infusion. An 
infusion may be skipped or delayed at the discretion of the Investigator if more time is 
necessary to confirm renal function stability or to evaluate and treat an AE before the next 
infusion (Section 8.2.2.2). If an infusion is skipped or delayed for a medical or safety reason, 
the medical monitor should be contacted for further guidance.  
Using the maximum interval of 10 days between infusions, the 4 infusions should be 
administered w ithin 30 days from Study Day 1 (Visit 2). Visit 7 (Study Day 29) must be at 
least 7 (+3) days after the fou rth infusion of investigational product. However, depending on 
the actual timing of the 4 infusions, Study Day 29 could occur between 28 to 40 days after 
the first infusion. Where administration of all 4 infusions may exceed the duration of 30 days 
the medical monitor should be informed for furth er guidance. 
The end of the Active Treatment Period  is upon completion of Visit 7 ( Study Day 29). The 
Safety Follow -up Period (approximately 30 days in duration) will begin after Visit 7 .  
Visit 8 will occur approximately 60 (+7) days after the first infusion and must occur no 
sooner than 25 days after the last administration of investigational product. Subjects will 
return to the study clinic and be seen by the Investigator or qualified delegate for study 
assessments at Visit 8. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit between  signing of 
informed consent and Visit 8. 
Subjects who have prematurely  discontinued receiving infusion(s) of investigational product 
should complete an early termination visit (Section 4.1.4). All study assessments to be

Visit 7. Subjects who have discontinued investigational product early should continue to be 
followed for safety  through Visit 8. If the subject cannot be contacted directly to obtain vital 
status (ie, living or deceased) , at a minimum, s ites should obtain as much information as 
possible through telephone contact with he althcare providers, registered mail contact, contact 
through family or friends or utilization of publically available information. 
An external  program level DSMB will independently evaluate safety data during the conduct 
of the study. In order to ensure that an early safety signal has not emerged that would affect 
the conduct of the study the DSMB will review safety data after every 6 subjects have 
received 2 infusions of investigational product and have pre- infusion safety data available 
before the third infusion at Visit 5. These reviews will continue until at least 60 subjects  
(approximately 75% of subjects) complete Visit 5.  In addition, the independent DSMB will 
have interim safety reviews when : (1) approximately  25% of subjects have complet ed the 
Active Treatment Period  (Visit 7), (2) approximately 50% of subjects have completed Visit 5, 
and (3) approximately 50% of subjects have completed the Active Treatment Period  (Visit 7).  
At these reviews the DSMB will assess for any safety signal that  has emerged and that would 
warrant a change in the conduct of the study. The DSMB will also be convened to review all available data if 1 or more of the study level stopping rules is met (see Section 3.6.2).

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Figure 1. Study Overview  
 
AMI = acute myocardial infarction; IV = intravenous; FMC = first medical contact  
The study will consist of screening and 2 study periods: an Active Treatment Period  (approximately 29  days) 
and a Safety Follow -up Period  (approximately 30 days from the end of the Active Treatment Period ).  
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility during screening and up to and including randomization (Visit 1 an d 
Visit 2 before infusion), which may occur no later than 5 days after  FMC for the index AMI. Eligible subjects 
meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclu sion criteria will receive four  2-hour IV infusions of 
investigational product ( 6 g CSL112 or placebo), a minimum of 7 days apart, during a 4- week Active Treatment 
Period. 
3.2 DOSE AND DOSING REGIMEN  
CSL112 ( 6 g) or a matched volume of placebo (0.9% weight/volume [w / v] sodium chloride 
solution, ie, normal saline) will be administered as a 2 -hour IV infusion into a suitable vein 
(peripheral or central) once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks ( 4 infusions total). 
A 6 g dose of CSL112 has been selected for this study, based upon the DSMB review of 
safety and PK data from the ongoing phase 1 PK and safety study in subjects with moderate 
RI (Study CSL112_1001).

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  The program level DSMB will: 
• Provide recommendations to CSL  surrounding study conduct matters that affect safety . 
• Review the safety data at the planned interim safety reviews (see Section  10.3.4) and 
identify if significant safety  concerns arise during the study. 
• Review all available data if 1 or more of the study level stopping rules  is met (see Section 
3.6.2) 
• Review PK data and any other data that may affect  subject or study continuation. 
• Make recommendations regarding study progression. 
In order to ensure that a safety signal has not emerged that would affect the conduct of the 
study, the DSMB will review safety data after every 6 subjects have received 2 infusions of 
investigational product and have pre- infusion safety data available before the third infusion at 
Visit 5. These reviews will continue until at least 60 subjects  (approximately 75% of 
subjects) complete Visit 5. In addition , the independent DSMB will have interim safety 
reviews when: (1) approximately 25% of subjects have completed the Active Treatment 
Period (Visit 7), (2) approximately 50% of subjects have completed Visit 5, and ( 3) 
approximately 50% of subjects have completed the Active Treatment Period  (Visit 7).  
If any of the safety criteria as specified in the DSMB charter are met at these reviews, continuation of the study without alteration should be questioned as it may be an early 
indication of an unacceptable safety profile in the broader population. The DSMB may 
recommend a change to the protocol to ameliorate any safety concerns  or provide 
recommendations regarding subsequent dosing and/or study progression/stopping as discussed in the following paragraph.  
The DSMB will also be convened to review all available data if 1 or more of the study level 
stopping rules is met (Section 3.6.2). If any of the criteria listed below are met, the DSMB 
will be notified in an expedited fashion and will convene in a timely manner to review all 
available study data and to provide recommendations regarding subsequent dosing and/ or

data and reached a final recommendation will be made using best clinical judgment by the 
DSMB chairman. Any modification recommended by the DSMB in regards to the conduct of 
the study will be implemented as an amendment to the protocol. In addition, the DSMB may 
decide to meet and review all available safety data based on other safety signals not described 
below. The stopping rule triggers for DSMB decision are:  
• After 2 subjects experience a treatment -emergent SAE of AKI and after each subsequent 
subject experiences such an event.  
• After 2 subjects experience an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 3 x the baseline value or a 
serum creatinine of ≥ 4.0 mg/dL (353.6 μmol/L ) and after each subsequent subject 
experiences such an event.  
• After 1 subject experiences a treatment -emergent SAE of acute hepatic injury and after 
each subsequent subject experiences such an event.  
• After 1 subject experiences a treatment -emergent elevation in ALT > 3 x ULN with a 
concomitant elevation in total bilirubin > 2 x ULN and after each subsequent subject 
experiences such an event.  
• After 2 subjects experience a treatment -emergent SAE of drug hypersensitivity reaction 
and after each subsequent subject experiences such an event.  
All of the above criteria will be reported by the Investigator  as SAEs in order to ensure 
expedited reporting of these events to the Sponsor and the DSMB as per Section 9.5.1.

In addition, individual subject level criteria for discontinuation of investigational product are 
detailed in Section 7.1. 
3.6.3 Steering Committee  
A Steering Committee will provide clinical guidance on study implementation, conduct, and 
interpretation of results. The Steering Committee will comprise designated repres entatives 
from among the Principal Investigators, other recognized thought leaders in the field of ACS 
AKI, and lipidology, as well as sponsor representatives. The Steering Committee will be 
described in further detail in its charter.  
3.6.4 Clinical Events Comm ittee 
The independent program level Clinical Events Committee ( CEC) will review and adjudicate  
in a blinded fashion the occurrence of renal SAEs and bleeding  events. A common group of 
qualified scientists and physicians will prepare the definitions of endpoints and instructions 
for interpretation based on available guidance . The CEC is described in further detail in its 
charter.

5. Documented evidence of stable renal function and no clinical suspicion of AKI at least 
12 hours after FMC for the index AMI. For subjects undergoing angiography with or 
without PCI, stable renal function must be confirmed at least 12 hours after IV contrast 
and is defined as a serum creatinine value that is < 0.3 mg/dL increased from the pre -
contrast administration value. If the local laboratory post-contrast serum creatinine value 
is increased ≥  0.3 mg/dL from the pre- contrast administration value, the laboratory test 
may be repeated once at least 24 hours after the initial assessment  to assess stable renal 
function. The repeat serum creatinine value must be increased < 0.3 mg/dL from the 
pre-contrast administration value and there must be no suspicion of AKI for the subject to 
be eligible  to receive the first infusion ( Table 7).  
NOTE: If multiple local laboratory tests are obtained before the administration of 
contrast agent, the serum creatinine value closest in time but before  contrast 
administration should be used as the reference value used  to assess stability of renal 
function. 
6. Female subjects must be post- menopausal or with a negative urine pregnancy test at the 
screening visit and before randomization.

skipped or delayed at the discretion of the Investigator if more time is necessary to confirm 
renal function stability or to evaluate and treat an AE before the next infusion 
(Section 8.2.2.2). If an infusion is skipped or delayed for a medical or safety reason, the 
medical monitor should be contacted, and the remaining infusions should be completed as 
close to the protocol-specified visit schedule as possible. 
4.1.4 Study and Subject Completion, Study Treatment Discontinuation and 
Withdrawal from Study  
4.1.4.1 Study Completion  
The study will be considered completed when either the pre- specified study completion is 
reached (all randomized subjects either complete Visit 8/Study Day 60, have withdrawn from 
the study, or have been lost to follow-up) or the study is terminated early based on 
recommendation of the independent DSMB and endorsement by the Steering Committee.  
Subjects for whom infusions of investigational product have been discontinued early should 
complete early termination procedures (Visit 7) and should be encouraged, if consent is not 
withdrawn , to continue follow-up for safety  as specified through Visit 8 (Schedule of 
Assessments). 
4.1.4.2 Subject Completion  
A subject will be considered as having completed the study if he or she has completed 
Visit 8.

Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 58 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Until the study completes, all subjects who are randomized will have follow -up visits as 
specified by protocol ( Schedule of Ass essments).  
If a subject is unwilling or unable to return for scheduled on- site follow-up visits, sites should 
attempt to collect as much visit information as possible, through telephone conta ct, registered 
mail contact, contact through family or friends, or use  of publically available information. 
This latter source may be the only available option for subjects who withdraw consent during 
the study (see Section 4.1.4.4). All efforts should be made to confirm vital status at a 
minimum.  
4.1.4.3 Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Subjects may request at any time that further investigational product administration be 
discontinued, or it may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or 
CSL Behring LLC ( CSLB) for safety, behavio ral or administrative reasons ( eg, due to an AE, 
protocol deviation, or study termination). The reason for early discontinuation of 
investigational product should be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  
In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Investigator always has the option to advise a subject to stop 
further administration of investigational product if the subject's safety or well-being is compromised by the continued administration of investigational product. Concern for the 
interests of the subject m ust always prevail over the interests of the study.  
If a subject prematurely discontinues study treatment and if consent is not withdrawn, every effort should be made to inform the subject of the importance of continuing in the study to 
ensure that the relevant follow -up safety assessments of Visit 7 (7  to 10 days after last 
infusion) and Visit 8 (at least 25 days after last infusion) are performed ( Schedule of 
Assessments). If only 1 additional study visit is to be performed after subject discontinuation, 
the procedures in study Visit7 should be performed. At minimum, all efforts should be made

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  to confirm vital status if a subject is unwilling or unable to retu rn for scheduled on- site visits 
or refuses to be contacted by telephone.  
In addition to the above considerations, serum creatinine, total bilirubin, and ALT must be 
assessed during the Active Treatment Period  by the local laboratory and reviewed by the 
Investigator before administration of investigational product infusions 2, 3, and 4 to 
determine continuing eligibility ; see criteria presented in Section  8.2.2.2, Table 8. 
In the event that a subject experiences a hypersensitivity reaction during t he infusion of 
investigational product, the infusion must be immediately discontinued and the subject must 
receive immediate medical assessment and indicated supportive management per the 
institutional standard of care (see Section 7.1).  
If a female subject becomes pregnant, she must discontinue treatment with the investigational product, but will continue other study procedures unless not advised to do so at the discretion of the Investigator. All pregnancies must be reported according to Section 9.7.2.  
4.1.4.4 Subject Withdrawal from the Study  
Subject withdrawal from the s tudy is defined as the subject’s withdrawal of consent from 
further participation in the study, including any contact by the investigational site personnel 
to determine the health status of the subject.    
When a subject is contemplating withdrawal from the study, the Investigator (not 
coordinator) must discuss with the subject the importance of further follow-up and how 
follow-up information can be obtained (in-person visit, phone, mail, via 3
rd party, revi ew of 
medical records). The above discussion must be documented in the subject’s medical record. If at all possible, in-person visits for subjects contemplating early withdrawal should include 
an early termination visit including procedures specified at Vi sit 7 (Schedule of 
Assessments).  If no further follow -up is allowed due to subject’s decision, the reason must be 
documented in the eCRF. In such instances, t he site should collect vital status at a minimum

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  in all randomized subjects using publicly available records as permitted by national and/or 
local regulatory requirements .  
In accordance with ICH principles of GCP, the Investigator  always has the option to advise a 
subject to withdraw from the study. Concern for the interests of the subject must always 
prevail over the interests of the study.  
If a subject withdraws from the study, they will continue to have access to medical care as per 
routine local  medical practice.  
If the subject withdraws from the study, CSLB will retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent, in accordance with prevailing regulatory 
guidance.  
4.1.5 Procedures for Handling Withdrawals  
Procedures for subjects who decide to withdrawal early from the study or who are withdrawn 
by the Investigator are discussed in Section 4.1.4. 
If a subject declines further participation or is withdrawn from the study, attempts will be 
made to complete and document the final assessment. If at all possible, this final assessment 
should include the assessments and procedures specified for Visit 7 ( Schedule of 
Assessments).  If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for 
disclosure of future information, CSL B may retain and continue to use any data collected 
before such withdrawal of consent. 
In the event that a subject withdraws from the study, the Investigator should record t he reason 
and date of withdrawal in the eCRF  and in the subject's medical records.

5.3 ACCOUNTABILITY AND DESTRUCTION 
All supplies of investigational product must be accounted for throughout the study. At the end of the study, the Drug Inventory Report, dated and signed by the Investigator or delegate 
(eg, pharmacist), must be retained at the study site as verification of  final accountability of 
CSL112. An unblinded Clinical Monitor will conduct study drug accountability. 
Records for the delivery of investigational product to the study site, the inventory at the study 
site, the use by each subject, and the destruction or return of investigational product to CSLB 
must be maintained by the Investigator (or delegate). The records will include dates, 
quantities, and unique code numbers assigned to investigational product and unique code numbers assigned to the subjects. 
Information on the destruction of CSL112 or placebo is provided in the study reference 
manuals.

6.1 ALLOCATION TO TREATM ENT 
6.1.1 Subject Assignment  
After providing written informed consent, the subject will be issued  via an IRT system a 
study-level unique subject ID number. The subject ID number will be used to identify the 
subject for the duration of the study. Subject ID numbers will not be reassigned or reused.   
6.1.2 Randomization Procedures  
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active treatment versus placebo 
by means of the IRT. Randomization will be stratified by eGFR (30  to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
or 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) as calculated by the IRT using the CKD -EPI equation ( Levey 
et al, 2009; Stevens et al, 2010) and by medical history of diabetes requiring current treatment with  any anti-diabetic medication (yes or no) . The IRT will assign the appropriate 
study treatment to each subject. CSL B or a delegate will supply the Investigator with a user 
guide for the IRT system. The IRT will use centralized randomization and fixed -size blocks. 
To ensure the study blind is maintained, a CSLB statistician / delegate not directly involved in the analysis of study results will prepare the study randomization code. The unblinded 
CSLB statistician/delegate will keep the randomization code on file.  
6.1.3 Blinding Procedures  
6.1.3.1 Blinding Method 
Physical measures of blinding will be used to mask the identity of the investigational product 
due to the physical characteristics of CSL112 when reconstituted ( ie, pale yellow/straw color 
with slight foaming characteristics). Information on the physical measures of blinding u sed to 
mask the identity of the investigational product will be provided in the study reference 
manuals.

per Section  6.1.3.1) delegated by the Investigator will administer the investigational product 
by IV infusion, in a suitable peripheral or central vein. A dedicated IV line should be used for administration of investigational product. Patency of the IV line should be ensured before the 
start of the infusion. After the completion of the infusion the IV line should be flushed with 
saline. If the infusion is interrupted for any reason, the total duration of the infusion should 
not exceed 3 hours. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive a volume of 
placebo matched to the corresponding CSL112 infusion volume. 
Before starting an infusion of investigational product, the Investigator or a medically 
qualified delegate should assess each subject for presence of hypovolemia, which may 
include signs of dry mouth, skin tenting, orthostasis, dizziness, etc. If hypovolemia is 
suspected or confirmed, the Investigator or medically qualified delegate should administer IV 
replacement fluid as clinically indicated. During the infusion,  subjects should be encouraged 
to drink fluids. 
Subjects should be advised to sit down or lie in a semi-supine position while receiving the 
infusion. If necessary, upon completion of the infusion subjects should be escorted as per 
site's standard of procedures to ensure their safety . 
All subjects should be monitored for drug hypersensitivity reaction for at least 1 hour after the end of the first and second infusions of investigational product. Extension of the duration 
of the monitoring time and/or monitoring after administration of the third  and fourth  
infusions of investigational product may be done at the discretion of the Investigator  as 
clinically indicated.  Study site personnel who are medically qualified to recognize and treat 
drug hypersensitivity r eactions must be available together with medications and equipment to 
treat such reactions.  All possible drug hypersensitivity reactions require follow up until 
resolution (Section 7.1).  
Before departing from the clinic and after completion of the infusion and all other study assessments, all subjects should be asked to void. If a subject is unable to void before  leaving

able to void. 
6.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
All doses of investigational product will be administered by IV infusion at the study site. 
Subjects will be considered to have received a complete dose of investigational product if 
they receive at least 80% of investigational product and cumulative infusion interruptions (if 
any) are for no more than a total of 60  minutes. 
7. CONTRAINDICATIONS, PERMITTED THERAPIES AND 
PROHIBITTED THERAPIES  
7.1 CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS  TO FURTHER D OSING 
CSL112 has previously been administered to humans. Potential risks and guidance to the 
Investigator for use of CSL112 are provided in the Development Core Safety Information  
document (appended to the CSL112 IB). The administration of CSL112 to any subject not 
meeting the eligibility criteria for this study, or to any subject not enrolled in this study, is 
prohibited. 
There is potential for allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to CSL112 in certain individuals, 
given the constituents of the product. CSL112 consists of apoA-I isolated from human plasma 
that may contain IgA and PC derived from soy beans. Therefore, Investigator s should ensure 
that subjects do not have a positive history of IgA deficiency or antibodies to IgA and that the 
subjects are not allergic to either soy bean or peanuts (there is a documented risk of cross 
reactions to soy in known peanut allergy sufferers). 
In the event that a subject experiences a hypersensitivity reaction during the infusion, the 
infusion must be immediately discontinued and the subject must receive immediate medical 
assessment and indicated supportive management per the institutional standard of care. 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 70 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Additional assessments are to be performed if subjects experience hypersens itivity reactions 
while on the study. In the event of a potential drug hypersensitivity reaction, additional 
assessments should be performed and follow -up is required until resolution (Section 8.2.3.6). 
If a subject experiences a Grade 3 or 4 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) AE within 72 hours of administration of a dose of investigational product that is 
assessed as related to t he investigational product by the Investigator, additional doses of 
investigational product should not be administered. 
Because CSL112 is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious 
agents (eg, viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease agent). The risk of 
infectious agent transmission has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and 
including virus inactivation/removal steps in the manufacturing process. 
7.2 PERMITTED THERAPIE S 
Concomitant treatment is permitted throughout the study.  
All drugs and/or procedures currently being administered to a subject at the time of signing 
informed consent, and which are taken in ad dition to the investigational product at any time 
during the study, are regarded as concomitant therapies and must be documented as such in the eCRF.    
7.3 PROHIBITED THERAPIE S 
The following therapies are NOT PERMITTED during the study:  
• Treatment with anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted 
therapy, or gene therapy) within 3 months before the first administration of 
investigational product or at any time during the study. Recovery from associated 
toxicities ( eg, hematologic) must be documented in the source document.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  8.1.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Clinical procedures to be conducted to collect demographic information and baseline 
characteristics are provided in Table 3. These assessments will be performed at time points as 
detailed in the Schedule of Assessments . 
Table 3.  Clinical Procedures : Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Assessment  Description  
Demographics  Date of birth, years of age, sex, race, and ethnicity  
Height 
Weight Height will be recorded in centimeters (cm)  
Body weight will be recorded in kilograms (kg)  
Medical history  Relevant medical history , including cause of CKD if knowna 
Gilbert’s syndrome - historical documentation (record in eCRF) 
Prior/Conc omitant 
Therapies  Prior Therapy: All medications taken by subjects in the 4 weeks before 
screening will be recorded , including those administered for the index AMI. 
Concomitant Therapy: All medications currently being administered to a subject at the time informed consent is signed and which continue to be 
taken in addition to investigational product during the study will be recorded. 
Standard of Care 
Laboratory 
Sample: Serum 
Creatinine  Local laboratory tests obtained as part of standard of care may include 
serum creatinine measurements that will be used to determine stability of 
renal function after the index event or, for subjects undergoing angiography, 
after administration of intravenous con trast agent . If multiple laboratory 
tests are obtained before the administration of  contrast agent, the serum 
creatinine value closest in tim e but before  contrast administration should be 
used as the reference value to assess stability of  renal function ( Table 7). 
Results of t he local laboratory serum creatinine test s used as the reference 
value to assess renal function stability  should be recorded in the eCRF.  
eGFR The local laboratory serum creatinine value used to confirm stability of renal 
function before the first infusion of investigational product will be used to 
calculate baseline eGFR that will be used for stratificatio n of randomization 
by eGFR. The CKD -EPI equation (see Appendix I ) will be used for 
calculation of eGFR. This method for creatinine measurement  should be 
traceable to IDMS standard s. 
AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CKD -EPI = Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration; eCRF = 
electronic case report form; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; IDMS = isotope dilution mass 
spectrometry; MI  = myocardial infarction; PRBCs = packed red blood cells  
a. Including but not limited to prior MI, history of stable or unstable angina, coronary revascularization or 
surgery, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, valvular heart disease, heart rhythm disorders, cerebrovascular disease, any clinically-significant bleeding event

3 months, with implications for health.  
 
8.1.2 Safety 
The incidence, severity or intensity , and causality of AEs will be evaluated according to the 
criteria and for  the duration of the observation period as specified in Section 9.  
Clinical procedures to be conducted before and throughout the study to evaluate safety are 
provided in Table 4. Assessments for safety evaluation  will be performed at time points  as 
detailed in the Schedule of Assessments . More frequent evaluations may be performed in the 
case of an AE, if clinically indicated, at the discretion of the Investigator . Clinical laboratory 
test results that are outside the normal reference range and are deemed clinically significant by the Investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. If clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory test results are identified after investigational product infusion, the test(s) will be repeated until the values return to normal and/or baseline values . Safety assessment 
parameters should be repeated if the specimen is hemolyzed. Refer to the study reference manuals for detailed instructions on how the assessments should be performed.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  8.2.1.1 Medical History and Assessment for Study Eligibility  
The subjects’ past medical history  and demographic information will be documented at 
screening. As defined in the inclusion criteria, Section 4.1.1, assessment of renal function 
status for the presence of moderate RI  based on eGFR and evidence of myocardial necrosis in 
a clinical setting consistent with a type I (spontaneous) AMI will be evaluated. A medical 
history will be obtained by the Investigator or a medically qualified delegate. Medical history 
includes all active conditions, and any condition diagnosed within 3 months before the screening visit . Such conditions may  include but are not limited to prior MI, history of stable 
or unstable angina, coronary revascularization or surgery, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, congestive  heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, valvular heart disease, 
heart rhythm disorders, cerebrovascular disease, or any clinically-significant bleeding event 
requiring transfusion of > 2 units packed red blood cells (P RBCs) within the past 3 months or 
a discontinuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. If possible, documented evidence 
of CKD within the 6 months before admission for the index AMI should be obtained (eg, 
prior serum creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, suspected etiology of CKD). 
8.2.1.2 Screening and Randomization on Same Day 
Screening and randomization of subjects may occur on the same day ( Study Day 1 of the 
Active Treatment Period ) provided that the minimum time for assessment of renal function  
stability is adhered to before administratio n of the first infusion of investigational product 
(Section 8.2.2.1). To receive the first infusion of investigational product, subjects must have 
documented evidence of stable renal function and no suspicion of AKI at least 12 hours after 
FMC for the index A MI event. For subjects undergoing angiography, stable renal function is 
defined as a local laboratory serum creatinine value at least 12 hour after contrast 
administration that is increased < 0.3 mg/dL from the pre -contrast administration value. See 
Section 8.2.2.1 for repeating post-contrast assessment s of renal function. The screening 
period up to and including randomization must occur within 5 days of FMC for the index 
AMI.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Local laboratory values for serum creatinine, ALT, and total bilirubin obtained as part of 
standard of care may be used for evaluating renal and hepatic function . If multiple laboratory 
tests are obtained before the administration of contrast agent, the serum creatinine value 
closest in time  but before  IV contrast administration should be used to assess stable renal 
function. Similarly, the serum creatinine value obtained after, but closest in time to the 
minimum window required after FMC or, for subjects undergoing angiography, after IV 
contrast administration should be used to confirm renal function stability before  
administration of the first infusion  (Table 7). The pre-contrast and baseline serum creatinine 
values used to confirm renal function stability must be documented in the eCRF.  
If screening and randomization occur on the same day, all protocol specified procedures and 
assessments indicated at Visit 1 and Visit 2 (Baseline/before infusion) in the  Schedule of 
Assessments must still be performed , although certain assessments do not need to be 
duplicated . If Visits 1 and 2 are combined , there may be a single blood draw for central 
laboratory serum biochemistry, and local laboratory ALT, total bilirubin, and serum 
creatinine. Both a local laboratory and central laboratory urinalysis should be performed. 
There may be 1 ECG. Single assessments of vital signs, concomitant medications, and AEs  
are also acceptable.  
8.2.2 Infusion Eligibility  
8.2.2.1 First Infusion  
In addition to confirming hemodynamic stability, both hepatic (ALT and total bilirubin) and renal (serum creatinine) function, based on local laboratory values, must be reviewed by the 
Investigator and determined to be within acceptable limits before administration of the first 
infusion of investigational product ( Table 7). The screening period up to and including 
randomization must occur within 5 days of FMC for the index AMI. 
For the pre-infusion assessment of hepatic function  before the first infusion, the following 
criteria apply:

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  • ALT value must be ≤ 3 x ULN and total bilirubin value must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN 
(Section 4.1.2). 
• If the baseline ALT is > 3 x ULN, the subject is not  eligible for dosing . 
• If the baseline total bilirubin value is > 1.5 x ULN, the subject is not  eligible for dosing 
unless there is historical docume ntation of Gilbert’s syndrome. In this instance, the 
Investigator or a medically qualified delegate should confirm historical documentation of Gilbert’s syndrome with the medical monitor.    
• A repeat baseline assessment for hepatic function is not permitted.  
All subjects must have documented evidence of stable renal function and no suspicion of AKI 
at least 12 hours after FMC  for the index AMI. For subjects undergoing angiography with or 
without PCI, stable renal function is defined as a serum creatinine value at least 12 hours 
after contrast administration that is increased < 0.3 mg/dL from the pre- contrast 
administration value ( Table 7).   
If multiple laboratory tests are obtained before the administration of contrast agent, the serum 
creatinine value closest in time but before  IV contrast administration should be used as the 
reference value to assess stable renal function.  Similarly, the serum creatinine value obtained 
after, but closest in time to  the minimum time  required after FMC for the index AMI or, for 
subjects undergoing angiography, after IV contrast administration should be the baseline 
value used to confirm renal function stability before administration of the first infusion.  
These pre-contrast and baseline serum creatinine values used to confirm renal function 
stability must be documented in the eCRF.  
If the post-contrast serum creatinine value is increased ≥ 0.3 mg/dL from the pre- contrast 
administration value, the laboratory test may be repeated once at least 24 hours later to assess 
stable renal function. The repeat serum creatinine value must be increased < 0.3 mg/dL from 
the pre-contrast administration value for the subject to be eligible , provided no clinical 
suspicion of AKI exists.

CRD-TPL-077 Version 1.0 Confidential  8.2.2.2 Subsequent Infusions  
For infusions 2, 3, and 4, hepatic (ALT and total bilirubin) and renal (serum creatinine) 
function is to be assessed within 48 hours of the infusion using the local laboratory. The 
results must be reviewed by the Investigator and determined to be clinically stable before 
each administration of i nvestigational product. Eligibility for continued administration of 
investigational product will be based on the criteria presented below and summarized  in 
Table 8. 
For assessment of hepatic function before infusion 2 or subsequent infusions, the following 
criteria apply: 
• ALT value must be ≤ 3 x ULN and total bilirubin value must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN for 
eligibility  
• If the ALT value is > 3 x ULN or total bilirubin value is > 1.5 x ULN, the infusion must 
be delayed  and ALT and/ or total bilirubin values may be repeated  once at least 24 hours 
after the initial assessment to determine dosing eligibility and hepatic stability.  If the 
subject has a medical history of Gilbert’s syndrome, indirect bilirubin may be used 
instead of total bilirubin to determine dosing eligibility.  
• If the repeated assessment of ALT value is > 3 x ULN OR total bilirubin value is 
> 1.5 x ULN and the observed variation is not attributable to Gilbert’s syndrome, the 
subject is not eligible for continued dosing and all remaining infusions  must be 
discontinued. If the subject has a history of Gilbert’s syndrome, indirect bilirubin may be 
used instead of total bilirubin to determine dosing eligibility.  
For assessment of renal function before infusion 2 or subsequent infusions, the following criteria apply: 
• Change from baseline (pre-infusion on Study Day 1) in serum creatinine must be 
< 0.3 mg/dL .   
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
 Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 85 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Version 1.0 Confidential  • If the serum creatinine value is increased 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL from baseline value before 
infusion 2 or subsequent infusions, the subject is eligible for dosing if the observed 
variation may be attributable to changes in concomitant medications with hemodynamic 
effect or other clinical factors ( eg, IV fluid discontinued) or falls within range of 
variability previously observed for the subject. If the variation cannot be attributed to 
above, then perform repeat assessments before  dosing as per Table 8. 
• If the serum creatinine value is increased > 0.5 mg/dL from baseline value before 
infusion 2 or subsequent infusions, the infusion should be delayed until a minimum of 
2 subsequent serum creatinine determinations performed at least 24 hours apart are 
< 0.3 mg/ dL increased from the baseline. If the creatinine does not return to < 0.3 mg/dL, 
on 2 subsequent repeat assessments, the infusion will be delayed, and a repeat serum creatinine will be assessed at 7 days (±  24 h) from the pre-infusion assessment ( ie, the 
initial assessment before the delayed dose). At the time of the delayed infusion, the 
medical monitor should be contacted for further guidance regarding timing of subsequent 
infusions of investigational product. If after 7 days, the creatinine is < 0.3 mg/dL 
increased from baseline, an additional serum creatinine  should be performed at least 
24 hours later in order to confirm that the value is still <  0.3 mg/dL increased from 
baseline before subsequent dosing. The subject will be eligible only if ≥ 2 repeat values 
performed at least 24 hours apart are each < 0.3 mg/dL increased from baseline. In 
addition, dosing should proceed only if the subject is assessed as clinically stable by the 
Investigator. If after 7 days the creatinine is still ≥ 0.3 mg/dL increased from the baseline 
value, all subsequent infusions will be discontinued (see Table 8). 
If any administration of investigational product is discontinued due to these eligibility 
laboratory criteria, the abnormal laboratory parameter should be followed with central 
laboratory testing performed at 48 - to 72-hour intervals, or as clinically indicated, until the 
abnormal value returns to the subject’s pre-infusion baseline value or renal and/or hepatic 
function is stabilized .

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  8.2.3 Safety 
8.2.3.1 Adverse Events  
Incidence, grade, and causality of AEs, including SAEs, will be evaluated according to the 
criteria specified in Section  9. The period of observation of AEs (and SAEs) extends from the 
time the subject provides signed informed consent until the s ubject completes the study , as 
specified in Section  9.4. Procedures for reporting AEs, and SAEs, are specified in Section  9.5 
and Section  9.6, respectively.  
Reporting of bleeding events and renal SAEs includes completion of the Bleeding Event 
eCRF page or the Renal SAE eCRF page, respectively, with supporting documentation 
(hospital records and tests). 
Before and at the end of each infusion conducted at the study site, the Investigator  or a 
medically qualified delegate will specifically inquire (via non -leading questioning) about any 
AEs that might have occurred since the last infusion conducted at the study site. All AEs (and 
SAEs and AEs of special interest) will be recorded on the AE pag e of the eCRF page.  
Each individual manifestation of an AE should be graded individually for severity (see Section 9.2). 
Details of the definitions and categorization of AEs, and procedures for the reporting of AEs, are available in Section  9.   
8.2.3.2 Vital Signs  
The Investigator or qualified delegate will take vital signs at screening, before the each 
infusion of investigational product, at the end of infusion of investigational product, and at any follow -up visits as specified in the Schedule of Assessments . Blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic) and pulse rate must be measured with the subject in a supine or seated position after resting for at least 5 minutes.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Blood pressure measurements should be taken from the same arm throughout the study us ing 
an automated blood pressure monitor that uses an oscillometric method. The same arm should 
not be used for blood sample collections and blood pressure assessments, if possible. At 
screening, blood pressure measurements may be repeated twice. If there i s a clinically 
significant change in blood pressure from the previous reading, measurements will be 
repeated immediately to confirm the change.  
Body temperature can be measured either orally or tympanically, but the method should be consistent throughout the study for a given subject. Height will be measured at Visit 1 only. 
8.2.3.3 Electrocardiograms 
A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed using local standard procedures. ECG intervals 
(eg, RR, PQ/PR, QRS, and uncorrected QT) will be measured. Clinically significant 
abnormal findings as determined by the Investigator  are to be recorded.  After the first 
infusion of investigational product, any new clinically significant abnormal findings should 
be recorded as AEs (see Section  9.5). 
8.2.3.4 Bleeding Events  
Assessment of any bleeding event s, including assessment of the infusion site for bruising, 
redness or swelling, will be performed at each visit after r andomization (including baseline), 
up to and including Visit 8. The event should be recorded as an AE (see Section 9.5) and 
assessed by using the BARC criteria as outlined in Appendix IV. The Bleeding Event eCRF  
page should also be completed along with  supporting source documents (hospital records and 
tests). 
8.2.3.5 Physical Examination 
The Investigator or a medically qualified delegate will perform a  physical examination 
covering the following body systems (h ead and neck, CV , respiratory, gastrointestinal ( GI), 
musculoskeletal, neurologic, and integumentary systems) during screening and at the end of 
the Active Treatment Period  as specified in the Schedule of Assessments . Clinically

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  significant abnormal findings at screening should be recorded as medical history. After the 
first infusion of investigational product, new clinically significant abnormal findings should 
be recorded as AEs (see Section  9.5). Physical examination findings should also include drug 
hypersensitivity reactions if relevant (see Sect ion 8.2.3.6). 
8.2.3.6 Drug Hypersensitivity Monitoring  
Drug hypersensitivity findings may include: allergic reactions, bronchospasm/wheezing, 
generalized rash, anaphylaxis, etc. In the event that a subject exper iences a hypersensitivity 
reaction during the infusion, the infusion is to be stopped immediately, and additional assessments are to be performed includ ing:   
• Blood samples for quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgE, and IgA)  and complete 
blood count with differential (Section 8.1.2, Table 4). Anti-IgA antibodies will be 
performed if clinically indicated  at the central laboratory . 
• The subject should be re-queried to confirm the absence of a history of allergy to soy or 
peanuts.  
• Pertinent positives and negatives should also be assessed and documented in the source document and eCRF including:  rash, swelling, hives, itching, wheezing, stridor, and 
involvement of the mucous membranes. 
• Relevant physical examination findings should also be documented ( eg, maculopapular 
rash, swelling of the face or oropharynx, etc.). 
8.2.3.7 Laboratory Procedures  
Details regarding laboratory procedures / assessments to be performed in this study are provided in the subsequent subsections. The local laboratory is to be used for all laboratory 
assessment s that must be reviewed in real time , ie, values taken to determine study eligibility 
and dosing decisions. All laboratory assessment samples should also be sent  to the 
central laboratory for analysis.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Clinical laboratory test results from the central and/or local laboratory that are outside the 
normal reference range and are deemed clinically significant by the Investigator are to be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs. If clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results are identified after investigational product infusion, the test(s) will be repeated until the abnormal 
values return to normal and/or baseline or stabilize  (Section 8.2.2.2). Safety parameters 
should be repeated if the specimen is hemolyzed. 
An abnormal laboratory value should be deemed clinically significant if any of the following 
conditions is met:  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity that is new or has worsened since baseline.  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management ( ie, change of dose), 
discontinuation of the study product, close observation, more frequent follow-up 
assessments or further diagnostic investigation. 
• If the Investigator is able to provide a differential diagnosis for the abnormal clinical 
laboratory result, the AE is to be recorded accordingly. In the absence of an associated 
clinical sign or symptom, and if only a sin gle laboratory value is deemed clinically 
significant, the abnormal laboratory value is to be recorded as the AE. 
Any laboratory test result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for an AE or and SAE should be 
reported as such  (see Section 9.5). 
8.2.3.7.1 Serum Biochemistry  
Sampling for serum biochemistry will be obtained for analysis by the central laboratory at 
time points listed in the Schedule of Assessments  and the values will be used for safety 
analysis (Table 4).  
Sampling for ALT, total bilirubin and serum creatinine should be obtained from the local 
laboratory to assess for eligibility and safety for administration  of investigational product. 
Results must be reviewed by the Investigator before infusions on Study Days 1, 8, 15, and 22

will be stored for up to 10 years after completion of the study, or for the duration 
permitted by national or local regulations,  and destroyed upon notification by the Steering 
Committee. These analyses may be used for future planning and / or exploratory analyses. 
No genotypic analysis wi ll be performed utilizing these samples.  
• The virology samples are taken for possible future assessment of currently unspecified viral agents. A minimum of 2 samples will be stored for up to 1 year after the completion 
of the clinical study report for possible virology testing. If testing is required, a separate 
protocol will be written by the sponsor and Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) approval for the protocol sought; upon 
IRB / IEC approval, impacted subjects would need to provide written informed consent 
before virology testing of their samples could be conducted. 
8.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPIES 
All drugs and / or procedures currently being administered to  a subject at the time of signing 
informed consent, and which continue to be taken in addition to investigational product 
during the study, are regarded as concomitant therapies  and must be documented as such in 
the eCRF.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  arrives at the hospital emergency department ( ie, door time) or cardiac catheterization 
laboratory, for evaluation and treatment of AMI. 
The following procedures will be conducted and documented at the screening visit: 
• Informed consent 
− All subjects must provide written informed consent before any study- specific 
assessments or procedures are performed. Written informed consent is not required 
for assessments or procedures per formed according to standard of care ( eg, for 
diagnosis or treat ment); results from such assessments may be used in the 
determination of study eligibility . 
• Medical history, including active medical conditions and medical or surgical history 
diagnosed within 3 months before the screening visit (including but not limited  to prior 
MI, diabetes mellitus, GI bleed, or any other clinically -significant bleeding event 
requiring transfusion of > 2 units P RBCs within the past 3 months). Specifically for 
history of CKD, evidence of CKD within the 6 months before admission for the index AMI should be obtained if possible (eg, prior serum creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, or 
suspected etiology of CKD). 
• Demography 
• Prior / concomitant medication  review  
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria (including relevant clinical laboratory tests and 
method of contraception) 
• Height (in cm)  
• Body weight (in kg) 
• 12-lead ECG  
• Physical examination (includes examination of head and neck, CV , respiratory, GI, 
musculoskeletal, neurologic and integumentary systems ; any abnormal findings should be 
recorded on the medical history eCRF )

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  • Vital signs  (blood pressure [supine or seated systolic and diastolic], pulse rate [after 
resting for 5 minutes] , and body temperature (oral or tympanic) 
• AE assessment  
• Urine pregnancy test  
− Required for all women of child-bearing potential.  
• FSH test by central laboratory (for amenorrheic females between the ages of 45 and 
60 years, to confirm post-menopausal status) 
• Serum biochemistry by central laboratory  
• ALT, total bilirubin,  and serum creatinine by local laboratory. These results must be 
reviewed by the Investigator to determine hepatic and renal function stability for study 
eligibility  (Section 8.2.2.1).  
• Urinalysis. At screening only, urinalysis will be locally performed  by urine dipstick. If 
dipstick demonstrates high grade proteinuria defined as ≥ 3+ (ie, ≥ 300 mg/dL) , a urine 
sample should be sent to the central laboratory for urinalysis. 
• Use IRT to assign the subject identification  number  
Subjects who complete all of these assessments and who fulfil the eligibility criteria (ie, 
eligible subjects) will be enrolled into the study.  
If the subject is not eligible for the study, the primary  reason for screen failure must be 
entered in the IRT system . 
Screening and randomization of subjects may occur on the same day ( Study Day 1 of Active 
Treatment Period ) provided that the minimum time  after FMC for the index AMI event or 
administration of IV contrast agent is adhered to for confirmation of renal function stability 
before administration of the first infusion of investigational product. If the first infusion of 
investigational product is to be administered on the same day that screening assessments were 
performed, the local laboratory test results obtained at screening may be used to assess for 
hepatic function testing within acceptable limits and  renal functi on stability if the criteria 
outlined in Section 8.2.1.2 are met .

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
The period of observation for AE s extends from the time the subject gives  informed consent 
until the end of study (see Section  9.4 for further details).  
Adverse event s may include: 
• Exacerbation ( ie, an increase in the fr equency or severity) of a pre-existing condition.  
Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history section of the 
eCRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of 
the condition during the study.  
• A clinical event occurring after consent but before investigational product administration.  
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of investigational product. 
Adverse events do not include: 
• Events identified at screening that meet exclusion criteria  
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE) 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place. For example:  
o Planned hospitalizations due to pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened. 
o Hospitalizations that occur for procedures not due to an AE ( eg, cosmetic surgery) . 
o Hospitalizations for a diagnostic procedure where the hospital stay is less than 
24 hours in duration or for normal management procedures ( eg, chemotherapy) . 
• Overdose of investigational product or any concomitant therapy that does not result in 
any adverse signs or symptoms.  
 
For laboratory safety parameters, any instances of absolute values being  outside the reference 
range or changes at any vi sit after study start  that are considered by the Investigator  as 
clinically significant must recorded in the eCRF  as AEs. In addition, at the Investigator ’s

Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 109 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  discretion, any changes or trends over time in laboratory parameters can be recorded in the 
eCRF as AEs if such changes or trends are considered to be clinically relevant, even if the 
absolute values are within the reference range.  
Laboratory findings do not need to be reported as AEs in the following cases: 
• Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at screening , unless a further 
increase/decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition .  
• Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by mechanical or physical influences on the blood sample ( eg, in vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by the laboratory in the 
laboratory report. 
• Abnormal parameters that are obviously biologically implausible ( eg, values that are 
incompatible with life  or outside the measuring range ). 
• An abnormal laboratory value that cannot be confirmed after re peat analysis, preferably 
in the same laboratory ( ie, the previous result could be marked as not valid and should not 
necessarily be reported as an AE).  
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in  death – The event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this serious 
criterion. 
• Is life-threatening  – The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  – 
CSLB considers “hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization” for at least 
24 hours as the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospital admissions for planned surgery or 
for normal disease management procedures ( eg, chemotherapy) are not considered as 
defining criteria for SAEs.

Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 110 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is medically significant  – A medically significant event is defined as an event that does 
not necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a physician to 
potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the above outcomes listed as an SAE criterion. 
Adverse events that do not fall into the above categories are defined as nonserious AEs. 
9.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following AEs are of special i nterest for which ongoing monitoring and/or expedited 
reporting by the Investigator is required as per Section 9.5.1: 
9.1.3.1 Stage 3 Acute Kidney Injury 
Acute kidney injury for this purpose will be defined as an elevation in serum creatinine 
during the Active Treatment Period  to ≥ 3 x the baseline value or a serum creatinine of 
≥ 4.0 mg/dL (353.6 μmol/L, Kidney Disease Improv ing Global Outcomes  [KDIGO] March 
2012) that is confirmed by repeat assessment by the central laboratory.  
9.1.3.2 Drug Hypersensitivity  
Drug hypersensitivity will be as assessed by the Investigator.  Assessments should be 
performed as described in Section 8.2.3.6. 
9.1.3.3 Potential Hy’s Law Case  
Potential Hy’s Law cases for this purpose will be defined as elevation in ALT > 3 x ULN 
with a concomitant increase in total bilirubin that is > 2 x ULN that is confirmed by repeat 
assessment by the central laboratory. AST is not being used in this definition since there may 
be increases in AST that are due to the index AMI event. Hy’s Law is defined as an elevation 
in AST or A LT > 3 x ULN with a concomitant increase in total bilirubin that is > 2 x ULN 
without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase), and with no other

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  reason found to explain the combination of these increased AST/ALT and total bilirubin 
findings ( Guidance for Industry: Drug- induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation 2009). Additional assessments should be performed as described in Section 8.2.2. 
9.1.3.4 Hemolysis  
Hemolysis will be defined as a decrease in hemoglobin during the Active Treatment Period  of 
≥ 2 g/dL from baseline that is not explained by overt blood loss. Additional assessments 
should be performed as described in Section  8.2.3.7.2.  
9.1.3.5 Bleeding Events  
Bleeding events will be assessed according to the BARC definition for bleeding (see 
Appendix IV). 
9.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
The severity of each AE  (ie, nonserious and serious AEs ) is to be assessed by the Investigator 
using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria f or Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) criteria as  follows: 
NCI Grade  Definition  
Grade 0 Grade 0 is universally defined as absence of AE or within normal limits or values.  
Grade 1 An AE that is asymptomatic; or involves mild or minor symptoms; or is of marginal 
clinical relevance; or consists of clinical or diagnostic observations alone; or for 
which intervention is not indicated; or for which only non- prescription intervention is 
indicated. 
Grade 2 An AE for which only minimal, local,  or noninvasive intervention ( eg, packing, 
cautery) is indicated; or that limits instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs, eg, 
shopping, laundry, transportation or ability to conduct finances). 
Grade 3 An AE that is medically significant but not life -threatening; or for which inpatient 
care or prolongation of hospitalization are indicated; or that is an important medical 
event that does not result in hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or m ay 
require intervention either to prevent hospitalization, to prevent the AE from becoming life- threatening or causing death; or that is disabling; or that results in 
persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or limitation of self-care activities o f

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  NCI Grade  Definition  
daily living (ADLs, eg, getting in and out of bed, dressing, eating, getting around 
inside, bathing, or using the toilet).  
Grade 4 An AE that has life -threatening consequences; for which urgent intervention is 
indicated; that puts the patient at risk of  death at the time of the event if immediate 
intervention is not undertaken; or that causes blindness or deafness.  
Grade 5 The termination of life as a result of an AE.  
ADLs = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event ; NCI = National Cancer Institu te 
Note: Definitions provided here correspond to: NCI Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events V4.0 .  
 
If an AE is reported that is not part of the CTCAE criteria, the following criteria will be 
used:  
Severity Definition  
Mild A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual ADLs. 
Moderate A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual ADLs, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe A type of AE that interrupts usua l ADLs, or significantly affects clinical status, or 
may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
ADLs = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event  
Note: definitions are based on the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data 
Tabulation Model (SDTM)  Severity Intensity Scale for Adverse Event Terminology  
 
9.3 CAUSALITY OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
The causal relationship of an AE to investigational product must always be assessed by the 
Investigator. All AEs will be classified as either related or not related  to investigational 
product. If a causality assessment is not provided  for an AE (including an SAE ) that AE will 
be considered related to investigational product.  
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to investigatio nal product or an 
alternative cause ( eg, natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be 
determined by how well the event can be understood in terms of: 
• Known pharmacology of investigational product. 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 113 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  • Clinically and  / or pathophysiol ogically plausible context.  
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the 
literature for similar products as being product related (eg, headache, facial flushing, 
pallor). 
• Plausibility support ed by the temporal relationship ( eg, the event being related by time to 
administration or termination of treatment with investigational product, drug withdrawal 
or reproduced on rechallenge). 
9.4 OBSERVATION PERIOD FOR ADVERSE EVENTS 
The observation period for AE (and SAE) reporting in an individual subject will start at the 
time of giving written informed consent for participation in the current study and finish with 
the end of study visit (Visit 8).   
If the Investigator becomes awar e of an SAE that has started after the observation period has 
finished, and there is at least a possible causal relationship to  investigational product, the 
event must be reported to CSLB (see Section 9.6). 
9.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
At each clinical evaluation, the Investigator (or medically -qualified delegate) will determine 
whether any AEs have occurred. Adverse events will be recorded in the AE page of the 
eCRF. If known, the medical diagnosis of an AE should be recorded in preference to the 
listing of individual signs and symptoms. T he Investigator  must follow up on the course of an 
AE until resolution  or stabilization . If an AE is ongoing after the end of study visit, the AE 
will continue to be followed up until resolution, stabilization . 
If, during the study period, a subject presents with a preexisting condition that was not noted at the time of study entry, the condition should be retrospectively recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF. 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 114 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  For AE reporting, the study period is defined as that time period from the signature of the 
informed consent form (ICF) through Visit 8 . Therefore, events that occur before the initial 
screening visit will be recorded in the medical history and events that occur after the signing of the ICF will be recorded as an AE.  
9.5.1 Adverse Events of Special Interes t 
9.5.1.1 Stage 3 Acute Kidney Injury 
Any elevation in serum creatinine of  ≥ 3 x the baseline value or a serum creatinine of ≥ 4.0 mg/dL ( 353.6 μmol/L) that is confirmed by repeat assessment by the central laboratory 
should be reported as an SAE as described in Section 9.6. In addition, the increased value should be confirmed by repeat assessment by the central laboratory and followed until 
resolution or stabilization.  
9.5.1.2 Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction  
If a drug hypersensitivity reaction is susp ected, it should be reported as an AE as described in 
Section 9.1. Assessments should be performed as described in Section 8.2.3.6. 
9.5.1.3 Potential Hy’s L aw Case 
An elevation in ALT > 3 x ULN with a concomitant  increase in total bilirubin that is 
> 2 x ULN should be should be reported as an SAE as described in Section 9.6 as this could 
be an indicator of a potential Hy’s Law case. See Section 9.1.3.3 for definition of Hy’s Law.  
Additional assessments should be performed as described in Section 8.2.2. 
9.5.1.4 Hemolysis  
Hemolysis as defined in Section 9.1.3 should be reported as an AE as described in 
Section 9.1. Additional assessments should be performed as described in Section 8.2.3.7.2.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  9.5.1.5 Bleeding Events  
Bleeding events should be reported as AEs (see Sections 3.6.4 and  9.1) and the Bleeding 
Event eCRF page must be completed for each suspected bleeding event. 
9.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full 
requirements of ICH Topic E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting). 
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study, whether or not causally related to 
the investigational product, must be reported  and entered into the eCRF immediately 
(within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event ). 
Adverse events occurring in the period between the time that the subject gave written 
informed consent and the first exposure to investigational product that meet 1 or more of the 
seriousness criteria for AEs must be entered immediately (within 24 hours of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the event) in the clinical study database in the same manner as other 
SAEs.  
Any SAE that occurs after the end of study visit that is considered to be causally related to 
investigational pr oduct must be immediately (ie , within 24 hours of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the event) reported to the sponsor . 
If access to the clinical database is not available (eg, system or internet access problem , or the 
clinical study database is locked), a handwritten SAE report must be completed, signed and 
dated by the Investigator and sent to CSLB G lobal Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance via 
facsimile or email.  
If and/or when the system becomes available post outage, the SAE must be entered in to the 
clinical study database immediately .

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  9.6.1 Requirements for Immediate Reporting of S erious Adverse Event s 
The minimum reporting requirements for immediate entry of SAEs in the eCRF include: 
• Identifiable subject.  
• Suspected medicinal product and / or procedur e. 
• Event term . 
• Identifiable reporting source.  
In addition, the Investigator must:  
• Report all SAEs to the relevant IRB / IEC within the timeframe  specified by the 
IRB / IEC. 
• Enter relevant follow-up information in the eCRF until the SAE has resolved, or, in the 
case of permanent impairment, until stabilized.  
• Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF.  
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled , the Investigator should not wait to 
receive additional information to fully document the event before entering the information 
into the clinical study database .  
When submitting SAE reports and any other related reports ( eg, discharge summaries) to 
CSLB, subjects should be identified only by their  subject number and study number. The 
Investigator should not include the subject’s name, date of birth, or address. 
In cases of death, the Investigator  should supply CSL B and the IRB / IEC (as applicable) 
with any additional information as it becomes available ( eg, autopsy reports). When 
submitting medical reports to CSL B, the subject should be identified only by their subject 
identification  number and study number. 
The procedure to be followed if an ongoing AE becomes an SAE after the end of the 
observation period for AEs is described in Section  9.9.

Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 117 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  9.7 OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENT REPORTING  
9.7.1 Overdose  
Details (ie , volume, location of infusions, infusion rate) of overdose of investigational 
product or any concomitant therapy must be recorded in the eCRF. Any overdose that is 
considered by the Investigator to be medically significant (ie, occurs in association with an 
event and meets any seriousness criteria) must be entered as an SAE ( see Section  9.5.1). An 
overdose that does not result in any adverse signs or symptoms should not be considered an 
AE (see Section  9.1.1). 
9.7.2 Pregnancy and Lactation  
A female subject or female partner of a male subject who becomes pregnant while 
participating in the study, or up to and including 3 months  after the last dose of  
investigational product , must notify the Investigator immediately.    
If a female subject beco mes pregnant, she must discontinue treatment with investigational 
product, but may continue other study procedures at the discretion of the Investigator . If the 
female subject is in the Active Treatment Period  of the study, her participation will be 
discontinued and the procedure for discontinuation of a subject will be followed, as described in Section  4.1.4). Every effort will be made to ensure that the relevant safety assessments for 
early termination  Visit 7 are completed (telephone documentation is allowed). 
CSLB must be notified within 5 days of the Investigator  becoming aware of the pregnancy.  
Whenever p ossible, a pregnancy in a subject or in a female partner of a male subject exposed 
to investigational product should be followed to term so as to assess any potential occurrence 
of congenital anomalies or birth defects. Any follow-up information, including premature 
termination and the status of the mother and child after delivery, should be reported by the 
Investigator to CSL B using a Pregnancy Reporting / Outcome Form.  
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 118 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as an SAE ( eg, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death or congenital anomaly) then the Investigator 
should follow the procedure for reporting an SAE (Section 9.6.1).   
9.8 INSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW BOARD / INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMIT TEE 
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
The time frame within which an IRB / IEC  must be notified of deaths and investigational 
product-related unexpected SAEs is stipulated by each IRB  / IEC. It is the Investigator ’s 
responsibility to comply with the requirements for IRB / IEC notification. CSLB will provide 
Investigator s with all details of all SAEs reported to regulatory authorities. 
9.9 FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Every effort should be made to follow-up subjects who continue to experience an AE, AE of special interest,  or an SAE on completion of the study until either  the AE resolves or 
stabilizes. All follow -up information (and attempted follow-up contacts) should be 
documented in the subject’s medical records. Relevant details of the subject’s progress 
should also be entered in the eCRF . 
10. STATISTICS  
10.1 SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION  
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, multi-dose safety study in subjects with moderate 
RI and AMI. Subjects are to be randomized to CSL112 or placebo treatment in a 2:1 ratio. The co-primary endpoint s are: 
• Renal SAEs (defined as any SAE with  a MedDRA PT included in the Acute Renal 
Failure narrow SMQ or a PT of renal tubular necrosis, renal cortical necrosis, renal 
necrosis, or renal papillary necrosis), and  
• AKI, defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL  
(26.5 μmol /L) during the Active Treatment Period  that is sustained upon repeat

Final V2.0  6 June 2016  Page 119 of 137 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  measurement by the central laboratory no earlier than 24 hours after the elevated value. If 
no repeat value is obtained [due, for example, to loss of follow-up or protocol violation], 
a single serum creatinine value that is increased from baseline ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) 
during the Active Treatment Period would also fulfil the definition of AKI. Baseline for 
determination of AKI is defined as the pre-infusion central laboratory serum creatinine level on Study Day 1.  
With a sample size of 81 (54 active: 27 placebo), the study will detect with 80% probability a treatment -emergent event with a frequency of 3% in the active group and 2 % overall. A total 
of 81 subjects, 27 placebo and 54 CSL112, is planned for this study to meet regulatory considerations for treatment -emergent renal event characterization ; it is not powered for 
statistical testing of the co-primary endpoints.  
10.2 STUDY POPULATIONS  
10.2.1 Screened  Population 
The Screened  Population will comprise all subjects who provided written informed consent to 
undergo study screening procedures.   
10.2.2 Intent-to-Treat Population  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will comprise all subjects in the Screened Population 
who were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups. This population will be analyzed using 
the treatment to which the subject was randomized regardless of the treatment actually 
received.  
10.2.3 Safety Population 
The Safety Population will comprise all subjects in the ITT Population who received at least 
a partial dose of investigational product , and will be based on the actual treatment received .

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  of interest; eg, a subject with 2 treatment -emergent renal SAEs will be counted once. 
Baseline for determination of AKI is defined as the pre-infusion central laboratory serum 
creatinine level from Study Day 1. Acute kidney injury events will be identified using central 
laboratory results. Treatment -emergent is defined as occurring at or after the start of the first 
infusion. Th e difference in incidence rates will be computed by subtracting the rate in the 
placebo arm from the incidence rate in the CSL112 arm so that a positive difference indicates 
a higher incidence rate in the CSL112 arm. For each co -primary endpoint, Newcombe-
Wilson 2-sided 95% confidence intervals around the difference in incidence rates will be calculated if at least 1 event occurs. Otherwise, an exact, 1-sided, upper 97.5% confidence 
interval will be reported for the incidence rate in each treatment arm.  
A sensitivity analysis of  the renal SAE  co-primary endpoint will use independently 
adjudicated results and the same methods as the primary study analysis.  A sensitivity analysis 
of the AKI co -primary endpoint will use local laboratory results and the same methods as the 
primary study analysis.  
Acute kidney injury rates will be compared among subjects whose dosing eligibility was 
determined in part based on serum creatinine determinations performed 12 to 24 hours after 
radiographic contrast exposure versus those whose dosing eligibility was determined in part 
based on serum creatinine determinations performed 48± 6 hours after radiographic contrast 
exposure. If data on subjects with serum creatinine determinations performed 12 to 24 hours after radiographic contrast are insufficient to perform this analysis, an analysis comparing the 
AKI rates among subjects whose dosing eligibility was determined in part based on serum creatinine determinations performed 12 to 48 hours after radiographic contras t exposure 
versus those whose dosing eligibility was determined in part based on serum creatinine determinations performed > 48 hours after radiographic contrast exposure will be performed . 
For either analysis, the difference in placebo -corrected rates between the 2  time-period 
subgroups will be calculated, along with a 2-sided 95% confidence interval. 
All primary endpoint analyses will use the Safety population.

Before a site enrolls subjects, the Study Monitor will conduct a Site Initiation Visit. The 
purpose of the Site Initiation Visit is to provide the staff with training on the following:  
• Study protocol procedures to ensure high quality and consistent data collection 
• Maintenance of the Investigator  site files 
• Responsibilities of site staff and Investigators, under ICH GCP, to ensure that the rights 
and well-being of subjects are protected. 
Representatives of the sponsor will visit all study sites periodically to assess the data quality, 
site conduct and study integrity. On site, they will review study data and directly compare 
them with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the Investigator , and 
verify that the facilities remain acceptable. Further information regarding data quality assurance is found in Section 13.5.2. 
The study may be subject to an audit by CSLB, an authorized representative(s) of CSLB, 
and/or inspections by an authorized regulatory authority ( eg, US Food and D rug 
Administration [FDA] ). Regulatory authorities may request access to all study 
documentation, including source documents for inspection and copying, in keeping with local 
regulations. CSLB will immediately notify the Investigator  of an upcoming audit / inspection. 
In the event of an audit, all pertinent study- related documentation must be made available to 
the auditor(s). If an audit or inspection occurs, the Investigator at each study site will permit 
the auditor / inspector direct access to all relevant documents and allocate their time as well as the time of relevant staff to discuss the findings and any relevant issues.

 Appendix III:  Killip Classification  
 
• Killip class I  includes individuals with no clinical signs of heart failure . 
• Killip class II  includes individuals with rales or crackles in the lungs , an S3 heart 
sound, and elevated jugular venous pressure. 
• Killip class III  describes individuals with frank pulmonary edema . 
• Killip class IV  describes individuals in cardiogenic shock or hypotension (measured 
as systolic blood pressure  lower than 90 mmHg), and evidence of peripheral 
vasoconstriction ( oliguria, cyanosis  or sweating).

 Appendix IV: Assessment of Bleeding Events by Bleeding Academic 
Research Consortium (BARC) Definition for Bleeding  
Type 0: no bleeding  
Type 1: bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek unscheduled performance of 
studies, hospitalization, o r treatment by a healthcare professional; may include episodes leading to self -
discontinuation of medical therapy by the patient without consulting a healthcare professional  
Type 2: any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage ( eg, more bleeding than would be expected for a clinical 
circumstance, including bleeding found by imaging alone) that does not fit the criteria for type 3, 4, or 5 but 
does meet at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) requiring nonsurgical, medical interve ntion by a healthcare 
professional, (2) leading to hospitalization or increased level of care, or (3) prompting evaluation  
Type 3 
Type 3a  
• Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to < 5 g/ dLa (provided hemoglobin drop is related to 
bleed)  
• Any transfusion with overt bleeding  
Type 3b  
• Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop ≥ 5 g/dLa (provided hemoglobin drop is related to 
bleed)  
• Cardiac tamponade  
• Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid)  
• Bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive agents  
Type 3c  
• Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include microbleeds or hemorrhagic transformation, does 
include intraspinal)  
Subcategories confirmed by autopsy or imaging or lumbar puncture  
• Intraocular bleed compromising vision  
Type 4: CABG -related bleeding : 
• Perioperative intracranial bleeding within 48 h  
• Reoperation after closure of sternotomy for the purpose of controlling bleeding  
• Transfusion of ≥5 U whole blood or PRBCs within a 48 -h periodb  
• Chest tub e output ≥2L within a 24 -h period 
Type 5: fatal bleeding  
Type 5a  
Probable fatal bleeding; no autopsy or imaging confirmation but clinically suspicious  
Type 5b  
Definite fatal bleeding; overt bleeding or autopsy or imaging confirmation  
CABG = coronary artery bypass graft  h = hour; PRBCs = packed red blood cells   
a. Corrected for transfusion (1 U PRBCs or 1 U whole blood = 1 g/dL hemoglobin).  
b. Cell saver products are not counted.  
NOTE: Platelet transfusions should be recorded and reported but are not included in these definitions until 
further information is obtained about the relationship to outcomes.   If a CABG -related bleed is not adjudicated 
as at least a type 3 severity event, it will be classified as not a bleeding event. If a bleeding event occu rs with a 
clear temporal relationship to CABG ( ie, within a 48 -h time frame) but does not meet type 4 severity criteria, it 
will be classified as not a bleeding event.

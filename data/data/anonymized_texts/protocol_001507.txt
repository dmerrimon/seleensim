Estimated date last patient completed:  December 2023  Phase of Development:  
Phase 3  
Objectives:  
Efficacy Objective:  
• Determine the effects of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), compared with placebo, on biomarkers 
and clinical symptoms of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) in adult patients with CTX.  
Safety Objective:  
• Assess the safety and tolerability  of CDCA in adult and pediatric patients.  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• Characterize the relationship among biomarkers in adult and pediatric patients.  
• Characterize steady -state pharmacokinetics (PK) of CDCA and 2 conjugated forms of CDCA, 
GlycoChenodeoxycholic Acid (gCDCA) and TauroChenodeoxycholic Acid (tCDCA) in adult 
patients.  
• Characterize the relationship between dose and PK concentration among pediatric patients.  
• Assess biomarkers and health status among pediatric patients treated with CDCA.  
Methodology:  
This study is made up of 2 designs: a randomized, double -blind (DB), crossover study design among 
patients ≥16 years of age at Screening (adult cohort) and an open -label (OL), dose-titration, and 
maintenance study design among pediatric patie nts ≥1 month and <16 years of age at Screening 
(pediatric cohort).

Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
Confidential and Proprietary  6 4-Week DB1:  On Day 1, patients will be randomized to treatment sequence AB or BA. Patients
randomized to sequence AB will receive blinded 250 mg CDCA TID for 4  weeks or until rescue
medication criteria are triggered; patients randomized to sequence BA will receive placebo TID for
4 weeks or until rescue medication criteria are triggered. Should rescue medication criteria be met,
patients will receive 250  mg CDCA TID until the end of DB1. Patients will return to the clinic on
Day 8 and weekly thereafter for the remaining 3  weeks.
8-Week OL2:  Upon completion of DB1, patients will receive open-label 250 mg CDCA TID for
8 weeks and return to the clinic for biweekly scheduled visits.
4-Week DB2:  At Week  12, patients who were randomized to sequence AB will crossover into DB2
and receive placebo treatment TID for 4  weeks or until rescue medication criteria are triggered;
patients who were randomized to sequence BA will receive blinded 250 mg CDCA TID treatment for4 weeks or until the rescue medication criteria are triggered. Should rescue medication criteria be met,
patients will receive 250 mg CDCA TID until the end of DB2. Patients will return to the clinic onDay 92 (7 days after the first day of the DB2 period), and weekly thereafter for the remaining 3 weeks.
Rescue Medication Criteria in the Adult Cohort: 
Blinded or open-label 250 mg CDCA TID rescue medication will be provided during the DB periods, 
if needed, based on blinded biomarkers (blinded rescue) and/or clinical CTX -related symp toms 
(open-label rescue). Patients who require blinded and/or open -label CDCA rescue medication in a 
given period will remain on the rescue medication for the remainder of the respective DB period. Patients who require rescue medication during DB1 but otherwise remain eligible should continue to OL2 and then to DB2.  
Blinded CDCA will be provided to patients who meet the following criterion: increase of 10 times the baseline value for a given period (ie, Visits 6 and 14) in urine 23S -pentol. Blinded CDCA will be 
assigned through the Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IxRS) at the next scheduled in -clinic 
visit. The Investigator and patient will remain blinded to biomarker data, treatment assignment, and if blinded rescue medication criteria are met.  
Patients receiving either blinded CDCA or blinded placebo during the DB period will be rescued with 
open-label CDCA at the discretion of the Investigator if they present with new or worsening 
CTX-related symptoms relative to their respective pretreatment assessments as defined in the protocol. The Investigator is responsible for evaluating patients to determine if they meet the criteria for rescue medication at each follow-up visit during DB1 and DB2 ( Appendix 1 ). 
Extension of an Open-Label Period as a Result of COVID-19:  
An adult cohort patient’s participation in an OL period (ie, OL1 or OL2) may be extended to delay the start of a DB withdrawal peri od (ie, DB1 or DB2) if study and/or site operations are disrupted as a 
result of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The decision to postpone the start of a DB period will be at the discretion of both the Investigator and Medical Monitor. If it is decided to extend an OL period, the patient will return to the study site once a month from the Visit 4 (OL1) or 
Visit 12 (OL2) date or last dispensation of OL study medication during the respective OL period. 
During these extension visits, the Investigator will ensure patient safety monitoring and dispensation of additional OL study medication is performed. Efficacy assessments during the extension visits are optional. See Appendix 6  for the Schedule of Assessments.  
Patients will continue to receive 250 mg open-label CDCA TID during the extension periods. Details 
within the clinical study protocol regarding study medication in the OL1 and OL2 per iods are 
applicable for the extension periods. A patient's total duration on treatment may extend beyond 
24 weeks if an extension visit is required because of COVID-19.  
A patient may proceed with the start of a DB withdrawal period when the Investigator and Medical Monitor agree that the impact to site and/or study operations because of COVID -19 has stabilized. The 
Investigator and Medical Monitor will consider the site’s ability to perform study visits without 
7

Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  7 interruption and the timely reporting of neces sary study results. A patient will resume the patient 
schedule as detailed in Appendix 1  when starting a DB period.  
If a patient completes 2 or more extension visits in 1 OL period, the patient must complete a study 
Visit  2 weeks prior to the start of a DB period to complete all safety and efficacy assessments that were 
otherwise required during a visit in the OL period.  
Visits at an alternative site by a trained medical professional (eg, licensed nurse) will be permitted to reduce the travel burden for patients. The visits that qualify for being conducted at an alternative site by a home health vendor are indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  (Appendix 6 ). 
Study Design Diagram for Extension of Open -Label Period in the Adult Cohort:  
 
PEDIATRIC COHORT : 
Pediatric cohort patients (≥1 month and <16 years at Screening) will participate in a 24 -week , 
open-label cohort with an 8 -week titration period to identify a safe and tolerable dose and a 16 -week 
treatment period at the safe and tolerated dose as maintenance. Patients will be screened at Visit 1 (Appendix 2 ) and those who satisfy all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
eligible to participate in this cohort to evaluate safety, PK, and biomarkers in this population. Patients will have visits every week during the titration period and every 4 weeks during the treatment period.  
During the dose -titration period, dose escalation  decisions will be based on safety and tolerability 
(Section  6.5.1 ). 
Dosing will be as follows:  
• Treatment -naïve pediatric cohort patients will receive doses of 5 mg/kg/day (TID), 10  mg/kg/day 
(TID), or 15  mg/kg/day (TID) titrated up every 2 weeks based on safety and tolerability over a 
period of 8 weeks.  
• Treatment -experienced pediatric cohort patients currently taking a dose ≥5 mg/kg/day of CDCA 
will start at their current dose and titrate up every 2 weeks to the next dose level up to 
15 mg/kg/day based on safety and tolerability over a period of 8 weeks. Patients with a history 
demonstrating intolerance at higher doses will not be required to dose escalate.  
• Pediatric dosing of CDCA will not exceed an equivalent dose of 750 mg/day.  
• Pediatric cohort patients who are able to take an equivalent weight -based dose of 750 mg/day and 
are capable of swallowing a tablet will have the option to dose with CDCA 250 mg tablets TID or the liquid suspension form of CDCA.

Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  9 treatment -naïve patients, serum cholestanol and urine 23 S-pentol levels will be obtained prior 
to initiating open-label CDCA.  
4. If the patient is currently being treated with CDCA at a dose different than the 
protocol -specified dose, the patient must be willing to change his or her current dose.  
5. With Medical Mon itor approval, patients currently taking CDCA and riluzole for the treatment 
of ataxia are eligible, provided their ataxia is well controlled and they have been on a stable 
dose of riluzole for a minimum of 6 months.  
6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) , beginning at menarche, must agree to the use of 
1 highly reliable (ie, can achieve a failure rate of <1% per year) method of contraception 
during the course of the study. Highly reliable contraception methods include stable oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected contraceptive hormones associated with inhibition of ovulation, or an intrauterine device (IUD) in place for at least 3 months. One additional barrier method must also be used during sexual activity, such as a diaphragm with spermicide or male 
partner’s use of male condom with spermicide, during the course of the study. WOCBP are 
defined as those who are fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile; permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy,  bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as amenorrhea for more than 24 consecutive months without an alternative medical cause; women on 
hormone replacement therapy must have a documented plasma follicle -stim ulating hormone 
level >40  mIU/mL. All WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening. 
NOTE: Prior to menarche, pregnancy testing and contraceptive use is not required. However, the patient and their parent/legal guardian must be advised that,  immediately upon menarche, 
the patient will be required to begin pregnancy testing and initiate contraceptive use. This requirement cannot be avoided.  
7. Males must be surgically sterile (more than 3 months post -vasectomy) or males and their 
sexual partners must together agree to the use of medically accepted methods of contraception that are considered highly reliable during the course of the study.  
8. The patient and/or his/her parent/legal guardian is willing and able to comply with the 
protocol.

device within 30 days prior to Screening.  
9. The patient has other prior or ongoing medical conditions, physical findings, or laboratory 
abnormalities that, in the Investigator’s opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the patient, 
make it unlikely that the course of treatment or follow up would be completed, or impair the assessment of study results.  
10. The patient has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past year that, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, could affect participation in or adherence to the requirements of the study.  
11. The patient has a positive serologic test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis C, or 
human immunodeficiency virus at Screening.  
12. The patient and/or his/her parent/legal guardian, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable to adhere to the requirements of the study.  
Inclusion Criteria Pre -Randomization for the Adult Cohort:  
Patients in the adult cohort who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for 
participation into the run-in period AND 
1. Tolerate CDCA treatment, in the judgment of the Investigator.  
2. Have not developed any condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, warrants discontinuation of CDCA.  
Patients who fail screening may be rescreened as needed. 
Study Medication, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
Adult cohort patients (≥16 years): CDCA tablets, 250  mg TID, oral  
Pediatric cohort patients (≥1 month and <16 years): CDCA tablets  will be carefully crushed by the 
pharmacist, added to a sodium bicarbonate solution 8.4% (1 mmol/mL) to create a 10 mg/mL liquid 
suspension (ie, one 250  mg tablet per 25  mL) and supplied for oral administration.  Patients who are 
able to take an equivalent weight -based dose of 750 mg/day and are capable of swallowing a tablet will 
have the option to take CDCA 250 mg tablets TID or the liquid suspension form of CDCA.  
Doses will be 5 mg/kg/day (TID), 10 mg/kg/day (TID), and 15  mg/kg/day (TID) depending upon t he 
safe and tolerated titrated dose.  
• Treatment -naïve pediatric cohort patients will receive doses of 5 mg/kg/day (TID), 10  mg/kg/day 
(TID), or 15 mg/kg/day (TID) titrated up every 2 weeks based on safety and tolerability over a 
period of 8 weeks.  
• Treatmen t-experienced pediatric cohort patients currently taking a dose ≥5 mg/kg/day of CDCA 
will start at their current dose and titrate up every 2 weeks to the next dose level up to 15 mg/kg/day based on safety and tolerability over a period of 8 weeks. Patients  with a history 
demonstrating intolerance at higher doses will not be required to dose escalate. Pediatric dosing of CDCA will not exceed an equivalent dose of 750 mg/day.
 
Patients currently taking Chenodal® and/or an alternative therapy for CTX are required to stop their 
medication/therapy prior to the start of study medication in OL1 for the adult cohort or the titration

Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  11 period for the pediatric cohort. Patients may resume or start taking Chenodal® and/or an alternative 
therapy for CTX after completing the study (ie, EOS visit) or permanently discontinuing study 
medication.  
Duration of Study:  
The adult cohort will be approximately 24 to 28 weeks in duration, including an up to 4-week 
screening period; an 8-week, open -label run -in period (OL1); two 4 -week,  DB treatment periods (DB1 
and DB2); and an 8-week open -label treatment period (OL2) in between DB1 and DB2. The duration 
of the adult cohort may extend beyond 28 weeks if the start of a double -blind period is delayed due to 
COVID-19.  
The pediatric cohort will be approximately 24 to 28 weeks in duration, including an up to 4-week screening period; an 8-week, open -label dose-titration period; and a 16-week, open-label treatment 
period at the identified safe and tolerated dose as maintenance.  
If genetic results are still pending after 28 days, the screening window for both cohorts may be 
extended up to 2 additional weeks, with approval by the Medical Monitor, which will bring the 
maximum total duration of the study to 30 weeks.  
For both cohorts, a  safety follow-up phone call will be conducted 30 (±7) days after the last dose of 
study medication.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
CDCA will be compared with placebo in the adult cohort. There is no reference therapy.

• Change in developmental milestones  
 
Statistical Methods: 
Descriptive statistics will be produced separately for adult and pediatric cohorts. The following 
sections describe inferential statistical testing procedures for efficacy endpoints collected during the double -blind period among adult cohort patients.  
Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints: 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint of change from baseline in log e-transformed urine 
23S-pentol at the end of each DB treatment period will be conducted via a paired t -test comparing 
CDCA with placebo using the Full A nalysis Set (FAS; adult cohort). Log -transformation is performed 
due to the anticipated wide range of urine 23S -pentol levels among CTX patients. Urine 23S -pentol 
will be determined using first morning void urine samples and will be calculated as the geome tric mean 
of 3 first morning void urine samples collected within 5 days prior to each visit at which urine 
23S-pentol is assessed. The baseline value for the first double -blind period is the measurement taken 
13
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  13 for Day 1; the baseline value for the second do uble-blind period is the measurement taken at Day  85 at 
the beginning of the second double -blind period. Measurements obtained after initiation of rescue 
medication will be considered “missing” for purposes of the primary analysis. An appropriate multiple 
imputation method will be used to impute missing values and the values after initiating rescue 
medication, under the assumption of missing at random. The imputed values, not the actual values 
obtained after the initiation of the rescue medication, will be used in the analysis. Further information on imputation of missing data methods and sensitivity analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Percent change from baseline in plasma cholestanol levels, and plasma 7αC4 and 7α12αC4 levels  at the end of each DB treatment period will be analyzed in a similar way as for the 
primary endpoint.  
The proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment and the corresponding exact 95% confidence interval (CI) will be presented for each treatment. Patients who require blinded and/or open-label CDCA during the DB periods will be considered to have met the event (ie, received rescue medication) for the primary analysis. The difference in proportions, the corresponding exact CI, and exact p -values 
will be  calculated and presented using Prescott's method ( Prescott  1981). This analysis will be 
performed on the FAS.  
Other continuous efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the same approach described for the primary endpoint. Other binary efficacy endpoints (such as incidence of new or worsening in CTX-related clinical manifestations) will be analyzed using the same approach described for the proportion of pat ients requiring rescue treatment. 
Control of Type 1 Error  
The primary endpoint of urine 23S -pentol will be tested at the final analysis at an α = 0.05. If the test is 
significant, the Family One is rejected and the entire α = 0.05 is preserved and then pas sed onto Family 
Two of hypotheses (ie, key secondary endpoints) for testing at the final analysis. Otherwise, there is no remaining α to be passed onto Family Two, and therefore, the key secondary endpoints will not be formally tested, and nominal p -values will be reported instead.  
Analysis of Safety Endpoints:  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the safety data by randomized treatment group among adult cohort patients based on the safety analysis set (SAS) and by administered dose among pediat ric 
cohort patients based on the pediatric safety analysis set (PSAS).  
Clinical laboratory parameters will be measured at baseline and postbaseline visits. Each continuous 
laboratory variable will be summarized in terms of changes from baseline by treatmen t group. 
Laboratory data will also be classified as low, normal, or high relative to the parameter’s reference 
range. Laboratory abnormalities for each treatment will also be summarized using shift tables.  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary fo r Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary by 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term. AEs that begin after the first administration of study 
medication, or existing AEs that worsen after the first dose of study medication, are considered TEAEs. 
The number and percentage of patients reporting TEAEs will be summarized for each treatment group 
by MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term, by severity, and by relationship to study medication. The number and percentage of patients reporting serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and AEOIs will also be summarized for each treatment group by MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term.  
Sample Size Justification for Adult Cohort:  
The hypothesis to be tested is H
0: Δ = 0 against H a: Δ ≠ 0, where Δ is the true paired treatment 
difference between CDCA and placebo for the change from baseline in log e-transformed urine 
23S-pentol. The planned sample size is expected to provide at least 90% power at the final analysis 
(approximately 12 patients; 2-s ided nominal α = 0.0436).  
14
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
Confidential and Proprietary  14 For the proportion of patients requiring rescue medication (secondary endpoint), the planned sample 
size of approximately 12 patients at the final analysis is expected to provide at least 85% power with 
two sided nominal α = 0.04 36. This assumes that 85% of patients (approximately 10/12) on placebo 
and 15% of patients (approximately 2/12) on CDCA will need rescue treatment, with a discordance of 80%, based on McNemar’s test.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosi
s (CTX) is an inborn metabolic disorder of bile acid synthesis 
caused by  a single enzym e defect
 (SED) (sterol 27- hydroxyla se). To date, only a few hundr ed 
patients with CTX have been identified, but the exact prevalence of CTX is unknow n 
(DeBarber 2014b). Clinical manifestations  of CTX oc cur in multiple o rgan s yste ms (including  
enterohepatic, te
ndon, ocula
r, and peripheral and central nervous systems) with th e onset of 
neurologic impairment in the second and third decades of life and early death i n the fifth or sixth 
decades of lif
e if the condition goes undiagnosed ( Duell 2018 ; Salen 1975 ; Salen 1987 ; 
Salen 
2017; Berginer 1984). 
CTX is caused by mutations in the cytochrome P450 C YP27A1 gene that result in production of 
a defective sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme (Salen 2017) . This enzyme is critical for  the synthesis 
of bile acids, including chenodeoxycholi
c acid (CDCA). This deficienc y leads to a virtual 
absence (<5%) of CDC
A in bile ( Shefer 1975 ), resulti ng in an increase in the production of 
atypical bile acids, bile alcohols (including urine 23S-pentol), and cholestanol. 
CTX is associated with elevated levels of cholestanol in the blood and deposition of cholestanol 
and cholesterol in the brain, te ndon xanthomas , and bi le (Salen 2017) ; these abnormalities 
repr
esent t
he primary mechanisms for many of the neurological and motor symptom s associate d 
with t he disease ( Keren 2009). 
There is a s ignifi
cant unmet need in CTX in tha t currently there is no  labeled me dication  that is 
indicated fo r trea
tment of  CTX. Over the past 35 years, t he understanding of the pathophysiology 
of CTX has led to the use of CDC A as a direct replacement therapy option. Exogenous 
administration of CDCA restores the physiologic bile acid pool and provides the necessary 
feedbac k to reduce the produc tion of cholestanol and bile alcohols, potentially altering  the rate of 
disease p rogression  (Berginer 2009 ; Price Eva
ns 2007;  Yahalom 2013 ). 
Although Chenodal® (chenodiol) is the standar d of care (SoC) in the United S tates (U S) for 
CTX, it has not  received ma rketing  approval for treatment o f CTX but  is currently s upplied 
under medic
al necessit y (Abbre
viated New Drug Application [ANDA] 091019). The chemical 
name for chenodiol is 3α, 7α -dihydroxy- 5β-cholan -24-oic acid (C 24H40O4). Additional 
informati on on the st
udy medicati on and nonclinica l studies conducted for the approval of 
C
henix (chenodeoxycholic acid), now markete d under the proprietary name Xenbilox, f or the  
treatment of  radiolucent  gallstones c an be foun d in the  Investigator’s B rochure (IB) . No 
prospectively designed clinica
l study has been conducted for the CTX indication. 
4.1. Rationale for Study Design 
4.1.1. Adult Cohort  
For patients in the adult cohort, this study will be a randomized, double- blind (DB), placebo -
controlled, 2- period × 2- treatment crossover trial with rescue medication to assess the efficacy 
and safety of CDCA in patients with CTX who are ≥16 years of age. The rationale for including 
adolescents who are at least 16  years of age in the adult cohort is bas ed upon the likelihood that 
most patients of this age would be prescribed the adult dose of 250 mg 3 times a day (TID). The 
50th percentile of weight for males and females at 191.5 months of age as indicated in the Center 
for Disease Control weight- for-age charts is 60.7 kg for males and 53.8 kg for females 
25
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  25 (https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/html_charts/wtage.htm). At 15 mg/kg/day, the dose for both 
males and females in the 50th percentile for weight would be above 750 mg. Additionally, there 
is past experience with treating pediatric and adolescent patients with the adult dose of 250 mg TID ( Berginer 2009; Duell  2018 ). Most adolescents who are 16 and 17 years old are essentially 
fully grown, and drug metabolism is more similar to adults than children at this point. Patients in 
the adult cohort are also followed closely with assessments so any progression of disease or 
change in biomarkers will be identified quickly during the withdrawal period. Parent or legal guardian consent and patient assent, if in the Investigator’s opinion the patient is able to 
understand and provide assent, will still be required for all patients less than 18 years old 
regardless of cohort assignment  unless otherwise directed by a reviewing Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).  
Approximately 12 male and/or female CDCA- naïve or CDCA -treated patients with CTX 
meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and whose clinical symptoms are stable during the open-label run-in period are planned to be randomized in the study. The 
randomized withdrawal design is intended to directly assess the impact of withdrawing CDCA 
treatment on biomarkers and symptoms. Owing to CDCA being the treatment of choice (or SoC) for CTX, treating physicians are extremely hesitant to take patients off CDCA treatment for any 
perio d. Extensive consultation with treating physicians and experts also indicates that appropriate 
measures to protect a patient’s well -being and unnecessary progression due to withholding 
CDCA treatment should be established within the study. A maximal duration of placebo withdrawal of 4 weeks with available CDCA rescue is planned to ensure the safety of 
participating patients.  
The crossover design with 2 double- blind periods allows for patients to be their own controls to 
account for the heterogeneity of dis ease manifestations across patients. Multiple measurements 
are planned to be taken within each period to account for intra- patient variability.  
The 8 -week open- label periods are intended to establish baseline levels of biomarkers and 
determine individual p atient symptoms and clinical manifestations while on CDCA.  
Analyses of bile alcohols reported in the published literature (data on file) showed a mean reduction from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) of 91% with very low variability (standard 
deviation [S D] = 13.4%). Every individual had a significant reduction in bile alcohol; the 
smallest reduction was 52.9%. This observation indicates a consistent and dramatic effect of 
CDCA on reduction of bile alcohols. Reductions in bile alcohols were present after l ess than 
1 month of treatment with CDCA with a mean reduction from baseline to EOT of 94% (SD = 1.042%) observed (n = 4). The effect appeared to be sustained in patients with a treatment 
duration between >1 month and >48 months. 
CDCA reduced cholestanol levels in patients with CTX. Reductions were observed within 
1 month
 of treatment and the reduction was even greater with longer term treatment. Evidence 
supports the stability of the response with treatment durations of more than 4 years 
(Koopman 1985
).  
Patients from the published literature with available baseline cholestanol levels had a mean (SD) 
baseline cholestanol level of 3.132 (3.4307) mg/dL. At EOT, a mean percent reduction from baseline of 75.3% was observed with low variability (SD = 19.6%). Foll owing treatment 
initiation, no patients with CTX had an increase in cholestanol levels, while in some patients, 
26
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
Confidential and Proprietary  26 cholestanol  levels were undetectable. The only pa tients whos e cholestanol  level did no t decrease 
were those with normal chol
estanol levels at baseline (Koopma n 1985) .  
Consistent result
s were observed when data was broken down by treatment duration. After less 
than a month of treatm
ent, a mean percent reduction from baseline of 64.7% was observed wit h a 
low variability (SD = 22.7% ). Similar reduct ions were observed betwee n 1 month and 48 m onths 
of trea
tment and after 48 months or more of treatment with CDCA (approximately 71.7% and 
84.5%, respectively). Results suggest that a sustainable change in cholestanol levels could be 
observe d shortly after treatment initiation and occurs independently of age (Koopman 1985) .  
Serum 7- alpha -hydroxy-4- cholesten -3-one (7αC4) and 7-alpha -12-alpha-dihydroxy-4- cholesten -
3-one (7α12αC4) have been proposed as important markers for diagnosis and monitoring of 
replacement therapy in CTX ( DeBarber 2010 ; DeBarber 2014a; DeBarber 2014b;
Bjorkhem 2013) . Circulating 7αC 4 closely mirrors cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation rate, thus 
reflecting  the activity o f the “classic” pa thway of  bile acid syn thesi s (Ber tolotti 2008).  
Furt
hermore, 7αC4 is str
ictly correlated with the accumulation of cholestanol in the brain in both 
CTX pa tients ( Panzenboeck 2007) and mice with disrupt
ion of sterol 27-hydroxylase
(Bå
vner 2010). In a study of 19 previously untreated CTX patients followed over 4 years, the 
patients ha d significantly e levated ( from 100 -fold to 200- fold increased) p lasma c oncent ration  of 
7αC4 compared to controls (p<0.01) (Mignarri 
2016). Serum levels of 7αC4 consistently 
decreased after CDCA treatment; however, 7αC4 never normalized in half of patients, and some 
degree of accumulati on appeare d to persist in most patients . A significant positive correlation  
was found betwe
en plasma values of 7αC4 and cholestanol (ρ=0.78; p<0.01). In addition to  
7αC4, 7α12αC4 will also be assessed. 7α12αC4 is an intermediate of bile acid synthesis 
downstream from 7αC4. Circulati ng levels of 7αC4 are indicative of regulation  of the bile a cid 
synthetic pathway and show a degree of natural diurnal varia
tion with variation observed in 
individuals without disease. In contrast, 7α12αC4 is almost undetectable in individuals without 
CTX and marked elevations are seen in pa tients with CTX . Thus, 7α12αC4 has emerged as a 
sensitive marker of misregulation of this pathway and is used in the diagnosis of the disease
(DeBarber 2014b) .

4.1.2. Extension of an Open- Label Period as a Result of COVID -19
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS- CoV- 2) was identified in hospitalized patients in 
Wuhan, China. Since then, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) has spread to thousands 
of international locations , including the United States, and was declared a global pandemic by 
the World Health Organization in March 2020. 
27
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  27 COVID-19 has had a global impact disrupting supply chains, transportation lanes, resource 
allocation within service providers, and day- to-day operations at health institutions. Successful 
study operations are dependent on these components – any disruption carries the risk of hindering the ability to properly manage patient safety and negatively impacting the integrity of resulting study data. CO VID-19 has forced many health institutions to limit nonessential on- site 
visitors, consistent with local and national social distancing guidelines. While clinical trial visits are permitted at most institutions, there is risk that visit restrictions may co ntinue, thereby 
affecting an Investigator’s ability to complete study visits and perform necessary safety 
evaluations.  
As the world faces a viral pandemic, it is critical that patient safety is preserved. Since the key 
risks previously noted may impact th e dispensation of blinded and/or open- label rescue 
medication, an extension to each open- label period will be added to the investigational plan to 
delay the start of a double-blind withdrawal period until, in the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Mon itor, the regional impact of this global health emergency has stabilized and study 
visits can proceed without interruption. The extension of the open- label periods will also ensure 
that patients continue to receive open -label study medication while completing appropriate safety 
monitoring.  
The extension visits in an open-label period will occur on a monthly basis, which aligns with the dispensation schedule of open-label study medication. Additionally, the monthly visit schedule reduces the burden placed on patients to travel to a health institution during a viral pandemic. 
Finally, monthly laboratory assessments are part of the standard of care for patients with CTX who are treated with CDCA.

 Confidential and Proprietary  28 4.1.3. Pediatric Cohort  
For patients in the pediatric cohort, t his is a 24 -week, open-label study with an 8- week titration 
period to identify a safe and tolerable dose and a 16- week treatment period at the safe and 
tolerated dose as maintenance treatment to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
CDCA in pediat ric cohort patients ≥1 month of age to <16 years of age with CTX. The limit of at 
least 1 month of age is to allow for molecular genetic sequencing confirmation of the CTX 
diagnosis.  
CDCA- naïve or CDCA- treated pediatric patients with CTX meeting all inclu sion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled. The main objective for this part of the 
study is to explore dosing, exposure, and safety in this important population.  
4.2. Rationale for Dose 
4.2.1. Adult Cohort  
CDCA is currently the SoC in the US for CTX and the proposed dose is 750 mg per day (as 250 mg TID) in adults. These doses were chosen empirically by clinicians based on the need to 
optimize the absorption of CDCA. Free CDCA is absorbed in the gut, transported to the liver, and then conjugates with glycine and taurine. Glyco- CDCA and Tauro -CDCA conjugates 
circulate in the enterohepatic circulation. Additionally, dividing the total dose into three portions maximizes the body’s ability to absorb CDCA from the gut in adults. Availa ble data indicate that 
treatment with CDCA 750  mg/day (typically administered as 250 mg TID) or higher is 
anticipated to result in maximal inhibition of bile acid synthesis. Further information on the rationale for the dose is provided in the IB. 
4.2.2. Pediatric  Cohort 
Doses for pediatric patients are consistent with doses currently prescribed in practice and 
report
ed extensively in the literature  (Salen 2017 )
. As pediatric patients tend to weigh less than 
adult
 patients, their dose is a weight -based dosing regimen at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day TID, as 
frequently prescribed to pediatric patients ( van Heijst 1998).  
A weight -
based dose titration of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg based on safety and tolerability followed by 
treatment at the maximum tolerated dose has been proposed for treatment -naïve pediatric cohort 
patients who participate in this study. Treatment -experienced pediatric cohort patients who 
participate in the study will initiate treatment at their current dosing regimen and titrate up to a 
maximum dose of 15 mg/k g/day TID based on safety and tolerability. Pediatric cohort dosing of 
CDCA will not exceed an equivalent dose of 750 mg/day.  
4.3. Rationale for Comparator Group- Adult Cohort 
In patients with CTX, Chenodal is considered a medical necessity and the SoC in the U S. There 
is no other available treatment that is appropriate to use as a comparator in assessing the effects 
of CDCA treatment in the general CTX population. The use of a placebo over a short duration as 
a comparator is justified as it presents the most ef ficient way to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of SoC therapy in this withdrawal study, with rescue measures in place to protect patient safety.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of CDCA in pa tients with CTX 
in comparison with placebo. 
5.1. Efficacy Objective 
• Determine the effects of CDCA, compared with placebo, on biomarkers and clinical 
symptoms of CTX in adult patients with CTX.  
5.2. Safety Objective 
• Assess the safety and tolerability of CDCA in adult and pediatric patients.  
5.3. Exploratory Objectives 
• Characterize the relationship among biomarkers in adult and pediatric patients.  
• Characterize steady -state pharmacokinetics (PK) of CDCA and 2 conjugated forms of 
CDCA, GlycoChenodeoxycholic Acid (gCDCA) and TauroChenodeoxycholic Acid 
(tCDCA) in adult patients.  
• Characterize the relationship between dose and PK concentration among pediatric 
patients.  
• Assess biomarkers and health status among pediatric patients treated with CDCA.  
6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design 
This study is made up of 2 designs: a randomized, double-blind, crossover study design among 
patients ≥16 years of age at Screening (adult cohort) and an OL, dose -titration and maintenance 
study design among pediatric patients ≥1 month and <16 ye ars of age at Screening (pediatric 
cohort). 
6.1.1. Adult Cohort  
Patients in the adult cohort will participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
2-period × 2 -treatment crossover study with rescue medication  to assess the efficacy and safety 
of CDCA in the treatment of CTX. Approximately 12 male and/or female CDCA-naïve or 
CDCA- treated patients ≥16 years of age at Screening with CTX meeting all inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria and whose clinical symptoms are stable during the OL run-in period (open-label period 1 [OL1]) are planned to be randomized in the study. At least 6 of the patients randomized in the study will be treatment-experienced (ie, those who have been on a 
stable dose of CDC A for at least 2  months prior to the run -in period). Patients who are either 
CDCA-naïve or those with less than 2 months of treatment prior to the run -in period are 
considered newly initiated patients.  
The study design is summarized in Figure 1.

Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
Confidential and Proprietary  30 Patients will be  screened at
 Visit 1 ( Screening;  Appendix 1) and those who sati sfy all the 
inclus
ion and none of the exclusi on criteria will participate in the 8-week OL1 to establis h 
reliable baseline  measurements for  biomarkers and other e fficacy assessments. P at ients who  fail 
screening  may be  rescreened as needed.  
A
dult cohort patients (≥16 year
s of age) will receive 250 m g open -label CDCA T ID during  the 
OL periods of the study (ie, OL1 and open-l
abel period 2 [OL2] ). During the DB periods 
(double- blind period 1 [DB1] and double- blind  period  2 [DB2]), a dult cohort patients w ill 
receive either blinded CD
CA 250 mg TID or matching placebo TID.  
Following the OL1 period, patients will be reassessed for eligibility before randomization 
(Day 1, Visit 6 [Appendix 1]). To be randomized, patients are required to have tolerated CDCA 
and not have developed any condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, warranted 
discontinuation of CDCA treatment. 
Adult cohort patients will be randomized on Day 1 at a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment sequences 
(AB or  BA) to e nter a 4- week DB period (DB1) , an 8-we ek OL period (OL2), a nd then a second 
4-week DB period  (DB2 ).
Bli
nded or open-label 25 0 mg CDCA TID rescue medicati on will be provided duri ng the DB 
periods , if needed, based on blinde d biomarkers (blinde d rescue) and/or clinical CTX-related 
symptoms (open-label rescue). Patients who require blinde d and/or open-label C DCA r escue 
medication  in a gi ven pe riod will remain  on the rescue  medication  for the re mainde r of the  
respective DB peri
od. Patients who require rescue medication during DB1 but otherwise remain 
eligible should continue to OL2 and then to DB2.  
Visits a t an alternative  site by  a trained  medical professiona l (eg,  lice nsed nurse) will be 
permitted t o reduce the travel burden f or patients . The visits that qualify for being conducted at 
an alternative site by a home health vendor are indicated in the Adult Cohort Schedule of 
Assessments (
SOA, Appendix 1) . 
After the la s
t dose of  study  medica
tion, patients ma y transition  to tr eatment for CTX pe r the 
guidance of the Investigator or prescribing physician. A safety follow- up phone call will be 
conducte d for all patients 30 (±7) days afte r last dose of study medication.

safety and tolerability (Table  1 and Appendix 2).  
• Treatment -naïve pediatric cohort patients will receive doses of 5 mg/kg/day (TID), 
10 mg/kg/day (TID), or 15 mg/kg/day (TID) titrated up every 2 weeks based on 
safety and tolerability over a period of 8 weeks.  
• Treatment -experienced pediatric cohort patients currently taking a dose ≥5 mg/kg/day 
of CDCA will start at their current dose and  titrate up every 2 weeks to the next dose 
level up to 15 mg/kg/day based on safety and tolerability over a period of 8 weeks. 
Patients with a history demonstrating intolerance at higher doses will not be required to dose escalate.  
• Pediatric dosing of CDCA will not exceed an equivalent dose of 750 mg/day.

per the guidance of the Investigator or the prescribing physician, including treatment with 
appropriate medic ations, as deemed necessary. Patients permanently discontinuing study 
medication who are not willing to continue with regular study visits, but who are willing to 
continue for their information to be used for this study, will be encouraged to remain in the 
study. The Investigator will contact the Sponsor’s designee to determine the best approach based 
on the patient’s situation.  
6.7. Discontinuation of the Patient from the Study  
Patients are free to withdraw consent and/or discontinue participation in the study at any time without prejudice to subsequent standard of care treatment. A patient’s participation in the study may also be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor. Patients 
may also be discontinued from the study if the st udy is terminated (see Section  17.3.5 ). 
Patients may be permanently discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:

In general, patients should be encouraged to remain in the study until they complete the study. A 
patient who permanently discontinues from the study will complete the ET assessments listed in 
the SOA ( Appendix 1 or Appendix 2)  as close as possible to the patient’s last dose of study 
medication or as soon as possible for those patients who had previously completed an EOT visit. 
The visit data, including the primary reason for premature discontinuation from the study, will be 
recorded on the early termination (ET) eCRF.  
Patients discontinuing from the study will not be replaced.  
6.8. Early Termination Visit and Withdrawal Procedures 
The end of study for patients com
pleting the study is on Visit 18 both for the adult and pediatric 
cohorts.   
For patients in the adult and pediatric cohorts who are withdrawn from the study prior to 
completion, all ET procedures will be performed at an ET visit, as indicated in the SOA 
(Appendix 1 and Appendix 2). In addition to the ET visit, patients who discontinue the study 
prior to completion will be contacted (via telephone call) 30 (±7) days after the last dose of study 
medicati on to ascertain patient safety. If the patient who has discontinued the study prior to 
completion  complete d their last dose of study medication ≥23 days prior to their ET visit, then 
patient sa fety m ay be  ascertained du ring the ET visit rather than a safety phone call. The 
completion  of the  ET visit will mark the  end of study  for that pa tient.  
6.9. Lost to Follow -up 
The Investigator must make every effort to contact patients who fail to return for scheduled visits 
so that they will not be declared “lost to follow -up.”  Patients will be considered “lost to 
follow -up” only after reasonable, documented attempts to reach the patient prove 
unsuccessful.  These attempts include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1. Contact all telephone numbers for the patient and his/her listed contacts (to be collected
in the source at the patient’s entry into the study), as applicable.
2.Contact the patient’s primary care physician, referring specialist, or other healthcareprofessional, as applicable.
3.Send email, text, and postal mail with certified letters to all the patient’s addresses and
contacts, as applicable.
4.Review available med ical records/notes for details of hospitalizations, clinic visits, or
other procedures that may indicate the status of the patient, as applicable.
5.Utilize the internet to search for additional contact information, as applicable.
6.Check local, regional, and national public records to locate the patient or search for
mortality status as allowed by law, as applicable.
The information and dates of attempted contact must be recorded in the patient’s records and the patient’s final status recorded in  the appropriate eCRF. Once these actions have been exhausted 
and documented, the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee should be contacted for additional guidance.

Eligibility must be confirmed and signed/dated informed consent must be obtained prior to any 
study- related procedure from the patient or from the parent/legal guardian if the patient is 
<18 years or mentally incapacitated. Assent must be obtained prior to any study -related 
procedure from patients who are <18 years old or patients who are mentally incapacitated if, in the Investigator’s opinion, the patient is able to understand and provide assent. 
7.1. Inclusion Criteria  
Male and female patients with a clinical diagnosis of CTX are eligible for this study if they meet all of the following criteria:  
1.The patient or parent/legal guardian (as appropriate) is willing and able to provide signed
informed consent, and where required, the patient is willing to provide assent, prior to
any screening procedures.
2.The patient is ≥1 month of age at the time of signing the informed consent and assent, as
applicable.
3.Clinical diagnosis of CTX with biochemical confirmation. For treatment-experiencedpatients, documented historical confirmation of serum cholestanol and/or bile alcohol isacceptable. For tr eatment -naïve patients, serum cholestanol and urine 23S- pentol levels
will be obtained prior to initiating open -label CDCA.
4.If the patient is currently being treated with CDCA at a dose different than theprotocol-specified dose, the patient must be willing to change his or her current dose.
5. With Medical Monitor approval, patients currently taking CDCA and riluzole for the
treatment of ataxia are eligible, provided their ataxia is well controlled and they havebeen on a stable dose of riluzole for a minimum of 6 months.
6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), beginning at menarche, must agree to the
use of 1 highly reliable (ie, can achieve a failure rate of <1% per year) method ofcontraception during the course of the study. Highly reliable contraception methods
include stable oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected contraceptive hormones associated
with inhibition of ovulation, or an intrauterine device (IUD) in place for at least3 months. One additional barrier method must also be used during sexual a ctivity, such as
a diaphragm with spermicide or male partner’s use of male condom with spermicide,during the course of the study. WOCBP are defined as those who are fertile, followingmenarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile; permanent
sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral
oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as amenorrhea for more than24 consecutive months without an alternative medical cause; women on hormone
replacement therapy must have a documented plasma follicle- stimulating hormone level
>40 mIU/mL. All WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening
.
NOTE: Prior to menarche, pregnancy testing and contraceptive use is not required.However, the patient and their parent/legal guardian must be advised that, immediately
upon menarche, the patient will be required to begin pregnancy testing and initiatecontraceptive use. This requirement cannot be avoided.

8.1. Study Medication  
Study medication refers to: 
• Open -label CDCA, which is received during the run-in period, open-label period, and 
for open- label rescue CDCA for the adult cohort and all study medication in the 
pediatric cohort  
• Blinded CDCA, which is received during a double-blind period or as blinded rescue 
CDCA in the adult cohort 
• Blinded placebo in the adult cohort 
8.2. Description of Study Medication  
Adult cohort patients will receive 250 mg CDCA TID during the open-label periods of the study 
(ie, OL1 and OL2). During the double-blind periods (DB1 and DB2), adult cohort patients will 
receive either CDCA 250 mg TID or matching placebo TID based upon their treatment assignment, either AB or BA ( Table 2 ). Those assigned to AB will receive blinded 250 mg 
CDCA TID during DB1 period and placebo TID during the DB2 period. Those assigned to BA will receive placebo TID during  DB1 period and blinded 250 mg CDCA TID during the DB2 
period.  
Rescue 250 mg CDCA TID (blinded or unblinded) will be administered, if needed, based upon 
criteria described in  Section  8.3. 
Pediatric cohort patients will receive open -label CDCA. Pediatric cohort patients who turn 
16 years of age while participating in the study will remain in the pediatric cohort and continue dosing with open- label CDCA. Patients who are able to take an equivalent weight-based dose of 
750 mg/day and are capable of swallowing a tablet will have the option to take CDCA 250 mg 
tablets TID or the liquid suspension form of CDCA.

the non -proprietary name for CDCA  
8.3. Rescue Medication Criteria in the Adult Cohort 
Blinded or open- label 250  mg CDCA TID rescue medication will be provided during the DB 
periods, if needed, based on blinded biomarkers (blinded rescue) and/or clinical CTX- related 
symptoms (open-label rescue). Patients who require blinded and/or open- label CDCA rescue 
medication in a given period will remain on the rescue medication f or the remainder of the 
respective DB period. Patients who require rescue during DB1 but otherwise remain eligible 
should continue to OL2 and then to DB2.  
Blinded CDCA will be provided to patients who meet the following criterion: increase of 
10 times the  baseline value for a given period (ie, Visits 6 and 14) in urine 23S- pentol. Blinded 
CDCA will be assigned through the Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IxRS) at the next

protocol. The  Inve stigator is r esponsible for evaluating  patien
ts to determine  if they mee t the 
criteria for r escue medication  at
 each follow -up visit duri
ng DB1 and DB2 (Appendix 1). 
The specific r easons  (see Appendix 4 and Appendix 5) contributing  to the  Inve stigator decision  
and supportive data will be collected
 in the database. All assessments should continue as 
indicated in the SOA (Appendix 1). 
8.4. Concomitant Medications  
Any medication or vaccine (including over- the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the patient is receiving at the time of enrollment or receive s 
during the study must be recorded along with: 
•Reason for use
•Dates of administration including start and end dates
•Dosage information including dose and frequency
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy. 
If the patient is receiving anticoagulants, the patient should be well- controlled in the judgment of 
the Investigator to continue receiving study medication.  
8.5. Prohibited Medications  
Patients currently taking Chenodal® and/or an alternative therapy for CTX are required to stop 
their medication/therapy prior to the start of study medication in OL1 for the adult cohort or the 
titration period for the pediatric cohort. Patients may resume or start taking Chenodal® and/or an 
alternative therapy f or CTX after completing the study (ie, EOS visit) or permanently 
discontinuing study medication. 
Patients should not take medications that impact bile acid absorption, such as bile acid 
sequestering agents (eg, cholestyramine, colestipol, aluminum- based an tacids). Patients should 
not take cholic acid medication.  
8.6. Treatment Compliance 
The patient must return the container and unused study medication (if any) to the study site for 
a compliance check  at the visits specified in  the SOA (Appendix 1 or Appendix 2).

Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  45 8.7. Randomization and Blinding for the Adult Cohort 
Adult cohort patients will be randomized on Day 1 (Visit 6) at a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment 
sequences (AB or BA). Patients randomized to sequence AB will receive blinded CDCA TID for 
4 weeks or until open- label rescue medication criteria are triggered; patients randomized t o 
sequence BA will receive placebo TID for 4 weeks or until either the blinded and/or open- label 
rescue medication criteria are triggered.  
The patient’s treatment allocation will remain blinded to all parties involved with the study throughout its course, with the exception of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) (see 
Section  17.1 ), study medication supply, the SAE reporting contact, Unblinded Study Monitor, 
and the independent statistical team(s) supporting the DMC. The randomization schedule for treatment allocation will be securely maintained and will not be disclosed until after database 
lock. Doses allowed during the study are shown in Table 2 , and dose modifications are not 
allowed ( Section  6.5). 
For emergency unblinding only, randomization codes and corresponding treatment assignments will be made available to the Investigator through the interactive response technology (IRT) 
system.  When possible, the Medical Monitor should be consulted if a medical emergency 
necessitates unblinding (ie, in situations where knowledge of the unblinded treatment is 
necessary for further medical management of the patient).  If it is not reasonable to inform the 
Medical Monitor in advance of unblinding, the Invest igator must promptly document the case in 
the patient’s study record. Subsequently, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor to explain any premature unblinding of treatment assignment (eg, accidental unblinding or 
unblinding due to an SAE). Pro cedures for unblinding a patient’s treatment will be provided 
separately to the Investigator.  Similarly, if the Medical Monitor breaks the blind to evaluate an 
emergent safety issue or for regulatory reporting purposes, the Medical Monitor will document within study correspondence the rationale, circumstances, and the person(s) being informed 
about the unblinding. 
Access to randomization codes and corresponding treatment assignments will also be made 
available through the IRT system to the appropriate, name d individual(s) responsible for 
unblinding suspected, unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) for reporting to 
regulatory authorities.

Blinded CDCA or placebo is administered orally at home. Patients ≥16 years of age will receive 
250 mg blinded CDCA or placebo TID. On days of study site visits, patients should hold the first 
administration of study medication until on site. 
9.4. Open -Label CDCA Administration in Pediatric Cohort  
For pediatric cohort patients (≥1 month and <16 years of age), t he CDCA tablet will be carefully 
crushed by the pharmacist and added to a sodium bicarbonate solution 8.4% (1 mmol/mL) to create a 10  mg/mL liquid suspension (ie, one 250-mg tablet per 25 mL) and supplied to the 
patient for oral administration (Table 2 ). Pediatric cohort patients who are able to take an 
equivalent weight -based dose of 750 mg/day and are capable of swallowing a tablet will have the 
option to take CDCA 250 mg tablets TID or the liquid suspension form of CDCA. 
On days of study visits, patients should hold the first administration of study medication until 
after completing visit assessments.  
Study medication may be transported directly to a patient via a traceable courier and/or shipping 
provider to ensure uninterrupted treatment, if necessary. Before doing this, sites will be 
instructed to acquire verbal agreement from the patient or caregiver, verification of correct shipping address, and th e patient’s or caregiver’s availability to receive the shipment. 
Confirmation of receipt and the shipping process will be documented in the site source documentation. The patient’s identity and personal information will continue to be kept confidential and  will not be shared with the Sponsor. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for 
additional details.  
9.5. Study Medication Accountability  
Blinded and open-label CDCA and placebo will be stored at each study site pharmacy, which 
will be locked with restricted access. No additional procedures are required for the safe handling 
of the tablets.  
The storage temperature in the study site pharmacy where CDCA and placebo are stored must be 
recorded by using a minimum/maximum thermometer or electronically, 24 hours a day, with 
printouts available. Any deviation from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to the Sponsor or Clinical Research Organization (CRO).  
Recommendations for study participants: the tablets should be kept in the original packaging (bottles). The bottles should be stored in the study participant’s home at room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]) and out of reach of children and away from direct sunlight. No study 
medication should be given to other persons. 
If necessary because an on -site visit by the patient is not feasible, CDCA or placebo bottles may 
be transported directly to a patient via courier to ensure uninterrupted treatment. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to document this process in the patient's source documents. 
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional details.

10. STUDY PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SOA (Appendix 1 or 
Appendix 2 ). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
•Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Investigator, Medical  
Monitor, and Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the 
patient should continue or discontinue study intervention.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SOA  
(Appendix 1 or Appendix 2), is essential and required for study conduct.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and
 reviewed to confirm that potential  
patients meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to  
record details of all patients screened an
d to confirm eligibility or record  reasons for  
screening failure, as applicable.
•Study procedures related to the extension of the open-l abel period
 because of  
COVID-1 9 and their timing are summarized  in the Schedule of Assessments
(Appendix 6
).
•If an on-site visit is not feasible, in
vestigators may interface with patients via  
telephone or video conferencing.
10.1. Study Visits in the Adult Cohort 
The adult cohort will be approximately 24 to 28 weeks in duration. The adult cohort includes a 
screening period, an open- label run -in period (OL1), the first DB period (DB1) followed by an 
OL period (OL2), and then a second DB period (DB2) ( Figure  1). The duration of the adult 
cohort may extend beyond 28 weeks if the start of a double-blind period is delayed due to COVID-19. 
The screening perio d is up to 28 days (4 weeks) before OL1 begins. The screening period begins 
when a patient undergoes a screening assessment after signing informed consent. OL1 lasts for 
8 weeks with biweekly study visits. Randomization occurs on Day 1, which is the first day of 
DB1. During DB1, patients will visit the study site on a weekly basis for 4 weeks. OL2 lasts

11. SCREENING ASSESSMENTS
Laboratory samples required at Screening may be collected across multiple days to reduce blood 
volume drawn on a single day. Laboratory samples at Screening do not have to be collected in 
fasting conditions. Screening laboratory result s must be received before OL1 Week 1 in the adult 
cohort and before Titration Start in the pediatric cohort. If screening results a re not available 
prior to the end of the patient’s 28-day screening period (adult and pediatric cohorts), the 
patient’s screening may be extended up to 2 additional weeks with approval by the Medical 
Monitor. If a patient’s screening window is extended, the patient is not required to repeat 
screening assessments. 
Screening assessments for the a
dult 
and pediatric cohorts w
ill be co llected according to the 
respective SOA (Appendix 1 or Appendix 2).   
Clinical chemistry, hematology, thyroid stimulating hormone, serologic and coagulation (adult 
cohort only) tests, as well as routine urinalysis will be conducted  and are listed in Appendix 3. 
For WOCBP, a serum pregnancy test will be conducted. In addition to the urinalysis conducted 
at the study site, first morning void on 3 mornings within 5 days prior to the visit wil l  be 
collected and brought to the site visit for urine 23S-p entol analysis. Alternatively, the patient 
may bring
 these urine s
amples to the site after the Screening visit and before the first day of the

12.3. Assessments P erformed  at Clinic V isits 
The following assessments and instruments will be conducted at the clinic to document 
CTX- related s ymptoms a nd manifes tations  to aid the  Investigator  in evaluating  potential disease 
progression  i
n each pa tient. Whi le results of t hese assessments ar e not ne cessarily considered

The Investigator must review the laborator y report, document this review, and recor d any 
clinica lly significant changes occurring duri ng the study i n the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports mus t be filed w ith the  source d ocuments. C linically s ignificant abnormal

Confidential and Proprietary  56 •If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged
reasonable by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor and
CRO notified.
•All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 3, must be
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SOA (Appendix 1 ,
Appendix 2, or Appendix 6 ).
•If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at
the institution’s local laboratory or at th
e central laboratory require a change in  the
patient’s management or are considered c
linically significant by the In vestigator (eg,
SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded as an AE or SAE
in the eCRF and if an SAE, an SAE form should be completed as per Section 14.2.
14.2. Adverse Event Reporting  
14.2.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. 
All AEs should be recorded and reported. AEs may include:  
•Symptoms described by the patient
•Clinically significant changes in the patient’s physical examination or other s igns
observed by the Investigator or medical staff
•Test abnormalities (laboratory tests, ECG, X -rays, etc.) that reflect a change from
baseline and/or that may result in changes in administration of study medication or in
an alteration in medical care (diagnostic or therapeutic)
•Conditions present at baseline that have either worsened or recurred followingresolution
Note:  It is anticipated that some patients will have a worsening of the underlying condition of 
the disease, such as increasing diarrhea. Any such conditions considered by the Investigator to be worsening of the underlying condition should be reported as AEs. Investigators should also report such AEs as part of the clinical rescue assessment as 
appropriate ( Section  12.4).  
The patient will be evaluated for new AEs and the status of existing AEs at each study visit, 
including screening or washout periods, or at any time contact is made with the patient outside of 
a scheduled visit. The Investigator may elicit symptoms using an open- ended question, followed 
by appropriate questions that clarify the patient’s verbatim description of AEs or change in 
concomitant medications.

Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  57 14.2.2. Serious Adverse Event (S AE) 
An SAE is an AE that results in any of the following: 
• Death:  The patient died as the result of the event.  
• Is life -threatening:  An AE that places the patient, in the view of the Investigator or 
the Sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, ie, does not 
include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires in -pati ent hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization  
Note:  Planned or elective hospital admissions for treatment/proc edures for a 
condition/disease that existed prior to signing the informed consent will be recorded 
in the patient’s screening documents and will not be captured as SAEs. If, however, 
the admission or procedure occurs other than planned due to a worsening of the condition, the event will be recorded as an SAE. 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity:  An AE that results in a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect :  A c ongenital anomaly/birth defect that occurs in 
the offspring of a patient exposed to the study medication. 
• Other medically important serious events:  An AE that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
14.2.3. Eval
 uation of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events 
14.2.3.1. Causality Assessment  
Assessment of the relationship between the AE and exposure to the study medication is 
important for regulatory reporting and assists in the overall analysis of the safety information. 
For each AE/SAE the Investigator will determine whether, base d on available evidence, there is 
a reasonable possibility that the study medication caused the event. Causal relationship will be 
classified according to the following criteria:  
• Not Related :  The re is no suspicion of a causal relationship between exposure and the 
AE. 
• Unlikely Related :  Ther e is no evidence for a causal relationship between exposure 
and the AE; however, such a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• Possibly Related :  Ther e is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal 
relationship betw een exposure and the AE.  
• Related: There is strong evidence that there is a causal relationship between exposure 
and the AE. 
A causality assessment will be provided for each AE/SAE recorded, even if there is only limited 
informa
tion at the time.  
58
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  58 Upon receip t of follow -up information, the Investigator may change his/her assessment of 
causality and amend the AE/SAE report accordingly. 
14.2.3.2. Severity  
Severity indicates the intensity of the event and should not be confused with seriousness (ie, 
Section  14.2.2), which is an event outcome applied for the purpose of event classification and 
regulatory reporting.  
The Investigator will assess the severity of all AEs/SA Es as mild, moderate, or severe, based on 
the following definitions:  
• Mild:  A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment 
or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. 
• Moderate:  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
• Severe:  A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
14.2.3.3. Outcome  
O
utcome describes the status of the AE. The Investigator will provide information regarding the 
patient outcome of each AE. Definitions for possible results of an AE outcome include: 
• Recovered/Resolved :  th e event has improved or the patient recuperated  
• Recovering/Resolving:  the event is improving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved :  the event has not improved or the patient has not 
recuperated  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae:  the patient recuperated but retained pathological 
conditions directly resulting from the disease or injury  
• Fatal :  termination of life as a result of an AE. There should be only one AE marked 
with this outcome  
• Unknown:  not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused 
14.2.3.4. Action Taken Regarding the Study Medication 
The action taken with regard to the study medication in response to the AE will be provided at the time the event is reported. Options for action taken include the following: 
• Drug Withdrawn :  me
 dication schedule was modified by permanently terminating a 
prescribed regimen of medication  
• Dose Reduced :  med ication schedule was modified by subtraction, either by changing 
the frequency, strength, or amount 
59
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  59 • Dose Not Changed:  medication schedule was maintained  
• Drug Interrupted:  medication schedule was modified by temporarily terminating a 
prescribed regimen of medication  
• Unknown:  not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused  
• Not Applicable :  determination of a value is not relevant in the current context, for 
example, if the AE began and ended prior to treatment or after discontinuation of 
treatment  
14.2.3.5. Assessment  of Expectedness 
The expectedness of an SAE will be determined by the Sponsor in accordance with the 
Reference Safety Information (which is contained in the IB).  
14.2.4. Adverse Events of Interest  
An AEOI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. 
All AEOIs must be reported to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s first knowledge of the event, regardless of cau sal relationship.  
Abnormalities in ALT, AST, and total bilirubin are considered AEOIs and must be reported to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor within 24 hours of awareness if one of the following conditions are met:  
• The abnormality represents a new elevation in AL
 T or AST >3 times the ULN, with 
or without an elevation of total serum bilirubin >2 times ULN; or 
• The abnormality represents a 2 -fold increase in ALT or AST above the baseline value 
in patients who had elevated values prior to starting study medication. 
In such instances, the following steps should be taken: 
• Temporarily discontinue study medication. 
• Repeat testing of ALT, AST, liver-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin; to be completed within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the abnormalit ies. 
• If the abnormality is confirmed by repeat results or after consulting with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor:  
− Complete an AEOI Report Form that documents both the liver function test 
findings and any associated signs or symptoms, and report by email to the SAE 
contact on the  Study Contact Information  page of this protocol.  
− Monitor liver enzymes and serum bilirubin 2 or 3 times weekly. The frequency of 
re-testing can decrease to once weekly  or less if the abnormalities stabilize and 
the patient is asymptomatic.  
− Perform additional testing to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (eg, international normalized ratio [INR] and direct bilirubin).  
60
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  60 • Do not resume study medication until monitoring indicates abnormalities have 
resolved or stabilized.  
Patients are not allowed to resume study medication, unless approved by the Medical Monitor, if they have: 
• ALT or AST >8 times ULN  
• ALT or AST >5 times ULN for more than 2 weeks 
• ALT or AST >3 times ULN an d total bilirubin >2 times ULN or INR >1.5  
• ALT or AST >3 times ULN with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5% eosinophils)  
Management of such patients should be closely coordinated with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
In addition to monitoring liver function tests, the Investigator should perform other relevant 
clinical and laboratory measurements to identify potential causes of the abnormalities (eg, acute 
viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non- alcoholic 
steatohepatitis; biliary tract disease or exposure to hepatotoxic medications or environmental 
chemical agents).  
Cases of increased liver function tests will always be considered serious ( ie, medically 
important) if they meet both the following criteria: 
• Study medication is suspected to have caused hepatocellular injury, generally shown 
by a confirmed elevation of 3-fold or greater above ULN in ALT or AST; and, 
• The ALT or AST elevations are accompanied by a total bilirubin >2 times the ULN 
or INR >1.5, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum liver- specific 
ALP)  
14.2.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events of 
Interest  
14.2.5.1. Reporting Adverse Events  
AEs (including SAEs) will be captured from the time informed consent is signed to the patient’s 
final visit. In addition, AEs (including SAEs) will be collected for all patients via a follow -up 
phone call 30  (±7) days after the last dose of study medicatio n to assess patient safety.  
• AEs will be recorded using appropriate medical terminology. When recording, it is preferable to provide a diagnosis. In the absence of a diagnosis, each sign and 
symptom will be captured as a unique AE. Sufficient information should be sought to assist the Investigator both in determining the diagnosis and in making a causality 
assessment.  
• Reporting should not be delayed pending receipt of all required information. If 
information is unavailable at the time of the initial report,  the Investigator is expected 
to follow up until the required information has been obtained.

Confidential and Proprietary  61 14.2.5.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The necessity and time requirements for reporting of SAEs to the Sponsor or its designee and/or 
regulatory agencies are as follows: 
•All SAEs will be reported
 by email to the SAE contact on the Study Contact page of 
this protocol or by fax to the number in the Investigator Site File within 24 hours of  
the Invest igator’s first knowledge of the event, regardless of causal relationship.
•A completed SAE
 Report Form containing a detailed  written description of the event  
along with available supporting documents (eg, discharge summary, autopsy report,  
diagnostic test results, etc.) will be provided by email to the SAE contact on the 
Study Contact 
page or by fax to the number in the Investigator Site File.
•Additional information that is not available at the time the initial SAE Report Form  
was completed will be promptly reviewed and provided by email to the SAE contact  
on the Study Contact  page or by fax 
to the number in the Investigator Site File within  
48 hours of receipt. Full supporting documentation should be solicited by the study  
site even if the SAE occurred at another institution. Such documentation may include  
copies of relevant patient/hospital records, discharge summaries, laboratory/test  
results, or autopsy reports.
•If at any time
 after the patient has completed participation in the study and for
30 days post end of study (EOS), the Investigator or study staff becomes aware of an 
SAE th
at they suspect is related to the study medication (see Section 14.2.3.1), the 
event and any known details will be reported promptly by email to the SAE contact  
on the Study 
Contact page or by fax to the number in the Investigator Site File, 
following the reporting instructions in this section.
•For medical emergencies, the IxRS can be used at any time by the Investigator to 
notify the Sponsor for unblinding permissions, if deemed necessary to manage the 
event. For SUSARs, the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
designee responsible for 
managing SAEs will access the IxRS to obtain the patient’s treatment assignment for  
the purpose of regulatory reporting. Refer to the study manuals for unblinding  
procedures.
14.2.5.2.1. Follow- u
p of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs  will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until completion of the 
patient’s participation or study termination, whichever occurs first.  
Serious AEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until th e 
Investigator and the Sponsor agree that follow-up is no longer necessary.  
All AEs/SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact where event outcome is designated as not 
recovered/not resolved, recovering/resolving, or unknown will be reviewed by the Inves tigator at 
subsequent visits/contacts. SAEs that are ongoing after completion of the last scheduled visit will 
continue to be followed to determine the final outcome.  
Rules for AE/SAE follow -up apply to all patients, to the extent allowed by the patient’s consent. 
The Investigator will ensure that follow up includes further investigations consistent with

to the SAE contact on the Study Contacts page of this protocol or by fa x to the number in the 
Investigato r Site F ile w ithin the  specified timelines. A dditional AE s/SAEs ma y be identified  
during the revi
ew of follow-up information a nd will be processed in accordance with 
requirement s defined t hroughout Section  14.2. 
14.2.5.2.2.  Reporting to Regulatory Authorities, Investigators and Institutional Review 
Boards/Independent E thics Committees 
The Sponsor will ensure that processes are in place for provision of SAEs and Expedited SAE 
reports (SUSARs) to Regulatory Authorities , Investigators, and IRBs/IECs, as required, within 
the specified t imelines.  
The Sponsor will sub mit SAE a nd/ or SUSAR re ports to reg ulatory authorities and the 
Investigato r as re quired.  In the US, Investigators will report SAEs a nd SUSARs to the ir IRB in 
accordan
ce with applicable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and/or local reporting 
requirements. In the European Union (EU), the Sponsor or its designee will notify the IEC of any 
SUS
ARs. 
Investiga
tors will forward copies of the IRB/IEC notificati on to the Sponsor or its designee, 
when applicable. 
14.2.6.  Pregnancy R eporting 
Although not an AE in itself, exposure to study medication during pr egnancy must b e reported; 
therefore, all pr egnancies w ill be  reported v ia an initial Pregnancy N otification  Form. I f a pa tient 
becomes pr
egnant during the study, study medication will be immediatel y discontinued, and 
pre
gnanc y will be documente d as the reason for study medication discontinuation. If a urine 
pregnanc y test is positive, study medication will be immediately discontinued until a serum 
pregnancy test conf irms t he result . 
If the  Investigator suspects tha t a pr e gnancy w as the re su lt of an int eraction between the study 
medi
cation and the contraceptive method, in additi on to the pregnanc y, the study medication 
interaction  will a lso be  captured as a separate AE.  
The Investigator will report any pregnancy associated wit h exposure to study medication 
throughout the study period. When a site becomes aware that a patient is pregnant , they are to 
contact the  Medical Monitor  immediately (w ithin 24 hour s of the site becoming  aw are of  the 
event), 
complete an initial Pregnancy Notification Form, and send the form by email to the SAE 
contact on the Study Contacts  
page of this protocol or by fax to the n umber in the In vestigator 
Site F ile. 
F
emale p atients w ill be  instructed to not ify the  Investigator immediately if they discove r they a re 
pr
egnant. M ale pa tients will be  instructed to no tify the  Investigator immediately i f they di scove r 
that their se
xual partne r is pr egnant.  In the  latte r instance, the  partner must provide w ritten 
cons
ent before pregnancy information can be collected.

will complete the Pregnancy forms and submit them to the study contact on the Study Contacts 
page of this protocol or by fax t o the number in the Investigator Site File. 
All pregnancies will be followe d to outcome (ie, delivery, elective termination, spontaneous 
abortion). T he Inve stigator will inform the  patient that the  Sponsor or its designee is r equired to 
gather information regarding the course and outcome of the pregnancy after exposure to the 
study medication. All study-relate d visits/contacts involvi ng a know n pregnancy will include 
pregnancy status assessment until pregnancy outcome is know n. The Investigator should further 
obtain fol low-up information no later than 1 month after the gestational period to obtain 
maternal/fetal/neonatal outcome and any other relevant information. Upon obtaini ng pregnancy 
outcome, the Inve stigator w ill complete the  Pregnancy O utcome for m a nd submit it to the  study 
contact on t

Site
 File.  
All information relate d to the pregnancy and i ts outcome will be assessed for  the occurrence o f 
an AE or SAE. Should an AE or SAE occur in the mother or the child, it will be pr ocessed per 
study guidelines. Spontaneous abortions and stillbirths will always be reported as SAEs. If the 
pregnancy results in the birth o f a ch ild, the neonate shoul d be followed for a minimum of 
4 weeks postdeliver y. In certain cases, it may be necessary to follow up on the long-term 
outcome of an AE using the Pregnancy Follow-up Form. I f needed, an SAE report form will be 
completed and provided by email to the SAE contact on the Study Contacts page of this protocol 
or by fax t o 
the number in the Investigator Site File. 
15. DATA COLLECTION, QUALITY ASSURANCE, AND
MANAGEMENT
15.1. Recording of Data  
The study will use eCRFs for data collection wherever possible. Data collection points identified 
for data entry by the site will be performed by trained site personnel only. The Investig ator is 
responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed promptly and correctly and that the data can be verified against source data. Additional data may be collected directly from contracted organizations as described in the data management plan and/or data transfer plans. 
AEs and medical history will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Similarly, prior and concomitant medications and concomitant therapies will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD).  
15.2. Data Quality Assurance 
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor or its designee may conduct a quality assurance audit.  
15.3. Data Management 
Data management will be performed by a qualified vendor under their SOPs. The Sponsor will provide oversight.

Confidential and Proprietary  64 16. STATISTICS
16.1. Sample Size Justification and Power Analysis for Adult Cohort
The hypothesis to be tested is H 0: Δ = 0 against H a: Δ ≠ 0, where Δ is the true paired treatment 
difference betw een CDCA and placebo for the change from baseline in log e-transformed urine 
23S-pentol. The planned sample size is expected to provide at least 90% power at the final 
analysis (approximately 12 patients; two sided nominal α = 0. 0436). For the sample size 
calculation, it is assumed that the true average paired treatment difference between CDCA and 
placebo in change from baseline in the log e-transformed urine 23S-pentol is -2.4 with a standard 
deviation no higher than 1.15. In a meta- analysis of the literature data from eleven CTX patients 
receiving CDCA treatment, the mean reduction from baseline in log e-transformed urine 
23S-pentol was 3.1 with a 1.15 SD. The assumed 2.4 difference between CDCA and placebo is 2 
standard errors (SEs) less than the observed 3. 1 reduction. 
For the proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment (secondary endpoint), the planned 
sample size of approximately 12 patients at the final analysis is expected to provide at least 85% 
power with two sided nominal α = 0.0436. This assume s that 85% of patients (approximately 
10/12) on placebo and 15% of patients (approximately 2/12) on CDCA will need rescue 
treatment, with a discordance of 80%, based on McNemar’s test.  
16.2. Analysis Sets 
16.2.1. Adult Cohort  
Enrolled Analysis Set (EAS) : All adult cohort patients who signed informed consent and take at 
least one dose in the open- label run -in period. This will be used to assess patient characteristics, 
disposition during the run-in period, and overall safety presentation during the study. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All adult cohort patients who are randomized and take at least one 
dose of randomized study medication will be included in the FAS. Patients in the FAS will be 
analyzed according to randomized treatment assignment. All efficacy analyses will be based on 
the FAS.  
•Treatment -Experienced Full Analysis Set (TEFAS) : All adult cohort patients in the
FAS who had been on CDCA for at least 2 months prior to the OL run-in period.
•Newly -Initiated Full Analysis Set (NIFAS) : All adult cohort patients in the FAS
who are either treatment -naïve or had been on CDCA for less than 2 months prior to
the OL run-in period.
Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) : The PPAS is a subset of the FAS containing adult cohort 
patients who meet study eligibility requirements, have at lea st one efficacy measurement in the 
DB2 treatment period, and have no protocol deviations that might impact the assessment of efficacy measurements. Patients will be analyzed according to randomized treatment sequence assignment. The PPAS will be used for sensitivity analyses relating to efficacy. The type of 
protocol deviations governing exclusion from the PPAS will be determined prior to breaking the 
blind and will be detailed in the SAP. 
65
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
Confidential and Proprietary  65 Safety Analysis Set (SAS) : All adult cohort patients who are randomi zed and take at least one 
dose of randomized therapy will be included in the SAS. The SAS will be used for safety 
analyses during the double-blind period and will be based upon randomized study medication 
actually received.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PK AS): All adult cohort patients in the EAS with evaluable PK 
samples will be included in the PKAS. The PKAS will be used for summaries of PK concentration and assessment of PK parameters.  
16.2.2. Pediatric Cohort  
Pediatric Safety Analysis Set (PSAS) : All pediatric cohort patients whose parent/legal guardian 
signed informed consent and received at least one dose of study medication. This will be used to assess patient characteristics, disposition, biomarkers, health status, and overall safety presentation for pediatr ic cohort patients.  
16.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and relevant baseline characteristics will be presented and summarized for the EAS, FAS, and PSAS.  
16.4. Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints will first be summarized by descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be summarized by mean, SD, SE, confidence intervals (CIs), median, quartiles, minimum, and 
maximum. For parameters analyzed in the log
e-scale such as urine 23S -pentol, geometric mean 
and % coefficient of variati on (CV) will also be presented.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by count, percentage, or shift tables (if applicable). 
Descriptive statistics will be produced separately for adult cohort and pediatric cohort patients. 
The following sections describe inferential statistical testing procedures for efficacy endpoints collected during the double-blind period among adult cohort patients.  
16.4.1. Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint of Urine 23S- Pentol  
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint of change from baseline in log
e-transformed urine 
23S-pentol at the end of each DB treatment period will be conducted via a paired t- test 
comparing CDCA with placebo using the FAS (adult cohort). Log- transformation is performed 
due to the anticipated wide range of urine 23S-pentol levels among CTX patients. Urine 23S- pentol will be determined using first morning void urine samples and will be c alculated as 
the geometric mean of 3  first morning void urine samples collected within 5 days prior to each 
visit at which urine 23S- pentol is assessed. The baseline value for the first double -blind period is 
the measurement taken for Day 1; the baseline v alue for the second double-blind period is the 
measurement taken at Day 85 at the beginning of the second DB period. Measurements obtained 
after initiation of rescue medication will be considered “missing” for purposes of the primary 
analysis. An appropria te multiple imputation (MI) method will be used to impute missing values 
and the values after initiating rescue medication, under the assumption of missing at random 
(MAR). The imputed values, not the actual values obtained after the initiation of the resc ue 
66
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
 Confidential and Proprietary  66 medication, will be used in the analysis. Further information on imputation of missing data 
methods and sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP.  
The primary endpoint of change from baseline in log e-transformed urine 23S- pentol at the end of 
each DB treatment period will also be analyzed via a mixed effects model. The log e-transformed 
urine 23S- pentol measurements during the DB treatment periods prior to initiating rescue 
medication will serve as the dependent variable. Fixed effects for randomi zed treatment, 
sequence, period, baseline value, nominal time (in days within period; categorical), and randomized treatment-by- time interaction will be included. Random effects for patients will be 
included, for which an unstructured covariance matrix wil l be assumed. If convergence issues 
arise, a first order auto -regressive structure will be used. The REPEATED statement will be used 
to specify the covariance structure associated with the repeated measures. The primary treatment 
effect estimate will be th e contrast between CDCA and placebo randomized treatment -by-time 
evaluated at 4 weeks.  
16.4.2. Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment and the corresponding exact 95% CI will 
be presen
ted for each treatment. Patients who require blinded and/or open-label CDCA during 
the DB periods will be considered to have met the event (ie, received rescue medication) for the 
primary analysis. The difference in proportions, the corresponding exact CI, and exact p- values 
will be calculated and presented using Prescott's method ( Presc
ott 1981 ). This analysis will be 
perfor
med on the FAS.  
Perce
nt change from baseline in plasma cholestanol levels, and plasma 7αC4 and 7α12αC4 
levels at the end of each DB treatment period will  be analyzed in a similar way as for the primary 
endpoint. Since cholestanol is expected to require longer treatment with CDCA to show meaningful changes, the primary analysis for cholestanol will be conducted on the TEFAS to 
mitigate against the potential impact of the shorter treatment duration prior to the DB period. For 
plasma 7αC4, the analysis will be based on the FAS.  
16.4.3. Analysis of Other Secondary Endpoints  
Other continuous efficacy endpoints (such as plasma cholestanol to cholesterol ratio and plasma 
7α12αC4) will be analyzed using the same approach described for percent change in urine 
23S-pentol. Other binary efficacy endpoints (such as incidence of new or worsening CTX- related 
clinical manifestations) will be analyzed using the same approach describ ed for the proportion of 
patients requiring rescue medication.  
The proportion of patients with negative net change in symptoms or manifestations (described below) reported in the diary during the double-blind period is a composite endpoint and will be 
analyzed as a binary efficacy endpoint using the same approach described for the proportion of 
patients requiring rescue medication. For each symptom or manifestation, the value for each planned visit (ie, Day 1 [baseline], Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, for DB1; Day 85 [baseline], Weeks 13, 
14, 15, and 16 for DB2) will be based on the results reported in the diary during the 7 days 
preceding the visit. Data obtained after initiation of rescue treatment will be excluded from the calculations. The following parameter s will contribute to the composite endpoint calculated at 
the planned visits for each patient:  
67
Travere Therapeutics, Inc.  Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)  
Cheno -CTX -301 Protocol Amendment 6  
Confidential and Proprietary  67 •Bowel function:  the proportion of bowel movements with the BSFS scores of 1
(severe constipation), 2 (mild constipation), 6 (mild diarrhea), or 7 (severe diarrh ea);
the average BSFS score of all reported bowel movements
•Seizures:  the rate of seizure per day (ie, total number of seizures/total days with diarydata); the average duration of seizures; the average severity of seizures
•Tremors:  the proportion of days with tremors (ie, number of days with tremors/totaldays with diary data); the average number of body parts with tremors; the averageseverity of all tremors reported
•Individual manifestations:  the proportion of days with the specific manifestation(ie, number of days with manifestation/total days with diary data); the weighted (2  for
most bothersome manifestations, 1 for other manifestations) average impact or
discomfort/distress score (0 to 4, ranging from no impact or discomfort/distress to
very sever e impact or discomfort/distress)
For each pa rameter abov e,
 the change from  baseline score will be  calculated as the difference 
between t
he value for a specific visit during the double- blind peri od and the corresponding 
baselin
e visit ( ie, ba seline – pos tbaseline visit). The sign of the change will be noted as -1, 0, or 
+1 if it is less than 0, equ al to 0, o r  greater than 0,  respective ly. Patients are considered to ha ve a 
negative ne
t change if there are more ne gative changes than p ositive changes. A dditional de tails 
wi
ll be described i n the SAP.
16.5. Control of Type 1 Error 
Multiple
 compar
ison procedures w ill be  impleme nted to strongly c ontrol  the family- wise type 1 
errors across the primary endpoint and the key secondary efficacy endpoints. The first family of 
hypot heses consist s of the analysis of urine 23S-pentol. The second family of hypot heses consist 
of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of proporti on requiring rescue medication, percent 
change from baseline plasma cholestanol, and percent change from base line plasma 7αC4 (in no 
particular order). The schematic of the multiple comparison procedure is presented in  Figure 4.

 Confidential and Proprietary 68 The primary endpoint of urine 23S-pentol will be tested at the fi nal analysis at an α = 0.05. If the 
test is significant, the Family One is rejected and the entire α = 0.05 is preserved and then passed 
onto Family Two of hypotheses (ie,  key secondary endpoints) for te sting at the final analysis. 
Otherwise, there is no remaining α to be passed onto Family Two, and therefore, the key 
secondary endpoints will not be formally tested, and nominal p-values will be reported instead. 
The Bonferroni-Holms procedure will be used to control the Type 1 erro rs for Family Two of 
hypotheses at an overall α = 0.05. 
All other secondary efficacy e ndpoints will be analyzed at the nominal 0.05 significance level.  
16.6. Analysis of Safety Endpoints 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the safety data by randomized treatment group 
among adult cohort patients based on the SAS a nd by administered dose among pediatric cohort 
patients based on the PSAS. 
Clinical laboratory parameters will be meas ured at baseline and postbaseline visits. Each 
continuous laboratory variable wi ll be summarized in terms of changes from baseline by 
treatment group. Laboratory data will  also be classified as low, normal, or high relative to the 
parameter’s reference range. Laboratory abnormalities for e ach treatment will also be 
summarized using shift tables.  
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA by System  Organ Class and Preferred Term. AEs that 
begin after the first administrati on of study medication, or existing AE s that worsen after the first 
dose of study medication, are c onsidered TEAEs. The number a nd percentage of patients 
reporting TEAEs will be summarized for each tr eatment group by MedDRA System Organ Class 
and Preferred Term, by severity, and by rela tionship to study medi cation. The number and 
percentage of patients repor ting serious TEAEs, TEAEs leadi ng to treatment discontinuation, 
and TEAEs of interest (see Section 14.2.4 ) will also be summarized for each treatment group by 
MedDRA System Organ Cl ass and Preferred Term. 
16.7. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics Endpoints 
PK concentration and estimated pa rameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The PK analysis will be the individual analys is for CDCA, gCDCA, tC DCA, and total CDCA 
(summed of CDCA, gCDCA, and tCDCA). PK will be analyzed unadjusted for baseline 
endogenous levels. 
16.8. Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis will be  conducted for this study.

ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guidel ines for Good Clinical Practic e, 1996; ICH Guidelines for 
Safety Data Management, 1994; th e US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 21 Parts 50, 56, and 
312); and the EU Clinical Trials  Directive, 2001/20/EC. The prot ocol meets legal and regulatory 
requirements according to the country of conduct. 
Institutional and Ethics Review 
This protocol and associated Informed Consent Form (ICF), participan t information sheet, any 
information provided to the patient, the Investigator’s Brochure , and any proposed advertising 
material, will be submitted to an  appropriate IRB/IEC, applicable regulatory authorities, and host 
institution(s) for written approval (where applicab le). These documents will also be submitted to, 
and approved by, the above partie s for all amendments to the original approved documents 
(where applicable). Documentation of any appl icable approval(s) and the approved ICF will be 
received by the Sponsor or its designee prior to enrollment of  patients and release of study 
medication. 
17.1. Unblinded Data Monitoring Committee 
An unblinded DMC, including physicians with experience treating patients with CTX, 
physicians trained in neurology, internal medicine, and/or pharmacovigilance, as well as 
statistician(s), will monitor accumulating data, including biomarkers (urine and plasma bile 
alcohols, plasma cholestanol, plasma 7 αC4, and plasma 7α 12αC4). The DMC will review 
efficacy, clinical outcomes, and safety results to potentially stop the study early based on the 
overall benefit-risk assessment , including the risk of irreve rsible disease progression among 
those receiving placebo. The scope of  the DMC’s review will be fu rther defined within the DMC 
Charter. 
DMC members will not be involve d in the study as Investigators or consultants. The DMC will 
have study conduct oversight as defined by th e DMC Charter. All members will have 
considerable experience with cl inical study conduct and DMCs. Any candidate found to have a 
financial, intellectual, or pers onal conflict of interest, or w hose name is listed on the FDA 
debarment list, will not be offered membership. Conflicts of interest will be assessed regularly, 
and if members are found to have a new conflict of interest they will be replaced. 
The DMC will meet approximately every 6 months at scheduled meetings but may agree to 
adjust meeting frequency based upo n actual and projected data ava ilability. In addition, ad hoc 
meetings may be convened, as appropri ate, to review safety data.   
Based on review of available data, the DMC will advise the Sponsor on the validity and 
scientific merit of continuing the study.  
Written minutes of both open and closed DMC sessions will be pr epared. The minutes of closed 
sessions will be made available to the appointed Sponsor designees  only after the database is 
locked and all data  are unblinded. 
The DMC may request unblinded in dividual patient data as appr opriate. Data reviewed during 
the meetings will include, at a minimum, di sposition, demographics, exposure, clinical

medication. At each meeting, detail ed narratives of interval SAEs (including events resulting in 
death) are reviewed by the DMC in addition to a cumulative list of all SAEs. 
All Investigators and re sponsible IRBs/IECs will be inform ed of any decisions made by the 
Sponsor based on recommendations from the DMC relating to pati ent safety that alter the 
conduct of this study. The Investigat ors will inform patients of such  actions, and the protocol and 
ICF will be revised, as appropriate. 
17.2. Changes to the Conduct of the Study or Protocol 
Any changes to the study protocol, such as ch anges in the study design, objectives or endpoints, 
inclusion and exclusion cr iteria, and/or procedures (except to eliminate an immediate hazard)

17.3.1. Patient Informed Consent 
Investigators agree to adhere to GCP, which includes ethical principl es that have their origin in 
the Declaration of Helsinki, when developing th e patient informed consent and assent (where 
applicable) forms and when obtaining consent and assent from the patie nt, parent, or legal 
guardian. Written informed cons ent is required prior to enrollment in the study. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to document the consent process within the source documents 
and obtain consent using an I RB/IEC-approved consent form. 
If necessary because of restrictions related to COVID-19, a patient may provide informed 
consent remotely (ie, via telephone, email, etc.). It is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
document this consent process w ithin the source documents.  
The Investigator will ensure that each patient or  parent or legal guardians (as appropriate) is 
given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risks, 
and benefits of the study as well as  potential treatment a lternatives. Investigators will ensure that 
consent/assent is obtained with the appropriate age range form. For developmentally delayed or 
cognitively impaired patients, Investigators will determine whic h age range assent will be 
appropriate based on the patient's physical and cognitive ability and will document the process of 
determination. Patients or parents or legal guardians (as appropriate) will be notified that they are 
free to discontinue participation in the study at any time and will be given the opportunity to ask 
questions and allowed time to cons ider the informat ion provided.  
17.3.2. Case Report Forms 
Copies of pertinent records in connection with  the study, including all source documents, will be 
made available to the Sponsor or  its designee upon request with due precaution toward protecting 
the privacy of the patient. 
Data will be entered by the site onto the eCRFs in the Electronic Data Capture system or 
downloaded from a device, as in the case of pati ent-reported outcomes, or imported into the 
electronic database as described in  the data management plan and/or data transfer plans. Unless 
explicitly directed, blank data fields are not  acceptable. Any erroneous entries made on the 
eCRFs will be corrected by the site. Changes made to the data after initial entry into the eCRF 
will be captured via an electr onic audit trail and include the reason for change. Incomplete 
entries or entries needing additional explanation will be queried to the site for clarification.

The Investigator is responsible for oversight and maintenance of the study records and patient 
source documents. These records will be read ily available for audit or inspection. 
The Investigator will retain study records for at least 2 years afte r the last marketing approval has 
been granted and there are no pend ing marketing applications in an ICH region, or until at least 
2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical program. However, these 
documents should be retained for a longer period , if required by other applicable requirements 
(eg, applicable local regulatory requirement) or by an agreement with the Sponsor or its 
designee. The Investigator will contact the S ponsor or its designee prior to any record 
destruction. 
Patient records or other source data will be kept for the maximum period of time mandated by 
the hospital, institution, or private practice, but not less than 15 years. 
If off-site archiving is used, all records will be retrieved and made available for review at the 
time of an audit or regul atory authority  inspection. 
17.3.4. Monitoring 
A representative of the Sponsor or its designee wi ll visit the Inve stigator periodically for the 
purpose of monitoring the progress of this study in accordance with the protocol, GCP, and local 
regulations. If necessary, because of restrictions  related to COVID-19, monitoring activities may 
be performed remotely. Further details regarding the scope a nd timing of these remote and 
on-site monitoring activities are included in th e Clinical Monitoring Plan. Non-compliance with 
the protocol, GCP, and local regulations will be  documented and corrective actions implemented, 
if necessary. It is the responsibility of the Inves tigator to be present or available for consultation 
during monitoring visits. During these routine visits, all data pert aining to a patient’s 
participation in this clinical investigation will be made ava ilable to the Study Monitor. The 
Investigator will comply with a pplicable privacy and security laws for use and disclosure of 
information. Study Monitors will perform source document verification acco rding to the Clinical 
Monitoring Plan to ensure consistency between the eCRFs and source documents. Discrepancies 
will be resolved in accordance w ith the principles of GCP. 
At any time prior to, during, or after completion of the clinical study, an audit may be performed 
on a study site by the Sponsor or its designee, an  IRB/IEC, or a representative of a national 
regulatory agency. Investigators will notify the Sponsor or its designee upon notification of 
inspection by a representative of a national regulatory agency. A Sponsor or designee 
representative will be availabl e to assist in the preparati on for study site inspections. All 
pertinent study data will be made available for ve rification, audit, or inspection purposes. 
An Unblinded Study Monitor will be assigned to th e study to perform source data verification of 
biomarker data entered by central laboratory personnel into the IxRS system (ie, blinded rescue medication calculation) and a stan dalone biomarker database. N on-compliance with the testing 
protocols, GCP, and local regulations will be documented and corrective actions implemented, if 
necessary. The Unblinded Study Monitor will have  no other role on the study. Further details

If the Sponsor or its designee, th e Investigator, or regulatory au thorities discover any conditions 
during the study that indicate that the study or study site should be  terminated, this action may be 
taken after appropriate consulta tion between the Sponsor, its desi gnee, and the Investigator. The 
Sponsor has the right to terminate the participation of either an i ndividual site or the study at any 
time, for any reason which may include the following: 
 The incidence and severity of AEs in this or other studies indicat es a potential health 
hazard to patients. 
 Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory. 
 Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete. 
 Investigator(s) do(es) not adhere  to the protocol or applicab le regulatory guidelines in 
conducting this study. 
 Knowingly false information from the study site is subm itted to the Sponsor, its 
designee, or regulat ory authorities. 
In the event that the study is terminated early, the Sponsor or its designee will provide specific 
guidance to study sites regarding the end-of-study procedures. 
17.3.6. Study Medication Control 
The Investigator will acknowledge  that study medication supplies are investigational, and as 
such must be used strictly in accordance with the protocol and only under the supervision of the 
Investigator or Sub-Investigat or(s) listed on Form FDA 1572 (or regional equivalent). Study 
medication must be stored in a safe and secu re place with limited access and according to 
Sponsor instructions. 
The Investigator must maintain adequate record s documenting the receipt  and disposition of all 
study medication supplies. The Sponsor or its de signee will supply forms on which to record the 
date study medication was received and a dispensing record in which to record each patient’s 
use. It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that pa tients return their unused study 
medication. 
17.3.6.1. Receipt of Study Medication 
A proof of receipt, which details the quantity and description of the study medication, will 
accompany the shipment from the Sponsor or its de signee to the Investigator. The Investigator

disclosure of any such information will be obtain ed in writing and is included in the ICF. No 
study data will be disclosed to a third party (wit h the exception of auditors and/or regulatory 
authorities) without the written consent of the Sponsor. A ll data shall be secured against 
unauthorized access. 
The Investigator will maintain a list of patien t names and identifying in formation (eg, patient 
hospital number, unique patien t number). This lis t will not be collected by the Sponsor. 
The written participant information sheet will explai n that study data will be stored in a computer 
database, maintaining confidentiality in accordance with national data protection laws. All data 
that is computer processed by th e Sponsor or designee will be identified only by unique patient 
number/randomization code/pat ient initials/site number. 
When personal patient data are stored in or pro cessed by computer, the data must be protected to 
prevent their disclosure to una uthorized third parties. Pertin ent sections of national data 
protection laws will be complied with in full, according to the country of conduct. 
The ICF will explain that, for data verification purposes, authorized representatives of the 
Sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IEC/IRB may require direct access to parts of the hospital 
or study site records rele vant to the study, including patient medical history.

b PK blood draws will be collected at Visit 5. PK samples will be collected predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 hours postdose . Patients will need to hold the first 
dose of study medication for on-site administration to facilitate the correct timing of the blood draw for the PK analysis. PK samples will only be obtained from 
patients who are on 750 mg (250 mg TID). A standardized low-fat meal will be provided 45-60 minutes prior to the first study me dication dose and should be 
completed within 30 minutes of starting the meal. Predose blood sa mple for plasma PK will be drawn within 15-30 minutes post co mpletion of the meal. After 
the first study medication dose, the 0.5 hours post dose draw ha s a ±5-minute window. The 1, 2, and 3-hour post dose draws have  a ±10-minute window. An 
optional small snack may be offered and completed within 30 minutes of the post 3-hour timepoint. The 6-hour post dose draw has  a ±15-minute window. A 
second standardized low-fat meal is provided 45 to 60 minutes prior to the 8-hour timepoint and the meal will be completed with in 30 minutes of starting the 
meal. The 8-hour PK draw will be taken 15-30 minutes after the completion of the meal. 
c If open-label rescue medication criteria are triggered prior to Vi sits 10 or 18, all assessments must be conducted prior to ad ministration of open-label treatment. 
d If prior genetic confirmation of CTX is not available, blood will be drawn at Visit 1 for gene sequencing. No patient with neg ative genetic sequencing will be 
randomized. 
e CTX medical history should include a complete list of CTX-related symptoms present at the time of Screening. 
f Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at Screening for WOCBP. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at all other visits. A  positive urine pregnancy test 
will be confirmed by a serum test. All WOCBP must have a negativ e pregnancy test (urine, with positive results confirmed by ser um) at every visit. 
g The CGI-C needs to be completed at this visit if a patient leaves the study early during DB1 or DB2. 
h Ophthalmology exam includes BCVA and catar acts. The ophthalmology exam has a window of ±1 day to accommodate being conducted b y a separate 
specialist. 
i At Screening, the physical examination is a full physical examin ation; at subsequent visits, the physical examination can be a n abbreviated exam. Height will 
be measured at Screening, baseline (Visit 6/Day 1), and EOS for adult cohort patients. Physical examinations will include asses sment of the following body 
systems: abdomen; cardiovascular; ear, nose, and throat; eyes; hair and skin; lymph nodes; mental status; musculoskeletal; neur ological; and respiratory. 
j The Investigator will assess if a patient requires OL rescue medi cation at each visit of a DB period including Visits 10 and 1 8 when OL medication is dispensed 
per protocol. If OL rescue medication is required, the Investigator must complete and submit a Clinical Progression Requiring R escue Form ( Appendix 5 ). If 
OL rescue medication is not required, the rescue form must be submitted at the completion of each DB period (ie, Visit 10 and V isit 18). 
k Vital signs will always be measured prior to having blood drawn for laboratory evaluations. 
l All adult cohort patients (regar dless of their history of CDCA use) and/or their parent/legal guardian will be asked to comple te the daily and per-event PRO 
diaries for bowel function and seizures during the 7 days prior to Visit 4 (OL1), Visit 6 (DB1),  Visit 14 (DB2), and throughout the duration of each double-
blind period. Reminders regarding the completion of the PRO diary will be sent to patients and/or patient’s parent/legal guardi an at times specified in the Study 
Manual. Diaries will be reviewed for compli ance at each visit that it is required. If the review of the PRO diary indicates tha t the patient or the patient’s 
parent/legal guardian is not sufficiently compliant with completion of the diary as described in the Study Manual, the patient or the patient’s parent/legal 
guardian will be retrained on how to complete the diary. 
m Distribution and training on use of diary only. 
n Patients who are treatment-naïve or have been treated with CDCA for ≤2 months prior to Screening will also complete the daily and per-event PRO diaries for 
bowel function and seizures during the 7 days prior to Visit 3 an d Visit 5 (OL1).  Diaries will al so be reviewed for compliance  at these visits. 
o First morning void on 3 mornings within 5 days prior to the vi sit will be collected and brought to the site visit. For the Screening visit, the patient may bring 
these urine samples to the site after the Screening visit and before the first day of the OL1 period.

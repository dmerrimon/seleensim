WHO WILL BE MY DOCTOR ON THIS STUDY?
If you decide to participate, Dr. Armstrong or one of his colleagues will be your doctor for the study and 
will be in contact with your regular health care provider throughout the time that you are in the study 
and afterwards, if needed.CONCISE SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a drug called avelumab in men 
with neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Participants will undergo a screening period that includes a 
physical exam, imaging scans, blood draws, and collection of archival tumor tissue.  Once screening 
is complete, participants will come to the clinic to receive the study drug avelumab by IV infusion 
every 2 weeks. 
During some or all of the clinic visits, participants will also be asked to complete medical exams, 
answer questions about any medications or adverse events, have routine imaging scans, have blood 
drawn for routine tests and research tests, and complete quality of life questionnaires. Participants 
will also be asked for permission undergo a tumor biopsy and donate some tissue to research when 
their cancer worsens. Participants will return to clinic 28 days after the last dose of avelumab and 
then be followed every 3 months for up to 3 years.
The risks for the study drug are described in this document. Some risks include: feeling tired and 
reactions that occur during or following the infusion which may include allergic reactions, chills, 
fever, muscle pain, shortness of breath, and low or high blood pressure.

WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a drug called avelumab in men with 
neuroendocrine prostate cancer. This study will investigate how neuroendocrine prostate cancer 
responds to this drug and what side effects subjects experience.  This study will also look different 
biomarkers to gain a better understanding of how avelumab affects your cancer and immune system. 
Biomarkers include such things as the proteins involved in tumor growth and immune system activation, 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as well as changes in your DNA. Your genes are made up of DNA. DNA 
is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. A gene, or DNA, contains information that determines in part the 
traits, such as eye color, height, or disease risk, that are passed on from parent to child. This study will 
determine the effect that avelumab has on these biomarkers and your tumors, both before and during the 
time you receive avelumab by obtaining blood samples, as well as biopsy samples.
Avelumab is an antibody (a large, Y-shaped protein used by your body's immune system to identify and 
neutralize foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, and tumor cells) that affects your immune system 
by specifically targeting and blocking PD-L1. The PD-L1 pathway is involved in decreasing your 
body’s natural immune response to fight cancer.  By blocking PD-L1, avelumab may help your immune 
system stop, slow or reverse the growth of tumors. Avelumab has been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, but it has not been approved 
for the treatment of neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Therefore, its use in this study is investigational.  
The word “investigational” means this is still being tested in research studies and is not approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
This study will take place in 2 stages. If more than 1 subject in stage 1 shows a response to the study 
drug, then more subjects will be enrolled in stage 2. 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Approximately 23 people will take part in Stage 1 of this study at Duke and approximately 70 people 
will take part in both stages of this study across different hospitals and medical facilities. 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form.  Before you begin the study, 
you will need to undergo the following tests or procedures to find out if you are eligible.  Some of these 
tests or procedures may be part of your regular medical care and may be done even if you do not take 
part in the study.  If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.
Physical exam  including measurement of your weight, height and vital signs
Complete medical history including review of prior and current medications that you are taking 
Performance status to evaluate how you are able to perform normal activities on a daily basis

Collection of blood samples (about 3 tablespoons) for routine laboratory tests (including blood 
cell counts, blood chemistry, and thyroid function), tests to measure your prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) level and testosterone level, and tests to measure tumor markers (CEA and 
chromogranin A) 
Urinalysis:  Your urine will be collected to check for signs of infection, blood, protein or sugar 
in your urine.
Pathology review: You will be required to submit archival tumor tissue
Tumor imaging: Your doctor will assess the status of your cancer with standard imaging 
techniques. These may include a bone scan and a CT/MRI of your chest, abdomen and pelvis, or 
a PET/CT scan.
oAll sites of your cancer will be scanned using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI).  A CT scan is a type of X-ray that takes images of your body 
with use of a small amount of radiation.  An MRI is a scan that uses radio waves 
and a strong magnetic field to provide images of internal organs and tissues.  The tumor 
assessment will include a scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  A CT scan of your 
neck may also be performed if your doctor determines that it is necessary to do so.  A 
bone scan will be done to evaluate the sites where your cancer has spread to the bone.
oIf your study doctor determines it is necessary, you will also have a MRI scan of your 
brain 
If eligible to participate, you will be enrolled onto the study and will begin the study visits described 
below.
Active On-Study Phase
During this part of the study, your study doctor will determine if you will continue receiving your 
standard of care treatment of androgen deprivation therapy and/or enzalutamide.
You will also begin receiving intravenous (IV) administration (using a needle placed into your vein) of 
the study drug avelumab every 2 weeks. One cycle lasts 4 weeks so you will receive 2 infusions per 
cycle.
Your doctor may prescribe you steroids or cromolyn to take prior to avelumab. These medications may 
reduce your risk of side effects, such as allergic reactions, while you are being give the avelumab. They 
may be taken by mouth (such as dexamethasone or cromolyn) or inhaled (such as cromolyn). Your 
doctor will tell you if taking pre-medications is appropriate for you.
In addition to the procedures listed below, you will have a bone scan and CT/MRI or a PET/CT scan 
every 8 weeks while you are receiving the study drug, which is the standard of care for evaluating your

Optional post-progression biopsy: 
Your study doctor may determine that you will undergo a standard of care biopsy after your cancer 
progresses, meaning you would have the biopsy whether or not you participate in this study. The biopsy 
tissue may be taken from, but is not limited to, one of the following locations:
Bone marrow 
Lymph nodes
Liver
Lung
Adrenal gland
If you are having a standard of care biopsy, we would like to collect additional tissue for future research 
tests, including but not limited to genetic sequencing and tests for biomarkers, that will help the 
researchers learn more about the effect that avelumab has on your cancer and your immune system. In 
addition, you will be asked for permission to store tissue in the Duke Biospecimen Repository and 
Processing Core for future research through a separate consent form. Your study nurse will explain the 
details to you. If you do not want to have this biopsy or you do not want your tissue to be used for the 
research described in this consent form you will still be able to participate in the main clinical trial.

Even without your name or other identifiers, your genetic information is unique to you. There is a 
potential risk that someone will identify you from your genetic information or learn something about 
you by looking at your genetic information; this risk may increase in the future as technologies advance 
and as more researchers study your genetic information.  These risks may also affect members of your 
family.  You should discuss your participation in this study with your family and ask the study doctor 
about any questions or concerns you may have. 
Your samples and genetic information may be used for research for many years in the future.
We will protect your privacy and confidential information by labeling your samples and genetic 
information only with a code number.  Researchers outside of Duke University will not be given a link 
between the code number and your name or any other identifying information.  While we hope this will 
prevent any potential loss of privacy or confidentiality, we cannot make any guarantees.
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?
You will continue to receive the study drug as long as you receive clinical benefit. This means you may 
also have the option to continue receiving the study drug even if your PSA level rises or your cancer 
appears to grow on imaging scans. Your study doctor will discuss this option with you in more detail. 
When you stop receiving the study drug, you will continue to be followed every 3 months (up to 3 years) 
for survival.
You can choose to stop participating at any time without penalty or loss of any benefits to which you are 
entitled. However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, we encourage you to talk to your 
doctor first.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?
Participation in a clinical trial is associated with some risks, which may include things that could make 
you feel unwell, uncomfortable, or harm you. You might have side effects related to the study drug 
while taking part in the study. Every patient taking part in the study will be closely watched for any side 
effects; however, the study team does not know all the effects that the study drug may have on you. 
These side effects may be mild or severe. In some cases, these effects might be long lasting, or 
permanent, and may be life threatening or in rare cases could result in death. Please refer to your study

doctor if you want to have more details on each side effect (such as expected duration, or severity). The 
clinical study team may give you medicines to help reduce side effects. If any of these side effects occur, 
you must inform your study doctor immediately.
Risks associated with avelumab
The following side effects (considered related to study drug) have been observed in
1738 subjects who received avelumab according to the results from one oncology clinical study.
Observed in at least 10% of subjects (10 out of 100)
Reactions (including allergic reactions) that occur during or following infusion (may include 
chills, fever, muscle pain, shortness of breath, low or high blood pressure)
Tiredness
Observed in 2-9% of subjects (2-9 out of 100)
Nausea
Diarrhea
Chills
Reduced appetite
Joint pain
Fever
Reduced function of the thyroid gland
Itchy skin
Vomiting
Flu-like symptoms (including body aches, fever, and chills)
Skin rash
Increased blood levels of liver enzymes
Muscle pain
Headache
Loss of energy
 
Reactions (including allergic reactions) that occur during or following the infusion (may include chills, 
fever, muscle pain, shortness of breath, and decrease or increase in blood pressure) are mostly mild or 
moderate and should resolve with a slowdown or discontinuation of the infusion and administration of 
medications to control the symptoms such as anti-allergic and pain-killer drugs. In some cases these 
reactions may be severe (less than 1% of subjects (1 out of 100)) and could require intensive medical 
support and even life threatening reactions may occur. During the infusion you will be observed closely 
for signs of an infusion reaction. The drug will be given slowly and you will also be monitored for signs 
of an infusion reaction for a period of time after the infusion is completed.

You may be given drugs to reduce infusion-related reactions (side effects that occur during or following 
infusion) 30 to 60 minutes prior to receiving avelumab. These drugs may include, but are not limited to, 
antihistamines, paracetamol, steroids or cromolyn. Your study doctor or nurse will discuss which drugs 
you will receive and any potential side-effects.
Side effects resulting from an increased activity of the immune system have also been observed. Most of 
these side effects are reversible, which means they will stop once avelumab is discontinued, however in 
some cases these reactions may be severe (approximately 2% of subjects (2 out of 100)) and could lead 
to death in rare cases. The reactions that are more severe may require treatment with drugs that decrease 
the immune system function, also called immunosuppressant drugs (like corticosteroids or more potent 
drugs, such as infliximab).
The side effects resulting from an increased activity of the immune system that were observed in 
subjects receiving avelumab include the following:
Observed in at least 5% of subjects (at least 5 out of 100):
Inflammation of the thyroid gland (could include high or low function of the thyroid gland)
Inflammation of the skin (could include skin rash, itchy skin, redness or blisters)
Observed in 1-5% of subjects (1-5 out of 100):
Inflammation of the large intestine (colitis)
Inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis)
Observed in less than 1% of subjects (less than 1 out of 100):
Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)
Decreased function of the adrenal gland (adrenal insufficiency)
Inflammation of the muscles (myositis)
Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis)
Inflammation of the eyes (uveitis)
You may be given drugs to reduce infusion-related reactions (side effects that occur during or following 
infusion) 30 to 60 minutes prior to receiving avelumab. These drugs may include, but are not limited to, 
antihistamines, paracetamol (Tylenol), steroids or cromolyn. 
Risks of antihistamines
The most common risks associated with antihistamines are:
Dizziness
Dry mouth, nose or throat
Loss of coordination
Sleepiness

dose of study drug. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as a 
vasectomy), or (2) a condom used with a spermicide.  Contraceptive measures such as Plan B (TM), sold 
for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. You should inform 
your partner of the potential for harm to an unborn child.  She should know that if pregnancy occurs, 
you will need to report it to the study doctor, and she should promptly notify her doctor. The study 
doctor will ask if your partner is willing to provide updates on the progress of the pregnancy and its 
outcome. If your partner agrees, this information will be provided to Pfizer, Inc. for safety monitoring 
follow-up.
Risks of biopsy:
If you are already having a biopsy that is part of the regular care for your condition, obtaining additional 
tissue will increase the duration of your procedure. This may lead to a small increase in the chance that 
you will have an adverse event due to the procedure being performed. 
The risks of the procedure will depend on the location of the site for biopsy. Biopsies will be performed 
by a radiologist under radiographic guidance. You will receive local anesthesia (numbing medication).  
Mild sedation in your vein may be given in some circumstances.  The risks of sedation include an 
allergic reaction, aspiration (fluid going into the lungs), and over sedation.  In addition, the IV used may 
cause a bruise. Rarely, an infection develops at the IV site. When the numbing medication is given, you 
may initially feel a burning sensation in your skin for several seconds. During the procedure, you may 
temporarily feel pressure and/or pain of varying degrees. If necessary, you may ask your physician for 
additional local anesthesia or a medication to ease your stress.  You also may experience bleeding and/or 
bruising after the procedure is completed, and you may experience soreness in the area for a few days 
afterwards.  Rarely, infection can develop. If you have concerns about the overall risk of your biopsy, 
you should discuss them with your physician.
Risks of Radiation: 
You will have a number of CT scans, nuclear scans and MRI scans that are part of the regular care for 
your condition, and you would have them whether or not you participate in this research. These studies 
will not add to the risk of the research. If you take part in this research and undergo a CT guided biopsy 
that is part of the regular care for your condition, then these studies will not add to the risk of the 
research. However, if you have concerns about the overall radiation exposure or MRI safety issues, you 
should discuss them with your physician.
Risks of Drawing Blood: 
Risks associated with drawing blood from your arm include momentary discomfort and/or bruising.  
Infection, excess bleeding, clotting, or fainting are also possible, although unlikely.
Drug and Food Interactions: 
For your safety, you must tell the study doctor or nurse about all the prescribed medical foods and drugs, 
herbal products, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, vitamins, natural remedies, and alcohol that you are

taking before you start the study and before starting to take any of these products while you are on the 
study.
There may be risks, discomforts, drug interactions or side effects that are not yet known.
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?
There is no guarantee that you will receive any direct medical benefits from this study. If the study drug 
is effective and safe, it may help your immune system stop, slow or reverse the growth of tumors.  
Your overall health may improve, stay the same, or even worsen while on this study.  Information from 
this study may help doctors learn more about avelumab and the treatment of neuroendocrine prostate 
cancer.  This information may benefit other patients with prostate cancer or a similar condition in the 
future.
WHAT ALTERNATIVES ARE THERE TO PARTICIPATION IN THIS STUDY?
If you decide not to take part in this study, other approved treatments are available to you, which the 
study doctor will explain to you.  You may receive treatment to control the symptoms you may be 
having as a result of your disease.  Other options may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. You 
may also choose to have no treatment for your cancer; receiving only palliative care to manage your 
symptoms and make you feel more comfortable. Study staff will discuss these alternative treatments and 
the risks and benefits associated with these treatments with you before you take part in this study.
Please talk to your doctor about these and perhaps other options.
WILL MY INFORMATION BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL?
Participation in research involves some loss of privacy. We will do our best to make sure that 
information about you is kept confidential, but we cannot guarantee total confidentiality. Your personal 
information may be viewed by individuals involved in this research and may be seen by people 
including those collaborating, funding, and regulating the study. We will share only the minimum 
necessary information in order to conduct the research. Your personal information may also be given out 
if required by law.
In addition, your records may be reviewed in order to meet federal or state regulations. Reviewers may 
include representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, representatives of Pfizer, 
representatives of the Duke Cancer Institute, the Duke Office of Audit, Risk, and Compliance, the Duke 
University Health System Institutional Review Board, and others as appropriate. If any of these groups 
review your research record, they may also need to review your entire medical record. If this 
information is disclosed to outside reviewers for audit purposes, it may be further disclosed by them and 
may not be covered by federal privacy regulations.
Duke is participating in this study along with other member institutions of the Prostate Cancer Clinical 
Trial Consortium (PCCTC).  As part of their reporting requirements, we will report to the PCCTC the

following information about all subjects that we enroll on this study: subject ID, consent date, race, and 
ethnicity. 
As part of this study, you will be asked to have certain tests and/or procedures performed. Some of these 
tests and/or procedures would have been done as part of your regular care. The study doctor will use 
these test results both to treat you and to complete this research.  These test results will be recorded in 
your medical record and will be reported to the research data office at Duke. Some information collected 
about you only for this research study may be kept in a research study record separate from your medical 
record, and some research information may also be part of your medical record.  You will not have 
access to this research information until the end of the study.  However, it will be available to your 
physicians if needed for your care.
The study results will be retained in your research record for at least six years after the study is 
completed.  At that time either the research information not already in your medical record may be 
destroyed or information identifying you will be removed from such study results at DUHS.  Any 
research information in your medical record will be kept indefinitely.
While the information and data resulting from this study may be presented at scientific meetings or 
published in a scientific journal, your identity will not be revealed.
Some people or groups who receive your health information might not have to follow the same privacy 
rules. Once your information is shared outside of DUHS, we cannot guarantee that it will remain private. 
If you decide to share private information with anyone not involved in the study, the federal law 
designed to protect your health information privacy may no longer apply to the information you have 
shared.  Other laws may or may not protect sharing of private health information.
WHAT ARE THE COSTS?
You or your insurance provider will be responsible and billed for all costs related to your routine 
medical care, including copayments and deductibles. Routine medical care services include assessments, 
laboratory and provider visits that you would have received for your condition if you were not 
participating in this research study. Not all services are covered by insurance.  Some procedures or scans 
may require pre-authorization by your insurance plan. We will notify you if we learn that a service is not 
covered by your insurance plan as part of the pre-authorization process. If it is not covered, you will be 
responsible for paying for it.  The amount of your out-of-pocket expense will depend on your insurance 
plan.  For beneficiaries with Medicare Advantage Plans, traditional Medicare is billed for the routine 
cost of a research study.  You may have more or higher co-pays than with a Medicare Advantage plan.  
Please discuss the costs of the study with your study doctor.  At your request, a Financial Counselor in 
the clinic may provide you with an estimate of costs for routine services.

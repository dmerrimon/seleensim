[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
Title:  WISE LE: Evaluation of WIRION™ EPS in Lower Extremities Arteries     
Study Objective  Demonstrate the safety and performance of the WIRION™ EPS in subjects 
undergoing lower extremity atherectomy for the treatment of Peripheral 
Arterial Disease (PAD).   
Study Design  Prospective, multi -center, non -randomized, open label, single arm study. Up 
to 153 consented subjects who undergo atherectomy due to lower limb PAD 
will be enrolled. All subjects will undergo baseline assessment, intervention 
(atherectomy in conjunction with WIRIONTM EPS) and post procedure follow 
up. All subjects will have a follow up visit at 30±7 days post procedure. 
Results will be compared to a performance goal based on an analysis of 
previous trials that studied atherectomy with an embolic protection filter in 
similar patient cohorts.  
Study Population : Both male and female subjects who meet all the eligibility criteria and give 
written informed consent will be enrolled in the study.

Number of 
subjects:   Up to 153 with an interim analysis after 100 subjects  
Clinical sites:  Up to 10 sites ; up to 1/3 of the study patients at OUS sites  
Investigational 
Product:  WIRION™ Embolic Protection System (Gardia Medical Ltd.)  
Primary end 
point  Freedom from major adverse events (MAE) to 30 days post procedure.  
MAE defined as a serious adverse event that results in death, acute myocardial 
infarction, thrombosis, pseudo -aneurysm, dissection (grade C or greater) or 
clinical perfora tion at the filter location, distal embolism (clinically relevant), 
unplanned amputation, or clinically -driven target vessel revascularization 
(TVR), through 30 days post -procedure, as adjudicated by the Clinical Events 
Committee (CEC).  
Secondary end 
poin ts • Device success  
Defined as:  
- A successful delivery and deployment of WIRION™  distal to the 
intervention site without complications, AND  
- Successful retrieval of WIRION™ following completion of the stenting 
procedure, without complications  
• Clinical success  
Defined as: Device success with freedom from procedure related 
serious adverse events ascribed to the WIRION  
• Technical success   
Defined as:  Freedom from device malfunctioning causing the 
procedure to be aborted  
• Percent of filters with visible debris  
Assessment 
Schedule:  Baseline Visit:  
a) Eligibility according to inclusion and exclusion criteria  
b) Obtaining signed Informed Consent Form (ICF)  
c) Demographics (sex, year of birth, smoking status)  
d) Risk factors & medical history  
e) Concomitant medications  
f) Disease oriented physical examination including vital signs (weight, 
height, BMI, heart rate, blood pressure) and ABI (except in cases

INR, serum creatine -kinase isoform MB (CK -MB) and serum creatinine  
h) Pregnancy test, if applicable

Statistical 
Considerations:  A performance goal  group sequential design with a maximum of two stages 
with rejection boundaries according to Lan -DeMets  alpha spending function 
with O’Brien - Fleming boundaries. The expected proportion of subjects who 
would meet the primary endpoint if treated according to current clinical 
practice is 10.7%. This performance goal is based on the DEFINITVE LE and 
DEFINITVE Ca++ trials.  
The study is designed to test the primary null hypothesis that the 30 -day MAE 
outcome using the WIRIONTM EPS in conjunction with atherectomy is equal to 
or higher than the PG of 19.26%, as opposed to the alternative hypothesis 
that the MAE is  less than this PG. An interim analysis will be carried out when

 100 (68.5%) of the originally planned subjects have reached the 30 -day 
follow -up. Using an Exact Binomial Test and under the following assumptions:  
Alpha (one -sided) =  0.025  
β=   0.20  
PE=   10.7%  
Performance goal=  19.26%  
An estimated 145 evaluable subjects will be required for 80% power if the 
study reaches the final analysis. With an anticipated combined loss -to-follow -
up of up to 5%, 153 patients will be enrolled in the study.  
An interim an alysis will be performed when 100 subjects (approximately 
68.5% of the 145 evaluable subjects) have completed the study; two 
potential options will be pursued:  
The study will be stopped for efficacy if the primary null hypothesis is 
rejected at one sided alpha = 0.0068 based on the Lan -DeMets alpha 
spending function with O’Brien - Fleming boundaries.  
If based on the interim analysis the primary null hypothesis cannot be 
rejected, then the trial will continue to a total sample size of 153 enrolled 
subjects (i.e., 145 evaluable subjects). This test will be conducted at one -
sided alpha = 0.0229, in order to control the overall Type I error at 2.5%.  
Study success is defined as rejecting the null hypothesis.  
Duration of Study   The estimated study duration is ten months, including a recruitment phase 
and follow up period of 30±7  days

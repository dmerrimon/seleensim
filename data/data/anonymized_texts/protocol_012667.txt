The present 
approaches to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are 
limited and for some patients there are significant drawbacks that have not been resolved. 
It would be desirable to provide a source of relief for constipation that would permit 
dosing adjustments to optimize efficacy and safety and that would be pleasant to consume 
to improve patient compliance. The treatment should not have the safety issues associated 
with oral phosphate la
xatives, have an acceptable safety profile, and be effective in 
numerous types of constipation. 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc. is investigating the use of a new chemical composition, 
BLI400 (La
ctitol Monohydrate NF Powder for Reconstitution) as a treatment for adult 
constipation.  Ample published literature with lactitol provides significant preclinical and 
clinical studies which support the safe and effective use of this GRAS-listed compound.  
These reports indicate that the BLI400 lactitol composition has promise as a candidate for 
further development for the treatment of constipation, as reviewed herein. 
BLI400 is a member of the pharmaceutica l class of osmotic laxative s; specifically it is a 
non-absorbe d, colonically metabolized suga r alcohol (poly ol). Studi es reviewed here 
indicate it provides relief from the symptoms of constipation by rapidly inducing a 
patient-controlled bowe l movement. While lactitol appears to be minimally, if at all, 
absorbed in the small intestine,  colonic microbes split lactitol into D-galactose and D-
sorbitol, which are fermentable to organic acids including lactic, formic, propionic, 
butyric and acetic acids (as reviewed in Patil et al, 1987 ).  The osmotic properties of the 
small organic molecules consistently point to their pharmacodynamic effects as dependent 
on water retention with the stool.  Thus, BLI400 is a pro-drug of an essentially non-
absorbed osmotic laxative . Lactitol is generally considered to be pharmacologically inert 
and is ofte
n referred to as a “prebiotic” with no specific receptor targets for its laxative 
action.  
Rationale for
 Performing Research with the Investigational Product 
Lactitol monohydrate, at a daily dose of 21 grams per day appears to be a safe and 
effective treatment for constipation, but it has not been studied and proven in clinical 
BLI400 (NDA 211281)

convert it into osmotically active small molecules. Extensive published and non-published 
literature supports its safety and efficacy, but a Phase III clinical trial is required for its 
registra
tion in the US.  It is envisaged there will be one, multi-site, controlled stud y in 
patients wi
th documented constipation and that the design will be similar to other studies 
that have led to the approval of laxatives, such as those for MiraLAX, NDA 22-015 and 
consistent wit
h FDA’s recommendations for study endpoints in CIC trials.  
 
Physical, Che
mical, and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation 
Lactitol is a simple monosaccharide sugar alcohol, a synthetic derivative of the milk sugar 
lactose that was discovered in the 1920s.  It is a dry, free flowing powder, readily soluble 
in aqueous soluti
ons.  As shown by the structure diagrams, it is an analog of the 
disaccharide lactulose.

Version dated 4-13-2016   Page 7 of 35 Nonclinical Studies:  Extensive nonclinical studies have been performed with lactitol as 
support for its reg
istration and marketing in countries outside the US and are reviewed in 
detail in the
 BLI400 Investigators’ Brochure.  The studies have covered basic 
pharmac
ology, genotoxicity and mutagenicity, acute and chronic studies including 
carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity.  These studies were carried out in mice, rats, 
dogs and rabbits. 
 
Pharmacology:  Lactitol is not degraded by the galactosidase enzymes of the small 
intestine However, colonic microflora degrade lactitol extensively in rats so that lactitol 
elevated the proportions of acetic acid and lowered proportions of butyric acid in the 
hindgut of rats. The osmotic effects of these organic acids appear to provide the 
pharmacodynamic basis for lactitol’s laxative action. Increased output of moist feces was 
seen in all animals species studied in a dose-related manner. The highest doses tested 
caused frank diarrhea in some studies. 
Metabolic Effects:  In some studies, total serum cholesterol and triglycerides were 
reduced equally in rats fed diets containing 7% sorbitol or lactitol.  By acidifying fecal 
contents, la
ctitol lower ed ammonia levels in animal models of hepatic encephalopathy, 
perhaps 
as a result of production of the poorly absorbed ammonium ion that follows 
lowering the cecal pH. Rats fed a diet containing 5% of lactitol for two weeks displayed a 
significa
nt increase of calcium absorption.  
Toxicology Studies:  Only weak edema ensued after lactitol application to intact skin, but 
ery
thema and edema emerged when it was applied to abraded skin. Rodents treated with 
lactitol had loose , frequent stools and cecal enlargement. This was often accompanied by 
decre
ased weight gain and increased water consumption. Clinical chemistry changes 
included changes in electrolyte levels, decreased cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase. 
Perhaps as compensation for the electrolyte changes that probably followed the diarrhea, 
adrenal weight and hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata were seen in the highest dose 
groups.  Renal tubular degeneration with nephrocalcinosis was occasionally seen and may 
follow the increased calcium absorption. Lactitol was not considered positive for 
mutagenicity or chromosomal damage studied in standard in vitro and in vivo assays. 
Life-long carcinogenicity studies have indicated that Leydig cell dysplasia occurred in

Version dated 4-13-2016   Page 8 of 35 rats at high lactitol doses, but this was not seen in mice dosed for 24 months or dogs 
dosed for 12 months. This species-specific effect in some rat strains was not considered 
significant to humans, since ordinary milk sugar, lactose, produces a similar effect in 
rodents.  
Clinical Phar
macology and Safety:  Since lactitol is extensively degraded to organic 
acids i
n the colon, it is little surprise that there are no published studies on its level in 
blood after administration.  Some have estimated that only 0.6% of an oral dose of lactitol 
is excreted in urine. Similar to what is found in animals, lactitol is extensively 
metaboliz
ed in the human colon, making available a significant proportion of the 
metabolites for colonic absorption. Unlike in animals, lactitol does not seem to stimulate 
calcium absor
ption in humans, although in one study when 15 g of lactitol was 
administered along with calcium in solution to fasting volunteers, calcium absorption was 
diminished.  Administering lactitol increases fecal Bifidobacteria levels, while other 
bacteria 
(fecal anaerobes, aerobes, Enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli) were unaffected. 
After the ingestion of 25 g lactitol, xylitol, or glucose by eight healthy male volunteers the 
rise in plasma glucose was significantly greater 30 and 60 minutes after ingestion of 
glucose while no rise in plasma glucose followed ingestion of lactitol.  
The investigation of the use of a mixture of lactitol for the treatment of constipation has been 
extensively studied, but the information is only available in published form. From these 
observations, it appears that lactitol’s adverse events are limited largely to the gastrointestinal 
system. Symptoms such as nausea, cramps, abdominal pain, flatulence and vomiting may be 
expected and could lead to withdrawal from the study if not controlled.  Their incidence and 
severity may be ameliorated in some patients by dose-adjustment.  Changes in hematology, 
clinica
l chemistry or urinalysis may be seen, and their clinical significance will be assessed 
during the development of lactitol.  In one study plasma potassium was elevated with lactitol, 
but the values stayed within the normal range. 
Clinical Efficacy:  Lactitol has been marketed since at least 1985 outside the US in 
Europe and other regions (where it is known as Lactitol Ex-Lax® or Importal®, for 
example) as a syrup or powder for the treatment of constipation in adults, including the 
elderly and children.  As a result a substantial body of evidence has accumulated on its

including two recent review articles (Maydeo, 2010; Faruqui and Joshi, 2012). 
A minimal effe
ctive dose of 0.25 g/kg has been suggested, and most studies have found 
that a starting dose of 20 g of lactitol is effective and produces minimal side effects.  
Some studies that have allowed the subjects to make dosage increases to achieve relief of 
constipation symptoms and dose reductions to minimize side effects have indicated that 
this strategy can optimize therapy.  
Maydeo (2010) presented a systematic review of six published randomized, non-
randomized and open trials comparing the safety and efficacy of lactitol to those of 
lactulose. Overall, lactitol was compara ble to lactu lose in efficacy measures (normal stool 
consistency and number of bowel movement pe r week). Patients found lactitol to be more 
acceptable and were more compliant with it l argely due to its superior palatability (73.2 % 
vs. 26.8 %) . Lactitol was signific antly better than lactulose in the frequency of adverse 
events (31.2 ± 0.8 % vs. 62.1 ±1.1 %, p= 0.0019). The physicians’ assessment favored 
lactitol as compared to lactulose (61.91% vs. 47.83%).  The following table is adapted 
from Maydeo’s summary of the reviewed trials.

 evaluate the safety of chronic use of BLI 400 laxative in constipated adults. 
 
3. STUDY PLAN 
3.1. S
tudy Design 
This is a
n open-label, multi-center study in which constipated subjects will receive 
BLI400 for 12 months. 
3.2. Number of Subjects 
Approximately 300 constipated subjects will be enrolled into  this study, including 
approxim
ately 100 elderly subjects (> 65 years of age at Visit 1).  
3.3. Duration of Study  
Qualifying subjects will receive BLI400 at Visit 1 and will begin a 12-month Treatment 
Period. Subjec
ts will return for clinic visits at  the end of Months 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12. A 
follow up call
 will take place 2 weeks after the end of treatment. A completed subject is 
defined as 
a subject that completes the Visit 6 (Month 12) visit.  
 
3.4. Study Treatments 
 
BLI400 Laxative 
BLI400 laxative will be provided polyethylene bottles containing sufficient study 
medicati
on for 30 days of dosing.  The bottles will be equipped with a cap that can be 
used to me
asure 10.5 grams of BLI400.  Each bottle will also have a clinical label 
containing a
 caution statement, study code, study sponsor and subject number. Subjects 
will be instruc
ted to mix the contents of 2 capfuls (approximately 21 g) in 4 - 8 oz of juice  
or other bev
erage, and take once daily preferably in the morning. Subjects that develop 
persiste
nt diarrhea or loose stools will be allowed to adjust their dose down to 10.5g (1 
capful) per day.

Rescue Bisacodyl 
Subjects will be dispensed bisacodyl at each study visit (previously dispensed bisacodyl 
may be
 redispensed if needed, although this is not encouraged). Subjects will be instructed 
to take 5 
– 10mg (1 – 2 tablets) of bisacodyl if they are experiencing severe discomfort 
due to the
ir constipation, or have not had a BM in 4 days. No more than 6 tablets (30mg) 
of bisacodyl should be taken in a week.  
 
If a subject does not have a bowel movement within 24 hours of taking a bisacodyl dose, a 
second dose should be taken. If after the second bisacodyl dose the subject does not have a 
BM within 24 hours, the subject should contact the site. The investigator should then 
consider having the subject return for an evaluation and/or discontinuing the subject from 
the study. 
 
All study medication is required to remain at room temperature 20°-25°C (68°-77°F); 
excursions pe
rmitted between 15°-30°C (59°-86°F).

Study procedures are described as follows and depicted graphically in Section 4.3, below. 
Acce
ptable deviations from the visit schedule are indicated.  These variations must not be 
cumulative; i.e. visits should always be scheduled in relationship to Visit 1 (Day 0). 
4.1. Visit 1 (Day 0) 
At the scree
ning visit, the
 following procedures will be undertaken: 
Subject is fully informed about the study and gives written agreement to study
participation in the form of a signed informed consent form (refer to Section 4.1.1 )
Assess eligibility (refer to inclusion/exclusion criteria )
Review of medications
Medical history including history of constipation (ROME criteria –  See Inclusion #2)
Physical examination
Vital signs, including assessment of orthostatic hypotension ( while seated a nd after
standing for a minimum of 2 minutes) including height and bodyweight , pulse and
temperature
A 12-lead ECG will be performed by qualified, trained site personnel.   ECG output must
be
 reviewed by a physician investigator.  Any clinically significant cardiac abnormalities
identified on the ECG should disqualify a subject.  Data from the ECG will be collected in
the eCR
F.

Blood and urine samples will be collected for testing at a central laboratory, as shown
below.
Chemistry:  alkaline phosphatase, ALT, anion gap, AST, bicarbonate, blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride, creatine kinase, creatinine, eGFR, GGT, HCG,  
inorganic phosphate, ma
gnesium, osmolality, potassium, sodium,  uric acid. CK -
MB will be tested in sam
ples where the CK value is greater than 2.5 times the 
upper normal limit. 
Hematology:  hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets count, red blood cell count, white 
blood cell count (and differentials) 
Urinalysis: including electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium), 
microscopic analysis, urine osmolality

4.4. Pregnancy 
 
Subjects who are female and of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test 
done at screening. A positive result will rule out the participation of the subject in the 
study. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at Visits 4 (Month 6) and 6 (Month 12). If 
a subje
ct becomes pregnant during the study, the subject must be removed from the study 
and followed until one month after the end of the pregnancy. 
 
Female stud
y subjects must be surgically sterilized or using oral contraceptives, depot 
contraceptives, double-barrier method, intrauterine device, or testifies that she is monogamous 
with a vasectomized partner. Subjects practicing abstinence must agree to use an acceptable form 
of birth control should they become sexually active during the study. 
 
Women with a history of bilateral tubal ligation are not considered of childbearing 
potential and are not required to have a urine pregnancy test at screening. 
 
Oral contraceptives, hormone implants, and injections are only considered effective if 
started at least 1 month before the study.  
 
Menopausa
l status is defined when menses have been absent for 12 months in a woman of 
appropriate age (usually 45 to 55 years) who has no other suspected or identified cause of 
amenorrhea. 
 
4.5. Concomitant Medications 
 
The use
 of concomitant medication will be recorded from 7 days prior to Visit 1 until the 
end of the study at the telephone contact on Day 374. Subjects enrolled in this study will 
not be permitted to t
ake any laxatives (other than the sponsor supplied rescue bisacodyl), 
whether pr
escription or over-the-counter, from Visit 1 until after completion of Visit 6. 
Any re
stricted laxative use during the study may result in terminati on of subject’s 
participation. Subjects may not initiate treatment with any constipating medication.

5.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting 
 
An Adve
rse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use  
of a drug in hum
ans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
finding), sympt
om, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product. 
 
Adverse event collection will coincide with the subject providing informed consent to 
participate in t
he study and will conclude with the end of study participation at Day 374 
Follow-up Call.  Diarrhea should be reported as an adverse event if a subject has more 
than 3 water
y stools per day. Subjects with clinically significant laboratory results at Visit 
6 which are classified by the Investigator as adverse events should return for a repeat 
blood draw. S
ubjects will be instructed to report promptly adverse events to the Investigator. 
The
 Investigator will record date/time of report, date/time of onset, description of the adverse 
event, severity of adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the event, action(s) 
taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and the Investigator's 
assessment of relationship of adverse event to study treatment. 
 
The Investigator should assess the severity of each adverse event using the following categories: 
 
Grade Severity Description  
1 
 Mild Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
Causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
Causing some limitations of usual activities  
3 
Severe Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual  
activities 
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death  
Life threatening or disabling  
5 Fatal Causes death of the participant

Version dated 4-13-2016   Page 22 of 35 The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event using 
the following categories: 
 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. 
DEFINITE  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. 
 
In published Phase 3 studies, adverse events associated with BLI400 administered at 
doses require
d for effective treatment of constipation included flatulence, nausea, 
vomiting, a
bdominal cramping or pain and bloating. These adverse reactions were 
transient and subside
d rapidly upon dose adjustment or cessation.

Version dated 4-13-2016   Page 23 of 35 6. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING 
 
A Se
rious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in at 
least one of the following outcomes: 
- Results in death 
- Is life-threatening 
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
- Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage 
 
SAE collection will coincide with the subject providing informed consent to participate in 
the study and 
will conclude 30 days after a subject’s last dose of study  medication. Shoul d 
a s
erious and/or unexpected adverse event occur, the Investigator must notify Braintree 
Laboratories immediately.  The Investigator will make a decision regarding continuing the 
subject’s study participation, and may request input from Braintree Laboratories. The 
Investigator will be responsible for recommending or providing the subject with appropriate 
medical therapy. All subjects experiencing serious adverse events will be followed until 
satisfactory resolution occurs. Braintree Laboratories must be kept apprised of all follow-ups 
relative to serious adverse events. In addition, Investigators must comply with the SAE 
reporting requirements of the Institutional Review Board with oversight of the study. 
 
Any serious and/or unexpected adverse events that occur during the study will be reported 
to Braintree Laboratories as follows: 
Contact Telephone Numbers: 
During Business hours     781-843-2301

8. MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS 
8.1. M
odification of Protocol 
Neit
her an Investigator nor Braintree Laboratories will modify the protocol without first 
obtaining the concurrence of the other and the IRB. Investigators that continually violate 
the protocol or commit a serious violation may be subject to termination from the study. 
The study may be halted if at any time an Investigator or Braintree Laboratories deems 
the incidence or severity of adverse events to be unacceptable. 
 
8.2. Subjects Discontinued from the Study 
Su
bjects may be dropped from the study for any of the following reasons: 
1) Subject took prohibited medications during the Treatment Period 
2) An adverse event requiring discontinuation (including failure to tolerate study 
medication). 
3) The Investigator decides that the subject should be dropped from the  
   
    study (e.g. serious adverse event, protocol violation, non-compliance). 
4) The subject decides to withdraw from the study. Subjects are free to  
       withdraw their consent and discontinue participation in the study at any  
       time. 
 
Braintree Laboratories should be contacted if possible prior to discontinuation of any subject .

9.1. Sample Size 
Consi
stent with ICH E1A Guideline for Industry, the Extent of Population Exposure to 
Assess Clinical Safety: for Drugs Intended for Long-term Treatment of Non-Life-
Threatening Conditions (March 1995) , 300 subjects will be treated with BLI400 for 12 
months. 
This will allow for detection of adverse events that may increase in frequency or 
severity over time. 
9.2. Parameters to be Analyzed 
Th
e primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety of BLI400 used chronically for 
12 months in subject s with constipation. Safety will be analyzed using ECG, vital signs, 
chemistry, hematology and urinalysis and adverse event data. Treatment emergent adverse 
event rates will be descriptively presented by preferred term, severity, and relationship to 
treatment.  
9.3. Planned Analyses  
9.3.1.Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Base
line demographic characteristics will be tabulated with N, mean, standard deviation, 
and range of values where appropriate 
Age
Gender
Race/ethnicity
Constipation History
9.3.2.Safety Analyses 
Analysis of safety will be performed using the modified Intent to Treat population (see 
Section 9.4 ).

Protocol Number BLI400- 303 
Version dated 4-13-2016   Page 26 of 35 Adverse Events 
Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA classification to provide a preferred 
term and primary system organ class for each event.  Proportions of subjects with adverse 
events will be presented for the overall study population, and each demographic subgroup 
(age, gender and race). Tables of AEs will be presented by system organ class and 
preferred term, and include overall totals for AEs within each system organ class.  
Counting will be done by subject and not by event.  A table of counts and percentages will 
also be made of those subjects with SAEs or AEs which led to withdrawal from the study.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as adverse events that had an onset day and time on 
or after the day and time of the first dose of study drug until the Day 374 Follow-up Call.  
Adverse Events having missing onset dates will be considered as treatment emergent. 
The difference in adverse event rates between study periods will be tested by Chi-Square 
or Fisher’s exact test with 95% confidence intervals. 
Laboratory Parameters  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each laboratory parameter at each visit. Laboratory data 
will be summarized for the overall population and the elderly and non-elderly subgroups. 
When calculating the summary statistics only, the last observation within a visit window 
will be used if there are multiple observations.  Changes from baseline (Visit 1) will be 
presented in a similar format.  An additional listing will be provided of those subjects who 
have clinically significant laboratory values.  The data will also be presented as shift 
tables and clinically significant abnormalities will be examined. 
Results of laboratory tests for the change from baseline (Visit 1) and group differences 
will be tested using ANOVA.

Summary statistics (i.e., mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each vital sign at each visit and compared to the values 
obtained at Visit 1.  When calculating the summary statistics only, the last observation 
within a 
visit window will be used if there are multiple observations.  The data will also 
be presented as shift tables and clinically significant abnormalities will be examined. 
ECG variables will be tabulated and presented for data collected at each visit. Data will be 
tabulated and summarized with descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, CV%, SEM, 
minimum, and maximum) for each of the ECG variables. The differences in ECG 
variables between Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 2 and Visit 6 will be tested using ANOVA.  
 
9.3.3. Efficacy Analyses (Patient Reported Outcomes) 
Subjec
t constipation symptoms and quality of life indicators will be analyzed using data 
from the subject-completed PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL instruments. Change from baseline 
to each visit t
ime point will be presented for each collected measure and will be tested 
using ANOVA. Data for each measure and time point will also be presented categorically 
by severity and tested using Chi-Square or Fisher’s exact test. 
 
9.4. Study Populations  
The following
 populations have been defined for data analyses. 
9.4.1.Intention- to-Treat (ITT) Population 
This population includes all enrolled subjects that were dispensed study medication. 
9.4.1. Modified Intention- to-T reat (mITT) Population

Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 5 of 35 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
The present approaches to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are 
limited and for some patients there are significant drawbacks that have not been resolved. 
It would be desirable to provide a source of relief for constipation that would permit 
dosing adjustments to optimize efficacy and safety and that would be pleasant to consume 
to improve patient compliance. The treatment should not have the safety issues associated 
with oral phosphate laxatives, have an acceptable safety profile, and be effective in 
numerous types of constipation.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc. is investigat ing the use of a new chemical composition, 
BLI400 (Lactitol Monohydrate NF Powder for Reconstitution) as a treatment for adult 
constipation.  Ample published literature with lactitol provides significant preclinical and 
clinical studies which sup port the safe and effective use of this GRAS -listed compound.  
These reports indicate that the BLI400 lactitol composition has promise as a candidate for 
further development for the treatment of constipation, as reviewed herein. 
BLI400 is a member of the p harmaceutical class of osmotic laxatives; specifically it is a 
non-absorbed, colonically metabolized sugar alcohol (polyol). Studies reviewed  here 
indicate it provides relief from the symptoms of constipation by rapidly inducing a 
patient-controlled bowel movement. While lactitol appears to be minimally, if at all, 
absorbed in the small intestine,  colonic microbes split lactitol into D -galactose and D -
sorbitol, which are fermentable to organic acids including lactic, formic, propionic, 
butyric and acetic a cids (as reviewed in Patil et al, 1987).  The osmotic properties of the 
small organic molecules consistently point to their pharmacodynamic effects as dependent 
on water retention with the stool.  Thus, BLI400 is a pro -drug of an essentially non -
absorbed o smotic laxative . Lactitol is generally considered to be pharmacologically inert  
and is often referred to as a “prebiotic” with no specific receptor targets for its laxative 
action.  
Rationale for Performing Research with the Investigational Product  
Lactitol monohydrate, at a daily dose of 21 grams per day appears to be a safe and 
effective treatment for constipation, but it has not been studied and proven in clinical 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -303 
Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 6 of 35 trials in the US. Lactitol appears to be a “prebiotic”, a substrate for colonic bact eria which 
convert it into osmotically active small molecules. Extensive published and non -published 
literature supports its safety and efficacy, but a Phase I II clinical trial is required for its 
registration in the US.  It is envisaged there will be one,  multi-site, controlled stud y in 
patients with documented constipation and that the design will be similar to other studies 
that have led to the approval of laxatives, such as those for MiraLAX, NDA 22 -015 and 
consistent with FDA’s recommendations for study endpoints in CIC trials .  
 
Physical, Chemical, and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation  
Lactitol is a simple monosaccharide sugar alcohol, a synthetic derivative of the milk sugar 
lactose that was discovered in the 1920s.  It is a dry, free flowing powder, readily soluble 
in aqueous solutions.  As shown by the structure diagrams, it is an analog of the 
disaccharide lactulose.

Protocol Number BLI400 -303 
Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 7 of 35 Nonclinical Studies :  Extensive non clinical studies have been performed with lactitol as 
support for its registration and marketing in countries outside the US  and are reviewed in 
detail in the BLI400 Investigators’ Brochure .  The studies have covered basic 
pharmacology, genotoxicity and mutagenicity, acute and chronic studies including 
carcinogenicity and re productive toxicity.  These studies were carried out in mice, rats, 
dogs and rabbits.  
 
Pharmacology:  Lactitol is not degraded by the galactosidase enzymes of the small 
intestine However, colonic microflora degrade lactitol extensively in rats so that lactitol 
elevated the proportions of acetic acid and lowered proportions of butyric acid in the 
hindgut of  rats. The osmotic effects of these organic acids appear to provide the 
pharmacodynamic basis for lactitol’s laxative action. Increased output of moist feces was 
seen in all animals species studied in a dose -related manner. The highest doses tested 
caused frank diarrhea in some studies.  
Metabolic Effects: In some studies, total serum cholesterol and triglycerides were 
reduced equally in rats fed diets containing 7% sorbitol or lactitol .  By acidifying fecal 
contents, lactitol lowered ammonia levels in animal models of hepatic encephalopathy, 
perhaps as a result of production of the poorly absorbed ammonium ion that follows 
lowering the cecal pH. Rats fed a diet containing 5% of lactitol for two weeks displayed a 
significant increase of calcium absorption.  
Toxicology  Studies: Only weak edema ensued after lactitol application to intact skin, but 
erythema and edema emerged when it was applied to abraded skin. Rodents treated with 
lactitol had l oose, frequent stools and cecal enlargement . This was often accompanied by 
decreased weight gain and increased water consumption. Clinical chemistry changes 
included changes in electrolyte levels, decreased cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase. 
Perhaps as compe nsation for the electrolyte changes that probably followed the diarrhea, 
adrenal weight and hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata were seen in the highest dose 
groups.  Renal tubular degeneration with nephrocalcinosis was occasionally seen and may 
follow the  increased calcium absorption. Lactitol was not considered positive for 
mutagenicity or chromosomal damage studied in standard in vitro and in vivo assays. 
Life-long carcinogenicity studies have indicated that Leydig cell dysplasia occurred in 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -303 
Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 8 of 35 rats at high  lactitol doses, but this was not seen in mice dosed for 24 month s or dogs 
dosed for 12 months. This species -specific effect in some rat strains was not considered 
significant to humans , since ordinary milk sugar, lactose, produces a similar effect in 
rodents.  
Clinical Pharmacology and Safety:  Since lactitol is extensively degraded to organic 
acids in the colon, it is little surprise that there are no published studies on its level in 
blood after administration.  Some have estimated that only 0.6% of an or al dose of lactitol 
is excreted in urine . Similar to what is found in animals, lactitol is extensively 
metabolized in the human colon, making available a significant proportion of the 
metabolites for colonic absorption.  Unlike in animals, l actitol does not  seem to stimulate 
calcium absorption in humans, although in one study when 15 g of lactitol was 
administered along with calcium in solution to fasting volunteers , calcium absorption was 
diminished .  Administering lactitol increases fecal Bifidobacteria  levels, while other 
bacteria ( fecal anaerobes, aerobes, Enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli ) were unaffected. 
After the ingestion of 25 g lactitol, xylitol, or glucose by eight healthy male volunteers the 
rise in plasma glucose was significantly greater 30 an d 60 minutes after ingestion of 
glucose while no rise in plasma glucose followed ingestion of lactitol.  
The investigation of the use of a mixture of lactitol for the treatment of constipation has been 
extensively studied, but the information is only avail able in published form. From these 
observations, it appears that lactitol’s adverse events are limited largely to the gastrointestinal 
system. Symptoms such as nausea, cramps, abdominal pain, flatulence and vomiting may be 
expected and could lead to withdr awal from the study if not controlled.  Their incidence and 
severity may be ameliorated in some patients by dose -adjustment .  Changes in hematology, 
clinical chemistry or urinalysis may be seen, and their clinical significance will be assessed 
during the d evelopment of lactitol.  In one study  plasma potassium was elevated with lactitol, 
but the values stayed within the normal range.  
Clinical Efficacy : Lactitol has been marketed since at least 1985 outside the US in 
Europe and other regions (where it is known as Lactitol Ex -Lax® or Importal®, for 
example) as a syrup or powder for the treatment of constipation in adults , including the 
elderly and children.  As a result a substantial body of evidence has accumulated on its 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -303 
Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 9 of 35 use in treating constipation, as e videnced by more than 19 publications since 1988, 
including two recent review articles (Maydeo, 2010; Faruqui and Joshi, 2012).  
A minimal effective dose of 0.25 g/kg has been suggested, and most studies have found 
that a starting dose of 20 g of lactitol i s effective and produces minimal side effects.  
Some studies that have allowed the subjects to make dosage increases to achieve relief of 
constipation symptoms and dose reductions to minimize side effects have indicated that 
this strategy can optimize ther apy.  
Maydeo (2010) presented a systematic review of six published randomized, non -
randomized and open trials comparing the safety and efficacy of lactitol to those of 
lactulose. Overall, lactitol was comparable to lactulose in efficacy measures (normal st ool 
consistency and number of bowel movement per week). Patients found lactitol to be more 
acceptable and were more compliant with it largely due to its superior palatability (73.2 % 
vs. 26.8 %). Lactitol was significantly better than lactulose in the freq uency of adverse 
events (31.2 ± 0.8 % vs. 62.1 ±1.1 %, p= 0.0019). The physicians’ assessment favored 
lactitol as compared to lactulose (61.91% vs. 47.83%).  The following table is adapted 
from Maydeo’s summary of the reviewed trials.

To evaluate the safety of chronic use of BLI400 laxative in constipated adults. 
 
3. STUDY PLAN  
3.1. Study Design  
This is an open -label, multi -center study in which constipated subjects will receive 
BLI400 for 12 months . 
3.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 300 constipated  subjects will be enrolled into this study, including 
approximately 1 00 elderly subjects (> 65 years of age at Visit 1).  
3.3. Duration of Study  
Qualifying subjects will receive BLI400 at Visit 1 and will begin a 12-month Treatment 
Period. Subjects will return for clinic visits at the end of Months 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12. A 
follow up call will take place 2 weeks after the end of treatment.  A completed subject is 
defined as a subject that completes the Visit 6 (Month 12) visit.  
 
3.4. Study Treatments  
 
BLI400 Laxative 
BLI400 laxative will be provided polyethylene bottles containing sufficient study 
medication  for 30 days of dosing.  The bottles will be equipped with a cap that can be 
used to measure 10.5 grams of BLI400.  Each bottle will also have a clinical label 
containing a caution statement, study  code, study sponsor and subject number. Subjects 
will be instructed to mix the contents of 2 capfuls (approximately 21 g) in 4 - 8 oz of juice 
or other beverage, and take once daily preferably in the morning . Subjects that develop 
persistent diarrhea or l oose stools will be allowed to adjus t their dose down to 10.5g (1 
capful) per day.

Rescue Bisacodyl  
Subjects will be dispensed bisacodyl at each study visit  (previously dispensed bisacodyl 
may be redispensed if needed, although this is not encouraged). Subjects will be instructed  
to take 5 – 10mg (1 – 2 tablets) of bisacodyl if they are experiencing severe discomfort 
due to their constipation, or have not had a BM in 4 days.  No more than 6 tablets (30mg) 
of bisacodyl should be taken in a week.  
 
If a subject does not have a bowel movement within 24 hours of taking a bisacodyl dose, a 
second dose should be taken. If after the second bisacodyl dose the subject does not have a 
BM within 24 hours, the subject should contact the site. The investigator should then 
consider having the subject return for an evaluation and/or discontinuing the subject from 
the study.  
 
All study medication is required to remain at room temperature 20°-25°C (68° -77°F); 
excursions permitted between 15° -30°C (59° -86°F).

in the form of a signed informed consen t form (refer to Section 4.1.1)  
• Assess eligibility (refer t o inclusion/exclusion criteria)  
• Review of medications  
• Medical history including history of constipation (ROME criteria  – See Inclusion #2 ) 
• Physical examination  
• Vital signs , including assessment of orthostatic hypotension  (while seated and after standing 
for a minimum of 2 minutes) including height and bodyweight , pulse and temperature  
• A 12-lead ECG will be performed by qualified, trained site per sonnel.  ECG output must 
be reviewed by a physician investigator.  Any clinically significant cardiac abnormalities 
identified on the ECG should disqualify a subject.  Data from the ECG will be collected in 
the eCRF.  
• Urine pregnancy test (if applicable)  
• Blood and urine s amples will be collected for  testing at a central laboratory, as shown 
below.

nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride, creatine kinase, creatinine, eGFR, GGT, HCG,  
inorganic phosphate,  magnesium, osmolality, potassium, sodium,  uric acid.  CK-
MB will be tested in samples where the CK value is greater than 2.5 times the 
upper normal limit.  
Hematology:  hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets count, red blood cell count, white 
blood cell count (and differentials)  
Urinalysis : including electrolytes  (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium) , 
microscopic analysis, urine osmo lality 
 
Subjects with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, deemed as a potential 
safety issue by the Investigator, may be discontinued at the Investigator’s 
discretion.   
If the subject is eligible for the study, assign a subject number .

are experiencing severe discomfort due to their constipation, or have not had a BM in 4 
days. 
• Instruct subject to maintain their normal dietary ha bits during study particip ation 
• Schedule the next study visit to occur after 60 days  
 
Subjects that are ineligible due to prohibited medication use (Exclusion Criteri on 10) may 
be washed out for a period of 14 days . No additional procedures should be performed on 
these subjects. After the washout period, subjects may be enrolled and all Visit 1 procedures 
should be repeated (with the exception of obtaining informed consent).   
4.1.1.   Informed Consent  
Following the informed consent process, study subjects will sign a current IR B approved 
consent form. No study procedures may be performed prior to the subject providing informed 
consent. The subject’s original signed and personally dated Informed Consent Form (together 
with any subsequent IRB approved amended versions) must be ret ained by the Investigator in 
the subject’s file.  A copy of the original signed and dated Informed Consent Form must be 
given to the subject.  
4.1.2.  Enrollment and Allocation of Subject Number

4.4. Pregnancy  
 
Subjects who are female and of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test 
done at screening. A positive result will rule out the participation of the subject in the 
study. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at Visits 4 (Month 6) and 6 (Month 12) . If 
a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject must be removed from the study 
and followed until one month after the end of  the pregnancy.  
 
Female study subjects must be surgically sterilized or using oral contraceptives, depot 
contraceptives, double -barrier method, intrauterine device, or testifies that she is monogamous 
with a vasectomized partner. Subjects practicing abstinence must agree to use an acceptable form 
of birth control should they become sexually active during the study.  
 
Women with a history of bilateral tubal ligation are not considered of childbearing 
potential and are not required to have a urine pregnancy test at screening.  
 
Oral contraceptives, hormone implants, and injections are only considered effective if 
started at least 1 month before the study.  
 
Menopausal status is defined when menses have been absent for 12 months in a woman of 
appropriate age (usually 45 to 55 years) who has no other suspected or identified cause of 
amenorrhea . 
 
4.5. Concomitant Medication s 
 
The use of concom itant medication will be recorded from 7 days prior to Visit 1 until the 
end of the study  at the telephone contact on Day 374 . Subjects enrolled in this study  will 
not be permitted to take  any laxatives  (other than the sponsor supplied rescue bisacodyl) , 
whether prescription or over -the-counter, from Visit 1 until after completion of Visit 6. 
Any restricted laxative use  during the study may result in termination of subject’s 
participation. Subjects may not initiate treatment with any constipating medication .

5.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use   
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant  abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
 
Adverse event collection will coincide with the subject providing informed c onsent to 
participate in the study and will conclude with the end of study participation at Day 374 
Follow-up Call.  Diarrhea should be reported as an adverse event if a subject has more 
than 3 watery stools per day. Subjects with clinically significant la boratory results at Visit 
6 which are classified by the Investigator as adverse events should return for a repeat 
blood draw. Subjects will be instructed to report promptly adverse events to the Investigator. 
The Investigator will record date/time of repor t, date/time of onset, description of the adverse 
event, severity of adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the event, action(s) 
taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and the Investigator's 
assessment of relationshi p of adverse event to study treatment.  
 
The Investigator should assess the severity of each adverse event  using the following categories:  
 
Grade Severity Description  
1 
 Mild Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
Causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
Causing some limitations of usual activities  
3 
Severe Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual  
activities 
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death  
Life threatening or disabling  
5 Fatal Causes death of the participant  
 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -303 
Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 22 of 35 The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event using 
the following categories:  
 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. 
DEFINITE  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. 
 
In published Phase 3 studies, adverse events associated with BLI400 administered at 
doses required for effective treatment of constipation included flatulence, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal cramping  or pain and bloating . These adverse reactions were 
transient and subsided rapidly  upon dose adjustment or cessation .

Institutional Review Board (IRB)  review and approval of the study protocol and Informed 
Consent Form will be obtained prior to initiation of the study.  Amendments to the study 
protocol and consent form generated during the course of the st udy will also require IRB 
approval. 
 
 
8. MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS  
8.1. Modification of Protocol  
Neither an Investigator nor Braintree Laboratories will modify the protocol without first 
obtaining the concurrence of the other and the IRB. Investigators tha t continually violate 
the protocol or commit a serious violation may be subject to termination from the study. 
The study may be halted if at any time an Investigator or Braintree Laboratories deems 
the incidence or severity of adverse events to be unaccept able. 
 
8.2. Subjects Discontinued from the Study  
Subjects may be dropped from the study for any of the following reasons:  
1) Subject took prohibited medications  during the Treatment Period 
2) An adverse event requiring discontinuation (including failure to tolerate study 
medication).  
3) The Investigator  decides that the subject should be dropped from the  
       study (e.g. serious adverse event, protocol violation , non-compliance ). 
4) The subject decides to withdraw from the study. Subjects are free to  
       withdraw their consent and discontinue participation in the study at any  
       time. 
 
Braintree Laboratories should be contacted if possible prior to discontinuation of any subject . 
If a subject is discontinued from the study, Braintree Laboratories must b e notified with an 
explanation for all discontinuances.

9.1. Sample Size  
Consistent with ICH E1A Guideline for Industry, the Extent of Population Exposure to 
Assess Clinical Safety: for Drugs Intended for Long -term Treatment of Non-Life-
Threatening Conditions (March 1995) , 300 subjects will be treated with BLI400 for 12 
months. This will allow for detection of  adverse events that may increase in frequency or 
severity over time . 
9.2. Parameters to be Analyzed  
The primary objective of t his study is to investigate the safety of BLI400 used chronically for 
12 months  in subjects with constipation. Safety will be analyzed using ECG, vital signs, 
chemistry, hematology and urinalysis  and adverse event data. Treatment emergent adverse 
event rates will be descriptively presented by preferred term, severity , and relationship to 
treatment.  
 
9.3. Planned Analyses  
9.3.1.Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline demographic  characteristics will be tabulated with N, mean, standard deviation, 
and range of values where appropriate  
• Age  
• Gender  
• Race/ethnicity  
• Constipation History  
 
9.3.2.Safety Analyses  
Analysis of safety will be performed using the modified Intent to Treat population (see 
Section 9.4).  
 
 
 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -303 
Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 26 of 35 Adverse Events  
Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA classification to provide a preferred term 
and primary system organ class for each event.  Proportions of subjects with adverse events 
will be presented for the overall study population, and each demographic su bgroup (age, 
gender and race).  Tables of AEs will be presented by system organ class and preferred term, 
and include overall totals for AEs within each system organ class.  Counting will be done 
by subject and not by event.  A table of counts and percentag es will also be made of those 
subjects with SAEs or AEs which led to withdrawal from the study.  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as adverse events that had an onset day and time on 
or after the day and time of the first dose of study drug until the Day 374 Follow -up Call.  
Adverse Events having missing onset dates will be considered as treatment emergent.  
The difference in adverse event rates between study periods will be tested by Chi -Square 
or Fisher’s exact test with 95% confidence intervals. 
Laboratory Parameters  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each laboratory parameter at each visit. Laboratory data will 
be summarized for the overall population and  the elderly and non -elderly subgroups.  When 
calculating the summary statistics only, the last observation within a visit window will be 
used if there are multiple observations.  Changes from baseline  (Visit 1) will be presented 
in a similar format.  An ad ditional listing will be provided of those subjects who have 
clinically significant laboratory values.  The data will also be presented as shift tables and 
clinically significant abnormalities will be examined.  
Results of laboratory tests for the change fr om baseline ( Visit 1) and group differences will 
be tested using ANOVA.

subjects) will be presented for each vital sign at each visit  and compared to the val ues 
obtained at Visit 1.  When calculating the summary statistics only, the last observation 
within a visit window will be used if there are multiple observations.  The data will also be 
presented as shift tables and clinically significant abnormalities wi ll be examined.  
ECG variables will be tabulated and presented for data collected at each visit . Data will be 
tabulated and summarized with descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, CV%, SEM, 
minimum, and maximum) for each of the ECG variables. The differences i n ECG 
variables between Visit 1 ( Baseline), Visit 2 and Visit 6  will be tested using ANOVA.  
 
9.3.3.  Efficacy Analyses ( Patient Reported Outcomes ) 
Subject constipation symptoms and quality of life indicators will be analyzed using data 
from the subject-completed PAC -SYM and PAC -QOL instruments. Change from baseline 
to each visit time point will be presented for each collected measure and will be tested 
using ANOVA. Data for each measure and time point will also be presented categorically 
by severity and tested using Chi -Square or Fisher’s exact test . 
 
9.4. Study Populations  
The following populations have been defined for data analyses.  
9.4.1.Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
This population includes all enrolled subjects that were dispensed study medicatio n. 
9.4.1.  Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT) Population

Protocol Title:   Open -Label, Single Arm, Phase 3b, Multi -Center Study Evaluating the Efficacy of 
Venetoclax (ABT -199) in Relapsed/Refractory Subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) 
(VENICE I)
Objectives:   
Prim ary Objective:   The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax 
monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  The primary 
efficacy endpoint will be measured by complete remission rate ( Com plete Rem ission Rate [CR] and 
Com plete Remission with Incomplete Marrow Recovery [CRi]; CR + CRi) as assessed by the 
investigator, of the subjects who have not been previously treated w ith B -cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) 
therapy.
Secondary Objectives:   The secondary objectives are to evaluate other efficacy parameters including the 
overall response rate (ORR), duration of overall response (DoR), time to progression (TTP), 
progression -free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the CR rate in BCRi treated subjec ts.  In 
addition, quality of life will be assessed using the following patient reported outcome (PRO) 
questionnaires:  the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L) questionnaire, a measure of general health 
status, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Leuk emia Questionnaire (FACT -Leu), a 
leukemia -specific health related quality of life for acute and chronic disease, and the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue Scale (FACIT -F).
The safety and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects w ith re lapsed/refractory CLL will also be evaluated.
Exploratory Objectives:   The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the level of Minimal Residual 
Disease (MRD) and the rate of MRD negativity in the peripheral blood.  
Investigators:   Multi- center
Study Sit es:  Approximately 7 sites in the United States and approximately 67 sites globally.
Study Population:   Subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL with or without the 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation, including subjects with an unknown status, as w ell as R/R CLL subjects who have been 
previously treated with B -cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) therapy.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 250 subjects

Methodology:   
This is a Phase 3b, single arm, open -label, multi -center study evaluating the efficacy of venetoclax in 
subjects with R/R CLL.  All screening procedures must be performed within 28 day s prior to initial study 
drug administration.  A contrast computed tomography (CT) scan (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] 
if a CT w ith contrast is medically contraindicated) w ill be accepted if previously performed w ithin 
35days prior to study drug adm inistration, otherwise a CT scan (or MRI) must be performed w ithin the 
screening period of 28 days.  The starting dose of venetoclax is 20 mg once daily.  The dose must be 
gradually increased over a 5 -week period up to the daily dose of 400 mg.  For all su bjects, study visits 
will be conducted within 72 hours of dosing and on the first and second day of Week 1 and Week 2 
during the dose titration phase.  Beginning on Week 3, through Week 5, study visits will be conducted 
within 72 hours of dosing and on Day 1 of each week.  Additional study visits on Day 2 of each week 
should be performed for subjects who continue to be at risk for TLS, based on investigator assessment.  
Study visits will be reduced to a monthly frequency at Week 8, and at Week 48, they will be reduced to 
every 3 months until the end of study treatment (Week 108).  In countries where venetoclax is not 
commercially available, subjects who continue to derive benefit after 2 years of treatment may be able to 
extend their treatment for up to 2 ad ditional years.  If a subject in the extended access phase of this study 
continues to derive benefit from Venetoclax after the 2 -year extension, then per PI 's assessment, subjects 
who are transferring to the venetoclax extension study, Study M19 -388, may r emain in Extended Access 
for up to additional 1 year or until the extension study is approved and initiated at the site, whichever is 
sooner .  A Disease Assessment for clinical response by physical exam and hematologic assessments will 
be performed at Scre ening, Week 24, Week 36 and Week 48.  To confirm the response, a CT scan will be 
performed at Week 48 on all subjects.  Biospecimens will be collected at designated time points 
throughout the study to conduct research to better characterize the disease.  M RD assessments will be 
performed by using peripheral blood specimens at Week 1 Day 1 (baseline), Week 24 and Week 48.  
When confirming a CR or CRi status per 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia National Cancer Institute Wo rking Group (IWCLL NCI WG) criteria w ith a 
bone marrow  (BM) biopsy and aspirate, MRD assessment of the BM aspirate should also be performed.  
After treatment discontinuation, a final visit will be performed.  Subjects w ill be followed for disease 
progressi on (if progression has not already occurred) and survival.  Post -treatment follow -up calls will be 
performed every 6 months until discontinuation from the study.  Survival information (i.e., the date and 
cause of death, post -treatment cancer therapies, dat e of progression etc.) will be collected.  This period 
will continue for 2 years following discontinuation of venetoclax.
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data intermittently according to the DMC 
charter.  Subsequent revie ws may be co nducted based on recommendations from the DMC or requests 
from the Sponsor.  Details of the DMC review will be presented in the DMC charter.

Duration of Treatm ent:  Subjects may continue receiving venetoclax for up to 2 years provided they 
continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease progression (based on investigator assessment), 
do not have unacceptable toxicity and do not meet any of th e criteria for subject discontinuation.  After 
treatment discontinuation, subjects w ill be followed for disease progression (if progression has not 
already occurred) and survival.  Post -treatment calls will be performed every 6 months until 
discontinuation from the study.  Survival information (i.e., the date and cause of death, post -treatment 
cancer therapies, date of progression etc.) will be collected.  This period w ill continue for 2 years 
following discontinuation of venetoclax.
In countries where vene toclax is not commercially available, subjects who continue to derive benefit after 
2 years of treatment may be able to extend their treatment for up to 2 additional years.  If a subject in the 
extended access phase of this study continues to derive benefi t after the 2 -year extension and venetoclax 
is still not commercially available in their country, they may continue their treatment for 1 additional 
year.  Per PI's assessment, subjects w ho are unable to transfer to the venetoclax extension study, Study 
M19-388, may remain in Extended Access for the additional 1 year or until the extension study is 
approved and initiated at the site, whichever is sooner.  AbbVie will work with the investigator on a case 
by case basis to consider the potential continuation o f venetoclax therapy.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Disease response will be assessed by the investigator, based on laboratory results and physical 
examinations using the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI -WG criteria for Tumor Response including CT 
imaging and bone marrow  biopsy and aspirate for subjects with CR to confirm the response (or MRI in 
the case CT is medically contraindicated).
All measurable disease must be documented at Screening by physical examination, laboratory testing, 
and CT scan (or MRI i n the case CT is medically contraindicated).  During the study, clinical disease 
assessments will take place at Week 24, Week 36, and Week 48.  To confirm the response, a CT scan w ill 
be performed at Week 48.
Minim al Residual Disease (MRD):
A peripheral b lood specimen will be collected from all subjects at Week 1 Day 1 (baseline), Week 24 and 
Week 48 to determine the level of minimal residual disease.  When confirming a CR/CRi status per 2008 
Modified IWCLL NCI -WG criteria w ith a bone marrow  biopsy and asp irate, MRD assessment of the BM 
aspirate should also be performed.  The level of MRD and MRD negativity will be assessed.  MRD 
negativity in the 2008 Modified IWCLLNCI -WG criteria is defined as the presence of less than one CLL 
cell per 10,000 leukocytes ( or below  10–4).
Pharm acokinetics:
A single pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sample w ill be collected from each subject and analyzed for plasma 
venetoclax concentration.
Safety:
Adverse event monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory assessments will be 
evaluated.
The study analyses will be descriptive.  All subjects participating in the study who received at least 
onedose of venetoclax will be included in the analyses unless otherwise noted in the separate, statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy:
The follow ing efficacy endpoints will be analyzed:  Complete Remission rate (CR + CRi), Overall 
Response Rate (ORR), Duration of Overall Response (DOR), Duration of Progression -Free Survival 
(PFS) and Over all Survival (OS):
Com plete Remission Rate (CR) and Complete Remission with Incomplete Marrow  Recovery (CRi)
Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a CR or CRi (all subjects and previously BCRi 
treated subjects).
Overall Response Rate (ORR)
Defined as the proportion of subjects w ith an overall response (complete remission plus partial 
remission).
Duration of Response (DOR)
Defined as the number of days from the date of first response (per the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI -WG 
criteria) to the date of d isease progression.  All disease progression will be included regardless whether 
the event occurred while the subject w as taking venetoclax or had previously discontinued venetoclax.
Time to Progression (TTP)
Defined as the number of days from the date of first dose of venetoclax to date of disease progression.  
All disease progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject w as 
taking venetoclax or had previously discontinued venetoclax.
Duration of Progression -Free Surviva l (PFS)
Defined as the number of days from the date of first dose of venetoclax to the date of disease progression 
or death, w hichever occurs first.  All disease progression will be included regardless whether the event 
occurred w hile the subject w as takin g venetoclax or had previously discontinued venetoclax.
Overall Survival (OS)
Defined as number of days from the date of first dose of venetoclax to the date of death.
Additional Exploratory Analyses Include:
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Level and Negativity Status: 
The level of MRD and the rate of MRD negativity will be assessed in the peripheral blood of all subjects 
at Week 1 Day 1 (baseline), Week 24 and Week 48.  MRD negativity will be defined as less t han 
oneCLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (or below  10–4).  Additionally, bone marrow  samples collected from 
subjects achieving CR/CRi will also be assessed for both the level of MRD and the rate of MRD 
negativity.  Rate of MRD status will be defined as the proportion of subjects who have MRD negativity 
status.  Ninety -five percent (95%) confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution will be 
provided.  The relationship between venetoclax PK and efficacy parameters including MRD level and CR 
will be evaluated.
Pharm acokinetics:
An analysis of venetoclax plasma concentrations will be performed using a population PK modeling 
approach.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Health Econom ic and Patient Reported Outcom e (PRO) Measures:
Quality of life will be assessed by using the following PROs:  the EQ -5D-5L, FACT -Leu, and the 
FACIT -F.
Quality of life endpoints will be summarized based on the scoring manuals for the instrument.  
Sample Size Estimation:
Using the CR rate of 6% reported for current therapies * 250 subjects w ould provide approximately 90% 
power (based on an exact test for single proportions using a tw o-sided alpha of 5%) to reject the null 
hypothesis of 6% in favor of an alternative hypothesis that the CR rate for venetoclax monotherapy is 
12% (doubling of the CR rate).
In order to provide approximately 80% pow er (based on an exact test for single proportions using a 
two-sided alpha of 5%) to reject the null hypothesis of 6% CR rate in favor of an alternative hypothesis 
that the CR rate for vene toclax monotherapy is 12% (doubling of the CR rate), the study will enroll 
190subjects who have not been previously treated with BCRi therapy.  Since there are approximately a 
total of 250 subjects, up to 60 subjects previously treated with BCRi therapy c an be enrolled. 
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects participating in the study who took at least one dose 
of study drug.  For the study as a whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory 
test results and vit al signs will be explored for trends and summarized.

3.0 Introduction
Bcl-2 Family Proteins
The B -cell l ymphoma -2 (Bcl- 2) famil y proteins are important regulators of the intrinsic 
apoptosis pathway .  The Bcl -2 oncogene was first identified in follicular lymphoma (FL) 
where the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation results in significant over -expression of the 
protein in B -cells.  The Bcl- 2 famil y of genes encodes a famil y of closely related proteins 
that possess either pro -apoptotic or anti -apoptotic activity  and share up to four Bcl -2 
Homology  (BH) domains.1-4  Bcl -2 overexpression is a major con tributor to the 
pathogenesis of some t ypes of ly mphoid malignancies.  Bcl -2 is also overexpressed in 
acute and chronic leukemias.  Chronic ly mphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a genetic disease 
where the microRNAs miR15a and miR16 -1 that negativel y regulate the t ranscription of 
Bcl-2 are deleted or down -regulated, resulting in uncontrolled expression of Bcl- 2.5,6
Venetoclax (ABT -199) 
Venetoclax, also known as ABT -199, is a novel, orally  bioavailable, small molecule Bcl -2 
family  protein inhibitor that binds with high affinity  (Ki < 0.010 nM) to antiapoptotic 
Bcl-2 and with lower affinity  to other antiapoptotic Bcl -2 famil y proteins like B -cell 
lymphoma -extra large (Bcl-X L) and B -cell ly mphoma -Walter and Eliza Hall I nstitute 
(Bcl-w) (> 4,000 -fold and > –2,000- to > 20,000- fold lower affinit y than to Bcl -2, 
respectivel y).8  Selective inhibition by  venetoclax disrupts Bcl -2 signaling and rapidl y 
induces multiple hallmarks of apoptotic cell death in Bcl -2
-dependent human tumor cell 
lines.8  Importantly , venetoclax inhibition of Bcl -2 is independent of p53 activity .
A detailed discussion of the non- clinical toxicology , metabolism, and pharmacology  can 
be found in 
the Investigator's Brochure.8
Venetoclax Clinical Data
In the Investigator's Brochure,8a total of 2495 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
venetoclax in compan y sponsored studies as of 28 November 2017.   2473 of these  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)

19
subjects are included in overall pooled analyses for reporting Reference Safety 
Information.  The 2473 subjects in the overall pooled anal ysis include 2224 oncology  
subjects (987 in monotherap y studies and 1237 in combination therap y studie s), 
153healthy  volunteers, 23 subjects with hepatic impairment and 73 subjects with SL E.  
Of the 2224 oncology  subjects, 1132 subjects had CLL/small ly mphocy tic ly mphoma 
(SLL), 569 subjects had Non -Hodgkin's Ly mphoma (NHL), 172 subjects had multiple 
myeloma (MM), 340 had Acute M yeloid Leukemia (AML), and 11 subjects had 
myelodysplastic s yndrome (MDS).  787 subjects with blinded data have been treated with 
either venetoclax combination therap y or a comparator treatment in company -sponsored 
venetoclax oncology  studies.  Doses administered in venetoclax clinical studies have 
ranged from 20 mg to 1200 mg.
The most common adverse events reported in venetoclax monotherapy studies were 
neutropenia (39.3%), nausea (31.4%) and diarrhea (24.9%).  The most common adve rse 
events that were grade 3 and above were neutropenia (34.9%), anemia (13.8%) and 
thrombocy topenia (12.8%).  The most common serious adverse events were febrile 
neutropenia (6.1%), pneumonia (5.4%), malignant neoplasm progression (3.4%), and 
pyrexia (3.3 %).  
Tumor ly sis sy ndrome (TLS) is an important risk, particularl y in subjects with R/R CLL.  
As a result of on -target effects, the potential for TLS with venetoclax was identified early  
in the program when the initial 3 subjects with CLL/SLL received sta rting doses of 
100mg or 200 mg and experienced TLS, which was reported as an adverse event for 
each.  Subsequently , 2 fatal events in the setting of TL S and another event of clinical TL S 
in subjects with CLL /SLL occurred in December 2012.  After comprehen sive review of 
all safet y data available from studies with venetoclax, a revised dosing regimen with a 
dose-titration phase of 5 weeks and enhanced TLS prophy laxis and monitoring measures 
were implemented in all CLL studies.  A subsequent anal ysis of data from subjects with 
CLL/SLL following the implementation of proph ylaxis measures, who completed 
monotherap y indicated a marked reduction in severity and frequency of TLS when 
compared to the previous anal ysis.  None of the subjects experienced an y serious

20
(including fatal) or nonserious event of clinical TLS (CTL S) or laboratory  TLS (LTLS) or 
had study  treatment discontinued because of TLS.  Since May  2014, a more personalized 
approach for proph ylaxis and monitoring measures, where subjects with lower tumor 
burden could receive venetoclax on an out -patient basis, has been evaluated with no cases 
of clinical TL S.  Overall, the clinical data strongl y support that the risk of TLS with 
venetoclax in CLL/SLL subjects is highest when initiating venetoclax dosing (5 -week 
dose titration phase), as well as being greater in subjects with a large tumor burden.
The safet y profile in combination studies is consistent with that observed in monotherap y 
studies and with known toxicity  profile of combination agents.  Prelimina ry efficacy  data 
indicate that venetoclax, both as monotherap y and in combination with other therapeutic 
agents, continues to show promising efficacy in oncology subject populations.  The 
overall response rate (ORR) in subjects with CLL/SLL was 75.0% to 81 .7% (dose 
escalation and safet y expansion cohorts, respectively), with a complete remission rate (CR 
+ CRi) of 32.1% in dose escalation and 11.7% in the safet y expansion cohort for 
venetoclax monotherap y (Study  M12 -175 as of 10 June 2016).9
Additional safet y and efficacy data are described in detail in the I nvestigator Brochure.8
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia is a ly mphoproliferative disorder, charact erized by  
progressive accumulation of monoclonal, small, mature -appearing CD5+ B cells in 
peripheral blood, bone marrow, and secondary l ymphoid organs.  It is the most common 
form of leukemia in adults in the Western World, accounting for approximately 30% of all 
leukemias.10  Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia primarily  affects elderl y individuals; 
however , approximately  one third of subjects are less than 60 y ears of age at diagnosis.11  
It is current ly estimated that annuall y approximately 15,000 people will be diagnosed with 
CLL in the United States and that almost 4,500 individuals will die of the disease.12  In 
Europe, CLL accounts for approximately  30% of all leukemias in adults with a reported 
age standardized incidence rate of 3.79 per 100,000 individuals (for CLL/SLL) in the 
years 2000 –2002.10,13  The approximate 5- year survival rate for subjects with CLL is  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)
M15 -550 Protocol Amendment 0.02.01.01.01 (ROW)
EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
21
73%.14  CLL presents with a variable clinical course.  Approximately one -third of subjects 
have indolent disease with prolonged median survival that does not require treatment, and 
die of causes unrelated to disease.  Another third have an initial indolent phase that is 
followed b y rapid progression of the disease requiring therap y.  The remaining third have 
aggressive disease and require treatment at the time of diagnosis.  Chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia subjects will often have compromised bone marrow reserve due to their 
underly ing disease.  The principal complication of CLL is immunodeficiency  related to 
myelosuppression and as a result, infection is the major cause of death in subjects with 
CLL.15
Standard chemotherapeutic options for CLL cause significant immune suppression and 
myelosuppression, are not well -tolerated b y the elder ly population and have not 
consistently  offered survival advantage.  Treatment decisions for subjects with CLL are 
made on the basis of considerations such as age, clinical stage, expected survival, and 
anticipated toxicities.  With the notable exception o f allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 
CLL is currentl y an incurable disease, despite good initial responses to chemo 
immunotherapy .  Nonetheless, globally  access to allogeneic stem cell transplant and/or 
clinical trials is limited, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to have increased 
toxicity  and reduced antitumor activity .
Chromosome 17p Deletions and TP53 Gene Mutations in Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia
Chromosome 17p deletions and TP53 gene mutations are among a group of genetic 
defects that occur in subsets of subjects with CLL in addition to defects causing Bcl- 2 
dysregulation.  The short arm of chromosome 17 contains the TP53 gene that encodes 
tumor protein p53, a tumor suppressor involved in deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) repair 
activation, cell cy cling regulation, and apoptosis signaling.  Standard cy totoxic 
chemotherapies used in the treatment of CLL (i.e., fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and 
bendamustine), act by  inducing DNA damage and triggering apoptosis.  The p53 tumor 
suppressor is ess ential for relay ing the DNA damage signal to the apoptotic machinery .  
When p53 is functionally inactivated, either through mutation or deletion, these signals

22
are not effectively  relay ed and the efficacy  of these agents is diminished.  Chromosome 
17p dele tions and TP53 mutations occur over the course of the disease and expand under 
treatment selection pressure as a result of the resistance to chemotherap y and 
chemoimmunotherap y they confer.16-18  Notably , over 80% of subjects with 17p deletions 
also carry  a TP53 mutation.17,19
The decreased likelihood of subj ects with 17p deletions and/or TP53 mutations 
responding to standard chemotherap y and chemoimmunotherapy regimens is 
accompanied by a greater risk of disease progression and a shorter overall survival 
(OS).7,16-18,20  In a long -term follow up study  of the effects of 17p deletions/TP53 
mutations in CLL subjects treated according to standard practice outside of a clinical 
study , survival periods measured from date of study sampling were 7.6 months or less for 
subjects with 17p deletions and/or TP53 mutations compared to 69 months for subjects 
without TP53 loss or mutations.21
Poorer outcomes in subjects with these aberrations have also been demonstrated in large 
randomized clinical treatment trials.  In the CLL8 trial (n = 817) comparing first -line 
chemoi mmunotherap y (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab) to chemotherap y alone 
(fludarabine/cy clophosphamide), multivariate analyses of prognostic indicators for 
survival at a median follow -up of 70 months found hazard ratios [HR] of 2.916 
(confidence interva l [CI]:  1.779 –4.781) and 2.715 (CI :  1.602 –4.602) for 
progression -free survival (PFS) and OS, respectively , for subjects with 17p deletions and 
2.123 (CI :  1.400 –3.218) and 3.014 (CI:  1.889 – 4.808), respectively , for subjects with 
TP53 mutations i ndicated.19  Poorer response to first -line treatment and shorter survival in 
subjects with 17p deletio
ns and/or TP53 mutations were also observed in the CLL4 trial 
of 777 subjects randomized to chlorambucil or fludarabine with or without 
cyclophosphamide and in subjects with 17p deletions treated in the E2997 trial (n = 278) 
of fludarabine with or without cyclophosphamide.22,23
Relatively  improved treatment responses have been shown in 17p deletion/TP53 mutant 
first-line and relapsed patient populations with alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody  
specific for B -cell surface molecule CD52, in combination with steroids

23
(e.g., methy lprednisolone, dexamethasone).24,25  In a Phase 2 study  (n = 39) the overall 
response rate, complete response (includi ng with incomplete bone marrow recovery ) rate 
(CR/CRi), median PFS, and median OS were 85%, 36%, 11.8 months, and 23.5 months, 
respectivel y, in the entire cohort and 88%, 65%, 18.3 months, and 38.9 months, 
respectivel y, in the 17 previously untreated subje cts.  Treatment -related death occurred in 
5% of subjects, 67% of subjects experienced Grade 3/4 hematologic and 
glucocorticoid- associated toxicity , and 51% experienced Grade 3 infection.24
The ty rosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib that act downstream of the B -cell 
receptor have also been shown to produce relatively  improved responses compare d to 
standard therapies and have been approved for use in some jurisdictions for the treatment 
of CLL subjects with 17p deletion (ibrutinib, idelalisib) or TP53 mutations (idelalisib 
only).  Ibrutinib inhibits Bruton's t yrosine kinase, an enzyme involved i n B-cell receptor 
signaling, homing, and adhesion.  A Phase 3 relapsed or refractory  CLL study  comparing 
ofatumumab (an anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody ) to ibrutinib included 127 subjects with 
the 17p deletion.  In this cohort, the median duration of PFS was 5.8 months in the 
ofatumumab arm but was not reached in the ibrutinib arm (HR 0.25; 95% CI :  0.14, 0.45).  
The overall response rate was 47.6% with ibrutinib compared with 4.7% with 
ofatumumab.  No complete responses were observed.25  Overall, 57% of subjects in the 
ibrutinib arm had at least one ≥ Grade 3 adverse event (AE).  The most frequent 
non-
hematologic AEs (> 20% of subjects) with ibrutinib were diarrhea, fatigue, p yrexia, 
and nausea.26  Gra de 3/4 AEs reported in 
≥ 5% of the 357 subjects with mantle cell 
lymphoma or CLL that received ibrutinib during clinical development were anemia, 
neutropenia, pneumonia and thrombocy topenia.27
Idelalisib targets the delta isoform of phosphatid ylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3Kδ) involved in 
signal transduction via multiple receptors including the B -cell receptor a nd chemokine 
receptors CXCR4 and CXCR5.  A Phase 3 study  comparing combined 
idelalisib/rituximab treatment with rituximab/placebo in previously treated subjects 
reported improved PFS in the idelalisib arm among the 96 subjects enrolled with 
17pdeletion or TP53 mutation (HR 0.12; CI :  0.05, 0.32).  The majorit y of AEs in the

24
study  were Grade 2 and the most common in the idelalisib arm were py rexia, fatigue, 
nausea, chills, and diarrhea.28  The overall safety profile determined in Phase 1 to 3 
studies of idelalisib in hematologic malignancies as monotherap y or in combination with 
an anti -CD20 monoclonal ant ibody  is characterized by  a very  common frequency  
(≥1/10 subjects) of ≥ Grade 3 infections, neutropenia, diarrhea/colitis and increased 
transaminase.29
CLL Subjects Who Have Received Prior B -Cell Receptor Inhibitor (BCRi) Therapy
Ibrutinib and idelalisib cause rapid response with reduction in lymph node size and 
splenic mass accompanied by  increased peri pheral blood (PB) l ymphocy tosis likely  
reflecting that microenvironment modulation could prevent these cells from receiving the 
survival signals delivered by  the microenvironment.30  In early trials of Ibrutinib, 
approximately  10% of the subjects developed progressive disease (PD).  Few of these 
subjects developed resistance after achieving partial response lasting ≥ 6 months.  Distinct 
single nucleotide variations were noted in these subjects.31
In addition, toxicities such as diarrhea, fatigue and py rexia are common and can affect the 
subjects who receive these drugs.26
,28
However, the mechanism of action of venetoclax is independent of the B -cell receptor 
(BCR) pathway .32  Briefly, venetoclax inhibits Bcl -2 allowing the release of BIM, which 
includes oligomerization of pro- apoptotic molecules such as BAK and BAX which 
triggers rapid apoptosis.  The clinical data to date with venetoclax monotherap y shows 
strong activity  in refractory  CLL indicating that it might be beneficial in a population that 
is refractory  to these newer therapeutic agents.
Despite some improvement in disease outcomes in relapsed/refractory CLL subjects, 
including those who have received novel agents, significant toxicities remain a concern, 
complete disease responses are uncom mon, and relapse is virtually
 inevitable.  Subjects 
carrying TP53 aberrations and those who have received prior BCRi therap y continue to 
represent a significant unmet medical need and current treatment recommendations

include participation in investigative clinical trials proceeding to allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation in responding subjects eligible for transplant (e.g., younger age 
with no co- morbidities and a suitable donor).16,33
Further details of disease activity  observed in clinical studies with venetoclax are 
provided in the Venetoclax I nvestigator's Brochure.8
3.1 Differences Statement
This is the first Phase 3b study  to assess the efficacy  of venetoclax monotherap y in 
relapsed or refractory  CLL.  The R/R CLL patient population will be enriched to include 
subjects who have previously  received BCRi therapy .  This will allow for the assessment 
of deep responses in this high risk/unmet need patient population.  I n this study , subjects 
will be assessed for efficacy  with standard criteria.  
3.2 Benefits and Risks
There is data that shows subst antial efficacy  of venetoclax monotherapy  in the treatment 
of relapsed/refractory  CLL characterized b y 17p deletions.  Venetoclax is expected to be 
as active in subject selected for TP53 mutations as these subject populations overlap and 
the oncogenic effe ct of both genetic defects occurs via p53 abrogation.  In addition, there 
is limited data in the BCRi failure CLL population for subjects that subsequently receive 
venetoclax and also in subjects without the 17p deletion.  Current CLL therapies do not 
reliably produce complete responses and are not curative in subjects with p53 aberrations 
or those refractory  to BCRi.  Furthermore, drugs more recentl y approved for these 
subjects are limited b y toxicity .
Clinical safety  data indicate that the adverse effects of venetoclax administered with 
appropriate measures are manageable and as expected from a treatment targeting 
hematologic cells including in subjects with 17p, TP53 mutation or subjects who have 
previously  received BCRi therapy .

4.0 Study  Objective
The primary  objecti ve of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  of venetoclax monotherapy  
in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic l ymphocy tic leukemia (CLL).  The primary  
efficacy  endpoint will be measured b y complete remission rate (CR + CRi) of the subjects 
who hav e not been previously  treated with BCRi therap y, as assessed b y the investigator.
The secondary  objectives are to evaluate other efficacy parameters including the overall 
response rate (ORR), duration of overall response (DoR), time to progression (TTP), 
progression -free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the CR rate in previously  
BCRi treated subjects. 
Additional secondary  objectives will also be evaluated, as well.  Quality  of life will be 
assessed using the following patient reported outcomes (P RO) questionnaires:  the 
EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L), a measure of general health status, the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therap y –Leukemia Questionnaire (FACT
-Leu), a leukemia -
specific health related quality  of life for acute and chronic disease, and the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therap y-Fatigue Scale (FACIT- F). 
The safet y and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL will 
also be evaluated.
Additional exploratory  objectives will be evaluated.  Minimal Res idual Disease (MRD) 
will be assessed in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) b y flow cytometry  and 
PCR.

This study  is designed to enroll approximately  250 subjects to meet scientific objectives 
without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  
All efforts will be made to adhere to these specific enrollment numbers; however, it would 
not be ethical to den y treatment to eligible subjects already in screening as they may have 
undergone stud y related procedures.
Subjects in this study  will be enrolled at approximate ly 67 research sites globally .
Subjects will undergo screening procedures within 28 days prior to initial venetoclax 
administration.  For all subjects, a contrast computed tomograph y (CT) scan (or medicall y 
indicated alternative such as magnetic resonance imaging [MRI ]) will be accepted if 
previously  performed within 35 day s prior to venetoclax administration.  Otherwise, a CT 
scan (or MRI) must be performed within the screening period of 28 days.  Following the 
4-week Screening period, eligible subjects wi ll initiate venetoclax and attend study  visits 
within 72 hours of dosing and on the first and second day of Week 1 and Week 2 during 
the dose titration phase.  Beginning on Week 3, through Week 5, study  visits will be 
conducted within 72 hours of dosing an d on Day  1 of each week.  Additional study  visits 
on Day  2 of each week should be performed for subjects who continue to be at risk for 
TLS, based on investigator assessment.  Study  visits will be reduced to a monthly  
frequency  at Week 8, and at Week 48, t hey will be reduced to every  3 months until the 
end of study  treatment (Week 108).  As of Week 8, the visit window for scheduled visits 
is ± 2 day s.  A 30 day  Safety  Follow -up Visit should be performed approximately  30 day s 
(± 3 day s) following the last do se of venetoclax (to allow for AE collection 30 days 
following last dose of study
 drug).  If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an 
ongoing AE or an unresolved clinically significant laboratory result, the site will attempt 
to provide follow -up until the AE has resolved to a ≤ Grade 1 or baseline or it is the 
investigator's judgment that the event is unlikely to resolve.
Venetoclax will be administered orall y once dail y (QD), continuousl y.  Venetoclax tablets 
should be taken with a meal and water in the morning at approximately  the same time 
each day .  To mitigate the risk for TLS, the first 5 weeks of treatment include a dose -
titration phase where venetoclax will be dosed in increments as outlined in Figure 1.  The

Disease response will be assessed b y the investigator based on laboratory results and 
physical examinations using the 2008 Modified International Workshop on CLL National 
Cancer Institute – Working Group (IWCLL NCI -WG) Guidelines for Tumor Response 
with th e addition of CT imaging (or MRI).  A Disease Assessment for clinical response b y 
physical exam and hematologic assessments will be performed at Screening, Week 24, 
Week 36 and Week 48.  To confirm the response, a CT scan (or MRI  if CT is medically  
contrai ndicated) will be performed at Week 48 on all subjects and BM samples will be 
collected for subjects with CR to confirm the response.  
MRD assessments will be performed b y using peripheral blood specimens at Week 1 
Day 1 (baseline), Week 24 and Week 48.  When confirming a CR status or complete 
remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery  (CRi) status per I WCLL NCI -WG 
guidelines with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, MRD assessment of the bone marrow 
aspirate should also be performed.
Quality  of life wil l be assessed b y using the following patient reported outcome 
questionnaires:  the EQ -5D-5L, the FACT -Leu, and the FACIT -F.  Quality  of life 
endpoints will be summarized based on the scoring manual for the instruments.

Subjects may  continue to receive ve netoclax for up to 2 y ears provided they  continue to 
tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease progression (based on investigator's 
assessment), do not have unacceptable toxicity  and do not meet any  of the criteria for 
discontinuation (see Section 5.4.1).  A final visit will be conducted upon treatment 
discontinuation.
After treatment discontinuation, subjects will be followed for disease progres sion (if 
progression has not already  occurred) and survival.  Post -treatment calls will be 
performed every  6 months until discontinuation from the study .  Survival information 
(i.e., the date and cause of death, post -treatment cancer therapies, date of pro gression, 
etc.) will be collected.  This period will continue for two years following discontinuation 
of venetoclax. 
All study  procedures will be performed as outlined in Section 5.3.1.1 and Appendix Dand 
Appendix E. 
For subjects who continue to derive benefit after 2 years of treatment, AbbVie will work 
with the investigator on a case b y case basis to consider the potential continuation of 
venetoclax therap y.  In countries where venetoclax is commer cially  available, extension 
of therap y ma y not be allowed.
A safet y anal ysis will be performed for all subjects participating in the study who took at 
least one dose of stud y drug.  For the stud y as a whole, serious adverse events and adverse 
events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory  test results and vital signs will be 
explored for trends and summarized. 
5.2 Selection of Study  Population
Subjects will undergo screening procedures within 28 days prior to initial venetoclax 
administration, with the exception of the CT scan (or MRI).  A CT scan will be accepted 
if previously  performed within 35 day s prior to venetoclax administration.

5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
All study  procedures outlined in Appendix Dand Appendix Eare discussed in detail in 
this section, with the exception of adverse event (A E) information (discussed in 
Section 6.1.1).  All study data will be recorded on electronic case report forms (eCRFs).
Informed Consent
Subjects must voluntarily  sign and date an informed consent form approved by  an 
IEC/IRB, prior to the initiation of any screening, study -specific procedures, or before an y 
prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in the study.  
Details about how in formed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
Section 9.3.
Screening
Procedures performed at Screening will serve as baseline, unle ss repeated on Week 1 
Day 1 prior to dosing; in which case the latter will serve as baseline.  An y abnormal 
laboratory  or vital sign assessment between screening and prior to administration of study  
drug will be recorded in the subject's medical history  and will also serve as the subject's 
baseline.  The schedule of study  visit procedures is based on subject stud y drug 
administration.  Scheduled study  visits and/or procedures will need to be altered if there is 
an interruption in study  drug administration. If study drug administration is interrupted 
for more than 3 day s (i.e., adverse event), the site will contact the AbbVie study team or 
AbbVie TA MD to adjust the subject's visit schedule, procedures and/or dosing on a case 
by case basis.
Subjects who sign ed informed consent, have had at least one study  procedure conducted, 
and are determined to be a screen failure, will not proceed in stud y.
Re-Screening Procedures
Subjects that initially  screen fail for the study  may  be permitted to re -screen following re -
consent.  All Screening procedures will need to be repeated.  The subject must meet all  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)

inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of re -screening in order to qualify  
for the stud y.  There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the 
study .  If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation including the CT scan 
and the re -screen visit is more than 35 day s since the initial screening assessment, a CT 
scan should be repeated.  As appropriate, sites are encouraged to contact the AbbVie TA 
MD to confirm if subjects should or should not be re -screened.
Detection of 17p Deletion or TP53 Mutation
Subjects may  have 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation as assessed b y local laboratory (in 
bone marrow or peripheral blood) to be considered as having this deletion/mutation.  
However, the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation is not a protocol required test for subjects to 
be enrolled in this study .  If a subject does have the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation, a 
recent test is desirable but any  previous positive test is acceptable.
Medical and Oncology History
A complete medical history , including history  of tobacco, nicotine -containing products 
and alcohol use, will be taken from each subject during the Screening visit, including: 
● docum entation of an y clinically significant medical condition
●a detailed oncology  history  including:
○histology
○cytogenetics
○date of CLL diagnosis
○stage
○any surgical procedures
○treatments administered (including dates, t ype of modality , response to 
treatment and reason for treatment discontinuation)  
On Week 1 Day  1, an y additional medical history observed after signing of the informed 
consent but prior to initial venetoclax ad ministration and not considered related to 
study -required procedures will be recorded in the subject's medical history .

Pregnancy Testing
●WOCP must have a negative serum pregnancy  test result at Screening, and a 
negative urine pregnancy test at Study  Day  1.  
●Screening – quantitative beta -human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-hCG) serum 
pregnancy  test.
●Week 1 Day  1:  Urine test, if it has been > 7 day s since obtaining the 
Screening serum pregnancy test results.
●During the study  a urine pregnancy  test can be perf ormed at the discretion of 
the investigator or per local guidelines.
●Females of non -childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently  
surgically sterile as defined in Inclusion Criteri on9) at Screening do not 
require pregnancy  testing.
Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Assessment
On Week 1 Day  1, an y protocol- related events observed from the time of signing of the 
informed consent but prior to initial venetoclax administration will be recorded as a 
serious or nonserious adverse event, if considered by  the investigator to be causall y 
related to the stud y-required procedures (See Figure 3). 
At each visit, including the Final Visit and t he Post- Treatment Follow -Up, the subject's 
medical history  will be reviewed and any  changes from baseline will be recorded on the 
adverse event eCRF.
If a subject reports taking any over -the-counter or prescription medications, vitamins 
and/or herbal suppl ements or if administration of any  medication becomes necessary  
beginning with Screening through the end of the study , the name of the medication, 
dosage information including dose, route and frequency, date(s) of administration 
including start and end dat es, and reason for use must be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF.

Vital Signs
Vital signs include bod y temperature (oral or ty mpanic), weight, blood pressure and pulse.  
On day s when venetoclax is administered in the clinic, blood pressure and pulse rate will 
be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 5 minutes.
NOTE:   Starting with visit Week 8/Day  1, vital signs may  be performed within 72 hours 
before or after the scheduled visit.
Physical Examination
At Screening, the subject should hav e a complete physical examination , including height 
and weight (height onl y performed during Screening).  A complete ph ysical examination 
should include the evaluation of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT); 
cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoske letal, respiratory , gastrointestinal and 
neurological s ystems. 
A symptom directed physical examination may be performed at all other visits (other 
than screening) and should be limited to sy stems of primary  relevance:  cardiovascular, 
respiratory , and tho se associated with sy mptoms.

Physical examinations performed as a part of Disease Assessments (Screening, Weeks 24, 
36, 48) are to include the evaluation of the presence and degree of enlarged lymph nodes 
in two di mension (cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal and femoral nodes), 
hepatomegal y, and splenomegaly.  These l ymph node evaluations should be noted on all 
physical examinations irrespective of being present or absent.  Refer to Disease 
Assessments (20 08 Modified I WCLL NCI -WG Criteria) for additional information 
pertaining to methods of measurement.
Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded at each subsequent phy sical 
examination.  New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs if appropriate.

If signs or symptoms suggestive of Richter's S yndrome are observed during ph ysical 
examination, further assessments (i.e., nodes, Positron Emission Tomography [PET] scan) 
should be considered to exclude or confirm the transformation. 
Please refer to Appendix Dand Appendix Efor timing of all ph ysical examinations.  
NOTE:   Starting with Week 8 Day  1, all Phy sical examinations may  be performed within 
72 hours before or after the scheduled visit.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Risk Assessment
At Screening, all stud y subjects will be assessed fo r risk of developing TLS.  The risk of 
TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including tumor burden and comorbidities.  
Subjects with high tumor burden (e.g., an y lymph node with a diameter ≥ 5 cm or high 
absolute ly mphocy te count [AL C] [AL C ≥ 25 × 109/L]) are at greater risk of TL S.  
Reduced renal function (estimated creatinine clearance [eCrCl] < 80 mL /min) further 
increases the risk.  The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases with venetoclax 
treatment.
Tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scans) as well as 
chemistry /hematology  assessments (refer to Table 4, Clinical L aboratory  Tests) will be 
performed in all subjects prior to initiating venetoclax treatment.
Appropriate venetoclax dosing and management of subjects throughout their study 
treatment is guided b y their individual risk for developing TLS.  Risk -based TL S 
prophy laxis and management measures are described in Section 6.1.8.1.
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status
For all subjects, the ECOG performance status47will be performed as outlined in 
Appendix Dand Appendix E.

It is recommended, where possible, that a subject's performance status will be assessed b y 
the same pers on throughout the study .  ECOG performance status will be assessed as 
follows:
Table 3. ECOG Performance Status
Grade Description
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre -disease performance without restriction.
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out 
work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office w ork.
2 Ambulatory and capable of all self -care but unable to carry out any work 
activities.  Up and about more than 50% of waking hours.
3 Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of 
waking hours.
4 Com pletely disabled.  Cannot carry on any self -care.  Totally confined to bed or 
chair.
NOTE:   Starting at Week 24 Day  1, ECOG performance status may  be performed within 
72 hours before or after the scheduled visit.
Coagulation Panel
Prothrombin time (PT) and/or I nternational Normalized Ratio (I NR) and activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) will be collected and will be anal yzed by the local laboratory  
during Screening onl y.

blood/plasma/serum samples left at room temperature, potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid 
assay readings.   The following special sample handling procedure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid 
degradation.  Uric acid must be analyzed in plasma.  Blood must be collected into pre -chilled tubes containing 
heparin anticoagulant.  Immediately immerse plasma samples for uric acid measurement in an ice water bath.   
Plasma samples must be prepared by centrifugation in a pre -cooled centrifuge (4°C).  Finally, the plasma must be 
maintained in an ice water bath and analyzed for uric acid within 4 hours of collectio n.
PRE -DOSE LABS:
Prior to the Initial Dose of Venetoclax, for all Subjects :
●During the Screening Period:   For all subjects, the chemistry/hematology panel 
(see Table 4, Clinical Laboratory  Tests) is required.
○Pre-existing abnormalities should be corrected 
●Within 72 hours of Week 1 Day  1:  If the screening labs were done more than 
72h before the planned fir st dose, the chemistry /hematology  panel should be 
repeated.  These results should be reviewed prior to dosing.
○Labs should be assessed and pre -existing abnormalities should be 
corrected.

EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
46
●On the day  of Week 1 Day  1:  Before dosing, the chemistry /hematology  panel 
should be drawn.
The results of the labs drawn on Week 1 Day 1 need to be reviewed prior to 
dosing IF an additional lab draw within 72 hours of the initial dose at Week 1 
Day 1 was not drawn AND reviewed.  
Prior to Each Subsequent Dose Increase, for all Subjects:
●Within 72 hours of each subsequent dose increase:   The chemistry /hematology  
panel should be repeated.  The results should be reviewed prior to dose 
increasing.
●Prior to dosing, on the day of each subsequent dose increase:   Before dosing, 
the chemistry /hematology  panel should be drawn.  The results of the labs 
drawn on Day  1 of each dose increase need to be reviewed prior to dosing IF
an additional lab draw within 72 hours of the dose increase was not drawn 
AND reviewed.  
POST -DOSE LABS:
For all subjects, the chemistry /hematology  panel (refer to Table 4, Clinical L aboratory  
Tests) should be monitored at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours after the first dose of 
venetoclax (20 mg) and after the first dose increase (50 mg).  Electroly te abnormalities 
should be corrected promptly .  The next venetoclax doses (the Day  2 20 mg venetoclax 
dose and the Day  2 50 mg venetoclax dose) sho uld not be administered until the 24 hour 
lab results have been evaluated.  Electrol yte abnormalities should be corrected promptly .  
For subjects who continue to be at risk of TLS, the same lab monitoring schedule (i.e., 6 
to 8 hour and 24 -hr post dose) sh ould be followed at the subsequent dose increases. 
This monitoring is also recommended during the re -initiation of the therapy after a dose 
interruption.
Additional monitoring may  be required based on the risk assessment b y the investigator 
and as directe d by the AbbVie TA MD.

Local laboratories will be utilized to process and provide results for clinical laboratory 
tests allowing for immediate subject medical management.  The principal investigator or 
sub-investigator will review, initial, and date all l aboratory  results used for subject 
treatment management after receipt from the local laboratory.  Local laboratory values 
will be entered b y the site directl y onto the appropriate eCRF and laboratory normal 
ranges for the laboratory  that is used will be pr ovided to the AbbVie Clinical Team.
A laboratory  test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the study, requires a 
subject to receive treatment, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding 
toxicity  management), or if the Investigator considers clinicall y significant will be 
recorded as an adverse event.
NOTE:   Starting with Week 8/Day  1, clinical laboratory  tests may  be collected within 
72hours prior to the scheduled visit.  
Disease Assessments (2008 Modified IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria)
All measurable disease must be documented at Screening (baseline), prior to the first dose 
of venetoclax, for all subjects based on the a nalysis of clinical laboratory  tests 
(hematology ), disease assessment phy sical examination, contrast -enhanced CT scan of 
involved neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis (or MRI, if CT scan with contrast is medically 
contraindicated).  Bone marrow examinations at screening are not required but results will 
be recorded if available. 
For all subjects, clinical response will be assessed by the investigator at Week 24, 
Week 36 and Week 48.  Disease response will be based on the analy sis of clinical 
laboratory  tests an d a disease assessment phy sical examination.  To confirm the response, 
a contrast -enhanced CT scan (or MRI, if CT scan with contrast is medically 
contraindicated) will be performed at Week 48 for all subjects.  Subjects will be evaluated 
using the 2008 Mod ified IWCLL NCI -WG criteria for Tumor Response with the addition 
of CT imaging (or MRI).   
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)
M15 -550 Protocol Amendment 0.02.01.01.01 (ROW)
EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
48
For determination of complete remission (CR), the CT scan and bone marrow are required 
to be negative, per the IWCLL NC I-WG criteria.  I t is recommended that the CT scan is 
performed first; if it does confirm a clinical response, then a bone marrow biopsy will be 
obtained.  If a CT scan is performed and does not confirm a clinical response, a bone 
marrow biops y should not be obtained.
If a subject exhibits clinical si gns of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
denovo enlargement of liver, spleen or l ymph nodes on phy sical examination) without an 
increase in ly mphocy tes meeting the progression of disease criteria, then additional 
assessments including contr ast-enhanced CT scan and/or bone marrow can be performed 
to confirm or rule out disease progression. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
For an y subject who has not experienced progressive disease (PD) at the time of 
permanent discontinuation of venetoclax, follow -up phone calls will continue until death, 
discontinuation from the study  or upon stud y completion.
Response criteria definition s are outlined in 2008 Modified I WCLL -WG Criteria for 
Tumor Response.  See Table 5.
For patients with onl y Partial Remission at Week 48 an additional CT and a bone marrow 
examination can be done between Week 48 and Week 108 to confirm CR if there is a 
possibility  that a patient is in Complete Remission based on laboratory  tests and a disease 
assessment phy sical examination.
NOTE:   Disease assessments ma y be performed approximately  7 day s prior to the 
scheduled visit.

49
Computed Tomography Scans (or Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
A CT scan with contrast will be accepted if previously performed within 35 days prior to 
the first dose of venetoclax.  Otherwise, a CT scan must be performed within the 
Screening window (28 days) for all subjects.  A CT scan will be performed for all subjects 
at Week 48 to confirm disease response.  Contrast -enhanced CT scans including neck, 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performe d to assess response to treatment.  A contrast -
enhanced MRI of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis with a non -contrast CT scan of the 
chest may  be used for subjects in whom a contrast CT is medically  contraindicated 
(i.e., subjects with a severe allergy  toCT contrast agents or subjects with impaired renal 
clearance).  Whichever method is used at Screening should be consistently used 
throughout the duration of the study. 
Any CT scan (or MRI) performed as standard of care throughout the stud y should be 
captured on the eCRF.
NOTE:   CT scans (or MRI ) may  be performed 7 day s prior to the scheduled visit.
Bone Marrow Aspirate and Biopsy
At baseline, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are not required; however results should 
be recorded if available.  If the subje ct achieves a CR by  clinical criteria and confirmatory  
CT scan, a bone marrow aspirate and biops y will be performed to confirm the CR.  
Whenever possible the bone marrow aspirate for biomarker MRD assessment should be 
split from this sample.  I f a CT scan is performed and does not confirm a CR, a bone 
marrow biops y should not be obtained. 
Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed as standard of care throughout the study  
should also be captured on an eCRF.

Subject Calendars/Diaries
For all subjects, subj ect calendars/diaries will be provided at the Week 20 visit.  Subjects 
will be instructed to bring their calendars/diaries back to the site to be reviewed at the 
Week 24 visit. 
Subjects will be instructed to record the date and time of each dose taken (indicating if 
any doses of study  drug are missed) from Week 20 to Week 24, and whether or not the 
dose was taken with a meal.  This information will be transcribed into the eCRF.
At the Week 24 visit, the calendars/diaries are to be returned to the site a nd appropriatel y 
filed with the subject's source documents for this study.
Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcome Measures
Quality  of life will be assessed using the following questionnaires:  the EQ -5D-5L the 
FACT -Leu and the FACIT -F.
Quality  of lif e will be assessed at baseline (Week 1, Day  1 prior to the first dose), Week 4, 
Week 12, Week 24, and then every  3 months until the end of study  treatment (Week 108).  
The Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires should be 
administered and completed prior to an y other study procedures being performed at these 
visits.  Refer to Section 5.3.7, Health Economic and Patient -Reported Out come Measures, 
for further information.
Final Visit
Upon treatment discontinuation (See Section 5.4.1 ), the reason(s) for discontinuation will 
be recorded in the eCRFs and a Final Visit will be performed.  The Final Visit procedures 
as listed in Appendix Dand Appendix Eshould be performed as soon as possible after 
study  drug discontinuation.
At the Final Visit, all used/unused study  drug and the subject's calendars/diaries, if 
applicable are t o be returned to the site and drug accountability  performed.

30-Day Safety Visit
A 30 -Day Safet y Follow -up Visit should be performed approximately  30 day s (± 3 days) 
following the last dose of venetoclax (to allow for AE collection 30 days following last 
dose of study  drug).  Refer to Appendix Dand Appendix Efor procedures to be 
performed.  
If a subject has an ongoing AE or an unresolved clinically  significant laboratory  result 
30days following last dose of study  drug, the site will attempt to provide follow -up until 
the AE has resolved to a ≤ Grade 1 or ba seline or it is the investigator's judgment that the 
event is unlikely  to resolve.  
Additionally , CT or MRI scans are not required, however if collected b y the site as 
standard of care, the data should be recorded in EDC.
Post-Treatment and Survival Asses sments 
After treatment discontinuation, subjects will be followed for disease progression (if 
progression has not already  occurred) and survival.  Post -treatment calls will be 
performed every  6 months until discontinuation from the study .  Survival inform ation 
(i.e., the date and cause of death, post -treatment cancer therapies, date of progression etc.) 
will be collected.  This period will continue for 2 years following discontinuation of 
venetoclax.
Extended Access Phase
In countries where venetoclax is n ot commercially available, subjects who continue to 
derive benefit after 2 years of treatment may be able to extend their treatment for up to 
2additional y ears.  If a subject in the extended access phase of this study continues to 
derive benefit from Vene toclax after the 2- year extension, then per PI 's assessment, 
subjects who are transferring to the venetoclax extension study, Study M19 -388, may  
remain in Extended Access for up to additional 1 year or until the extension study is 
approved and initiated at the site, whichever is sooner.  AbbVie will work with the

investigator on a case b y case basis to consider the potential continuation of venetoclax 
therap y.  The Extended Access Visits will include:
●Collection of Survival information
●AE/SAE/Con Med assess ment
●Study  drug reconciliation and dispensing
All other procedures should be performed as standard of care.  The specific study  
assessments to be performed during these visits are detailed in Appendix EStudy  
Activities.
Assignment of Subject Numbers
Subjects will be assigned unique consecutive subject numbers at screening, as described 
in Section 5.5.3.  The results of all screening evaluations must be within clinically  
acceptable limits, upon review by the investigator before a subject can be administered 
study  drug.  Subjects will not be enrolled in the st udy if laboratory  or other screening 
results are unacceptable.
5.3.1.2 Collection and Handling of Biomarker Research Samples
Biospecimens may  be utilized to evaluate known and/or novel disease -related or drug -
related biomarkers.  The biomarker rationale will be di scussed in the Biomarker Research 
Variables Section (Section 5.3.6).
Biomarker Samples
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Assessment
Peripheral blood for MRD will be collected from all subjects as outlined in Appendix D
and Appendix E.  
When confirming a CR or CRi status per the 2008 Modified I WCLL NCI -WG criteria 
with a bone marrow biopsy , whenever possible, a bone marrow aspirate should be

collected for MRD assessment.  The bone marrow aspirate should be split and a sample 
sent to the Central Laboratory.
All biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study -specific 
laboratory  manual.
AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the samples in a secure 
storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality .  The samples may  be 
retained while research on venetoclax, or drugs of this class, or this disease and related 
conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local 
requirement.
5.3.2 Drug Concentration Measurements
5.3.2.1 Collection of Samples for A nalysis
Blood samples for venetoclax and possible metabolite(s) will be collected by venipuncture 
per Appendix Dand Appendix E.  The date and time (to the nearest minute) of the last 
dose and second to last dose of venetoclax will be recorded on the eCRF.  The date and 
time (to the nearest minute) of each blood sampl e collection will be recorded on the 
sample requisition form.
Blood samples (3 mL) for venetoclax assay will be collected at the following time:
●Week 24 Day  1:  0 hour (pre -dose)
A total of 1 blood sample is planned to be collected per subject for venetoc lax PK 
analysis.  Refer to the study specific laboratory  manual for detailed instructions on sample

5.3.2.2 Measurement Methods
Plasma concentrations of venetoclax will be determined by the Drug Anal ysis Department 
at AbbVie u sing validated methods.  Plasma concentrations of other possible metabolites 
from venetoclax may  be determined with validated or non -validated methods.
5.3.3 Efficacy  Variables
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  of venetoclax monothe rapy 
in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic l ymphocy tic leukemia (CLL).  The primary  
efficacy  endpoint will be measured b y complete remission rate (CR + CRi) of the subjects 
who have not been previously  treated with B -cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi ) therap y, as 
assessed b y the investigator.
The secondary  objectives are to evaluate other efficacy parameters including the overall 
response rate (ORR), duration of overall response (DoR), time to progression, (TTP), 
progression -free survival (PFS), overa ll survival (OS), and the CR rate in BCRi treated 
subjects.
Additional secondary  objectives will be evaluated.  Health Economic and 
Patient -Reported Outcome Measures will include the EQ -5D-5L, the FACT- Leu and the 
FACIT -F.  Minimal residual disease (MRD) a nd the rate of MRD negativity  in the 
peripheral blood are assessed as exploratory  objectives in the peripheral blood and bone 
marrow (BM) b y flow cytometry , PCR and/or sequencing.
Analy ses of these endpoints are described in Section 8.0.
5.3.3.1 Primary  Variables
For disease assessments, response will be assessed by  the investigator based on analys is 
of clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  laboratory values) , disease assessment phy sical 
examination, CT scan including neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis (or MRI if CT with 
contrast is medicall y contraindicated); bone marrow aspirate are not required but results 
will be recorded if available.  Subjects will be evaluated against the 2008 Modified  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)

IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria for Tumor Response46with CT imaging (or MRI). A BM 
sample assessment is required to confirm CR.
At screening (baseline), all measurable disease must be documented b y laboratory testing 
(hematologic status), ph ysical examination, and CT scan.  All baseline evaluations should 
be performed as closely  aspossible to the beginning of treatment and not more than 
4weeks before the beginning of the treatment with the exception of the CT scan (or MRI) 
which will be accepted if previously performed within 35 day s prior to study  drug 
initiation.  During the stu dy, subjects will have a disease assessment at Week 24, Week 36 
and Week 48.  To confirm the response, a CT scan will be performed at Week 48 on all 
subjects.  For subjects with CR as response at Week 48, a BM sample is required to 
confirm the response.  
Methods of Measurement
Disease response and progression will be assessed by  anal ysis of peripheral blood, clinical 
examination, radiographic scans and bone marrow aspirate and biops y.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to c haracterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.
Details on the anal ysis of peripheral blood required to assess response are provided in 
Section 5.3.1.2 . 
A full disease assessment phy sical examination should be performed to assess the extent 
of disease involvement.  Phy sical examinations should include the evaluation of the 
presence and degree of enlarged l ymph nodes in two dimension (cervical, supraclavicular, 
axillary , inguinal and femoral nodes), hepatomegaly , and splenomegal y.  These should be 
noted on all examinations irrespective of being present or absent.  All measurements 
should be taken and recorded in metri c notation using a ruler or calipers.  Clinical lesions 
will only  be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., palpable ly mph 
nodes).  The diameter, in two planes, of the largest palpable nodes in each of the  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)

56
following sites should be measured:  cervical, supraclavicular, axillary , inguinal, and 
femoral.  The presence of hepatomegal y and splenomegaly  should be performed.
The 12 largest bi -dimensional lesions should be recorded in the eCRF.  
●Target Lesions:  A maximum of 12 target lesions may b e selected (up to 
6nodal and 6 extra nodal).  Target nodal lesions must be abnormal (> 1.5 cm 
in LDi [Longest Diameter] at baseline), clearly measurable and suitable for 
consistent, reproducible measurement in at least two perpendicular 
dimensions.  Targe t extra nodal lesions must be > 1 cm in two perpendicular 
diameters at baseline.
● Non- Target Lesions:  Sites will be classified as non -target lesions where 
disease is present but not selected for target lesions.  A maximum of 
10 non- target lesions can be se lected.  Non- target nodal lesions must be 
abnormal (> 1.5 cm in LDi at baseline).  Non -target extra nodal lesions must 
be > 1 cm in two perpendicular diameters.  Nodal and extra nodal lesio ns that 
were not selected as target lesions at baseline can be foll owed as non- target 
lesions.
Computed tomograph y (CT) is the preferred method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment.  CT scans (with contrast) should include neck, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis scans.  CT scans for response assessment may  be limited to areas of prior 
involvement only , if required by  local regulatory  authorities.  A contrast -enhanced MRI of 
the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis with a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may  be used 
if CT with contrast is medically  contraindicated ( e.g., severe contrast allergy ).  If MRIs 
are used instead of CT scans, MRI s should be used consistently  throughout the study .  
Conventional CT and MRI  should be performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguousl y.  Spiral CT should be perfo rmed by  use of 5 mm contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm; this specification applies to the regions of the neck, chest, 
abdomen and pelvis at baseline and follow -ups.  The 12 largest bi -dimensional lesions 
should be recorded in the eCRF (6 nodal and 6 extra nodal).

Immunohistochemistry  (IHC) should be performed to define whether these 
nodules are composed of primarily  T cells or l ymphocy tes other than CLL 
cells, or CLL cells.
Complete Remission with Incomplete Marrow Recovery (CRi)
Subjects who fulfill the criteria for CR (including bone marrow) but who have persistent 
cytopenia (anemia or thrombocy topenia or neutropenia) apparentl y unrelated to CLL but 
related to drug toxicity  will be considered CRi.  The marr ow evaluation described above 
should be performed with scrutiny and not show any clonal infiltrate.
Partial Remission (PR)
To be considered a PR at least 2 of the following must be met:
●≥ 50% decrease in peripheral blood ly mphocy te count from the pretreatm ent 
baseline value.
●≥ 50% reduction in ly mphadenopathy .
●≥ 50% reduction in the size of the liver and/or spleen (if abnormal prior to 
therap y).
In addition at least one of the following criteria must be met:
●Neutrophils > 1,500/µL  or ≥ 50% improvement over baseline.
●Platelets > 100,000/µL  or ≥ 50% improvement over baseline.
●Hemoglobin > 11.0 g/dL or ≥ 50% improvement over baseline without 
transfusions or exogenous growth factors.

● Appearance of an y new lesion, such as enlarged ly mph nodes (> 1.5 cm), 
splenomegaly , hepatomegal y, or other organ infiltrates.  An increase b y 50% 
or more in greatest determined diameter of an y previous site.
●An increase in the previously  noted enlargement of the liver or spleen b y 50% 
or more or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly  or splenomegal y.
●An increase in the number of blood ly mphocy tes by  50% or more with at least 
5,000 B l ymphocy tes per microliter.  The increase should be assessed against 
the best response while on study .
●Transf ormation to a more aggressive histology  (e.g., Richter 's Syndrome).  
Whenever possible, this diagnosis should be confirmed by l ymph node biopsy .  
For subjects experiencing disease progression due to Richter 's Syndrome while 
on study , supplemental d ata may  be collected.
●Occurrence of cy topenia (neutropenia, anemia or thrombocy topenia) 
attributable to CLL.
5.3.4 Safety  Variables
The following safet y evaluations will be performed during the stud y:  serious adverse 
event and adverse event monitoring including AEs of special interest (Section 6.1.1.4 ), 
vital signs, phy sical examination, and laboratory  assessments.  Certain ty pes of events 
require immediate repor ting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 6.1.5.  Safety  will be 
monitored on an ongoing basis and summarize periodically  in aggregate safety rep orts and 
end of study .
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax, including the apparent clearance (CL/F), will 
be determined using a population PK modeling approach.  Additional parameters may  be 
calculated if useful in the inte rpretation of the data.

5.3.6 Biomarker Variables
Biomarker Research Variables
Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow biospecimens will be collected to conduct 
exploratory  anal yses to investigate biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be anal yzed 
may include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, proteins, lipids or metabolites.  Cells 
isolated from the peripheral blood/bone marrow may  be analy zed to assess specific 
genetic mutations within the tumor cells, or to track the tumor cells to determine the 
presence of minimal residual disease.  Additionally , the expression levels (RNA or 
protein) of molecules involved in controlling the apoptosis machinery, including but not 
limited to BCL -2 family  members, may  also be correlated with efficacy .  
Evaluations may  include analyzing biomarkers related to the pathway (s) targeted by  the 
study  drug or those believed to be related to the disease or to drug response.  The 
information learned from anal yzing these samples may  be used to investigate factors 
influencing response to treatment, scientific questions related to CLL, and/or in the 
development of new therapies and diagnostic tests.  The results of biomarker testing may 
not be included with the study  summary .
5.3.7 Health Economic and Patient -Reported Outcome Measures
5.3.7.1 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy –Leukemia 
(FACT-Leu) Questionnaire
The FACT -Leu is a 44 -item, leukemia -specific questionnaire designed to assess subject 
health- related quality  of life (HRQoL) and leukemia -specific s ymptoms using a 'core' set 
of questions (Fu nctional Assessment of Cancer Therap y-General; FACT- G), as well as a 
cancer site -specific leukemia subscale.34  The FACT -G is a 27 -item compilation of 
general questions scored on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 = "not at all" to 4 = "very  
much."35  The items are divided into 4 primary HRQOL  domains:  Phy sical Well -being 
(7items; score range, 0 –28), Social/Family  Well -being (7 items; score range, 0 –28), 
Emotional Well- being (6 items; score range, 0 –24), Functional Well -being (7 items; 
score r ange, 0 – 28).36

M15 -550 Protocol Amendment 0.02.01.01.01 (ROW)
EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
63
The leukemia -specific subscale consists of 17 items (score range, 0 – 68) that asses s 
subject concerns relating to leukemia.  Three summary scales:  FACT -Trial Outcome 
Index (score range, 0 – 124) a summary  scale composed of the Phy sical Well -being, 
Functional Well -being, and leukemia -specific subscales; FACT -G (score range, 0 – 108) 
and the FACT -Leukemia Total (score range, 0 – 176) can also be calculated.  Higher 
scores are reflective of better HRQOL.  Minimally important differences (MI Ds) have 
been identified for the different FACT -Leu scales:  Phy sical Well -being, 2 – 3 points; 
Social /Family  Well -being, not available; Emotional Well- being, 2 points; Functional 
Well- being, 2 –3 points; FACT- G, 3 – 7 points; Leukemia -specific subscale, 4 – 7 points; 
FACT -Trial Outcome Index, 5 –6 points; and FACT- Leukemia Total, 6 –12 points. 
Scores will be summarized descriptivel y at each assessment.  The impact of treatment on 
quality  of life over time will be assessed b y calculating the change in scores from baseline 
at each assessment time point.  Scores will be calculated according to the FACT- Leu 
scoring manual. 
5.3.7.2 Functional A ssessment of Chronic Illness Therapy  –Fatigue 
(FACIT -F) Scale
The FACIT -F measures fatigue and its effect on functioning and daily  activities.37  The 
FACIT -F has 13 items answered on a 5- point rating scale based on a 7 -day recall period.  
Scores range from 0 to 52, with lower scores reflecting greater fatigue.  The instrume nt 
has shown good reliability and validity  based on analy ses of the general population in the 
United States, subjects with cancer, and subjects with rheumatoid arthritis.37-39  The MI D 
of the FACIT -F scale has been determined to be 3 points.40
Scores will be summarized descriptivel y at each assessment. The impact of treatment on 
fatigue over time will be assessed b y calculating the change in score from baseline at each 
assessment time point.  Scores will be calculated according to the FACIT -F scoring 
manual.

5.3.7.3 EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L)
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L) is a generic preference instrument that has been 
validated in numerous populations.41,42  The EQ -5D-5L has five dimensions:  mobility , 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression.  These dimensions are 
measured on a five level scale:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems, and extreme problems.  The scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a 
single utility  index score rangin g from zero (0.0) to 1 (1.0) representing the general health 
status of the individual.  The EQ -5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale (VAS) to 
assess the subject's overall health.  The MID for the EQ- 5D utility  index score in cancer 
subjects is 0.08, an d the MI D for EQ -5D VAS is 7.43,44
Each of the five dimensions of the EQ -5D-5L, the VAS and overall utility  score will be 
calculated using the EuroQol scoring manual, and summarized (mean, std. dev., med ian) 
at each assessment.  The impact of treatment over time will be assessed b y calculating the 
change in score from baseline at each assessment time point. 
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study  and/or study  drug treatment at any  
time.  I n addition, the investigator may  discontinue a subject from study  drug treatment at 
any time if the investigator considers it necessary  for an y reason including:
● The inves tigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject
●Subject 's response to therapy  is unsatisfactory , as evidenced b y progression of 
disease while on stud y drug
●The subject requires other cancer treatment (e.g. ,radiotherap y, cancer -related 
surgery  as a result of tumor progression, alternate anti -neoplastic agents) 
during the stud y period
●unacceptable toxicity
●The subject becomes pregnant while on the study

●drug/ protocol non- compliance
The investigator will inform AbbVie prior to discontinuing a subject from the study b y 
contacting the Clinical Team Leader as identified in Section 7.0.  All subjects will b e 
included for anal ysis of safet y data.  Subjects who withdraw from the stud y will not be 
replaced unless they  are not evaluable.
Subjects will continue to be followed for unresolved AEs and survival information for an y 
subject who has not experienced PD a t the time of venetoclax discontinuation.  
Final Visit
Upon study  drug discontinuation and/or upon discontinuation from the study , the 
reason(s) for discontinuation will be recorded in electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and 
a final visit will be perform ed.  The final visit procedures as listed in Appendix Dshould 
be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation from study drug.
30-Day Safet y Follow -Up Visit
A 30 -Day Safet y Follow -up Visit should be performed approximately  30 day s (± 3 days) 
following the last dose of venetoclax.  The 30 day  safet y follow up procedures listed in 
Appendix Dshould be performed.
Post Treatment and Survival Follow -Up Calls
For subjects who discontinue venetoclax therap y, but do not discontinue the study, post 
treatment follow -up calls will be performed ever y 6 months (± 7 day s)for survival 
information (i.e., disease progression, the date and cause of death, post -treatment cancer 
therapies, etc.) and will be collected via telephone calls for a period of 2 years and 
recorded in the eCRFs.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of E ntire Study
AbbVie may  terminate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at an y study  site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended

termination.  The investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety re asons, AbbVie will immediately  
notify  the investigator b y telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments A dministered
Venetoclax tablets should be taken orally once daily with a meal and water in the mo rning 
at approximately  the same time each day .  Venetoclax tablets should be swallowed whole 
and not chewed, crushed, or broken prior to swallowing.
If the subject misses a dose of venetoclax within 8 hours of the time it is taken, the subject 
should take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day  and resume the normal 
daily  dosing schedule the following day .  If a subject misses a dose by more than 8 hours, 
the subject should not take the missed dose and resume the normal dail y dosing schedule 
thefollowing day .
In cases of vomiting after taking venetoclax, no additional dose (tablets) should be taken 
that day .  The next dose should be taken at the usual time the following day.
5.5.2 Identity  of Investigational Product

5.5.2.1 Packaging and Labeling
The venetoclax tablets will be packaged in blister packs during the dose -titration phase 
and in high densit y polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bottles thereafter to accommodate the 
study  design.  Each container will be labeled as required per country  requirements.  
Labels must remain affixed to the container.
5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drug
The venetoclax supplied in this study  is for investigational use onl y, and must only  be 
used within this study .  All study  drug must be maintained under adequate securit y and 
stored under conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or returned to 
AbbVie or r epresentative.
The tablets must be stored at a controlled room temperature of 15° to 25°C (59° to 77°F).
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects are assigned to the same treatment group in this single arm study.  Subjects 
will be allocated a unique consecutive subject number at Screening.  Subject numbers will 
consist of 5 digits (XXX01), with the first three digits denoting site numbe r and the last  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)

EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
68
2digits as the subject number, beginning with 01.  All subjects will be enrolled using an 
(Interactive Response Technology ) IRT.  Before the study  is initiated, each site will be 
provided with the I RT user instructions, which provides direc tion on how to use the IRT 
via the Web or the telephone.  Since this is an open -label study , subjects will maintain the 
same subject number, regardless of the number of re -screens and through the duration of 
the study .  The site, in conjunction with the Sp onsor, will be responsible for assignment of 
all unique subject numbers at Screening and dose assignments if the subject is not a 
screening failure.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Venetoclax will be administered orall y once dail y (QD) beginn ing with a dose -titration 
phase.  As shown in Figure 2, the initial venetoclax dose is 20 mg QD.  After 1 week of 
treatment at 20 mg QD, the dose will be escalated to 50 mg QD followed by  subsequent 
increases, each after 1 week, to 100 mg QD, 200 mg QD and the maximum dose of 
400mg QD.  The maximum dose of venetoclax for this protocol will not exceed 400 mg 
per day .  The 5 -week dose -titration phase is designed to graduall y reduce tumor burden 
(debulk) and decrease the risk of tumor lysis s yndrome.  All study subjects will be 
categorized at Screening according to their risk for developing TL S.  Their dose 
management, including during the dose -titration p hase, will be conducted in accordance 
with their risk for developing TLS (see Section 6.1.8.1 ) and may  include dose delay  
and/or dose reduction as required for proph ylaxis and management of TL S.

The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with 
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
To document compliance with the treatment regimen, subjects will be instructed to return 
all unused tablets and/or containers, even if empt y and an y other stud y related items as 
necessary , to the study  coordinator at scheduled study  visits.  Compliance will be 
monitored and documented by  the study  coordinator on the appropriate form.  The study  
coordinator will question the subject regarding adherence to the dosing regimen, record 
the number of tablets and/or containers returned, the date returned and determine 
treatment compliance before dispensing new venetoclax to the subject.  Compliance 
below 80% will require counseling of the subject by  study  site personnel.

5.5.7 Drug A ccountability
Investigator or representative will verify that study drug supplies are received intact and in 
the correct amounts.  Do cumentation of the receipt of supplies will be supported by a 
signed and dated Proof of Receipt or similar shipping document in IRT.  A current 
(running) and accurate inventory  of venetoclax will be kept by  the site and will include lot 
number, Proof of Re ceipt number(s), container numbers, blister pack numbers, subject 
initials, initials of person who dispensed the drug and the date study drug was 
administered for each subject.  An overall accountability  of study  drug will be performed 
and verified b y AbbV ie monitor(s) throughout the study  and at the study  site closeout 
visit.  All study  drug unit doses must be inventoried, accounted for, and returned to 
AbbVie or destro yed per instructions from AbbVie and according to local regulations.  
All original conta iners (containing partiall y used or unused study drug) will be returned to 
AbbVie according to instructions from AbbVie or the designated monitor(s).  If 
pre-arranged between AbbVie and the site, destruction of used and unused study  drug 
containers will be performed at the site.  Empty  containers will be destro yed at the site.  
Labels must remain attached to the containers.
The investigator and/or named sub- investigators agree not to supply  study  medication to 
any persons not enrolled in the study .
5.6 Discussi on and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
Study  M15 -550 is being conducted primarily to assess the efficacy  of venetoclax 
monotherap y.  This study is a single -arm trial; therefore, there is no control grou p or 
treatment blinding.  The study  will be conducted at multiple study  centers globally  to 
ensure a broad representation of the patient population and clinical care settings. 
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory  procedures will be utilized in this study . 
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)

EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
71
5.6.3 Suitability  of Subject Population
Venetoclax monotherap y has shown favorable activity in relapsed/refractory CLL subjects 
including subjects with 17p deletions.  Venetoclax is expected to be as active in subjects 
selected for TP53 mutations as these patient populations overlap and the oncogenic effect 
of both genetic defects occurs via p53 abrogation.  I n addition, venetoclax has shown 
activity  in subjects with relapsed or refractory  CLL who have been previously  treated with 
a B-cell receptor inhibitor.  These subjects can participate in this study  and may  have 
relapsed or be refractory  to ibrutinib, or idelalisib containing regimen.
All subjects enrolled in the study will have adequate performance status and hemato logic, 
renal and hepatic function to undergo venetoclax treatment.  
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
Venetoclax dosing will be introduced at an initial dose of 20 mg QD and escalated to a 
final dose of 400 mg QD.  The maximum dose of venetoclax for this pr otocol will not 
exceed 400 mg per day .  The daily  dose will be titrated in the following weekly  
increments, as tolerated:  20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg.  The 400 mg final 
dose was selected for the ongoing, Phase 2 stud y of venetoclax monotherap y in 
relapsed/refractory  CLL subjects with 17p deletion (Study  M13 -982) based on 
time-to-response and logistic regression modelling of data from CLL/SLL subjects 
enrolled in the Phase 1 Study  M12 -175.
The initial 20 mg venetoclax dose and weekl y incrementa l increases in the dose -titration 
phase were implemented for Study  M13 -982 to reduce the risk of TLS.  Preliminary  
safet y data from that study indicate the initial dose, the dose -titration phase and the final 
maximum dose are tolerable.

Complaints associated with any  component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2).  Fo r adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.1.1
through 6.1.6.  For pro duct complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the stud y.  The investigator will assess and record 
any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/sy mptom, severity , time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), r elationship of the 
adverse event to study  drug, and any  action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events 
considered as having "no reasonable possibility " of being associated with study  drug, the 
investigator will provide an "Other" cause of the event.  For adverse events to be 
considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse 
events, whether in response to a query , observed by  site personnel, or reported 
spontaneously  by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, wh ether or not the event is considered causally  related to the use of the product. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)
M15 -550 Protocol Amendment 0.02.01.01.01 (ROW)
EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
73
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  A ny 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adve rse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 Toxicity  
Management) or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
For this protocol, disease progression is an efficacy endpoint.  These data will be captured 
as efficacy  assessment data only .  Thus, events that are clearly consistent with the 
expected pattern of progression of the underl ying disease (such as transformation to more 
aggressive histology ) will result in discontinuation from the study  and should not be 
recorded as adverse events but reported on the Study Complet ion eCRF.  However, if a 
subject experiences an adverse event (e.g., pneumonia, pyrexia, fatigue, etc.) and is also 
found to have disease progression, report the adverse event.  If there is an y uncertaint y as 
to whether an event is due to disease progressi on, it should be reported as an adverse 
event.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has be en pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is bein g done, will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as an y AE reported by a subject with onset or 
worsening from the time that the first dose of venetoclax is administered until 30 day s 
have elapsed following discontinuation of venetoclax administration.

6.1.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious 
adverse event.
Death of S ubject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality  if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would ha ve 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for an y 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that su bstantially  
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study 
subject.  Disability  is not intended to include experiences of 
relativel y minor medical significance such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but 
based on medical judgment ma y jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent an y 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, 
life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of 
hospitalization, congenital anomal y, or persistent or 
signific ant disability /incapacity ).  Additionally , any  elective 
or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, bl ood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or 
the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.  Deaths related to disease progression will 
not be recorded as serious adverse events (see Section 6.1.2.1.1 ).  
Hospitalization of a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV h ydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophy laxis will not be captured as an SAE, unless there is an 
additional reason for hospitalization or an additional criterion for seriousness other than 
hospitali zation (e.g., abnormal post -dose TL S laboratories that necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, etc.).
Hospitalization of a subject following the 30 -Day Safety  Follow -Up visit due to a 
subsequent line of therapy will not be captured as a SAE.
6.1.1.3 Adverse Events Commonly  Associated with CLL Study 
Population and/or Progression of CLL
Certain AEs are anticipated to occur in the stud y population at some frequency 
independent of drug exposure.  Such events include known consequences of CLL 
(e.g., symptoms, disease progression) and events unlikely  to be related to the underl ying  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)
M15 -550 Protocol Amendment 0.02.01.01.01 (ROW)
EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
76
disease un der investigation but common in the study  population independent of drug 
therap y (e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderl y population).
These events are listed in Appendix I.
These AEs may  occur alone or in various combinations and are considered expected for 
reporting purposes for this protocol.
Cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocy topenia) are part of the natural history  of 
CLL.  Persistent cytopenias at the same CTCAE grade as reported at baseline are not to be 
captured as adverse events, unless they  fulfill a seriousness criteria, result in permanent 
discontinuation of a study drug, or the investigator had an identifiable cause other than the 
underly ing disease.  However, all laboratory  data should be entered regardless of whether 
an adverse event is reported.
Although exempted from expedited reporting to certain Health Authorities and ECs/I RBs 
as individual cases, if an event commonly asso ciated with CLL or progression of CLL 
meets seriousness criteria, it must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site being 
made aware of the SAE (as defined in Section 6.1.5 ).  However, if the event was 
unequivocall y due to disease progression, it should not be reported as an adverse event 
even if serious or fatal.  For deaths related to disease progression, the date and cause of 
death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form, but the death will not be 
expedited as an individual case safet y report (ICSR) to regulatory authorities.
6.1.1.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest
TLS and neutropenia are identified risks.  Serious Infection is a potential risk. 
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each AE according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03.  If 
a reported AE increases in severit y, the initial AE should be given an outcome date and a 
new AE must be reported on a different onset date than the end date of the previous 
adverse event to reflect the change in severit y.  The dates on the AEs cannot overlap.  For  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)
M15 -550 Protocol Amendment 0.02.01.01.01 (ROW)
EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
77
all reported SAEs that increase in severity , the supplemental eCRFs also need to be 
updated to reflect an y changes due to the increase i n severity . 
For AEs not captured b y the NCI  CTCAE, the following should be used:
Grade 1 The adverse event is transient and easil y tolerated by the subject (mild).
Grade 2 The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities (moderate).
Grade 3 The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's 
usual activities and may  be incapacitating (moderate to severe).
Grade 4 The adverse event is life -threatening requiring urgent intervention 
(severe).
Grade 5 The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe).
6.1.2.1 Adverse Events Expected Due to Study -Related Endpoints
6.1.2.1.1 Deaths 
For this protocol, overall survival is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol -specified adverse even t reporting period (see Section 6.1.4) that are attributed b y 
the investigator solel y to progression of CLL should be recorded ONLY on the Study  
Completion eCRF.  All other on- study  deaths, regardless of relationship to study  drug, 
must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately  reported to the Sponsor 
(see Section 6.1.5).  Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The 
event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as 
the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generall y, only one such event 
should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should be used only  for the occurrence of an 
abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a subject with or without 
preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour after the onset of acute s ymptoms or, i n the case 
of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the subject was last seen alive and stable.  
If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
"unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  I f the cause of  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)

EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
78
death later becomes available (e.g., after autops y), "unexplained death" should be replaced 
by the established cause of death.  During survival follow -up, deaths attributed to 
progression of CLL should be recorded onl y on the Survival eCRF.
6.1.2.1.2 Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Disease
Events that are clearl y consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underly ing disease are also considered an expected outcome for this study  and will not be 
subject to expedited reporting.
6.1.3 Relationsh ip to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clini cal judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality  assessments, events ass essed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the inv estigator has not reported causality  or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug is 
given, an "Other Cause" of event must be provided by th e investigator for the SAE.

6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events reported from the time of venetoclax administration until 30 days, 
following discontinuation of venetoclax administration have elapsed will be collected, 
whether solicited or sp ontaneously  reported by the subject.  In addition, protocol related 
serious adverse events and nonserious adverse events will be collected from the time the 
subject signed the study -specific informed consent.
All AEs should be followed until resolution, re turn to baseline or determined to be stable 
per the investigator.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 3.

* Only if considered by the investigator to be causally related to study -required procedures.
6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
inves tigator will notify  Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made 
aware of the serious adverse event b y entering the serious adverse event data into the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to t he site 
having access to the RAVE®system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non -CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical

Directive 2001/20/EC.  The reference document used for SUSAR reporting in the EU 
countri es will be the most current version of the Investigator's Brochure. 
6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the study  must 
be discontinued (Section 5.4.1 ).
All subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken throughout 
the study  and for 30 days afte r the last dose of venetoclax.  Male subjects should be 
informed that contraceptive measures should be taken by their female partners. 
Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy  will be collected.  In the event of a pregnancy  occurring in the partner of an 
enrolled subject, written informed consent for release of medical information from the 
partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy -specific information and 
the pregnancy  will be followed to outcome.
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not considered an adverse event.  The medical outcome of 
either mother or infant, meeting an y serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomal y is considere d a serious adverse event and must 
be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.7 Data Monitoring Committee
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safet y data intermittently according to 
the DMC charter.  Details of t he DMC review are presented in the DMC charter.  The 
separate charter has been created to provide detailed descriptions of the schedule of

analyses and the DMC meetings.  DMC membership, responsibilities and the description 
of the data coordinating center are documented in the charter.   
6.1.8 Toxicity  Management
6.1.8.1 Prophy laxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Sy ndrome
Venetoclax can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 
5-week dose -titration phase.  Changes in electroly tes consis tent with TL S that require 
prompt management can occur as earl y as 6 
–8 hours following the first dose of 
venetoclax and at each dose increase. 
Risk Assessment for tumor ly sis sy ndrome:   The risk of TL S is a continuum based on 
multiple factors, including tumor burden and comorbidities.  Subjects with high tumor 
burden (e.g., an y lymph node with a diameter ≥5 cm or high absolute ly mphocy te count 
[ALC >25×109/L]) are a greater risk of TLS.  Reduced renal function (creatinine 
clearance [CrCl] < 80 mL/min ) further increases the risk.  The risk may  decrease as tumor 
burden decreases with venetoclax treatment. 
Additional comorbidities may further increase the risk for TL S.
Prior to initiating venetoclax, tumor burden assessment, including radiographic evalu ation 
(refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study  Procedures –CT scans) must be performed for all subjects 
during Screening.  The full blood chemistry /hematology  panel (refer to Table 4Clinical 
Laboratory  Tests) should be performed in all subjects during the Screening period in order 
to assess eligibility  and to correct pre -existing abnormalities. 
If the chemistry /hematology  panel was assessed more than 72 hours prior to the 1stdose of 
venetoclax, an additional full lab panel should be performed and reviewed within 72 hours 
prior to dosing in order to make a treatment decision.
Prophy laxis for tumor lysis sy ndrome:   The prophy laxis measures listed below should be 
followed.  More intensive measures (including hospitalization) should be employ ed as 
overall risk increases:  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)
M15 -550 Protocol Amendment 0.02.01.01.01 (ROW)
EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
83
Hydration:  
Subjects should be adequately  hydrated prior to starting treatment with venetoclax and 
during the dose -titration phase.  The recommended volume is 1.5 to 2.0 L  
(approximately  6 to 8 glasses) of water each day .  Subjects should be instructed to 
drink water starting 2 days before and on the day  of the first dose, and every time the 
dose is increased.  Int ravenous (IV) fluids should be administered as indicated based 
on overall risk of TLS or for those who cannot maintain an adequate level of oral 
hydration.  For subjects for whom volume overload is considered a significant risk, 
hospitalization should be c onsidered.
Anti-hyperuricemic agents:   Anti -hyperuricemic agents should be administered 2 to 
3days prior to starting treatment with venetoclax and may  be continued through the 
titration phase. 
Laboratory  Assessments:
PRE -DOSE LABS
Prior to the initial do se of venetoclax, for all subjects:
●During the Screening Period:   For all subjects, the chemistry/hematology panel 
(see Table 4Clinical Laboratory  Tests) is required.
○Pre-existing abnormalities should be corrected
●Within 72 hours of Week 1 Day  1:  If the screening labs were more than 72h 
before the planned first dose , the chemistry /hematology  panel should be repeated.  
These results should be reviewed before dosing.
○Labs should be assessed and pre -existing abnormalities should be corrected
●On the day  of Week 1 Day  1:  Before dosing, the chemistry /hematology  panel 
should be drawn.  The results of the labs drawn on Week 1 Day  1 need to be 
reviewed prior to dosing IFan additional lab within 72 hours of the initial dose at 
Week 1 Day  1 was not drawn AND reviewed.   
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)
M15 -550 Protocol Amendment 0.02.01.01.01 (ROW)
EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
84
Prior to each subsequent dose increase, for all subjects :
●Within 72 hours of each subsequent dose increase:   The chemistry /hematology  
panel should be repeated.  The results should be reviewed prior to dose increasing.
●Prior to dosing, on the day of each subsequent dose increase:   Before dosing, the 
chemistry /hematology  panel should be drawn.  The results of the labs drawn on 
Day 1 of each dose increase need to be reviewed prior to dosing IFan additional 
lab draw within 72 hours of the dose increase were not drawn AND reviewed.  
POST -DOSE LABS:
For all subject s, the chemistry /hematology  panel (refer to Table 4Clinical Laboratory  
Tests) should be monitored at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours after the first dose of 
venetoclax (20 mg) and after the first dose increase (50 mg).  Electroly te 
abnormalities should be corrected promptl y.  The next venetoclax doses (Day 2 20 mg 
venetoclax dose and Day 2 50 mg venetoclax dose) should not be administered until 
the 24 hour lab results have been evaluated.  Electroly te abnormalities should be 
corrected promptl y.  For subjects who continue to be at risk of TLS, the same lab 
monitoring schedule (i.e., 6 to 8 hour and 24- hr post dose) should be followed at the 
subsequent dose i ncreases.
This monitoring is also recommended during the re -initiation of the therapy after a 
dose interruption.
Hospitalization:  Based on investigator assessment, some subjects, especially those at 
greater risk of TLS may  require hospitalization on the d ay of the first dose of 
venetoclax for more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring through the first 24 hours.  
Hospitalization should be considered for subsequent dose increases based on 
reassessment of risk.

6.1.8.2 Dose Modifications Based on Toxicities
Dosing i nterruption and/or dose reduction may  be required.  See Table 7for dose 
modifications for hematologic and other toxicities related to venetoclax.  For subjects who 
have had a dosing interruption greater than 1 week during the first 5weeks of dose 
titration or greater than 2 weeks when at the dail y dose of 400 mg, TL S risk should be 
reassessed to determine if restarting at a reduced dose is necessary (e .g., all or some levels 
of the dose titration).
Tumor Lysis Syndrome
If a subject experiences blood chemistry changes suggestive of TL S, the following day 's 
venetoclax dose should be withheld.  If resolved within 24 to 48 hours of last dose, 
treatment with venetoclax can be resumed at the same dose.  For events of clinical TL S or 
blood chemistry  changes requiring more than 48 hours to resolve, treatment should be 
resumed at a reduced dose (see Table 7and Table 8).  When resuming treatment with 
venetoclax after interruption due to TL S, the instructions for Prophy laxis for tumor ly sis 
syndrome should be followed.
Other Toxicities
Treatment with venetoc lax should be withheld for any  grade 3 or 4 non -haematological, 
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with infection or fever, or grade 4 haematological toxicities, 
except ly mphopenia.  To reduce the risk of infection associated with neutropenia, 
granulocy te-colon y stimulating factor (G -CSF) may  be administered with venetoclax if 
clinically indicated.  Once the toxicity  has resolved to grade 1 or baseline level (recovery ), 
therap y with venetoclax may be restarted at the same dose.  If the toxicity recurs, and for 
any subsequent occurrences, the dose reduction guidelines in Table 7and Table 8should 
be followed when resuming treatment with venetoclax following resolution.  A larger 
dose reduction may  occur at the discretion of the investigator.  For subjects who require 
dose reductions to less than 100 mg for more than 2 weeks due to adverse events, 
discontinuation of venetoclax should be considered.

a. During the dose titration phase, continue the reduced dose for 1 week before increasing the dose.
Dose Modifications for Use with CYP3A Inhibitors
Concomitant use of venetoclax with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors increases 
venetoclax exposure and may  increase the risk for TL S at initiation and during the 
dose-titration phase.   Concomitant use of venetoclax with strong CYP3A inhibitors at 
initiation and during the dose -titration phase is contraindicated. 
Concomitant use of venetoclax with moderate CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during 
the dose -titration phase should be avoided.  Alternative treatments should be considered.  
If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, the initiation and titration doses of 
venetoclax should be reduced b y at least 50%.  Subjects should be monitored more closel y 
for signs of toxicities. 
For subjects who have completed the dose -titration phase and are on a steady  daily dose 
of venetoclax, the venetoclax dose should be reduced b y at least 50% when used 
concomitantly  with moderate CYP3A inhibitors and by  at least 75% when used 
concomitantly  with strong CYP3A inhibitors.  Subjects should be monitored more closel y 
for signs of toxicities.  The venetoclax dose that was used prior to initiating the CYP3A 
inhibitor should be resumed 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of the CYP3A inhibitor.

Missed Dose
If a subject misses a dose of venetoclax within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the 
subject should take the missed dose as soon as possible and resume the normal daily  
dosing schedule.  If a subject misses a dose b y more than 8 hours, the subject should not 
take the missed dose and should resume the usual dosing schedule the following day.
If a subject vomits following dosing, no additional dose should be taken that day.  The 
next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time the following day .
6.1.8.3 Management of Neutropenia
Nonclinical and clinical experience indicates that venetoclax may cause neutropenia.  
Subjects with a history  of neutropenia who have received multiple prior therapies and/or 
have significant bone marrow involvement may  be at a particularl y high risk.
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia has been reported in subjects treated with venetoclax.  Complete 
blood counts should be monitored throughout the treatment period.  Dose interruptions or 
dose reductions are recommended for subjects with sev ere neutropenia.  Supportive 
measures including antimicrobials for an y signs of infection and proph ylactic use of 
growth factors (e.g., G -CSF) should be considered. 
6.1.8.4 Immunization 
Live attenuated vaccines should not be administered prior to, during, or after treatment 
with venetoclax until B -cell recovery  occurs.  The safet y and efficacy of immunization 
with live attenuated vaccines during or following venetoclax therap y have not been 
studied.  Patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effect ive.
6.1.8.5 Management of Hematologic Toxicities Other Than 
Neutropenia or Ly mphopenia 
Venetoclax treatment should be withheld for an y Grade 4 hematologic toxicity .  Once the 
toxicity  has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level (recovery ), venetoclax may  be re -started 
at the same dose.  If the toxicity  recurs, the dose reduction guidelines in Table 8should be

followed when resuming study  treatment following re solution.  Additional dose 
reductions may  occur at the discretion of the ph ysician.
6.1.8.6 Management of Non -Hematologic Toxicity
Venetoclax treatment should be withheld for an y clinically  relevant ≥ Grade 3 
non-hematologic toxicity .  Once the toxicity  has resolv ed to Grade 1 or baseline level 
(recovery ), venetoclax may  be re -started at the same dose.  If the toxicity  recurs, the dose 
reduction guidelines in Table 8should be followed when resuming stud y treatment 
following resolution.  Additional dose reductions may occur at the discretion of the 
physician.

and weight will be summarized with means, medians, standard deviations and r anges.  
Frequencies and percentages will be provided for gender and race.
8.1.1.2 Medical Histories
Frequencies and percentages will be summarized for each medical history parameter.
8.1.2 Efficacy  Endpoints
8.1.2.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoints
The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be complete remission rate (CR + CRi) of the subjects 
who have not been previously  treated with BCRi therap y defined as the proportion of 
subjects achieving a CR or CRi as their best response (per the investigator assessment) 
based on I WCLL NCI -WG criteria .
In addition, the ninety -five percent (95%) confidence interval based on binomial 
distribution will be constructed for the calculated CR rate.
The assessment of response will be performed when all subjects enrolled have completed 
their Week 48 disease ass essment, or after all enrolled subjects have discontinued 
venetoclax, whichever is earlier.  Subjects who have not achieved complete remission 
(CR + CRi) prior to this time will be considered to be non- responders in the calculation of 
CR rate.
8.1.2.2 Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints
Key secondary  efficacy  endpoints will include overall response rate, duration of response, 
time to progression, progression- free survival, overall survival, and the CR rate in 
previously  BCRi treated subjects.

93
ORR will be assessed as the proportion of subjects with an overall response (CR + CRi + 
nPR + PR) based on the IWCLL NC I-WG criteria.  The ninety -five percent (95%) 
confidence interval based on binomial distribution will be constructed for the calculated 
CR rate.
Duration of response will be defined as the number of day s from the date of first response 
(CR, CRi, nPR, or PR) to the earliest recurrence or PD.  I f a subject is still responding, 
then the subject's data will be censored at the date of the subject's last available disease 
assessment.  For subjects who never experience response, the subject's data will be 
censored on the date of enrollment.  Duration of response will be anal yzed by  
Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data for all enrolled subjects.  Median duration of 
response will be calculated and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be 
presented.
Time to progression (TTP) will be defined as the number of days from the date of 
firstdose or enrollment if not dosed to the date of earliest disease progression.  All disease
progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was 
taking the stud y drug or had previousl y discontinued the study drug.  If the subject does 
not experience disease progression, then the data will be censored at the da te of last 
available disease assessment.  Data for subjects who receive non -protocol, CLL therap y 
prior to disease progression will be censored at the last disease assessment prior to 
receiving non- protocol therap y.  Data for subjects without any disease a ssessments 
performed after the baseline visit will be censored at the time of enrollment plus 1 day.  
TTP will be analy zed by  Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data for all subjects enrolled.  
Median time TTP will be calculated and 95% confidence interval for median time TTP 
will be presented.
Progression -free survival (PFS) will be defined as the number of day s from the date of 
first dose to the date of earliest disease progression or death.  All disease progression will 
be included regardless whether the eve nt occurred while the subject was taking the stud y 
drug or had previously  discontinued the study  drug.  If the subject does not experience 
disease progression or death, then the data will be censored at the date of last disease

assessment.  Data for subjec ts who receive non -protocol CLL therapy  prior to disease 
progression will be censored at the last disease assessment prior to receiving non -protocol 
therap y.  Data for subjects without any disease assessments performed after the baseline 
visit will be censored at the time of enrollment plus 1 day.  PFS will be analyzed b y 
Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data for all subjects enrolled.  Median time PFS will be 
calculated and 95% confidence interval for median time PFS will be presented.
Overall survival (OS) will be defined as number of days from the date of first dose to the 
date of death for all dosed subjects.  For subjects who did not die, their data will be 
censored at the date of last study  visit or the last known date to be alive, whichever is 
later.  O S will be anal yzed by  Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data from all enrolled 
subjects.  Median time survival will be estimated and 95% confidence interval for the 
median time survival will be presented.
The CR rate (CR + CRi) in previously  treated BCRi subj ects will be assessed based on the 
2008 Modified I WCLL NCI -WG criteria.  The ninety -five percent (95%) confidence 
interval based on binomial distribution will be constructed for the calculated CR rate.
8.1.2.3 Exploratory  Efficacy  Endpoints
The rate of MRD negativ ity in subjects will be summarized.  This rate will be defined as 
the proportion of subjects who had MRD negativity  status.  Ninet y-five percent (95%) 
confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution will be provided.  In addition, the 
relationship between venetoclax PK and efficacy  parameters including MRD level and CR 
will be evaluated.
8.1.3 Timing of Efficacy  Endpoints and Safety  Evaluations
The date the last enrolled subjects has completed their Week 48 disease assessment, or 
after all enrolled subjec ts have discontinued venetoclax, whichever is earlier, will be 
defined as the data "cutoff" date for the efficacy analyses.  Efficacy and safety data up to 
and including this date will be collected.  Exact data cutoff date for the efficacy anal ysis 
will be detailed in a statistical analys is plan (SAP) which will be signed off prior to the

data cut -off date.  During this data collection period, active subjects will continue to 
receive venetoclax, as applicable.  When data collection is complete and all data 
management qualit y assurance (QA) and qualit y control (QC) procedures are performed, 
the clinical database data will be extracted for documentation and statistical anal yses.  
Any active subjects will continue to receive venetoclax until they  discontinue or for up to 
2 years.  Once the last enrolled subject discontinues/completes the study, the study will be 
considered complete and all remaining data will be collected and entered into the clinical 
database.
8.1.4 Additional Efficacy  Analyses
Health Economic and Pa tient Reported Outcome measures will include the FACT- Leu, 
the FACIT- F, and the EQ -5D-5L.
For the FACT -Leu, scores will be summarized descriptively at each assessment.  The 
impact of treatment on quality  of life over time will be assessed b y calculating th e change 
in scores from baseline at each assessment time point.  Scores will be calculated according 
to the FACT- Leu scoring manual.  
For the FACIT- F, scores will be summarized descriptively  at each assessment.  The 
impact of treatment on fatigue over time will be assessed b y calculating the change in 
score from baseline at each assessment time point.  Scores will be calculated according to 
the FACIT- F scoring manual.
Each of the five dimensions of the EQ -5D-5L, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and overall 
utility score will be calculated using the EuroQol scoring manual, and summarized (mean, 
std. dev., median) at each assessment.  The impact of treatment over time will be assessed 
by calculating the change in score from baseline to each assessment time point .
Alternative statistical analy ses may  be performed if deemed necessary  and helpful in 
understanding the drug effect.

8.1.5.4 Analyses of Laboratory  Data 
Where applicable, blood chemistry and hematology determinations will be categorized 
according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03 grades, and shifts from baseline NCI  CTCAE 
grades to maximum and final post -baseline grades will be assessed.
The baseline and final grades will be defined respectivel y as the grade of the last 
measurement collected prior to the first dose of study  drug, and as the last post -baseline 
measurement collected no more than 30 day s after the last dose of study  drug.  T he 
percentage of subjects experiencing a shift from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to maximum 
post-baseline grades of 3 to 4, and from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to final post -baseline 
grades of 3 to 4 will be summarized.  Detailed listings of data for subjects experiencing 
NCI CTCAE Grade 3 to 4 blood chemistry  and hematology  values will be provided.  All 
measurements collected, regardless of the number of day s after the last dose of study  
drug, will be included in these listings.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetics
Plasma concent rations of venetoclax will be tabulated for each subject.
An anal ysis of venetoclax plasma concentrations will be performed using a nonlinear 
mixed -effect population PK modeling approach.  The relationship between venetoclax PK 
and efficacy , including MRD level and CR, will also be evaluated.  The results from the 
population PK analy sis and evaluation of efficacy  may  not be reported within the clinical 
study  report.  Additional anal yses may  be performed if useful in the interpretation of the 
data.
8.2 Determina tion of Sample Size
Using the CR rate of 6% reported for current therapies45250 subjects would provi de 
approximately  90% power (based on an exact test for single proportions using a two -sided 
alpha of 5%) to reject the null hy pothesis of 6% in favor of an alternative hy pothesis that 
the CR rate for venetoclax monotherapy  is 12% (doubling of the CR rate).

In order to provide approximately  80% power (based on an exact test for single 
proportions using a two -sided alpha of 5%) to reject the null hypothesis of 6% CR rate in 
favor of an alternative h ypothesis that the CR rate for venetoclax monotherapy is 12% 
(doubling of the CR rate), the study  will enroll 190 subjects who have not been previousl y 
treated with BCRi therapy .  Since there are approximately  a total of 250 subjects, up to 
60subjects previously  treated with BCRi therapy  can be enrolled.

** Within 72 hours prior to scheduled visit starting with Week 8 Day 1.
*** As of Week 8 the visit window for scheduled visits is ± 2 days.
a. Subjects will undergo screening procedures within 28 days prior to the first study drug administration, except wher e otherwise indicated.
b. Subjects who have 17p deletion or TP53 mutation as assessed by local laboratory (in bone marrow or peripheral blood) may be c onsidered for enrollment.  A recent test is 
desirable but any previous positive test is acceptable.  Subj ects that do not have the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation or have an unknown status are also eligible.
c. For females of childbearing potential, as defined in the protocol, a urine pregnancy test must be obtained and processed loca lly at Week 1 Day 1, if it has been > 7 days since 
obtaining the serum pregnancy results at Screening.  During the study, a urine pregnancy test can be performed at the discret ion of the investigator or per local guidelines.
d. All protocol-related serious adverse events and nonserious adverse events must be collected from the signing of the study -specific informed consent until study drug 
administration.
e. A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening.  A symptom directed physical examination may be performed as needed.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Physical 
Examination, for more details.
f. For subjects who have a dose interruption lasting more than 1 week durin g the first 5 weeks of dose -titration or more than 2 weeks when at the daily dose of 400 mg, the TLS 
risk should be reassessed to determine if restarting at a reduced dose is necessary.
g. All clinical laboratory tests will be analyzed by the local laborat ory.  Required tests are listed in Table 4Clinical Laboratory Tests, refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures, 
sub header Hematology and Chemistry as well as Section 6.1.8 Toxicity Management, for more details. 
h. For all subjects, if the screening labs were done more than 72 hours before the planned first dose, the chemistry/hematology panel should be repeate d and results reviewed 
prior to the initial dose in order to make a treatment decision.  Labs should be assessed and pre -existing abnormalities should be corrected. 
i. For all subjects, on the day of Week 1 Day 1, before dosing, the chemistry/hematology p anel should be collected.  The results of the labs drawn on Week 1 Day 1 need to be 
reviewed prior to dosing IFan additional lab within 72 hours of the initial dose at Week 1 Day 1 was not drawn AND reviewed.  
j. For all subjects, the chemistry/hematolog y panel should be monitored at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours after the first dose of venetoclax (20 mg) and after the first do se increase 
(50 mg).  The next venetoclax doses should not be administered until the 24 hour lab results have been evaluated.  Elec trolyte abnormalities should be corrected promptly.  
Note:  There is a ± 2 hour window around the 24 hour lab draw. 
k. For all subjects, within 72 hours of each subsequent dose increase, the chemistry/hematology panel should be repeated.  The r esults shou ld be reviewed prior to dose 
increasing.
l. Prior to dosing, on the day of each subsequent dose increase, the chemistry/hematology panel is required.  The results of the labs drawn on Day 1 of each dose increase need 
to be reviewed prior to dosing IFaddit ional labs within 72 hours of the dose increase were not drawn AND reviewed. 
m. For subjects who continue to be at risk of TLS, the same lab monitoring schedule of 6 to 8 hour and 24- hr post dose should be followed at the subsequent dose increases.  
Note:   There is a ± 2 hour window around the 24 hour lab draw.

n. All measurable disease must be documented at Screening by laboratory testing, physical examination and CT scans (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated); bone marrow 
examinations are not requi red at screening but results will be recorded if available.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possi ble to the beginning of 
treatment.  For all subsequent disease assessments, disease response will be assessed by the investigator b ased on the analysis of clinical laboratory tests (hematology) and a 
complete physical examination at Week 24, Week 36 and Week 48.
o. CT scans with contrast (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated) should include neck, chest, abdomen and pelvic sequenc es can be accepted if previously performed within 
35 days prior to the initial venetoclax dose.  Otherwise, CT scans (or MRI) must be performed within the 28 day screening per iod.  To confirm response, a CT scan (or MRI) 
must be performed at Week 48 for all subjects.  CT scans (or MRI) may be performed 7 days prior to the scheduled Week 48 visit.  If a subject exhibits clinical signs of 
possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examinati on) without an increase in lymphocytes meeting the 
progression of disease criteria, then additional assessments including contrast -enhanced CT scan and/or bone marrow can be performed to confirm or rule out disease 
progression.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Computed Tomography Scans and Disease Assessments, for more details.  For patients with only Partial Remission at Week 48, an
additional CT and a bon e marrow examination can be done between Week 48 and Week 108 to confirm CR if there is a possibility that a patient is in Co mplete Remission 
based on laboratory tests and a disease assessment physical exam.
p. For determination of complete remission (CR), the CT scan and bone marrow are required to be negative, per the IWCLL NCI -WG guidelines.  If the subject achieves a CR 
by clinical criteria and confirmatory CT scan, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed to confirm the CR.  Whenev er possibl e the bone marrow aspirate for 
biomarker MRD assessment should be split from this sample.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Disease Assessments and Bone Ma rrow Aspirate and Biopsy, for more details.
q. MRD will be assessed by using peripheral blood at Week 1 Day 1 (baseline), Week 24 and Week 48.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 and Section 5.3.1.2 for more details.  When 
confirming a complete remission (CR + CRi) status per 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI -WG criteria with a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate.  The aspirate should be split and a 
sample sent to the central laboratory for MRD analysis. 
r. Venetoclax tablets should be taken orally once daily with a meal and water in the morning at approximately the sa me time each day.  Dosing may occur at study visits on 
Week 1 Days 1 & 2 through Week 5 Days 1 & 2.
s. The Quality of Life Questionnaires should be administered and completed prior to any other study procedures being performed a t these visits.  Refer to Se ction 5.3.7 , Health

Appendix H. Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte 
Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)
Section 1:  First Dose of Venetoclax or Dose Escalation
●Within the first 24 hours after either the first dose or dose escalation, if an y 
laboratory  criteria below are met, the subject should be hospitalized for 
monitoring and the investigator notified. No additional venetoclax doses 
should be administered unt il resolution.  Rapidly  rising serum potassium is a 
medical emergency .
●Nephrology  (or other acute dialy sis service) should be contacted/consulted (per 
institutional standards to ensure emergency  dialysis is available) on admission 
for an y subject hospitalized proph ylactically  or in response t o laboratory  
changes.
●IV fluids (e.g., D5 1/2 normal saline) should be initiated at a rate of at least
1mL/kg/hr rounded to the nearest 10 mL (target 150 to 200 mL /hr; not 
<50mL/hr). Modification of fluid rate should also be considered for 
individuals with specific medical needs.
●Monitor for sy mptoms or signs of TLS (e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, hypotension, muscle aches, weakness, 
paresthesias, mental status changes, confusion and seizures). If any clinical 
features are observed, rec heck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine within 1 hour STAT.
●Vital signs should be taken at time of all blood draws or an y intervention.
●The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial 
responses required. If a diagnosis of TLS is established, ongoing intensive 
monitoring and multi -disciplinary  management will be per institutional 
protocols.
In addition to the recommendations in the table below, for subjects receiving the first dose 
of vene toclax.

●For potassium increase ≥ 0.5 mmol/L  from baseline, or an y value 
>5.0mmol/L , recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine within 1 hour STAT and follow first guideline.
●For phosphorus increase of > 0.5 mg/dL  AND > 4.5 mg/dL, ad minister 
phosphate binder and recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine within 1 hour STAT.
Abnormality Management Recommendations
Hyperkalemia (Including Rapidly Rising Potassium)
Potassium ≥ 0.5 mmol/L increase from 
prior value (even if potassium within 
normal limits [WNL]) Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine in 
1 hour STAT.  If further ≥ 0.2 mmol/L increase in potassium, but 
still < upper limit of normal (ULN), manage as per potassium 
≥ULN.  Otherwi se recheck in 1 hour.
 Resume per protocol testing if change in potassium is < 0.2 mmol/L, 
and potassium < ULN, and no other evidence of tumor lysis.
 At the discretion of the investigator, may recheck prior to 
hospitalization.  If stable or decreased, and s till WNL, 
hospitalization is at the discretion of the investigator.  Potassium, 
phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine must be rechecked 
within 24 hours.
Potassium > upper limit of normal  Perform STAT ECG and commence telemetry.
 Nephrology (or othe r acute dialysis service) notification with 
consideration of initiating dialysis.
 Administer Kayexalate 60 g (or Resonium A 60 g).
 Administer furosemide 20 mg IV × 1.
 Administer calcium gluconate 100 to 200 mg/kg IV slowly if there 
is ECG/telemetry evidenc e of life -threatening arrhythmias.
 Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine in 
1 hour STAT.
o If potassium < ULN 1 hour later, repeat potassium, phosphorus, 
uric acid, calcium and creatinine 1, 2 and 4 hrs., if no other 
evidence of tumor lysis.

Section 2:  Ongoing Dosing of Venetoclax
Management of electrol yte changes from last value at intervals > 24 hours after either the 
first dose or dose escalation (e.g., 48 or 72 hours) are as below.
Note:  If the subject is hospitalized, no additional venetoclax doses should be 
administered until resolution.
●For potassium, admit subject for an y increase ≥ 1.0 mmol/L  (1.0 mEq/L), or 
any level > upper limi t of normal.
○Refer to the management guidelines for electrol yte changes observed 
within the first 24 hours after either the first dose or dose escalation (see 
prior table).
●If a smaller potassium increase is observed that does not meet the criteria for 
admission above, recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine in 24 hours and confirm no evidence of tumor ly sis prior to further 
venetoclax dosing.
●For uric acid, calcium, phosphorus and creatinine, refer to the management 
guidelines for electrol yte changes observed within the first 24 hours after

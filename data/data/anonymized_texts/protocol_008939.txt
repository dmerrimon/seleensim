 1  INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
1.1  Purpose  
The pur pose of this r andomized controlled trial  is to assess and compare the effect 
of peri -operative administration of Methylnaltrexone (MNTX) versus placebo on 
post-operative ileus (POI) following lumbar spinal fusion procedures.  
 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1  Background  
 
POI refers to the transient interruption of propulsive motor activity of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract that prevents effective movement of its contents and 
tolerance of oral intake. Although POI is generally considered to s ignificantly 
increase hospital stays and inpatient costs after spinal surgery, the incidence, associated risk factors, and effective preventative strategies remain poorly characterized.  
 POI was recognized as a complication of abdominal and other major surgeries as early as the late 1800s. The proposed etiologies underlying POI are broad and remain incompletely characterized. They include postsurgical sympathetic nervous 
system activation, inflammatory factors, and the effects of analgesics on GI tract 
motility [1, 2] .
  Treatment often consists of aggressive bowel regimens, nasogastric 
tube insertion for decompression, and the application of various laxativ es, 
suppositories, and enemas. The widespread use of these measures is unfortunately not supported by high level evidence.  
 
The incidence of POI after spinal fusion is reported to range between 0.6 to 16.7% [3]. This estimated range likely represents a gross underestimate of POI given the 
retrospective nature of studies undertaken to date. Fineberg and colleagues 
reported that the risk increases nearly 3- fold following anterior lumbar spinal 
fusions as compared to posterior surgeries [4]. Furthermore, the only risk factors they identified to be correlated with POI is male gender, ≥ 3 fusion levels, alcohol 
abuse, anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and weight loss. Kiely and colleagues [3]  
found that ileus was associated with the administration of certain intravenous 
solutions such as lactated ringers and sodium chloride. Interestingly, they found that albumin administration was associated with a reduced incidence of ileus postoperatively. Lee and colleagues evaluated POI following orthopedic surgery 
and reported an incidence of 2.1% [5] . They found that patients who developed 
POI were more likely to be older, had higher blood loss during surgery, and also

 had higher rates of preoperative constipation. This study, however, included all 
types of orthopedic surgeries (not limited to spinal fusion).  
 
2.2  Drug  Background 
 
Early clinical studies evaluated the effectiveness of MNTX in treating opioid-
induced constipation (OIC). Several clinical trials confirmed that MNTX was well 
tolerated and counteracted the GI effects of opioids, thereby enhancing gut motility 
without inhibiting their analgesic properties [8-10]. Only two studies to date have 
evaluated the potential effectiveness of MNTX in reducing the incidence of POI 
following GI surgery [11, 12]. Both studies were unfortunately hampered by serious design flaws. Most importantly, neither study included pre- operative admi nistration 
of MNTX, which was a characteristic of the alvimopan studies that showed clinical 
benefit [13-15]. As such, MNTX remains at this time approved only for chronic OIC 
based on two doubl e-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trials conducted in 
patients with advanced illness wherein MNTX rapidly induced laxation as compared to placebo [16, 17] . 
 
In 2001, alvimopan, a related perip herally acting µ -opioid receptor ( PAM -OR) 
antagonist that selectively targets GI µ- opioid receptors, was noted to significantly 
reduce the time to first flatus passage, time to first bowel movement ( BM), and time 
to discharge in a cohort of 78 patients undergoing either partial colectomy or total 
hysterectomy [18]. Wolff and colleagues found similar results in a larger cohort of 
469 patients  undergoing bowel resection or hysterectomy [19] . These results led 
to approval by the FDA in 2008 of alvimopan as the first (and still only) drug for 
POI treatment after partial small or large bowel surgery. Unfortunately, however, 
alvimopan is contraindicated in patients that have taken opioids the week prior to 
surgery, which significantly limits its application to spinal surgery patients who are often taking opioid analgesics at relatively large doses.  
 As such, there is a glaring paucity of clinical evidence regarding the potential 
benefits of PAM -OR antagonists for POI prophylaxis. Specifically, no studies have 
been undertaken to date evaluating MNTX in relation to POI prophylaxis after 
spinal fusion. A critical clinical need therefore needs to be addressed for spinal 
surgery patients who suffer from POI and its associated complications and costs.  
 
3  TRIAL DESIGN  
 3.1  Design  
 
IRB Approval Date: 11/20/2020  
Version Date: 11/16/2020  
Page 6 of 12 
 This randomized controlled trial  will prospectively evaluate the clinical benefit for 
subcutaneous MNTX in counteracting the obstipatory  effects of spinal surgery 
without increasing narcotic usage or otherwise disrupting the recover course of 
patients. Using a double -blind randomized design, either subcutaneous MNTX 
(0.15 mg/kg rounded to 8 mg or 12 mg)  or placebo will be administered star ting 
before surgery and then daily for three days.  
3.2 Primary  / Secondary Outcomes  
 
The primary outcome  will be the time from the end of surgery to the first bowel 
movement (BM; in hours). A sample size of 43  randomly assigned patients per 
study group (86  subjects in total) was calculated to detect a treatment effect  of 
MNTX (90% power; alpha = 0.05). This calculation was performed with the assumption that subjects who experience their first BM by day three comprise 50% 
in the placebo group and 85% in the treatment group. A  10% lost -to-follow up rate 
was also included in the calculation. The secondary outcomes will be the time to  
discharge and the time to discharge eligibility (in hours). Finally, exploratory  
outcomes  will include the amount of  daily narcot ics (in morphine milli- equivalents) 
administered during the first 4 days or up to hospital discharge. Administration of 
drug/placebo will be stopped should the patient experience frequent stools, defined 
as greater than 3 BMs per day.  
 
3.3  Inclusion Crite ria 
 
Subjects will be considered for inclusion  in this trial if they  satisfy the following 
criteria:  
1. Subject is scheduled to undergo a 1 –  3 level lumbar spinal fusion for 
degenerative spinal conditions including neurogenic claudication and/or lumbar radiculopathy with stenosis and/or spondylolisthesis . 
2. Subject must be over the age of 18 years old.  
3. Subject has been unresponsive to conservative care for a minimum of 6 
months.  
4. The subject must in the investigator’s opinion, be psychosocially, mentally, 
and physically able to fully comply with this protocol and have the ability to 
understand and give written informed consent . 
 
3.4  Exclusion Criteria  
 Subjects will be excluded from this trial if they satisf y any of the following criteria:  
1. Previous treatmen t with MNTX

 4  STUDY PROCEDURE  
 
4.1  Screening Assessments 
4.1.1  Informed Consent  
Subjects will be provided with an informed consent and will be given ample 
opportunity to review the consent and ask questions. The signed informed consent will be obtained before any study specific procedures  are initiated that are not part 
of the investigator’s standard of care . A copy of the informed consent will be given 
to the subject. All subjects who meet all of the entry criteria will be considered for inclusion in this trial. Any s ubject meeting any of the exclusion criteria will be 
excluded from the trial.  
All subjects who have agreed to participate in this study, have signed the informed consent and who meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria will be considered enrolled 
and assigned a subject ID number. Once a Subject ID number has been issued, it 
cannot be reassigned or used for another subject.  
4.1.2  Medical History and Demographic Data   
Within 30 days prior to the surgery date, the following information will be collected:  
• Demographic data  
• Medical history, including a complete history of spinal disorder(s) (non-operative or operative treatments performed)  
• Physical examination (including height, weight)  
• Current pain medications and other drug therapies.  
IRB Approval Date: 11/20/2020  
Version Date: 11/16/2020  
Page 8 of 12 
 • Primary diagnosis and any associated assessments collected per standard 
of care  
 
4.2 Recruitment and Randomization 
 
All subjects will be randomized in the trial to receive either subcutaneous MNTX (0.15 mg/kg rounded to 8 mg or 12 mg)  or placebo to be administered starting 
before surgery and then daily for three days.  Subjects  and investigators alike  will 
be blinded to their group status for the duration of the study assessments and procedures ( 1 month post-operatively).  
 
A sample size of 43  randomly assigned patients per study group (8 6 subjects in 
total) was calculated to detect a treatment effect of MNTX (90% power; alpha = 
0.05). This calculation was performed with the assumption that subjects who experience their first BM by day three comprise 50% in the placebo group and 85% in the treatment group. A 10% lost -to-follow up rate was also included in the 
calculation.  
 Potential participants will be identified by the principal investigator (HFF), co-investigators, and study personnel through the review of medical records during 
outpatient clinic visits at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Spine Center. 
A partial waiver of HIPAA authorization has been requested for this purpose. Given historical surgical numbers, a sufficient number of patients who are candidates for 
lumba r fusion procedures and potentially eligible for study enrol lment are expected 
to be evaluated during the study period.  
 
4.3 Perioperative and Postoperative Management  
 
Enrolled patients will be given MNTX (0.15 mg/kg rounded to 8 mg or 12 mg) or 
placebo prior to surgery in the pre- operative holding area and every 24 hours for 
3 days following surgery (a total of 4 doses). This dosing matches the FDA 
approved dosing for t he use of MNTX in patients effected by opioid induced 
constipation.  
 Following surgery patients’ BMs will be closely monitored and the time to first BM will be recorded in hours.  Patients will receive routine post -operative orders 
including early mobilization with a physical therapist on the first post -operative 
morning, intravenous patient controlled anesthesia for 1- 2 days transitioned 
thereafter to an oral opioid regimen, as well as a bowel routine comprising Docusate Sodium, Senna Glycoside, Polyethylene Glycol 3350, and Bisacodyl

Page 9 of 12 
 suppositories (started on post -operative day 2, if needed). All patients are also 
routinely discharged on a tapering oral opioid regimen.  
 
Administration of drug/placebo will be stopped should the patient experience 
frequent  stools, defined as greater than 3 BMs per day.  If a treating physician 
choses to prescribe the off -label use of Methylnaltrexone for the management of 
post-operative ileus, the subject will be unenrolled from the study. Abdominal X-
rays and CT will be collected and analyzed only if performed as standard of care to evaluate the GI tract following surgery. Additional review of c oncomitant 
medications, patient -reported pain levels (NRS), and adverse/serious adverse 
events will be reviewed daily for up to 96 hours following surgery and at 30 days 
post-operatively.

4.7  Success Criteria  
4.7.1  Primary Measure of Effectiveness  
A subject will be considered a success if a BM  is achieved within 3 days of 
surgery . The primary outcome measure of effectiveness  will be determined by 
the comparative rate of patients achieving BM and evading POI in the MNTX 
group versus placebo.  
IRB Approval Date: 11/20/2020  
Version Date: 11/16/2020  
Page 10 of 12 
 4.7.2  Secondary Measure of Effectiveness 
Secondary measures of effectiveness will be determined by the comparative 
average time to discharge eligibility and/or discharge in hours for the MNTX group 
versus placebo.  
 
4.7.3  Tertiary Measure of Effectiveness  
 
Tertiary measures of effectiveness will include the effect of MNTX on the amount 
of daily narcotics administered (in milli -equivalents) during the first 4 post -
operative days or up to hospital discharge.  
 
4.8  Subject Withdrawal  
 It is recognized that the subject’s participation in this trial is entirely voluntary, and that she/he may refuse to participate and may withdraw from participation at any time without jeopardy to any future medical care.  It is also recognized that the investig ator, at his/her discretion, may withdraw a subject from this study based 
upon his/her professional judgment.  
 
Other Conditions for Withdrawal : 
 
Any subject who develops a severe concurrent medical illness during the trial 
should be withdrawn.  This type o f illness is defined as any illness that would hinder 
the subject’s ability to return for scheduled follow -up appointments.  Such a 
withdrawal will not be counted for the purposes of determining success or failure.  
 
 
5  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN   
Efficacy analyses will be based on a modified intent -to-treat population including 
all subjects randomly assigned and having received at least one dose of study 
drug. The distribution of the primary efficacy end point time of first BM will be estimated via the Kapl an-Meier product -limit method and compared between 
treatment groups using the log -rank test. Secondary efficacy end points will be 
evaluated at the alpha = 0.05 level of significance without adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
 This study will attempt to identify not just relevant demographic and clinical risk factors for POI following spinal fusion, but also will quantify peri -operative opioid 
use in this patient population in order to determine whether an increased use of opioi ds increases the risk of POI.

Finally, safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, vital signs, physical examination findings, ECG findings, and 
laboratory test results. Withdrawals owing to AEs will be evaluated a s a safety end 
point. Treatment -emergent AEs, potentially clinically important laboratory 
measurements, and premature study discontinuations will be compared between 
groups by use of the Fisher exact probability test.

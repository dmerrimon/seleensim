PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title A Multi Center, Randomized, Double -Masked, Active-Controlled, Comparative 
Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of MYL -1701P and Eylea® 
in Subjects with Diabetic Macular Edema  
Protocol 
Number  MYL -1701P -3001  
Background 
and Rationale  Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness  worldwide. The 
International Diabetes Federation estimates that 285 million people worldwide 
have diabetes mellitus and that approximate ly 7% of t hese ind ividuals are 
affected  by diabetic macular edema.  
EYLEA® (aflibercept ) injection, an anti- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 
(VEGF) agent, has been approved by the FDA and  EMA for  the treatment of 
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). E ylea is bei ng marketed by Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the US and Bayer AG in EU.  
Mylan Inc. and Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are dev eloping MYL -1701P , a 
proposed biosimilar to  Eylea, and this study w ill serve to demonstrate the 
clinical similarity of MYL -1701P and Eyle a with r egard to efficacy, safety , 
pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity in the treatment of patients with DME. 
Primary 
Objectives  The primary objective is to demonstrate the clinical equivalence of MYL -
1701P  and Eylea  over 8 weeks of treatment at doses and  regimen  recommended 
by the Eylea  US Prescribing Information , as assessed by change from baseline 
to week 8 in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).  
Primary 
endpoints  The primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean change from baseline in BCVA 
as assessed b y Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)  letters at 
week 8.  
Methodology 
and treatments This is a multi -center, randomized, double -masked, active -controlled, 
comparative clinical study to demonstrate that no clinically meaningful 
differences ex ist betw een MYL -1701P and US -licensed Eylea in subjects with 
DME treated up to 52 weeks.  
Three hundred and twenty- four (324) eligible adult subjects with type 1 or 2 
diabetes mellitus wi th central DME involvement and BCVA between 73 and 38  
letters based o n ETDRS letters (20/40 – 20/200 Snellen equivalent) in the study 
eye and central retinal thickness (CRT) ≥ 300 µm, as determined by spectral 
domain – optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT)  in the study eye , will be 
randomized 1:1 to intravitreal t reatment with MYL -1701P  or Eylea .  
 
 
 
 Randomization will be stratified based on 
Baseline BCVA, i.e., ETDRS letter scores 73 -55 vs. 54-38  and geographical 
region (US, EU, Japan and rest of the world) . 
At study week 8, th e primary endpoint  will be assesse d, and subjects will 
continue to receive the assigned treatment until Week 48. An end of study visit 
will be conducted at Week 52. Subjects  will receive intravitreal injections of 
MYL -1701P  or Eylea  throughout the 52-week tr eatment period, with planned 
doses at Stu dy Days 1, 29 (week 4), 57 (week 8), 85 (week 12), 113 (week 16), 
169 (week 24), 225 (week 32),  281 (week 40) and 337  (week 48). Additional 
doses may be administered at Week 20, Week 28, Week 36 and Week 44 based 
on the vis ual acuity, and /or SD-OC T as per the protocol specified criteria for 
administering additional 4 -weekly doses .  
It should be note d that in most subjects where Eylea was dosed every 4 -weeks 
Confidential Page 6 of 517

compared to every 8 weeks, no additional efficacy was observ ed. Hence, it is 
expected th at most of the subjects may not require additional 4 -weekly doses.  
All subjects will return to clinic every 4 weeks for assessment of visual acuity 
(BCVA based on ETDRS letters) and central retinal thickness (CRT by 
SD-OCT) to a ssess ef ficacy and to guide treatment. There will be additional 
visits during the study as specified in the study schedule for safety an d 
pharmacokinetic evaluation.  
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity w ill be assessed for all the subjects parti cipating in the study, 
through assessment of blood samples for anti-drug antibody  and neutralizing 
antibody throughout the study. Along with immunogenicity, free aflibercept 
concentration in the blood samples from a ll subjects will be determined to 
evaluate drug tolerance status. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sample s will be collected in patients identified for PK 
subpopulation (at least 32 in each study arm) . Subjects in the PK subpopulation 
will have to visit the sites for  2 additional visits for sampling ( visits V2 and 
V7A). 
Investigational 
Products  Test product: MYL -1701P (a proposed biosimilar to Eylea)  injection for 
intravitreal injection.

Sample size   
 
 
 A total of 324 subjects will be randomized at 1:1 
ratio to each arm  after allowing fo r approximately 10%  drop-outs .  
 
 
 
 
Statistical 
Methods  For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in BCVA at Week 8, the 
primary analysis will be based on a mixed model repeated measures analysis 
with ter ms for treatment, vis it, treatment by visit interaction, and region, 
together with baseline BCVA as a covariate.  
The within subject variance -covariance matrix will be assumed to be 
unstructured;  estimation will use restricted maximum likelihood, and the 
denomina tor degrees o f freedom will use the Kenward -Roger estimate. This 
model will provide an estimate, standard error, and 90% as well as 95% two-
sided CIs for the treatment difference at Week 8. If these CIs are fully 
contained within the interval ( -3, 3) then equivalence will have been 
demonstrated.  
The primary analysis will be performed on the Full Analysis Set and will 
include data from all visits regardless of whether the subject is still receiving 
study medication.  
Additionally,  sensitivity analysis of th e primary endpoint will be conducted,  in 
which BCVA values after discontinuing study medication will be excluded. 
Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint will also be produced based on the

2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Indication  
Mylan Inc., in collaboration with Momenta Pharmaceutica ls, Inc. is developing a proposed 
biosimilar version of Eylea® (aflibercept ). Eylea  was f irst approved in 2011 by US FDA  for 
treatment of wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration . 
Eylea (aflibercept)  is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor  indicated for the 
following treatment s in the US and EU: 
• Neovascular (Wet) Age -Related Macul ar Dege neration (AMD) 
• Macular Edema Followin g Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)  
• Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)  
Additionally, it is  indicated for Diabetic Retinopathy in Patients with DM E in the US and 
visual impairment due to my opic choroidal neovascularization in the E U. 
This study is being conducted by Mylan to demonstrate  the clinical similarity  of MYL -1701P 
(a proposed biosimilar to Eylea , also referred to as  M710 ) and Eylea with reg ard to efficacy, 
safety , pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity in the treatment of patients with DME . 
2.2 Background and Rationale 
Diabetic retinopathy is a common  cause of blindness worldwide. The International Diabetes 
Federation estimates that 285 million peo ple worldwide have diabetes mellitus and th at 7% of 
these individuals are affe cted by diabetic macular edem a (Whiting DR, 2011; Ding  J et al ., 
2012 ). 
Anti-VEGF drugs are effective at improving vision in people with DME . Eylea  (aflibercept)  
confers some advantage over ranibizumab and bevacizumab in people with DME, at one year 
in both visua l and anatomic terms . (Virgili G  et al.,  2017 ). 
MYL -1701P is being developed as a proposed biosimilar t o Eylea  (aflibercept). Eylea  is a 
recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 
extracellular domains fused to  the Fc  portion of human IgG1 formulated as an iso- osmotic 
solution for intravitreal administration.  Eylea  is being marketed by Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  in the US and Bayer AG in EU.  
Complete information of the investigational medicinal product for MYL-1701P-3001 is 
available  in the Single Reference Safety Document, which for this study is the MYL -1701P 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
Throughou t this study protocol, “ Eylea” refer s to US -licensed Eylea . 
2.2.1 Rationale for Study  
MYL -1701P is currently being developed by the sponsor (Mylan Inc.) in collaboration with 
Momenta Pharmaceuticals, that is being  formulated as a proposed biosimilar to Eylea  in 
accordance with European U nion (EU) and US Biosimilar guidelines.  (EMA 2014 , 
FDA  2015 ) 
This is a multi -center, rand omized,  double- masked, active -contro lled, comparative clinical 
study to demonstrate that no clinically meaningful differences exist between M YL-1701P and 
US-licensed Eylea in subjects with DME treated up to 52 weeks. 
It is part of the overall registration package to support the regulatory ap proval of MYL-1701P 
as a proposed biosimilar  to Eylea.   
Confidential Page 24 of 517
2.2.1.1 Rationale for Study Population- Diabetic Macular Edema  
The active pharmacol ogic agent, in Eylea (aflibercept) , is understood to act as a soluble 
decoy receptor that binds to VEGF -A and PlGF, and there by inhibits the binding and 
activation of their cognate receptors VEGFR -1 and VEGFR-2, which are expressed on the 
surface of endothelial cells. Activation through  VEGFR-1 and VEGFR- 2 is associated with 
neovascularization  and va scular permeability, while in hibition of activation by Eylea 
(aflibercept)  has been demonstrated to reduce both processes, with clinical benefit in the 
indicate d disorders. ( Eylea  US Package I nsert , 2017 ).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
2.2.1.2 Rationale for Subject Selection and Study Endpoints  
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
It is recognized that baseline visual acuity can be a factor  in tre atment response. In 
Dugel PU  et al., 2016, treatment response was analyzed by  c ategories of baseline BCVA for 
several anti -VEGF treatments, bu t with greatest focus on  trials of Lucentis. It was 
demonstrated that change in BCVA increased as baseline BCVA  decreased. Therefore, to 
reduce variability, randomization  will be stratified based on Baseline BCVA, i.e., ETDRS 
letter scores 73-55 vs. 54-38 an d geographical region (US, EU, Japan and rest of the world). 
(Dugel PU et al ., 2016 ) In addition, baseline BCVA is included as a covariate in the primary 
analysis.  
Confidential Page 25 of 517

Change from baseline in BCVA is a clinically relevant endpoint and being a continuous 
variable is adequately sensitive to detect any clinically meaningful differences between study 
treatments. Hence mean change in BCVA is considered as the primary endpoint for the 
current study. Central retinal thickness is being evaluated as a key secondary en dpoint. CRT 
assesses the pharmacodynamic aspects of aflibercept  and is supportive in detect ing 
differences between study treatments  (MYL -1701P and Eylea). 
2.3 Study Design 
This is a multi -center, randomized, double- masked, active-controlled, compar ative clinic al 
study between MYL-1701P and US- licensed Eylea in subjects with DME treated up to 52 
weeks.  
A total of 324  eligible adult subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with central DME 
involvement and BCVA between 73 and 38 letters based on ETD RS letters  (20/40 – 20/ 200 
Snellen equivalent) in the study eye with CRT > 300 µm, as determined by SD- OCT,  in the 
study eye will be randomized 1:1 to intravitreal treatment with MYL -1701P or Eylea .  
 
 
  
 
A
t study week 8, the primary endpoint will be assessed , and subject s will continue to receive 
the assigned treatment until Week 48. An end of study visit will be conducted at Week 52.  
Subjects will receive intravitreal injections of either MYL -1701P or Eylea throughout the 
52-week treatment period, with planned doses at Study Day 1, Day 29 (week 4), Day 57 
(week 8), Day  85 (week  12), Day  113 (week 16), Day  169 (week 24), Day  225 (week 32), 
Day 281 (week 40) and Day 337 (week 48).  
In addi tion to the nine planned doses, study drug may also be administered at Week  20, 
Week  28, Week  36 and Week  44 based on the current visual acuity, and or SD- OCT  at that 
visit and in accordance with the “c riteria for administering a dditional 4-weekly doses ” 
outlined in Section 5.1.2.  
B
oth US  Package I nsert  (USPI) and EU Summary of Product Characteristics ( SPC) for Eylea 
recommends intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 5 injectio ns followed 
by intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months), USPI also allows additional every 4-
week (monthly) dosing in some subjects based on the need. However, SPC does not make 
any such recommendations for 4 weekly dosing after 5 injections.  
The current study allows for additional optional doses afte r 5 initial monthly injections if 
deemed necessary  as per the prespecified criteria. Additional efficacy was not demonstrated 
in most subjects when Eylea was dosed every 4  weeks compared to every 8  weeks.  Hence, 
most of the subjects may not require additio nal 4-weekly doses. Whenever the Investigator 
decides to administer additional doses, they must satisfy the criteria outlined in Section 5.1.2 
and should also weigh the procedural risks related to intravitreal injection versus potential 
benefit. 
All subjects  will return to clinic every 4  weeks for assessment of visual acuity (BCVA based 
on ETDRS letters) and central retinal thickness (CRT b y SD- OCT) to assess efficacy and  to 
guide treatment. There will be additional visits during the study as specified in the study visit 
schedule for safety and pharmacokinetic evaluation.  
Randomization will be stratified by BCVA at baseline (ETDRS Letter Sc ores 73-55 vs 
54-38) and geographical region (US, EU, Japan and Rest of the World).  
Confidential Page 26 of 517

Immunogenicity will be evaluated  for all the subjects participati ng in the study, through 
assessment of blood samples collected prior to  study drug administra tion for anti- drug 
antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. Along with immunogenicity, free drug  concentration  
in the blood samples fro m all subjects will be determ ined to evaluate drug tolerance status. 
2.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Subpopulation  
At least 32 subjects in each study arm  will be included in the pharm acokinetic (PK) subset 
and PK  sampling will be done in these subject s as per the Study  Schedule ( Table 1 ). These 
subje cts will be enrolled from identified participating Investigator sites after voluntary 
consent for the same.  These subjects will be required to visit the study site for PK sampling 
for 2 additional visits V2 and V7A, scheduled 48 hours after the first dose and fifth dose of 
study drug administration respectively . 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.3 Reporting St rategy 
 
 
 Complete 
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity data through Week 52 wi ll be 
included in the 52- week CSR.  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
2.4 Potential Risks  
There are no clinical data available on MYL -1701P in humans or animals. Although 
MYL -1701P has not yet been used in a clinical setting, comparative physiochemical 
characterization and biological characterization conduc ted to date showed a high degree of 
similarity between MYL -1701P and Eylea. 
The adverse r eactions available for the reference product , Eylea, could be reasonably 
assumed to be associated with MY L-1701P, and therefore considered expected for the 
purposes of expedited reporting to regulatory authorities and investigators. The excipients in 
the formulation of MYL- 1701P are different from that of the E ylea formulation . Investigator 
should consider this difference between MYL-1701P and Eylea, while evaluating hi story of 
hypersensitivity to any of the excipients.  
Confidential Page 27 of 517

However, because MYL -1701P has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies, investigators 
should carefully monitor for all adverse events, including those not described as ass ociated 
with Eylea and should promptly document and report th e adverse events as per the protocol.  
2.4.1 Safety Profile of Eylea 
A complete overview of the undesirable effects of E ylea can be found in the Eylea SPC and 
Eylea USPI . (Eylea SPC , 2017  and Eylea US  Package Insert , 2017 ). 
The adverse events of particular concern include bu t are not limited to : 
• Endop hthalmitis and retinal detachm ent fol lowing intravitreal injections: In such an 
event subject,  should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of 
endophthalmitis or retinal detachment withou t delay and should be managed 
appropriately.  
• Increases in intraocular pressure after  intravitreal injection.  
• Potential risk of a rterial thromboembolic events following intr avitreal use of VEGF 
inhibitors; these events will be classified  according to Hicks et al, 2018  by an 
Independent Cardiovascul ar Adjudication Committee  
The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving E ylea were 
conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous floaters, intraocular pre ssure in creased, 
and vitreous detachment. 
As this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potentia l for immunogenicity with 
Eylea /MYL -1701P. Subjects should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of 
intraocular inflammation, e.g. pain, photophobia, or redness, which may be a clinical si gn 
attributable to hypersensitivity.  
For any potential aller gic reaction after administration of study drug, diagnosis and 
assessment of anaphylaxis will be done using National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Disease and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network ( NIAID/FAAN ) criteria of 
anaphylaxis; the manageme nt of anaphylaxis should follow the standard institutional 
practices ( Appendix 11.1 ). 
2.4.2 Intravitreal injections  
The drugs used to anesthetize the eye before injections can cause an allergic reaction,  
seizures and irregular cardiac rhythm.  
Subconjunctival hemorrhage or floaters may occur because of intra- vitrea l injection. Mild 
discomfort, ocular hyperemia, increased lacrimation, discharge or itching ma y occur which 
may last for few days.  
There may be an elevation of intraocular pressure imm ediately following the injection. It 
usually returns to normal spontane ously  but may need treatment with topical drugs or a 
paracentesis to lower the pressure.  
As a result of the injectio n, endophthalmitis can develop and it is treated by intravitreal 
injection of antibiotics, but there is a risk of permanent loss of vision  including blindness. 
Retinal detachment can also occur as a result of the injection. If this occurs, surgi cal 
interve ntion may be required. The injection could also cause a vitreous hemorrhage. This 
usually resolves spontaneously, although surgical intervention may be required.

2.4.3 Eye examination and Investigations 
There is a rare risk of an allergic response to the topical  medications used to anesthetize the 
eye or dilate the pupil. There  may be other adverse events related to the topical medications 
used, f or which respective prescribing information should be referred.  
There are no known risks associated with SD-OCT or fun dus photographs. The bright flashes 
used to take the photographs ma y be annoying  but are not painful and cause no damage.

4.3.3 Criteria for study drug termination, withdrawal from the study and study 
termination  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice  to 
their future medical care by the investigator or at the study center.  
Every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study. When available, a reason for not 
completing the study  will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
If, a subject discontinues from the study prematurely, due to any reason as provided in the below 
withdrawal criteria, the site should request the subject s’ consent for being follow ed-up during 
further study visits or at least until the Week 8 to perform safety and efficacy assessments as 
per the Study Schedule  (Table 1).  
A subject  may be required to terminate  study d rug for reasons including the following:  
• The subject withdraws consent.  
• For female subjects, diagnosis of pregnancy or stated intention to become pregnant. All 
efforts should be made by the site to obtain consent from the pregnant women, so that 
they are f ollowed until delivery or termination. 
Confidential Page 35 of 517
• At the investigator’s discretion ( it is recommended that the investigator discusses with 
medical monitor prior to decision) , if it is in the subject’s best interest due to 
occurrence of an AE and/or other find ings con sidered to present a safety concern to 
continued dosing with study drug, which include but not limited to: 
o Development of hypersensitivity reaction suspected to be attributable to study 
drug which may contraindicate the continued dosing with the study drug  
o Development of ocular or periocular in fection, active intr aocular inflammation 
which may contraindicate the continued dosing with the study drug 
• Despite education/reinforcement, the subject shows persistent inadequate compl iance 
with required stu dy visits/procedures, poten tially compromising s afety monitoring 
while on study drug based on investigator’s discretion. 
• The subject takes p rohibited treatment  presenting a safety concern to continued 
dosing with study drug 
• At the investigator’s discretion  (it is recommended that the investigator discusses with 
medical monitor prior to decision) , in certain situations such as disease flare, 
progression, or nonresponse that requires treatment with a prohibited medication o r 
procedure, which in the opinion of the inv estigator warrants treatment withdrawal.   
• If the mask is broken for a subject by the Investigator  
Subjects who prematurely terminate study will have an Early Termination (ET) visit 
scheduled as soon as possible.  
The Principal Investigator and/or Mylan re serves the right to terminate the study for any 
reason.  
The study will be terminated early if there are significant safety concerns.

• Hormonal contracept ives (oral *, injected, transdermal or implanted)  with the 
exception of low dose gestagens, i.e. only containing lynestrenol or norethisterone, 
since they do not inhibit ovulation and are therefore not considered as highly-
effective. The subject must remain  on the hormonal contraceptive throughout the 
study and must have been using hormonal contraceptives for an adequate period prior 
to the study to ensure effectiveness (e.g., 3 months)

5 STUDY DRUG  
5.1 Investigational Drug  
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administrat ion:  
MYL -1701P (a proposed biosimilar to Eylea ) injection for intravitreal injection is a sterile, 
clear, and colorless to pale yellow sol ution. It is supplied as a preservative -free, sterile, 
aqueous solution in a single -use, glass vial designed to deliv er 0.05 mL (50 µL) of proposed 
aflibercept (40 mg/mL )  
 
Reference T herapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Eylea is a sterile, clear,  and colorless to pale yellow solution. It is supplied as a 
preservative -free, sterile, aqueous solution in a single-use, glass vial designed to deliver 0.05 
mL (50 µL) of Eyl ea (40 mg/mL  in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 40 mM sodium chloride, 
0.03% polysorbate 20, and 5% sucrose). Eylea  will be sourced from the United States.  
5.1.1 Administration of Stu dy Drugs 
All subjects are planned to receive study drug as an intravitreal injection at a dose of 2  mg 
every 4 weeks for a total of 5 injections, and then every 8 weeks through the remainder of the 
52-week treatment period, with the last dose at 48 weeks.  
Subjects will receive intravitreal injections of MYL -1701P or Eylea throughout the 52-w eek 
treatmen t period, with planned doses at Study Day 1, Day 29 (week 4), Day 57 (week 8), 
Day 85 (week 12), Day  113 (week 16), Day  169 (week 24), Day  225 (week 32), Day  281 
(week 40) and Day  337 (week 48).  
In addition to the nine planned doses, study drug may also be administered at Week  20, 
Week  28, Week 36 and Week 44 based on the visual acuity, and/or SD- OCT at that  visit and 
in accordance with the “criteria for administering additional 4 -weekly doses” outlined in 
Section  5.1.2.  
5.1.2 C
riteria for administering additional 4 -weekly doses 
 
 
    
 
    
 
 
 
Additional efficacy has not been demonstrated in most subjects when Eylea was dosed every 
4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks. Hence, most of the subj ects m ay not require additional 
4-weekly doses.  
5.1.3 Delayed and Missed Visits and/or Dose 
Every attempt should be done to c omplete the v isits and/or dosing with in the given window 
period for each scheduled visi t. The out of window drug administration should be recorded as 
a protocol deviation. 
If dose is given late for unavoidable reasons, the next scheduled dose should occur no sooner 
than three weeks after th e previous dose. The next dose should be scheduled s uch that it is as 
Confidential Page 39 of 517

close as possible to the original scheduled date of visit and at least 3 weeks apart f rom the 
previous dose. Investigators should ensure that the subj ects’ general clinical and the ocula r 
conditions are suitable for dosing prior to every dosing. 
If the visit is delayed until the start o f the window period of the next dose, the visit will be 
considered as a missed visit . 
The reasons for the delayed or missed visits and/or doses must  be documented in the patient’s 
study records and appr opriate section of the eCRF and all efforts shoul d be taken to 
administer the subsequent scheduled doses on time.  
5.1.4 Administration Procedure  
MYL -1701P must only be administered by a qualified person and the dosing regimen is 
expected to be the same as the cu rrent labeling for Eylea . Intravitreal injections  should not be 
performed if the pre -dose intra- ocular pressure is more than 30 mm Hg.  (Eylea  EU SPC, 
2017 ) 
The intravitreal inje ction procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, 
which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of  steril e gloves, a sterile drape, and a 
sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent).  
Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad –spect rum microbicide should be given prior to the 
injection.  The choice of the anesthetic age nt and the mic robicide can follow institutional 
practices.  The details of the pre -medication administered should be documented. 
Immediately following the intravitreal i njection, subjects should be monitored for elevation in 
intraocular pressure. If required, a sterile  paracentesis needle should be availa ble. 
Additionally , vision will be assessed post -injection by hand movements or counting fingers. 
Following intravitreal  injection, subjects should be instr ucted to report any symptoms 
suggestive of intraocul ar inflammatio n, endophthalmitis and/or retinal d etachment (e.g., eye 
pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay. 
If the subject reports any of these symptoms, Investigator w ill perform OE and appropriate 
investigations to con firm the diagn osis. Additional immunogenicity sampl es will be collected 
if subject has signs of intraocular inflammation , suggesting immune reaction . 
Each vial should o nly be used for the treatment of a s ingle eye. After injection, any unused 
product must be discarded. 
In the event of any significant dos ing errors, the CRO Medical Monitor, or designee should 
be contacted immediately.  
5.2 Drug Inventory  
Mylan will supply MYL -1701P and US-reference  Eylea  to the study sites packaged and 
labeled per all local legal  requirements.  
Clinical Supplies will provide pre packaged supplies for each subject. A kit will be assign ed at 
randomization using the IXRS. 
A label will be attached to  the outside of each kit. The text wi ll be compliant with local 
regulatory requirements and may includ e some of the following information : 
• Protocol number 
• Subject number/study center number 
• Contents and quantity 
• Lot number 
Confidential Page 40 of 517
• Randomization code/kit number  
• Investigator name  
• Storage instructions  
• Caution statement (for clinical study use only)  
• Expiry date 
• Sponsor ’s name and address  
5.3 Study Medicat ion Complaints  
In the event of a complaint/concern during study participation, regarding the supplied study 
medication,  the site should contact the sponsor. Additional information and potentially the 
return of study medica tion may be requested by Mylan to investigate the complaint.  The 
details of the complaint handling will be provided in an appropriate study manual. 
5.4 Storage, Disposition of Unused Study Drug  and Drug Accountability  
The I nvestigator, or an app roved represent ative, e.g. , pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area under recommended storage conditions 
and in accordanc e with applicable regulatory require ments while at the investigator site.  
Study drug should be stored in accordance with the drug label. Storage conditions stated in 
the Investigator’s Brochure may be superseded by the label storage.  
Temperature of storage  facilities should be monitored and recorded daily  using validated 
devices that record m aximum and mini mum temperatures. Should the storage facility 
experience any excursion of temperature outside of the labelled storage condition this must 
be reported imm ediately to Mylan or designee.  At si tes where daily monitoring and recording 
is not poss ible at weekend s, then on the next working day af ter the weekend the temperature 
record (e.g. , max/min thermometers) should be checked immediately for any temperature 
excursions. Devices used for temperatu re monitoring should be regularly calibrated. Affec ted 
material mu st be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion has been assessed 
and confirmed by Mylan.  
The investigator must maintain adequate records  documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the study drug.  If Mylan or CRO suppl ies drug accountability forms , these 
must be used. Alternatively , Mylan may approve use of standard institution forms. In either 
case, the forms must identify  the study drug, including batch or code numbers, and account 
for its disposition on a subject-by- subje ct basis, including specific dates  and quantities. The 
forms must be signed by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided 
to Myla n or designee.  
At the end of the stu dy, Mylan will provide instructions as to dispositio n of any unused 
investigational product. If Mylan  authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulat ions, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Mylan.  Destruction 
must be adeq uately documented. 
5.5 Masking  
Considering the ophthalmology indication, the term “masking” has been used instead of 
“blinding” throughout the protocol. 
The study drug will be provided as glass vials and syringes.  
Masked pers onnel 
Confidential Page 41 of 517
Investigator will be masked throughout the study. Investigator /designee  will perform all study 
assessment s prior to and following study drug admini stration.  Investigator will also dec ide on 
the requirement of optional injections as nec essary.  
Unmask ed Personnel 
If an alternate ophth almologist is available at the site:  
An alternate ophthalmologist will be identified to be responsible for preparation  and 
administration of the study drug. Ophthalmologist administering the study drug will perform 
the po st injection procedures like measurement of IOP and any safety assessments up to 
30 minutes after the study drug administration. However, the ophthalmolo gist administering 
the study drug will not perform any other study assessments including safety and eff icacy 
assessments. If the unmasked ophthalmologist is not available at 30 minutes after dosing, the 
masked ophthalmologist may perform post- dose safety a ssessments.  
An unmasked site personnel, may be identified to be  responsible for the receipt, tracking, 
preparation and destruction of stu dy drug . 
If an alternate ophthalmologist is  not available at the site ; and  a qualified u nmasked 
Pharmacist or Physician Assistant  is available at site : 
Incases, where the site does not have an alternate ophthalmologist, a qualified unmasked 
study personnel, i.e., unmasked pharmacist, physician assistant, will be identified to be  
responsible for the receipt, tracking, prepa ration and destruction of study drug. The identified 
qualified pharmacist/physician assi stant will prep are the drug and hand over the syringe to 
the masked Investigator for intravitreal  administration. Every effort should be taken to avoid 
any accidental u nmasking of masked study personnel du ring the process. The detailed 
instructions will be  given in a separate masking and unmasking plan.  
Every effort will be made to ensure that all other study site personnel other than those 
designated as unmasked, remain masked to treatment assignment.  
Masked and unmasked roles will be assumed for the enti re study  and, s witching from an 
unmasked to a ma sked role after the first subject is randomized at a site is not permitted. Any 
deviation to the roles above must be ap proved by the sponsor, and properly documented 
before any subjects are treated. The Site  Signature and Delegation Log are required to be 
maintained as new personnel are added to the study team. 
The central SD-OCT assessment, and central laboratory assessme nt, including safety, PK and 
immunogenicity, will be performed by the masked personnel. The complete det ails of the 
study personnel with their masking status will be maintained in the Mask ing and Unmask ing 
plan. 
The responsibilities of the Masked personnel are as follows:  
• Perform all screeni ng procedures up until randomization  
• Assess inclusio n/exclusion crit eria 
• Obtain medical , surgical , ophthalmic and smoking history  
• Obtain informed consent 
• Collect and process samples for laboratory testing  
• Acquire SD - OCT, fundus photography (FP), and fluorescein angiography (FA) 
images and transfer th em to reading centers  
• Acquire ECGs  
• Perform study  drug administration (when preparation of study drug is done by an 
identified unmasked pharmacist, physician assistant at the site)  
Confidential Page 42 of 517
• Perform post- treatment safety assessments  (except for post injection proced ures like 
measurement  of IOP and any safety asses sments up to 30 minutes after the study drug 
administration) . 
• Decide on need for additional treatment, if any 
• Assess AE s, including severity and relationship 
• Perform complete OE  at all study visits  
• Evaluate all safety, including  review of images for safety  concerns at the site  
• Evaluate vital signs and ECGs; perform physical examinations  
• Test refraction and BCVA  
• Check IOP  
• Assess  SD - OCT, FP /FA. 
Responsibilit ies of the Unmasked Personnel are as follows:  
• Receipt, tracking, and destruction of study drug  
• Prepare study drug 
• Study drug administration and post injection procedures like measurement of IOP and 
any safety assessmen ts up to 30 minutes after the study drug administration  (when 
unmasked ophthalmologist i s identified at the s ite) 
Note: For patients in C zech Republic, additionally, the masked or unmasked ophthalmologist 
can monitor the patient for clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of adverse events  for at 
least 60 minutes after the study drug administ ration.  
5.6 Randomization  
Assignment of Subject  Identification number (SID), randomization number and study 
medication, as well as site drug inventory control will be  managed by an automated IX RS. A 
manua l containing complete instructions for Web or telephon e access and use will be 
provided to each sit e prior to study start. At their first clinic visit, the IXRS will assign a SID.  
Each SID will be unique and serve as t he primary subject identifier througho ut all phases of 
the study. The SID must appear on all CRF pages, source docu ments, laboratory data , ECG 
and diary data. Subjects qualifying to enter the study drug treatment phase, will be ass igned 
an additional “randomization number” by the IXRS at rando mization. 
For those patients added to the study as per section 7.1 , randomizatio n will be according to 
the original randomization schedule, i.e the next one available will be enrolled , and NOT 
replace the old patients’ treatm ent. 
5.7 Breaking the Mask  
Regardless of the assigned treat ment arm, all subjects in the study are pro vided with active 
treatment, MYL -1701P or Eylea . 
The masked treatment  code must not be broken, except in emergency situations for which the 
identification of the study treatment of a subject is required by the Investigator in case of a 
medical emergency and when the  knowledge of the study treatment allocation is required for 
appropriate management of the medical event . Investigator should access the ‘Emergency 
Code break’ module in the IXRS system for breaking the m ask. The details of the procedure 
for “Emer gency Code break via Web ” are provided in the IXRS User Manual. In such 
situations, the randomization information will b e held by designated individual(s), and the 
date and reason for breaking the mask  must be reco rded. The investigator should follow the 
study ’s rand omization procedures and should ensure that the code is broken only in 
accordance with the protocol. As the study is mask ed, the investigator should promptly 
document and explain to the sponsor any premature un mask ing (e.g., accidental un mask ing, 
Confidential Page 43 of 517
unmask ing due to a serious adverse event) of the investigation al product(s). Unmasking of 
treatment code for final da ta analysis will be done after database loc k. Unmasking process 
will be performed in accordance to both Sponsor’s and CRO’s unmasking SOPs, as detai led 
in the sta tistical analysis plan.  
In the event th at the mask  is broken for a subject by the Investigator , this subject is to be 
withdrawn from the study.  
5.8 Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to pos t-
study follow-up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, frequency, and start and stop 
dates of administration in the CRF. All su bjects will be questioned about concomitant 
medication at each clinic visit and at follow up.  
Medications taken within 90 days prior to screening and prior to dos ing with study 
medication will be documented as a p rior medication. Any other important medica tions 
relevant to the treatment condition or the study treatment (e.g., prior treatment for DME) 
taken before the 90 da ys are also recommended to be recorded.  
Medications taken after dosing with study medication w ill be documented as concomitant 
medication s. 
Prohibited Medications  
Subjects will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in Table 2. Use of 
prohibited medication after randomization and during the st udy will be deemed a protocol 
deviation and such subjects will be assessed by Mylan or designee regarding potential nee d to 
early terminate st udy dr ug (e.g. for safety reasons - see Section  4.3.3 ). 
Table 2: List  of P rohibited Treatment  
• Use of intraocular or periocular corticosteroids or other DME therapy in study eye  
• Antiangiogenic drugs for study eye (e.g., pegaptanib, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, 
aflibercept ) 
• Systemic antian giogenic drugs (e.g., bevacizumab, aflibercept)  
• Drugs that optimize (retinal) microcirculation e.g ., calcium dobesilate  
• Pan-retinal or macular laser photocoagulation  in the study eye for the treatment of DME  
• Systemic medications known to be toxic to the l ens, retina or optic nerve, including 
deferoxamine, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, tamoxifen, phenothiazines and 
ethambutol 
• Concurrent treatment with an investigational drug or de vice in the either eye  
• Any other medication/treatment which c an impact the v isual acuity or safety while on 
concurre nt treatment with aflibercept based on Investigator’s discretion . 
Permitted Medication  
Any medication other than the identified prohibited medications that were considered 
necessary for the subject’ s best interest and not expected to interfere with the safety or 
efficacy of the study drug can be given at the discretion of the Investigator. Investi gator is 
recommended to consult the Medical Mo nitor if he/she is u nclear on the impact of a 
concomitant medic ation on the  study endpoints. 
5.8.1 Study Eye  
Subjects w ill not be allowed to receive any medications (approved or investigational) for 
their DME in the study eye other than the study treatment (MYL-1701P or Eylea ), as 
Confidential Page 44 of 517
specified in the protocol, until they had completed the end of study (week 52) or early 
termi nation visit assessments. The prohibited medications should neither be admini stered 
locally (e .g., IVT, topical, juxtascleral, or periorbital routes), nor systemi cally, with the intent 
of treating the study eye. 
5.8.2 Fello w / Non -study Eye  
If the fellow eye ha d DME involving or threatening the center of the macula, requiring 
treatment, standard of care therapy can be administered, if necessary. All fellow eye 
treatment s must be recorded on the eCRF as a con comi tant medicat ion and/or procedure for 
the fellow eye . The fellow eye will not be considered an additional study eye. Subjects who 
receive  treatment for the fellow eye will  not be withdrawn from the study. Safety of the 
fellow eye should be monitored, an d all AEs collec ted. Other conditions in the fellow eye 
could be treated with approved therapies. 
Immunogenicity and safety of subjects who received intravitreal anti- VEGF therapy in the 
fellow eye will be analyzed se parately and the analysis will be detai led in the statistical 
analysis plan. 
5.8.3 Management of Dia betes  
The subject will receive treatment for diabetes as per standard of care , per institutional 
practice and as prescribed by the treating ph ysician . 
 
Confidential Page 45 of 517
6 STUDY CONDUCT  
Subject s eligible for study recruit ment  will have t he nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
explained to them by the investigator. They will be provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and give n sufficient time to  consider the study’s 
implications befo re deciding to p articipate.  A separate PK consent form will be provided to 
the subjects willing to participate in the PK subpopulation at the participati ng sites. Subjects 
agreeing to participate i n the study will sig n the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before 
undergoing any screening or pre- screening (if r equired) procedures. For every subject 
screened , a unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by contacting the IXRS system.   
Once a subject enrolls  in this study, the site will make every effort  to retain the s ubject for the 
planned duration of the study . Clinical study site staff are responsible for developing and 
implementing support and retention plans. Elements of this plan may include the followin g. 
• Thorough explanation of the complete clini cal study visits  schedule and procedural 
requirements d uring the informed consent process and re- emphasis at each clinic visit  
• A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are crit ical for the study 's 
successful analysis, and the importanc e of all the tre atment groups to the overall success 
of the study 
• Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to cli nic visit 
attendance and full study participation  and compliance 
• Collection of contact information at screen ing (address, phone numbers, email), which is 
regularly  reviewed at subsequent clinic visits  
• Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders  
• Immediate and multifaceted follow -up on missed clini c visits, including the possible use 
of trained staff to co mple te in-person  contact with subjects at their homes  
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reach ed to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the 
subject so that the y can appropriat ely be withdrawn from the study. All co ntact attempts 
should be documented in the subject's medical record. Should the subject continue to be 
unreachable, then and only then will he /she be considered t o have withdrawn from the study 
with a prim ary reason of "Lost to Follow- up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless  of 
site plans to suppor t and retain subject s within the study, subjects may volunt arily withdraw 
from the study  for any reason and at any time.  
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures , it is anticipated that the duration of 
study would be up to 13 months (56 we eks).  
6.1 Screening Procedures  
Each prospective subject must a gree to particip ate in screening procedures by signing the 
most recent ICF before any screening procedure is initiated.  Each subject will be assigned a 
SID via IXRS. The Principal Investigator or S ub-Investigator will  review the inclusion and 
exclusion cri teria to confirm  eligibility of each subject prior to e nrolment. 
6.1.1 Screening Visit  [Day -28 to Day -1] 
Subject s will commence screening procedures within 28 days prior to randomization, to 
confirm th at they meet the sel ection criteria for the study.  If the time between scre ening 
procedures and potential randomiz ation exceeds 28 days as a result of unexpected delays, 
then the subject ’s status  will need to be discussed with Mylan or designee to consider 
potential for re -screening (if re screening is agreed, the  subject will ne ed to be re-consented 
Confidential Page 46 of 517
and assigned a ne w SID via IXRS). Re -screening for other reasons may be possible following 
discussion with the CRO Medical Monitor . If re -screening occurs this  will be clearly 
documented within the site file.

Subject s may r equest termination of study drug or withdrawal from the study at any time, or 
be required to withdraw or terminate study drug by the investigat or or sponsor for reas ons a s 
per Section  4.3.3 . If study drug i s terminated or the subject withdraws or is withdrawn, the 
reason for termination/withdrawal should be established and r ecorded. If a subject does n ot 
return for a scheduled v isit, every effort should be made to contact the subject . In any 
circumstance, ev ery effort should be made to document the outcome of sub ject contact  
attempt , if possible.  The investigator will contact  Mylan or designee in the ev ent that a 
subject fails to  complete the study or violates the protocol.  
If the subject  withdraws from the s tudy and withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no addi tional data should be 
collec ted. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.  
Unless  consent is withdrawn, subject s who prematurely terminat e study drug will be asked to 
return to the clinic for an ET vis it and will have this scheduled as soon as possible aft er their 
last dose of study drug.  
The following Procedures will be completed:

6.3 Treatment Procedures  
Every effort should be made to ensure th at the protocol required tes ts and procedures are 
completed as described . However , it is anticipated that from time to time there may be  
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible  to 
perform the test.  In these cases,  the investigator or desi gnated representative will take all 
steps necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of the subject. When  a protocol required 
test cannot be performed the invest igator or designated representative will document the 
reason for  this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure 
that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The monitor or designee from the 
CRO  study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.  
Activities s pecific to this protocol are  expanded upon further below. 
6.3.1 Efficacy Assessments  
The refractionist and visual acuity examiner, the examine r for the primary outcome 
measurement, for each subject will be masked to the treatment assignment and study eye. 
The su bject and ophthalmologist (e valuating Physician ) will be masked to wheth er the 
subject is receiving MYL -1701P or Eylea . 
6.3.1.1  Ophthalmologic E xamin ation 
A study ophthalmologist (evaluating Physician ) will perform  a dilated eye examination of 
each eye of the  subj ect to establish that the ocular inclusion criteria are met and that non e of 
the ocular exclusionary conditions are present.  
Only one e ye wi ll be classified as study eye. Study eye will be de cided based on BCVA, CRT 
and other eligibility assessments at th e discretion of the masked  investigator. If both eyes are 
eligible, the study eye will be selected by the principal investigator (masked). Once the study 
eye has been determined , it should rem ain the study eye throughout. If the fellow eye 
develops DME or if the condition of DME in the fellow eye worsens during the study, the 
fellow eye must not be considered as the study eye.  
The compl ete O E will include: 
Prior to Study Drug Administration  
Intraocular pressure:  
Intraocular pressure of the study eye will b e measured using standard devices (e.g., 
Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tono-pen™) . The same method of IOP measurement 
will be used  in each subject throughout the study. 
Indirect Ophthalmoscopy: 
Subjects' posterior pole and peripheral retina will be  examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy. 
Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy: 
Confidential Page 53 of 517
Subjects' ant erior eye structure and ocular adnexa will be  examined using a slit lamp.  
After Study drug administration: 
Finger Coun ting 
Vision will be assessed post -injection by hand movements or c ounting fingers.  
Intraocul ar pressure:  
Intraocular pressure of the study eye will be measured using standard devices ( e.g., 
Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tono-pen™). The same method of IOP measurement 
will be used in each subject throughout the study. Intraocular pressure is me asured at 
approximately 30 minutes post-dose. 
For Czech Republic, additionally, patient will be monitored by  the masked or unmasked 
ophthalmologist for clinical sig ns and symptoms suggestive of adverse events for at least 60 
minutes after the study drug administration.  
6.3.1.2  BCVA  
Visual acuity of the study  eye and fellow eye will be evaluated using the ETDRS protoco l at 
4 meters (further detailed in a separate visual acu ity testing protocol). 
Refraction and testing of visual acuity to fulfill study eligibility  criteria must be performed 
before the subject ’s eyes are dilated and before fundus photography and SD-OCT i f these 
procedures are to be carried out on the same day. Refraction must precede visual acuit y 
testing. A certified Visual Acuity Examiner must perform the standardized, ETDRS  visual 
acuity testi ng. The visual acuity examiner will be masked to the treatme nt assignment. All 
efforts should be made for the visual acuity examiner to have no knowledge of the study eye  
and have no ready access to the subje ct’s previous BCVA recorded. 
It is recommended that same Visual Acuity Examiner perform s VA throughout the study, 
specifically at baseline and Visit 5 (Week 8). 
A detailed protocol for conducting the VA testing and refraction wil l be provided as part of 
study procedure manual. 
6.3.1.3  SD-OCT/CRT  
Central retinal  thickness and other retinal characteristics will be evalu ated at scheduled visits 
using SD-OCT. The CRT will be m easured as central subfield thickness . 
An OCT of the study eye and fellow eye will be performed by a certified OCT Technician 
according to the standardized procedures described in separate  manual pr epare d for this 
study. OCT images for the study eye will be transmitted to an independent image readi ng 
center. All OCT im ages will be archived electronically at the study sites as part of the source 
documentation. OCT technicians will be certified to maintain quality and consistency. OCT 
technicians will be ma sked to the study drug assignment. 
At screening, for subject eligibility assessment, CRT will be assessed by central reading of 
SD-OCT images.  
At randomization, for assessment of continued eligibi lity of the subject, CRT reading by the 
Investigator performed at the site will be used.  
Similarly, for assessment of req uirement of additional 4- weekly doses as described in 
Section  5.1.2, the CRT read ing by the Investigator performed at the site will b e use d. 
However, for efficacy analysis the central CRT reading of SD- OCT at all visits will be 
considered. 
Confidential Page 54 of 517
 
Because the e ye must be dilated for OCT, it must be performed after testing visual acuity if 
these procedures are carried out on the same day.  
6.3.1.4  Fluores cein Angiography/ Fundus Photography  
The anatomical  state of the retinal vasculature of the study eye and fellow eye w ill be 
evaluated by FA/ FP at the screening visit  and end of study visit at Week 52. The FA/FP  from 
the screening visit (visit 1) will  be captured and transmitted to the central reading cent er for 
both eyes and reviewed before randomization for eligibility assessment . 
FA/FP images  from the end of study visit will be read by the investigator at the site, but the 
images must be transmitte d to the central reading center for archival.  
All FA/FP images will be archived electronically at the study sites as a part  of source 
documentation. 
Photography must be performed after testing visual acuity i f these procedures are to be 
carried out on the same  day. Fluorescein Angiography/Fundus Photography wi ll be done after 
other investigations including blood and urine sam ples are collected to avoid any interference 
from fluorescein . A detailed protocol for image acquisition and transmission will be pro vided 
in the study procedure manual. 
6.3.2 Safety Testing  
6.3.2.1  Adverse Event Assessment  
If subject reports  any symptoms before drug a dministration, they will be evaluated by 
medical staff and necessary measurements will be performed. The Principal Investigator or 
Medical  Sub-Investigator will be notified before dosing to  determine the course of action.  
Subjects will be routinely queried regarding the presence o r absence of adverse events using 
open ended questions.  The cl inic will provide documentation of any adverse even ts in the 
subject’s eCRF.  The adverse event source documentation will minimally include the 
following information:  date and time of assessment,  the outcome of the response, and 
identification of the clinic  staff member collecting the information.  
Arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of  study drug will be classifi ed 
according to Hicks et al, 2018  by an Independent Cardiovascul ar Adjudication Committee . 
For any potential a llergic reaction after administration  of study drug, diagnosis and 
assessment of anaphylaxis will be done  using NIAID/FAAN criteria of anaphylaxis; the 
management of anaphylaxis should follow the standard institutional practices 
(Appendix 11.1 )

Hematology and chemistry will be analyzed by central laboratory. Urinalysis will be 
conducted by dipstick at site and if urine is positive for blood, protein, nitrites, or le ukocyte 
esterase, will be analyzed via microscopy by a central laboratory.  
Additionally, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and INR will be do ne 
at screening.  For Czech Republic patients, additional tests of prothrombin time, activate d 
partial thromboplastin time and INR will be performed every three months (at Visit 6, 9, 12  
and 15) during the treatment period . 
Blood volumes to be collected and blood and urine sample handling instructions will be 
provided in the central vendor laboratory manual. The central laboratory will provide

If any blood sample could not be analyzed due to issues in the sample collection, processing 
or shipment, the investigator may repeat  the sampling to be analyzed in the central laboratory . 
Any clinically significan t findings in laboratory sa fety data should be recorded as an AE.  
Determination of c linical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's 
medical judgment.  
6.3.2.3  Vital  Signs  
Vital signs include BP, pulse rate and temperature. B lood pressure will be measured after the 
subject was sitting for 5 mins . Vital signs  will be measure d at times specified in Section  6.1 
and Section  6.2. 
Sitting  blood pressure will be measure d with the subje ct’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart  and recorded to the nearest mmHg after 5 minut es of  rest. Where possible, the same arm 
(preferably the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study. 
The same size blood pressure cuff, which h as been properly sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pressure each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring blood 
pressure (BP) and pulse rat e are acc eptable, although, when done manually, pulse rate will be 
measured in the brachial /radial artery f or at least 30 seconds.  Any clinically significant 
changes in blood pressure and pulse rate should be recorded as an AE. Determination of 
clinical si gnificanc e and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.

6.3.2.4  12-lead EC G 
In this study,  12-lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the study schedule in 
Section  6.1 and Section 6.2.  
To ens ure safety of the subject s, a medic ally qualified individual at the site will assess ECG 
recor dings and make any comparisons t o baseline measurements. The ECG data  (QT interval, 
heart rate [ HR], QRS duration, PR and RR interval) will be recorded. 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repe at abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as con tributing to the ECG abnormality . It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG reco rdings. Any clinically  
significant ECG abnormalities meas ured at screening should be assessed for their effects on 
subject eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history. Any clinical ly significant 
changes between the screening and subsequent ECG s sho uld be recorded as an AE. 
Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investiga tor's 
medical judgment.  
6.3.2.5  Target ed Physical Examination  
A targeted  physical examination will be performed at time points  specified in the stud y 
schedule in Section  6.1 and Section  6.2. The targeted p hysical examination will include

Shankar G et al., 2008 )  
All samples designated for immunogenicity evaluation will undergo a screening assay to 
detect the presence of antidrug antibo dies (ADA) against aflibercept. Samples  identified as 
positive in the screening assay will then be tested in a confirmatory assay. Confirmed positive 
samples will be further evaluate d for antibody titer and the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies against aflibercept.  
Additionally, free af libercept concentration in all the ADA samples will be de termined to 
evaluate drug tolerance status.

9 ADVERS E EVENT REPORTING  
9.1 Adverse events  
All observed or subject- reported AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the inves tigational product(s) will be reported as outlined in this section. 
Subjects will be provided a study diary to c apture adverse even ts in between the visits. The 
Investigator/designee will review information recorded in the study diary  during the visits.  
Study diary will be collected back from the Subject prior to study completion or early  
termination.  
The Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outc ome 
of all AEs and to assess whether it meets the  criteria for classifi cation as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Mylan. The Investigator is required to assess causali ty an d should 
obtain suff icient information to determine the causality of all AEs. All AEs will be followed 
until the event is resolved, deemed to be stable, or until the event is found to be due to 
another known cause (concurrent condition or medication) and cl inical judgment ind icates 
that further evaluation is not warranted with the sponsor concurring with that ass essment.  
9.2 Definitions  
9.2.1 Adverse Event s 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical investigation 
subject administer ed a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the product. An AE can therefore be a ny unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or dise ase, 
temporal ly associated with drug administration, whether or not related to the product. 
The above definition covers also cases of  
• Exacerbation of pre-existing diseases or conditions. 
o Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is 
an increase in the fre quency or severity, or a change in the quality of the 
disease or condition.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the cl inical sequelae of a s uspected drug-drug or drug-food 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se  will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose t aken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent; this should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
 
An AE will be  defined as a treatm ent-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if the first onset (or 
worsening, in the case of pre- existing disease ) is after the first a dministration of MYL -1701P 
or Eylea  after randomization through EOS/ET .  
AEs should be categorized as those rel ated to the Study eye, fellow  eye and systemic AEs.  
AEs reported from subjects receiving Anti -VEGF treatment in fellow  eye will be separately 
reported. 
9.2.2 Adverse Drug Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to an investigational product related to any dose of the 
investigation products should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phras e 
“responses to an investigational product” means that a causal relationship between an 
investigational product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by 
Confidential Page 67 of 517
either the reporting Investigator or the sponsor as having a reasonable causal relat ionship to 
an investi gational product will be designated as ADRs.  
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the study drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the 
AE must be treated a s if the relationship were “possible.”  
9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected AE or ADR is defined as one whose nature or severity is not consistent with 
the applicable reference safety information designated for the study. For exampl e, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepa tic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cer ebral thromboembolis m and cerebral vasculitis would be 
unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vasc ular accidents.  
The re ference safety document is the Investigator’s Brochure  for MYL -1701P. For Eylea  and 
any concomitant medication, the respective SmPC  or US prescribing information  will be the 
reference safety document.  
9.2.4 Serious Adverse Events  
A SAE is a ny untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. 
o NOTE: The term “ life-threatening ” in the defin ition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not 
refer to an event which hy pothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity. 
• Is a congenital anomaly. 
o NOTE: A congenital anomaly  in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to 
the study drug during pregnancy is considered an SAE. However, a newly 
diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has received the study drug is not 
considered an SAE unl ess it is suspected that the study drug interacted with a 
contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. The subject with new ly diagnosed 
pregnancy will discontinue receiving study treatment and will be followed -up 
every 3 months until d elivery or terminat ion to gather information about the 
outcome of the pregnancy.  
• Is an important medical event.  
o NOTE: Important Medical Event:  Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other sit uations serious, 
such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospit alization but may jeop ardize the subject and / or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
o For this protocol, any cancer, includi ng localized basal cell carcinoma, is 
considered an important medical event, to be reported as a SAE. 
• Requires inpatient hosp italization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
o NOTE: Inpatient hospitalization  is defined as 24 hours in a hospital or an  
overnight stay. Events NOT  to be reported as SAEs are hospitalizations for the 
following:  
Confidential Page 68 of 517
 Routine tre atment or monitoring o f the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition.  
 Treatment, which was elective or  pre-planned, for a pre-existing condition 
that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen. 
 Admission to  a hospital or other i nstitution for general care due to social or 
economic reasons (e.g., no access to local ambulatory medical care ). 
Treatment on an e mergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any 
of the definitions of serious given above an d not resulting in hos pital 
admission. 
Hospitalization  also does not include the following: 
 Rehabilitation facilities  
 Hospice facili ties 
 Respite care (e .g., caregiver relief) 
 Skilled nursing facilities  
 Nursing homes 
Any non- serious AE that is determined by the medical monitor/sponsor to be serious (per 
company policy or regulatory requirements) will be communicated to the Investigat or for 
reclassificatio n. To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be 
requested from the Investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in th e 
context of the clinical study . 
9.3 Management of Adverse Events  
AEs or  SAEs will be collec ted from the time the subject signs the informed consent form 
until the follow -up visit or 28 days afte r last dose of study treatment . Pre-existing diseases or 
conditions (reported at visit 1 in medical history) will not be considered as AEs unless there 
is an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the disease or 
condition. An SAE deemed  to be related  to the study drug by the Investigator in consultation 
with sponsor will be reported even after the Follow -up visit if reported b y subjects. 
9.3.1 Collection  
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events me eting the 
criteria and d efinition of an AE or SAE, as described previously. At each visit, the subject  
will be allowed time to sponta neously report any i ssues since the last visit or evaluation. The 
Investigator will then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non- leading  questions, 
such as  
o “How are you feeling?” 
o “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?”  
o “Have you taken any new medic ations since your last visit?”  
Any clinically relevant observations made by the Investigator during th e visit will also be 
considered AEs.  
The subject ’s diary should also be reviewed at each study visit for adverse events. W hen 
study di aries are issued, subjects will be appropriately educated by the study  designee on 
what constitutes an adverse event and instructed to record adverse events in the study diary in 
a timely manner.   
Confidential Page 69 of 517
9.3.2 Evaluation 
9.3.2.1  Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
The clini cal severity of an A E will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE Criteria Version 4.03. A 
copy of these criteria will be provided t o each study  site. If an AE is not listed in the CTCAE, 
its clinical severity will be classified as follows:  
Table 6: Clinical Se verity of Adverse Events 
The Investigator will use the terms defined below to describe the maximum inte nsity of the AE.  
Grade 1 – MILD  Does not interfere with subject 's usual function  
Grade 2 – MODERATE  Interferes to some extent with  subject 's usual fun ction  
Grade 3 – SEVERE Interferes significantly with subject 's usual function  
Grade 4 - LIFE -THREATEN ING Risk of death at time  of event  
Grade 5 – DEATH  Death related to AE  
If an AE is graded 4 or 5 according to the above criteria, t hen the AE meets the criteria for an 
SAE and the Investigator should immediately notify the sponsor or designee as described i n 
Section  9.3.2.8 . 
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classifica tion of 
intensity based on the CTCAE grading o r on the above table, whereas an SAE is an AE that 
meets any of the regulatory specified criteria req uired for designation as seriousness 
described in Section  9.2.4 . 
Confidential Page 70 of 517
9.3.2.2  Action Taken  
The possible actions taken for an AE are described in  Table 7. 
Table 7: Action Taken  for an Adverse Event  
Treatment interrupted  The treatment was tempo rarily interrupted  
Treatment withdrawn  The treatment was permanently discontinued  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or  refused  
No action taken  The AE did not require any int ervention  
Not applicable  AE occurred after study medication was pe rmanently withdrawn or 
subject  completed the treatment period  
9.3.2.3  Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
For all adverse events, the in vestigator must purs ue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whe ther it meets the criteria for 
classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to S ponsor or its 
designated representative . 
• The outcome at the time of last observ ation will be classified as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/resolving 
• Not recovered/not resolved  
• Fatal*  
• Unknown 
All ongoing AEs without fatal outcome (i.e., did not ca use death) will be r ecorded as not 
recovered/not resolved  at the time of death.  
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the A E results in death. If more than one AE is 
possibly related to the subject ’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the A E 
which is the most  plausible cause of death in the opin ion of the Investigator.  
Note:  although “fatal” is usually an eve nt outcome, events such as sudden death or 
unexplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
9.3.2.4  Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to 
determine the causality of the adverse  event. The investigator is required to assess causality 
of each AE.  
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of w hether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the inv estigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investiga tor must make an assessment of the relationship of each AE (serious and 
non-serious) to the study treatment(s) and record this relati onship in the CRF. 
In addition, if the Investigator deter mines an AE or SAE is associated with the protocol 
specified study  procedures, the Investigator must record this information about the causal 
relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report the assessment in 
accordance with the rep orting requirements, as applicable, AE or SAE. 
Factors that need t o be considered when making a causality assessment include:  
• Temporal relationship (e.g., time of onset) 
Confidential Page 71 of 517
• Clinical and pathological char acteristics of the event(s)  
• Pharmacological plausibility  
• Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history) 
• Drug Interactions 
• De-challenge/re -challenge 
• Dose relationship  
A suspected relationship (definite, probable, and possible) between the events and the study 
medication means, in general, that  there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessmen t of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs t o study treatment 
in accord ance with the following definitions  (Table 8): 
Table 8: Definition of Suspected Relationship between the Events and Study  Medication  
DEFINITELY Causal relationship is certain  F or Example: th e tem poral relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there i s a clinically 
compatible response to de -challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically  or phenomenolo gical ly, using a 
satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
PROBABLY  High degree of certainty for 
causal relationship  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, 
there is a clinical ly compatible r espon se to de -
challenge (re -challenge is not required), and other 
causes have been eliminated or are unlikel y. 
POSSIBLY  Causal relationship is 
uncertain  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the AE onset/course is  
reasonable or unkno wn, de -challenge information 
is either unknown or equivocal, and while other 
potential causes may or ma y not exist, a causal 
relationship to study drug does not appear probable . 
UNLIKELY  Not reasonabl y related 
although a causal relatio nship 
cannot be  ruled out  For Example: Event or laboratory test abnormality, 
with a time to drug intake that makes a relati onship 
improbable (but not impossible), or disease or other 
drugs provide plausible explanations . 
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATED No possible relationship  Th e tem poral relationship between drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug 
is impossible . 
 
If the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
related/unrelat ed, an alternative suspected etiology should preferably be provided (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercu rrent condition) wherever applicable and available.  
9.3.2.5  Documentation  
All AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the 
CRF with the following information; where appropriate:  
• AE name or term in standard medical terminol ogy 
• When the AE first occurred (start date and time); SAE start date is defined as the dat e 
the AE became serious  
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or date and time of last observation if 
ongoing, i.e., recovering or not recovered) 
Confidential Page 72 of 517
• Severity of the AE 
• Seriousness criteria (hospitalization, death, etc.)  
• Action taken with study medication as a result of AE  
• Outcome 
• Investigator’s opini on regarding th e AE  relationship to the study treatments  
9.3.2.6  Treatment of Adverse Events  
AEs that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by established standards of care. 
If such treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the reason s hould be documented 
in the CRF; this can include temporary interruption of study treatment. The decision about 
whether the subject may resume the study treatment will be made by the sponsor after 
consultation with the Investigator and/or medical monitor.  
9.3.2.7  Follow-up 
Any AE will be followed-up to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it ca n 
be explained by another known cause (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical 
judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warrant ed. All findings  relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject ’s medical record and recorded on th e 
appropriate CRF page.  
New information  and any important missing information from prior reports  on a SAE must  be 
provided promptly t o the study sponsor. In addition, the Investigator may be requested by 
Mylan/designee to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an expedited fashion. 
The investigator should respond to targeted follow-up requests as soon as possible and no 
later than 48 hours from receipt of the request.  
9.3.2.8  Notification  
For SAEs, the active reporting period to Mylan, begins from the time that the subject  
provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject ’s participation in the study, 
i.e., prior to u ndergoing any study- related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, 
through and including the follow up visit. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAE 
occurring any time after the active reporting period, the SAE must be promptly repo rted to 
Mylan onl y in case of reasonable causality (i.e. suspected ADR).  
The SAE reporting form  is to be completed for all s erious adverse events, signed by the 
Investigator, and emailed or faxed with supporting documentation (e.g., CRFs, hospital 
records, l aboratory repor ts). Subject  identity details (such as but not limited to name or 
clinic/hospital number) must not be visib le on SAE forms or any supporting documentation 
provided by the Investigator. These should be “blacked out” and replaced with the site and 
subject ’s study identification number on every page. 
At that time of first notification, the Investigator/designee s hould provide the following 
information via the SAE report form:  
• Protocol number 
• Reporter ( study site and Investigator)  
• Subject’s uni que identificati on number  
• Subject ’s age  
• Investigational medicinal product  
• Date of first dose of study  treatment  
• Date of l ast dose of study  treatment, if applicable  
• SAE term  
Confidential Page 73 of 517
• The seriousness criteria that were met  
• Investigator’s opinion of the relationship to the study tre atment  
• Severity  
• Start and stop (if applicable) of the event (date and time)  
• A brief description of the eve nt, outcome to date, and any actions taken 
• Concomitant medication at onset of the event 
• Relevant past history information  
• Relevant lab oratory test fin dings 
If the initial notification of an SAE is by telephone, within 24  hours of the initial telephone 
notification the Investigator must email the written SAE report form that describes the SAE 
to the Mylan Product Safety and Risk Managem ent department. 
The Investigator may be requested by Mylan to obtain specific additional follow-up 
information in an expedi ted fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed 
than that captured on the AE CRF. In general, this will include a description of the SAE in 
sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determina tion of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as 
concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the c ase of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Mylan.  
Any missing or additional relevant information concerning the SAE should be provided on a 
follow -up SAE Report Form. Ensure that any additional  information requested by the sponsor 
or designee about the event, as outlined above (e.g., hospital reports, autopsy report) is 
provided to the sponsor as soon as it is available. 
Sponsor Contact Information for Immediately Reportable Ev ents 
All SAEs must be notified within 24 hours by email (preferred) or fax  to: 
 
 
 
In the event that an electronic acknowledgment is not received within 24 hours for a SAE 
report submitted by email, please forward the report via  fax  
9.3.2.9 Regulatory Reporting  
All AEs, including suspected serious unexpected AEs will be reported in accordance with 
applicable local regulations. The Investigator is re quired to comply with applicable 
regulations (including local law and guidance) regarding notification to her/his regulatory 
authorities, ethics committees (ECs) and institutions.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs),  SAEs and other cases required by 
the concerned competent authorities will be reported by the sponsor or the sponsor’s 
representative to all concerned parties within the prescribed timeframe. The sponsor or 
representative will also submit periodic safety reports (for e.g., De velopment Safety Upda te 
Reports) as required by international regulations. 
9.4 Special Situations  
The Investigator should report any case of pregnancy within 24 hours via the pregnancy 
report form. Pregnancy exposures must be followed until a final outcome is determined (e.g., 
parturition, spontaneous or scheduled termination). 
Confidential Page 74 of 517

9.4.1 Pregnancy  
All women of childbearing potential who participate in the study  should be counseled on the 
need to practice adequate birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
study particip ation. Women should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if 
pregn ancy occurs or is suspected.  
Pregnancy testing will be conducted throughout the study , as detailed in the schedule of 
assessments. A woman who is found to be pregnant at the Screening  visit will be excluded 
from the study . A woman who becomes pregnant duri ng the study will be immediately 
discontinued from study treatment. Early discontinuation visit assessments should be 
performed as so on as possible after  learning of the preg nancy. This information should be 
captured in the pregnancy f orm and reported to M ylan Product Safety and Risk Management 
within 24 hours from the time of initial knowledge, even if beyond the closure of the clini cal 
database.  
While pregnancy itself is no t considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a  pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will b e reported to the s ponsor 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
considered to be an elective procedure and not an AE, nevertheless, Mylan requests that t he 
outcome ( e.g., elective term ination) be reported within 24 hours and sent as a follow-up on 
the Delivery and Infant Follow -up Form).  
The Investigator is also responsible for following up the pregnancy at 3 monthly interva ls 
until delivery or termination, informin g the sponsor about its outcome.  
9.4.2 Overdose, Medication Errors and Other Events  
Overdose, per se  of either study treatment or  a concomitant medication will not be reported as 
an AE; unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harmi ng intent. 
Signs, sy mptoms, and clinical sequelae associated with intentional overdose are to be 
recorded on the AE CRF pag e. Dosing and other medication errors are to be recorded as 
protocol deviations. 
9.4.3 Worsening of diabetic macular edema  
Medical occurren ces or symptoms of d eterioration that are  anticipated as part of the normal 
progression of DME of the study eye should be recorded as an AE only if judged by the 
investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in nature at  
any time during the study.  
When recording an unanticipated worsening of study eye DME on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
it is impor tant to convey the concept that the condition has changed by including applicable 
descriptors (e.g., “accelerated DME”). Events that are clearly consiste nt with the expected 
pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as AEs. In cases of 
ocular inflammation, diagnoses terms like iritis, iridocyclitis, vitritis, endophth almitis or 
uveitis should be used. 
9.5 Abnor mal Test Findings  
Abnormal laboratory fi ndings per se (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments  (e.g., ECG, X-rays, and vital signs) are not reported as AEs. However, abnormal 
findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with s igns and/or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (and recorded as an S AE if they 
Confidential Page 75 of 517
meet the criteria of being serious). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or othe r 
abnormal findings that are detecte d after study drug administration or tha t are present at 
baseline and worsen following the administration of study drug ar e included as AEs (and 
SAEs, if serious). The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgme nt in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding  or other abnormal as sessment is clinically 
significant. Broad guidance for determining whether an abno rmal objective test finding 
should be reported as an AE follows:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms and/or  
• The test result require s additional diagnost ic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
and/or 
• The test result leads to a chan ge in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose 
adjustments)  or discontinuation from the study , additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other t herapy; and/or 
• The te st result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or sponsor. 
 
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constit ute 
an AE.  
Any abnormal test result determined by retest to be an error does not require repor ting as an 
AE.

11 APPENDI X. 
11.1 Appendix: NIAID / FAAN clinical criteria for diagnosis and assessm ent of 
Anaphylaxis ( Sampson et al., 2006 ) 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any ONE of the following three criteria is fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset  of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of skin, mucosal tissue 
or both (e.g ., generalized hives , pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) AND AT 
LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING : 
a. Respiratory compromise  (e.g., dys pnea, wheeze -bronchosp asm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction  (e.g. , hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two (or more) of the following that occurred rapidly (minutes to several hours) afte r 
exposure to a likely  allergen  for that patient:  
a. Involvement of the skin or mucosal tissue  (e.g. , generalized hives, itch -flush, 
swollen  lips-tongue -uvula)  
b. Respiratory compromise  (e.g. , dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. Reduce d BP or associated sym ptom s (e.g. , hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
d. Persistent GI symptoms  (e.g. , crampy abdominal pain, vomi ting)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to a known  allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Infants and Children:  Low systolic BP (age specific), or greater than 30% decrease 
in systolic BP  
b. Adults: Systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg, or greater than 30 % decrease from 
baseline  
PEF- Peak expiratory flow; BP - blood pressure

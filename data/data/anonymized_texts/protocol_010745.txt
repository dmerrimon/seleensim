STUDY SYNOPSIS 
 
Sponsor:  General Electric Company, acting through its GE Healthcare Business  
Research Type:  This is a clinical , open label , non -randomized , prospective , single -site, non -blinded  
research study, that will enroll from the accessible women (ag ed >18 years) in the 
2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. The study w ill be conducted in two parts, 
including an initial pilot for determination of parameters  (Part 1)  and continued 
testing (Part 2).  
Regulatory Status:  This is a pre-market  research study of the following products:  
Pre-market :  Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System   
Post -market :  GE Corometrics* 170 Series Fetal Monitor  
Background and  
Rationale:  Fetal heart rate (FHR)  estimation is an important tool for assessment of fetal well -
being and development during pregnancy that is traditionally measured using M-
mode or Doppler methods on ultrasound systems.  The Vscan Access Ultrasound 
system is a diagnostic ultrasound imaging system manufactured by the study Sponsor, 
GE Healthcare (GEHC) and equipped with Assisted FHR , a novel investigational 
feature that enables visualization and measurement of fetal heart rate. This feature 
visually maps obs tetrical and abdominal anatomical structures and fluid and is intended 
to be used by qualified and trained primary and specialty health care professionals, including midwives, other paraprofessionals and general physicians.  The built -in preset 
workflows and protocols, particularly enable novice users to scan efficiently and conduct basic screening exams.   This  technology provides  an innovative way of 
assessing FHR  that is semi -automated and does not involve any manual 
measurements once the fetal heart is sc anned.  This study is being conducted to 
validate  procedural accuracy of the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound Syst em with 
Assisted FHR  Measurement  in users of all experience levels.

GE Healthcare - Confidential  
Procedures/  
Methods:  Subjects in the initial pilot period (Part 1) and validation  testing (Part 2) will 
undergo up to 45 minutes of ultrasound scanning, including up to 8 test scans on 
the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound Syste m with Assisted FHR (research device) and a 
conventional commercially available ultrasound device . Subjects will also undergo 
routine commercially available noninvasive FHR  monitoring as a reference.  All 
procedures will be conducted at a Sponsor, GE Healthcare (GEHC), facility. All 
members of the study staff will be qualified based on experience and trained prior to participation.  
 
The study population will consist of asymptomatic women ages 18 or older in the 
second (2
nd) and third (3rd) trimesters of pregnancy. Users will be instructed to use 
the VScan Access R2 device to take a 3 second video of the volunteer, which will 
result in a calculated fetal heart rate measurement from the monitor. Volunteers will also undergo routine commercially available FHR monitoring using the current standard of care.  
The first session  (Part 1)  will be a run -in session, in which the parameters and 
procedures will be a replica of the study but these results will not count towards 
the documented results. There  will be four (4) sessions following this run -in session  
(Part 2). Each of these session s will be approximately 3 -4 hours in length over a 
period of 1 -2 weeks.  
In each session, there will be 1- 2 users and 3 volunteers. The users will be 
instructed to take as many measurements as possible during the allotted time.  
Finalization  of the procedure to calculate accuracy is to be determined based on 
the run -in procedures executed in Part 1. The specific  proce dures for the 
measurement of accuracy which will be used for validation will be performed by the 
team during Part 1 of the study.   
Objectives : Data from Part 1 and Part 2 may be pooled or analyzed as separate subgroups,  as 
determined necessary by the sponsor. 
The primary objective  is to validate the accuracy of the VScan Access R2 
ultrasound assisted FHR measurement compared to the reference st andard in a 
pregnant population.  
The exploratory objective  is to collect usability data for further user experience 
optimization.  
The safety objective is to collect safety information, including type and number of 
AEs, SAEs, and other device issues.     
 
Endpoints : The primary endpoint   is FHR data from the investigational and 
comparator devices on a per -sample basis in bpm (beats per minute).  
The exploratory endpoint  is the number of subject cases containing  scan  
parameters  will be reported and descriptively summarized as necessary to  assist in 
evaluation of usability  of the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System . 
The safety endpoint  is the type  and number of AEs, SAEs, and device issues.

1. BACKGROUND AND JUSTI FICATION  
FHR  estimation is an important tool for assessment of fetal well -being and development during pregnancy that 
is traditionally measured using M -mode or Doppler methods on ultrasound systems  or with conventional 
acoustic systems. The Vscan Access R2 Assisted FHR method is an innovative way of assessing FHR  that is 
semi -automated and does not involve any manual measurements once fetal heart is scanned. Assisted FHR 
method may have clinical benefits, such as improved ease of  training  and utilization in real clinical cases.  
FHR  monitoring is important for prenatal care and can be used to indicate a variety of clinically relevant 
conditions in the mother and fetus, which is the subject of extensive research collaborations worldwide. 1 
Training clinicians  to perform accurate FHR  measurement s can be challenging  due to various discrepancies  in 
both practice and the acceptable standards for routine FHR  measurement.  
FHR  measurement  is important to clinical practice and widely considered safe and effective . A study by Ruma et 
al. 2 found that appropriate maternal -fetal care , including FHR  determination via obstetric ultrasound improves 
the outcomes of mothers and their infants , in part due to improved accuracy using advanced ultrasound 
techniques . This has been demonstrated in large clinical trials, including the Eurofetus study which examined 
second trimester ultrasounds prospectively .3 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) recommends 
medically necessary fetal ultrasound in the 2nd and 3rd trimester, which are widely considered to be safe for 
mother and fetus . 4, 5 
The Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System with its Assisted FHR  feature  has the potential to  improve the 
accuracy and reproducibility  assessment of FHR s for second and third trimester scans , and it also may reduce 
the variability between clinicians performing similar procedures. Results from this study may be useful for the 
evaluation of procedural accuracy of the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System with Assisted FHR  compared to  
the conventional methods of measuring FHR on ultrasound or Doppler devices.  
Justification for Use of GE -Operated Facility  
Diagnostic ultrasound device development is an iterative process that involves engineers making changes and 
adjustments and then evaluating those updates using human subjects. The process listed above is repeated until the product is functioning optimally. One of the key aspects of this process involved the engineer and the device operator viewing images together and discussing the performance of the features and changes under 
development during the human subject scanning session. In order for this cycle to function both efficiently and 
economically, it is critical that the human scanning occur in the same location as the Research and Development teams (i.e., onsite at Research Park facility).  
The expertise for the product development of the Ultrasound Devices in use under this Study resides at the GEHC Research Park, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, USA site. In particular, not only the personn el expertise, but 
certain specialized testing hardware and software to enable development of these Ultrasound Devices, components and accessories are located at the Research Park site.  
Facility expertise for product development includes:  
• Feasibility; new f eature pairings need to be evaluated.  
• Verification and Validation; necessary components of the design control cycle.  
• Image Quality; the primary determinant of the commercial success of an Ultrasound Device; and determined by a complex matrix of inputs.  
• Com plaint Resolution; replication of Device complaints in a laboratory controlled setting is an essential 
part of post- market surveillance.  
• Usability testing; to fulfill the requirement for products to have usability testing prior to completion of design outp ut requirements.

• System performance with new hardware and software features.  
• Ergonomics and Human Factors; essential part of safe, efficient, and successful product design.  
In summary, this study needs to be performed at the Research Park development site  because the location 
contains:  
1. Engineering expertise;  
2. Clinical domain expertise;  
3. User preferences (image quality, presets, knobology) expertise;  
4. Competitive benchmarks; and  
5. Clinical marketing teams.  
 Recommendations for Use of Ultrasound in Research  
The World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) includes over 51,155 members in the 
Regional Federations including the National Societies of Ultrasound in Europe (EFSUMB), in Asia (AFSUMB), in 
North America (AIUM), in Latin America (FLAUS), in Australasia (ASUM) and in Africa and Mediterranean Countries (MASU).
 4 The study is informed by the WFUMB summary guidance and recommendations for 
ultrasound examinations for diagnostic purposes as well as for non -diagnostic research and training. Because 
the exam is performed on a commercially available ultrasound system wi th exposure not exceeding that 
normally encountered in clinical practice, the study is considered to pose minimal risk to subjects and adhere to responsible use of ultrasound for research.  
 Device Risk and Benefit Analysis  
Diagnostic ultrasound devices, com ponents, and accessories are generally considered non -significant risk, and 
generate images through the use of sound waves rather than ionizing radiation. Diagnostic ultrasound devices share a well -understood safety profile.
 6, 7 These devices have been used since the 1950s and are considered one 
of the safest imaging modalities available with no confirmed adverse biological effects on humans. 8. 9    
This study involves having an ultrasound exam not require d for the subject’s clinical care. All ultrasound exams 
done for the study are performed on the the  Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System in a similar manner as routine 
non- invasive clinical ultrasound exams. Duration and exposure in this study do not exceed those typically 
encountered in clinical practice and thus involve similar risks as routine clinical ultrasound exams.  
Participating in  this study does not directly benefit subjects, but will provide images and case data that may 
benefit others in the future by helping to develop and improve new ultrasound technologies.  
 Established Safety Measures  
In order to minimize the risk of potentia l adverse biological events, known or unknown, as a result of exposure 
to ultrasound, the FDA has issued guidelines that require manufacturers of diagnostic Ultrasound devices for 510(k) to limit the acoustic output (energy) of the transducer, the Guidance  for Industry and FDA Staff - 
Information for Manufacturers Seeking Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and Transducers 
(2008). These limits, which are displayed on the instrument in the form of a thermal index (TI), both thermal 
index bon e (TIB) and thermal index soft tissue (TIS) and mechanical index (MI), in combination with guidance to 
the sonographer to limit the scan duration according to the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) minimizes the risk of a significant adverse  biological events.  
With these safety measures in place, extensive use of ultrasound in the past 30 years has been shown to be 
well tolerated in humans.

including the dwell time (i.e. the length of time that the Ultrasound beam is fixed on a specific tissue target), and 
the acoustic output (TIB,  TIC, MI) will be carefully monitored and will be kept within the FDA cleared/approved/ 
recommended levels.  All devices used in this study adhere to the limits for thermal index (TI), mechanical index 
(MI), and other factors set forth by the US Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry and FDA 
Staff - Information for Manufacturers Seeking Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and 
Transducers (2008), which references the “Standard for real -time display of thermal and mechanical acoustic 
output indices on diagnostic ultrasound equipment Revision 1,” AIUM/NEMA Standards Publication 
(AIUM/NEMA 2004a) and IEC 60601-2- 37 “Medical electrical equipment - Part 2 -37: Particular requirements for 
the safety of ultrasonic medical diagnostic and monitoring equipment” (IEC 2007). Biological effects of 
ultrasound are rare within these limits, and ultrasound scanning in this study is thus considered to pose minimal risk of adverse effects in research subjects.  
Concern over the bio effects of the acoustic output in vulnerable tissues, such as those of a developing fetus in 
utero; have been investigated since the 1970s.
 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 To date, obstetric scanning poses minimal risk to 
mother and fetus if the sonographer abides by the recommended guidelines for scanning obstetric patients set 
forth in the WFUMB Recommendations on Non- medical Use of Ultrasound (2013). 14  
 Controls and Minimization of Bias

 Anticipated Risks and Benefits  
The device  under study has undergone risk assessm ent, in accordance with International Standards 
Organization ( ISO) 14971, and risks have been mitigated to levels as low as reasonably possible (ALARP).  
The risks of study participation are  not expected to be greater than those of similar procedures routin ely 
conducted in clinical practice.  Post- trial care  or follow -up is not required by this study.  FHR  measurement  has 
been performed for over 20 years and shown to have an excellent safety profile for trained users, because it is non- interventional and does not impact maternal growth or fetal development.  
It is also noteworthy that continuous electronic FHR monitorin g has been linked to increases in cesarean 
sections and instrumental births, and therefore costs, without an associated improvement in perinatal outcomes.
 15, 16, 17 
There are no expected risks to subjects, operators, or others in this study beyond those of routine devices in clinical care.  Stresses induced on the fetus are minimal and are widely accepted to be well below harmful levels 
in clinical practice.
  18 
There are no expected risks to subjects,  operators,  or others in this study beyond those of similar de vices  
already used in clinical care . 
 Risk Category  and Rationale  
The Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound with  Assisted Fetal Heart Rate Measurement , as used in this study , is not  
considered a significant risk device per t he 21 CFR § 812.3 definition:  
1) it is not intended as an implant;  
2) is not purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life;  
3) is not for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health;  
4) and it does not otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, s afety, or welfare of a 
subject.  
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS

 Summary of Study Design  
This is a Clinical, pre-market open label , non-r andomized, prospective , single -site, non- blinded,  research study, 
that will enroll from the accessible adult (aged >18 years) female population in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of 
pregnancy. T he study will be conducted in two stages, beginning with a run -in study (Part 1), followed by a 
clinical study (Part 2). The results of the run -in pilot study will not be included in the results and data analysis; 
rather, Part 1 of this study will be used to test procedure s and determine any experimental factors that have yet 
to be defined. The study will be conducted at a GE -operated facility.  The study is expected to last approximately 
6 weeks. The study is not statistically powered for any measure, and is intended to evaluate procedural 
accuracy of the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System Assisted FHR  versus use of a conventional FHR  monitor 
(reference): GE Corometrics* 170 Series Fetal Monitor.  
 
4. STUDY  DESIGN  
 Study Population  
Adult women (aged >18 years) in  their 2nd or 3rd trimesters of pregnancy based on self -report, will be enrolled. A 
normal  FHR  usually ranges from 120 to 160 beats per minute (bpm). FHR rises through early pregnancy, peaking 
at 170 bpm (10 weeks), and then, decreases through the 2nd trim ester (~140 bpm by 20 weeks), until the end of 
the 3rd trimester (130 bpm at term).  19 This population of subject selected are feasible for the collection of 
representative FHR ultrasound scans, within a range suitable for validating  the feasibility and accuracy of the

Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System , with  Assisted FHR versus the conventio nal, commercially available GE 
Corometrics* 170 Series Fetal Monitor.  
 Number Subjects  
Up to 25 subjects will be included as part of this study to achieve the targeted number of complete and 
evaluable subjects. The target sample size for this study is 15 subjects.  This includes testing up to 5 subjects in 
Part 1 and 20 subjects in Part 2 of  the study. The sample size for both study parts is based on estimation 
necessary for study device evaluation and validation requirements. This study is not statistically powered for 
any measure.  
There is only a single population under study, which is inte nded to include a range of clinical cases 
representative of FHR exams conducted at a typical site. This protocol does not prospectively specify any 
quotas based on scan type or anatomy. However, the site should attempt to enroll a diverse range of subjects 
including race, ethnicities, and anatomies in order to test a range of features on the study device.  
 Prot ection of Vulnerable Subjects  
Vulnerable subjects are individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly 
influenc ed by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation or of retaliatory 
response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate.  
The Sponsor shall avoid improper influence on, or inducement of, the subject, monitor, any investigator(s), or 
other parties participating in, or contributing to, the clinical investigation.  
All investigators shall avoid improper influence on , or inducement of , the subject, Sponsor, monitor, other 
investigator(s), or othe r parties participating in , or contributing to , the clinical investigation.  
The study activities cannot otherwise be performed without the use of vulnerable populations  because FHR  can 
only be measured in pregnant women with viable fetuses.  
Pregnant women/ fetuses/neonates : Pregnant women, fetuses, and/or neonates will be subjects in this study. 
The purpose of this study involves meeting the health needs of these populations . The mother and the fetus will 
be placed at risk only to the minimum extent necessary to meet such needs, an d risk to the fetus will be 
minimal.

Part 1  5 Any experience  level  Pilot for determining   
Part 2  15 Approx. 4 Novice  and 1 
Experienced  Scanning with fixed 
parameters  
 Subject Procedure  
Subjects will be asked basic demographic and pregnancy status questions. Subjects will be screened for 
eligibility  and no other preparations are required to participate. Following consent, eligible subjects will be fitted 
with a conventional FHR  Monitor  while simultaneously undergoing a non -invasive abdominal ultrasound scan 
using the Vscan Access R2 system with Assisted FHR  and a commercially available ultrasound device (reference 
standard) . FHR s will be collected using both devices.   
Eight ( 8) paired u ltrasound scans with FHR  Monitor determination will be attempted for each subject 
participating in the study (a total of 16 scans each, 8 with the research device and 8 with the reference device). Each paired scan  will last approximately 5 minutes for both  determinations, for a total of approximately 40 
minutes of total ultrasound exposure. Breaks may be provided between scans based on operator availability or requests by the subject.  At least 2 operators will perform scanning for each subject.  
A prospecti ve blocked schedule detailing the order in which scanning will be conducted for each operator and 
subject  will be prepared before the start of subject scanning . 
Up to 5 clinicians (Experienced sonographers, Novice users e.g. newly qualified sonographers, n urses/midwives, 
etc.) - with an approximate 80 -20 split of novice vs. experienced - with respect to ultrasound familiarity & 
scanning experience will be aspired for.  
The resultant ultrasound and case data (including basic demographics; self -reported pregn ancy status; and 
information about when and how the ultrasound exam was conducted) will be collected for each subject.  
All procedures will be conducted at a Sponsor, GE Healthcare (GEHC), facility. All members of the study staff will 
be qualified based on experience and trained prior to participation.  
 Scan Operator s 
Approximately 5 clinician  ultrasound operators may participate in the study  at two skill levels:  
• Novice : Nurse, midwife, medical residents, or technologist with <3 years’ experience with obstetric 
ultrasonography

8. SAFETY  
The description, severity, and study device relatedness of any AE or SAE during the study will be recorded. 
Subjects will, if necessary, be provided with emergency care. In the event of any study device issues, the issues will be recorded. Safety reporting will be conducted as described in this protocol.  
 Anticipated Adverse Events   
FHR  determination with ultrasound is widely considered safe for 2nd and 3rd trimester pregnancies without 
significant comorbidities. 15, 16, 17 Because no  subjects will be enrolled that are in active labor or exhibit significant 
medical conditions that could pose risk of harm to mother or developing fetus , the risks of this study are 
expected to be the same as for conventional commercially available ultrasound devices for prenatal scanning.  
Diagnostic u ltrasound exams involve minimal risk because they use acoustic energy rather than X -rays or other 
types of ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is commonly used in p opulations  of pregnant women  and is not expected 
to pose additional risks to subjects. 20, 21 This study enrolls from a population of pregnant w omen that may 
foreseeably experience adverse events not related to the study device during the course of this study. In the even that the study staff observed any medical issues that could pose additional risk to the mother or

developing fetus, the subject  will be immediately withdrawn and referred for appropriate medical care outside 
of the study.  
Even though manifestation of risks during cardiac, pulmonary, and/or abdominal ultrasound exams is rare, 
ultrasound can produce effects on the body. Having an ul trasound exam involves some foreseeable risks that 
are not different from those routinely encountered in routine clinical ultrasound exams, which include:  
• Tissue warming  
• Discomfort 
• Skin irritation  
• Bruising  
• Abrasions or tears in the skin  
• In rare cases, formation of small pockets of gas in body fluids or tissues (cavitation) can occur. The long -
term effects of tissue heating and cavitation caused by ultrasound are not known.   
As part of this study, subjects will have an ultrasound exam as part of this study that is not required for clinical 
care. All study scans are completed using non -invasive methods on a commercially available ultrasound device. 
All exams are performed in a similar manner as routine clinical exams. Thus, study participat ion is not expected 
to pose additional risks to subjects beyond those of routine ultrasound scanning.  
There is always a chance of unexpected risks. Throughout the study, the Sponsor will evaluate and update safety information in study documents.  
 Adverse E vent Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) : any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medic al device [ISO 14155:2011 3.2 ]. This includes events related to the investigational device or 
the comparator and to the procedures involved. For users or other persons , this is restricted to events related 
to the investigational medical device.  
Serious Adv erse Event (SAE) : an adverse event that led to death; led to a serious deterioration in the health 
of the subject, that either resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, a permanent impairment of a body 
structure or a body function,  or in -patient or  prolonged hospitalization, or medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent life -threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to body structure or a body function; or led to 
fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. P lanned hospitalization for a pre -existing 
condition, or a procedure required by the protocol without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE [ISO 14155:2011 3.37].  
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) : an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device [ISO 
14155:2011 3.1]. This includes any adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device . 
This includes any event that is a result of a user error or intentional misuse of the investigational device [ISO 14155:2011 3.43].  
Serious Adverse D evice Effect (SADE) : an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic  of a serious adverse event [ISO 14155:2011 3.36].  
Device deficiency:  an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, 
safety , or performance , such as malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labelling [ISO 14155:2011 3.15].  
Unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE):  a serious adverse device effect , which by its nature, 
incidence, severity , or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report [ISO 
14155:2011 3.42]. In the United States, any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the study documents , will be reported in accordance with 
21 CFR § 812.3 and applicable law s and regulation s.

Performance of daily activities is influenced. Treatment of symptom(s) may be needed.  
 Severe: Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to cause the subject severe discomfort. Treatment for symptom(s)  may be given.  
• Serious (yes/no)  
• Causal relationship to investigational medical device?  (not related, possibly related, or related)  
 Not related : The adverse event is reasonably expected to be related to (or caused by) a 
concurrent illness, effect of another device/drug or other cause, and is unlikely related to the investigational product . 
 Possibly related : The adverse event is reasonably expected to be related to the investigational 
product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compa red to the potential 
relationship to investigational product . 
 Related : There is a strong relationship to investigational product or recurs on re -challenge, and 
another etiology is unlikely or there is no other reasonable medical explanation for the event.

A deviation is any instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the requirements of the protocol.  Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the protocol to protect the rights, safety , and 
wellbeing of human subjects may proceed without prior a pproval of the S ponsor and the EC/ competent 
authority ( CA). Such deviations shall be documented and r eported to the S ponsor and the EC as soon as 
possible. Deviations will be reported as:  
• Critical Deviations: Deviations that significantly affect the safety, efficacy, integrity , or conduct of  the 
study. These deviations must be reported to the Sponsor no later than 5 working days from awareness of occurrence and reported to the EC per the deviation reporting policy.  
• Non- Critical Deviations: Protocol deviations that do not  significantly affect  the safety, efficacy, 
integrity , or conduct of the trial. These deviations must be documented on the CRF  Protocol Deviation 
page and will be reviewed by the study monitor.  
Non- substantial modifications may be made during the normal course of device optimization , maintenance,  and 
feasibility testing. Non -substantial modifications will be communicated to the CA as soon as possible, if 
applicable, and to the EC per their policy .  
 Participant Information and Informed Consent   
The investigators will explain to each participant the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration of exposure to the investigational device  (if applicable), the potential risks and benefits , 
and any potential discomforts . Each participant will b e informed that participation in the study is voluntary , that 
she may withdraw from the study at any time , and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent 
medical assistance and treatment. The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by authorized individuals other than their treating physician.

All participants for the study will be provided an ICF  describing the study and providing sufficient information to 
allow the participant to make an informed decisi on about his/her participation in the study. Informed consent 
documents will be subject to approval by the EC prior to enrolling subject s in the study.  
The participant should read and consider the statement before signing and dating the ICF, and shall be given a 
copy of the signed document. The ICF  must also be signed and dated by the investigator (or his /her  designee) , 
and it shall be  retained as part of the study records.   
    Early Termination of the Study  
The Sponsor may terminate the study prematurely according to certain circumstances . Examples of such 
circumstances include ethical concerns, insufficient participant recruitment, participant safety concerns , 
alterations in accepted clinical practice that make the continuation of a clinical trial unwise, early evidence of 
benefit or harm of the research product, or for any other reason.  
 
10.    STATISTICAL METHODS  
   Statistical Hypothesis  
No statistical hypothesis is being tested in this study.  
   Sample Size Determination  
  
Up to 25 subjects will be included as part of this study to achieve the targeted number of complete and 
evaluable subjects. The target sample size for this study is 15 subjects.  This includes testing  up to 5 subjects in 
Part  1 and 20 subjects  in Part  2 of the study . The sample size for both study parts is based on estimation 
necessary for study device evaluation and validation requirements . This study is not statistically powered for 
any measure.  
Fewer subjects may be enrolled, at the discretion of the Spo nsor, if it is determined that necessary engineering 
development targets can be completed with a lesser number of subjects than the maximum enrollment of 25 . In 
such cases, the site will be notified in writing to discontinue enrollment.  
 Statistical Analysis 
No statistical  hypothesis  testing is prospectively planned. Gestational age /number and other variables or 
subgroups determined necessary by the Sponsor, at its discretion, will be summarized as tables and listings, 
which may include appropriate descripti ve statistics when applicable. Subject disposition and number of image 
sets collected will be summarized in the final report.  
 Interim Analysis  
No interim analyses are intended to be conducted as part of this study. The Sponsor may access the study data 
at any time during the study, as necessary for engineering purposes.  
 Handling of Missing Data

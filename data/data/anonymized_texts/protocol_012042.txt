  3 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
 
Many women fail to return to their pre -pregnancy weight postpartum (i.e., postpartum weight 
retention, PPWR).5-10 PPWR and interpregnancy weight gain are important predictors of long -term 
obesity risk.11-13 Despite gaining similar amounts of weight during pregnancy, Black women are more 
likely to retain and accrue considerable amounts of weight postpartum compared to White women.13-16 
PPWR and interpregnancy weight gain negatively impact maternal cardiometabolic health and increase 
risk for adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies which are more common among Black women and those of lower socioeconomic status.
17-24 Black and lower income women are also disproportionately 
burdened by obesity,25 which further increases the risk for PPWR, interpregnancy weight gain, and 
adverse health outcomes.26-28 Behavioral interventions to prevent PPWR have had limited success, 
particularly among women with obesity.29-32 Most PPWR interventions involve high participant burden 
and fail to sufficiently address both the psychological (e.g., low self- efficacy) and material (e.g., food 
insecurity) barriers and needs of low -income, minority women.31-36 One promising and novel alternative 
approach capable of overcoming many of these barriers is the provision of healthy, home -delivered 
meals. In non -pregnant populations, meal delivery has been used to help manage various conditions 
including obesity with cost-effective and encouraging results.37-43 Importantly, meal delivery for 
postpartum weight management may be sustainable given the cost -savings demonstrated in other 
populations and the recent expansion by public and private insurers to cover home -delivered 
meals.41,42,44- 46 Despite demonstrated success for managing other medical conditions, meal delivery for 
managing postpartum weight has not been studied.37-43,47 Thus, the purpose of the proposed pilot study 
is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a meal delivery intervention for postpartum weight loss 
among predominantly Black and low -income postpartum women with obesity using a single -group 
design.  Findings from this pilot study will inform future refinements to the intervention which we plan to 
test and further refine  in a future pilot study . 
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
An estimated 60 -75% of women fail to return to their pre -pregnancy weight (i.e., postpartum weight 
retention, PPWR) and up to 60% of women actually gain weight postpartum.  5-10 PPWR and 
interpregnancy weight gain are important predictors of long -term obesity risk .11-13 Women of lower 
socioeconomic status and from racial/ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected13 and 
represent “priority populations” (i.e., those deserving priority in public health and clinical efforts).48 
Despite gaining similar amounts of weight during pregnancy,13 Black women are estimated to retain an 
average of 6.4 pounds more and are twice as likely to retain more than 20 pounds at 1 -year postpartum 
compared to their White counterparts.14,15 Additionally, there is evidence of racial/ethnic differences in 
weight trajectories postpartum. On average, Black and White women lose similar amounts of weight across the first 6 weeks to 3 months postpartum, after which Black women exhibit gains in weig ht and 
body mass index (BMI) from 3 to 12 months postpartum while White women continue to lose weight across the first year postpartum.
49,50 Women with lower levels of education and those of lower income 
have also been shown to be an increased risk of PPWR.5,7 This is extremely concerning, as excess weight 
retention or weight gain following pregnancy may be particularly harmful, given evidence of preferential 
central fat deposition postpartum.51-53 Visceral adipose tissue, which is associated with several 
cardiometabolic risk factors,54,55 is estimated to increase by 30 -45% in the first year postpartum.51-53 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR 2025 
  4 PPWR and interpregnancy weight gain can exacerbate these unfavorable changes in body composition 
and cardiometabolic health, which can have important short - and long- term health implications.51,52,56,57 
PPWR and interpregnancy weight gain not only alter a woman’s future chronic disease trajectory, increasing the risk for new or worsening obesity,
11,12,58 but also increase risk for adverse outcomes in 
subsequent pregnancies including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,17 preterm delivery,18,19 and 
caesarean birth20,59 which are more common among women from priority populations.21-24 Black and 
lower income women are also disproportionately burdened by obesity,25 which further increases the risk 
for PPWR, interpregnancy weight gain, and adverse maternal- child health outcomes.26-28 Thus, there is 
great interest in effective interventions to improve postpartum weight management due to the 
important health implications for women and children, particularly among priority populations.  
 
Unfortunately, e ven the most intensive behavioral interventions, which typically focus on caloric 
restriction, improving diet, and/or increasing physical activity, have had limited success for PPWR, 
particularly among women with obesity.29-32,60 Based on meta -analyses, <2.5 -kg weight reductions are 
observed with postpartum lifestyle intervention compared to standard care.29,30,32 Lifestyle interventions 
for PPWR also show high levels of attrition and poor intervention adherence.29-32,60 The postpartum 
period is important not only for maternal weight management and long -term obesity risk, but also for 
preparing women for healthy subsequent pregnancies as part of preconception planning. Entering 
subsequent pregnancies with excess adiposity  increases the risk for PPWR,10,27 creating a cycle in which 
women accrue additional weight with each pregnancy, leading to new or worsening obesity.27 Exposure 
to maternal overweight/obesity in utero, in turn, increases the child’s subsequent risk for developing obesity,
61,62 type 2 diabetes,63-65 and cardiovascular disease.66 Thus, postpartum weight management 
interventions are needed to promote healthy weight and prevent new or worsening obesity among 
mothers, as well as to prevent complications in subsequent pregnancies and reduce offspring long- term 
risk for obesity and chr onic diseases.26,61,66 
 
Most postpartum weight management interventions are intensive, comprehensive, and involve high 
participant burden by requiring significant effort and psychological and physical resources (e.g., self-regulation, time, financial means, access to healthy food s).
32,33 Such interventions may not adequately 
address social determinants of health (SDH; e.g., income, education, race/ethnicity, access to care, residential environment) that contribute to disparities in PPWR and obesity in priority populations.
67 
Most PPWR interventions also fail to address psychological (e.g., stress, low self- efficacy) and material 
(e.g., food insecurity, transportation) barriers of low -income and minority women.31-36 Achieving 
meaningful behavior change may be especially challenging postpartum, as women face additional 
stressors and barriers including lack of time for cooking/shopping, limited access to healthy food, and 
lack of basic cooking skills.31,34- 36,68- 70 Women with a higher BMI may have more perceived barriers and 
lower self- efficacy to healthy behavior change postpartum.70 A simplified approach targeting a few key 
behaviors may be particularly well- suited for under -resourced  populations.71 Also, postpartum weight 
management strategies are needed that more effectively address insufficient and/or diminished effort and resources, which is particularly relevant for priority populations.  
 Meal delivery overcomes many barriers common to postpartum weight management interventions that disproportionately burden priority populations. The provision of prepared meals to women’s homes offers access to healthy food, thereby providing a physical and  financial resource to support healthy 
eating regardless of income, geographic location, or access to transportation. Meal delivery reduces time and effort involved for meal planning, shopping, and preparation and requires less cognitive and 
behavioral self -regulation. In addition, pre -portioned meals modify the home food environment, which 
can support healthy habit formation and improve weight outcomes.

Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0

  5  
Previous studies in non -postpartum populations demonstrate that meal delivery is an effective tool for 
managing weight, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.37-43 However, use of meal delivery to 
manage PPWR and promote the attainment of a health weight postpartum has not been studied. Meal 
delivery also has additional health benefits that may be particularly impactful postpartum. In non -
postpartum priority populat ions, the provision of home -delivered meals has been shown to improve 
food insecurity and self- efficacy, reduce stress, and participants report high levels of treatment 
satisfaction.40,74- 78 These factors may have important implications for promoting healthy weight loss 
postpartum. For instance, food insecurity has been associated with PPWR, and this association may be 
stronger among women with obesity.79 There is also evidence that lower self -efficacy for healthy 
behaviors and weight control may be an important predictor of PPWR,4 and women with obesity are 
more likely to report lower self- belief in their ability to manage their weight postpartum.70 Similarly, 
perceived stress has been shown to predict weight retention following childbirth.80 Thus, by potentially 
improving these constructs, meal delivery may confer additional benefits for postpartum weight 
management.  
 
The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a meal delivery intervention among predominantly Black and low -income postpartum women with obesity using a 
single -group design. If meal delivery is effective for managing weight postpartum, it may be sustainable 
given the cost -savings demonstrated in other populations (e.g., individuals with type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease).
37-41 In 2020, Medicare Advantage expanded to allow coverage of home -
delivered meals.44 More insurers are piloting meal delivery programs to address SDH for chronic disease 
management,45,46,81- 84 with hundreds of contracts between medically -tailored meal providers and health 
insurance plans nationwide.85 A growing number of meal delivery programs are participating in 
healthcare innovation projects and receiving reimbursement for Medicaid, Medicare, and dually -eligible 
populations in at least 17 states.46,81 Thus, there is the long- term possibility for meal delivery for 
maternal weight management postpartum to be offered as a covered health care service, thereby providing an accessible community resource and shift in health care policies.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
This study involves providing a healthy meal delivery intervention to promote weight loss among  low-
income mothers  who are 5 -45 weeks postpartum. Those with conditions that may put them at increased 
risk or unique nutritional needs that would make the meal delivery intervention inadvisable will be 
excluded.  Although unlikely, participants may experience normal and temporary physiologic reactions or 
weight fluctuations associated with healthy dietary changes, such as flatulence (frequency: rare; severity: mi ld). There is a risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to meals, which is judged to be low as 
participants self-select meals from provided menus with ingredients. Additionally,
 participants will be 
asked to report any food allergies or intolerances at baseline  and the PI (who is a registered dietitian)  
will work with the study’s meal delivery partner to accommodate participant food allergies and intolerances, as needed. Participants will also be provided with m eal plans designed by the PI ( who is a 
Regis tered and Licensed Dietitian ) in accordance with current micronutrient and macronutrient 
recommendations for postpartum women. Participants will be instructed to self- weigh at least once per 
week during the study intervention using a study -provided scale and  will be asked to report their weekly 
weight measurements using a Qualtrics  survey sent via email each week of the study intervention. 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  6 Concerning weight fluctuations (e.g., weight gain) will be reported to and reviewed by the PI. 
Concerning weight fluctuations will be investigated and adjustments will be made to meal plans or study procedures, if necessary. Participants will also be closely monitored for any negative effects relating to the meal delivery intervention. Should it be determined that continued participation is contraindicated 
for a participant, they will be withdrawn from the study. Given that this is a non -invasive meal deliv ery 
intervention for postpartum weight management, we do not anticipate that withdrawals will be 
common. There is a risk of foodborne illness with meal delivery which is judged to be low as  we are 
partnering with an experienced meal delivery company that operates in compliance with local, state, and federal food safety regulations. All meals will be delivered in insulated packaging with frozen gel packs to keep food cold in transit and meal delivery times will be scheduled with participants. In compliance w ith the Alabama Department of Public Health, home -delivered meals can be safely stored 
in the refrigerator for 7 days. Thus, fully prepared, refrigerated meals will be delivered once per week to participants’ homes. All meals will also come with re -heating  instructions. In the unlikely event a 
participant experiences distress from completing any of the self- report surveys, she will be allowed to 
skip items or discontinue the assessment.  There is a low risk of emotional or psychological discomfort 
from participants answering personal questions about their health, eating , and activity behaviors.  
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
Participants will receive 10 healthy meals per week during the 8- week study at no cost to them. 
Participants in the study may feel less stress by saving time on planning, shopping, and preparing meals, improving food insecurity, and may feel good about themselves by eating a healthier diet postpartum. Having a healthier diet and less stress postpartum could have mental and physical health benefits 
postpartum.  
 
Meal delivery may reduce postpartum weight retention and improve cardiometabolic health management, diet quality, food security, stress, and reduce barriers to healthy eating postpartum. This is important give that approximately 60 -75% of women fail to ret urn to their pre -pregnancy weight (i.e., 
postpartum weight retention) and many women gain weight postpartum. Postpartum weight retention and interpregnancy weight gain are important predictors of long- term obesity risk. Postpartum weight 
retention and inte rpregnancy weight gain negatively impact maternal cardiometabolic health and 
increase risk for adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies which are more common among Black women and those of lower socioeconomic status. Black and lower income women are also  
disproportionately burdened by obesity, which further increases the risk for postpartum weight retention, interpregnancy weight gain, and adverse health outcomes. To -date, traditional diet and 
weight management programs for postpartum women have been larg ely unsuccessful. Thus, promotion 
of healthy diet and postpartum weight loss may improve these outcomes. Participation in this study may enhance our understanding of meal delivery as a strategy for improving maternal health among underserved populations. G iven the health risks associated with postpartum weight retention and 
interpregnancy weight gain, and the challenges of successful weight management postpartum, such information is clinically relevant and has potential for public health impact. Ultimately,  results could 
inform public policy to leverage programs and/or modify insurance coverage to promote sustainability, which would have a meaningful public health impact on both short and long- term maternal health.  
  
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  7 3.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
  
This is a single -group intervention trial in which mothers who are 5 -45 weeks postpartum and enroll in 
the trial will receive 10 meals per week for a total of 8 -weeks.  
 Potentially eligible participants will be primarily recruited through the  UAB Center for Women’s 
Reproductive Health (CWRH). CWRH nursing staff will prescreen medical records of participants who 
delivered at UAB. Potentially eligible women will be approached in the postpartum recovery unit following delivery or at their 6 -week postpartum appointment by a CWRH research nurse and told about 
the study. Interested women who meet initial eligibility criteria will be contacted by study staff at 5 -45 
weeks postpartum to complete a secondary pre- screening via telephone to confirm eligibility.  
Supplemental recruitment will occur via flyers/ads distributed at UAB obstetrics/gynecological offices, UAB pediatrics clinics, UAB lactation centers, UAB Nurse Family Partnership, local day care centers and churches, local breastfeeding and/or parent support groups, and Birmingham neighborhood 
assoc iations. Interested women will respond via phone call or email to the public advertisements and be 
screened by phone.  
 
Interested and eligible women will be scheduled to attend an Enrollment/Baseline Assessment visit during which informed consent  will be completed. Those who consent to enroll in the study will then 
complete baseline study measurements including surveys and anthropometrics.  
 Within 1 -2 weeks of completing the baseline assessment, participants will receive their first study meal 
delivery order. All participants will receive the study meal delivery intervention for a total of 8 -weeks.  
During the study intervention, participants will be emailed a weekly Qualtrics survey to complete to 
report intervention adherence.  
 
During the final week of the study meal delivery intervention, participants will complete Follow -up 
(week 8) assessment visit measurements, including surveys and anthropometrics . 
 
3.2 END OF STUDY DEFINITION  
 While Primary Completion will be defined as the date of the week 8 follow -up assessment data 
collection of the last participant, the End of Study will be the date of completion of the participant 
medical record  data abstraction, as these data will provide necessary data  to characterize postpartum 
weight retention and necessary covariates for the conduct of our statistical analyses (e.g., accounting for gestational weight gain).  
  
4 STUDY POPULATION  
 
4.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
 To be eligible women must  meet the following inclusion criteria:  
• Medicaid eligible and/or have a household income at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty line  
• 18 years of age or older  
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  8 • Initiated prenatal care at a University of Alabama at Birmingham prenatal clinic  
• Experienced a healthy singleton pregnancy  
• 5-45 weeks postpartum at enrollment  
• Body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater at enrollment  
• Residing within the meal company's delivery radius  
• Willing to consent  
 
4.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
• Self-reported major health condition (such as renal disease, cancer, or Type 1 or Type 2 
diabetes)  
• Current treatment for severe psychiatric disorder (such as schizophrenia)  
• Past or current  diagnosis of anorexia or bulimia  
• Current use of medication expected to significantly impact body weight  
• Current substance abus e 
• Participation in another dietary and/or weight management intervention postpartum  
• Unable to understand and communicate in English  
• Unwilling or unable to consume study meals  
 
4.3 SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Interested women  who do not meet study inclusion criteria will be informed of this decision by study 
staff and reassured that this will not change the quality of the services and care that they  receive  
through the University of Alabama at Birmingham . 
 
4.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Recruitment will primarily occur through UAB Center for Women’s Reproductive Health (CWRH) 
inpatient research staff. For this, CWRH inpatient clinical research staff will perform chart reviews of women on the postpartum recovery unit (following delivery)  or who are attending their 6 -week 
postpartum checkup (6th floor of the Women and Infants Center). Participants who meet initial eligibility criteria based on the chart review will be approached by a CWRH inpatient research staff member to briefly tell the  potential participant about the study, give them a study flyer, and assess 
initial interest. Because enrollment will not occur until participants are 5 -45 weeks post -delivery, 
participants who are interested when approached by CWR H inpatient research staff will be asked to give 
their permission to be contacted when they are 5 -45 weeks postpartum to remind them about the 
study/confirm they are still interested in participating. Participant contact information will be collected 
for p articipants who opt -in to being contacted when they are within the 5 –45-week postpartum 
enrollment window by study staff. When potential participants recruited through the CWRH inpatient 
research staff are 5 -45 weeks post -delivery, they will complete a sec ondary pre -screening by telephone 
to confirm eligibility. Supplemental recruitment will occur via flyers/ads distributed at UAB obstetrics/gynecological offices, UAB pediatrics clinics, UAB lactation centers, UAB Nurse Family Partnership, local day care ce nters and churches, local breastfeeding and/or parent support groups, and 
Birmingham neighborhood associations. Interested women will respond via phone call or email to the public advertisements and be screened by phone.  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  9 While participants will receive  10 free meals/week for the duration of the 8 -weeks study, we will employ  
strategies (implemented with participants in both intervention arms) that we have found effective for 
retention , including: (1) providing gift cards of $ 40 for completion of baseline and follow -up data 
collection visits , with incentives paid after each assessment; (2) ensuring frequent contacts with 
participants through weekly check -ins to not only obtain meal orders but also  maintain engagement and 
foster open communication; and (3) providing reminder phone calls before scheduled study visits . 
  
5 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
5.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
 
5.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION  
 After completing baseline data collection , all participants will receive 10 fully prepared  lunch/dinner -
style meals per week for a total of 8 weeks. Prior studies indicate that providing 10 meals or meal 
replacements per week is effective for weight management.
43,86 We are partner ing with a local 
company, Nourish Foods , to prepare and deliver study  meals. Participants  will select the 10 meals that 
they want each week from a weekly rotating menu that includes nutrition and ingredient information to 
accommodate participants with food aversions or allergies. Participants place meal orders weekly with study staff who will submit orders to the meal delivery partner. During these weekly contacts, trained 
staff also provide brief behavioral support, including evidence -based strategies of problem -solving, 
action -planning, and p rinciples of motivational interviewing to help participan ts identify and navigate 
adherence barriers.
87-91 Staff will document the duration and topics discussed. Each week of the 
intervention, participants will be automatically sent an electronic survey to report the number of study -
provided meals consumed by participants (versus others in the household  versus thrown out ), as we 
understand meals may be shared in food insecure households. The study coordinator will be available 
when collecting weekly meal orders to help participants navigate these challenges in multi- member 
households. If a participant does not place their weekly order, study staff will select meals based on participant preferences and allergies collected at baseline. Meals will be delivered once per week to participants’ homes, which is in compliance with the Alabama Department of Public Health guidelines.  
 To supplement provided meals, p articipants will be given a study scale and instructed to weigh 
themselves at least once per week and report their weekly weight measurement on an automated weekly electronic survey . The study coordinator will monitor participant weights and report any 
concerning weight fluctuations to the PI who is a Registered Dietitian and can make adjustments to participant meal plans as needed to support health y weight loss postpartum.  This weight measurement 
will also allow study staff to track participant weight gain  across the intervention as the goal is to 
support participants in los ing 0.5 to 1 kg (or 1 to 2.2 pounds) of weight per week. To support adherence 
to the 0.5 to 1 kg (i.e., 1 to 2.2 pound) per week weight loss, participants will be given a Weight Tracking Sheet handout to help them track their weekly weight loss. Staff will also keep a Weight Tracking Sheet 
for each participant. To support the healthy integration of study meals within participants’ diets to promote 0.5 to 1 kg/week (i.e., 1 to 2.2 pounds/week) weight loss, participants will be given  a variety of 
written meal plans corresponding to their individual calorie goal, as well as relevant tools (i.e., measuring cups, portion size guides) to support use of meal plans, portion control, and appropriate integration of prepared meals into participant’s diets. Calories goals will be calculated using the USDA Dietary Reference Intake Calculator for Medical Professionals

  10 level, and lactation status as inputs, and reduced by 750 calories/day to promote weight loss of 0.5 to 1 
kg per week.93,94 Meal plans will comply with current micronutrient and macronutrient 
recommendations for postpartum women.95 Participants will also be given a Fast -Food Handout to help 
them select healthier meals when eating out.  
5.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
 Participants in the study receive 10 lunch/dinner -style meals per week delivered to their homes free of 
charge for a total of 8 -weeks. Participants  will select the 10 meals that they want each week from a 
weekly rotating menu that includes nutrition and ingredient information to accommodate participants with food aversions or allergies. Participants place meal orders weekly with study staff who will submit orders to the meal delivery partner. If a participant does not place their weekly order, study staff will 
select meals based on participant  preferences and allergies collected at baseline  to ensure they receive 
meals each week. Each week of the intervention, participants will be automatically sent an electronic 
survey to report the number of study -provided  meals consumed by participants (versus others in the 
household  versus thrown out ). 
 
5.2 STUDY INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE  
 
Participants place meal orders weekly with study staff who will submit orders to the meal delivery 
partner. If a participant does not place their weekly order, study staff will select meals based on participant preferences and allergies collected at baseline  to ensure they receive meals each week. Each 
week of the intervention, participants will be automatically sent an electronic survey to report the number of study -provided  meals consumed by participants (versus others in the household  versus 
thrown out ). Study staff completing weekly check- in calls with participants will document the duration 
and topics discussed.  
 
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND SUBJECT  
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
6.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
 Participants will continue to receive the study intervention for the 8- weeks study . The study 
intervention may be discontinued for a participant if a clinical adverse event (AE) or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study intervention would not be in 
the best interest of the subject.  
 
6.2 SUBJECT  DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
Subject s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a subject  from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  11 • If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
subject  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form, receive the study intervention , and subsequently 
withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued  from the study, will not be replaced.  
6.3 LOST TO FOLLOW- UP 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to complete 3  scheduled check -in visits in 
a row or fails to complete the follow -up visit  and is unable to be contacted by the study site  staff.  
 
The following actions must be taken if a subject  fails to be available for a required study visit:  
• The site will  attempt to contact the subject  and reschedule the missed visit and counsel the 
subject  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the subject  
wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will m ake every effort 
to regain contact with the subject  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified 
letter to the subject ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact 
attempts should be documented in the subject ’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the subject  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up. 
 
 
7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
7.1 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
 All study participants will complete 2 in -person study assessments: 1) Enrollment/Baseline Visit and 2) 
Week 8 Follow- up Visit. During the 8 -week meal delivery intervention, participants will also be sent a 
weekly electronic survey to report adherence with consuming the study meals ( the number of study -
provided meals consumed by participants [ versus others in the household  versus thrown out])  and to 
self- report their last weight measurement.  
 
Enrollment/Baseline Visit : This visit will take place when participants are 5 to 45 weeks post -delivery. 
Participants will come to the study laboratory and  the visit will take approximately 2 -2.5 hours. Staff will 
review the consent form in detail with the potential participant and answer all of their questions. After providing informed consent to participate in the study, the Baseline Visit will continue with the 
completion of the following:  
  
Weight and height measurements : Participant weight and height will be measured.  
  
Questionnaires : At the Baseline Visit (i.e., Study Visit 1), participants will complete the following 
questionnaires:  
• FORM 01: Food Allergies & Aversions  
• FORM 02: Demographics  
• Income Supplemental Questions Form  
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR 2025 
  12 • FORM 03: Pregnancy & Infant History  
• FORM 04: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)  
• FORM 05: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS -10) 
• FORM 06: Diet Satisfaction (DSAT -28) 
• FORM 07: Self -Efficacy  
• FORM 08: Barriers to Healthy Eating  
• FORM 09: Infant Feeding  
• FORM 10: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)  
• FORM 11: Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)  
• FORM 12: Nutrition Security Survey  
• Household Food Security Survey  
• International Physical Activity Questionnaire  
 
24-hour diet recalls : Participant 24 -hour dietary recalls will be collected using the Automated Self-
administered 24 -hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24). For this, participants will be asked to report 
everything they had to eat and drink during the previous day (from midnight -to-midnight) including 
any dietary supplements. The diet recall will take approximately 30 -45 minutes. Participants will be 
given measuring cups and spoons to assist them with estimating portion sizes when completing the diet recall. Participants will also be given the ASA24 Information handout to assist them with completing 2 additional dietary recalls after Study Visit 1. For this, in the 1 -2 weeks following Study 
Visit 1 (e.g., before beginning the meal delivery intervention) participants will be contacted to complete two additional 24 -hour dietary recalls. These recalls may be completed by participants 
using a unique login f or the ASA24 system or, if participants struggle to complete recalls or do not 
have internet or computer/tablet/cellphone access to complete the recalls themselves, a study staff member may complete the 24 -hour recall with the participant over the phone us ing ASA24. The 
ASA24 Dietary Assessment Tool is a free, web -based tool developed by the National Cancer Institute 
of the National Institutes of Health for the collection of 24 -hour dietary recalls for research. The 
ASA24 system does NOT collect any identif ying data for study participants. Rather, researchers 
specify a unique numeric identifier for each respondent. Researchers must use a separate system or 
database outside of the ASA24 system to store participant numeric identifiers.  
 
Intervention Data Collection : All N=11 women  who enroll in the study will receive the study meal 
delivery intervention. At the baseline visit, women who consent to participate in the study will meet with a trained study staff member who will explain the procedures for placing weekly meal orders and show them how to complete weekly online Qualtrics Surveys which will be sent to participants via email. Participants will be given a study scale and instructed to weigh themselves at least once per week and 
report their weekly wei ght measurement on the weekly Qualtrics survey. As part of the weekly emailed 
Qualtrics survey, participants will also be asked to report intervention adherence (e.g., number of study 
meals they ate versus others  versus that they threw away ), adverse events (e.g., flatulence, new or 
worsening gastroesophageal reflux), and satisfaction with the study meals.  Staff will complete weekly 
calls with participants  to obtain their meal orders  and to complete  a brief check -in to see on how they 
are doing and utilize motivational interviewing techniques to help women who are struggling to comply 
with the intervention to problem -solve and develop weekly goals . Staff will document the duration and 
topics discussed during weekly telephone contacts.  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR 2025 
  13 Week 8 Follow -up Visit : This visit will take place during the final week for the study meal delivery 
intervention. Participants will come to the study laboratory  and the visit will take approximately 2 -2.5 
hours. Participants will be asked to complete the following:  
 
Weight measurements : Participant weight will be measured with participants in light clothing and 
no shoes.  
 
Questionnaires : At the Follow- up Visit, participants will complete the following questionnaires:  
• FORM 04: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)  
• FORM 05: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS -10) 
• FORM 06: Diet Satisfaction (DSAT -28) 
• FORM 07: Self -Efficacy  
• FORM 08: Barriers to Healthy Eating  
• FORM 09: Infant Feeding  
• FORM 10: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)  
• FORM 11: Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)  
• FORM 12: Nutrition Security Survey  
• FORM 13: Health & Demographics Update  
• FORM 14: Program Satisfaction  
• Household Food Security Survey  
• International Physical Activity Questionnaire  
  
Semi -structured, one -on-one interview : Participants will complete a semi- structured, one -on-one 
interview with a member of the research team. These one- on-one interviews (lasting up to 60 
minutes) will be conducted using an interview guide. Interviews will be audio -recorded, transcribed 
verba tim, and the file will be erased after the transcripts have been verified for completeness. The 
transcription will not have any identifiable data included as participants will use anonymous names 
or nicknames during the  interview sessions. The recording will be stopped at the end of the 
interview.  
 
24-hour diet recalls (Follow -Up): Participants will be contacted on 3 separate days and asked to 
complete three 24 -hour dietary recalls over the last 2 weeks of the study intervention  (e.g., when 
participants are still receiving the meal delivery intervention) using the same procedures as described for the  Baseline Visit. Briefly, the 24 -hour recalls will either be completed directly by 
participants using the ASA24 system or will be completed over the phone with study staff (and study staff will enter participant recall information into A SA24). Participants will be asked to report 
everything they had to eat and drink during the previous day (from midnight -to-midnight) including 
any dietary supplements. Each diet recall will take approximately 30 -45 minutes. Participants will be 
sent a copy  of the How to Add a Nourish Meal Instructions handout that will instruct them on how 
to add one of the study -provided meals to a dietary recall in ASA24.  
 Participant Medical Records : A designated study staff member with appropriate  approvals will obtain 
access to participant medical records for the retrieval of: date at gestational age (weeks at first dating ultrasound, date (which will be used to calculate gestational age (weeks)) and weight measured at the first prenatal visit; maternal weight and date (which will be used to calculate gestational age (weeks)) at their last prenatal care visit; maternal weight (if available) and gestational age at delivery;  maternal 
diagnosis with gestational diabetes or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and mode of delivery.

7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
   
7.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
7.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  (of note, the term “life- threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ) 
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospital ization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
7.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
7.2.3.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AEs) , the following guidelines will be used to describe severi ty:  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious .” 
 
7.2.3.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by the clinician who 
examines and evaluates the subject  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study 
product must always be suspect.  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR 2025 
  15 • Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE , or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset,  or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
7.2.3.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
7.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits or via weekly electronic surveys sent to participants during the study 
intervention which asks participants to report potenti al AEs . 
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition  deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each episode.  
 
The Study Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the Study Coordinator  will inquire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization.  
 
7.2.5  ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All serious adverse events must be reported to the IRB according to regulatory requirement s. The 
Principal Investigator will immediately report to the sponsor any serious adverse event, whether or not 
considered study intervention related, including those listed in the protocol or package insert  and must 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless t here is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  16 study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator deems the event to be chronic or the subject  is stable. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
7.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
7.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
7.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UP s) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
 
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  17 8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of the 
study meal delivery intervention . Hypothesis 1: We will successfully achieve >80% intervention 
adherence, defined as consuming at least 80% of received study meals, during the 8 -week 
intervention.  
 
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  The secondary aim is to characterize the acceptability of the 
study meal delivery intervention. Hypothesis 2a: We will collect data to characterize study 
participation rate  and achieve <20% attrition. Hypothesis 2b: Participant reported diet 
satisfaction will show improvements from baseline to follow -up. 
 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
The goal of this pilot study was to collect preliminary data regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a 
meal delivery intervention among postpartum women. As this is a feasibility pilot with the primary goal of capturing process data , a formal power calculation was not conducted. Indeed, effect estimates 
based on small pilot studies are too imprecise  and should not be used to inform future trials.
96 Instead, 
we followed recommendations from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) that sample sizes for feasibility studies should be based on “practical considerations including participant flow, budgetary constraints, and the number of participants needed  to reasonably evaluate 
feasibility goals.” With these considerations in mind, the present study aimed to recruit a minimum of 10 participants and up to 20 participants based on the available budget . This was a single -group trial 
with the primary goal being to obtain process data and preliminary data to inform intervention refinements before pursuing funding for subsequent pilot testing.  
 
8.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
8.3.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
At each time of measurement, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic 
characteristics and process measures , including rates of study participant, retention, and intervention 
adherence . Average  values of outcome measures (e.g., diet satisfaction) will be calculated for baseline 
and follow -up. No formal statistical analyses will be conducted as this was a single group feasibility study 
that was not designed to be powered to detect statistical significance.   
 
8.3.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
For the primary endpoint of participant intervention adherence, the proportion of weekly study meals  
that participants reported a)they consumed, b) other household members consumed, and c) that were thrown away/uneaten will be calculated based on completed weekly electronic surveys.  
 
8.3.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
For secondary endpoints, study participation rate (p ercentage of eligible subjects who agreed to 
participate out of those who were screened ) and retention rate (percentage  of enrolled participants 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  18 who complete follow -up) will be calculated and reported. Visual representation of the flow of 
participants through the study will be reported through a CONSORT diagram. Change in participant 
satisfaction with the diet will be reported as the mean total diet satisfaction score, as well as the mean scores on subscales for Cost Factor and Planning & Preparation Factor, at baseline and follow -up will be 
reported.

8.3.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
Rates and severity of adverse events will be summarized using descriptive statistic s. 
 
8.3.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
 
At baseline, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics and outcome 
measures by study arm and for the entire sample.  
 
 
9 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
9.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
9.1.1.1  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO SUBJECT S 
 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
subject  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to conducting study screening 
procedures . A separate screening consent form will not be used.  
 
9.1.1.2  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.
 Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the subject  will be asked to read and review the document. T he 
investigator will explain the research study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise. A 
verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the subject ’s comprehension of the purposes, 
proc edures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research subjects.  Subject s will have 
the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The 
subject s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about 
it prior to agreeing to participate. The subject  will sign the informed consent document prior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study.  Subject s must be informed that participation is 
voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the 
informed consent document will be given to the subject s for their records. The informed consent 
process will be cond ucted and  documented in the source document (including the date), and the form 
signed, before the subject  undergoes any study -specific procedures.  The rights and welfare of the 
subject s will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be 
adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.

held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Principal Investigator.  
 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
 
Representatives of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) may inspect all documents and records required 
to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subject s in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to 
such records.  
 
The study subject ’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use 
during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as 
long a period as dictated by the reviewing  IRB and/or  Institutional policies . 
 
Study subject  research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be 
stored at the UAB Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine and Population 
Science  research office . This will not include the subject ’s contact or identifying information. Rather, 
individual subject s and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification number. 
The study data entry and study management systems used by research staff will be secured and 
passwo rd protected.

FOR206 Version Date: 03/12/24CONSENT FORM TO BE PART OF A RESEARCH STUDY
Title of Research:Feasibility of a meal delivery intervention for postpartum weight 
management
UAB IRB Protocol #:IRB-300010155
Principal Investigator:Camille Worthington, PhD, RDN, LDN
Sponsor:UAB Obesity Health Disparities Research Center
General Information You are being asked to take part in a research study. This research study is 
voluntary, meaning you do not have to take part in it. The procedures, risks, and 
benefits are fully described further in the consent form.
Purpose The purpose of the study is to test if a meal delivery program helps postpartum 
women like you have healthier diets and lose weight after having a baby.
Duration & Visits You will be in this study for up to 11 weeks.
Overview of Procedures This study will include 2 assessment study visits: one at the start of the study 
when you are 5-45 weeks post-delivery and another about 8 weeks later. Within 
two weeks of each visit, a study member will call you three times to ask you about 
everything you had to eat/drink the day before to learn about your diet. At both 
visits, you will also be asked to fill out questionnaires about your health, stress, 
activity level, and sleep. Within 1-2 weeks of completing the first study 
assessment visit, you will begin getting 10 study-provided meals per week 
delivered to your home for you to eat for a total of 8 weeks. While you are 
receiving the study meals, you will be asked to complete a weekly online survey 
and a brief phone call with a study member about how you are doing with the 
meal program. At the second study visit, you will also complete a one-on-one 
interview with a study member to give us feedback on how you liked the meal 
program.
Risks The most common risks may include normal reactions associated with healthy 
dietary changes, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, though this would be 
temporary. 
Benefits You may or may not benefit from being in this study.
Alternatives If you do not want to take part in the study, the alternative is to not participate.
Purpose of the Research Study
We are asking you to take part in a research study. The purpose of this research study is to test whether 
providing women, like you, who recently had a baby with 10 meals per week can help them have a healthier 
diet and lose weight. We are partnering with a local meal delivery company, Nourish Kitchen, to provide the 
study meals. You will get to select which meals you want from Nourish Kitchen’s weekly rotating menu of meal 
options. This is a pilot study, which is an initial small scale study to understand if the meal delivery program as 
we have designed it is well-liked and works for postpartum women. Therefore, we will also ask you to give us 
your feedback on how you like the meal delivery program and what changes you would like to see us make if 
we do more meal delivery programs like this in the future. You may want to talk about the study with your 
family, friends, or medical provider. If you do not understand parts of this form, please ask questions. This

FOR206 Version Date: 03/12/24study will enroll 20 women who are 5 to 45 weeks post-delivery and received their prenatal care at a 
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) clinic.
Study Participation & Procedures
If you agree to join the study, you will be asked to complete 2 study visits: 1) at the beginning of the study 
when you are 5-45 weeks post-delivery and 2) the second about 8 weeks later. Starting 1-2 weeks after you 
complete the first study visit, you will begin receiving 10 study-provided meals per week delivered to your 
home. These meals will be provided to you free of charge and you will get to choose your study meals from 
Nourish Kitchen’s rotating weekly menu. You will receive study meals for a total of 8 weeks. While you are 
receiving study meals, we will send you a brief electronic survey to complete once per week and call you each 
week to check-in on how you are doing and to get your meal delivery order for the next week.  We describe all 
of these components of the study in detail, below.
Study Visit 1: When you are 5-45 weeks postpartum, you will come to the UAB Medical Towers Building for the 
first study assessment visit. This visit will take about 2 to 2 ½ hours. We will go over the consent form. If you 
agree to be in the study, we will measure your weight and height to be sure you are eligible. You will complete 
a series of surveys asking you about your health, work and education, usual sleep habits and stress, food 
insecurity, diet, and physical activity. You will also be asked to complete 3 diet recalls to tell us about what you 
had to eat the day before: 1 recall will be done at Study Visit 1 and the other 2 diet recalls can be done on the 
computer at home or by telephone with a research staff member in the 1-2 weeks after Study Visit 1. We 
estimate the total time you will spend completing the 2 diet recalls at home will be about 1 to 1 ½ hours.
Study Meal Delivery Program: All 20 women who enroll in the study will receive the study meal delivery 
program. So, if you agree to be in the study, you will begin receiving the study meal delivery program after you 
complete Study Visit 1 (including the telephone diet recalls). You will begin receiving 10 study meals per week 
delivered to your home beginning when you are 5-47 weeks post-delivery and continuing for a total of 8 
weeks. Each week, a study staff member will call you to check-in to see how you are doing with eating your 
meals, help you problem-solve any challenges you are having, and take your meal order for the next week. All 
study meals will be provided and delivered by Nourish Kitchen, a local meal delivery company. Therefore, your 
contact information (name, phone number, email address, address where you want your meals delivered) will 
be shared with Nourish Kitchen and their staff so that they can schedule and deliver your study meals to your 
home each week. Nourish Kitchen publishes their menus, which change weekly, with ingredients on their 
website which you can use to help you decide which meals you want each week. Study staff will then place 
your meal order for you with Nourish Kitchen. Study meals will be delivered to you once per week by Nourish 
Kitchen. All study meals come with nutritional information and the ingredient list, as well as re-heating 
instructions. Meal expiration dates are clearly indicated on the label of each meal. You will also be given a 
variety of example meal plans to help show you what types of foods you should be eating outside of the study-
provided meals and a weight tracking sheet to help you gradually lose weight postpartum.
Each week of the study meal delivery program, you will be sent an electronic survey to complete to confirm 
you received your 10 meals for the week, to report how many of last week’s meals you ate and how much you 
enjoyed them, and to report any issues you think the meals are causing you (for instance, if you feel gassy after 
eating a study meal). At Study Visit 1, you will be given a weighing scale and asked to weigh yourself once per 
week during the study and to report your weekly weight as part of the weekly electronic survey. This is to help 
make sure that you are losing a healthy amount of weight postpartum while receiving the study meal delivery 
program.

FOR206 Version Date: 03/12/24Study Visit 2: During the last week of the study meal delivery program, you will be scheduled to come to the 
UAB Medical Towers Building to complete the second (and final) study visit. This study visit will take about 2 to 
2 ½ hours. We will measure your weight and you will be asked to complete a series of surveys (similar to Study 
Visit 1) and to participate in a one-on-one interview with a member of the research team. In the 1-2 weeks 
before your scheduled Study Visit 2, you will be asked to complete 3 diet recalls to tell us about what you had 
to eat the day before. We estimate the time you will spend completing the 3 telephone diet recalls will be 
about 1 ½ to 2 ¼ hours.
The study surveys and other measures you will be asked to complete at study visits and during the study meal 
delivery program are described in detail below.
Weight measurement (Visits 1 & 2; 2 minutes): We will measure your weight.
Height measurement (Visit 1 only, 4 minutes): We will measure your height.
Food Allergies & Aversions Survey (Study Visit 1 only; 3 minutes): Asks questions about any food 
allergies or food intolerances (e.g., lactose intolerance) that you have, as well as any strong food

about different statements related to eating healthy and losing weight after having a baby.
Barriers to Healthy Eating Survey (Study Visit 1 and Study Visit 2; 1-2 minutes): Asks you about certain 
barriers you may face related to eating healthy.
Infant Feeding Survey (Study Visit 1 and Study Visit 2; 4 minutes): Asks about the types of foods you are 
feeding your infant (e.g., breast milk, formula, solid foods).
Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (Study Visit 1 and Study Visit 2; 2 minutes): Asks questions about 
how you have been feeling over the past 7 days.

about the support you get from others around you.
Nutrition Security Survey (Study Visit 1 and Study Visit 2; 3 minutes): Asks about your household’s 
ability to decide what you eat over the past 30 days.
Household Food Security Survey (Study Visit 1 and Study Visit 2; 1-5 minutes): Asks about the food 
eaten in your household in the last 30 days and whether you were able to afford the food you need.
International Physical Activity Survey (Study Visit 1 and Study Visit 2; 25-30 minutes): Asks you about 
how much time you have usually spent doing different types of physical activities.
24-hour Diet Recalls (Study Visit 1 and by computer or telephone; 30-45 minutes per recall): The 24-
hour diet recall interview gets a detailed summary of all foods, drinks, and dietary supplements you 
had during a complete 24-hour period (from midnight-to-midnight) for the day before the interview. 
Information is collected on the time of each eating occasion, the type of meal (breakfast, lunch, 
supper, snack), and the location of the meal (home, school, other), as well as what and how much was 
consumed. You will be asked to complete 6 total diet recalls for the study: one at Study Visit 1 + two by 
Page 4 of 9
FOR206 Version Date: 03/12/24computer or telephone in the 1-2 weeks after Study Visit 1 + three by computer or telephone in the 1-
2 weeks before Study Visit 2.
Telephone Recall Availability Form (Study Visit 1 and Study Visit 2; 3-5 minutes): Asks you to indicate 
days of the weeks/times you are most likely to be available to receive a call to complete a 24-hour 
telephone diet recall. 
Weekly Electronic Survey (weekly during meal delivery program; 5 minutes): Each week of the meal 
delivery program, you will be emailed or texted a link to a study survey to indicate that you received

series of questions related to health concerns you have since having a baby, your expectations about 
the study meal delivery program, experience in the study meal delivery program, including program 
structure, delivery, and other resources, program engagement, ideas for future improvements, and 
additional information you want to provide that you think would be helpful for us to know. Your 
interview will take about 30-60 minutes to complete and will be audio-recorded using a digital 
recorder. Then, a written record of the audio recording will be typed. The written reports from the 
recording will give researchers helpful information to understand your and other participants’ 
experiences in the study meal delivery program and how to improve future meal delivery programs 
like this one. 
Medical Record Data: As part of this study, we will retrieve medical records from your most recent pregnancy. 
The information study investigators will receive from your medical records include the date and your 
gestational age at your first dating ultrasound during your most recent pregnancy; the date and your 
gestational age and weight from your first and last prenatal care visit for your most recent pregnancy; your 
gestational age when you gave birth; your weight at delivery; and information about your pregnancy/birth 
outcomes (including whether you were diagnosed with any medical condition during your pregnancy such as 
gestational diabetes or preeclampsia and whether you baby was delivered by Cesarean section or vaginally).
If you are currently or have used any illicit (street) drug(s) during your most recent pregnancy, we ask that you 
not participate in this study.
Additional Information:
Your de-identified private information (private information with all identifiers removed) may be used for 
future research studies or distributed to another researcher for future research studies without additional 
informed consent. This is only when there are no identifiers associated with the data.
Risks and Discomforts
The risks to you for participating in this study are judged to be low.
While unlikely, you may experience normal, temporary reactions associated with making new healthy 
diet changes, such as gastrointestinal discomfort or flatulence.
There is a risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to meals, but this is judged to be very low since you 
will be selecting your meals each week from menus with ingredients provided by Nourish Kitchen.
Page 5 of 9
FOR206 Version Date: 03/12/24There is a risk of foodborne illness with meal delivery, which is judged to be low as we are using an 
experienced company (Nourish Kitchen) that operates in compliance with local, state, and federal food 
safety regulations. All meals will be kept cold in transit and delivery times will be scheduled with you to 
ensure meals do not sit out too long. Meals also come with reheating instructions and are marked 
clearly with their expiration date.
Some questions on the study surveys ask about personal information, such as income and information 
about your health.  There is a small risk that you will feel uncomfortable or not want to answer these 
questions.  If this happens, you can choose to skip any questions at any time.
We will have to share your name, phone number, email address, and the address where you want your 
study meals delivered with a private meal delivery company we are contracting to provide study 
meals, Nourish Kitchen. By participating in this study, your name and contact information will be 
shared with Nourish Kitchen staff and delivery drivers to allow them to schedule and deliver your study 
meals. As such, there is a risk of loss of confidentiality associated with the information we provide to 
Nourish Kitchen. Only necessary information to provide you with the study meal delivery will be 
shared with Nourish Kitchen (this information is limited to your name, phone number, email address, 
and the address where you want your meal delivered). 
There is a risk of potential loss of privacy and confidentiality. This risk is small. We will take precautions 
to minimize this risk and assure confidentiality of data managed and stored at UAB. All self-reported 
questionnaire responses will only be identified by ID number. All interviews will be audio-recorded and 
transcribed but your name will not be used in transcripts. You do have the options to choose an 
anonymous name or nickname at the beginning of the interview. All data collected during this study 
will be securely stored as paper records in locked storage cabinets as well as electronic records. All 
electronic records will be stored on a secure, password-protected server. Only staff involved in the 
project will have access to records related to this research study.
Information for Women of Childbearing Potential, Nursing Mothers, and/or Men Capable of Fathering a 
Child
To be eligible to participate in this study, you must have had a baby within the last 5-45 weeks. The study is 
specifically designed for and targeting postpartum women. The provision of 10 healthy meals per week does 
not cause any extra risk to mothers who may be nursing.
Benefits
You may benefit from participating in this study, as all participants in the study will receive 10 healthy meals 
per week. These meals may make it easier for you to eat a healthier diet and lose weight after having a baby. 
Providing you with 10 meals per week free of charge may help you feel less stress by saving you time on 
planning, grocery shopping, and preparing meals; giving you access to healthier foods; and improving your 
food security (not having to worry about having enough food). Together, a healthier diet and less stress could 
have some benefits to your mental and physical health postpartum.
Because not much is known about how meal delivery postpartum can benefit mom’s health, your participation 
in this study may provide valuable information to the medical community to help us better understand if meal 
delivery-based programs could be used to improve mom’s weight and health after having a baby.
Alternatives
Your alternative is to not participate in this study.

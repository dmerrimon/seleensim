f: All patients should be screened for hepatitis risk factors and any past illnesses of hepatitis B and 
hepatitis C infection. It is highly recommended that patients positive HBV -DNA or HBsAg are treated 
prophylacticall y with an antiviral (e.g., Lamivudine) for 1- 2 weeks prior to receiving study drug (see Table 
5-3). The antiviral treatment should continue throughout the entire study period and for at least 4 weeks 
after the last dose of everolimus. Patients with viral h epatitis C risk factors should be screened for 
HCV RNA -PCR. Patients on antiviral prophylaxis treatment or positive HBV antibodies should be 
tested for HBV -DNA ≤ 7 days prior to the start of C1D1 and ≤ 72 hrs prior to D1 of each subsequent 
cycle to monitor  for reactivation. See Table 5- 4 for reactivation instructions. Patients with positive

disease is defined as: patients who have either relapsed while receiving adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) or have progressive disease while receiving 
an aromatase inhibitor for metastatic disease. (Patients previously treated with two or more prior doses of 
fulvestrant are not eligible. Patients who have received one prior dose  of fulvestrant within 28 days of 
randomization are eligible so long as they meet other eligibility criteria). Randomization will be 1:1, stratified for balancing purposes using ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), presence of measurable

19 BRIEF PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
(This section is provided as a brief summary  and is not a substitution for referring to the 
full protocol details . See protocol document sectio ns for complete details .) 
Schema  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is a P hase II study. 25 sites will be activated. 130 patients will be enrolled. There will be a balanced 
1:1 randomization of everolimus:placebo ( e.g., for every patient randomized to receive everolimus, one 
patient will be randomized to receive placebo).  
Patients will be treated for a maximum of 12 cycles  with fulvestrant plus everolimus/placebo during the 
Induction Phase. Induction treatment continues until there is evidence of progressive disease or  
unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 12 cycles (see Section 5.6). Patients with no evidence of 
progressive disease  who remain on study after completing  12 cycles of the Induction Phase are 
unblinded and proceed to the Continuation Phase. Patients in the Continuation Phase should continue to 
receive fulvestrant alone (if originally randomized to placebo) or in combination with everolimus (if 
originally randomized to everolimus) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in both 
the Induction and Continuation Phases should have tumor measurements performed every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week).
 
Patient Population  
• Patients must be postmenopausal and have stage IV disease or inoperable locally advanced disease.  
• Patients must have ER and/or PR -positiv e disease as determined by their local pathology or 
reference laboratory  by ASCO -CAP criteria . Tumors must be HER -2/neu negative or 
equivocal by standard ICH/FISH  or ICH/CISH methodologies  by ASCO -CAP criteria . 
• Patients must be Aromatase Inhibitor  (AI) resistant, defined as:  
o relapsed while receiving adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) or,  
o progressive disease while receiving an aromatase inhibitor for metastatic disease.  
Note: Patients may have received an endocrine agent (e.g., Tamoxifen) between the time of 
progression on an AI and registration.

23 1 I ntroduction  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
Endocrine therapy represents the foundation of treatment for hormone- receptor  
positive metastatic and locally advanced breast cancer. Multiple compounds in 
varying classes exist, and those most widely used include the selective estrogen 
receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and the selective estrogen 
receptor down- regulators (SERDs). Although the utility of these drugs is well 
established, as many as 50% of women with hormone- receptor pos itive breast cancer 
will fail to respond to endocrine treatment ( de novo resistance) . Moreover, those who 
do respond will inevitably develop acquired resistance.1 Resistance to endocrine 
therapy remains a serious clinical challenge.  
Basic scientific research into the mechanisms surrounding endocrine therapy resistance has been particularly intense in recent years. Advances in this area of 
investigation are driving the development of novel treatments and therapeutic 
strategies. For example, various signal transduction pathways, when activated, have been demonstrated to allow breast cancer cells to escape the effect of endocrine 
therapy. The Protein Kinase B (Akt/PKB), a downstream target in the PI3 kinase 
signaling pathway appears to play a vital role in drug resistance.
2 Several studies 
identify a close association between aberrant Akt signaling and tamoxifen resistance.3 
High levels of Akt activity confer resis tance to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and 
the selective estrogen receptor down- regulator fulvestrant.4 This Akt -induced 
resistance does not appear to be secondary to failure of these agents to inhibit the 
estrogen receptor α activity, but instead may lead to altered cell cycle and apoptotic 
response.5 Clinically, Akt/PKB activation in breast cancer appears to predict an 
inferior outcome among patients treated with endocrine therapy.6 
mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin, is a cytoplasmic protein kinase that acts as a central regulator of many biological processes involved in cellular proliferation, angiogenesis and metabolism. mTOR is a key protein involved in control and 
regulation of the cell’s translational machinery through multiple mechanisms including 
by directly activating or inhibiting ribosomal activity.
7 mTOR is a key intracellular point 
of convergence for a number of cellular signaling pathways, including Akt/PKB.8 
mTOR lies downstream to Akt/PKB, and targeted inhibition of this protein has emerged as an important therapeutic strategy in clinical oncology. Inhibition of mTOR activity has been shown to restore tamoxifen response in breast cancer cells with 
aberrant Akt activity.
9 
Everolimus is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the mTOR pathway. Combination treatment with everolimus and either letrozole or fulvestrant has been shown to 
reverse Akt -mediated endocrine therapy resistance and restore responsiveness to 
anti-estrogens in preclinical studies.
5 These observations formed the rationale leading 
to the Phase I clinical trial evaluating the combination of everolimus and letrozole in women previously treated with letrozole ≥ 4 months without objective response (e.g., 
stable or progressive disease). Eighteen postmenopausal female patients with 
advanced HR
+ breast cancer were treated with letrozole 2.5 mg/day and everolimus 
at 5 mg/day (cohort 1) or 10 mg/day (cohort 2).10 Overall the combination was well 
tolerated and toxicities were manageable and consistent with that expected for

24 everolimus monotherapy. The results suggest antitumor activity for this combination 
without Pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions. 
This study will examine the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of fulvestrant 
and everolimus for the treatment of postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer resistant to an aromatase inhibitor. 
1.2 Breast Cancer  
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide. In the United States, an estimated 230,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer were  
diagnosed in 2011, with 39,520 breast cancer deaths .
11 Despite the recent advances 
in breast cancer therapy, 40- 80% of women with node- positive disease and up to 
30% of women with node- negative disease at diagnosis will relapse. When distant 
metastases occur, the prognosis remains  poor with a median survival of 18 to 36 
months from time of recurrence.  Among the 60- 70% of women with hor mone -receptor 
positive breast cancer, 40- 60% of them will benefit from endocrine therapy. Endocrine 
therapy has shown to yield similar survival rates in hormone- sensitive disease as 
compared to chemotherapy; although response rates are  lower and responses  
develop more slowly. Endocrine therapy is  considerably less toxic than 
chemotherapy, and is therefore the preferred treatment option for patients with 
hormone -receptor (HR) -positive disease.12,13 Chemotherapy is generally indicated in 
HR-negative disease, in cases unresponsive to endocrine therapy, or when extensive 
metastases require rapid tumor response.14 
1.3 Endocrine Therapy for B reast Cancer  
Several endocrine therapies are available for the treatment of metastatic breast 
cancer in postmenopausal women, including selective estrogen- receptor modulators 
(SERMs), aromatase inhibitors (AIs), progestins, androgens, and most recently the  
selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs - e.g., fulvestrant). Tamoxifen 
was generally regarded as a standard option in HR -positive disease for adjuvant 
therapy, and for first -line therapy of metastatic disease in postmenopausal women. 
Within the past decade, howe ver, the AIs (letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) have 
supplanted tamoxifen as the preferred choice for adjuvant therapy and metastatic disease in postmenopausal women.
15,16 There is therefore a need to develop more 
effective endocrine therapies for patients with AI -resistant disease, and to enhance 
the effectiveness of existing endocrine therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in AI-resistant disease.  
1.3.1  Fulvestrant for Post Menopausal Women with Br east Cancer  
Fulvestrant (Faslodex®, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, DE) has 
several unique characteristics. It is the first drug which acts as a pure estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist without known agonist effects. It competitively binds to the  
ERs with an approximately 100 times greater affinity than that of tamoxifen. Fulvestrant promotes the degradation of ERs and subsequently prevents ER -
mediated gene transcription. Two studies that led to the approval of fulvestrant were 
performed in postmenopausal women with HR -positive metastatic breast cancer who 
had progressive disease after tamoxifen therapy. These trials compared fulvestrant

25 (250 mg IM  injection monthly) with anastrozole (1 mg PO daily) (Table 1-0).17,18 The 
primary endpoint for both studies was time to disease progression (TTP), which was 
similar between the two treatment arms (5.4 versus 3.4 months in the North American 
trial, and 5.5 versus 5.1 months in the European trial). Secondary endpoints were also comparable. The response rate for fulvestrant was 17- 20% (versus 15.7- 17.5% 
for anastrozole), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) was 42- 45% (versus 36- 45% for 
anastrozole), median duration of response was 15- 19 months (versus 11- 15 months 
for anastrozole), and median time to disease progression (TTP) was 5.5 months 
(versus 3.4- 5.1 months for anastrozole). Further subgroups analyses confirm the 
clinical activity of fulvestrant in both visceral and non- visceral metastatic disease as 
compared with anastr ozole.
19 These trials led to the approval of  Faslodex® 
(fulvestrant) Injection for “…the treatment of hormone -receptor  positive metastatic 
breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following 
antiestrogen therapy ”.

Fulvestrant has  also been compared with tamoxifen as first line therapy in a Phase III 
trial that included 587 postmenopausal women with HR -positive metastatic breast 
cancer , but proved to be no more effective than tamoxifen in this setting.20 When 
comparing fulvestrant with tamoxifen, the objective response rate (34% versus 32%) 
and clinical benefit rate (57% versus 62%) were similar.  
1.3.2  Fulvestrant for Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) Resistant Disease  
Several trials have evaluated the role of fulvestrant in AI -resistant disease, as 
summarized in Table 1-1.

The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) fo r patients with AI -resistant disease is approximately 
20-30%, and median TTP is approximately 3.5 months. In the EFECT trial reported by 
Chia et al, patients who had progressive disease after treatment with a non- steroidal 
AI (anastrozole, letrozole) were randomized to fulvestrant or the steroidal aromatase 
inhibitor exemestane. In contrast to most other trials that utilized a single 250 mg 
monthly dose based upon the original pharmacokinetic studies,23 patients in the 
EFECT trial received a 500 mg loading dose on day 1, then 250 mg on day 15 and 28 
(then every 4 weeks thereafter) based upon recent evidence that this dose/schedule 
may more rapidly achieve therapeutic blood levels. There was no significant difference in CBR between the two treatment arms. Nevertheless, the EFECT trial 
confirmed the effectiveness of fulvestrant previously reported in other smaller trials of fulvestrant in AI -resistant disease.  
Previous trials had demonstrated that a dose of 125 mg was less effective than the 
250 mg monthly dose.
16,20 Based upon evidence that dosing schedules higher than 
the 250 mg monthly dose may produce greater clinical benefit, several tri als 
evaluated alternative dosing schedules (similar to that used in the EFECT trial), including FINDER I ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), FINDER II ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and CONFIRM 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
1.3.3  Rationale for Fulvestrant for this Trial  
Fulvestrant has demonstrated activity when used as first, second, or third line 
endocrine therapy, making it an attractive therapy for combination with other agents. 
In addition, it is commonly reserved for use following  disease progression on AI 
therapy.  The loading dose schedule employed in the EFECT trial will be used in this 
study taking advantage of the know n dose- response effect observed for fulvestrant, 
the more rapid achievement of therapeutic blood levels, the extensive efficacy and safety experience with this schedule, and because it appears to be emerging as the 
preferred schedule for fulvestrant based upon the results of ongoing and recently 
completed clinical trials.  
The recently reported CONFIRM trial compared fulvestrant dosing of 250 mg every 
28 days (the previously FDA -approved dose)  with 500 mg on days 1, 14, 28 and 
every 2 8 days thereafter (the current  FDA-approved dose).
24 The study demonstrated 
that the higher dose was more effective. Median time to progression (TTP) was 6.5 months with the higher dose compared with 5.5 months with the lower dose (HR 0.8, 
p=0.006). The CBR was 45%, with the high dose as compared to 39.6% with the low dose arm (odds ratio 1.28, p=0.10). In the subgroup of patients who had

Date: 1/22/2014 
27 relapsed/progressed on an aromatase inhibitor (the population targeted in this study), 
median TTP was 5.4 months with the high -dose arm, and 4.1 months on the standar d 
arm (with CBRs of 36% and 32% respectively). We will therefore use the high- dose 
regimen as utilized in the CONFIRM trial.24 
1.4 Everolimus (RAD001)  
Everolimus (RAD001) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin that is an m -TOR 
inhibitor.  
Everolimus  has been in clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in 
solid organ transplantation. Everolimus is approved in Europe and other global 
markets (trade name: Certican®) for cardiac and renal transplantation, and in the 
United States (trade name: Zortress®) for the prevention of organ rejection of kidney 
transplantation.   
Everolimus was developed in oncology as Afinitor® and was approved for advanced 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 2009. In 2010, Afinitor® received United States (US) 
approval for patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated 
with tuberous sclerosis (TS). Everolimus is also available as Votubia® in the 
European Union (EU) for patients with SEGA associated with TS. Afinitor® was 
approved for “progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease” in 2011 in various countries, 
including the US and Europe.  
In 2012 Afinitor® received approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with 
advanced hormone receptor -positive, HER2 -negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ 
BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or 
anastrozole. Furthermore in 2012, Afinitor
® received approval for the treatment of 
patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC) who have renal angiomyolipoma not 
requiring immediate surgery.  
Everolimus  is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:  
• Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation. 
• Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via 
potent inhibition of t umor cell HIF -1 activity, VEGF production and VEGF -induced 
proliferation of endothelial cells). The role of angiogenesis in the maintenance of solid tumor growth is well established, and the mTOR pathway has been 
implicated in the regulation of tumor production of proangiogenic factors as well as modulation of VEGFR signaling in endothelial cells.  
At weekly and daily schedules and at various doses explored, everolimus is generally 
well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events (rash, mucositis, fatigue an d 
headache) associated with everolimus therapy are manageable. Non-infectious 
pneumonitis has been reported with mTOR inhibitors but is commonly low -grade and 
reversible.  
1.4.1  mTOR Pathway and Mechanism of Action  
At cellular and molecular levels, everolimus  acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. 
Everolimus  selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), specifically 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/2014 
28 targeting the mTOR -raptor signal transduction complex. mTOR is  a key and highly 
conserved serine- threonine kinase which is present in all cells and is a central 
regulator of protein synthesis and ultimately cell growth, cell proliferation, 
angiogenesis and cell survival. mTOR is the only currently known target of everolimus.
25 
mTOR is downstream of PI3K/AKT pathway, a pathway known to be dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers (e.g. through loss/mutation of the PTEN negative regulator; through PI3K mutation/amplification; through AKT/PKB overexpression/  
overactivation; through modulation of TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressors). In addition, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is associated with worsening prognosis through increased aggressiveness, resistanc e to t reatment and progression. 
The main known functions of mTOR include the following :
7,25 
• mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors and energy , and nutrient 
levels, facilitating cell- cycle progression from G1 to S phase in appropriate growth 
conditions.  
• The PI3K -mTOR pathway itself is frequently activated in many human cancers, 
and oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors.  
• Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins (4E -BP1) and 
activating the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases ( e.g., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates protein 
translation, including the HIF- 1 proteins . Inhibition of mTOR is expected to lead to 
decreased expression of HIF- 1. 
• The activation of mTOR pathway is involved in the production of pro- angioge nic 
factors (i.e., VEGF) and inhibition of endothelial cell growth and proliferation. 
• The regulation of mTOR signaling is complex and involves positive regulators, 
such as AKT that phosphorylate and inactivate negative regulators such as the 
Tuberous Scler osis Complex (TSC1/TSC2).  
mTOR is represented by two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein 
signaling complexes, mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1, rapamycin sensitive) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2, rapamycin insensitive) .
26 
mTORC1 is mainly activated via the PI3 kinase pathway through AKT (also known as 
PKB, protein kinase B) and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) .7 Activated 
AKT phosphorylates TSC2, which leads to the dissociation of TSC1/TSC2 complex, 
thus inhibiting the ability of TSC2 to act as a GTPase activating protein. This allows 
Rheb, a small G- protein,  to remain in a GTP bound state and to activate mTORC1. 
AKT can also activate mTORC1 by PRAS40 phosphorylation, thereby relieving the 
PRAS40 -mediated inhibition of mTORC1.27,28  
mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) is activated through a currently unknown mechanism, possibly by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling .
27 It has been suggested that 
mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates a different pool of AKT that is not upstream of 
mTORC1. PHLPP phosph atase plays a role of a negative regulator. mTORC2 is 
rapamycin insensitive and is required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.26 
mTORC1 -mediated signaling is subject to modulation by the macrocyclic lactone 
rapamycin and its derivatives, such as everolimus . Once these agents bind to the 12 
kDa cytosolic FK506- binding protein immunophilin FKBP12, the resulting rapamycin-
FKBP12 complexes bind to a specific site near the catalytic domain of mTORC1 and

29 inhibit phosphorylation of mTOR substrates. As a consequence, downstream 
signaling events involved in regulation of the G1 to S -phase transition are inhibited. 
This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin as well as its putative antineoplastic activity .
29 As many cancers are 
characterized by dysregulation of G1 transit (for example, overexpression of cyclin or 
cyclin -dependent kinases), inhibition of mTOR becomes an intriguing target for 
inducing cytostasis .7 
1.4.1.1  Preclinical Studies  
Everolimus  acts as an inhibitor of cytokine  and growth- factor -dependent proliferation 
of cells. The only currently known target of everolimus  is mTOR, a key regulator y 
protein affecting cell growth .25 Everolimus  exerts its activity through high affinity 
interaction with an intracellular receptor protein, the immunophilin FKBP12. The  
FKBP12/ everolimus  complex subsequently interacts with the mTOR protein kinase, 
inhibiting  downstream signaling events involved in regulation of the G1 to S -phase 
transition.  
The main known functions of mTOR include:  
• Function as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors, energy and nutrient levels, 
facilitating  cell-cycle progression from G1 - S phase in appropriate growth 
conditions.  
• Regulation of protein synthesis important for tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis  through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins 
and activating the 40S  ribosomal S6 kinases (e.g. p70S6K1).  For example, 
activation of the mTOR pathway  leads to a) increased production of pro -
angiogenic factors (e.g. VEGF) in tumors b) tumor, endothelial and smooth 
muscle cell growth and proliferation.  
The PI3K -mTOR pathway itself is frequently activated in many human cancers, and  
oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors. The 
regulation of  mTOR signaling is complex and involves positive regulators such as 
AKT that phosphorylate and inactivate negative regulators such as the Tuberous 
Sclerosis Complex (TSC1/TSC2). In summary, mTOR has pleiotropic functions; 
hence, the activities of everolimus  may vary depending upon cell type.  
The mTOR inhibitory activities presumably contribute to the anti -proliferative activity 
of everolimus  against tumor cell lines. However, everolimus  may also exert an 
antitumor effect  through the inhibition of angiogenesis. Indeed, both rapamycin and 
everolimus  potently  inhibit proliferation of endothelial cells and have antiangiogenic 
activity in vivo .
30,31 Exactly which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of 
tumor cells to everolimus  is still unclear. Currently, the activation status of the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70 S6K pathway may  be indicative of responsiveness to 
rapamycins. For example, pre- clinically, loss of PTEN or  constitutive/hyper -activation 
of AKT has been suggested to sensitize tumors to the effects of  inhibition of 
mTOR .25,31 Also,  clinically, it has been suggested that high p70S6K activation in 
baseline Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) tumor samples  may predict a patient 
population more likely to derive benefit from mTOR inhibition.32

30 Everolimus  is a highly specific inhibitor of mTOR, which is afforded by high- affinity 
binding  to the protein FKBP -12 (IC 50 of 5.3 nM) similar to that of rapamycin. Similar 
potency of  rapamycin and everolimus  was also demonstrated at forming the mTOR/ 
FKBP- 12 tertiary  complex in vitro. Specificity was demonstrated by a lack of inhibitory 
activity against 10  other protein kinases at concentrations up to 10 μM.  
The anti -proliferative effects of everolimus were investigated in a mixed panel of 48 
different tumor cell lines (including breast, colon, epidermoid, glioblastoma, lung, 
melanoma, prostate and renal). The majority of tumor cell lines were highly sensitive 
to the anti -proliferative effects of everolimus while a few others appeared intrinsically 
insensitive, or ‘resistant’ (IC 50 range 0.2 to 4125 nM).33 The median IC 50 value of the 
48 cell lines was 0.5 nM. Similar findings have been observed for rapamycin.34 
Everolimus  was also shown to have activity in human pancreatic neuroendocrine 
cells,  where induction of apoptosis was reported,35 as well as in acute myeloid 
leukemia cells ,36 mantle cell lymphoma cells37, adult  T-cell leukemia cells38, diffuse 
large B cell lymphoma cells ,39 pancreatic tumor cells ,40 ovarian cancer cells ,31,41 and 
hepatocellular carcinoma cells .42 
Everolimus  was also evaluated in a clonogenic assay using cells derived fr om 81 
patient  derived tumor xenografts never cultured in vitro (11 human tumor types with 3 
to 24 tumors each: bladder, colon, gastric, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC) , 
Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC) , breast, ovary, pancreatic, renal, melanoma, and 
pleuramesothelioma). Everolimus  inhibited colony formation in a concentration-
dependent manner (mean IC 50: 175 nM). In addition, normal hematopoetic stem cells 
were found to be relatively insensitive to everolimus , with an IC 50 about 15 fold higher 
than the tum or lines. 
Everolimus was effective and well tolerated against subcutane ous (s.c.) tumors 
established from a variety of tumor cell lines of diverse histotypes (NSCLC, pancreatic, colon, melanoma, epidermoid), including a PgP170 -overexpressing, m ulti-
drug re sistant tumor line. Typically, the antitumor activity of everolimus was that of 
reduction of tumor growth rates rather than producing regressions or stable disease 
although, in the case of A549 and NCI -H596 lung and ARJ42 pancreatic tumors, 
regressions could be obtained. These effects occurred within the dose range of 2.5 to 
10 mg/kg, P.O., once per day. The change in tumor volume of the treated mice 
divided by the change in tumor volume of control mice (T/C) typically ranged from 
approximately 15 to 50% at  optimal doses. A marked loss of antitumor activity 
occurred when tumor -bearing mice were treated with everolimus once per week, but 
improved moderately with twice per week dosing. Antitumor activity of everolimus has also been demonstrated in mouse models  of ovarian,
31 breast ,43,44 and 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors .45 
1.4.2  Pre-Clinical S afety  
In safety pharmacology studies, everolimus was devoid of relevant effects on vital organ functions including the cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous systems. Everolimus had no effects on QT interval. Furthermore, everolimus showed no 
antigenic  potential. Although everolimus passes the blood- brain barrier, there was no 
indication of relevant changes in the behavior of rodents, even after single oral doses 
up to 2000 mg/kg or after repeated administration at up to 40 mg/kg/day.

31 The preclinical safety profile of everolimus was assessed in mice, rats, minipigs, 
monkeys, and rabbits. The major target organs were male and female repr oductive 
systems (testicular tubular degeneration, reduced sperm content in epididymides and uterine atrophy) in several species; lungs (increased alveolar macrophages) in rats and mice; and eyes (lenticular anterior suture line opacities) in rats only. Minor kidney 
changes were seen in the rat (exacerbation of age- related lipofuscin in tubular 
epithelium, increases in hydronephrosis) and mouse (exacerbation of background 
lesions). There was no indication of kidney toxicity in monkeys or minipigs.  
Genotoxic ity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence of 
clastogenic or mutagenic activity. Administration of everolimus for up to 2 years did not indicate any oncogenic potential in mice and rats up to the highest doses, 
corresponding respectively to 4.2 and 0.2 times the estimated clinical exposure. In 
reproduction studies, everolimus was toxic to the conceptus in rats and rabbits, and was considered potentially teratogenic in rats. It is therefore recommended that 
women of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive measures during 
the entire treatment period and for 8 weeks thereafter.

1.4.3  Clinical E xperience 
1.4.3.1  Everolimus  Pharmacokinetics  
Everolimus is rapidly absorbed with a median t max of 1- 2 hours. The steady -state 
AUC 0-τ is dose- proportional over the dose range between 5 to 70 mg in the weekly 
regimen and 5 and 10 mg in the daily regimen. Steady -state was achieved within two 
weeks with the daily dosing regimen. C max is dose- proportional between 5 and 10 mg 
for both the weekly and daily regimens. At doses of 20 mg/week and higher, the 
increase in C max is less than dose proportional. In healthy subjects, high fat meals 
reduced systemic exposure to everolimus 10 mg (as measured by Area Under the 
Concentration Time -Curve ( AUC) ) by 22% and the peak plasma concentration C max 
by 54%. Light fat meals reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Food, however, had 
no apparent effect on the post absorption phase concentration- time profile.  
The blood -to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration- dependent over the 
range of 5 to 5,000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the 
plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients 
given everolimus 10 mg/day. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and a substrate and moderate inhibitor of PgP. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood and is considered to contribute the majority of the overall pharmacologic 
activity. No specific excretion studies have been undertaken in cancer patients; 
however, data available from the transplantation setting found the drug to be mainl y 
eliminated through the feces. There was a significant correlation between AUC
0-τ and 
pre-dose trough concentration at steady -state on the daily regimen. The mean 
elimination half -life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours.

1.4.3.2  Everolimus  Pharmacodynamic Studies  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynami c modeling based on inhibition of the biomarker 
p70S6 kinase 1 [S6K1] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]) suggests that 
5-10 mg daily should be an adequate dose to produce a high- degree of sustained 
target inhibition ([Study C2101]/[Study 2102]).46 Molecular changes in tumor were 
evaluated through serial biopsy  before and during treatment. Biopsy  on treatment 
took place in week 4 (pharmacokinetic steady -state). All patients underwent a 24-
hour post -dose biopsy. Patients following the weekly regimen had a further biopsy on 
Day 4 or 5 of the same week. Molecular activity was measured by immunohistochemistry. In the absence of a reliable technique for measuring mTOR phosphorylation, the phosphorylation status of downstream markers S6 and eIF4G, 
for wh ich reliable antibodies exist, was selected as reflecting the immediate 
pharmacodynamic effect of everolimus. Also measured were changes in the 
phosphorylation status of upstream AKT and the proliferation index Ki67. Fifty -five 
patients were treated and the results revealed a dose and schedule dependent inhibition of the mTOR pathway with a near complete inhibition of pS6 and pelF- 4G at 
the 10 mg/day and 50 mg/wk schedules. In addition, pAKT was upregulated in 50% of 
the treated tumors. In the daily schedul e, there was a correlation between everolimus 
plasma trough concentrations and inhibition of peIF4G and p4E -BP1. There was 
good concordance of mTOR pathway inhibition between skin and tumor. [Study 
C2107].

1.4.3.3  Clinical E xperience with Everolimus  
Everolimus has been in clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation and was approved in Europe in 2003 under the trade 
name Certi can
®, for the prevention of organ rejection in patients with renal and 
cardiac transplantation. It is also approved in the United States (trade name: Zortress®) for the prevention of organ rejection of kidney transplantation.  Additional 
non-oncologic indications currently being explored are wet age- related macular 
degeneration (AMD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Clinical experience of everolimus in the transplant indication is summarized in a separate Investigator’s Brochure.  
In oncology, everolimus has been in clinical development since 2002 for patients with 
various hematologic and non- hematologic malignancies as a single agent or in 
combination with antitumor agents. Please note that safety pharmacology and 
toxicology studies as well as some human pharmacology studies which have been conducted in support of the transplant indication, are described in the oncology IB due to the relevance of these data for the oncology indication. Malignancies that are 
currently being evaluated in Novartis sponsored studies include the following:

neuroendocrine tumors (GEP -NET), mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), gastric cancer, and lung cancer. In addition, treatment of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and Angiomyolypoma is also being 
evaluated.  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is no longer being evaluated.  
Everolimus 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg tablets were approved under the trade name 
Afinitor
® for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in the US, EU and several 
other countries and is undergoing registration in other regions worldwide.  Recent 
approval was  granted in the US for the treatment of patients with subependymal giant 
cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) who require therapeutic intervention but are not candidates for curative surgical resection.  
Phase I dose escalating studies, exploratory Phase I/II studies with everolimus as 
single agent  or in combination with other anti -cancer agents, Phase II/III studies of 
everolimus in indications, and Phase III double- blind studies are contributing to the 
extensive database.  
Approxi mately 18,730 cancer patients have been treated with everolimus as of 30-
Sep-2011:  
• 9,528 patients in Novartis -sponsored clinical trials  
• 2,559 patients in the individual patient supply program  
• 6,638 in investigator -sponsored studies.  
• In addition, healthy volunteer subjects have participated in the clinical 
pharmacology studies as described in Section 1.4.3.1 . 
As of 3 0-Sep-2011 , there are a total of 11 Phase III trials ongoing in the indications 
mRCC (1), advanced NET (2), breast cancer ( 3), TSC (2), DLBCL (1 ), gastric cancer 
(1) and HCC (1) . 
Recent approvals of everolimus (Afinitor
®) were based upon a Phase III, international, 
multicenter randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study [C2240] in patients 
with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) whose disease had progressed despite 
prior treatment with VEGFR -TKI (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor) therapy. Progression- free survival (PFS) assessed via a blinded, 
independent central review, was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included safety and  objective tumor response. 
In the pivotal, Phase III study [C2240], which included patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥  10%) were 
stomatitis, rash, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, mucosal inflammation, vomiting, pneumonitis, cough, peripheral edema, infections, dry skin, epistaxis, 
pruritus, and dyspnea. The most common grade 3- 4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥  
2%) were infections, stomatitis, fatigue, and pneumonitis. Non -infectious pneumonitis 
is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus and some of these cases have been severe and on rare occasions, fatal outcomes have been observed. 
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to 
bacterial, fungal, viral or protozoan infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens. Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia,  other bacterial 
infections, invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or candidiasis and viral

34 infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients 
taking everolimus. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. leading to 
respiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally have had a fatal outcome. 
The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence ≥  50%) were anemia, 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and 
increased creatinine. The most common grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities 
(incidence ≥  3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and 
hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection 
(0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) wer e observed on the everolimus arm. The 
rates of treatment -emergent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation 
were 7% and 0% for the everolimus and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Safety data from study [C2240] are described in detail in Section 1.4.3.3.  
Overall, safety data available from completed, controlled and uncontrolled studies are 
consistent with the aforementioned findings of the Phase III trial. Everolimus is 
generally well tolerated at weekly and daily dose schedules. The sa fety profile is 
characterized by manageable adverse events (AEs). These AEs are generally 
reversible and non- cumulative.  
Further detailed information regarding everolimus  clinical development, safety and 
efficacy is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4.3.4  
Clinical Experience with Everolimus in Metastatic Breast Cancer 
Resistant to Non -Steroidal Aromatase Inhibitors  
Based on data indicating that resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer is 
associated with activation of the mammalian target of rapamyc in (mTOR) intracellular 
signaling pathway , a Phase 3, randomized trial (BOLERO2) compared the steroidal 
aromatase inhibitor exemestane (25 mg PO daily) plus either everolimus (10 mg PO 
daily) or a placebo (randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio) in 724 patients with HR-positive 
advanced breast cancer who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting or to treat 
advanced disease (or both). The primary end point was progression- free survival. 
Secondary end points included survival, response rate, and safety. A preplanned 
interim analysis was performed by an independent data and safety monitoring 
committee after 359 progression- free survival events were observed.  Baseline 
characteristics were well balanced between the two study groups. The median age 
was 62 years, 56% had visceral involvement, and 84% had hormone- sensitive 
disease. Previous therapy included letrozole or anastrozole (100%), tamoxifen (48%), 
fulvestrant (16%), and chemotherapy (68%). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were stomatitis (8% in the everolimus -plus-exemestane group vs. 1% in the 
placebo- plus-exemestane group), anemia (6% vs. <1%), dyspnea (4% vs. 1%), 
hyperglycemia (4% vs. <1%), fatigue (4% vs. 1%), and pneumonitis (3% vs. 0%). At the interim analysis, median progression-free survival was 6.9 months with 
everolimus plus exemestane and 2.8 months with placebo plus e xemestane, 
according to assessments by local investigators (hazard ratio for progression or 
death, 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.54; P<0.001). Median 
progression- free survival was 10.6 months and 4.1 months, respectively, according to 
central assessment (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.47; P<0.001).  The study 
met its pre -specified endpoint, which led to FDA approval of everolimus in

35 combination with exemestane for this indication in the U.S. on July 20, 2012.48  
Overall survival results were immature at the time of the interim analy sis, with a total 
of 83 deaths: 10.7% of patients in the combination- therapy group and 13.0% of those 
in the exemestane- alone group died. Patients and investigators continue to be 
unaware of study assignments and will remain so until  survival re sults are mature for 
analysis.49  
1.5 Rationale and Study D esign  
We hypothesize more complete blockade of the ER -signaling pathway may be 
achieved with selective estrogen receptor downregulator fulvestrant (given at a high 
dose) than may be achieved with the steroidal AI exemestane, and that this will result 
in either comparable or greater effectivene ss for the fulvestrant -everolimus 
combination than the exemestane- everolimus combination. This is supported by 
preclinical data demons trating that fulvestrant is particularly effective when combined 
with agents targeti ng the PI3K -AKT-m-TOR pathway in tumors that have undergone 
long-term estrogen deprivation, as is the case for patients who have acquired 
resistance to AI  therapy.50 
We therefore propose to study the efficacy of fulvestrant in combination with 
everolimus  for the treatment of post -menopausal HR-positive metastatic breast 
cancer in women who have progressed after treatment with an aromatase inhibitor. The combination of a novel class of agents ( mTOR  inhibitors) and an established 
standard treatment for metast atic HR- positive  breast cancer may  potentially increase 
the clinical benefit by targeting multiple different biological pathways.  
This is a randomized, double- blind , placebo controlled Phase II study . It is expected 
that 130 patients will be accrued at 25 centers within the US. Patients will be 
randomized ( 1:1) to receive everolimus  or placebo after consideration of stratification 
factors of performance status ( 0 vs.1 ), measurable disease (with or without non-
measurable) vs. non- measurable disease,  and prior chemotherapy for metastatic 
disease vs. no prior chemotherapy.  
Induction Phase:  
Treatment  during the Induction Phase includes:  
Fulvestrant 500 mg IM (two- 250 mg injections per dose) on day 1 & 15 of C ycle 1,  
then 500 mg IM (two- 250 mg injections)  on day 1 of all subsequent cycles (every 28 
days) plus everolimus 10 mg ( two- 5 mg tablets ) PO daily  
OR 
Fulvestrant 500 mg IM (two- 250 mg injections per dose) on day 1 & 15 of C ycle 1,  
then 500 mg IM (two- 250 mg injections)  on day 1 of all subsequent cycles (ever y 28 
days)  plus placebo two tablets PO daily  
Patients will be evaluated for disease response every 12 weeks  (every 3 treatment 
cycles), +/- 1 week, and treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity  or for 
a total of up to 12 cycles.

Date: 1/22/2014 
36 Continuati on Phase:  
Patients with no evidence of progressive disease who remain on study aft er 
completing Cycle 12 will be  unblinded and proceed to the Continuation Phase. 
Patients in the Continuation Phase should continue to receive fulvestrant alone (if 
originally  randomized to placebo) or in combination with everolimus (if originally 
randomized to everolimus) at the same dose and schedule. Patients will continue to 
be evaluated for disease response every 12 weeks (every 3 treatment cycles), +/ - 1 
week, and may continue t reatment  until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . 
All patients will be followed for 30 days for toxicity after the last dose of study therapy  
(fulvestrant and/or  everolimus/placebo)  or until recovery from all toxicity  (to ≤ grade 1)  
attributed to study therapy, whichever is longer  (or if > grade 1, event must be 
permanent and stable) .

4.1 Ethics  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin in the current Declaration of Helsinki and will be consistent with applicable US 
regulatory requirements and International Conference on Harmonization Good 
Clinical Practice (ICH GCP).  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any 
amendments and the patient informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) approval prior to initiation of the study.  
Freely given written informed consent must be obtained from every patient or their 
legally acceptable representative prior to clinical trial participation, including informed 
consent for any screening procedures conducted to establish pat ient eligibility for the 
trial. 
Study personnel involved in conducting this trial will be qualified by education, training,  and experience to perform their respective task(s). This trial will not use the 
services of investigators or study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or 
where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, 
debarment). Investigators are responsible for the conduct of the study at their study site. 
4.2 Regulatory Requirements  
Before a site may enter patients, protocol -specific regulatory and other documents 
must be submitted to PrECOG as noted in study materials. Detailed information regarding document submission and control is provided to each site in separate study 
materials. 
Once all required documents are received, reviewed and approved by PrECOG or 
their representative, a Study Reference Manual (SRM)  will be forwarded to the site. 
Any changes to site regulatory documents must be submitted by the investigator to the responsible party in a timely manner. Initial study drug shipment will not occur until the regulatory packet is complete. No patients will begin protocol t herapy without  
formal randomization as per the process below.

44 5 Treatment Plan  
5.1 Administration Schedule  
Note : 1 cycle = 28 days.  
Patients must begin treatment within 7 working days of randomization.  
Disea se evaluations will occur after every 12 weeks, + /- 1 week  (which corresponds 
to every 3 treatment cycles) and patients will be treated until disease progression , 
unacceptable toxicity  or for a total duration of 12 cycles (Induction Phase). Patients 
with n o evidence of progressive disease who remain on study after completing 12 
cycles will be  unblinded and proceed to the Continuation Phase. Patients in the 
Continuation Phase should continue to receive fulvestrant alone (if originally 
randomized to placebo) or in combination with everolimus (if originally randomized to 
everolimus) at the same dose and schedule. Disease evaluations will continue to 
occur after every 12 weeks  (every 3 treatment cycles) , +/- 1 week, and patients may 
continue treatment  until dise ase progression is documented or unacceptable toxicity . 
All patients will be followed for 30 days for toxicity after the last dose of study therapy (fulvestrant and/or  everolimus/placebo) or until recovery from all toxicity (to ≤ grade 1) 
attributed to study therapy, whichever is longer (or if >grade 1, event must be permanent and stable) . 
See Sections 8.1 and  8.2 for information on study drug procurement, storage, 
preparation, handling and destruction information.  
5.2 Dosing and Administration 
5.2.1  Fulvestrant (Arm  A and Arm B)  
Induction Phase:  
Cycle 1 (28 day cycle)  
Patients will receive fulvestrant 500 mg IM (two- 250 mg injections each dose) 
on day 1 and 15.  
Note:  Cycle 1 is the only time fulvestrant is given on day 15 . If patient 
previously received one cycle of fulvestrant (day 1 and day 15)  prior to study 
entry as permitted in Inclusion Criteria #8, patient should receive fulvestrant 500 
mg on day 1 only.  
Cycle 2,  and thereafter (28 day cycles)  
Patients will receive fulvestrant 500 mg IM (two-250 mg injections) on day 1 of 
all subsequent  cycles for a maximum of 12 cycles.  
Continuation Phase:  
Patients with no evidence of disease progression after completing 12 cycles are unblinded and continue f ulvestrant  alone (if originally randomized to placebo) or in 
combinati on with everolimus (if originally randomized to everolimus) at the same dose 
and schedule until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity .

5.2.2  Everolimus  or Placebo (Arm A and Arm B) 
• The study drug everolimus /placebo will be self -administered (by the patients 
themselves). The local i nvestigator will instruct the patient to take the study drug 
exactly as specified in the protocol. Everolimus /placebo should be administered 
orally once daily, preferably in the morning, at the same time every day with or 
without food. Everolimus /placebo tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass 
of water. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. In  cases where tablets 
cannot be swallowed, the tablets should be disintegrated in water just prior to 
being taken. Approximately 30 mL (2 tablespoons)  of water should be put into a 
glass. The tablets  should then be added and the contents stirred gently (for a 
maximum of 7 minutes) until the tablets are disintegrated. The contents should 
then be drunk. If the patient  vomit s after taking the  study drug, they  should not 
take another tablet that day. If the patient forgets to take the medication and 
remember s by 10 PM, they  may take the dose. Otherwise,  skip that dose and 
begin as usual the next day.  
• Everolimus/placebo will be administered orally as once daily dose of 10 mg (two - 
5 mg tablets)  continuously from study day 1 until progression of disease or 
unacceptable toxicity  for 12 cycles.  See Section 5.5 regarding duration of therapy 
(including guidelines for treatment beyond Cycle 12).  
• If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose.  
• All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes during 
the study must be recorded.  
• PrECOG , or their designee, will be responsible for blinding, drug randomization, 
and management of the electronic interactive web registration (IWR) system. Both 
tablets will be blinded and identified by kit number only. The I WR system will 
assign the proper kit to the patient based on the patient randomization. Conditions 
for study drug will be described on the medication label.  
• Both everolimus and placebo will be provided by Novartis. Everolimus is 
formulated as tablets for oral administration of 5 mg st rength. Both placebo and 
everolimus tablets are blister- packed under aluminum foil in units of 10 tablets per 
blister card, which should be opened only at the time of administration as drug is both hygroscopic and light -sensitive.  
• Dose modifications should be made prior to dose calculation at the beginning of 
each cycle and reasons recorded in source documents and on appropriate case 
report forms.

Placebo  
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade : The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE Ver sion 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 
can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTEP CTCAE 
Version 4.0. (see Appendix E).  
Dose modifications for all drugs will be made using the general guidelines below.  
• All dose reductions are permanent. Fulvestrant will not be dose reduced.  
• Regardless of the reason for holding any study drug treatment, the maximum 
allowable length of treatment interruption is ≤  3 weeks. If the delivery of any study 
drug due to toxicity is delayed for more than 3 weeks, that drug should be 
permanently discontinued. 
• No more than 2 dose reductions for everolimus/placebo will be allowed. Further 
need for dose reduction will result in discont inuation of that drug.  
• If dose is delayed due to toxicity, labs/toxicity should be reevaluated at least 
weekly until recovery  to treatment levels, or as indicated in the dos e modification 
tables.  
• Patients who discontinue everolimus/placebo because of suspected everolimus -
associated toxicity should continue treatment with fulvestrant alone until disease 
progression.  
• In unusual circumstances where fulvestrant must be discontinued prior to disease 
progression due to intolerable fulvestrant -associated toxicity, the Medical Monitor 
should be contacted.

5.3.2  Common Adverse Events Associated with Everolimus  
The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus (n=274) and placebo 
(n=137) in a randomized Phase III study for the treatment of metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma. In total, 165 patients were exposed to everolimus 10 mg/day for ≥  4 
months. The median age of patients was 61 years (range 27 to 85). The most 
common adverse reactions (incidence ≥  10%) were stomatitis, rash, fatigue, asthenia, 
diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, mucosal inflammation, vomiting, cough, peripheral edema, infections, dry skin,  epistaxis, pruritus, and dyspnea. The most common 
grade 3- 4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥  2%) were infections, stomatitis, fatigue, and 
pneumonitis.  
The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (range 19 to 451) for 
patients receiving everolimus and 60 days (range 21 to 295) for those receiving 
placebo. The rates of treatment -emergent adverse reactions resulting in permanent 
discontinuation were 7% and 0% for the everolimus and placebo treatment groups, 
respectively. Most treatment -emergent adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 in 
severity. Grade 3 or 4 treatment -emergent adverse reactions were reported in 39% 
versus 7% of patients receiving everolimus and placebo, respectively. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were 
observed on the everolimus arm. 
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to 
bacterial, fungal, viral or protozoan infections, including infections with opportunistic 
pathogens. Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or candidiasis and viral 
infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients 
taking everolimus. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. leading to respiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally have had a fatal outcome.  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/2014 
50 Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with 
everolimus. Treat pre -existing infe ctions prior to starting treatment with everolimus. 
While taking everolimus, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of everolimus. If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is 
made, discontinue everolimus and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy.  
Reactivation of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer 
receiving chemotherapy .
53 Sporadic cases  of Hepatitis B reactivation have also been 
seen in this setting with everolimus. Use of antivirals during anti -cancer therapy has 
been shown to reduce the risk of Hepatitis B virus reactivation and associated 
morbidity and mortality.54 A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and 
risk factors must be done for all patients at screening, with testing performed prior t o 
the first dose of everolimus.  
Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, 
anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the 
airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) have been observed with everolimus.  
Elevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, have been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of  renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or 
serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and 
periodically thereafter.  
Decreased hemoglobin, lymphocytes, platelets and neutrophils have been reported in 
clinical trials. Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of 
everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter.  
The use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live 
vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus.  
Hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyponatremia and hypocalcaemia have been reported as serious adverse reactions. Electrolytes should be monitored in patients treated with everolimus.  
Table 5- 1 and Table 5- 2 provide general recommendat ions for the management of 
patients, with suspected drug toxicities while on treatment with everolimus as single-agent therapy.  
More detailed information regarding everolimus reported suspected toxicities and individual cases are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.3.2.1  
Management of Hepatitis Reactivation /Flare  
In cancer patients with hepatitis B, whether carriers or in chronic state, use of

5.3.2.3  Monitoring for Hepatitis C  Flare  
The following two categories of patients should be monitored every 4-8 weeks for 
HCV reactivation:  
• Patients with detectable HCV RNA -PCR test at baseline.

Version 4.0 Metabolic Laboratory/Other: Viral Flare). 
5.3.2.4  Management of Skin Toxicity  
For patients with grade 1 toxicity, no specific supportive care is usually needed or 
indicated. Rash must be reported as an AE. Patients with grade 2 or higher toxicity may be treated with the following suggested supportive measures at the discretion of 
the investigator: oral minocycline, topical tetracycline, topical clindamycin, topical 
silver sulfadiazine, diphenhydramine, oral prednisolone (short course), topical corticosteroids, or pimecrolimus.

54 5.3.2.5  Management of Stomatitis/ Oral Mucositis/ Mouth Ulcers  
Patients with a clinical history of stomatitis/mucositis/mouth ulcers and those with 
gastrointestinal morbidity associated with mouth/dental infections, irritation of 
esophageal mucosa e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and pre- existing 
stomatitis/mucositis must be monitored even more closely. Patients should be 
instructed to report the first onset of buccal mucosa irritation/reddening to their study 
physician immediately.  
Suggested prophylactic treatment for prevention of stomatitis/mucositis:  
a) Use 15 mL baking soda/salt mouth rinse QID (swish and spit).  Mix 1/3 t easp oon 
baking soda and 1/3 t easpoon of salt in 1 quart of water (refrigeration is not 
needed); do not eat or drink anything for 10 minutes  after rinsing . 
b) Use 10 mL prescribed “miracle mouth wash’’ QID (swish and spit). For 16- ounce 
recipe: 320 mL Benadryl solution, 2 g tetracycline powder, 80 mg hydrocortisone , 
and 40 mL nystatin suspension, quantity sufficient with water. Wait 10 -15 minutes 
after the baking soda/salt rinse before using “miracle mouthwash’’ .55 
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to everol imus  should be treated using local 
supportive care. Please note that investigators in earlier trials have described the oral 
toxicities associated with everolimus  as mouth ulcers, rather than mucositis or 
stomatitis. If your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than a more general inflammation of the mouth, please classify the adverse event as such. Please follow the paradigm below for treatment of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers:  
1. For mild toxicity (Grade 1), use conservative me asures as noted above, baking 
soda/salt mouth rinse and “miracle mouth wash”.  
2. For more severe toxicity (Grade 2 in which case patients have pain but are able to 
maintain adequate oral alimentation, or Grade 3 in which case patients cannot 
maintain adequate oral alimentation), the suggested treatments are:  
In addition to baking soda/salt mouth rinse and “miracle mouth wash” above,  topical analgesic mouth treatments (e.g., local anesthetics such as 
benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) 
with or without topical corticosteroids,  such as triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% 
(Kenalog in Orabase
®) or Periogard® oral rinse. 
3. Agents containing hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to 
worsen mouth ulcers. It is preferable to avoid these agents.  Alcohol –containing 
rinses and tooth paste with sodium lauryl sulfate should also be avoided. Avoid 
acidic, spicy, hard, or crunchy foods, and consume foods that are tepid rather 
than hot .55 
4. Antifungal agents must be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In 
particular, systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, 
itraconazole, etc.) should be avoided in all patients due to their strong inhibition of everolimus  metabolism, thereby leading to higher everolimus  exposures. 
Therefore, topical antifungal agents are preferred if an infection is diagnosed. Similarly, antiviral agents such as acyclovir should be avoided unless a viral 
infection is diagnosed.  
Note:  Stomatitis/oral mucositis should be appropriately graded using the functional 
grading given on the CTEP CTCAE Version 4.0.

55 5.3.2.6  Management of Diarrhea  
Appearance of grade 1- 2 diarrhea attributed to study drug toxicity may be treated with 
supportive care such as loperamide, initiated at the earliest onset (for example 4 mg 
orally followed by 2 mg orally every 2 hours until resolution of diarrhea).  
5.3.2.7  Management of Hyperlipidemia and Hyperglycemia  
Treatment of hy perlipidemia should take into account the pre -treatment status and 
dietary habits. Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L) or grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia or higher (>2.5x upper normal limit) should be treated 
with a 3 -hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase inhibitor (e.g. atorvastatin, 
pravastatin, fluvastatin) or appropriate triglyceride- lowering medication, in addition to 
diet. 
Note:  Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is 
associated with an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity 
manifested by rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
levels and myoglobinuria, acute renal failure and sometimes death. The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be determined for individual patients based on 
their risk of cardiovascular complications of hyperlipidemia.  
Hyperglycemia has been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of fasting serum 
glucose is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically 
thereafter. Optimal glycemic control should be achieved before starting trial therapy . 
5.3.2.8  
Management of Non-Infectious Pneumonitis  
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Cases of non-
infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) have also been described in patients taking everolimus . Some of these have been severe and on rare occasions , 
a fatal outcome was observed.   
A diagnosis of non- infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients 
presenting with non- specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural 
effusion, cough or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-
medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. 
Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory 
symptoms.  
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non- infectious pneumonitis 
and have few or no symptoms may continue everolimus therapy without dose 
alteration. If symptoms are mode rate (Grade 2), consideration should be given to 
interruption of therapy until symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids may be 
indicated. Everolimus may be reintroduced at a reduced dose until recovery to Grade 
1 or better.  
For cases where symptoms of non-infectious pneumonitis are severe (Grade 3), 
everolimus therapy should be discontinued and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Therapy with everolimus may be re- initiated 
at a reduced dose depending on the individual clinical circumstances.

5.3.4  Prohibited Therapies and Restrictions  
The following restrictions apply during the entire duration of the study:  
• No other investigational therapy should be given to patients.  
• No anticancer agents other than the study medication should be given to patients , 
with the following exceptions:  
o Bisphosphonates , Zometa, or Xgeva  for bone metastases  
o a GnRH analog is permitted if the patient had progressive disease on a GnRH 
analog plus a SERM or an AI; the GnRH analog may continue but the S ERM 
or AI must be discontinued. 
• If any other anticancer agents are required for a patient then the patient must first 
be withdrawn from the  study.  
• Concurrent  radiation therapy  is prohibited, however  palliative radiotherapy may be 
considered on a case by case basis after discussion with the Study  Chair . 
• Patients must not be receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or 
another immunosuppressive agent  greater than or equal to 5 mg prednisone or its 
equivalent daily. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allow ed. 
• The use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live 
vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples of live 
vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, 
yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.  
• It is highly recommended that patients  with positive HBV -DNA or HBsAg are 
treated prophylactically with an antiviral for 1 -2 weeks prior to receiving study drug 
(see Table 5 -3). 
• The antiviral treatment should continue throughout the entire study period and for 
at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  
• Patients on antiviral prophylaxis treatment or positive HBV antibodies should be tested for HBV -DNA  according to study visit schedule.  
• Oral contraceptives in preclinical and clinical data have shown everolimus to have CYP3A4 inhibitory activity rather than induction activity, induction of metabolism 
of contraceptive hormones by everolimus is unlikely. Consequently, administration of everolimus should not reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.  
• Grapefruit and other  citrus  juices affect P450 and PgP activity. Concomitant use 
should be avoided.

58 5.3.5  Administration of Everolimus and CYP3A4 Inhibitors/  
Inducers  
5.3.5.1  Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or PgP  
Everolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal 
wall. 
Therefore, the following are recommended:  
Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
ritonavir) or P -glycoprotein (PgP) should be avoided.  
Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole) 
or PgP inhibitors should be used with caution. If a patient requires co -administration 
of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP inhibitors, reduce the dose of everolimus t o 5 
mg every other day. Additional dose reductions to every other day may be required to 
manage toxicities. If the inhibitor is discont inued, the everolimus dose should be 
returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor  
after a washout period of 2- 3 days . 
Grapefruit  and other  citrus  juices affect P450 and PgP activity. Concomitant use 
should be avoided.  
Refer to Appendix C Table 15-0 for list of medications known to induce/ inhibit 
CYP3A4  and Table 15-1 for a list of medications known to inhibit PgP . 
5.3.5.2  Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or PgP  
Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 inducers  (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifa mpin, 
rifabutin, phenobarbital, St. John’s W ort). If a patient requires co -administration of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers, an increase in the dose of everolimus up to twice the 
currently used daily dose should be considered, 5 mg increments. Enzyme induction 
usually occurs within 7- 10 days; therefore everolimus dose should be increased by 
one increment 7 days after the start of the inducer therapy. If no safety concerns are seen within the next 7 days, the dose can be increased again one additional 
increment up to a maximum of twice the daily dose used prior to initiation of the 
strong CYP3A4 inducer. The choice to adjust the dose of everolimus  in a patient 
requiring co -administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers  will be done at the discretion 
of the treating investigator.  
This dose adjustment of everolimus is intended to achieve similar AUC to the range observed without inducers. However, there are no clinical data with this dose 
adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the strong inducer is 
discontinued the everolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer. Refer to Appendix C Table 15-0 for list 
of medications known to induce CYP3A4 and Table 15-1 for a list of medications 
known to induce PgP . 
Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are CYP2C9 substrates and, as such, no 
interaction with everolimus is expected. However, drug -drug interaction studies 
between macrolide antibiotics and warfarin have produced mixed outcomes and the 
disparity in these findings has led to the conclusion that multiple factors may alter the 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102

59 clearance of warfarin. The co- administration of everolimus and oral anticoagulants is 
possible but should be subject to verification of coagulation (INR) once steady state is 
reached (a fter one week’s treatment).  
A comprehensive list of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and CYP3A4 inhibitors, 
inducers, and substrates can be found at : 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx . This website is continually 
revised and should be checked frequently for updates.  
5.4 Supportive Care  
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will  be given throughout 
the study.  
The clinical tolerance of the patient, the overall tumor response, and the medical judgment of the investigator will determine if it is in the patient’s best interest to 
continue or discontinue treatment.  If treatment is discontinued due to any toxicity, the 
patient must be followed to monitor duration of toxicity, response and time to 
progression or survival and initiation of any new systemic therapy.  
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
CR, PR, or SD patients will continue therapy  per their induction arm randomized 
assignments until evidence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity  occurs, or 
for a total of 12 cycles (Induction Phase) . Pat ients with no evidence of progressive 
disease who remain on study after completing 12 cycles  will be unblinded and 
proceed to the Continuation Phase. Patients in the Continuation Phase should 
continue to receive fulvestrant alone (if originally randomized to placebo) or in 
combination with everolimus (if originally randomized to everolimus) at the same dose 
and schedule until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .  
Protocol therapy will be discontinued for progressive disease at any time. Patients are 
free to halt therapy at their request.  Treatment may be discontinued if intercurrent co-
morbidities occur, which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would preclude safe administration of study drugs.  
Patients who discontinue everolimus/placebo because of suspected everolimus -
associated toxicity should continue treatment with fulvestrant alone until disease 
progression. In unusual circumstances where fulvestrant must be discontinued prior 
to disease progression due to intolerable fulvestrant -associated toxicity, the medical 
monitor should be contacted. All patients who have discontinued protocol therapy will 
be followed for survival and for progression if protocol therapy was discontinued 
because of toxicity or for other reasons. All surviving p atients who have discontinued 
induction protocol therapy  (fulvestrant and everolimus/placebo) for any reason will  be 
followed for  30 days for study drug related (fulvestrant and/or everolimus/placebo)  
toxicities to ≤ grade 1  (or if >grade 1, event must be permanent and stable) .

60 5.6 Withdrawal of Patients from Study  
Patients MUST be discontinued from study therapy AND be withdrawn from the study 
for the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of the patient ’s conse nt (patient’s decision to withdraw for any reason)  
• Termination of the study by PrECOG  
• Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in 
the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is 
not in the best interest of the subject  
• Inability to comply with protocol  
• Discretion of the investigator  
• Disease progression (patient will continued to be followed for survival)  
All subjects who discontinue treatment should comply with protocol specified follow -
up procedures as outlined in Section 7. 1.5. 
If a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal must be entered on the appropriate case report form.

61 6 Measurement of E ffect  
6.1 Antitumor Effect- Solid Tumors  
For the purposes  of this study, patients should be re- evaluated for response every 12 
weeks , +/- 1 week. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than four weeks before 
randomization.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) guideline (V ersion 1.1) .56 Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumo r lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant 
lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
6.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with fulvestrant and everolimus /placebo. All patients will be followed for 
30 days for toxicity after the last dose of study therapy (fulvestrant and/or  
everolimus/placebo) or until recovery from all toxicity (to ≤ grade 1) attributed to study 
therapy, whichever is longer (or if >grade 1, event must be permanent and stable) . 
Evaluable for objective response : Only those patients who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will 
have their response classified according to  the definitions stated below. ( Note:  
Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of C ycle 1 will also 
be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable non-target disease response : Patients who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for non -target disease. The response assessment is 
based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
6.1.2  Disease Parameters  
Measurable lesions : are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement) is to be recorded with 
a minimum size of: 
• ≥ 20 mm by chest x -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung)  
• ≥ 10 mm with CT scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than 
double the slice thickness and a minim um of 10 mm)  
• ≥ 10 mm w ith calipers by clinical exam  when superficial  
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/2014 
62 Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area 
subjected to other loco -regional therapy,  are usually not considered measurable  
unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. 
Malignant lymph nodes : to be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis  (perpendicular to longest diameter) when 
assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 
mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable lesions : all other lesions (or s ites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease. Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast 
disease, and abdominal masses /organomegaly  (not followed by CT or MRI), are 
considered as non- measurable. 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -
measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However , if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for 
selection as target lesions.  
Lytic bone lesions, with an identifiable soft tissue component, evaluated by CT or MRI, can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component otherwise 
meets the definition of measurability noted above. Blastic bone lesions are non-
measurable.  
6.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers. All ba seline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before randomization. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the 
lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be co nsidered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers  (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate  the size  of the 
lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  
 
 
 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/2014 
63 Conventional CT and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans 
have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. 
for body scans).  
Use o f MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion  conspicuity, and measurement. 
Furthermore, the availabilit y of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is 
performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of  the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, 
the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence 
parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of 
scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for  use with RECIST 
measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
Ultrasound : Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced 
in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will 
be taken fr om one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound 
in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern 
about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected 
instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is 
an endpoint.  
Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response. Specific guidelines for both CA -125 
response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published.
57-59 In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has 
developed CA -125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective 
tumor assessment for use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer .60 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/2014 
64 Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in 
tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease 
(an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it i s 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement 
CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New 
lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorit hm: 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  
o If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of diseas e 
confirmed b y CT, this is PD.  
o If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of th e 
initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  
o If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, 
this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to r epresent 
fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease- specific medical 
literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
6.1.4  Response Criteria  
6.1.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and five lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis 
of their size (those with the longest diameters), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend 
itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/2014 
65 The sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) 
for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If 
lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the 
sum. The baseline sum of the diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
Complete Response (CR) : Disapp earance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters . 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm  over the 
nadir . (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study . (Note:  a change of 20% or more that does not increase the sum of the 
diameters by 5 mm or more is coded as stable disease).  
6.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
All other lesions or sites of disease including any measurable lesions over and above 
the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normal ization 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis) . 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits . 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, n ot a si ngle lesion increase. 
When the patient also has measurable disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficie ntly to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. A modest “increase” in the size of one or more non- target 
lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/2014 
66 designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non- target disease 
in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the patient only has non- measurable disease, the increase in overall disease 
burden should be comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to  
declare PD for measurable disease: i.e., an increase in tumor burden from “trace” to 
“large”, an increase in nodal disease from “localized” to “widespread”, or an increase 
sufficient to require a change in therapy.  
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of 
the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
6.1.4.3  
Evaluation of New Lesions  
The appearance of new lesions constitutes Progressive Disease (PD).  
6.1.4.4  Evaluation of Patient’s Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

68 6.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the 
first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as 
reference for PD  the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatmen t 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
6.1.6  Progression- Free Survival  
PFS is defined as the duration of time from time of randomizati on to time of 
progression or death, whichever occurs first.  A subject who has neither progressed 
nor died will be censored on the date of last tumor  assessment.

PCR testing performed on ≤ 7 days prior to the start of C1D1 and +/- 72 hrs prior to D1 of each subsequent cycle to monitor for flare. Everolimus must be 
discontinued if HCV flare is confirmed according to the guidance in Table 5-5. 
i: Tumor measurements may be made using physical examination, CT Scans or MRI. Tumor assessments will be performed every 12 weeks, +/ - 1 week 
(every 3 months). Imaging will include chest and abdomen. Bone Scans and Brain CT/MRI may be performed as clinically indicated. Scans do not have to be 
repeated once disease progression is documented.  
j: Adverse events related to fulvestrant and/or everolimus/placebo will be followed for 30 days after the last dose of study therapy (fulvestrant and/or 
everolimus/placebo) or until ≤ grade 1 or if the grade is >1, the event must be permanent and stable. Please note- S erious adverse events >30 days after last 
dose of fulvestrant and/or  everolimus/placebo are not reported unless the event may be related to everolimus/placebo.

78 8 Drug Formulation and P rocurement  
8.1 Everolimus  
8.1.1  Packaging and Labeling 
Full instructions for investigator sites and investigational pharmacies will be available in 
separate protocol- specific documents.  The supply of everolimus  or placebo will be 
shipped directly to the local invest igator. Drug ordering procedures will be provided in 
supplemental study materials.  
8.1.1.1  How Suppli ed 
Everolimus  and an identically appearing  placebo will be provided by Novartis. 
Everolimus  is formulated as tablets for oral administration of 5 mg strength. Tabl ets are 
blister -packed under aluminum foil in units of 10 tablets  per blister card, which should be 
opened only at the time of administration as drug is both hygroscopic and light -sensitive.  
Each tablet contains as inactive ingredients: butylhyroxytoluene/ butylated 
hydroxytoluene (BHT), magnesium stearate, lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, crospovidone and lactose anhydrous.  
Medication labels will comply with US legal requirements and be printed in English. They will supply no information about the patient. The storage conditions for study drug will be described on the medication label.  
8.1.2  Storage Requirements/Stability  
Everolimus  should be stored at  room  temperature  between 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). 
All investigational products must be kept in a secure place under appropriate sto rage 
conditions. A description of the appropriate storage and shipment conditions is specified 
on the investigational product label and investigator brochure. The stored study drug supplies must be accessible to authorized staff only. The storage area must also have 
adequate control of temperature in order to maintain stability and potency of study drug 
supplies. The tablets should be stored in the original pack until use.  For further 
information, investigators should refer  to the current Investigat ors B rochure (IB).  
8.1.3  Handling, Dispensing and Administration 
8.1.3.1  Handling 
No special precautions are necessary when handling intact tablet s. Avoid contact with 
skin and eyes. Wash hands after use. The risk to health in normal handling o f tablet s is 
very low. Exposure to dust from crushed tablet s may cause adverse health effects.  
8.1.3.2  Dispensing  
Drug should be dispensed in original packaging. If  other packaging is required by 
institutional policy,  this procedure will need to be approved by PrE COG , or their 
designee, prior to proceeding.  The PrECOG Site Contact should be contacted for further 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/ 2014 
79 instruction. Investigational product records should be kept as per Section 8. 1.5 and 
institutional policies. 
8.1.3.3  Administration 
Patients should be instructed t o take their assigned , once-a- day oral dose of 
everolimus/placebo at the same time each morning.  
• Everolimus/placebo dose may be taken with or without food.  
• Patients should be instructed to swallow the capsules whole and not chew them.  
• Vomited doses should not be replaced.  
• If the patient forgets to take the medication and remember s by 10 PM, they  may take 
the dose. Otherwise,  skip that dose and begin as usual the next day.  
In cases where tablets cannot be swallowed, the tablets should be disintegrated in wat er 
just prior to being taken. Approximately 30 mL (2 tablespoons)  of water should be put 
into a glass. The tablets  should then be added and the contents stirred gently (for a 
maximum of 7 minutes) until the tablets are disintegrated. The contents should then be 
drunk.  
Patients should be given instructions on correct dosing based on study  requirements  
and toxicity management (dose modifications). All changes to recommended dosing 
regimen/schedule should be documented in the patient record. Documentation of patient 
instructions for dosing changes should also be in source records.  
Patients should be instructed to record the reason for any missed doses and report to 
the investigator at the next visit. If a dose is vomited , that dose should not be replaced, 
(and recorded as a vomited dose).  
Compliance with therapy will be assessed at the beginning of each cycle. Patients will be 
given a diary (see Appendix F for an Example Patient Pill Diary)  for recording of doses of 
study drug as provided by each study site. A copy of the patient diary will be provided to 
sites in study materials.  
8.1.3.4  Special Instructions for Unblinding 
Patients on study therapy and all site study staff will remain blinded as to the assignment 
of everolimus or placebo. Patients who have not had progressive disease and remain on 
study  after 12 cycles  are unblinded and continue fulvestrant alone (if originally 
randomized to placebo) or in combination with everolimus (if originally randomized to 
everolimus) at the same dose and schedule in the C ontinuation P hase.  If an emergency 
situation arises and the patient must be unblinded during the Induction Phase (Cycles 1-12), the Medical Monitor for the study must be consulted.  
Emergency Unblinding  for Patients during the Induction Phase (within Cycles 1- 12): 
Unblinding is a serious action that should be restricted in order to limit potential study 
bias. The breaking  of the blinding code in all cases will render the patient off -protocol.  
The Medical Monitor for the study must be involved in the decision to unblind and must grant approval for unblinding any individual. Requests for unblinding will only be considered in the event of an emergency or severe adverse reaction where identification 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/ 2014 
80 of the medication is considered important for the welfare of the patient,  and the rationale 
for unblinding is applicable to the situation. All patients should be provided emergency 
medical care by the treating physician and appropriate therapies for the medical 
emergency should be initiated prior to the request for unblinding.  
For example, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) possibly, probably or definitely related to 
the study drug occurs during the trial and the treatment of the SAE would be influenced by whether he/she received everolimus  or placebo. Unblinding is typically not nec essary 
if the medical management of the patient would not be materially altered by knowledge 
of the treatment assignment. In the event that accidental  unblinding occurs, the P rincipal 
Investigator  should report the occurrence promptly to the Medical Monitor and document 
the incident in the patient records. All unblinding will be recorded as a protocol deviation.  
If a participant is in a life- threatening situation in which knowledge of the treatment is 
crucial to care AND the Medical Monitor cannot be reached immediately, the P M should 
be contacted to facilitate the unblinding process . A report including the unblinding details 
will be generated after the patient has been unblinded and will be sent to the site for 
documentation ( refer to  Study Reference Manual for Unblinding Process) . Report 
information will include but is not limit ed to:  
• ID number of the participant whose treatment assignment was unblinded 
• Date of unblinding and reconciliation of study drug in site and patient records  
• Reason for unblinding, including initial SAE report  
• Person responsible for unblinding  
• List of persons who are unblinded (e.g. study staff)  
8.1.4  Side Effects  
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥  10%) reported for everolimus include 
stomatitis, rash, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, mucosal inflammation, vomiting, cough, peripheral edema, infections, dry skin,  epistaxis, pruritus, and dyspnea. 
The most commonly reported grade 3- 4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥  2%) reported for 
everolimus include i nfections, stomatitis, fatigue, and pneumonitis.  
8.1.5  Investigational Product Records at Investigational Site(s)  
Investigational product dispensing record/inventory logs and copies of signed packing 
lists must be maintained at the investigational site for everolimus . It is the responsibility 
of the Investigator to ensure that a current record of investigational product disposition is 
maintained at each study site where investigational product is stored and/or dispensed. 
Records must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines, and should include:  
• Amount received and placed in storage area.  
• Amount  currently in storage area.  
• Label ID number or batch number. 
• Dates and initials of person responsible for each investigational product inventory 
entry/movement.

• Amount transferred to another area for dispensing or storage.  
• Non-study disposition (e.g., wasted, broken).  
• Amount returned to manufacturer, if applicable 
• Amount destroyed at study site, if applicable 
8.1.6  Return and Destruction of Investigational Product  
Investigatio nal product should be maintained at the site for accountability purposes. 
Sites will be referred to the study pharmacy manual for instructions regarding the return 
or destruction of everolimus study drug supply (site’s drug destruction policy must be 
revie wed and approved by PrECOG before any study drug can be destroyed at a site) . 
Patients will be instructed to return all blister packs (empty or partially used) to the study 
center.

Refrigerate 2° -8°C (36°-46°F). To protect from light, store in the original carton until time 
of use.  
8.2.2.2  Preparation and Administration  
Fulvestrant  should be disposed of or destroyed as per written institutional policies and 
per recommendations in the current approved Package Insert.  To help avoid infectious 
diseases due to accidental needle sticks, contaminated needles should not be recapped 
or removed, unless there is no alternative or that such action is required by a specific 
medical procedure.  
WARNING: - Do not autoclave safety needle before use. Hands must remain 
behind the needle at all times during use and disposal.  
Directions:  
(Source: Faslodex® Package Insert 1621903 Rev 12/11) 
• Remove the glass syringe barrel from tray and check that it is not damaged 
• Remove perforated patient record label from syringe  
• Peel open the safety needle  outer packaging . 
• Break the seal of the white plastic cover on the syringe luer connector  to remove the 
cover with the attached rubber tip cap (Figure 1).  
• Twist to lock the needle to the luer container. 
• Remove the needle sheath. Pull shield straight off needle to avoid damaging needle 
point.  
• Remove excess gas from the syringe.  
• Administer intramuscularly slowly in the buttock. Administer injection f ollowing 
package instruction. For user convenience, the needle ‘bevel up’ position is 
orientated to the lev er arm (Figure 3).  
• Immediately activate needle protection device upon withdrawal from patient by pushing lever arm completely forward until the tip is fully co vered (Figure 2).  
• Visually confirm that the lever arm has fully advanced and the needle tip is covered. 
If unable to activate, discard immediately into an approved sharps collector. 
Activation of the protective mechanism may cause minimal splatter of fluid that may 
remain on the needle after injection. For greatest safety, use a one- handed 
technique and activate away from self and others.  
• If the 250 mg/5 mL formulation is used, repeat the above steps for the second syringe. After single use, discard in an approved sharps collector in accordance with 
applicable regulations and institutional policy.  
• Review the official package insert for more information regarding the use of the SafetyGlide Needle.

8.2.3  Side Effects  
The most commonly reported adverse experiences in the Faslodex® treatment groups, 
regardless of the investigator’s  assessment of causality, were gastrointestinal symptoms 
(including  nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal pain),  headache, back 
pain, vasodilatation (hot flushes), and pharyngitis.  
Injection site reactions with mild transient pain and inflammation were seen with 
Faslodex® and occurred in 7% of patients (1% of  treatments) given the single 5 mL 
injection (predominately European Trial) and in 27% of patients (4.6% of  treatments) 
given the 2 x 2.5 mL injections (North American Trial). 
Other adverse events reported as drug -related and seen infrequently  (<1%) include 
thromboembolic phenomena, myalgia, vertigo,  leukopenia and hypersensitivity reactions 
including angioedema and urticaria.  Vaginal bleeding has been reported infrequently 
(<1%), mainly in  patients during the first 6 weeks after changing from existing hormonal 
therapy to treatment with Faslodex® If bleeding persists,  further evaluation should be 
considered.

84 9 Statistical Considerations 
The efficacy endpoints will be assessed among all eligible patients who receive protocol 
therapy. Safety endpoints will be assessed among all treated patients, regardless of 
eligibility.  
9.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is progression -free survival (PFS).  PFS is defined as the 
time from randomization to documented disease progression or death. Based on results 
from the CONFIRM trial, median PFS among patients with AI -resistant disease on 
fulvestrant alone is 5.4 months. AI resistant disease is defined as: patients who have 
either relapsed while receiving adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor 
(anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) or have progressive disease while receiving an 
aromatase inhibitor for metastatic disease. (Patients previously treated with two or more prior cycle s of fulvestrant are not eligible.  Patients who have received one prior cycle 
(day 1 and day 15)  of fulvestrant within 28 days of randomization are eligible so long as 
they m eet other eligibility criteria ). Randomization will be 1:1, stratified for balancing 
purposes using ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), presence of measurable disease 
(yes vs. no ), and prior chemotherapy ( yes vs. no). 
We hypothesize that the addition of everolimus  to fulvestrant will result in an 
improvement in median PFS to 9.2 months . A one -sided stratified logrank test with a 
type I error rate of 10% will be used to evaluate whether the addition of everolimus  
shows promising improvement in PFS relative to  fulvestrant alone. To have 90% power 
to detect the hypothesized improvement, enrollment of approximately 120 eligible patients ( 60 per arm) and full information of 98 events (deaths or progressions) are 
required.  Allowing up to 10 patients to be ineligible or to not start study treatment, 
approximately 130 patients will need to be enrolled. With accrual of approximately 130 
patients in 12 months, the required 98 events are expected to occur approximately 12 
mont hs after accrual is completed. Other endpoint s that will be evaluated include clinical 
benefit rate (proportion stable or responding for at least 6 months), objective response rate (CR+PR) , time to progression (TTP; defined as the time from randomization until 
progression of the disease), and overall  survival (OS; defined as the time from 
randomization until death or censored at the date of last follow -up). 
PFS will be evaluated using the stratified log -rank test described above, as will TTP and 
OS. Kapla n-Meier plots will be used to graphically portray these time -to-event endpoints. 
Clinical benefit rate and objective response rates will be compared between arms using Fisher’s exact tests. 90% exact binomial confidence intervals on the rates will be 
provided.  
9.2 Safety Analyses 
A descriptive comparison of overall toxicity and of grade 3- 4 toxicity in the combination 
arm and the fulvestrant arm will be provided. Assuming 65 patients are treated on each arm, the exact binomial 90% confidence interval on the rate of severe toxicities will be no wider than 22% (+/ - 11%). The probabilities of observing a rare toxicity (true rate of 5%) 
will be 96% on each arm.

85 9.3 Analyses of Other Secondary Endpoints  
Other endpoints that will be evaluated include overall survival, time to progression, and 
objective respons e rate . Overall survival will be characterized using Kaplan- Meier plots 
and other descriptive metrics. The objective response rate will be provided for each arm, 
with 90% exact binomial confidence intervals. Median time to progression will be 
estimated for each arm.

86 10 Adverse Event Reporting 
10.1 Collection of Safety Information 
Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening 
of a pre -existing medical condition in a patient administered a medicinal product in a 
clinical investigation and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or diseas e temporally associated 
with the use of a product (investigational or marketed), whether or not considered related to the product (investigational or marketed). Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs and symptoms, are 
considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
Following written consent to participate in the study, all serious AEs should be collected 
on a patient. The collection of non- serious AE information should begin at ini tiation of 
therapy.  
All identified AEs must be recorded and described on the appropriate page of the C ase 
Report Form (CRF) . If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should 
be recorded, rather than individual symptoms. The following information should be documented for all AEs: date of onset and resolution, severity of the event; the investigator’s opinion of the relationship to investigational product (see definitions 
below); treatment required for the AE; cause of the event (if known); and information 
regarding resolution/outcome.  
Severity  
CTCAE t erm (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V ersion 
4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTEP CTCAE 
Version 4.0 (see Appendix E).  
Attribution  
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship or attribution to study drug should be used to assess Adverse Events: 
• Definite: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
event. The event responds  to withdrawal of study drug (dechallenge) and recurs with 
rechallenge, if clinically feasible.  
• Probable: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event. The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not  required.  
• Possible: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear.  
• Unlikely: There is doubtful causal relationship between the study drug and the event.  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/ 2014 
87 • Unrelated: There is clearly not a causal relationship between the study drug and the 
event or there is a causal relationship between another drug, concurrent disease, or 
circumstances and the event.  
Categories ‘Definite’, ‘probable’ and ‘possible’ are considered study drug related. 
Categories ‘not likely’ and ‘not related’ are considered not study drug- related.  
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE. New cancers are those 
that are not the primary reason for administration of study treatment and have been identified after inclusion of the patient into the clinical study.  
AEs related to fulvestrant and/or everolimus/placebo will  be followed for 30 days 
after the last dose of study therapy (fulvestrant and/or  everolimus/placebo) until ≤ 
grade 1 or stabilization, and reported as SAEs if they become serious. Serious 
adverse events >30 days after last dose of fulvestrant and /or everolimus/placebo  
are not reported unless the event may be related to everolimus/placebo.  
10.2 Handling of Serious Ad verse Events (SAEs)  
10.2.1  SAE Definitions  
A serious AE  is any untoward medical occurrence occurring after informed consent is 
granted or that at any dose : 
• results in death,  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the study patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe),  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• is a c ongenital anomaly/birth defect, 
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above.)  
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do  not result in hospitalization. 
10.2.2  SAE Reporting Requirements  
All serious adverse events require expeditious handling and reporting to comply with regulatory requirements. The P rincipal I nvestigator has the obligation to report all  
serious adverse events to PrECOG, or their designee.  A study specific SAE form to be 
utilized for SAE reporting will be provided with supplemental study materials . 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/ 2014 
88 All serious adverse events that occur either during the  study period (Induction and/or 
Continuation)  or within 30 days of discontinuation of dosing regardless of event 
relationship to the study medications (fulvestrant and/or everolimus/placebo) should be 
reported to PrECOG, or their designee within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of 
the event or, when the event occurs on a weekend or national holiday, at  the latest on 
the following  working day. All deaths during treatment or within 30 days following 
completion of active protocol therapy must be reported . Serious adverse events that 
occur >30 days from last dose of fulvestrant and/or everolimus/placebo and are judged 
related to the everolimus/placebo (definitely, probably or possibly)  must be reported to 
PrECOG, or their designee using the 24 hour timeline noted above. If only limited 
information is initially available, f ollow -up reports are required. Serious adverse events 
that occur  >30 days from last dose of fulvestrant and are judged to be related to 
fulvestrant  will follow normal reporting mechanisms for commercial drugs.  
SAE Hotline Phone Number : 
610-354-0404 during normal business hours (8:30 AM – 5 PM EST)  
484-574-2367 after normal business hours (after 5 PM EST) 
SAE Fax Number : 
888-801-8795  
PrECOG will notify Novartis Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department 
(DS&E)  of all  SAE’s within 24 hours  of the Awareness Date. Relevant follow -up 
informati on will be provided to Novartis  DS&E as soon as it becomes available.  
In addition, Investigators should also report event(s) to their IRB as required.  
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important. Full 
descriptions of each event will be followed. Thus, follow -up information which becomes 
available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g., hospital 
discharge summaries and autopsy reports), should be collected subsequently, if not 
available at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent using the same procedure 
as the initial SAE report. The original and all follow -up SAEs form must be kept on file at 
the study site.  
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious adverse experiences will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by PrECOG (or their 
designee) , if applicable. 
10.3 Reporting of Second Primary Cancers  
New cancers are those that are not the primary reason for administration of study treatment and have been identified after inclusion of the patient into the clinical study.  
All cases of new primary cancers  that occur during or after protocol treatment must be 
reported to PrECOG within 30 days of diagnosis, regardless of relationship to protocol treatment. Secondary primary malignancies should also be reported as a SAE. This form 
is not for use for reporting recurrence or development of metastatic disease. A copy of 
the pathology report, if applicable, should be sent, if available.  
Note: Once data regarding survival and remission status are no longer required by the 
protocol, no follow -up data should be submitted, including the PrECOG Second Primary 
Form.

89 11 Administrative  
11.1 Protocol Compliance  
The study shall be conducted as described in this protocol. All revisions to the protocol 
must be discussed with, and be prepared by PrECOG and/or representatives. The 
Investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol or consent 
without prior review and documented approval from PrECOG and/or representatives and the IRB of an amendm ent, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) 
to study patients.  
If a deviation or change to the approved protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) prior to obtaining IRB approval, notification will be submitted to the 
IRB for review and approval as soon as possible afterward. Documentation of approval 
signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB(s) should be in the study records. If 
PrECOG and/or representatives provides an amendment that substantially alters the 
study design or increases the potential risk to the patient; the consent form must be 
revised and submitted to the IRB(s) for review and approval; the revised form must be 
used to obtain consent from patients currently enrolled in the study if they are affect ed 
by the amendment; and the new form must be used to obtain consent from new patients 
prior to study entry. Information as to who investigators should send correspondence will be provided in additional study documents.  
11.2 Institutional Review Board 
Before study initiation, the Investigator must have written and dated approval from their respective IRB for the protocol, consent form, patient recruitment materials/process and any other written information to be provided to patients. The Investigator should also 
provide the IRB with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product labeling, and any 
updates.  
The Investigator should provide the IRB with reports, updates, and other information 
(e.g., Safety Updates, amendments, and administrative letters) according to regulatory 
requirements, IRB or study site procedures.  
11.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
Investigators must ensure that patients who volunteer for clinical trials or their legally acceptable representative are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks and other information. 
A protocol specific informed consent form (ICF) template will be provided to sites. 
Preparation of the site- specific consent form is the responsibility of the site Investigator 
and must include all applicable regulatory and IRB requirements, and must adhere to 
Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. All changes to the ICF template will be approved by PrECOG and/or their representatives prior to implementation.  
In accordance with the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the 
consent process will also include written authorization by patients to release medical 
information to allow PrECOG and/or its agents, regulatory authorities, and the IRB of 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0102  
Confidential  
Date: 1/22/ 2014 
90 record at the study site for access to patient records and medical information relevant to 
the study, including the medical history. This will be documented in the informed consent 
form or other approved form obtained at the time of informed consent per institutional 
policies. This form should also be submitted to PrECOG and/or its agents for review prior to its implementation.  
The Investigator must provide the patient or legally acceptable representative with a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the patient is most proficient. The language must be non- technical and easily 
understood. The Investigator should allow time necessary for patient or patient's legally acceptable representative to inquire about the details of the study, then informed consent must be signed and personally dated by the patient or the patient's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion. The patient or legally acceptable representative should receive a copy of the signed informed consent and any other written information provided to study patients 
prior to patient's participation in the trial. The investigator is responsible for assuring 
adequate documentation of  this process and for storage and maintenance of the original 
signed consent  form for each patient/subject. 
The informed consent and any other information provided to patients or the patient's legally acceptable representative, should be revised whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the patient's consent, and should 
receive IRB approval prior to use. The Investigator, or a person designated by the 
Investigator should inform the patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the patient's 
willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented in the patient record. During a patient's participation in the trial, any updates to the consent form and any updates to the written information will be provided to the 
patient.  
11.4 Safety Communication 
Investigators will be notified of all AEs that are serious, unexpected, and definitely , 
probably, or possibly related to the investigational product. Upon receiving such notices, the Investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and 
submit a copy of this information to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to local regulations. T he Investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent 
requires revision. The Investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. All revisions should be submitted to PrECOG and/or agents for review.  
11.5 Monitoring  
Representatives and agents of PrECOG and, as applicable to the study, the manufacturer of Investigational Product must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the data, quality and study integrity. The purpose of this  visit is to 
review study records and directly compare them with source documents and discuss the conduct of the study with the Investigator, and verify that the facilities remain acceptable.  
The study may be evaluated by other auditors and government inspectors who must be 
allowed access to electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs ), source documents and other

91 study files. The investigator must notify PrECOG of any scheduled visits by regulatory 
authorities, and submit copies of all reports. Information as to who investigators should 
notify of an audit or where to address questions will be provided in additional study 
materials.  Monitoring of drug accountability will also occur.  
11.6 Study Records  
An Investigator is required to maintain adequate regulatory files with corresponding 
communication and approvals, accurate histories, observations and other data on each individual treated. Full details of required regulatory documents will be provided in additional study materials. Data reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the 
source documents  as part of the patient record.  
The confidentiality of records that could identify patients must be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).  
A study specific signature record will be maintained to document signatures and initials 
of all persons at a study site who are authorized to make entries and/or corrections on 
eCRFs as well as document other study -specific roles.  
11.7 Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ) Information  
Additional information regarding eCRF instructions, timelines for data entry/ submission 
and query completion can be found in supplemental materials provided to the site. Sites will be expected to complete eCRFs as per the schedule provided and submit all 
relevant data as per the specified timelines. All items recorded on eCRFs must be found 
in source documents.  
The completed eCRF must be promptly reviewed, electronically signed, and dated by a 
qualified physician who is an Investigator or Sub- Investigator.  
Instructions for management of patients who do not receive any protocol therapy:  
If a patient is randomized and does not receive any assigned protocol treatment, baseline, Serious Adverse Event and follow -up data will still be entered  and must be 
submitted according to the eCRF instructions. Document the reason for not starting 
protocol treatment on the appropriate electronic off-treatment form . 
11.8 Records Retention

106 16 Appendix D: New York Heart Association (NYHA) Cardiac 
Classification of Functional Capacity and Objective 
Assessment  
In 1928 the New York Heart Association published a classification of patients with cardiac 
disease based on clinical severity and prognosis. This classification has been updated in seven 
subsequent editions of Nomenclature and Criteria for Diagnosis of Diseases of the Heart and 
Great Vessels (Little, Brown & Co.). The ninth edition, revised by the Criteria Committee of the American Heart Association, New York City Affiliate, was released March 4, 1994*. The new 
classi fications are summarized below.  
The NYHA classification system relates symptoms to everyday activities and the patient’s quality 
of life.  
Class Symptoms  
Class I  Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitation of physical 
activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, 
palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath), or anginal pain.  
Class II  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical 
activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or anginal pain.  
Class III  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical 
activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes 
fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or anginal pain.  
Class IV  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry out any 
physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or anginal 
syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is 
undertaken, discomfort increases.  
Objective Assessment  
I:  No objective evidence of cardiovascular disease  
II:  Objective evidence of minimal cardiovascular disease  
III:  Objective evidence of moderately severe cardiovascular disease  
IV: Objective evidence of severe cardiovascular disease

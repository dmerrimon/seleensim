PROTOCOL SUMMARY
PF-00547659 is a fully human IgG 2қanti-MAdCAM -1 monoclonal antibody  that binds to human 
MAdCAM to reduce l ymphocy te homing to the gut and GI inflammation and is under 
development for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).
PF-00547659 has been shown to block th e MAdCAM pathway  which decreases leukocy te 
homing to gut b y inhibiting the key  interactions between MAdCAM and the 47+integrin 
expressed on ly mphocy tes. Although the selectively  targeting of the MAdCAM receptors is a 
novel approach, the basic interferen ce of l ymphocy te homing by  preventing the binding of these 
47+ lymphocy tes to the MAdCAM receptor and the resultant efficacy  in UC is well 
established. The main differentiation being that PF -
00547659 blocks the interaction of 47+ 
lymphocy tes to the MA dCAM receptor b y selectively  binding to the receptor. Principal sites of 
the MAdCAM expression on normal tissue includes intestine, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, 
spleen and to a lesser extent lung, liver, and bladder but not in the central nervous s ystem 
(CNS) .1PF-00547659 also does not bind to VCAM and is therefore not expected to be effective 
for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis or affect l ymphocyte homing or surveillance in the CNS.
Subjects who participate in this study will have completed the A7281009 Study .
Objectives :
Primary Objective
The primary  objective of this study  is to monitor the safet y and tolerability  of 
PF-00547659 during long -term treatment.   
Seconda
ryObjective
The secondary  objective is to assess pharmacokinetics and immunogenici tyof 
PF-00547659. 
Exploratory Objective s
Exploratory  objectives include an assessment of the durability  of response with long -term 
treatment with PF
-00547659 based upon Clinical Remission and Clinical Response based 
upon the May o Score performed at Week16 in Clinical Responders from study  
A7281009.
Explore relationships between PK of PF -00547659, PD and clinical endpoints.

Assessment of the durability  of response based upon Clinical Remission and Clinical 
Response based upon Total May o score assessed at W eek16 [28weeks from initial dose] 
in subjects with a Clinical Response in study  A7281009.
Non-Responders from study  A7281009 will also be assessed at Week16 for Clinical 
Remission and Clinical Response. 
Assessment of Clinical Remission and Clinical Response bas ed upon the partial May o 
Score in all 
subjects at W eek40, Week 92 and Week 144.
Simple Clinical Colitis Activity  Index (SCCAI ) will be assessed at monthly  visits .
Partial and May o subscores will also be assessed .
Exploratory Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
Bloo d samples will be collected prior to dosing at baseline and every  4weeks to 
Week24, Week32 and Week72 to measure hsCRP. Also, stool samples will be 
collected at the 
time points noted above to measure fecal calprotectin.

Exploratory Biomarkers (Blood /stool)
Soluble MAdCAM in blood may  be assessed at baseline and Week 16.
Gene expression profiling (mRNA) in blood and protein a ssociated with UC, 
inflammation and mechanism of drug activity may be assessed at baseline, Week 16 and 
Week 72.
Analy ses releva nt to the understanding and treatment of UC may  be conducted on the 
portion of stool samples remaining after calprotectin analy sis. 
Optional E xploratory Endoscopic Substudy:
Endoscopic biopsies at Week 16 for immunohistochemistry  (IHC) that may  include 
different subsets of ly mphocy tes, hematopoietic cells and/or protein biomarkers and 
assessment of RNA transcripts associated with UC, inflammation and mechanism of drug 
activity  (all sites).
Effect of PF -00547659 on mucosal healing (all sites).
Change in biomarkers in endoscopic biops y specimens (at selected centers).

This is a multi -center Phase 2, open- label, safet y extension study  forthe A7281009 study  which 
evaluate sPF
-00547659 in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Subje cts eli gible 
for this study  will have completed the 12 -week double -blind induction period instudy  A7281009
and must have discontinued immunosuppressant therap y.They will then enter into the Active 
Treatment period which consists of two consecutive 18 month periods. The first active period is 
called 
Open Label Treatment Period 1(Weeks 0-72). All subjects will be randomly  assigned to 
receive either 75mg or 225 mgsubcutaneously  every  4
weeks without unblinding treatment 
assignment from the A7281009 study , and without regard to responder status in that study .
After completion of Open L abel Treatment Period 1, all subjects will be permitted to continue in 
Open Label Treatment P eriod 2 (Weeks 76-144) and will receiv e the 75 mg dose on a every  four 
weeks basis for a further 18 months.
Subjects entering this study  will be given 
assigned treatment at the baseline visit and then every  
4weeks through Week 144.  After the active treatment period, the subjects will enter a 6-month 
follow -up period including 2 visits 3months apart .  At the last onsite visit ( Week 168), subjects 
will undergo an End of Study  visit .
In some cases, due to Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) 
approval, regulatory -specific, or other administrative delay s, a subject may  rollover into this 
study  after the 12 -week induction period but no later than the first follow -up visit of the 
A7281009 study with sponsor approval.

Dosing
The Active Treatment Period will be comprised of Open Label Treatment Period 1 and O pen 
Label Treatment Period 2.  During Open Label Treatment Period 1 treatment of 75 mg or 225 mg 
SC, will be administered at baseline and then every  4weeks through Week 72 (Visit 19). Once 
the Open Label Treatment Period 1has been completed, subjects ma y continue for Open Label 
Treatment Period 2 and will be assigned to the 75 mg dose.
After the active treatment period, the subjects will enter a 6
-month follow -up period.  At 
Week 168, subjects will undergo the Final Onsite Study  Visit (see Section 6.3.2).
Dose Interruption
In the event of unforeseen circumstances or life events a dose may  be delay ed or missed up to a 
period of one month. If dosing cannot be resumed, the subject should discontinue active 
treatment and will then undergo the Early  Withdrawal procedures ( Section 6.4) and enter a 
6month follow -up period which includes 2follow -up visits each separated by  3month s.  If the 
subject has a dose he ld and the reason resolves within a one month period, the subject should be 
dosed as soon as possible after resolution and the original study  schedule should be maintained.
Early Withdrawal from OLE Treatment
Subjects may  withdraw from active treatment for a variet y of reasons including: serious adverse 
event, loss of response or withdrawal of consent among others.  Subjects may be discontinued 
from treatment if they  fail to respond.  In such cases, study  drug will be withdrawn, the subject 
will complete ea rly withdrawal procedures (see Section 6.4), and then enter the 6- month 
follow -up period beginning with Visit38(Week 1
56).  
Study Treatments :
Doses of PF -00547659 will be evaluated in subjects with UC.  Doses will be administered 
following the completion of study  procedures at baseline (results of laboratory  evaluations for 
samples collected at Week 12 of A7281009 are not required prior to dosing) and then every  
4weeks ( 7Days of the Projected Visit Date) through Week 144.  Subjects will have study  
medication administered subcutaneousl y in the anterolateral right or left thigh(s). Alternativel y, 
the study  drug may  be injected into the deltoid area or the abdomen. Subjects assigned to receive 
75mg will get a single injection, while those assigned to receive 225 mg will get 3 injections. 
Location of the stud y drug administration should be noted in the source documentation. If there 
are clinical reasons wh y multiple injections cannot be administered in the same leg, the drug may  
be administered in two (2) of these locations. Location of the study  drug administration should 
be noted in the source documentation.
Injection site and allergic reaction monitoring should be completed b y a member of the stud y 
s
taff and observed for a period of at least 30-60 minutes (but the total duration should be 
determined at the discretion of the investigator).

Statistical Analysis :
Sample Size Determination
All eligible subjects, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, fro m the feeder study may be 
enrolled.  It is estimated that approximately  90% of the subjects (about 270 subjects) from stud y 
A7281009 are likel y to enroll into this open label extension study A7281010.  The sample size is 
chosen based on clinical outcome of the feeder study rather than statistical consideration.  
Safety Analysis
Safety  data may  be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis as needed during the study  
since this is an open -label study .  A set of safet y summary  tables will be produced to eval uate 
potential risks associated with the safet y and tolerability of administering the study medication.  
All clinical AEs, SAEs, on-treatment AEs, as well as discontinuations due to AEs will be 
summarized with frequency  and percentage. Continuous outcomes (eg,vitals, safety  lab 
parameters, etc) will be summarized using n, mean, median, standard deviation etc.  Change 
from baseline on selected safet y endpoints may be additionally summarized.  Subject listings 
may also be produced for these safet y endpoints.
The safet y endpoints will be listed and summarized in accordance with Shire Data Standards.  
Detailed methodologies of these analy ses will be described in the SAP.
Interim Analysis
Two interim anal yses (IAs) may be performed for this study  when 50% of su bjects from the 
Phase 2 study  (A7281009) have been enrolled in this study  (A7281010), and the last subject 
from the Phase 2 study  (A7281009) has been enrolled in this study  (A72810 10). The purpose of 
the IA sis to provide additional data on the durability of response, remission, and safet y from 
A728100
9 to facilitate the decision- making process of initiating future studies. Summary  
statistics for safet y, efficacy as well as subject demographics will be provided at IA. Detailed 
analysis will be described in the SAP. 
Additional interim analy ses may  also be performed when it is deemed necessary  to evaluate 
safet y and efficacy during the trial. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Blood samples will be collected prior to dosing for anal ysis of plasma trough concentrati ons of 
PF-00547659.  Plasma concentration data obtained from all subjects in this study  will be 
tabulated and plotted to assess average stead y state concentrations following repeat subcutaneous 
(SC)dosing of PF -00547659.  As subjects enrolled in this stud y will have previously  been 
followed in a separate protocol where more PK sampling may  have been performed, the trough 
PK data collected from this study  may  be combined with data from the previous study  into a 
single database.

Exploratory Efficacy Analys is
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the exploratory  efficacy  analy sis. The binary  
endpoints such as clinical remission, clinical response will be summarized with frequency  and 
percentage b y time point; and the continuous variables will be summa rized with n, mean, 
median, standard deviation etc. These summaries may  be provided by  the strata of respond er
status at ent ry base d on the feeder study . 
All subjects who have received at least one dose of planned investigational product in the open 
label extension study  will be included into the exploraty  efficacy  anal ysis. Detailed 
methodologies of these analy ses will be described in the SAP.
Exploratory Pharmacodynamic Analysis
Fecal calprotectin ,hsCRP and exploratory  biomarkers 
will be listed and su mmarized by  visit, 
and change from baseline for these endpoints will also be summarized at specific time points as 
reported in the Schedule of Activities (SOA ). 
Appropriate regression models may  be used to look at association between these endpoints and 
any covariates of clinical interests. 
Data Monitoring Committee
An external Data Monitoring Committee will be in place to review the safety  of subjects on an 
ongoing basis and to adjudicate an y subjects with unexplained neurological or cardiac findings.  
Membership of this committee shall include at least one neurologist with expertise in Progressive 
Multifocal Leukencephalopahty  (PML )and one cardiologist with expertise in heart failure and/or 
myocarditis. Work -up of such suspected PML cases will include a neurology  consultation as 
well as an MRI scan, and a lumbar puncture, if clinically  indicated.  Additional procedures may  
be deemed necessary .  Given the lack of therapeutic options for subjects who have failed at least 
1conventional therap y, PF-00547659 with its distinct mechanism of action and known safety  
profile appears to have a favorable Risk-Benefit profile.  
Additional cardiac monitoring will be implemented in this study .  Serum samples for CPK (with 
reflex isoenzy mes), troponin I and NT -proBNP will be drawn with the safety  labs.  Elevation of 
cardiac 
troponin I (cTnI) >0.05 ng/mL or CPK with MB should prompt a cardiology  consult.  
Any subject who experiences an initial on -study  elevatio n of NTproBNP to >300 pg/mL shall 
have an echocardiogram and cardiology  consult. All subjects who have had an echocardiogram, 
in whom the NTproBNP remains >124 pg/mL at the Week144 visit, shall have a repeat 
echocardiogram and cardiology  consultation ord
ered no later than the following visit. All cases 
of on -study  elevation of NTproBNP to >300 pg/mL , elevation in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) or 
CK/MB or new electrocardiogram ( ECG )changes will be reviewed b y the DMC.
The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of safet y of subjects in the study  according 
to the Charter.  The recommendations made by  the DMC to alter the conduct of the study  or 
amend the protocol will be forwarded to Shire for final decision.  Shire will notify  investigative 
sites and r egulatory  authorities as appropriate.

a. Baseline (Day 1, Visit 1) pro cedures will correspond w ith the procedures conducted at the Week 12 (Day 84) or final visit in study A7281009.  Data 
transferred from study A7281009 and recorded on the appropriate eCRF will be captured after the ICD is signed.  The ICD for this study mus t be signed and 
dated before protocol -related procedures are performed.  All baseline assessments and procedures must be completed prior to administration of the o pen 
label investigational product.
b.Responder/nonresponder analysis will be determined at the Week 12 (Day 84) or final visit of study A7281009.  This determination will be made based on 
the Total Mayo score.
c.Vital signs (single sitting blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, and respirations [measured after 5 minute rest], temperature (or al or tympanic [ ºC or ºF]), and 
weight (lbs or kg; measured without shoes) do not need to be repeated; how ever, the information must be entered into the eCRF .  Source documentation 
supporting this data previously obtained at the Week 12 (Day 84) or final visit of the stud y A7281009 must be available in the subject’s record for this study .
d.Baseline evaluations/assessments that were previously obtained at the Week 12 (Day 84) or final visit of study A7281009 do no t need to be repeated, nor any 
information entered into the eCRF.  Source documentation supporting this data previously obtained at the Week 12 (Day 84) or final visit of the study 
A7281009 must be available in the subject’s record for this study.  Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant treatment(s) that ar e continuin g from study 
A7281009 w ill be recorded on the source documents and the respective AE and CM eCRFs at the baseline visit.  Note:  No blood or urine samples will be 
collected for the baseline visit of this study unless there is a need to repeat a safety labo ratory test or tests.
e.To include NT- proBNP and troponin I levels for additional cardiac monitoring .ECHO and cardiology consult will be performed locally only under specified 
conditions. These conditions are:
At baseline visit: if NTproBNP value is >300 pg/mL if no prior ECHO .
At the on-treatment visits up to W eek 144: If no prior ECHO, the first time NTproBNP is >300 pg/mL .
At the Week 144or early withdrawal visit: If there has been any prior ECHO AND the NTproBNP is >124 pg/mL or if there has been no prior 
ECHO, and the NTproBNP is >300 pg/mL .
At the post-week 144visits: if there has been no prior ECHO and NTproBNP is >300 pg/mL .
f.For w omen of childbearing potential only.  A negative urine pregnancy test result is required beginning at baseline before investigational product 
administration ,andat all subsequent visits during the open -label treatment period, the follow -up visit, and at early withdraw al (if necessary).
g.Flexible sigmoidoscopy or Colonoscopy if recommended. Colonoscopy will be performed atVisits 1 1-19 for subjects undergoing routine cancer 
surveillance .

h.Eligible subjects w ill be asked if they would like to continue participation in an optional endoscopic substudy that will characterize the effect of 
PF-00547659 on mucosal healing and tissu e biology .Participation in this part of the study will not affect participation in the main study (see Section 7.4.2 ).
i.The detection of C. difficile by toxigenic stool culture [stool culture followed by detection of toxin] is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of the 
colonization or infection with pathogenic C. difficile .  Comparable sensitivity may be achieved by direct testing of stool via point of use rapid membrane 
enzyme immunoassay card for both C. difficile toxin A and B and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen on a card.  Use of the card for point of care 
screening is encouraged where permitted by local regulation.  Molecular techniques such as PCR for detection of toxin RNA are also acceptable alternatives. 
Refer to the lab manual for further guidance and instruction for C. difficile testing. This test w ill be mandatory for subjects who experience a disease flare 
and/or dose de-escalate.
j.PK samples will be collected before dosing at v isits where study drug will be administered.
k.As part of the complete physical examination and targeted physical examination.  A confrontation visual field test will be performed to measure overall field 
of vision as a basic screening tool.
l.The timed 25-foot time walk (T25 -FW) test is part of the neurologic assessment and measures quantitative mobility and leg function.
m.The nine -hole peg test (9 -HPT) is part of the neurologic assessment and measures upper extremity function.
n.The Symbol Digit Modality Test ( SDMT ) is part of the neurologic assessment and assesses cognitive functioning over time and in response to treatment.   To 
help score the test, subjects must enter level of education completed onto the Social Status CRF page .
o.The patient -MSNQ (Multiple Scler osis Neuropsychological Questionnaire) is part of the neurologic 
assessment and assesses cognitive functioning over time.
p. Sam ples may be stored and batched for analysis. At a minimum, baseline and end -of-study sample will be tested.
q.Responder analysis wil l be determined at Week 12 of study A7281009. This determination will be made based on the Total Mayo Score.
r.The subject stool diary to collect stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be collected via paper diary. Subjects will be required to enter diar y data for 3 days 
immediately preceding the flexible sigmoidoscopy visit prior to Week 16. Should any subject be required to perform bowel preparation prior to the flexible 
sigmoidoscopy at Week 16, the subject should be instructed to complete the diary 1 day prior to initiating bowel preparation. Diaries to be completed by the 
subject will be distributed during the baseline visit [Week 12 of study A7281009 (for collection at the flexible sigmoidoscopy visit prior to Week 16)].
s.At Visits7 and 9 -17, dispe nse stool specimen container and bag to subjects who have had a disease flare only.
t.A Total Mayo Score will be calculated for subjects undergoing routine cancer surveillance at Visits 11- 19.A Partial Mayo Score w ill be calculated for all 
other subjects a t these visits.
u.Does not include endoscopic biopsies performed at selected cent
ers (see Section 7.4.2 ). However, mucosal healing may be assessed.

1.INTRODUCTION
Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing disease marked b y ulceration and inflammation of 
the colonic mucosa and submucosa. Initially  it usually  involves the rectum but may  extend 
proximally  to involve a portion of or the entire colon. In the early  stages hemorrhagic and 
erythematous tissue is observed, progressing to mucosal ulceration with purulent exudates in 
severe cases. The ulceration pattern is continuous and may  extend the entire length of the colon.
Perforation of the bowel wall causing ileus and peritonitis can occur with transmural extension of 
the ulceration. Blood y diarrhea with or without mucus and lower abdominal pain with periods of 
remission and exacerbation are the most common symptoms.
The incidence of UC in the United States (US) is 10-12 cases per 100,000 person years. It 
occurs more frequently  in Caucasians and affects 30% more females than males. Although UC 
can occur at an y age, the incidence peaks between 15 to 25 years and 55 to 65 years.2UC is a 
lifelong condition with a serious effect on the quality  of life. Current treatment primarily  consists 
of sy mptomatic management with dietary  modifications, 5 -aminosalicy lic acid (5 -ASA), opiates 
such as loperamide, s ystemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine/6 -
mercaptopurine, cy closporine), and most recentl y anti -tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )agents. 
However, despite recent advances, effective pharmacological treatment is needed which will 
induce and mainta in remission.
While colectomy  cures the disease and removes the possibility  of colon cancer, the long -term
postoperative course may require adjustment to an ileostomy , ileoanal anastomosis, or
management of the chronic inflammation of an ileoanal pouch (po uchitis). Asignificant number 
of patients are refractory  or unresponsive to conventional medical therapy , in addition to those 
patients who need more effective and tolerable therap y to maintain remissions and avoid surgery.
1.1.Indication
PF-
00547659, also r eferred to as SHP647 (MAdCAM) or SHP647, is a fully human IgG 2 қ
anti-MAdCAM -1 monoclonal antibody , which is being developed by Shire as a treatment for the 
induction and maintenance of remission of Crohn’s disease ( CD)and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) .
1.2.Backgro
und and Rationale
PF-00547659 is a full y human IgG 2қanti-MAdCAM -1monoclonal antibody  that binds to 
MAdCAM with high affinity  and selectivity  to reduce l ymphocy te homing to the gut and GI 
inflammation.
The selectivit y of l ymphocy te homing to specialized l ymphoid tissue and mucosal sites of the 
gastrointestinal tract is determined b y the endothelial expression of the mucosal addressin cell 
adhesion molecule (MAdCAM). MAdCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin super family  of 
cell adhesion molecules and is mo stly expressed on the cell surface of high endothelial venules 
of organized intestinal lymphoid tissue such as Peyer’s patches and mesenteric l ymph nodes.3
MAdCAM play s a role in gut immune surveillance, and also appears to facilitate excessive 
lymphocy teinfiltration under conditions of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation.  The 47+
integrin is the recognized ligand for MAdCAM and expression of this ligand on populations of 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that distinguishes them a s unique gut homing l ymphocy tes.

A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
PF-00547659 is an anti -MAdCAM monoclonal antibody  with high affinity  and selectivity that 
prevents the binding of α 4β7+ lymphocy tes to MAdCAM expressing sites in the high endothelial 
venules of the gastrointestinal tract.
1.2.1. Study Rationale
The rationale for conducting this open- label extension (OL E)study  is primarily  to evaluate 
long-term safet y of PF -00547659. This protocol also provides the opportunity  for continued 
treatment for subjects who completed study  A7281009. 
1.2.2. Rationale for D iscontinuing Immunosuppressive Therapy
The greatest concern for the safet y of subjects receiving therapy that acts on the integrin/CAM 
axis of ly mphocy te trafficking is the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML). 
This risk was first identified in subjects treated with natalizumab, an agent that targets the 4 
integrin on l ymphocy tes and is used to treat subjects with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Crohn’s 
disease. 
As of January  2012, three risk factors associated with increased risk of PML  have been 
identified: prolonged use of natalizumab (2- 4 years), JC virus seropositivity , and prior thera py 
with immunosuppressant agents. While no data have been presented for subjects who are JC 
virus seronegative, the PML  incidence in JC virus seropositive subjects is shown in the table 
below:
Estimated PML Incidence Stratified by Risk Factor2
Anti -JCV An tibody Positive* Anti -JCV Antibody Positive*
Tysabri Exposure† No Prior Immunosuppressant Use Prior I mmunosuppressant Use
1-24 months <1/1,000 2/1,000
25-48 months 4/1,000 11/1,000
Notes: Based on postmarketing PML data and Tysabri use data as of Septe mber 1, 2011.
†Data beyond 4 years of treatment are limited.
* Risk in anti -JCV antibody positive patients was estimated based on the assumptions that 18% of Tysabri -treated 
MS patients have a history of prior immunosuppressant treatment and that 55% of Ty sabri -treated MS patients are 
anti-JCV antibody positive.
*The anti -JCV antibody status w as determined using an anti -JCV antibody test (ELISA) that has been analytically 
and clinically validated and is configured w ith detection and inhibition steps to confirm the presence of JCV- specific 
antibodies with a false negative rate of 3%.
The maximum duration of study  drug treatment anticipated at present is 3 months for subjects 
who receive active drug in study  A7281009 plus 18 months for those who choose to ent er this 
open label extension study , A7281010, for a total of 21 months. Subjects receiving Ty sabri who 
had prior immunosuppressant therap y would be expected to have a PML risk of 0.2% if they  
were seropositive for JC virus, while the risk in seronegative i ndividuals is not known.
The causative infectious agent of PML is the JC virus, a poly oma virus that is asy mptomaticall y 
present in the majorit y of adults in whom the prevalence of seropositivity increases with age. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 34
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
The mechanism of increased risk for PM L in subjects treated with natalizumab is not known, but 
may involve reduced immune surveillance of the central nervous s ystem. The JC virus appears 
to cause PML only in subjects with significant immune compromise, such as that associated with 
HIV infecti on, transplant -associated immunosuppression or treated leukemia.
In order to minimize the potential risk of excessive 
immunosuppression in study  subjects , it is 
important to 
discontinue immunosuppressant therapy. Subject s entering this OL E study , 
regardle ss of disease activity , will have discontinue dall immunosuppressant therapy . Subjects 
entering this trial will have received 3 doses of investigational therap y, but 25% of those subjects 
will have received placebo in study  A7281009. Since immunosuppress ants were withdrawn
during the previous study, there may  be an increased risk of disease exacerbation in subjects who 
have not received an y treatment with PF -00547659. Subjects will therefore be allowed to treat 
any disease exacerbations with oral corticosteroids for 6 months in clinically  appropriate doses 
and durations. Immunosuppressants are not allowed in this study . 
1.2.3. Dose Selection Rationale
Study  A7281001, a single and multiple dose study in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) was conducted 
with multiple IV and 3subcutaneous ( SC)doses in 60 subjects including: Single dose from 
0.03-10.0 mg/kg IV; Multiple dose 0.1 - 3.0mg/kg IV; Single dose 3.0 mg/kg SC; Multiple dose 
0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg SC.  Results of the study  indicate that PF -00547659 was well- tolerated with 
adverse reaction rates similar to placebo.  Approximately  half of the subjects received 
background azathioprine.  There was no pattern of adverse events suggestive of increased risk of 
opportunistic infections or CNS effects.  SAEs and adverse events ( AEs) leading to withdrawal 
were due to exacerbations of the underl ying UC unrelated to dose or treatment assignment.  
There was no evidence of adverse effects on laboratory  parameters, electrocardiogram ( ECG ), 
vital signs, or neurological function. 
Preliminar y efficacy  findings (May o Score) in the Study  A7281001 were promising with higher 
response and remission rate for PF-00547659 as compared to Placebo; however, no 
dose-response relationship was observed in part due to the small sample size limitations. Results 
of biomarker assay s (fecal calprotectin) supported the clinical findings of this study . 
PF-
00547659 exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics (PK) with higher clearance at lower doses. 
The PK profile can be described using a mathematic model which depict s drug -binding to 
MAdCAM causing nonlinear clearance of PF -00547659, also called target- mediated drug 
disposition (TMDD) model. Availability  of pharmacokinetic data covering a wide range of 
doses, made possible the development of a TMDD. A population PK model adequatel y 
described the nonlinear PK of PF-00547659 in A7281001. 
The twodosesfrom study  A7281009, considered most likely  to be effective, 75and 225 mg SC 
every  4 weeks, have been selected as the starting dose sin this study .  It is predicted tha t 75mg 
SC every  4weeks will provide >98% MAdCAM suppression in >90% of subjects over a 4 -week 
interval.  Escalation from 75 mg to 225 mg SC every  4weeks will be allowed, at the 
Investigator’s discretion, for subjects that experience a relapse or who hav e had no response b y 
Week 8.  A 225 mg SC dose is expected to provide >99% MAdCAM suppression in >90% of the 
population at the end of a 4- week interval.

1.2.3.1. Active Treatment Period
The Active Treatment Period will be comprised of an Open Label Treatment Period 1 
(Weeks 0-72) and an Open Label Treatment Period 2 (Weeks 76-144). During the Open Label 
Treatment Period 1 subjects will be randomized to 75 mg or 225 mg SC starting at baseline and 
then every  4weeks through 
Week72 (Visit 19). After completion of th e Open Label Treatment
Period 1 randomized subjects will be permitted to continue to receive treatment in an Open Label 
Treatment Period 2 for a further 72 weeks ( 18months )at a dose of 75 mg every  4 weeks through 
Week144. This dose was selected based u pon the results of the A7281009 study  that indicated 
no additional benefit associated with the 225 mg dose.
1.2.4. Safety Data
1.2.4.1. Non-
Clinical Safety
Non-clinical pharmacology  data indicate that blockade of the MAdCAM pathway  decreases 
leukocy te homing to the gut by inhibiting the key  interaction between MAdCAM and the 47
integrin expressed on lymphocytes.  PF -00547659 binds to recombinant human MAdCAM with 
a K Dof 16.1 pM, and was shown to inhibit the adhesion of 47expressing cells (human JY, 
B-cell line) to human and cy nomolgus MAdCAM.  PF -00547659 does not bind to the closely  
related VCAM adhesion molecule, or Fcreceptor, and does not stimulate the in vitro release of 
pro-inflammatory  cytokine sfrom human whole blood.  When administered to cy nomolgus 
monkey s, PF-00547659 caused a dose -dependent increase in blood levels of 7+central memory 
Tcells with co ncurrent increases in CD 4+7+ effector and naïve cells, b y presumabl y reducing 
MAdCAM -mediated l ymphocy te homing to the gut.
Repeat -dose toxicity  studies, dosing once every  10days, were conducted with PF -00547659 in 
cynomolgus monkey s for up to 6 months. In all studies, the drug was generally  well-tolerated at 
doses up to 100 mg/kg. The exception was one high dose female receiving 100 mg/kg in the 
1-month IV study  that became moribund starting on study  Day15in the period between the 
second and third doses. This animal’s clinical condition required euthanasia, and at post -
mortem 
this animal was diagnosed with my ocardial inflammation of unknown etiology  resulting in heart 
failure. A recent expert diagnostic opinion on this animal suggested that my ocarditis was a 
component of Sy stemic Inflammatory  Response Sy ndrome (SI RS), triggered by  ulcerative 
gingivitis, and not a primary  myocardial inflammation. Ultimately , it was unknown whether 
inflammation in the heart in this single animal was related to the pharmacological activity  of 
PF-00547659 or was the result of spontaneous disease. It is notable that my ocardial 
inflammation in this animal was an isolated o ccurrence and did not occur in any  other animal in 
this study , nor in the subsequent 1 -month SC or 6 -month SC and I V repeat -dose studies at doses 
up to 100 mg/kg. Other notable findings in repeat -dose toxicology  studies included sporadic 
local or s ystemic hypersensitivity  reactions such as anaphy laxis (1 animal,10 mg/kg, 1- month IV 
study ), nonadverse self -limiting skin rash/injection site reactions (sporadic at doses of 10 mg/kg 
and greater across studies), and glomerulonephropathy  (2animals receiving 100 mg/kg SC in the 
6-month studies). Hypersensitivity  reactions were not unexpected in nonhuman primates 
receiving repeated large doses of foreign (i e,human) protein. For detailed summaries of the 
findings in the toxicology  studies, please refer to Sectio
n 5.3 of the Investigator’s Brochure.

1.2.5. Anticipated Risks
A total of 60 subjects have received single doses up to 10 mg/kg (24subjects) or 3 doses of up to 
3mg/kg (36 subjects) of PF -00547659 or placebo (20 subjects) in the Phase Iclinical study  
(A7281001) with adverse events comparable to placebo.  The majority  of withdrawals due to 
AEs or SAEs were related to lack of efficacy  particularl y with single or subtherapeutic doses.
Since April 2011, study  drug has been under investigation for the treatment of patients with 
moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. As of 31 March 2012, 31 subjects have entered the 
induction study , 11 have entered the open label extension study  and 148 monthly  doses of stud y 
drug have been administered. 3subjects experienced a single episode of injection site pain or 
burning (2% of injections). 
During the CD induction study  (OPERA, A7281006) three subjects reported Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs): 2 small bowel obstructions, 1 with ileus, and one subject had electrol yte 
abnormalities th at required hospitalization. None of these was considered related to stud y drug. 
Seven subjects reported nonserious adverse events related to study  drug; none of these events 
occurred in more than one subject. 18subjects reported unrelated adverse events; 3 reported 
mild to moderate nausea and vomiting, and 2 each reported blurred vision, fever, elevated 
neutrophil count, flatulence, and frequent bowel movements.
In the CD Open Label Extension study  (OPERA 2, A7281007) 3 subjects reported 6 SAEs, none 
related to stud y drug: worsening Crohn’s disease, viral gastroenteritis, rectal hemorrhage, viral 
upper respiratory  tract infection, tooth abscess and a urinary  tract infection. One subject reported 
a SAE related to stud y drug: a left hydrocele with cellul itis that resolved without treatment. 
7subjects reported nonserious AEs related to study  drug. 2 subjects reported vomiting, while the 
other AEs were reported only  by one subject. 6subjects reported unrelated AEs. 3reported 
arthralgia, and 2 (the sa me 2 as in OPERA) reported blurred vision. All other AEs were reported 
only by single subjects.
The mechanism of action of PF -00547659, an anti -MAdCAM receptor antibody , is distinct from 
natalizumab in that it does not directly  bind to 47+ T-lymphocy tes.  It prevents the binding of 
47+ T-lymphocy tes to the MAdCAM receptor but does not affect binding to ICAM or 
VCAM.  Therefore, it is not expected to affect CNS ly mphocy te surveillance.  However, since 
the drug is earl y in development and due to some ov erlap of the mechanisms, additional 
prudence is warranted.
In addition to routine safety , additional surveillance will be in place to look for potential cases of 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopath y(PML ) as a precaution due to the increased risk 
seen with natalizumab.4Subjects with unexplained neurological changes, new onset seizures, 
sensory  or motor neuropathy , cognitive or behavior changes observed during the treatment 
period will undergo neurologic evaluation and if appropriate discontinue trea tment and enter the 
follow -up period. Samples for JC virus testing will be taken every  6months throughout the 
study  until the final onsite visit .
The following neurological assessments will be performed monthly  throughout the Open Label 
Treatment Period 1and the Open Label Treatment Period 2:
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 37
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
Confrontational Visual Fields will be performed as part of the ph ysical exam.
Timed 25- Foot Walk (T25FW) .
9-Hole Peg Test (9 -HPT) .
Symbol Digit Modality  Test (SDMT -written) .
Patient
-Multiple Sclerosis Neurops ycholog ical Questionnaire (MSNQ) .(Does not trigger 
a neurology  consult (refer to Special Safety Assessments Section 7.3).
1.2.6. Risk Benefit
The subjects that roll- over into this study  from A7281009 will have complete d Week 12 
(Day 84). These subjects have failed at least 1 conventional therapy .  This open- label extension 
study  will provide additional treatment for these subjects with limited therapeutic options. 
Beyond anti -TNFs, patients with inflammatory  bowel dis ease have limited options for biologic 
therap y.  One agent, approved for Crohn’s disease only  in the US is natalizumab , which has a 
0.1% (1:1000) incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML)5which makes it 
unacceptable to most subjects with Crohn’s disease and their ph ysicians.  
PF-00547659, an anti -MAdCAM monoclonal anti body  under investigation for the treatment of 
both CD and UC, provides a novel mechanism of action that is distinct from natalizumab. There 
is no interference with centr al nervous s ystem ly mphocy te surveillance since the drug binds to 
the MAdCAM receptor which is primarily located to venules of the GI tract and to a lesser extent 
lung, liver and spleen but is not present in the central nervous s ystem. Natalizumab binds t o the 
47+ and 41+ lymphocy tes and prevents their binding to MAdCAM in the GI tract.  
Therefore, for subjects with ulcerative colitis the efficacy  may be similar.  However, natalizumab 
also prevents these l ymphocy tes from binding to VCAM6in the choroid plexus which is 
responsible for its efficacy  in Multiple Sclerosis.  
PF-00547659 demonstrated a favorable safet
y profile in the Phase 1 single and multiple dose 
study  conducted in subjects with ulcerative colitis.  However, due to the limited safet y database, 
additional precautions will be taken to ensure the safet y of subjects.  Subjects will not be allowed 
long-term co-administration with immunosuppres sives since IS use has been associated with 
increased risk of PML in MS patients taking Ty sabri. Howev er, the t ype of I S used is quite 
different from those used in IBD and it is not known whether or not inflammatory  CNS disease 
makes patients more prone to PML .  Since subjects may  have stopped immunosuppressives 
shortly  before entering into this study , they ma y be at increased risk for exacerbation or flare of 
their ulcerative colitis, especiall y subjects who enroll from the placebo -treatment arm of study  
A7281009.
Monitoring of subjects will include standardized focused neurological assessments, and JC vir us 
testing throughout the study  and follow -up period.  Any  new unexplained neurological finding 
will trigger an immediate neurologic consultation with appropriate actions. Samples for JC virus 
testing will be taken every 6 months throughout the study  until the final onsite visit .In addition, 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 38
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
an external Data Monitoring Committee will be in place to adjudicate an y subjects with 
unexplained neurological findings.  
Given the lack of therapeutic options for subjects who have failed at least 1 conventional 
therap y, PF-00547659 with its distinct mechanism of action and known safety  profile appears to 
have a favorable Risk-Benefit profile.  The added precautions regarding Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopath y (PML) are probabl y unnecessary  but will serve t o increase the confidence 
in PF -00547659 in future development. 
Alway s refer to the latest version of the investigator’s brochure for the overall risk/benefit 
assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding the drug metabolism, 
pharmaco kinetics, efficacy  and safet y.

3.STUDY DESIGN
This is a multi -center Phase 2, open
-label, safet y extension study  for the A7281009 study  which 
evaluate sPF
-00547659 in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Subjects eligible 
for this study  will have completed the 12 -week double -blind induction period in study  A7281009
and must have discontinued immunosuppressant therap y. They  will then enter into the Active 
Treatm ent period which consists of two consecutive 18 month periods. The first active period is 
called Open Label Treatment Period 1 (Weeks 0-72). All subjects will be randomly  assigned to 
receive either 75 mg or 225 mg subcutaneously  every  4weeks without unb linding treatment 
assignment from the 
A7281009 study , and without regard to responder status in that study . 
After completion of Open L abel Treatment Period 1, all subjects will be permitted to continue in 
Open Label Treatment Period 2 (Weeks 76-144) and wi ll receive the 75 mg dose every  four 
weeks for a further 18 months. 
After the active treatment period, the subjects will enter a 6
-month follow -up period including 
2visits 3months apart.   At the last onsite visit (Week 168), subjects will undergo an End of 
Study  visit .
In some cases, due to Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) 
approval, regulatory -specific, or other administrative delay s, a subject may  rollover into this 
study  after the 12 -week induction period but no late r than the first follow -up visit of Study  
A7281009 with sponsor approval.
3.1.Dosing
The Active T reatment Period will be comprised of Open Label Treatment Period 1 and Open 
Label Treatment Period 2.During the Open Label Treatment Period 1, 75 mg or 225 mg SC, 
will be administered at baseline and then every  4weeks through Week 72 (Visit 19).  
Once the 
Open Label T reatment P eriod 1 has been completed, subjects may  continue for Open Label 
Treatment Period 2 and will be assigned to the 75 mg dose.
After the acti ve treatment period, the subjects will enter a 6
-month follow -up period.  At 
Week 168, subjects will undergo the Final Onsite Study  Visit (see Section 6.3.2).

Dose Interruption
In the event of unforeseen c ircumstances or life events a dose may  be delay ed or missed up to a 
period of one month. If dosing cannot be resumed, the subject should discontinue active 
treatment and will then undergo the Early  Withdrawal procedures (Section 6.4)and enter a 
6-month follow - up period which includes 2 follow -up visits separated b y 3month s.If the 
subject has a dose held and the reason resolves within a one month period , the subject should be 
dosed as soon as possible af ter resolution and the original study  schedule should be maintained.
Early Withdrawal from OLE Treatment
Subjects may  withdraw from active treatment for a variet y of reasons including: serious adverse 
events, loss of response or widrawal of consent among others. Subjects will be discontinued 
from treatment, if they  fail to respond. Investigational product will be withdrawn, the subject 
will complete earl y withdrawal procedures (see Section 6.4), and then e nter the 6-month 
follow -up period beginning with Visit38(Week 1
56).
3.2.Approximate Duration of Subject Participation
Subjects will actively  participate in this study  for up to 43months .  This includes a 37 m onth 
treatment period and a 6month follow -up per iod.  Dosing of eligible subjects will begin at the 
baseline visit and continue every  4
weeks through W eek144. Subjects will return to the study  
site for visits every  4
weeks from their baseline visit (Week 0) through the treatment and 
follow -up periods until Visit 39[Week 168(End of Study  visit)] unless they  withdraw earl y.
3.3.Approximate Duration of Study
This study will be clinically  complete in approximately  78months.
3.4.Approximate Number of Subjects
All eligible subjects, based on inclusion/exclusion c riteria, from the A7281009 study  may  be 
enrolled. 
Approximately  331 subjects (estimated as 90% of the subjects in A7281009) are anticipated to 
be eligible for this study  at Week

treatment period.
5.2.Drug Sup plies
5.2.1. Formulation and Packaging
Investigational product is packaged in the followed labeled containers: Active PF -00547659
Injection, 
approximately  75mg/mL  will be presented as a ready to use sterile solution in a vial .
5.2.2. Preparation and Dispensing
A pharma cist or other qualified person ( eg,registered nurse with previous experience in drug 
preparation andwithdrawing solution from sterile vials via a syringe) at the Clinical Site, will 
prepare each dose of investigational product according to the Dosing an Administration 
Instructions (DAI), supplied under a separate cover.
5.2.3. Administration
Doses of PF -00547659 (75 mgSC[and 225mgSC, if required]) will be evaluated in subjects 
with UC.  Doses will be administered following the completion of study procedure s at 
baseline 
(results of laboratory  evaluations for samples collected at Week12 of A7281009 are not required 
prior to dosing) and then every  4weeks ( 7Days of the Projected Visit Date) through Week144.  
Subjects will have study  medication administered subcutaneousl y in the an terolateral right or left 
thigh (s).Alternativel
y, the study  drug may  be injected into the deltoid area, or the abdomen. I f 
there are clinical reasons why multiple injections cannot be administered in the same leg, the 
drug may  be administered in two (2) of these locations. Location of the study  drug 
administration should be noted in the source documentation.
Drug product will be administered according to Dosage and Administration I nstructions (DAI) 
provided under separate cover as a 75 mg/ml solution at a maximum of 1.0 mLper injection.

Injection site and allergic reaction monitoring should be completed b y amember of the stud y 
staff andobserve dfor a period of at least 30-60 minutes (but the total duration should be 
determined at the discretion of the investigator) .
Investigator directed delays in dosing due to abnormal labs or AEs should be discussed with the 
sponsor to det ermine whether the subject should remain in the study .
The investigator, or an approved representative (e g,pharmacist), will ensure that all 
investigational product is dispensed by  qualified staff members.
5.2.4. Compliance
All doses of the investigational product will be administered under the supervision of 
investigator site personnel and recorded on source documents and CRFs.
5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability
Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, I nvestigator Brochure [ IB], Core Data Sheet [CDS ], 
Unite d States Package Insert [USPI ], Summary  of Product Characteristics [SPC], or L ocal 
Product Document [LPD])may be superseded by  the label storage.
Investigators and site staff are reminded to ensure that thermometers are working correctly  as 
required for proper storage of investigational products.  These include thermometers for both the 
room storage and refrigerator storage.  The sponsor must be notified immediately  upon discovery  
of an y excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will req uire site 
investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of 
excursions on the investigational product and will provide supportive documentation as 
necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact 
has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the sponsor.
All investigational product is stored in refrigerated temperatures (2 -8C) and in accordance with 
applicable regulatory  requirements.   
Unless o
therwise authorized by  Shire, all unallocated or drug supplies unused by  the subjects 
must be returned to Shire or its appointed agent (eg, CRO) at the end of the clinical trial.  If Shire
authorizes destruction at the study  site, the investigator must ens ure that the materials are 
destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  
special instructions provided by
 Shire .  Destruction must be adequatel y documented.
5.4.Prior 
Treatment (s)

5.5.1. Steroids Taken During ThisStudy
Any steroids taken during this study  will be recorded on a separate CRF page. The CRF page 
will capture start and stop dates, total daily  dose and unit.
5.5.2. Prohibited During Th is Study
Any live (attenuated) vaccines.
Useof AZA, 6 -MP or MTX .
Any investigational or marketed biologic immunosuppressive drugs.
Bismuth subsalicy late products. Concomitant use of mesalamine with bismuth 
subsalicylate can lead to salicy late over dosage.
5.5.3. Permitted During This Study
Mesalamine and rel ated 5 -ASA compounds .
Oral steroids through the Week 24 visit .
Stable doses of statins.
Any drugs or classes of drugs not listed in the Prohibited During This Study  
(Section 5.5.2).
5.5.4. Tapering of Corticoster oids
Steroids should be tapered slowly  per local guidelines in all subjects entering the OLE 
in 
remission or with a clinical ly significant response.  Subjects who have not achieved a clinical 
response in the induction study , should begin tapering when they achieve remission or a 
clinically  significant response and should be off steroids if possible by  Week 40 (Week 16 + 
24Weeks) .  Subjects 
unable to taper should be considered treatment failures.

A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
5.5.5. Oral Corticosteroid Rescue Therapy
Oral corticosteroids (max of 1mg/kg) may  be administered for rescue but the subjects should be 
tapered off steroids within 12weeks. Similarly  budesonide up to 9 mg may be used. Typicall y 
9mg of budesonide is given over 8 weeks and then reduced to 6 mg for 2 weeks and then 3 mg 
for 2 weeks and then stopped.
Alternate tapering regimens may  be used as long as the duration for an individual rescue 
treatment does not exceed 12 weeks. 
Subjects unable to taper or who relapse within 2 months should be considered treatment failures 
and should withdraw from active treatment and enter the follow- up phase. Similarly , if subjects 
require IV steroids, they  will be considered treatment failures. 
Beyond 2 months, three additional course of oral corticosteroid rescue therapy  as described 
above will be allowed. 
5.6.Permitted D uring Follow -up
Subjects may  receive IV steroids and other previously  prohibited rescue therapies during the 
follow -up period. Within 6 months of the last dose of investigational product , other 
immunosuppressants should be used with caution since the investigational product will still be 
present for up to 6 months from the last dose. Biologic therapies should not be started without 
discussion with the sponsor.  
6.STUDY PROCEDURES
Refer to the Schedule of Activity (SOA) for a detailed list of study  procedures as they  should be 
conducted at each respective visit.
6.1. Visit 1, Baseline
Visit 1, Baseline for this study  refers to the Week-
12visit date of the A7281009 study . 
Therefore, Week 12 visit date of the A7281009 study  = Visit 1, Baseline of A7281010.
Most e valuations/assessments obtained at the Week-
12 visits of the A7281009 study , will serve 
as baseline evaluations in this extension study and will not need to be repe ated or entered into the 
eCRFs.  No blood or urine samples will be collected for the baseline visit of this study  unless 
there is a need to repeat a safet y laboratory test or tests.  Source documentation supporting d ata 
from evaluations/assessments from th e previous studies may be used as data for the Baseline 
visit in this study , but this data must be included in the subject file and source documentation for 
this study .
The I CD for this study  must be signed and dated before protocol- related procedures are 
performed.  Data transferred from the feeder study and recorded on the appropriate CRF will be 
captured after the ICD is signed.  All baseline procedures and te ststhatmust be completed at this 
visit must be completed prior to administration of the open-l abel investigational product .
The following procedures will be performed at the Baseline visit of this study :

6.4.Early Withdrawal
Subjects may  withdraw from this study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, behavioral, or 
administrative reasons. Subjects must be withdrawn if they  develop an y opportunistic infection, 
eg,PML. Subjects are encouraged to stay  in the protocol unless disease sy mptoms become 
intolerable, as lack of response may  be due to the pharmacokinetic/pharmaco dynamic 
characteristics of the study drug.
Subjects who request to discontinue study  treatment will remain in the study  and must continue 
to be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures.  The onl y exception to this is when a 
subject specifically withdraws consent for any  further contact.  Subjects should notify  the 
investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up in writing, whenever 
possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records b ythe 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study  drug onl y or also 
from study  procedures and/or post treatment study  follow -up.  
Additional reasons a subject may  be withdrawn from active treatment include but are not li mited 
to, AE, SAE, protocol violations, and failure to return for visits. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
subject. All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and repor t their 
ongoing status.  This includes follow -up with persons authorized by  the subject.  L ost to follow -
up is defined b y the inability  to reach the subject after a minimum of three documented phone 
calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by  subject to one registered mail letter.  All 
attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records.  If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.  
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 77
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
The site staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information.  If after all attempts, the 
subject remains lost to follow- up, then the last known alive date as determined by  the 
investigator should be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records. In an y 
circumstance, every  effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The 
investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal , reque st the subject to return for a 
final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding an y unresolved AE(s).
Subjects who withdraw from this study  due to an increase in disease s ymptoms may  see their 
personal ph ysician for treatment, which may include treatments prohibited during the study . 
Subjects that do withdraw from active treatment should complete the procedures for the earl y 
withdrawal visit listed below, and enter the 6 month follow up period of the protocol.
The following procedures w ill be performed at the Earl y Withdrawal Visit prior to Visit 37:
Vital signs
: single sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, weight (lbs or kg) (see 
Section 7.2.1 ).
Review ECHO/Cardiology  Consult if applicabl e (see Section 7.2.4).
Targeted ph ysical examination: To include confrontational visual fields for neurologic 
assessment (see Section 7.2.2.2).
Single, st andard 12 -
lead electrocardiogram (see Section 7.2.3).

urinaly sis (see SOA andSection 7.2.5 and).
Note: if NTproBNP >300 pg/mL order repeat NTproBNP, ECHO and cardiology  consult 
prior to Visit 20; if NTproBNP >124 pg/mL , and subject has previousl y had an ECHO, 
order ECH O and cardiology  consult prior to Visit 20 
Urine pregnancy  test (see Section 7.2.5 and Table 3).
Pharmacokinetics : PF-00547659 , ADAs and NAbs (see Section 7and SOA ).
Complete SCCAI  (see Section 7.4, Appendix 2, and SOA ) .
Collect stool samp le for enteric pathogens only if symptomatic (See Section 7.3.2).
Complete Stool Diary  (see Section 7.4, Appendix 3, and SOA ) .
Neurological Assessments: Timed 25 -Foot Walk (T25FW), 9- Hole Peg Test (9 -HPT), 
Symbol Digit Modality  Test (SDMT), and Multiple Sclerosis Neurops ychological 
Questionnaire (MSNQ) (see Section 7.3.1 and SOA ).
JC virus DNA sample (see Section 7.3.1.6).
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 78

JC virus Antibody  testing (see Section 7.3.1.6).
Monitoring of adverse events
: as described in the Adverse Event, Serious Adverse Event 
Recording and Reporting Sections (see Section 8.14.1 and the SOA ).
Concomitant treatment : as described in the Concomitant Treatment s Sections (see 
Section 5.5and the SOA ). 
End of study  CRF is completed when subjects withdraw from the study .
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
colle cted. The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such withdrawal 
of consent.
6.4.1. Post-Withdrawal Visit
Results from study  A7281001 indicated the elimination of PF -00547659 follows IgG2 
pharmacokinetics when dosed in the range selected from the current study . It has been 
determined that at 24 weeks after the last dose the majority  of subjects are likely  to have 
concentrations below the limit of quantification. Therefore, it is advised that subjects 
withdrawing from the study  prior to W eek144enter into the follow -up period with their first 
follow -up visit occurring 3 months after their last dose .
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform 
the test.  I n these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary  to ensure the safety  and well 
being of the subject.  When a protocol required test can not be performed the investigator will 
document the reason for this and an y corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to 
ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The study  team will be 
informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.
7.1.Pregnancy Testing
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy  test, with sensitivity  of at least 
25mIU/mL, will be performed before investigational product administr ation at the baseline visit 
and at the end of treatment visit.  A negative pregnancy  result is required before the subject may  
receive the investigational product.  Pregnancy  tests will also be done whenever one menstrual 
cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy  is otherwise 
suspected), repeated at all visits , follow -up visit and earl y withdrawal to confirm the subject has 
not become pregnant during the stud y.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request of 
IRB/IECs or if required by  local regulations.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 79
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy , the subject will be withdrawn from study  
medication ,should complete the procedures for the earl y withdrawal visit and enter the 6 month 
follow -up period.
7.2.Safety
Aver age monthly  blood sampling volume for a subject that completes all currentl y scheduled 
assessments through Week 168is approximately  33mL.  
7.2.1.
Vital Signs, Height, and Weight
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, res pirations and oral or tympanic tempera ture(C or F) 
will be measured at every stud y visit up to Visit 19.  After Visit 19, vital signs (blood pressure 
and heart rate) will be measured at every  study  visit. Additional collection times, or changes to 
collection times of blood pressure and pul se rate will be permitted, as necessary , to ensure 
appropriate collection of safet y data.
It is preferred that bod y temperature be collected using the t ympanic or oral methods and that the 
same method be used consistently  throughout 
this study .
Sitting blo od pressure will be measured with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the heart, 
and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  It is preferred that the same arm (preferably  the dominant 
arm) will be used throughout this study .
The same size blood pressure cu ff, which has been properl y sized and calibrated, will be used to 
measure blood pressure each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring blood pressure 
(BP) and pulse rate are acceptable, although, when done manuall y, pulse rate will be measured in 
the brachial/radial artery  for at least 30 seconds.  When the timing of these measurements 
coincides with a blood collection, all vital signs should be obtained prior to the nominal time of 
the blood collection.
Height (inches or centimeters) will be recor ded at the B aseline visit only.  
Weight (lbs or kg) 
without shoes will be measured at each visit, and at Early  Withdrawal (see 
STUDY PROCEDURES ).
7.2.2. Physical Exam
7.2.2.1. Complete Physical Exam
Complete phy sical examinations will be performed at the Baseline visit, Weeks 20, 40, 60, and 
72, if required (see Table 1andSection 6).  Complete phy sical examinations must be performed 
by the investigator, sub -
investigator, or a qualified health professional per local guidelines.  
Complete phy sical examinations consist of assessments of general appearance; skin; head, eyes, 
ears, nose and throat (HEENT); heart; lungs; breast (optional); abdomen; external genitalia
(optional) ; extremities; neurologic function; back and lymph nodes.

PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
7.2.2.2. Targeted Physical Exam
Targeted phy sical ex aminations will be performed at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 44, 48, 
52, 56, 64, and 68during Open Label Treatment Period 1. Targeted ph ysical examination will 
be performed at each visit during Open Label Treatment Period
2 until EOS (Week 168), a nd at 
Early Withdrawal .
(see Table 1andSection 6).  Targeted ph ysical examinations must be 
performed b y investigator, sub
-investigator, or a qualified health professional per local 
guidelines and should include skin, heart, lung, confrontational visual fields (ey es) and abdomen. 
7.2.3. Electrocardiogram
Single 12- lead ECGs should be collected at the Baseline visit , every  8weeks to Week 72. After 
Week 72, a single 12 -lead ECG should be collected starting at Week 84 , every  12weeks to 
Week 144and at Week 168 or Early Withdrawal (if required) (see Table 1andSection 6).
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly  for at least 
10minutes in a 
sitting position.
The values of the ECG collected at the B aseline visit will serve as ea ch subject’s baseline ECG
values.  When the timing of the measurements coincides with a blood collection, the ECG should 
be obtained prior to the nominal time of the blood collection, blood pressure and pulse rate. To 
ensure safet y of the subjects, a qual ified individual (e g,sub-investigator) at the investigator site 
will make comparisons to baseline measurements.
In some cases, it may  be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.
7.2.4. Transthoracic Echocardiogram (ECHO) and Cardiology Consult (if applicable)
ECHO and cardiology  consult will be performed locally  only under specifi ed conditions. These 
conditions are:
At baseline visit: if NTproBNP value is >300 pg/mL  if no prior ECHO .
At the 
on-treatment visits up to Week 144: If no prior ECHO, the first time NTproBNP is 
>300 pg/mL .
At the Week144or early withdrawal visit: I f there has been an y prior ECHO AND the 
NTproBNP is >124 pg/mL or if there has been no prior ECHO, and the NTproBNP is 
>300 pg/mL .
At the 
post-week 144visits: if there has been no prior ECHO and NTproBNP is >300.
At a minimum, the ECHO must assess RV and LV fu
nction, determine LVEF and evaluate for 
diastolic dy sfunction.
The cardiology  consult should be focused on any  evidence of my ocarditis or right or left heart 
failure or an y alternative explanations of the subject’s elevated NTproBNP. The cardiologist 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 81
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
should review the serial NTproBNP data available up to that point, and the ECHO, and provide a 
report that evaluates the etiology  of the heart failure or m yocarditis if present.
7.2.5. Laboratory Tests
As much as possible, only 1 local laboratory  should be used by  each investigator for all local 
laboratory  tests. Laboratory  certification and laboratory  normal ranges must be provided to the 
sponsor for all laboratories used. A central laboratory  will be used for the majority  of the 
laboratory  tests; how ever a local l aboratory  will be allowed for urgent test results if needed.
Laboratory  tests are 
listed in detail in Table 1andSection 6.
All laboratory  tests with values that become abnormal to a clinically  significant degree after 
investigational product administrati on must be repeated and the investigator must continue to 
follow up as medicall y indicated until values have returned to baseline or until the condition 
stabilizes. If laboratory  values do not return to normal or baseline within a reasonable period, the 
etiology  must be identified and the sponsor notified.

7.3. Special Safety Assessments
As noted above (see Section 1.2.4.1) nonselective inhibitors of ly mphocy te trafficking into 
tissue ,such as natalizumab ,
have been associated with rare cases of Progressive M ultifocal 
Leukoencephalopath y (PML). Because PF -00547659 acts only  on the MAdCAM receptor , 
which is the mediator of ly mphocy te trafficking into the gut, this agent should be much safer 
because it does not interact with VCAM, the mediator of l ymphocy te tra fficking into the CNS. It 
is hy pothesized that natalizumab interferes with immune surveillance of the CNS, thus 
permitting opportunistic infections. However, the actual mechanism by  which natalizumab 
therap y results in PML  is unknown.
Since PF -
00547659 i s still in early development, in order to maximally  protect study  subjects 
from an y potential neurologic risk, this study includes frequent neurologic assessments to detect 
the earliest possible changes in neurologic function. Any change in function detec ted b y this 
assessment should trigger an immediate neurologic consultation to rule out PML .
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 83
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
The tests selected for assessment were identified by  expert consultation as the rarit y of PML has 
prevented the establishment of clear -cut guidelines for its earl y detection. Since PML  and 
Multiple S clerosis (MS) are both white matter diseases, similar findings are expected. Therefore, 
many  of the chosen tests are used frequently  to assess MS subjects . 
Because none of these tests has been validated for this specif ic purpose, the investigator’s 
clinical judgment will be necessary  in the interpretation of changes that will trigger an immediate 
formal neurological consultation to determine the cause of the change in neurological function 
and exclude PML . Such a consultation will ty pically  include MRI and lumbar puncture.  
The following neurological assessments will be performed monthly  throughout the Open Label 
Treatment Period 1 and Open Label Treatment Period 2 :
Confrontational Visual Fields which will be performed as part of the ph ysical exam .
Timed 25-Foot Walk.
9-Hole Peg Test (9 -HPT) .
Symbol Digit Modality  Test (SDMT -written) .
Patient
-Multiple Sclerosis Neurops ychological Questionnaire (MSNQ) (Does not trigger 
a neurology  consult).
7.3.1. Neurological Assessments
These tests are rapid , simple to perform and may  be performed by  the study site staff after 
reading the simple instructions.  Additional training in these tests will be provided at the 
investigator meeting.
7.3.1.1. Confrontational Visual Fields (to be performed as part of the complete and 
Targeted Physical examinations)
Confrontation Visual Field Test (CVFT): The CVFT is a basic screening tool to measure the 
overall field of vision.  It is also useful for detecting blind spots and ey e diseases.  Subjects will 
be asked t o cover one eye while fixing their gaze on the examiner’s ey es.  This test should be 
administered b y a qualified health professional trained in confrontational visual fields. The 
examiner will make finger movements, bringing his/her fingers into each quad rant of the visual 
field.  Subjects will be asked how man y fingers they see without actually looking at them in 
order to test peripheral vision.  (See Appendix 4for instructions).  
Any change in visual fields detected by  this examination must trigger a f ormal visual field 
examination by  an ophthalmologist.  If the visual field test is abnormal then a neurologic 
consultation to rule out PML  must be initiated immediately .

7.3.1.2. Timed 25-Foot Walk
Timed 25
-Foot Walk (T25 -FW): The T25- FW is a quantitative mobility  and leg function test 
based on a timed 25 foot walk.  The subject is directed to walk to one end of a clearl y marked 
25-foot straight course.  The subject is instructed to wal k as quickly  as possible, but safely .  The 
examiner uses a stopwatch to time how long it takes the subject to walk to the 25
-foot mark.  The 
task is immediately  administered again b y having the subject walk back to the start of the 25 -foot 
course.  Subject smay use assistive devices when doing this task.  The average time of the two 
trials is taken.  Total administration time should be approximately  1-5minutes.  (see Appendix 5
for instructions).
Note: This test requires a stopwatch, a measuring tape (at l east 25 feet long), and masking tape 
to mark the floor are needed.  
In a study  of normal volunteers, the t ypical time to complete the 25 foot walk was 3-4 seconds, 
in contrast to patients with 
Multiple Sclerosis who took about twice as long.9Arthritis a nd other 
orthopedic problems can also affect the time on the test. 
A 20% increase compared with baseline of the previous study is clinically significant and 
deterioration not explained by another clear reason should prompt a neurological 
consultation. Note the term baseline is not defined as the “baseline visit”. To further 
clarify “the baseline” value is the WORSE of the values determined at the screening visit 
and baseline visit of study A7281009.

7.3.1.3. 9- Hole Peg Test (9 -HPT)
9Hole Peg Test: The 9 -HPT is a brief, standardized test of upper limb function.  Both the 
dominant and non -dominant hands are tested (note: dominant hand is usually  the h and that the 
patient uses to write).  The subject is seated at a table with a small, shallow container containing 
9
pegs and a wooden or plastic block with 9 empty holes.  On a start command when a stopwatch 
is started, the subject picks up the 9 pegs one peg at a time, and as quickl y as possible, puts the 
pegs in the holes.  Once all the pegs are in the holes the patient removes them again as quickl y as 
possible, one at a time, replacing them into the shallow container.  The total time to complete the 
taskis recorded.  Two consecutive trials with the dominant hand are immediately  followed by  
two consecutive trials with the non-dominant hand.  The average time for each hand is 
calculated.  Total administration time should be approximately  10minutes or less. 
Note :this test requires a stopwatch.   
In a study  of healthy  volunteers, t ypical completion time was about 18 seconds, compared with 
Multiple Sclerosis patients who required 21 -25 seconds.9Performance of the test can also be 
affected b y injuries and arthritis. 
A 20% increase compared with baseline of the previous study is clinically significant along 
with deterioration in performance that is not readily explained especially if within the MS

the “baseline visit”. To further clarify “the baseline” value is the WORSE of the values 
determined at the screening visit and baseline visit of study A7281009.

7.3.1.4. Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT)
Symbol Digit Modality  Test (SDMT): The SDMT is a simple test used to screen for organic 
cerebral d ysfunction.  I t evaluates multi ple domains, including attention, visual spanning and 
motor speed. The SDMT is brief, eas y to administer, and has demonstrated sensitivity  in 
detecting not only  the presence of brain damage but also changes in cognitive functioning over 
time and in respon se to treatment.  The SDMT involves a simple substitution task such as in 
deciphering a code.  Using a reference key , the subject has 90 seconds to pair specific numbers 
with given geometric figures.  Subjects can give either written or verbal responses.  The written 
version is being used in this study . Time to administer is approximately  5minutes.  
Results of the SDMT are compared against a normative table that indicates values for 
populations by  age and educational level (12 years of school/high school graduate or less vs 
13years of school/an y college or more). Scores are ranked in terms of standard deviation, from 
+3.0 to - 3.0 in 0.5 SD increments. When given a single time, a value that is -1SD is considered 
low, -1.5 SD moderatel y low, and -2.0SDvery low. There has been no validation of change 
over time, but in a study  of impaired patients (baseline no more than -1.5SD) with Multiple 
Sclerosis with an ineffective treatment both the placebo and treated patients varied b y 
4.8-5.2 points over 28 days.10The minimum change to reflect 1 SD is 8 points. 
A deterioration  1 standard deviation on two consecutive visits compared to the baseline of 
the previous study and a drop in performance should be of concern and prompt a 
neurological consultation. Note the term baseline is not defined as the “baseline visit”. To 
further clarify “the baseline” value is the WORSE of the values determined at the 
screening visit and baseline visit of study A7281009.

7.3.1.5. Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Questionnaire (MSNQ)
Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsy chological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ): The MSNQ is a 
self-administered PRO questionnaire. It is designed as a quick test to identify  possible 
neurops ychological impairment, originall y in subjects with Multiple Sclerosis.  The MSNQ has 
15questions, and subjects rate the frequency  and severit y of s ymptoms associated with 
neurops ychological impa irment.  There are 2 MSNQ; one for patients and one for a close family  
member or friend. Both forms are reliable and valid. However, only  the patient form will be 
used in this study . 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 86
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
The MSNQ is a sensitive test for detection of neurocognitive abnormalit ies in patients with MS .  
The test covers several different cognitive domains (attention, memory , language) and integrates 
them into a single value. Patients with MS scored significantl y higher than normal controls on 
the self -reported values. 
Self-repo rt (m ean+/ -sd)
MS 27.4+/ -11.9
Normal 16.0+/ -6.2
For self -reported results, a cut- off of 24 correctly  identified cognitive impairment 68% of the 
time (sensitivity 0.83, specificit y0.6).
Experience with this test is generally limited to subjects with mu ltiple sclerosis. Based on 
early experience with Crohn’s Disease subjects, variability between repeat tests appears 
excessive and results are being evaluated for information only.
Refer to Appendix 8for instructions.
7.3.1.6. JC Virus
Samples for JC virus antibody will be taken every  6months throughout the study  until the final 
onsite visit. At a minimum, the final samples will be tested. The samples may  be stored with the 
central shipper until an appropriate anal ysis plan is determined.
Samples for JC Virus DNA will be taken every  6months throughout the study  until the final 
onsite visit. At a minimum, the final samples may be tested. The shipment address and contact 
information for the lab will be provided to the Investigator as soon as this information will 
become available. The samples may  be stored with the central shipper until an appropriate 
analysis plan is determined.
7.3.2. C. Difficile
Highl y sensitive tests, with high negative predictive value, should be employ ed to exclude 
C.difficile infection in subjec ts with a flare of UC. The detection of C. difficile by toxigenic 
stool culture [stool culture followed b y detection of toxin] is considered the gold standard for the 
diagnosis of the colonization or infection with pathogenic C. difficile .Comparable sen
sitivity  
may be achieved by  direct testing of stool via point of use rapid membrane enzy me 
immunoassay  card for both C. difficile toxin A and B and glutamate deh ydrogenase (GDH) 
antigen on a card.   Use of the card for point of care is encouraged where perm itted by  local 
regulation.
  Molecular techniques such as PCR for detection of toxin RNA are also acceptable 
alternatives. This test will be mandatory for subjects who experience a disease flare.
Refer to the lab manual for further guidance and instruction for C. difficile testing .

7.4.Diagnostic and Efficacy Assessments
7.4.1. Flexible Sigmoidoscopy or Colonoscopy (if preferred)
A flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscop y must be performed at stud y Visit 5 (Week 16). 
Additionally , between Weeks 52 and 68, if routine colonoscop y for cancer surveillance is 
performed within the study  a Total May o score should be obtained. Optional 
colonoscopies/flexible sigmoidoscop y performed between W eeks 40 and 72will provide 
additional Total May o Score for exploratory  anal ysis. If it is necessary  a bowel prep should be 
conducted as per local routine.  The position of the endoscope at the post -treatment visit will be 
based on the length of the instrument at various levels of insertion as well as the morphological 
features of the intestine as seen during flexible sigmoidoscopy  or colonoscopy  at baseline.  The 
endoscop y report and any photographs and/or video recordings taken during the procedure per 
local custom should be filed in the patient’s chart.  The findings of the endoscopy comp onent 
should be completed at the end of the procedure to document the endoscopic subscore in the 
event that the data is entered at a different location.
A cop y of the endoscop y report and an y photographs and/or video recordings taken during the 
procedure m ust be obtained and filed in the subject’s chart and must be available to the sponsor 
upon request.  The report and an y photographs and/or video recordings taken during the 
procedure must be sufficient to complete the endoscopy  component on the May o Scorin g System 
CRF.  A request should also be made to obtain any biops y samples that were taken during the 
procedure.
To ensure measurement consistency  and validit y of study  efficacy  assessments, video recordings 
of endoscopic procedures will be captured using a study -specific video capture kit and uploaded 
to a secure website for review by  a central reader.
Scoring will be performed by  the central reader at Week 16 of the study . Scores will be returned 
to the investigative sites in a timely  manner. Site personnel will be trained on the video capture 
equipment suppliedby  the central reading CRO and instructed on how to upload the video 
recording data. 
Precautions will be taken to ensure confidentiality . The central reader will remain blinded to the 
study  as no information regarding disease history  or treatments is to be communicated from the 
sites.
7.4.2. Optional Endoscopic Biopsy Substudy
Only  for subjects who consent during flexible sigmoidoscopy  or colonoscopy  (whichever 
preferred). The anal ysis may  include the following:
mRNA (all sites):
The largest standard forceps should be used to obtain biopsies.  Biopsies should be taken 
one-at-a-time, and each should be immediately  placed into a separate sample collection tube.  
The biopsy  collection tube will contain an RN A stabilizing liquid.  For RNA biopsies should be 
taken from abnormally  lesional mucosa, and biopsies from non lesionsal mucosa.  The biops y 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 88
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
must be completely  submerged in the liquid. Labels should clearl y specify whether the biops y is 
from a lesional or non-lesional area.  Frankly  ulcerated areas should be avoided.  Shire and the 
central laboratory  vendor will provide sites with instructions and supplies for the collection, 
processing, and shipment of biopsy  samples.
Assessment of Histology (all sites):
These biopsies are being collected for the purposes of assessing the effectiveness of drug in 
decreasing inflammatory  cell infiltration at the site of disease. Histological and protein 
assessment 
may include different subsets of ly mphocy tes, hematopoietic cells and/or protein 
biomarkers and will be performed on formalin fixed tissue.  The largest standard forceps should 
be used to obtain biopsies.  Biopsies should be taken one- at-a-time. Biopsies from lesional tissue 
should be placed in the container provid ed (which contains formalin).  Additionally , biopsies 
from non-lesional mucosa should be placed in the separate contained (also containing formalin.  
Labels should clearly  specify  whether the biopsies are from inflamed or normal appearing 
mucosa.  Frankl y ulcerated areas should be avoided.  Shire and the central laboratory
 vendor will 
provide sites with instructions and supplies for the collection, processing, and shipment of biopsy 
samples.
Mucosal Healing (all sites):
Subjects may  undergo endoscopy  to eva luate mucosal healing b y visualization.  Data may  be 
combined with the data from the other MAdCAM IBD studies. Endoscopic scoring will be 
performed using the Mayo -Score. The procedures may  also be recorded on CD -ROMs.
Tissue Biology (SELECTED SITES):
The o bjective of this study  is to explore the effect of PF -00547659 on endoscopic tissue. 
Approximately  40 subjects are needed for meaningful data. Data may  be combined with the data 
from the other MAdCAM IBD studies.
The anal ysis may  include the following:
T and B l ymphocy tes to be isolated from LMPC’s (obtained from intestinal biopsies) and 
subsequently  subjected to FACS anal ysis that may  include using antibodies against B7, 
CD45 RO, CD27, CCR6, CCR9, CD3 and CD19/CD10.
Histologic disease activity.
Immunohistochemistry  (IHC) that may  include different subsets of l ymphocy tes, 
hematopoietic cells and/or protein biomarkers.
mRNA transcripts.
Additional information may  be provided in the laboratory  manual under separate cover.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 89
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
Individual subjects may also elect to participate or not in this portion of the study  without 
affecting their overall eligibility  for the study .  
7.4.3. Subject Stool Diary
Subjects will use a paper diary in order to record on a daily  basis the following information 
during the stud y:
‘Normal’ number of stools per day  (when not having a flare).  
Number of times need to visit the toilet to have a bowel movement (per day).
Presence of blood in the stools (if any ).
Description of blood in the stools (if an y).
Patients will be required to enter diary  data for the 3 day s immediatel y preceding the flexible
sigmoidoscop y visit prior to the Week 16visit. Note: The term “immediately” indicates a 
preference and is not considered a requirement. To calculate the Mayo Score data, 3 consecutive 
days preceding the flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy may be used. Should any  patient be
required to perform bowel preparation prior to the flexible sigmoidoscopy  at Week 16,the 
patient should be instructed to complete the diary  one day  prior to initiating bowel prepara tion. 
Note: If a bowel preparation is needed data for 3 consecutive days up to one day prior to the 
bowel preparation may be used to calculate the Mayo Score. Diaries to be completed by  the 
patients will be distributed during the baseline visit [Week 12 of study  A7281009 (for collection 
at 
the flexible sigmoidoscopy  visit prior to Week 16)] (See Appendix 3).
7.4.4. Mayo Score
The May o score is a tool designed to measure disease activit y for UC.  The Mayo scoring s ystem 
ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of 4 subscores, each graded 0 to 3 with the higher score 
indicating more severe disease activity  (see Appendix 1).
Stool frequency  (Subscore 0
-3).
Rectal bleeding (Subscore 0 -3).
Findings on flexible sigmoidoscopy  (Subscore 0- 3).
Physician’s global assessment (Subscore 0- 3).
Calculation of the May o score requires an assessment of the subject’s stool frequency  and an y 
amount of blood in the stool. The May o score at baseline and Week 16visit will be calculated 
based on the subject’s diary  data recorded over the 3prior consecutive days.
The May o endoscopic subscore will be assessed by  the mucosal appearance during the flexible 
sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy based on the scoring s ystem provided in the protocol 
(Appendix 1). The endoscopic appearance will be read b y both the investigator and central 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 90
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
reader. Centrall y read endoscopic subscores will be used for both eligibility and efficacy 
analyses.
The phy sician’s global assessment (PGA) acknowledges the other three criteria, the subject’s 
abdominal discomfort and sense of general well- being. In addition, the investigator should 
consider other observations (ie, physical findings) and subject’s performance status when making 
the PGA assessment. It is preferred that the same phy sician performs all such assessments fo r a 
given subject throughout the study .
7.4.5. Partial Mayo Score
A partial May o score (May o score without the endoscopic subscore) will be assessed prior to the 
administration of the investigational product and at the specified stud y visits in the SOA .
7.4.6. Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI)
The SCCAI  measures disease activity  as defined by  both subjects and examiners and includes the 
following 13 items: general well -being, abdominal pain, bowel fr equency , stool consistency , 
bleeding, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, abdominal tenderness, extra intestinal complications 
(eye, mouth, joint, skin), temperature, sigmoidoscopic assessment, nocturnal bowel movements, 
and urgency  of defecation .7Scores range from 0 to 19 points, and scores <2.5 have been shown 
to correlate with Patient- Defined Remission, and a decrease of >1.5 points from baseline 
correlates with Patient -Defined Significant Improvement.8  SCCAI  will be administered by  study  
site personnel and will reflect a subject’s self- assessment of the prior 24 -hour period. Scores will 
be obtained prior to the first dose of study  treatment at baseline. Subsequent SCCAI  assessments 
will occur throughout the treatment period prior to the performance of an yother study  
procedures (See Appendix 2).
7.5.Pharmacokinetics
7.5.1. Serum Samples for Analysis of PF -
00547659
Blood samples for the assessment of PF-00547659 will be collected and analy zed at the specified
time points for the duration of the study  at protocol -speci fied times (See Schedule of Activities ).
Samples will be analy zed for PF -00547659 using a validated assay .Follow Section 7.7for 
serum harvest procedure.
Samples will be analy zed using a validated anal ytical method in compliance with Shire standard 
operating procedures.
Collection tube labels must include the following preprinted information: protocol number, 
subject number, treatment period, study  day, and nominal time of sample withdrawal as well as 
the test identification ‘PF-00547659/serum’.

7.6. Pharmacodynamics
7.6.1. hsCRP 
Highl y sensitive C reactive protein (hs CRP) is a highl y sensitive inflammation biomarker.  hs 
CRP will be measured through regularl y scheduled safet y laboratory  serum samples as specified 
in the Ta ble1andSection 6.
7.6.1.1. Shipment of Samples for Analysis of hs CRP
The shipment address and contact information for the lab will be provided to the I nvestigator site 
prior to initiation of the trial.
7.6.2. Fecal Calprotectin
Fecal calprotectin (a neutrophil degrada tion product) is a second inflammation biomarker that 
will be anal yzed.  Stool samples for fecal calprotectin measurements will be obtained through 
stool samples collected at baseline through Week 24, W eek32, and Week 72 as specified in 
Table 1andSection 6.  Stool samples for fecal calprotectin should be collected at the specified 
study  visit. Labe
led stool containers and plastic bags will be provided to the subjects at the 
preceding visit so they  can bring the stool specimen with them at that visit. While it is preferred 
to provide a fresh specimen, it will not interfere with testing if the stool is refrigerated or frozen. 
If the subject fails to bring in the stool specimen, they  should stay  at the site and provide it the 
day of the visit if at all possible or at the earliest possible time.
Note : Fecal calprotectin will be collected from subjects who were pr eviously  in study  A7281009 
only.
7.6.2.1. Shipment of Fecal Samples for Analysis Fecal Calprotectin
The shipment address and contact information for the lab will be provided to the I nvestigator site

During all trial sessions, blood samples (2 mL) to provide a minimum of 1 mL of serum for the 
analysisof anti-PF-00547659 antibodies will be collected at the time points specified in the 
Table 1andSection 6.  
Samples will be analy zed using a validated anal ytical method in compl iance with Shire standard 
operating procedures.  A positive ADA sample will be further tested for neutralizing antibodies.
Collection tube labels must include the following preprinted information: protocol number, 
subject number, treatment period, study  day, and nominal time of sample withdrawal as well as 
the test identification ‘ADA/serum’.
7.7.1.1. Shipment of Serum Samples for Analysis of Anti -drug Antibodies
The shipment address and contact information for the lab will be provided to the I nvestigator site 
prior to initiation of the trial.
7.8.
Procedure for Serum Collection
During all trial periods, blood samples will be collected into appropriatel y labeled vacuum tubes 
containing no additive glass tube (the silicone coated plastic tube is acceptable if 
non-additive glass red top tube is not available) at times specified in the protocol.  A serum 
separator tube should not be used.
Blood samples will be allowed to clot at room temperature (18C-25C) for at least 
30minutes for a complete clot .  Place the clotted sampl
es into an ice/bath for approximately  
10 minutes prior to the centrifugation.  Serum will be separated from the whole blood within 
approximately  40 minutes of collection.  Specimen should be centrifuged at 1000 to 1200 x g for 
approximately  10 to 15 minute s in an ambient centrifuge (refrigerated centrifuge is acceptable if 
it’s available) to harvest the serum.  After centrifugation, the upper serum lay er is carefully  
transferred with a disposable pipette into a labeled screw capped plastic storage tube.  Sa mple 
should be re centrifuged immediately  if red blood cells are inadvertentl y drawn into the serum.  
Serum samples will be frozen in an upright position at approximately  -20°C or colder within 
60minutes of sample collection.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adver se Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following sections.
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain informa tion adequate both to determine the 
outcome of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE
requiring immediate notification to Shire or its designated representative.  For all AEs, sufficient 
information should be obtaine d by the investigator to determine the causality  of the AE.  The 
investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  the investigator may be required until 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 93
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, an d Shire
concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y nonserious AEthat is 
determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported by the Sponsor as an SAE.  To assist in 
the determination of case seriousne ss further information may  be requested from the investigator 
to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical trial.
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAE s, the active reporting period to Shire or its designated representative begins fr om the 
time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or receiving 
investigational product, through and including the End of Stud y visit .  SAEs occurring to a 
subject after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the 
investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all 
SAE s that the investigator believes have 
at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be reported to 
the Sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the subject 
has taken at least 1 dose of investigational product through the subject’s last visit.
8.3.Definit ion of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse ;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include t he signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 94
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error ;
Occupational exposure
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication error may result, in this study , from the administration of the wrong product, to the
wrong subject, atthe 
wrong time, per the wrong route, wrong administration location, or at the 
wrong dosage strength, due to human error.  Medication errors include overdose (acc idental or 
intentional).  Such medication errors occurring to a study  participant are to be captured on the 
medication error case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) 
page, and on the SAE form when appropriate. In the eve nt of medication dosing error, the 
sponsor should be notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product.
Potent ial medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or 
do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, as determined by  the investigator, 
the medicati on error is captured on the medication error version of the adverse event (AE) page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captu red on an AE CRF page .
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
adverse event are as follows:
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing or discontinuation from this study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y, and/or
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 95
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
Test result is considered to be an adverse event b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not
constitute an adverse event.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not 
require reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi talization or prolongation of existing hos pitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an 
important medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  
life-threatening and/or result in death or hos pitalization.   However, if it is determined that 
the event may  jeopardize the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the 
other adverse event outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatmen t in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hos
pitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified S AEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported by  the investigator 
as described in previous sections and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y database (see the 
section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver I njury
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotrans ferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined 
below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are con sidered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered important 
medical events.  
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to definitively  
determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 96
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
Subjects with AST or ALT and tota l bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL Tvalues 3 times the upper limit of normal 
(XULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value  2 X ULN with no evidence of 
hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value 2X ULN or not available.
For subjects with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper 
limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned 
above:
For subjects with pre -existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT values 2times the baseline values and 3 XULN, or 
8 XULN (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased from baseline b y an amount of at least 1 X ULN or if the 
value reaches  3X ULN (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total 
bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubi n, gamma -glutamyl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/
international normalized ratio ( INR)and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , including 
relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and 
supplement consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel history , 
history  of contact with a jaundiced person , surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic 
disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepat itisA, B, or C 
infection and liver imaging ( eg,biliary  tract) may  be warranted.  
All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria, defined above with no 
other cause for 
liver function test ( LFT)abnormalities identified at the time should be considered 
potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations 
performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should 
be reported as serious adverse events.
8.7.Hospi talization
Hosp italization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility  or any  prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric wing 
to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis 
unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily  constitute a hospitalization; however, the 
event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical importance.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 97
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care ( eg,caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeri es (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hos pitalization in the absence of a preci pitating, clinical 
adverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preex isting condition not associated with the development 
of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition ( eg,for work-up 
of persistent pre -treatment lab abnormality );
Social admission ( eg,subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission ( eg,for yearly physical exam);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg,for a procedure required by  the study  
protocol);
Optional admis sion not associated with a precipi tating clinical adverse event ( eg,for 
elective cosmetic surgery);
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should 
not be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the A
E reporting period should be reported as an AE, and 
the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 98
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SE VERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the adverse event.  For 
purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual funct ion.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily  a serious event.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes 
significantl y with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all adverse events (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  asse ssment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event ; 
generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided .  
If the investigator does not know whether or not theinvestigational product caused the event, 
then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the Sponsor (see the 
Section on Reporting Requirements ). If the investigator's 
causality  assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", this should be 
clearl y documented on study  records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study  
procedur es, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event 
reporting requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
All pregn ancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined 
follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.
Any report of pregnancy  for any  female study  participant or the partner of a male study  
participant must be reported withi
n 24 hour s to Shire Global Drug Safet y using the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. A copy  of the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form (and an y applicable follow -up 
reports) must also be sent to the CRO/S hire medical monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact information section of the protocol.  The pregnant female study  participant 
must be withdrawn from the study .
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 99
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnanc y outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately  30 calendar day s postpartum. 
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneou s abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality  
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form 
for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required b y Protocol. Note: An 
elective abortion is not con sidered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event Form for 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AE s as Required b y Protocol as well as the 
Shire I nvestigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. The test date of the first 
positive serum/urine -hCG test or ultrasound result will determine the pregnancy  onset date.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An oc cupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a 
healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which 
may or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposur e is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an associated AE/SAE.  
Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the informati on is not 
reported on a CRF: however, a cop y of the completed SAE report form is maintained in the 
investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also the Section 6.4 on Early Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to adverse events should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes , 
according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate 
adverse event CRF page.
When a subject withdraws because of a serious adv erse event, the serious adverse event must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously  reported by the stud y subject.  In addition, each study subject will be questioned 
about adverse events.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
events.  If a serious adverse eve nt occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international 
regulations, as appropriate.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 100
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be repo rted by  the investigator to Shire Global Drug 
Safety and the CRO/Shire medical monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. In 
addition, any  SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  the 
investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to Shir e Global Drug 
Safety within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.
In particular, if the serious adverse event is f atal or life -threatening, notification to 
Shire must be 
made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available adverse event inform ation.  This 
timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded 
serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during 
pregnancy exposure via breastfeeding and occupational e xposure cases.
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for 
Serious Adverse Event s (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required b y Protocol and verify  the 
accuracy  of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents 
(Note: Source documents are not to be sent unless requested) an d fax or e -mail the form to Shire 
Global Drug Safet y. A copy  of the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required by  Protocol (and an y applicable follow -up 
reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact information section of the protocol.
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious 
adverse event immediately  (eg,if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), 
the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her firs t awareness of the adverse event.
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to 
Shire in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may  be requested by  Shireto obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for serious adverse events is more detailed than 
that captured on the adverse event case report form.  I n general, this will include a description of 
the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and 
independent determination of possible causalit y.  Information on other possible causes of the 
event, such as concomitant medications , vaccines, and/orillnesses must be provided.  In the case 
of a subject death, a summary  of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as 
possible to Shire or its designated representative.
8.14.2. Protocol Specific Medically Important Events
Any unexplained change in neurolo gical status or abnormalities in the neurological assessments 
should prompt a neurological consult
and if appropriate, be reported as an adverse event or 
medically  important event. Events that alread y meet SAE criteria (eg, seizure, stroke) should be 
reported immediatel y (See Section 8.6). If clinically  indicated, an MRI scan and possibly  a 
lumbar puncture for JC virus DNA should be performed to rule ou
t PML  or other causes of the 
neurological findings.  All cases will be reviewed and adjudicated b y the DMC.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 101
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
In case of unexplained neurological signs or s ymptoms consistent with PML, treatment with PF -
00547659 should be halted and further neurological evaluation is required.
8.14.3. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reportin g Requirements
All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  It should be noted 
that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the adverse 
event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent 
manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms.  Adverse 
events should be reported using concise medical terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form 
for collection of serious adverse event information.
8.14.4. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9.
DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  will 
be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be maintained by  the sponsor.  This 
document may  modify  the plans outlined in the prot ocol; however, an y major modifications of 
the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
All eligible subjects, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, from the A7281009 study may be 
enrolled.  It is estimated that approximately  90% of the subjects (about 331subjects) from stud y 
A7281009 are likel y to enroll into this open label extension study A7281010.  The sample size is 
chosen based on clinical outcome of study  A7281009 rathe r than statistical consideration.  
9.2.Exploratory Efficacy Analysis
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the exploratory  efficacy  analy sis. The binary  
endpoints such as clinical remission, clinical response will be summarized with frequency  and 
perce ntage by  time point; and the continuous variables will be summarized with n, mean, 
median, standard deviation etc. These summaries may  be provided by  the strata of responding 
status at ent ry base d on the feeder study . 
All subjects who have received at le ast one dose of planned investigational product in the open 
lable extension study  will be included into the exploraty  efficacy  anal ysis. Detailed 
methodologies of these analy ses will be described in the SAP.
9.3.
Exploratory Pharmacodynamic Analysis
Fecal calprotectin , hsCRP and exploratory  biomarkers will be listed and summarized by  visit, 
and change from baseline for these endpoints will also be summarized at specific time points as 
reported in the SOA . 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 102
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
Appropriate regression models may be used to look at association between these endpoints and 
any covariates of clinical interests. 
Data from the substud y may be combined with biopsy  data from other ongoing MAdCAM 
studies for anal ysis.
9.4.Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Blood samples will be collected prior to dosing for anal ysis of plasma trough concentrations of 
PF-00547659.  Serum concentration data obtained from all subjects in this study  will be 
tabulated and plotted to assess average stead y state concentrat ions following repeat SC dosing of 
PF-00547659.  As subjects enrolled in this study  will have previousl y been followed in a 
separate protocol ( the feeder study
) where more PK sampling may  have been performed, the 
trough PK data collected from this study  may be combined with data from the previous stud y 
(the A7281009 study ) into a single database. 
Presence of anti -PF-00574659 antibodies will be listed and summarized by  time post dose for 
each dose. 
In subjects with a positive ADA, presence of neutralizing antibodies may  be listed and 
summarized by  time post dose for each dose.
9.5.Safety Analysis
Safety  data may  be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis as needed during the study  
since this is an open -label study .  A set of safet y summary  tables will be produced to evaluate 
potential risks associated with the safet y and tolerability of administering the study medication. 
All clinical AEs, SAEs, on-treatment AEs, as well as discontinuations due to AEs will be 
summarized with frequency  and percentage.  Cont inuous outcomes (e g,vitals, safety  lab 
parameters, etc) will be summarized using n, mean, median, standard deviation etc.  Change 
from baseline on selected safet y endpoints may be additionally summarized.  Subject listings 
may also be produced for these s afety endpoints.
The safet y endpoints will be listed and summarized in accordance with Shire Data Standards.  
Detailed methodologies of these analy ses will be described in the SAP.
9.6. Interim Analysis
Two interim anal yses (IAs) may  be performed for this study when 50% of subjects from the 
Phase 2 study  (A7281009) have been enrolled in this study  (A7281010), and the last subject 
from the Phase 2 study  (A7281009) has been enrolled in this study  (A7281010).  The purpose of 
the IA sis to provide additional data on the durability  of response, remission, and safet y from 
A7281009 to facilitate the decision- making process of initiating future studies.  Summary  
statistics for safet y, efficacy as well as subject demographics will be provided at IA.  Detailed 
analysis wil l be described in the SAP. 
Additional interim analy ses may  also be performed when it is deemed necessary  to evaluate 
safet y and efficacy during the trial.

9.7.Data Monitoring Committee 
An external Data Monitoring Committee will be in place to review the safe ty of subjects on an 
ongoing basis and to adjudicate an y subjects with unexplained neurological or cardiac findings.  
Membership of this committee shall include at least one neurologist with expertise in PML  and 
one cardiologist with expertise in heart fai lure and/or my ocarditis. Work -up of such suspected 
PML  cases will include a neurology  consultation as well as an MRI scan, and a lumbar puncture, 
if clinically  indicated.  Additional procedures may be deemed necessary .  Given the lack of 
therapeutic optio ns for subjects who have failed at least 1 conventional therapy , PF-00547659 
with its distinct mechanism of action and known safet y profile appears to have a favorable 
Risk-Benefit profile.  The added precautions regarding PML are probably  unnecessary  but will 
serve to increase the confidence in PF -00547659 for future development.
Additional cardiac monitoring will be implemented in this study .  Serum samples for CPK (with 
reflex isoenzy mes), troponin I and NT -proBNP will be drawn with the safety  labs.  Ele vation of 
troponin I >0.05 ng/mL  or CPK with MB or should prompt a cardiology  consult.  Any  subject 
who experiences an initial on- study  elevation of NTproBNP to >300 pg/mL shall have an 
echocardiogram and cardiology  consult. All subjects who have had an e chocardiogram, in 
whom the NTproBNP remains >124 pg/mL at the 
144week visit, shall have a repeat 
echocardiogram and cardiology  consultation ordered no later than the following visit. All cases 
of on -study  elevation of NTproBNP to >300 pg/mL , elevation in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) or 
CK/MB or new ECG changes will be reviewed b y the DMC.
The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of safet y of subjects in the study  according 
to the Charter.  The recommendations made by  the DMC to alter the conduct of the study  or 
amend the protocol will be forwarded to Shire for final decision.  Shire will forward such 
decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safet y 
data that are not endpoints, to regulatory  authoriti
es, as appropriate.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During stud y conduct, Shire or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the 
protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The monitors may  review source documents to confirm 
that the dat a recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow Shire
monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to 
perform this verification.
The study  site may  be subject to review by  the institutional review board (IRB)/independent 
ethics committee (IEC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  Shire , or companies 
working with or on behalf of Shire
, and/or to inspection by  appropriate regulatory  authorities.
It is important that th e investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEE PING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As us ed in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to either 
a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used 
in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each i ncluded subject.  The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property of Shire and should not be made available in an y form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of Shire or appropriate regulatory  authorities, 
without written permission fro m Shire .
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety  
and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source documents) 
and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic/ori ginal, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, 
timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The CRFs must be signed b y 
the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs is 
true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed 
and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the original entry .
In most cases, the source documents are the hos pital's or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In these 
cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  I n these cases, 
a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Shire and clearly  identify  
those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source 
document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or 
Shire , the investigator agrees 
to keep records, including the id entity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link 
records, eg,CRFs and hos pital records), all original signed informed consent documents , copies 
of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment 
disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e g,letters, meeting 
minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be retained b y the investigator according to 
ICH, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreeme nt, whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg,retirement, relocation), Shire should be prospectivel y notified.  The study  
records must be transferred to a designe e acceptable to Shire , such as another investigator, 
another institution, or to an independent third party  arranged by  Shire . Investigator records must 
be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study  or for longer 
if req uired b y applicable local regulations.
The investigator must obtain Shire 's written permission before disposing of any  records, even if 
retention requirements have been met.

12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It isthe responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Co pies of IRB/IEC approvals should be 
forwarded to Shire .
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate ap parent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In that 
event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/ IEC and Shire in writing immediately  after the 
implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of th is Study
This study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the 
general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research 
Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), 
Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (I nternational Conference on Harmonization 1996), and 
the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 2008).
In addition, this study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International 
Conference on Harmonisation guideline on Good Clinical Practice, and applicable local 
regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names on 
any sponsor forms, reports, publications, or i n any other disclosures, except where required b y 
laws.
Subject names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be replaced by anumerical 
code consisting of a numbering s ystem provided by  Shire in order to de -identify  the trial subject .
In case of data transfer, Shire will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and protection of 
subject personal data.
The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements.
The informed consent document(s) used during the informed consent process must be reviewed 
by the sponsor, approved by  the IRB/IEC, and available for inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject, or his/her legal ly acceptable representative, 
is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of this study and possible risks associated with 
participation.  The investigator, or a person designated by  the investigator, will obtain written 
informed consent from each subject or the subject's legal ly acceptable representative before an y 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 106
PF-00547659/SHP647
A7281010 Protocol Am endment 5 14 Novem ber 2016
study -specific activity  is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's 
signed consent document .
12.4. Subject Recruitment
Advertisements approved by  ethics committees and investigator databases may  be used as 
recruitment procedures.  
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed ( ie,clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investi gator is aware of an y new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, Shire should be informed immediately .
In addition, the investigator will inform Shire immediatel y of an y urgent safety measures taken 
by the investigator to protect the study  subjects against any  immediate hazard, and of any serious 
breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of T rial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient subjects have been recruited and completed this study as stated in the 
regulatory  application ( ie,Clinical Study  Application (CTA)) and ethics applic ation in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) b y a 
Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion to 
this study in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all Participating Countrie s
End of Trial in all participating countries is defined as L ast Subject Last Visit .
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, change 
in opinion of the I RB/IEC, drug safet y problems, or at the discretion of Shire .  In addition, Shire
retains the right to discontinue development of PF-00547659 at an y time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, Shire will promptly  notify  the investigator.  
After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and the hos pital 
pharmacy  (if applicable) within 28days.  As directed by  Shire , all study  materials must be 
collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.
15.PUBLIC ATION OF STUDY RESUL TS
Publication of study  results is discussed in the Clinical Study  Agreement.

Stool frequency†:
0 = Normal no. of stools for this subject
1 = 1 to 2 stools more than normal
2 = 3 to 4 stools more than normal
3 = 5 or more stools more than normal
Subscore, 0 to 3
Rectal bleeding‡:
0 = No blood seen
1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time
2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time
3 = Blood alone passes
Subscore, 0 to 3
Findings on endoscopy:
0 = Normal or inactive disease
1 = Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability )
2 = Moderate disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability , erosions)
3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)
Subscore, 0 to 3
Physician’s global assessment §:
0 = Normal
1 = Mild disease
2 = Moderate disease
3 = Severe disease
Subsc ore, 0 to 3
*The Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.  Data are from 
Schroeder et al.
†Each subject serves as his or her own control to establish the degree of abnormality of the stool frequency.
‡The daily bleeding score represents the most severe bleeding of the day.
§The physician’s global assessment acknowledges the three other criteria, the subject’s daily recollection of 
abdominal discomfort and general sense of wellbeing, and other observations, such as physical findings and the 
subject’s performance status.

Appendix 4. Confrontational Visual Fields
To begi n the test, y ou will be asked to cover one ey e, fixing y our gaze on the examiner's ey es.  
The examiner will then conduct finger movements, bringing his or her hands into y our visual 
field from the sides.  Because your vision is divided into four quadrants in your brain, the 
examiner will hold up fingers in each quadrant.  You will say  how man y fingers you see without 
actuall y looking at them, thus testing your peripheral, or side, vision.

Appendix 6. 9-Hole Peg Test Administration
Pegboard is centered in front of subject with pegs placed in the container next to the board on the 
same side as t he hand being tested.  The dominant hand is tested first.  The following instructions 
are given to the subject as the examiner briefl y demonstrates the test:
“Pick up the pegs one at a time, using your dominant hand only, and put them into the holes in 
anyorder until all of the holes are filled.  Then remove pegs one at a time, and return them to the 
container.  Stabilize the board with your other hand.  This is a practice test.  See how fast you 
can put all the pegs in and take them out again.  Are you re ady? Go.”
After the subject completes the practice trial, the examiner say s, 
“This will be the actual test.  
The Instructions are the same.  Work as quickl y as you can.  Are you read y? Go!
[During the test] The examiner says, “ faster.”
The stopwatch is sta rted by  the examiner as soon as the subject touches the first peg, and is 
stopped when the last peg hits the container.  The container is next placed on the opposite side of 
the pegboard and the other hand is tested.
Other considerations:
1.It is acceptable to switch the position of the box to accommodate the patient.
2.Record time for each trial in total seconds.  There are two trials per hand.
3.Maximum time of 5 minutes (300 seconds) to complete one trial.
4.For subjects with upper extremity  tremors or truncal a taxias, stabilization of elbows on 
the table surface may  be used.
The Roly an 9-Hole Peg Test container cover (manufactured by  Smith and Nephew, Inc), can be 
used to store pegs during administration of the test; however, a towel, felt cloth or the Dy cem 
Matunder the container to keep dropped pegs from rolling away  on the floor may  be helpful.  
Please calculate the total score in seconds.  Test is administered using the dominant and 
nondominant hands.

Appendix 7.Symbol Digit Modality Test
Administering the Written Version of the SDMT
This version of the test may  be either group or individually  administered.  The test form is 
handed to the examinee(s) and the following instructions are read aloud b y the examiner 
(examiner reads onl y the boldface words):
Please look at these boxes at the top of the page.  You can see that each box in the upper 
row has a little mark in it.  Now lo ok at the boxes under the marks has a number.  Each of 
the marks in the top row is different, and under each mark in the bottom row is a different 
number.
Now look at the next line of boxes (examiner points to line of boxes) just under the top 
two rows.  N otice that the boxes on the top have marks, but the boxes underneath are 
empty .  You are to fill each empty  box with the number that should go there according to 
the way  they  are paired in the key  at the top of the page.  For example, if you look at the 
first mark, and then look up at the key , you will see that the number 1 goes in the first 
empty  box.  So write the number 1 in the first box.  Now, what number should y
ou put in 
the second box? (Number 5) That’s right.  So write the number 5 in the second bo x.  
What number goes in the third box? (Number 2) Two, right.  That is the idea.  You are to 
fill each of the empty  boxes with the numbers that should go in them according to the 
key.  Now for practice, fill in the rest of the boxes until y ou come to the double line.  
When y ou come to the double line, stop.
The examiner should check to see that each examinee understands the task.  Any  errors made in 
the first 10 practice responses should be immediately  pointed out by  the examiner and corrected 
by the examin ee.  If an examinee has not understood the nature of the task, the instructions are 
repeated with further examples until the nature of the test is clearl y understood.  The examiner 
then continues with the following instructions:
Now when I say  “Go!” write in the numbers just like y ou have been doing as fast as y ou 
can until I  say “Stop!”  When y ou come to the end of the first line, go quickly  to the next 
line without stoppi ng, and so on.  If you make a mistake, do not erase, just write the 
correct answer ov er your mistake.  I  repeat, DO NOT ERASE as y ou will waste time.  
Just write the correct answer over your mistake.  Do not skip any boxes and work as 
quickly  as you can.  Ready ? Go!
Exactly 90 seconds from starting , the examiner says:
Stop!

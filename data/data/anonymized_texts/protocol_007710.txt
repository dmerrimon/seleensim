Page 4 of 64https://irb.research.vcu.edu/irb/sd/Doc/0/8NPJRL2EO444D40941UUBAIJDD/fromString.htmlbut few clinical trials. Kravitz et al, investigated the efficacy of tooth movement with Invisalign. They evaluated themovements of each tooth individually and concluded that the mean accuracy of movement with Invisalign was 41%.The least accurate movement was extrusion at 29.6%. Krieger et al specifically evaluated anterior tooth position withInvisalign and investigated interarch parameters such as overjet, overbite, and midlines. They concluded that Invisalignsuccessfully corrected anterior crowding, including severe crowding via incisor proclination. Simon et al investigatedthe effect of attachments and found that premolar rotations were the least accurate movement at 40%.The 2009 Kravitz et al study reported that maxillary lateral incisors were the teeth that most commonly requiredextrusion. This was a particularly inaccurate movement with aligners due to the difficulty of the aligners grasping theteeth and pulling them vertically. Boyd described absolute extrusion as being particularly challenging and advocated forthe use of a mid-treatment correction such as elastics attached to a button bonded to the facial aspect, or combiningextrusion with more predictable movements like lingual constriction or retroclination. Orthodontists have reported 70%to 80% of their aligner patients needing some level of mid-treatment intervention or refinement series to accomplish thegoals of the treatment plan.Though more recent studies have reported improvements in the predictability of most aligner movements, themeasured outcomes still fall short of the anticipated changes. Because of the particular difficulties involved withcontrolling maxillary lateral incisor vertical positioning with aligners, there are many differing expert opinions on howlateral incisor extrusion should be accomplished. Glaser described in his �10 commandments of attachment design�,that 4 mm wide gingivally beveled attachments on the maxillary lateral incisors would aid in more accurate extrusivemovement. Gomez et al described the initial force systems generated by plastic aligners with and without attachments.They found that attachments created the force systems necessary to bodily tooth movement. Additionally, in a guesteditorial in The Angle Orthodontist in 2008, Brezniak claimed that attachments added retentiveness and that extrusionwas a difficult movement without attachments due to the clear aligners� tendency to concentrate force in the incisalportion of the teeth. No studies to date have specifically evaluated the challenging movement of maxillary lateralextrusion prospectively, comparing differences in attachment design and determining differences in their effectiveness.Clinicians can choose any attachment design whether it be the optimized attachments Invisalign provides, a horizontalattachment, or a beveled horizontal attachment, to name a few. A recent study found that orthodontists most frequentlychose optimized (17%), rectangular (12%), incisally beveled rectangular (11%) or gingivally beveled rectangularattachments (46%) over other options for enhancing extrusion and that these choices were significantly different fromthose of general dentists (50%, 22%, 11%, and 3%, respectively). It is up to the clinician, using their expertise, todetermine which attachment design best suits the goals of their treatment plan and there are no scientific data currentlyavailable. There are a limited number of prospective clinical studies in the literature on any aspects of orthodontictreatment using aligners. 2. * Describe the study hypothesis and/or research questions.  Use lay language whenever possible.Question: Which attachment design is most efficacious in extruding maxillary lateral incisor?Null Hypothesis: There will be no difference in the efficacy among the four most-commonly used attachment designs(optimized, horizontal, gingivally-beveled horizontal, and incisally-beveled horizontal extrusion attachments) inextrusion of maxillary lateral incisor.The goal of the study is to evaluate efficacy of different attachments and not their effectiveness on lateral incisorextrusion.3. * Describe the study's specific aims or goals.  Use lay language whenever possible.The aim of this prospective, randomized controlled trial is to determine which of the four different attachment designs(optimized, horizontal, gingivally-beveled or incisally-beveled) offers more predictable extrusion of maxillary lateralincisors in patients treated with clear aligners (Invisialgin, Align Technologies, Inc, USA). The secondary objective is toevaluate the accuracy of ClinCheck software in predicting the three-dimensional final position of the lateral incisorfollowing extrusion using the attachment designs tested. The purpose is to be able to provide clinically-relevantrecommendations for attachment planning for extrusion of maxillary lateral incisors during aligner treatment.4. * Describe the scientific benefit or importance of the knowledge to be gained:Maxillary lateral incisor extrusion is one of the least effective movements with clear aligners. Orthodontists and generaldentists using their expertise can design clear aligner attachments how they see fit for the particular tooth movementthey are trying to achieve. Currently there is no evidence in the literature that compares the efficacy of differentattachment designs for maxillary lateral extrusion. There is however, anecdotal evidence based on clinician experienceregarding which attachment is more efficacious different experts tout different designs. This study will serve as a guidefor clinicians to design the best attachment for the most effective and predictable extrusion of the maxillary lateralincisor. More predictable and effective lateral extrusion will limit the need for midcourse intervention for patients andthat will result in less appliances and treatment time.5. * Describe any potential for direct benefits to participants in this study:Although all attachments are known to be somewhat effective in lateral incisor extrusion, patients in one arm of thestudy may benefit more from the use of specific type of attachment that was randomly assigned to that group.6.

Whenthe sample size is 15, a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with a 0.05 significance level will have 80%power to detect a difference in means across the 4 groups of the repeated measures factor characterized by an effectsize of 0.199 (based on a Variance of means, V=?(�?-�)�/M, of 0.156, a standard deviation at each level of 1.25,and a between level correlation, ?, of 0.5). Increasing the sample size to 20 per group would have power to detect an effect size of 0.146 andvariance of means of 0.114. These estimates reflect small effect sizes 15 and therefore would beable to detect clinically meaningful differences in the extrusion of the 4 attachments.

Eligibility screening prior to consent and how those activities will be carried out (when applicable)See the help text for additional guidance.1. Patients in this study will be recruited from:a. Department of Orthodontics at Virginia Commonwealth University using axiUm, the electronic health recordb. Two private practice offices (Richmond and Chantilly) in Virginia. These practices own and manage their EHR whichwill be used to identify potential study participants. Both private practice orthodontists are rated as VIP Diamond plusproviders by Invisalign (meaning they are among the top providers of this treatment nationwide) and one of them isalso an adjunct faculty who supervises most of the aligner cases treated at VCU. 2. Since the potential participants are those who actively seek orthodontic treatment at any one of these threelocations, we would have the contact information and no additional recruitment methods would be used. 3. a. Routine clinical practice: All potential patients seeking orthodontic treatment will have an initial consultationappointment with the orthodontist. At this appointment, the orthodontist will have an opportunity to assess patientneeds/ expectations as well as conduct an examination to present viable treatment options to the patient. All patientswill also have their teeth and gums scanned by an intraoral scanner. This information is sent to Align Technologywhose proprietary software (ClinCheck) is used to design and engineer a sequential set of trays that wouldprogressively move teeth to their ideal positions in the mouth. ClinCheck software also provides the quantitativeestimate of the magnitude of tooth movement required (in tenths of mm) as well as its direction (in degrees). Together,this information is used to design the clear aligners. b. Study related screening: During this consultation appointment, the patients will be evaluated to see if they meet the stated exclusion criteria(missing teeth in maxillary arch; lateral incisors with pathology/ restorations, treatment plan include extractions,presence of anterior cross bite, need for maxillary lateral incisor extrusion) to screen out ineligible study participants. All patients who do not meet the exclusion criteria will be considered potential study participants and will be informed ofthe study and requested to participate and consent obtained. Their teeth and gums will be scanned as indicated underroutine clinical care and the final inclusion will be determined based on the report generated by ClinCheck (>0.3mmlateral incisor extrusion and <6mm crowding). The time gap between intraoral scanning and generation of ClinCheck isa few days and getting the consent for all non-excluded participants is proposed out of respect for patient/ doctor's timebecause it precludes a need for a separate appointment (just to get consent) and improves efficiency.It will be explained to the patient that they could be excluded from the study if analysis of ClinCheck software dataindicates their ineligibility (required lateral incisor exclusion <0.3mm and crowding >6mm). Such patients would beconsidered screening failures.5. * Does this study have a separate protocol document (i.e. a multisite or sponsor's protocol) that contains adetailed description of the study's methodology?  YesNo6. * Since a separate protocol document is not uploaded, describe the proposed research using languageunderstandable to those IRB committee members whose expertise is not scientific.

The biostatistician on the study team (Dr. Carrico) will generate random sequence in blocks of 4 using a computer. All study participants will be assigned a unique identifier (4 digit code) generated by the study team based on order ofenrollment and the type of attachment. The key that links code to the patient will be stored in the PI's office computerthat has restricted access (only to study personnel). The key will be destroyed when the study is completed. 2.

Kravitz and Gardner will have a meeting prior to start of the studyto calibrate on the screening criteria to determine eligibility as well as obtaining signatures and maintaining the consentdocuments. The team will also have a virtual meeting over zoom at least once a month to update on study progress. All members of the study team will inform Dr. Groody when a study participant is recruited to the study through asecure email. Dr. Groody will then communicate the randomly assigned attachment design to the treating orthodontistbased on the sequence generated by Dr. Carrico. The treating orthodontist will then put this information as an order toAlign Technology for the fabrication of the attachment trays and clear aligners. During the scheduled appointment for the delivery of aligners, the patients will be instructed on how to properly placeand remove aligners and their maintenance. Patients will be instructed to wear each aligner for a minimum of 22 hoursa day for 7 days. Participants will verbally confirm compliance at each appointment. At the end of a series of 20-25aligners, another intraoral scan will be taken and sent to Align Technologies to determine the final positions of theteeth. Comparison of initial and final positions (using Geomagic software) will be done to assess the efficacy ofdifferent types of attachments in lateral incisor extrusion. Once the teeth are in desired positions, the treating orthodontist will remove the attachment (<6 months). 3. Research related interventions include:a. random assignment of the specific type of attachment on lateral incisor; b. treating orthodontist placing the corresponding order in the prescription with Align Technology; c. delivery of attachments and aligners to the study participantsd. Superimposition of final and initial positions of lateral incisors: Two superimpositions will be completed. Thepretreatment model will be superimposed with the predicted final model to establish the predicted movement of themaxillary lateral incisors. The pretreatment model will be superimposed with the posttreatment model to establish theactual movement of the maxillary lateral incisor. The actual and predicted movement values will be calculated by theGeoMagic software. The amount of extrusion for the lateral incisors will be analyzed in increments of 0.1 mm.Sample size: 80 maxillary lateral incisors with at least 20 teeth per study group. Randomization will occur at the level ofindividual lateral incisor tooth. Study Duration: Patients will be evaluated only after the first series of aligners (20-25). Each set of aligners would beworn for a week and the study would span 20 - 25 weeks.7. * The IRB only reviews research activities, so indicate which of the study activities are:   - Being performed exclusively for research purposes (i.e. they would not otherwise be done apart from thisstudy) VERSUS.  - Alterations of routine activities/procedures (e.g. the study is altering the timing, frequency, method,location, amount, etc.) VERSUS.  - Being done for other purposes and whose data/results will be used secondarily in the study (e.g. standardmedical or psychological tests, routine education practices, quality improvement initiatives, etc.).Research related interventions include:a. random assignment of the specific type of attachment on lateral incisor; b. treating orthodontist placing the corresponding order in the prescription with Align Technology; c. delivery of attachments and aligners to the study participantsd. Superimposition of final and initial positions of lateral incisors: Two superimpositions will be completed. Thepretreatment model will be superimposed with the predicted final model to establish the predicted movement of themaxillary lateral incisors. The pretreatment model will be superimposed with the posttreatment model to establish theactual movement of the maxillary lateral incisor. The actual and predicted movement values will be calculated by theGeoMagic software. The amount of extrusion for the lateral incisors will be analyzed in increments of 0.1 mm.In clinical practice (as in this study) it is nearly always needed to take an intraoral scan at the end of the first set ofaligners. This is an optical scanning of the mouth and has no additional risks associated with it. In this study, the scanwill be used to assess the results of the randomized intervention. For practice purposes, it is used to constructretainers (if the treatment is done) or, more commonly, to construct an additional set of aligners to continue treatmentand improve the result for the patient.8. If applicable, describe alternatives (research or non-research) that are available to potential participants if theychoose not to participate in this study:They can choose to continue to receive the Invisalign care without being a part of the study. They will not berandomized and the treating orthodontist will choose the type of attachment based on clinical judgment andexperience.9.

The study is a 4-arm randomized trial. Subjects will be screened for eligibility based on inclusion/ exclusion criteria.Once informed consent is obtained, the participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four attachment designs.The biostatistician on the study team (Dr. Carrico) will generate random sequence using a computer. Therandomization will be in block of 4 and the list will be provided to the study team. All study participants will be assigned a unique identifier (4 digit code) generated by the study team based on order ofenrollment and whether they received horizontal, incisally bevelled, gingivally bevelled or optimized attachments. Thiskey that links code to the patient will be stored in the PI's office computer that has restricted access (only to studypersonnel). The key will be destroyed when the all participants complete their second scan (data collection iscomplete).

If no, explain why the recordings need to be maintained:There are no audio or video recordings in this research. The standard of care in orthodontics is to have patient images(full face, profile) as well as multiple intraoral images (teeth within jaws) before the start, during and at the end oftreatment.

This page creates a plan for whenand how information/specimens could be shared.Try to anticipate all reasonably foreseeable sharing so that the consent document can also reflect that information.However, it is acceptable to amend this page later and explain either how re-consent of previously and currentlyenrolled participants will occur or why re-consent should not be required.The IRB reviews this page against the consent document (if one exists) to demonstrate the ethical principle ofRespect for Persons by confirming that plans for sharing do not go against what participants would understandabout the use of their data/specimens.The IRB also ensures there are adequate protections for the privacy of participants and the confidentiality ofparticipants' data/specimens when data is shared with others. 1. * Is it likely investigators could discover information about child/elder abuse or neglect that would requiremandatory reporting by the investigators or staff?The Code of Virginia requires that most medical personnel and all employees of institutions of highereducation report suspected child/elder abuse or neglect.  YesNo2. * Will the sponsor or investigator obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study?Certificates of Confidentiality  (CoC) are issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the FDA and CDC toprotect identifiable research information from forced disclosure.

If Other is selected, explain:dental assistants who support the clinic operations6. * Describe the consent procedures used for this group. Include when, where, and how consent / assent will beobtained both initially and, if applicable, during ongoing participation in the study:Consent process will start when treating orthodontists/ residents deem the patient may be eligible based onestablished inclusion/ exclusion criteria. Any member of the study team will present the research study in detail in asemi private room in the treating orthodontic clinic to potential participants. If the patient agrees to participate in thestudy, the consent document document will be presented and their signature obtained. If the participant is not an adult,the conversation will include the parent/ legal guardian and their signatures obtained. Children assent will be obtainedwhen appropriate7. * Describe the process for minimizing any potential perception of undue influence to participate when there isa pre-existing relationship between the participant and the researcher (e.g. treatment provider/patient;instructor/student; supervisor/employee, etc.):All potential participants wilfully seek orthodontic care at any of the three study locations. These subjects choose tobecome patients after the initial consultation appointment. There is no pre-existing relationships between the treatingresident / orthodontist and the potential patient. In this sense, study participants are no different from any other patient. In any case, the study team will make it clear to the potential participant that the participation is completely voluntaryand non-participation will not affect the intended treatment in any way.8. * How much time will participants be given to make a decision:They would be given 2 weeks to make a decision.9. If applicable, describe the procedures for consenting children upon entering adulthood or participants whoare no longer decisionally impaired:This is a short term study that will last a maximum of 6 months. In the unlikely situation that the participant entersadulthood at any stage of the study (while actively on the first series of aligners or during data analysis), we willreconsent him/her using the adult consent document. Even though the study itself lasts only 6 months, the comprehensive orthodontic treatment would take much longer(12-18 months). In a vast majority of cases, incisor correction is done at the start and we expect all data analysis to becompleted within a few months after the second scan. There are 2 possibilities when the issue of reconsenting arise:a. If the participants turns 18 while they are still on aligner therapy (irrespective of whether they are on initial series orbeyond): In these cases, the study team will have an opportunity to see the participant in person for routine follow-upand will re-consent in personb. In the rare instance where the patients are off aligner therapy when data analysis is still in progress, the study teamwill reach out to the participant over phone and will seek reconsenting. We have checked the box for waiver ofdocumentation of reconsent.

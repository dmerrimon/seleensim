2. What are the research questions or hypotheses  to be studied?   
The purpose  of this research  study  is to evaluate  the feasibility  of a full-scale  efficacy  
randomized  control  trial (RCT)  of SUMMIT,  a multi -component  web program  designed  to enable  
Veterans  to safely  taper  opioids.  
 
The study  will examine  the feasibility  of using  the SUMMIT  app in conjunction  with a 
motivational  interviewing  session  in opioid  tapering,  compared  to only using  an already  
established  mobile  application  (Manage  My Pain).  
 
We hypothesize  that the proposed  feasibility  trial will support  a future  definitive  large -scale  trial.   
 
3. Describe the relevance to Veterans of studying the above questions or hypotheses  and 
the importance of the knowledge this project is likely to generate : 
Veterans  have  approximately  double the rate of opioid  overdose  compared  with non Veterans.  
(3) Along  with the myriad  potential  adverse  events  (AEs)  associated  with long-term opioid  
therapy  (LTOT),  mounting  evidence  suggests  it has modest  or absent  benefit.  The first 
pragmatic  long-term randomized  control  trial (RCT)  comparing  an opioid -intensive  to an opioid  
avoidant  chronic  pain management  strategy  found  no improvement  in chronic  pain outcomes  in

Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  Veterans  and double  the side effects  at 12 months.  Guidelines  recommend  tapering  LTOT  when  
harm  outweighs  benefit;  observational  data suggest  improved  quality  of life among  persons  who 
successfully  taper.   
 
While  guidelines  recommending  against  LTOT  initiation  should  help prevent  future  harms,  
hundreds  of thousands  of Veterans  currently  on LTOT  are left vulnerable  as there  are 
insufficient  resources  to help them  taper  and/or  ultimately  discontinue  LTOT.  To afford  a safe,  
veteran -centered  tapering  strategy  to those  currently  prescribed  LTOT,  programs  must  be 
developed  to extend  the reach  of face-to-face encounters  with health  professionals.  Thus,  we 
are developing  SUMMIT  as an ancillary  intervention  to support,  reinforce,  and complement  
provider -initiated  opioid  tapering  initiatives  across  the VHA.

HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  SECTION 4:  POTENTIAL RISK /BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
1. Indicate the potential risk level of the project:  (Minimal Risk is defined as “the  probability  and 
magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves 
than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or 
psychological examinations or tests.”)  
              Minimal            Greater than Minimal  
NOTE:  The IRB will make the final risk level determination . 
 
2. What are the potential risks or harms for participants in this project ?   
     (List in bullet or number format)  
• Psychological:  The Veteran  subjects  may risk distress  from considering  opioid  tapering.  The 
study  team  will attempt  to mitigate  this risk through  clear  explanation  of the study  goals  and 
risks prior to subject  participation.  
• Social:  There  may be some stress  regarding  potential  loss of confidentiality  on the part of 
subjects  that are part of the motivational  interviewing,  which  the study  team  will attempt  to 
mitigate.  
• Confidentiality  and Privacy:  There  is some  risk of confidentiality.  Efforts  by the study  team  will 
be made  to minimize  this risk by following  protocols  that will keep  all research  documentation  
secured.   
NOTE :  Risks or harms can be physical, psychological, financial, social, or legal. They may involve 
breaches of confidentiality and privacy.  Do not include the risks of usual care unless usual  care 
is part of the research interventions being performed . 
 
3. What a re the anticipated benefits, if any, to participants or to society from this project?  
(List in bullet or number format)  
• Participants  may need  less opioid  medication  to manage  pain 
• Participants  may experience  improvement  in overall  functiniong.  
• Veterans  may also not directly  derive  any benefit  from participating  in this research  
project.  However,  if this approach  is effective,  it could  have  tremendous  benefits  for 
society  if adopted  on a wide scale  to help individuals  effectively  taper  their opioid  
dosage.  
 
4. Briefly describe the procedures for the orderly withdrawal or termination  of subjects  if this 
study  involve s any medical therapy.  N/A

anticipatory  guidance  on when  to seek  medical  attention.  In addition,  participants  will be 
asked  to report  to the study  team  any events  they feel resulted  from participatio n in the 
study.  They  can either  present  in person  or call on the study  team.  Study  staff will 
contact  the participant  to collect  any information  on the issue  and then the PI will review  
and determine  whether  it is okay  to proceed,  further  investigation  is needed,  or the 
participant  should  stop the study.  The PI will review  all report  of adverse  events  within  
24 hours  of their occurrence  and on a monthly  basis  determine  if a change  in protocol  is 
indicated  due to the occurrence  of adverse  events.    
        
8. If the PI is not a clinician, is there an appropriately credentialed and privileged clinician          
who has been designated as a member of the study team to make required decisions to   
help protect the health of the subject, review data on adverse events , and report new          
findings?       Yes      No      N/A  
 
9. How will you manage information from participating sites that might be relevant to 
participant  protection  and d escribe how that information will be  conveyed  to the  IRB  (i.e., 
reports of problems, inte rim results)?    
       Participating  site (VACHS,  West  Haven  campus)  will not be involved  in the collection  of data.  
Any problems  at VACHS  such  as theft,  loss and unauthorized  access  of records,  or evidence  of 
harm  will be reported  immediately  to the PO, ISO, and IRB. Data  will be shared  with the West  
Haven  via through  shared  folder  on the CHERP  server .

1. Objectives(s):  The purpose  of this study  is to evaluate  the feasibility  of a full-scale  efficacy  
randomized  control  trial (RCT ) of SUMMIT  (), a multi -component  web program  designed  to enable  
Veterans  to safely  taper  opioids .  
 
2. Research Design:  The study  design  is a 9-month,  randomized,  two-arm, parallel,  open -label  
feasibility  trial. Eligible  participants  will be randomized  to a brief single  Motivational  Interview  (MI) 
session  and SUMMIT  versus  a pain monitoring  app, Manage  My Pain App. All participants  will be 
provided  a referral  to speak  with a clinical  pharmacy  specialist  about  their medications  and options  
for tapering.  Feasibility  and outcomes  planned  for a full-scale  RCT will be collected  at one-, three -, 
six-, and nine-months  post-interven tion. Opioid  dose  and AEs will be collected  biweekly.  Given  the 
urgency  to develop  effective  programs  to support  tapering  efforts,  an interim  analyses  will be 
conducted  at three  months  to evaluate  trends  in the recruitment  rate, use of SUMMIT , and opioid  
dose reduction.  If positive,  results  of these  analyses  will expedite  the onset  of the planned  full-scale  
RCT.    
 
3. Methodology:  This study  will target  Veterans  on long-term opioid  treatment  (LTOT)  who will be 
identified  using  data available  in the VA National  Corporate  Data  Warehouse  (CDW)  and a focused  
electronic  medical  record  (EMR)  for Veterans  who remain  potentially  eligible.  Inclusion  criteria  for 
Veterans  will be primary  care patients  who are dispensed  ≥84 consecutive  days  of a stable  dose  of 
opioids  (reflecting  three  consecutive  28-day prescriptions)  or on buprenorphine  through  primary  care 
and who report  stable  levels  of pain intensity  over the past month.  Exclusion  criteria  will be Veterans  
on liquid  methadone,  have  hearing  or visual  impairments  (not corrected  with hearing  aids or glasses),  
psychiatric  conditions,  cognitive  impairments,  or participating  in a concurrent  pain or opioid -related  
research  study.  Up to 64 patients  will be recruited  to participate  in Phase  2. The study  visit with the 
participants  will be conducted  in a private  area within  the clinical  care setting  or in a research  
designated  room  at the CMCVAMC.  After completing  informed  consent,  participants  will be trained  
how to electronically  complete  baseline  assessments  on their preferred  device  (i.e., tablet,  smart  
phone,  laptop).  Afterwards,  the patients  will be randomly  assigned  to the intervention  or contro l 
group. All participants  will be provided  a referral  to speak  with a clinical  pharmacy  specialist  about  
their medications  and options  for tapering.  The intervention  arm will participate  in a MI session  lasting  
between  30 and 60 minutes,  which  will be audio  recorded,  and use SUMMIT . The participant  will be 
registered  into the VA HealtheDialog  text messaging  system  to allow  for surveys  and the SUMMIT  
web application  to be sent via text messages . The control  arm will not participate  in a MI session  and 
will use the Manag e My Pain app, which  only includes  a pain monitoring  function.  Opioid  dose  and 
AEs will be collected  biweekly . Assessments  will be completed  electronically  at one, three,  six, and 
nine months  post-randomization.  A detailed  report  will be prepared  of these  findings. The team  from 
the West  Haven  VA will be involved  only in the data analysis  of of the study  data.

1. Introduction  
1.1. Provide scientific background and rationale for study.   
Marked  increases  in opioid  prescribing  in the last 25 years  have  led to serious  patient  safety  
issues  and modest  or no benefit.  Opioid  prescribing  quadrupled  from 1990 -2015.  Meanwhile,  
rates  of serious  harms,  some  that typically  occur  acutely  and some  related to cumulative  long-
term exposure,  have  increased.(1)  the most  catastrophic  harm  – overdose  – has increased  5-fold 
since  1995  and is now the number  one cause  of accidental  death  in the u.s. by a large  margin.(2)  
veterans  have  approximately  double  the rate of opioid  overdose  compared  with non-veterans.(3)  
along  with the myriad  potential  adverse  events  (aes)  associated  with long-term opioid  therapy  
(LTOT ), mounting  evidence  suggests  it has modest  or absent  benefit.  A cochrane  meta -analysis  
of randomized  and non-randomized  studies  lasting  six months  or longer  in nearly  5000  
participants  found  only a small  or modest  benefit  among  study  completers  (representing  ~30%  of 
participants).(4)  the first pragmatic,  long-term randomized  controlled  trial (rct) comparing  an 
opioid -intensive  to an opioid  avoidant  chronic  pain management  strategy  found  no improvement  
in chronic  pain outcomes  in veterans  and double  the side effects  at 12 months.(5)  moreover,  
survey -based  studies  of veterans  describe  high levels  of ambivalenc e about  LTOT  with fears  
about  becoming  dependent  and complaints  about  waning  benefit  and feeling  “drugged.”(6)   
 
Guidelines  recommend  tapering  LTOT  when  harm  outweighs  benefit;  observational  data suggest  
improved  quality  of life (qol) among  persons  who successfully  taper.  In view of the evidence  for 
harm  and limited  benefit  of LTOT , both the centers  for disease  control  and prevention  and va/dod  
recently  released  guidelines  for LTOT  that stood  out as marked  departures  from previous  
guidelines  in that they both recommended  avoiding  initiation  of LTOT .(7, 8) regarding  persons  
currently  on LTOT , both strongly  recommended  tapering  or discontinuing  opioids  when  harm  
outweighs  benefit.  Concurrently,  the strongest  evidence  to date demonstrate  no added  benefit  of 
LTOT in veterans  with chronic  pain(5)  and observational  studies  demonstrate  that patients  who 
successfully  taper  experience  improved  qol and stable  or even  improved  pain.(9 -12) taking  all 
these  factors  together,  we assert  that it is patient -centered  and evide nce-based  to inform  all 
patients  on LTOT  about  the known  harms  and typically  absent  benefit  of this therapy  and to offer 
all patients  on LTOT  the opportunity  to engage  in a structured  supportive  tapering  program.   
 
Despite  the widespread  calls for de-imple menting  LTOT , patient -centered  methods  of tapering  or 
discontinuing  opioid  therapy  are still needed.  A recent  systematic  review  found  62 studies  of 
opioid  tapering  but only nine rcts.(13)  benefits  in pain severity,  function  and qol following  opioid  
reducti on or discontinuation  were  achieved;  however,  few of these  interventions  were  conducted  
in primary  care settings  and all were  of very low quality  evidence.  One subsequent  rct of a 
physician  assistant -led opioid  tapering  program  compared  to usual  care among  persons  willing  to 
taper  found  that the intervention  group  improved  significantly  more  than the usual  care group  in 
self-reported  pain interference,  pain self-efficacy,  and prescription  opioid  problems  at 22 
weeks.(14)  yet, there  was no difference  in the decrease  in mean  opioid  dose  across  groups.  In an 
evaluation  of an organizational  level implementation  intervention  to improve  pain care quality  over 
four years,  the proportion  of primary  care patients  on LTOT  did not change,  despite  improvement  
in several  other  metrics  of pain care quality.(15)           
 
1.2. Include summary of gaps in current knowledge, relevant data, and how the study will 
add to existing knowledge .   
1. Indirect  data support  the potential  effectiveness  of a patient -centered  opioid  tapering  
intervention.  Qualitative  and quality  improvement  data show  that patients  are willing  to 
consider  tapering  if support  is present.  In our queri -funded  qualitative  study  of barriers  and 
facilitators  to reductions  in high-dose  opioid  therapy  (as well as uptake  of non-pharmacologic  
treatment),  patients  expressed  frustration  about  perceived  inadequate  communication  
regarding  the rationale  for pain treatment  plans;  lack of their own and provider  knowledge  
about  tapering;  and care fragmentation.(16)  other  va-based  work  revealed  that patients  view 
CMCVAMC IRB Form 101         Page 23 of 40 
Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  the possibility  of worsened  pain and the system  abandoning  them  as major  barriers  to 
initiating  tapers.(17)  they felt that having  acce ss to tailored  information  and timely  follow  up on 
treatment  plans  were  important  facilitators.  Providers  reported  struggling  to enhance  patients’  
motivation  to engage  with tapers  and being  daunted  by the close  and frequent  follow -up that 
changes  in pain treatment  would  entail.  They  discussed  the availability  of technology -
enhanced,  collaborative  care approaches  as strong  facilitators.   
 
2. An effective  web-based  program  could  be useful  in variably  resourced  settings.  In a needs  
assessment  conducted  for this study,  primary  care providers  (pcps)  and veterans  noted  that 
the main  barrier  to opioid  tapering  was the lack of resources  available  to veterans  between  
outpatient  visits.  The goal of this proposal  is to address  this gap by developing  SUMMIT, an 
interactive,  theory -informed,  multi -component  mobile  website  program  to enable  veterans  to 
safely  taper  opioids.  To expedite  implementation,  as advised  by the office  of connected  care,  
we propose  to develop  SUMMIT  as a web-based  program  that can be access ed with 
anonymized  login  credentials,  does  not store  personal  health  or identifying  information,  and 
does  not interact  with the va health  record  (akin  to va ptsd coach).  SUMMIT , if shown  to be 
effective,  would  be useful  in augmenting  the effort  of well-resourced  facilities  that can afford  
dedicated  provider  time to tapering.  But in the more  common  scenario  in which  clinicians  
have  little time to devote  to tapering,  SUMMIT  could  be used  as an enhancement  to usual  
care,  modeled  after a landmark  study  by tanne nbaum  et al.(18)  in this study,  older  patients  on 
long-term benzodiazepine  treatment  were  mailed  a detailed  8-page  pamphlet  that included  
safety -related  reasons  they should  taper  benzodiazepines  and instructions  on tapering.  At six 
months,  27% of the intervention  group  had discontinued  benzodiazepines  compared  with 5% 
of the control  group.  While  this study  demonstrates  that people  can taper  medications  with 
relatively  minimal  support,  based  on our qualitative  results(16)  and our experience  caring  for 
vetera ns on LTOT , we believe  that additional  motivation  and support  will be required  to be 
successful.   
 
3. Intervention  mapping  (im) is a rigorous  method  of developing  a multicomponent  behavior  
intervention.  Expert  consensus  recommends  stepwise  development  of an intervention  
following  a structured  framework.(19)  the widely -studied  and applied  im approach  will serve  
as the framework  for developing  SUMMIT .(20) im was created  to help health  promoters  
develop  the optimal  intervention,  based  on planning,  research,  and theory,  by creating  a 
vocabulary  for intervention  planning,  procedures  for planning  activities,  and technical  
assistance  with identifying  theory -based  determinants  and methods  for change.  Im also 
provides  a taxonomy  of behavior  change  techniques  (bcts)  for use in supporting  intervention  
content.  In healthcare,  im has been  successfully  applied  to a wide range  of different  
behaviors  and populations.(21)  particularly  relevant  to developing  ehealth  interventions,  im 
lends  itself to a user-centered  design,  which  is essential  to maximize  acceptability,  use, and 
adherence.  We will use im to guide  this proposal  in two broad  areas:  (1) the identification  of 
behavioral  and environmental  determinants  related  to opioid  tapering,  and (2) the selection  of 
the most  appropri ate theoretical  methods  and practical  applications  to address  the identified  
determinants.   
 
4. Web-based  applications  are effective.  Web-based  programs,  requiring  no, or SUMMIT ed 
(synchronous  or asynchronous)  person -to-person  contact,  can be effective  in changing  
behaviors  as well as in treating  chronic  conditions.  A recent  review  found  that web-based  
interventions  decreased  illicit substance  use after treatment  [hedges’  g (95%  ci) = 0.31 (0.23  - 
0.39)]  and after six to 12 months  of follow -up [hedges’  g (95%  ci) = 0.22 (0.07  - 0.37)].(22)  a 
review  of computerized  interventions  for depression  and anxiety  (common  co-morbid  
conditions  in veterans  with chronic  pain)  commissioned  by the va’s evidence -based  synthesis  
program  reported  large  post treatment  effects  for patients  diagnosed  with generalized  anxiety  
(standardized  mean  difference  (smd)  = 0.94)  and major  depression  (smd  = 0.82)  and 
moderate  treatment  effects  for those  with depressive  symptoms  without  a confirmed  
CMCVAMC IRB Form 101         Page 24 of 40 
Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  diagnosis  of major  depression  (smd  = 0.40).(23)  of particular  relevance  to this proposal,  
several  systematic  reviews  have  confirmed  that web-based  programs  are an effective  adjunct  
to help patients  manage  chronic  pain.(24 -27) the most  recent  review  found  effect  sizes  
(hedges'  g) of -0.39 for pain interference,  -0.33 for pain intensity,  and -0.49 for 
catastrophizing.(28)   
 
5. Studies  have  found  that multicomponent  interventions  are more  effective  than single  
component  interventions.(29,  30) testing  a multicomponent  intervention  “as a package”(31)  
will enabl e us to test the strongest  possible  program;  however,  this approach  makes  it difficult  
to understand  the mechanism  of action  underlying  any observed  changes  and does  not 
provide  a clear  understanding  of whether  inclusion  of all components  is required  to achieve  
the same  benefit.  To mitigate  this limitation,  we will follow  best practices  to enable  future  
“deconstruction”  of SUMMIT  by: specifying  the theoretical  rationale  for each  bct; enumerating  
the specific  theoretical  constructs  associated  with each  bct; classifying  each  bct according  to 
the im taxonomy;  measuring  actual  use of each  component;  supplementing  quantitative  
measures  with qualitative  data to improve  measures  of actual  use; and examining  whether  
the amount  of use of specific  SUMMIT  components  is associated  with change  in specified  
theoretical  constructs,  and whether  the latter  mediate  the relationship  between  treatment  
assignment  and clinical  outcome  measures  (see d.14.b  and d.17.a).(31 -36) 
 
6. Incorporating  the right design  features  is important  to maximize  retention.  Though  there  are 
several  important  advantages  to web-based  health  interventions,  including  their ability  to 
dramatically  increase  access,  offer a menu  of options  that can be selected  according  to each  
individual  veteran’s  preferences,  and tailor  information  based  on individual  user’s  needs  
and/or  performance,  attrition  is a well-documented  and prevalent  downside.(37)  several  
strategies  have  been  shown  to decrease  attrition.  These  include:  choosing  bcts based  on 
relevant  theoretical  cons tructs,(38)  tailoring  information,(39)  provision  of feedback,  social  
networking  and support,(40,  41) and use of “nudges”  or persuasive  techniques.(42)  in a 
recent  detailed  review  of adherence  to web-based  interventions,  “dialogue  support”  was 
found  to be the principle  persuasion  technique  influencing  adherence.(43)  in this context,  
dialogue  support  includes  offering  praise,  rewarding  targeted  behaviors,  use of system  
reminders  or prompts,  providing  suggestions  to help reach  target  behaviors,  inclusion  of 
content  that reminds  patients  of themselves,(39)  using  an attractive  design,  and ensuring  that 
the system  acts in a social  manner  (for example  as a coach  or instructor).(43)  feedback  is an 
effective  component  of dialogue  support  and can be successfully  delivered using  automated  
systems.   
 
7. Motivating  veterans  to taper  LTOT  will be challenging.  We acknowledge  that motivating  
veterans  on LTOT  to taper  will be difficult  as many  may be strongly  biased  to remain  with the 
status  quo. We will address  this bias by including  motivational  interviewing  (mi) as part of the 
intervention.  Mi is a patient -centered  approach  that explores  and develops  patients’  
motivation  and commitment  to change  within  a collaborative,  highly  empathic  patient -provider  
relationship.  Characteris tically,  providers  blend  a combination  of fundamental  patient -
centered  counseling  skills  (e.g.,  reflective  listening)  with advanced  strategic  methods  to elicit 
patient  statements  that favor  change,  called  “change  talk.”  Trained  counselors  help the 
patient  develop  and appreciate  discrepancies  between  important  life goals  and current  
behavior;  thus,  the motivation,  while  facilitated  by the counselor,  comes  from the patient.  Mi 
has been  demonstrated  to significantly  increase  patients’  intrinsic  motivation  for change  and 
to increase  self-efficacy  for making  behavioral  changes  across  multiple  conditions.(44 -49) in 
this study,  dr. Edmond  (co-i) will conduct  a single  mi session  with participants  randomized  to 
the intervention  arm. The use of single  session  mi is supported  by several  studies.(50 -53)  
 
8. Innovation:  how our vision  for SUMMIT  differs  from currently  available  pain apps.  Robust  pain 
self-management  skills  are critical  to enable  patients  with chronic  pain to optimize  qol. In view 
CMCVAMC IRB Form 101         Page 25 of 40 
Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  of this need,  numerous  web- and smartphone -based  applications  (apps)  have  been  
developed  to increase  competence  and confidence  is using  these  skills.(54,  55) while  we 
recognize  the value  of these  interventions,  they are not designed  to impact  LTOT  and 
therefore  are unlikely  to addre ss the specific  needs  of veterans  interested  in tapering.  Indeed,  
our qualitative  work  and preparatory  interviews  with patient -partners  have  emphasized  the 
need  to tailor  the messaging  and content  of self-management  strategies  to issues  relevant  to 
LTOT . Based  on the tannenbaum  study  cited  above,(18)  we infer that to impact  behavior  
change  with respect  to opioid  use, addressing  the issue  directly,  clearly  and transparently,  as 
we propose  to do in SUMMIT , will afford  the highest  likelihood  of observing  LTOT  reductions.  
Thus,  SUMMIT  will differ  from available  apps  in that 1) it will include  approaches  directly  
aimed  at encouraging  and supporting  tapering,  and 2) all self-management  strategies  
included  in the prototype  will be tailored  to the specific  needs  of those  on LTOT . Phase  1 of 
the SUMMIT  trial focus ed on development  of the application;  Phase  2 is focus ed on feasibility  
testing.   
 
9. Significance:  while  guidelines  recommending  against  LTOT  initiation  should  help prevent  
future  harms,  hundreds  of thousands  of veterans  currently  on LTOT  are left vulnerable  as 
there  are insufficient  resources  to help them  taper  and/or  ultimately  discontinue  LTOT . To 
afford  a safe,  veteran -centered  tapering  strategy  to those  currently  prescribed  LTOT , 
programs  must  be developed  to extend  the reach  of face-to-face encounters  with health  
professionals.  Pcps,  responsible  for most  of LTOT  prescribing  in VHA, are already  
overextended  and spending  additional  time recommending  and overseeing  opioid  tapers  may 
be untenable.  Thus,  we are developing  SUMMIT  as an ancillary  intervention  to support,  
reinforce,  and complement  provider -initiated  opioid  tapering  initiatives  across  the vha. To 
ensure  rigor and successful  future  implementation,  we will: 1) develop  an evidence -based  
program  with features  proven  to maximize  engagement  and retention;  2) ensure  that the 
program  includes  mechanisms  to address  the diverse  obstacles  veterans  report  when  
consider  opioid  tapering  (e.g.,  fear of pain flares  and abandonment  by the system);  3) employ  
a user-centered  design  process  with meaningful  input  from veterans  and pcps  throughout  the 
development  and testing  phases;  and 4) adhere  to recently  published  guidelines  for mobile  
health  intervent ions.(56)  in addition,  to ensure  that SUMMIT  is veteran -centered,  veterans  
have  played  and will continue  to play key roles  in its development,  testing,  and execution .

4. Study Procedures  
4.1. Study Design  
4.1.1.  Describe experimental design of the study.  Include sequential and/or parallel 
phases of the study, including durations, and explain which interventions are 
standard of care.   
The study  design  is a 9-month,  randomized,  2-arm, parallel,  open -label  feasibil ity 
trial. Eligible  participants  will be randomized  to a brief single  Motivational  
Interviewing  (MI) session  and SUMMIT  versus  a pain monitoring  app. All 
participants  will also be provided  a referral  to speak  with a clinical  pharmacy  
specialist  about  their medications  and options  for tapering. Feasibility  and outcomes  
planned  for a full-scale  RCT will be collected  at one-, three -, six-, and nine-months  
post-randomization.  Opioid  dose  and adverse  events  (AEs)  will be collected  bi-
weekly . We will send  the link to the questionnaire  to the participant  if they have  
given  permission  to contact  via email,  otherwise  we will send  them  the link via text, 
or read it aloud  to them.  Given  the urgency  to develop  effective  programs  to 
support  tapering  efforts,  we will perfo rm interim  analyses  at three  months.  If 
positive,  results  of these  analyses  would  expedite  onset  of the planned  full-scale  
RCT.  
 
Eligible  patients  on long term opioid  treatment  (LTOT)  or on buprenorphine  will be 
identified  through  VA Corporate  Data  Warehou se (CDW).  Receipt  of opioid  
medication  will be defined  as any dispense  of a VA formulary  category  CN101  
drug.  Veterans  having  liquid  methadone  dispensed  in the previous  six months  will 
be excluded.  Because  all methadone  for the treatment  of OUD  is dispense d at 
federally  licensed  opioid  treatment  programs,  we will cross  check  all methadone  
dispenses  with stop code  523, the code  used  exclusively  in those  programs.  For 
Veterans  who remain  eligible,  a focused  electronic  medical  record  (EMR)  review  
will be condu cted to determine  whether  the Veteran  is currently  receiving  liquid  
methadone  or participating  in a concurrent  pain or opioid -related  research  study,  
and to check  for evidence  of hearing  or visual  impairments  (not corrected  with 
hearing  aids or glasses),  cognitive  impairment  or psychiatric  condition.  A list of 
eligible  Veterans  will be compiled  into an Excel  file and saved  on the secured  
CHERP  server.  This list of potential  subjects  will NOT  be printed  out.

Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  The study  team  will reach  out via email  to the primary  care providers  of Veterans  
who remain  eligible  after the above  screening,  to ensure  the provider  agrees  with 
approaching  the Veteran  for possible  enrollment.  
 
Approved  Veterans   will then be mailed  a letter  informing  them  of the purpose  of 
the study.  The letter  will notify  potential  participants  that they will be telephoned  by 
the project  coordinator  and will offer them  the opportunity  to refuse  this contact  by 
calling  an answering  machine  and leaving  a message.  The project  coordinator  will 
telephone  all patients  who do not “opt out.” If someone  other  than the participant  
answers  the telephone,  no personal  health  information  (PHI)  will be shared  with the 
person  who answers.  Five attempts  will made  be to make  contact  with the potential  
participants.  Veterans  may also be informed  of the opportunity  to participate  in the 
study  by their primary  care provider  and be provided  with a study  letter.  The study  
team  will contact  the Veteran  within  a week  of provision  of study  letter.  Participants  
will be assured  that their participation  is voluntary  and that they can opt out from 
participating.  During  the telephone  call, the remaining  eligibility  criteria  will be 
verified.   
 
Up to 64 patients  will be recruited  to participate  in this research  study.  Due to 
COVID19,  participants  will undergo  the informed  consent  process  over the 
telephone , and provide  oral consent .  
 
All participants  will be offered  a referral  to a clinical  pharmacy  specialist  in the pain 
clinic  to discuss  options  for medication  management  and opioid  tapering.  As part of 
the informed  consent,  patients  will be reassured  that the tapering  steps  will be 
conducted  by their own pain care provider  or with the assistance  of the clinical  
pharmacy  specialist.. After  obtaining  consent,  participants  will be trained  on how to 
complete  baseline  and outcome  measures  on their preferred  device.  Surveys  will 
be sent to the participant  via email  through  RedCap . As an alternative,  we 
will register  participants  into the VA HealtheDialog  text messages  system  in 
order  to receive  surveys  and access  the SUMMIT  web application  via link.  
Baseline  measures  will be completed  during  this visit, prior to randomization,  to 
ensure  that participants  are comfortable  completing  surveys  electronically.  
 
Participants  will be randomly  assigned  to the intervention  or control  group  in a 1:1 
ratio in eight  blocks  of eight  using  the Research  Electronic  Data  Capture  (REDCap)  
Randomization  Module.   
 
Randomization  groups : 
Experimental  Intervention:  Participants  randomized  to the experimental  intervention  
will participate  in a Motivational  Interviewing  (MI) session  lasting  between  30 and 
60 minutes  with a study  coordinator . All MI sessions  will be audiotaped  using  a VA-
approved  digital  recorder  and transcribed  verbatim.  Participants  will subsequently  
be shown  how to access  SUMMIT  through  a web link via a set of unique  
anonymized  login  credent ials and to navigate  the components  of SUMMIT  on one 
or more  devices,  depending  on their preference.  They  will then be trained  on how 
to complete  the outcome  surveys on RedCap,  which  will be sent via email  .  
 
The SUMMIT  application  includes  multiple  modules  for participants  to learn  about  
opioid  tapering  as well as other  ways  to manage  their pain.  As part of the 
application,  participants  will also have  the option  to connect  with a peer support  
specialist  at the VA who has previous  experience  with chronic  pain and opioid  
tapering.

Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  Control  Intervention:  Participants  randomized  to the control  intervention  will use an 
eHealth  comparator:  Manage  My Pain(iPhone,  Android).  This app includes  a pain 
monitoring  function ing only,  and thus will only minimally  overlap,  if at all, with 
SUMMIT ’s components.  Control  participants  will not participate  in a MI session.  
Participants  will download  the app and be shown  how to use the Manage  My Pain 
app and trained  how to complete  the outcome  surveys   
 
In order to help participants set up their mobile applications, the study coordinator 
will set up a video appointment through the VA’s virtual care manager (VCM) and 
using the VA video connect (VVC) software. The appointment is coordina ted using 
the participants email address, and through the video appointment  the coordinator 
will help the participant set up their device.    
    
4.1.2.  Include a description of how anticipated risk will be minimized and include an 
analysis of risk vs. potential benefit.  
Veterans  with anxiety  or concerns  will be referred  to their primary  care physician.  
Each  Veteran  will be assigned  an ID number  that is not related  to any PHI. The key 
containing  the link between  the study  ID number  and participant  will be maintained  
on the CMCVAMC’s  secure  server  
(\\vhaphifpccherp.v04.med.va.gov \shares2 \Chhabra_Manik)  on a separate  folder  
from the collected  data.  Only Dr. Manik  Chhabra  (PI) and study  staff will have  
access  to this key. 
 
Neither  the SUMMIT  app nor the Mana ge My Pain app will be collecting  any 
personal  health  information.  The SUMMIT  app will collect  aggregated  data on 
usage  of features  of the app. The Manage  My Pain app once  downloaded  requires  
the user to complete  an end user agreement  that specificies  how any collected  
data will be used  and shared.   The app does  aggregate  non-personal  information  
from all users,  including  pain records,  age, geographic  location,  and gender,  which  
is stripped  of personal  information.  There  is an option  to sign up for an onlin e 
account  through  the Manage  My Pain app, which  would  collect  additional  
information,  however  study  participants  will be advised  not to do so. 
 
4.1.3.  Provide description of the study population (delineate all categories of 
subjects – patients, providers, family members, employees, etc.). Include 
anticipated enrollment numbers . 
This projects  involves  the recruitment  of 64 Veterans.  Patient  recruitment  at the 
CMCVAMC  will target  male  and female  patients  enrolled  in long term opioid  
treatment  (LTOT).  
 
4.1.4.  As applicable, provide information on any added protections for vulnerable 
populations.  
N/A 
 
4.1.5.  If applicable include information on data and specimen banking.

64 subjects  
 
5.2. Describe when, where, how and by whom potential subjects will be identified and 
recruited.  
Eligible  Veterans  will be identified  through  data-base  review  of eligibility . The study  team  will 
reach  out to the Veteran’s  provider  to ensure  they agree  with recruitment,  and then the 
CMCVAMC IRB Form 101         Page 29 of 40 
Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  Veteran  willbe mailed  a recruitment  letter  with study  information  and an invitation  to 
participate.  The letter  will also notify  potential  participants  that they will be telephoned  by the 
project  coordinator  and will offer them  the opportunity  to refuse  this contact  by calling  an 
answering  machine  and leaving  a message.  The project  coordinator  will telephone  all 
patients  who do not “opt out”. Five attempts  will be made  by telephone.  During  screening  
phone  call, inclusion/exclusion  criteria  will be confirmed.  Study  visits will be scheduled  same  
day as clinical  appointments  when  possible.  
 
5.3. Describe materials that will be used to recruit subjects, e.g., advertisements.  
Include materials as an appendix or separate attachment  
A recruitment  letter  will be used,  as noted  above  in 5.2. 
 
5.4. Describe any payments to subjects, including the amount, timing (at the end of the 
study or pro -rated for partial study participation), method (e.g., cash, check, gift 
card), and whether subjects will experience a delay in receiving the payme nt. 
Participants  will be compensated  $50 for the baseline  questionnaire,  $5 per biweekly  
survey  (up to 18 times  over 9 months)  and $25 per quarterly  survey  (up to 4 times  over 9 
months).  Participants  can be compensated  up to $2400 total incentive.  Patients  will be 
paid via vouch er or check  from the VA. 
 
6. Informed Consent Procedures  
6.1. Indicate if informed consent will be obtained and/or if you are requesting a waiver of 
informed consent or waiver of documentation of informed consent.  If the research 
involves multiple phases, specify for which phases of the research the waiver(s) is 
being requested and/or the informed consent will be sought.  
Informed  consent  will be obtained . We will be obtaining  an oral informed  consent  in part 
due to limitations  as a result  of COVID19 . This is due to risks of obtaining  in person  
consent  for both patients  and study  staff. The patient  will be contacted  via telephone  or VA 
Video  Connect  for the consent  process,  and the informed  consent  form will be read aloud  
to the participant  to ensure  full understanding  of the purpose  of the study,  study  
procedures,  as well as the risks and benefits  of participating.  Once  the study  coordinator  
confirms  through  questioning  that the participant  fully understands  all aspects,oral  consent  
will be documented.  A copy  will be mailed  to the patient  and be placed  in the patient’s  
chart .  
 
6.2. Describe who will be obtaining informed consent, if applicable, and any 
circumstances that may need to be addressed (e.g. subjects with impaired decision 
makin g ability and the use of a legally authorized representative, etc.)  
Study  staff,  such  as the PI or the project  coordinator  will obtain  informed  consent.  
 
6.3. If applicable, indicate how local site study personnel will be trained regarding 
human subjects ' protections requirements and how to obtain and document 
informed consent.  
All study  staff will be trained/overseen  by PI. All study  staff will have  completed  relevant  
training  regarding  human  subjects  protection  and how to obtain  informed  consent . All 
personnel  are required  to have  CITI (Good  Clinical  Practices  and Ethical  Principles),  VA 
Privacy  and Information  Security  Awareness  and Rules  of Behavior,  and Privacy  and 
HIPAA  Trainings.  In addition,  all study  staff obtaining  informed  consent  will have taken  the 
VA Research  Compliance  Officer  training.   
 
7. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
7.1. Describe the criteria that determine who will be included in or excluded from the 
study.  
Inclusion  criteria  for Veterans  will be primary  care patients  who are dispensed  ≥84 
consecutive  days  of a stable  dose  of opioids  (reflecting  three  consecutive  28-day 
CMCVAMC IRB Form 101         Page 30 of 40 
Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  prescriptions)  through  primary  care and who report  stable  levels  of pain intensity  over the 
past month.  Patients  will also need  to have  a smartphone  with the ability  to download  a 
mobile  application.  
 
Exclusion  criteria  will be Veterans  on liquid  methadone  or buprenorphine  for opioid  use 
disorder  (OUD)  and those  who have  transitioned  to buprenorphine  (transdermal  or 
sublingual)  for chronic  pain,  have  hearing  or visual  impa irments  (not corrected  with hearing  
aids or glasses),  psychiatric  conditions,  cognitive  impairments,  or participating  in a 
concurrent  pain or opioid -related  research  study.  
 
8. Study Evaluations  
8.1. Describe all evaluations to be conducted (including screening; tests/questionnaires 
that will be administered; any procedures that subjects will be required to complete) 
and data collection methods.  Include materials as an appendix or separate 
attachment.  
The following  questionnaires  will be delivered  through REDCap  by the study  coordinator  at 
the outset  of the study,  and then every  6 weeks  over the course  of the study:  Baseline  
Assessment,  Daily  Opioid  Dose,  Prescribed  Opioids  Difficulties  Scale,  PHQ -8, GAD -7, 
Modified  Social  Support  Survey,  Change  Questio nnaire,  BIRS -24, PROMIS -29 Profile  
v2.0,  and WHO  5-Item Well Being  Scale . Participants  will complete  the surveys  with the 
study  coordinator,  who will enter  the responses  intoRED Cap. 
 
9. Data Analysis  
9.1. Provide sample size determination and analysis (include ant icipated rate of screen 
failures, study discontinuations, lost to follow -up etc.).  
The calculated  number  of participants  to be enrolled  in this feasibility  study  was based  on 
the approach  outlined  by Cocks  and Torgerson  (85), which  recommends  using  a 1-sided  
confidence  interval  (CI) to determine  whether  it is worthwhile  proceeding  with a full-scale  
trial. If the proportion  of participants  achieving  the primary  outcome  is 20% or lower  in the 
control  group  (14), the sample  size required  to detect  a difference  of 15% in the main  trial 
(assuming  80% power,  alpha  = 0.05,  two-sided  test) is 276. (14, 85) A pilot sample  size of 
48 would  produce  a one-sided  90% CI that would  exclude  finding  a 15% difference  in the 
larger  fully-powered  trial. To account  for the reasonably  high drop-out rate, we will inflate  
the sample  size by 25%.  Thus,  we will randomize  64 participants.  
 
9.2. Describe how, where and by whom the data will be analyzed.  
Quantitative  statistics  will be performed  by SAS,  version  9.4. and will be performed  by Dr. 
Manik  Chhabra  (PI) and Dr. William  Becker  (co-I). As we are proposing  a feasibil ity trial, 
most  of the analyses  are descriptive.  We will use descriptive  characteristics  to describe  the 
study  population,  all feasibility  outcomes,  and the distribution  of the primary  and secondary  
outcomes  planned  for the full-scale  trial. We will ascert ain the distributional  characteristics,  
response  rates  as well as the percent  of the missing  data for all baseline  and follow -up 
measures  at each  time point. Although  not powered  to detect  significant  between -group,  
we will compare  differences  in the prima ry and secondary  outcomes  to examine  
preliminary  trends  that may inform  the design  of the full-scale  trial. We will use regression  
analyses  to examine  the association  between  group  assignment  and the primary  and 
secondary  outcomes.  Group  assignment  and time will be modeled  as fixed  factors  and 
participants  as random  factors.  Separate  models  will be conducted  for each  outcome.  We 
will perform  an interim  analysis  at three  months  to evaluate  trends  in the recruitment  rate, 
use of SUMMIT , and opioid  dose  reduct ion. These  results  may support  earlier  initiation  of 
the planned  full-scale  RCT.  Exploratory  mediation  analyses  will be used  to examine  the 
processes  underlying  change.  We will use the product  of coefficients  method  to determine  
whether  1) “dose”  (amount  of use with specific  SUMMIT  components)  and 2) change  in 
specified  theoretical  constructs  mediate  the relationship  between  treatment  assignment  
CMCVAMC IRB Form 101         Page 31 of 40 
Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  and clinical  outcome  measures.  (86) We will also examine  the effect  of compliance  on 
change  in theoretical  constr ucts and the primary  and secondary  outcome  measures  using  
a Complier  Average  Causal  Effect  analysis.  (87) To examine  heterogeneity,  exploratory  
moderating  analyses  will be performed  by including  an interaction  term (moderator  X 
intervention  status)  in a multiple linear  regression  model.  We will construct  separate  
models  for the following  five possible  moderators:  age, baseline  opioid  dose,  duration  of 
LTOT,  prevalent  comorbid  mental  illness,  and baseline  intrinsic  motivation.  Although  we 
will not be suffici ently  powered  to perform  definitive  mediation  or moderating  analyses,  the 
data generated  from this feasibility  study  will determine  which  measures  to include  in the 
full-scale  trial. 
 
10. Withdrawal of Subjects  
10.1.  Describe any anticipated circumstances under whic h subjects will be withdrawn 
from the research without their consent.  
Subjects  diagnosed  with opioid  use disorder  (OUD)  or substance  use disorder  (SUD)  
during  the study  will be withdrawn  and referred  for treatment.  The studyteam  will notify  
their PCP if this is the case.  Subjects  exhibiting  inappropriate  behavior  online  or with a 
peer specialist  may also be withdrawn.  
 
10.2.  Describe the consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research 
and the procedures for orderly termination of participation  by the subject (e.g., the 
subject contacting the investigator for an end -of-study visit).  
No consequences  for withdrawal.  Once  we are notified  of a participant’s  decision  to 
withdraw,  we can continue  to use information  about  them  that has been  collected  up to 
that point.  No information  will be collected  after a participant  formally  withdraws.  
11. Reporting  
11.1.  Include procedures for reporting unanticipated problems, serious adverse events, 
and protocol deviations.  
Protocol  deviations,  unanticipated/unexpected  problems  will be reported  to the IRB within  
5 business  days  of discovery.  We will use the CMCVAMC  serious -adverse  event  form for 
reporting  SAEs,  UADEs,  and any other  unanticipated/unexpected  problems.  We will also 
use the CMCVAMC  Protocol  Deviation  form for reporting  any protocol  deviations.  Any 
adverse  event  would  be reported  to the IRB at continuing  review.  Further,  if the patient  
develops  any concerns  with their medication  treatment  plans,  particularly  effect s related  to 
their opioid  tapers,  these  will be referred  to their PCP.  
 
12. Privacy and Confidentia lity 
12.1.  Describe whether the study will use or disclose subjects’ Protected Health 
Information (PHI).  
For Veterans,  we will need  to obtain  name,  date of birth,  complete  mailing  address,  race,  
gender,  and medical  history.  This information  will be used  only in our analysis  and to 
contact  the Veteran  (mailing  address);  no information  will be disclosed  to others  outside  
our study  team. The applications  being  used  by the study,  likewise,  will not use or disclose  
the participants  PHI. 
 
12.2.  Describe the steps that will be taken to secure the data (e.g., training, authorization 
of access, password protection, encryption, physical controls, Certificates of 
Confidentiality, and separation of identifiers and data)  
All study  personnel  will complete  the required  human  subjects,  HIPAA,  and information  
security  and privacy  trainings  at the VA. All paper/hard  copy  data,  which  includes  subject  
log, informed  consent  forms,  HIPAA  authorization  forms,  and surveys  will be maintained  in 
study  binders.  The study  binders  in CMCVAMC  will be kept in CHERP,  4100  Chester  Ave, 
Suite  202 in a locked  file cabinet.  Any electronic  data,  which  includes  the subject  log and 
the key linking participants  to their ID number  at CMCVAMC  will be kept on the secured  
CMCVAMC  server  vhaphicherpnas  (\\vhaphifpccherp.v04.  
CMCVAMC IRB Form 101         Page 32 of 40 
Philadelphia (642)   
HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  med.va.gov \shares2 \Chhabra_Manik).  The log and the key will be kept in separate  folders  
on the server  and will NOT  be printed  out. Study  personnel  with access  to study  data and 
who are no longer  involved  with the study  will have  access  revoked  and will be removed  
from the research  staff form.  
 
13. Communication Plan  for Multi -Site Studies or Studies being done at Non -CMCVAMC 
Locations

13.1.  Include plan for ensuring all required local site approvals are obtained and notifying 
the Director of any facility where the research in being conducted but the facili ty is 
not engaged.  
All current  documentation  of VA IRB approvals  will be stored  in the VA secure  server  
(\\vhaphifpccherp.v04.med.va.gov \shares2 \Chhabra_Manik)  and Dr. William  Becker  from 
the West  Haven  VA will upload  any local site approval  documents.  
 
13.2.  Include plan for keeping all engaged sites informed of changes to the protocol, 
informed consent, and HIPAA authorization . 
Monthly  team  meetings  will be held with the PI and study  staff to discuss  the study  
progress  (including  any changes  to the protocol,  informed  consent,  and HIPAA  
authorization).   
 
13.3.  Include plan for informing local sites of any Serious Adverse Events, Unantic ipated 
Problems, or interim results that may impact conduct of the study.  
Any SAEs,  Unanticipated  Problems  or interim  results  that may impact  conduct  of the study  
will be immediately  discussed  with the other  study  site (West  Haven  VA) and reported  to 
the CMCVAMC  IRB within  5 business  days  of discovery . We will use the CMCVAMC  
serious -adverse  event  form for reporting  SAEs,  UADEs,  and any other  
unanticipated/unexpected  problems.  We will also use the CMCVAMC  Protocol  Deviation  
form for reporting  any protocol  deviations.  Any adverse  event  would  be reported  to the IRB 
at continuing  review.  
 
13.4.  Include plan for ensuring the study is conducted according to the IRB -approved 
protocol.  
As mentioned  above  (13.2),  monthly  team  meetings  will be held with the PI and study  staff 
to discuss  the study  progress  which  help to ensure  the study  is being  conducted  according  
to the IRB-approved  protocol.  
 
13.5.  Include plan for notifying all local facility directors and LSIs when a multi -site study 
reaches the point that it no longer requir es engagement of the local facility (e.g., all 
subsequent follow -up of subjects will be performed by the PI from another facility).  
Once  the study  concludes  at the local facility  (Philadelphia)  – there  will not be any 
additional  follow -up of subjects  from another  facility  (West  Haven  facility).  Only data 
analysis  will be occurring  at the West  Haven  VA site after data collection  has been  
completed  at the Philadelphia  VA.

  The project involves  basic science research . Final data sets underlying publications resulting from 
such research will be shared as described in the space below.  [Describe mechanisms for sharing, 
e.g., upon request, through a databa nk or repository, via a website]  
The research involves 
human subjects . Data 
sets based on information 
obtained from human 
subjects will be shared as 
follows.  Check 
appropriate box.  
 
 
    Individually Identifiable Data  will be shared pursuant to valid HIPAA 
Authorization, Informed Consent, and an appropriate written agreement 
limiting use of the data to the conditions described in the authorization 
and consent.  
   A Limited Dataset (LDS) will be created and shared pursuant to a 
Data Use Agreement (DUA) that indicates adherence to any applicable 
Informed Consent provisions, appropriately limits use of the dataset 
and prohibits the recipient from ident ifying or re -identifying (or taking 
steps to identify or re -identify) any individual whose data are included in 
the dataset.  NOTE: An LDS does not necessarily imply de -identified 
data per HIPAA.  
   A De -identified, Anonymized Dataset  will be created and shared.  
NOTE: ORO recommends that such sharing take place under a written 
agreement that adheres to any applicable Informed Consent provisions 
and prohibits the recipient from identifying or re -identifying (or taking 
steps to identify or re -identify) any individual whose data are included in 
the dataset. However, it is permissible for final datasets in machine -
readable format to be submitted to a nd accessed from PubMed Central 
(and similar sites) provided that care is taken to ensure that the 
individuals cannot be re -identified using other publicly available 
information.  
It is likely  that requests for 
data from outside 
researchers (or other 
entities) may correspond 
to one or both  of the 
following special 
conditions:  
    Individually Identifiable Data , excluding Veterans’ names and 
38 USC §7332 -protected information, will be shared, pursuant to a 
written request and IRB approved waiver of HIPAA authorization, wi th 
the approval of the Under Secretary for Health,  in accordance with VHA 
Handbook 1605.1 §13.b(1)(b) or §13.b(1)(c) or superseding versions of 
that Handbook. Note: Subject to all other listed requirements, Veterans’ 
names may be shared with other Federal agencies (38 USC §5701), 
and with non -Federal investigators who provide the names and 
addresses of the individual subjects.  
   Individually Identifiable Data,  including 38 USC 7 332-protected 
information, will be shared, pursuant to the above requirements and a 
written assurance from the recipient that the information will be

HRPP Accepted:  08/21/2019  APPROVED BY CMCVAMC IRB ON 04/12/2022  Additional details on mechanisms for sharing final data sets as indicated in Section 4 above.  
 
Section 5 - Briefly summarize how, where, when, to whom, and the extent to which  data resulting 
from the research will be made available outside VA.  
Section 5 answer:   A limited de -identified dataset will be made available on our CMCVAMC research 
website that is publicly available.  
 
Section 6 - Describe how and where  data resulting from the research will be stored and maintained 
(e.g., data will be stored and maintained in a secure ORD data repository or resource;  data will be 
stored on VA servers behind the VA firewall and backed up to a hard drive maintained and se cured in 
the investigator’s lab; etc.).  
Section 6 answer:  The dataset will be housed on a server, administered by CHERP behind the VA 
firewall, access being granted only to those who apply directly to you, provide the necessary assurances 
that they will not re -identify the data, and submit to a clearance by the CMCVAMC Privacy Officer. The 
VA will not permit data to be stashed with NIH, not without a lot of data transfer approvals.  
 
Section 7 - Describe the mechanisms for ensuring the protection of  personal privacy, the 
confidentiality of individually identifiable information, and the security of proprietary data and 
information.  
Section 7 answer:  All data will be de -identified prior to being made available.  
 
Section 8  - Describe the scientific and/or public purposes  for making the data available (i.e., how will 
scientists and/or the public benefit from making the data available) and explain how the data available 
for sharing will permit validation of results  by the recipients (e.g., s ufficient data and descriptors will be 
made available to confirm conclusions in the publication, duplicate statistical analysis, perform additional 
analyses, etc.).  
Section 8  answer:  The scientific purpose of making this data available is to allow indepe ndent analysis 
of the data and to allow investigators to consider new analyses of the data that might further the study of 
opioid tapering among Veterans.  
 
Section 9  - Describe the mechanisms for ensuring the protection of  personal privacy, the 
confidentiality of individually identifiable information, and the security of proprietary data and 
information.  
 
Section 9 answer:  See above - All data will be de -identified prior to being made available.  
 
Section 10  - Describe the scientific and/or public purposes  for making the data available (i.e., how 
will scientists and/or the public benefit from making the data available) and explain how the data 
available for sharing will permit validation of results  by the recipi ents (e.g., sufficient data and 
descriptors will be made available to confirm conclusions in the publication, duplicate statistical analysis, 
perform additional analyses, etc.).  
Section 10 answer:  See above - The scientific purpose of making this data av ailable is to allow 
independent analysis of the data and to allow investigators to consider new analyses of the data that 
might further the study of opioid tapering among Veterans.  
 
Section 11  - As Principal Investigator  for the proposed research,  I attest  to the accuracy of the 
information provided above, and I understand that – 
• Final data sets must be maintained locally in accordance with VA Records Control Schedule 10 -1 
or until enterprise -level resources become availa ble for long -term storage and access (unless 
otherwise required or permitted by the relevant VHA Program Office)  
• Failure to implement this DMAP may result in restrictions to subsequent research activities

 3 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
Influenza virus infection represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, 
resulting in 9.2 -35.6 million illnesses, 140,000 -710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000- 56,000 deaths 
annually since 2010 (1). This results in life- years lost, quality of life reduced, and an economic and 
medical cost of between $71 billion and $167 billion per year. Along with the fact that influenza can 
trigger deadly pandemics such as the 1918 pandemic that resulted in the deaths of 50 million to 
100 million people (3 -5% of the global population), these data illustrate the high level of priority 
needed to curb the public health threat of influenza. Influenza continues to be a problem due to the 
problems with the current vaccine strategy. Now our vaccines incorporate on ly three or four of the 
large number of circulating strains, with no adjuvant except for the elderly, and provide only 10 -
60% protection from influenza infection ( 2). Annual modifications of the vaccine are required each 
year, based on predictions of the n ext season’s circulating strains. This strategy is often thwarted 
by the annual antigenic changes that occur in influenza virus composition. In addition to the issues 
with seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza typically starts with unpredicted strains, fo r which 
entirely new vaccines are required, significantly hindering our preparedness. These reasons and 
more highlight the necessity for a better understanding of the key components of an effective 
immune response and how this could lead to a universal vac cine.  In study, we will use twins to 
investigate the role of genetics in immune response to both inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV 4) and 
live attenuated inactivated vaccine ( LAIV4 ). 
 
3.1 Potential Risks and Benefits  
3.1.1 Potential Risks 
 
This protocol will immunize children and adult participant s with either IIV4 (intramuscular ) or 
LAIV4 ( intranasal) vaccines that are licensed and recommended for use in the age groups 
studied. The discomforts of this study are those of  receiving IM injection or intranasal  
application of the vaccine,  and blood drawn from an arm vein, and possible reactions to the 
vaccine. Drawing blood causes transient discomfort and may cause fainting. Infection at the 
site where blood will be drawn or where the vaccination  is given is extremely unlikely, but is 
a potential risk. Bruising at the site of blood drawing may occur, but can be prevented or lessened by applying pressure for several minutes immediately after the blood draw. Immediate allergic reactions to vaccine, including anaphylaxis, are in general extremely 
rare (appr oximately 1 person in 4,000,000), and might occur as a skin rash such as hives, 
difficulty breathing, fainting, drop in the blood pressure and death. Such reactions can 
usually be stopped by emergency medications administered by study personnel. Vaccine 
recipients may develop systemic reactions such as fever, headaches, body aches, and  
fatigue. These reactions are usually greatest within the first 24 to 72 hours after vaccination 
and last 1 to 2 days. Analgesics (e.g., aspirin or Tylenol
â) and rest will generally relieve or 
moderate these symptoms. Other hypersensitivity reactions, including Arthus  reactions 
resulting in large local swelling reactions, are also possible. Although Guillain -Barré 
syndrome may have been associated with the 1976 -77 inactivated swine influenza vaccine 
and TIV vaccines used in early 1990's, subsequent inactivated vaccines have not been 
associated with an increased risk of this condition. LAIV4  has the potential for transmission 
of influenza to close contacts with severely weakened immune systems (requiring care in a protected environment, such as a bone marrow transplant u nit).  It is not known whether

 LAIV4 ( FluMist Quadrivalent ) is excreted in human milk. Because some viruses are 
excreted in human milk,  lactating wom en will not be eligible for this study . 
 
3.1.2 Known Potential Benefits  
 
Participant s given the seasonal influenza vaccine  are likely to experience decreased 
frequency and severity of subsequent influenza infection. The beneficial role of influenza 
vaccination has been recognized increasingly over the past several years as more 
information has become available about the high r ate of morbidity and mortality from this 
respiratory pathogen.

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a  phase IV  study of 40 healthy 2-20 year old volunteers  (all members of twin sets) who are 
given licensed  seasonal  influenza vaccine . Following confirmation of written informed consent (and 
assent , if applicable) , baseline blood samples will be drawn from all study participants prior to 
immunization. The volunteers will be enrolled in to one of  2 groups (randomized by twin pair) : 
 
Group A:  Up to 10 healthy MZ and 10 healthy DZ twin volunteers, 2 -20 year  old, will be given 
seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) . Each volunteer  will complete a total of 3 
visits:  Day 0 (pre-immunization),  and Day 7  +/- 1  and Day 28 +/-  7 (post -immunization ). All visits  
will consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring for adverse events (SAEs)  and 
adverse events (AEs) . 
 
Group B:  Up to 10 healthy MZ and 10 healthy DZ twin volunteers, 2 -20 year  old, will be given 
quadrivalent live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). Each volunteer  will complete a total of 3 
visits:  Day 0 (pre -immunization), and Day 7 +/- 1 and Day 28 +/- 7 (post -immunization) . All visits 
will consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring for serious adverse events (SAEs)  
and adverse events (AEs).

5.5 Dosage, Preparation and Administration of Study 
Intervention/Investigational Product  
 For children between 2 -3 years, IIV4 vaccine will be administered as a 0. 25 mL dose, with a 
sterile, disposable syringe and needle by IM injection into the vastus lateralis muscle 
depending on the development of the deltoid. For participants 3 years or older,  IIV4 vaccine 
will be administered as a 0.5 mL dose, with a sterile, disposable syringe and needle by IM injection into the deltoid muscle. The participant /guardian  will choose whether the injection 
will be administered into the right or left deltoid.  
 LAIV4  vaccine dosage is 0.2  mL Vaccine will be administered as an intranasal spray. Each 
sprayer contains a single dose of FluMist ® Quadrivalent ; approximately one -half of the 
contents should be administered into each nostril. 0.1 mL (i.e., half of the dose from a 
single FluMist sprayer) is administered into each nostril while the recipient is in an upright 
position. Insert the tip of the sprayer just inside the nose and rapidly depress the plunger 
until the dose- divider clip stops the plunger. The dose divider clip is removed from the 
sprayer to administer the second half of the dose (0.1 mL) into the other nostril.

Participants will be administered the seasonal IIV4 vaccine  in the left or right deltoid muscle 
using antiseptic technique  or into the vastus lateralis  (right or left) for participants younger 
than 3 or for those with limited deltoid muscle development . Participants under the age of 3 
years will receive 0.25 mL and all other participants will receive the 0.5 mL dose . 
 
LAIV4 vaccine dosage is 0.2 mL Vaccine will be administered as an intranasal spray. Each 
sprayer contains a single dose of FluMist ® Quadrivalent; approximately one -half of the 
contents should be administered into each nostril. 0.1 mL (i.e., half of the dose from a 
single FluMist sprayer) is administered into each nostril while the recipient is in an upright 
position. Insert the tip of  the sprayer just inside the nose and rapidly depress the plunger 
until the dose- divider clip stops the plunger. The dose divider clip is removed from the 
sprayer to administer the second half of the dose (0.1 mL) into the other nostril.  
Volunteers will be observed in clinic for 15 minutes  after vaccination to monitor for any 
immediate serious reactions.

 7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Definitions of AEs, Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse 
Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintend ed 
sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs may also include pre -or 
post-treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol specified proced ures, lack of 
efficacy, overdose, drug abuse/misuse reports, or occupational exposure. Preexisting 
events that increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of 
participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs. An AE doe s not include the 
following:  
 
• Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, and 
transfusion. The condition that led to the procedure may be an adverse event and must be 
reported   
• Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before 
the Screening Visit that do not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospitalization for elective surgery, social and/or convenience admissions)  
• Overdose without clinical sequelae  
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not 
an AE. It is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented as medical history.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that results in the following:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it we re more severe.)  
• In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• A medically important event or reaction; such events may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes constituting SAEs. Medica l and 
scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is reportable 
under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; bloo d dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; and development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal 
product will be considered a medically important event and be subject to expedited 
reporting requirements.

18 
 Clinical laboratory abnormalities and other abnormal assessments without clinical 
significance are not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities that 
require medical or surgical intervention or lead to study drug discontinuation must be 
recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. In addition, laboratory or other 
abnormal assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, x -rays, vital signs) that are associated with 
signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definit ion of an 
AE or SAE as described above. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record 
the syndrome or diagnosis (e.g., anemia), not the laboratory result (i.e., decreased 
hemoglobin).  
7.2 Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event  
 
The Protocol Director is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity, and for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information and assessments.  
 
The Protocol Director is responsible for assessing the relationship to study drug treatment 
using clinical judgment and the following considerations:  
 
• No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (e.g., pre -existing 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).  
 
• Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational medicinal product.  
 
Ineffective treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of adverse 
event reporting. The relationship to study procedures (e.g., invasive procedures such as 
venipuncture or biopsy) should be assessed using the following considerati ons:  
 
• No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study procedure.  
 
• Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol procedures (e.g., 
venipuncture).  
 
The severity grading of AEs will be assessed as Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 using the Common 
Terminology for Adverse Effects, Version 5.0, November 27, 2017, located at 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quic
k_Reference_8.5x11.pdf  and Grade 2 or higher AEs recorded. 
 
For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis 
of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in 
agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality.

19 
 7.3 Instructions for Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events 
 
SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur after the participant first consents to 
participate in the study (i.e., signing the informed consent) and throughout the duration of 
the study, including the protocol -required post treatment follow -up period, must be reported 
on the CRF. This also includes any SAEs resulting from protocol -associated procedures 
performed from screening onwards. All AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur 
from initiation of study drug until 4 weeks after last administration of study drug must be 
reported on the CRF. Any SAEs and deaths that occur after the Post -Treatment follow -up 
visit OR within 30 days of the last dose of study drug (whichever is longer), regardless of 
causality, should also be reported. All AEs should be followed up until resolution or until the 
adverse event is stable, if possible. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the 30 -day period.  
 
7.4 Reporting Procedures 
 
7.4.1 Regulatory Reporting for Studies Not Conducted Under an IND  
 
For those events meeting the previously described definition of Serious Adverse Events, 
the completion of an SAE report form is required. For SAEs related to vaccine, a VAERS 
form will be filled out and submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Syst em 
(VAERS) per federal regulations. The VAERS form will simultaneously be sent to the sponsor.  SAEs and events that meet the Prompt Reporting guidelines (events meeting the 
criteria for Unanticipated Problems) will also be reported to the Stanford IRB as required.  
Unexpected deaths or life -threatening experiences related to the research will be reported 
to the sponsor and to the IRB within 5 working days from when the investigator learns of event.  SAEs not related to vaccine will be reported to the IRB o n an annual basis.  
 
7.5 Safety Oversight  
 
The Clinical Core Principal Investigator will oversee compliance with the protocol, the 
participant’s safety and any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants and will 
report these events as described above.  Unanticipated problems and serious  adverse 
events will be reported to the Stanford IRB as required.

 8 CRITERIA FOR STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
8.1 Criteria for Permanent Study Discontinuation 
 
• Requirement for prohibited concomitant medications (such as immunosuppressant 
medication)  
• Clinical reasons such that continued participation in the study may be detrimental to the 
participant’s health as judged by the Protocol Director  
• Failure by the participant without reasonable cause to attend study visits  
• Request by the participant to withdraw.  
• Request of the primary care provider if s/he thinks the study is no longer in the best 
interest of the participant. 
• Participant judged by the investigator to be at significant risk of failing to comply with the 
provisions of the protocol as to cause harm to self or seriously interfere with the validity 
of the study results.  
• Participant died.   
• At the discretion of the IRB or Study Investigators.

 13 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
The investigator is responsible to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported. All source documents and data collection forms should be 
completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. B lack or dark 
blue ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copies. When making changes or 
corrections, the original entry will be crossed out with a single line, and initialed and dated 
to indicate the change. DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE, OR USE CORRECT ION FLUID 
OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL.  
 Data entered into the data entry system that is derived from source documents or data 
collection forms should be consistent with the source documents and data collection forms 
or the discrepancies should be explained.  
 
13.1 Data Management Responsibilities  
 
All source documents will be reviewed by the clinical team and data entry staff, who will ensure that they are accurate and complete. Serious adverse events will be assessed for 
causality, and reviewed by the site PI or designee.  
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision 
of the site PI. During the study, the investigator must maintain complete and accurate 
documentation for the study.  
 
The PI (or designee) will be responsible for data management, quality review, analysis, and 
reporting of the study data.  
 
13.2 Data Capture Methods  
 
Clinical data (including SAEs) will be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11 -compliant data entry 
system. The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplet e, or inaccurate. 
Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents or data collection forms.  
 
13.3 Types of Data  
 
Data for this study will include clinical, safety and outcome measures.  
 
13.4 Timing/Reports 
  
Data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis according to the site Quality Management Plan.  
Data analysis will begin once all clinical data have been collected and verified for accuracy. 
Preliminary analyses of outcome measures will begin as soon as laborato ry data are 
available. Participants will receive a unique study ID at enrollment.  All data for study 
analysis will be coded by study ID number and will be password -protected.  Coded 
protected health information will be provided only as needed for data ana lysis of study 
outcome measures.  Personal identifierswill be removed for publications.

Research Protections in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the sponsor, 
or Stanford University Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research and 
any other unit of Stanford University as necessary. 
 
13.5 Study Records Retention  
 
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study, including CRFs, source documents, data collection forms, consent forms, and medication inventory records, must 
be retained by the investigator for at least 3 years and in accordance with Stanfo rd 
University and Stanford IRB requirements and until the sponsor authorizes transfer or 
destruction of study records.   
 
13.6 Protocol Deviations  
 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol or Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP).  The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the 
investigator, or the study site staff.  As a result of deviations, corrective a ctions are to be 
developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
 It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations. All deviations from the Protocol will be addressed in a study subject data 
collection form. Protocol deviations will be sent to the local IRB/IEC per their guidelines.  
The site PI/study staff is responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements.

 14 PUBLICATION POLICY  
 
Following completion of the study, the investigator may publish the results of this research 
in a scientific journal. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) 
member journals have adopted a trials -registration policy as a condition for publication. This 
policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as 
ClinicalTrials.gov , which is sponsored by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Other 
biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. Any clinical trial starting 
enrollment after 27SEP2007 must be registered either on or before the onset of participant 
enrollment.  
 
The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human 
subjects to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship 
between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Studies designed for o ther purposes, 
such as to study pharmacokinetics or major toxicity ( e.g., Phase 1 trials), would be exempt 
from this policy.

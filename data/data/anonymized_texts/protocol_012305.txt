The purpose of this amendment is to allow the collection of progression biopsies from 
subjects who are withdrawn from the LCCC 1128 study for a variety of reasons 
including, but not limited to, a lack of tolerability, need  to receive other therapy or 
completio n of 3- years o f study treatment without progression. The subset of the 
aforementioned subjects who are later re-challenged with dab rafenib and trametinib  
combination therapy and then progress while on this treatment, may be biopsied at the time of their clinical or radiological progression. These subjects are required to consent to this biopsy collection  prior to being placed back on the LCCC 1128 clinical trial. 
Previously in protocol amendment #3, subjects who were withdrawn from study treatment due to an  inability to tolerate the combination regimen, but who continued on 
BRAF inhibitor targeted therapy, were able to be consented, at the time of progression from single agent therapy, to undergo the a progression biopsy. As the protocol’s objectives focus on combination therapy, the protocol is also currently being amended to remove this scenario. No subjects were biopsied who progressed solely on single agent therapy  and thus this amendment will not affect previously collected data. 
 The following modifications were made to this protocol for amendment #5:  
Editorial, Administrative Changes: 
• Minor spelling grammar and formatting changes throughout the protocol 
• Removal of Co-Investigators from the Face Page of the protocol 
• Addition of the IND # to the Face Page of the Protocol  
• IRB Reporting Requirements were updated in accordance with the UNC IRB 
SOPs  (Section 7.3.3) 
• FDA Expedited Reporting language was updated to better capture FDA guidance provided in 21CFR312.32 (IND Safety Reporting) (Section 7.3.3) 
• Required documentation (Section 9.2) was updated to include financial disclosures 
• Single Patient/Subject Exceptions (Section 9.5.2) was updated in accordance with Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Single Subject Exceptions Policy.  
 
Scientific Changes:  
• Updated the study synopsis, study schema, biopsy section, Time and Events Table 
and correlative study procedures  to indicate that former LCCC 1128 subjects who

 progress on standard of care dabrafenib/trametinib off study are eligible for a progression biopsy (Section 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 6.1 and 6.7) 
• The biopsy, duration of follow-up, Time and Events Table and follow-up assessments sections of the protocol were updated to indicate that subjects wo are placed back on study for the purposes of a progression biopsy will remain on study for safety monitoring, in relation to the biopsy procedure, for 30 days. Subjects who have an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) related to the study procedure at 30 days will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by the investigator (Section 4.2 , 4.7, 6.1 and 6.5).  
• The assessment of primary endpoint and efficacy section  (Section 6.9) was 
updated to clarify that analysis of progression biopsies from subjects placed back on stud y after progressing on standard of care dabrafenib/trametinib will be 
included in the analysis of the primary and correl ative secondary objectives . 
• The section on sample size and data analysis plans was updated to clarify that tumor samples from patients w ho progress on study and those who are removed 
from study and later progress on the combination treatment will be analyzed as one data set (Section 8.1).    
Eligibility Criteria:  
• Addition of inclusion criteria for off-study subjects who may be consented to come back on study for the purposes of a progression biopsy when they progress on standard of care dabrafenib and trametinib treatment (Section 3.3).  
o Subjects must have currently progressed while receiving trametinb and dabrafenib combination therapy. 
o Subjects must be willing to undergo a research biopsy 
o Subjects must have a tumor amenable to research biopsy 
o Subjects must provide informed consent 
o Subject must have been previously enrolled on the LCCC 1128 protocol.

The following modifications were made to this protocol for amendment #4: 
 1) This amendment adds a requirement for annual ophthalmic exams while on treatment (see section 6.3.4 and time and events table) 
2) Clarification of the duration follow-up period (see section 4.7 and 6.6). Regardless, of the reason that a patient comes off treatment, dermatologic exams will continue every 
3 months for the first 6 months following discontinuation from dabrafenib, and may be done by a physician local to the patient . Only after these dermatologic exams are 
complete is the patient considered off follow-up, even if they do not require survival follow-up for this entire 6 month period. 
3) This protocol amendment also clarifies that whether or not a subject enrolls in LCCC 1108, they will be asked to provide a single blood sample (approximately 8 mL) for research purposes. This blood sample may be collected at any point in the study, including during follow-up. 
4) Section 7.3.3 has been updated with the new language in regards to Novartis reporting re quirements. 
5) Robert G. Dixon, MD, Hyeon Yu, MD, and Kathleen Gordon, MD have been added as co -investigators to the protocol title page  
6) A line to provide the version of the protocol was added to the protocol signature page 
 
In addition, t he summary of changes for amendment #3 states that the sponsor changed 
from GSK to Novartis.  Novartis is the funding source for this study and not the sponsor.  No changes were made in protocol amendment #4 based on this clarification.

The following modifications were made to  this protocol for amendment #3: 
Eligibility criteria were modified to refine the definition of hypertension in exclusion 
criterion  3.2.6   
1) At progression biopsy wording was changed to allow for attainment of biopsies in subjects withdrawn from study treatment due to lack of tolerability of the combination regimen and continued on BRAF inhibitor targeted therapy.   These 
subjects should be re-consented so that progression biopsy can be obtained at the time of relapse on BRAF inhibitor targeted therapy (i.e., dabrafenib  or vemurafenib). 
(Sections 4.2 and 6.7 and footnote #11 to Time and Events Table in section 6.1) 
2) The frequency of tumor assessment scans was reduced to every 12 weeks for subjects 
responding to combination therapy after cycle 9 
      AND  
 The frequency of tumor assessment scans was reduced to every 6 months for subjects 
responding to combination therapy for > 2 years (Section 6.3.2 and footnote b added to Time and Events Table in Section 6.1) 
3) The frequency of ophthalmic exams was reduced a nd are now only required at 
Screening and as clinically -indicated due to the presence of ocular symptoms (Section 
6.3.2 and Time and Events Table in Section 6.1) 
4) Sponsor changed from GlaxoSmithKline to Novartis 
5) Blood Sample :  
 For those patients who do not co -enroll into LCCC1108, we will ask for a blood sample 
(~8mLs) to ensure sufficient germline DNA in the event tissue samples are insufficient or 
request blood samples collected under LCCC9001 with IRB # 90-0573. This change is 
reflected in section 1.6, section 6.1 footnote #13, and 6.7 
6) In anticipation of the pending switch from investigative product to commercial supply by the 
sponsor the following language was added: Trametinib/Dabrafenib commercially available 
product with auxiliary labeling will be provided by Novartis.  The study drug should be 
administered and stored as per the instructions specified on the label (refer to the label, the PI 
or the IB for more detailed information). In addition, MSDS will now be available upon 
request from Novartis and not GSK (See sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.2.1, and 5.2.2 
7) Sponsor SAE reporting requirements for GSK were deleted and replaced with SAE reporting requir ements for Novartis in section 7.3.3.

Minor editorial changes made throughout; changed biostatistician to Joseph Ibrahim, PhD; 
Requirement of tissue collection taking place at UNC have been removed as no other sites are 
involved in this study (sections 1.1, 1.7)   
Safety and Efficacy  
The 2 medications in the study were FDA approved in combination as of January 2014, and new 
Investigator Brochures were issued for dabrafenib, trametinib, and the combination.  Based on 
these documents (including the updated pack age inserts), additional information on safety and 
efficacy on the combination has been incorporated into the protocol.  These changes are reflected 
in sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 5.1 and 5.2.  Common AEs using combination therapy are listed in 
section 5.2.9. Section 1.7 was updated to include recent data indicating a possible survival benefit 
if patients are continued on BRAF inhibition post disease progression. 
 
Eligibility  
• Clarified that patients with elevated bilirubin due to Gilbert’s disease will not be excluded 
(section 3.1.6) 
• Clarified exclusion criteria 3.2.6 to  “Patients with history of hypertension should have 
hypertension adequately controlled (BP < 140/90) with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy 
or diet prior to study entry” 
• Changed central serous retinopathy to new name: retinal pigment epithelial detachment 
(RPED) (section 3.2.13; also 1.5; 4.4.3)  
• Revised section 3.1.3 to indicate that patients with BRAFV600K are also eligible in 
addition to BRAFV600E, as the dabrafenib/trametinib combination is FDA approved in 
both populations. 
• Added section 3.1.7 clarifying that prior anti- cancer treatment related toxicities must 
have resolved prior to enrollment. 
• Detailed information added to section 3.1.9 on what constitutes effective 
contraception, and st atement referencing this information added to inclusion criteria 
3.1.10. 
• Exclusion criteria 3.2.2 added ( History of malignancy with confirmed activating RAS 
mutation at any time. Note : Prospective RAS testing is not required. However, if the 
results of pre vious RAS testing are known, they must be used in assessing eligibility) 
• Minor clarifications added to exclusion criteria 3.2.8, 3.2.11, and 3.2.14

 Biopsies 
Modified section 4.2 on timing of biopsies and removed statement that biopsy must be ‘core’ 
biopsy.  (section 6.6 and 6.8) Clarified that biopsies may be delayed beyond point of disease 
progression if patient remains on therapy.  The decision to continue therapy should be based on 
clinical benefit and safety considerations. Also updated in key to table of time and events (section 
6.1, 6.4.1 and 6.7).    
Deleted statement that maximum number of biopsy passes is 4.  The maximum number of passes 
will be determined by treating physicians based upon considerations of safety.  
 
Blood Sample 
For those patients who do not co-enroll into LCCC1108, we will ask for a blood sample (~8mLs) 
to ensure sufficient germline DNA in the event tissue samples are insufficient. This change is 
reflected in section 1.6, section 6, 6.2 and 6.8 
 Management and Dose Modifications (section 4.4)  
Deleted ‘interstitial lung disease’ as safety issues mostly for pneumonitis  
Updated information on management based on most recent template language from GSK (section 4.4.3.1 on hypertension; 4.4.1.1 table on rash; 4.4.2 malignancies, 4.4.3.2 table on QTc 
prolongation; 4.4.3.3 reduced LVEF; 4.4.4  visual changes; section 4.4.5 pneumonitis; section 
4.4.6 renal insufficiency; 4.4. 7 diarrhea; 4.4.8 pyrexia; 4.4.9.1 (liver chemistry stopping criteria) 
and added sections on new primary melanoma (4.4.2.2)  non- cutaneous malignancies (4.4.2.3), 
pancreatitis (4.4.10) and hyperglycemia (4.4.11). Updated section 4.4.12 (non- specifi c toxicities 
attributable to drug therapy)  
Concomitant Medications (section 4.5) 
Added investigational drugs to the list of prohibited medications, and added section 4.5.3 on 
dabrafenib and radiation. 
 
Time and Events  Table  
In footnotes to table (section 6.1) clarified biopsy timing and timing of tumor imaging. At recommendation of manufacturer, added additional ophthalmic exams at cycles 2, 8 and annually 
thereafter. Regardless of progression/non -progression, clarified that patients will be evaluated 
(receive mandated study assessments) every 2 cycles or 6 weeks after cycle 9. (sections 6.1, 6.3 
and 6.3.5) Consolidated study assessments. Widened study window for lab screening assessments to within 21 days prior to therapy initiation. Widened study windows for cycle 9 and beyond to 
+/-5 days.

The main driver for this amendment was to increase the window of time for screening for all but 
the laboratory evaluations  and baseline tumor biopsy from 1 week to 3 weeks, to 
expand/reorganize the T&E table so that we each study visit for the first 6 months is included in 
the table, to clarify the timing of the biopsies at progression, and to include specific information for affiliate sites as the study is changing to multicenter.   These changes are reflected in sections 
4.2, 6.0 (Time and Events table), and sections 6.2-6.7.  
In addition, the 2 medications included in the study were FDA approved as of May 2013, and this 
information has been incorporated into the study.  These changes are reflected in sections 1.1, 1.3, 
and 1.4.   
Safety and drug interaction i nformation : Since this trial was initially approved in 2012, new 
IBs for each individual agent were issued by the manufacturer.  In addition, a new IB for the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib was issued in May of 2013.  Updated safety 
information ( including drug interaction information) from each of these documents was 
incorporated into the protocol. These changes are reflected in sections 1.4.1, 1.5, 4.4.2.2., 4.4.3, 
4.4.4, 4.4.7, 4.5.2, 5.1.5, 5.2.5, 5.2.7, and 5.2.8, and Appendix C section 11.3.  
 
Eligibility  
Section 3.1.7 was revised to indicate that the pre-treatment biopsy required by the protocol should 
not be performed until all other eligibility criteria are confirmed. 
 
Section 3.1.8: females of child-bearing potential must continue effective contraception until 16 
(not 4 weeks) post the last dose of study medication.  Men with a female partner of childbearing 
potential must agree to effective contraception from D1 of study treatment (not 14 days prior to D1 as written previously). 
 
Biopsies:  
Section 4.2, Time and Events footnote 11, and sections 6.4, 6.7.: These sections were revised to 
indicate that tissue at baseline does not have to be from the original diagnostic specimen, but from any site.  If tissue is not available, a core biopsy can be obtained from any site, not restricted 
to target lesions.  Repeat biopsies were already required at progression. However, the timing was clarified with amendment #1 to indicate they should be performed within 7 business days of 
documented progression, a nd optimally within 4 hours of that day’s study medication.  Post-
treatment biopsies will be not required for patients removed from the study for reasons other than

 disease progression.  Sections 4.1, 4.2, 6.4 and 6.7 were revised to indicate that patients will be 
requested to stay on study medication until the post progression biopsy is performed. 
 
Section 6.9.3 Evaluation of Target lesions: 
A note was added to this section NOTE:  Whenever possible, a biopsied lesion should not be 
considered a target lesion  for RECIST tumor assessments.  If the biopsied lesion is the only site 
of measurable disease, it may only be followed as a target lesion if a core biopsy was 
performed.  Lesions that have been completely removed or subjected to excisional biopsy should 
not be followed as target lesions.   
 
Time and Events:  
In addition to the logistical changes and details on biopsies noted above, the footnotes were revise 
to specify that the end of treatment visit should be performed 30 days after the last dose of study 
medication, and to allow dermatologic evaluations to be performed at an MD office local to the 
patient if the patient is not scheduled to come to the clinic.  It was also emphasized that a scan of the brain is not required post- baseline unless clinically ind icated.   
 In addition, the following editorial changes were made:  
The PI was changed from Frances Collichio, MD to Carrie Lee MD, MPH.  Dr. Collichio remains 
as a co -investigator.   
 Section 4.3: This section was revised to indicate that if a patient misses a dose of dabrafenib, they may make this dose up, provided it is >6 hours until the next dose.  If a patient misses a dose of 
trametinib, they may make this dose up, provided it is >12 hours until the next dose.   
 Sections 4.8 and 4.9 (Removal of Patients, Patient Replacement, and Study Withdrawal) were 
added to reconcile with the newest LCCC protocol template.  
 
Section 6.9 was revised to emphasize that tissue at progression must be available to render a 
patient evaluable for the primary endpoint.  The following statement was added: If a patient drops 
out of the study prior to progression, they may be replaced.

1 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This multicenter phase II study in 20 patients with BRAFV600mutant disease 
(specifically BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K designated as BRAFV600E/K), unresectable 
stage III/IV melanoma is designed to explore the mechanisms by which tumors 
acquire resistance to the combination of a B RAF inhibitor (dabrafenib;Tafinlar®) 
and MEK inhibitor (trametinib;Mekinist® ).  Tissue will be collected at baseline  
and at progression. If a subject is removed from the study for one of a variety of 
reasons including, but not limited to, an  inability to tolerate the combination of 
dabrafenib and trametinib, a need to receive other therapy or completion of 3-
years of study treatment without progression, and the subject later receives, as part of his/her standard of care, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib and progresses on the standard of care regimen, then the subject may be contacted by the  treating physician to be put back on to the LCCC 1128 protocol and have a progression biopsy at this progression time point.   Markers of resi stance will be 
explored by performing near kinome-wide profiling on tumor samples, and in patients who co-enroll in institutional protocol LCCC1108, by sequencing tumors using NextGen DNA sequencing technology.  Overall response rate and duration to this c ombination will also be assessed.   
1.2 Melanoma  
Melanoma is the sixth most common malignancy in the United States and its incidence is increasing faster than any other cancer [1, 2].  Patients with 
metastatic melanoma have a median life expectancy of only 8 months.  In the extension cohort from a recent phase I trial of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib , 
81% (2 6 of 32) of patients with BRAF
V600E /K melanoma experienced at least 30% 
tumor shrinkage by RECIST with a complete response seen in two patients [ 3].  
However, resistance to PLX4032 emerged after response durations of 2 to more than 18 months.  Several key resistance mechanisms have been described and warrant further investigation.  These mechanisms include new functional mutations in one of five established resistance genes (BRAF, NRAS, MEK1, MAP3K8 or COT, and PTEN).    MEK is a key protein integral to the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In BRAF mutant melanoma, MEK activation drives disease proliferation.  Therefore, it is hypothesized that the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition is likely to 
have less downstream resistance than BRAF inhibition alone.   
1.3 Trametinib  
Trametinib is a reversible and highly selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2.  These characteristics, along with its long half -life, small 
peak/trough ratio and limited inter -subject variability in its pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile, render it an excellent MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor to evaluate in human trials. [4]  Trametinib is approved as monotherapy and in combination with

2 dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. 
1.3.1 Effects in Humans  
The effect of trametinib in subjects with a variety of cancers has been evaluated in a number of studies, and additional studies are ongoing.[ 4]  Trametinib has been 
administered as monotherapy in at least 9 of these studies, and as combination 
therapy in at least  10 additional  studies. Please also review the package insert s for 
trametinib and dabrafenib for updated background information on each product.   Preliminary trametinib pharmacokinetics (PK) was determined after single - and 
repeat dose oral administration of trametinib tablets in subjects with solid tumors. 
Trametinib is absorbed rapidly with median Tmax generally occurring within 1-3 hours after oral administration of trametinib under fasting conditions. Following repeat -dosing the mean area under the curve (AUC0-τ ) and maximum 
concentrations (Cmax) increased in an approximately dose proportional manner. 
Trametinib accumulates with repeat dosing with a mean effective half -life at a 
dose of 2 mg of approximately 4 days.  
 
In vitro , the metabolism of trametinib  is mediated  predominant ly by non-CYP -
mediated processes, via deacetylation alone, or with monooxygenation or in 
combination with glucuronidation biotransformation pathways. No formal clinical 
trials have been conducted to evaluate human cytochrome P450 (CYP)  enzyme -mediated dru g interactions with trametinib. Co -administration of 
trametinib (2mg per day) with the CYP3A 4 inducer dabrafeninb (150mg BID) resulted in no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions (trametinib package insert; January 2014). This protocol prohibits or cautions against the use of medications with the potential for drug interactions with dabrafenib.  See section 4.5 (Concomitant Medications) and section 11.2 (Appendices) for the categories of medications that are prohibited and/or to be used with caution.  
 
Based on the adverse events (AEs) observed in the dose escalation phase of the 
first-time-in-human (FTIH) study MEK111054, the maximum tolerated dose was 
established at 3.0 mg once daily (QD), and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of tramet inib was identified as 2.0 mg QD. 
 
Pharmacodynamics  
Pre- and post- (day 15) treatment tumor biopsies were performed for evaluation of 
pharmacodynamic (PD) markers in patients with metastatic melanoma in the first monotherapy trial of trametinib conducted (MEK111054).   Doses remained stable for the 15 days of treatment and were 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0mg/day.  PD markers evaluated included percent change from baseline of pERK, Ki67, and p27.  Trough levels of trametinib were also obtained at day 15.   PD responses in this 
study were dose- related, with minimal PD effects seen at 0.5mg/day, and  robust 
changes reported at 2.0mg/day. The median change observed at a dose of 2 mg

3 daily was 62% inhibition of pERK, 83% inhibition of Ki67, and a 175% increase 
in p27, confirming inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway.   Correlations were also reported between PD response and trough concentrations of trametinib on day 15.  Monte Carlo simulations predict that 86% of subjects will exceed the target concentration of 10ng/mL at the 2mg/day dose.   Trametinib 2.0 mg once daily was administered in the Phase II and Phase III studies. After accounting for the effect of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a known prognostic marker in subjects with melanoma, subjects with exposure above the median value had longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those below the median ex posure with hazard ratio (HR) <1. The relationship with exposure was 
more pronounced in the Phase II study compared to the Phase III study which may be related to the lower  exposure observed in subjects enrolled in the Phase II 
study. The higher exposure in the Phase III study may suggest that the drug response is starting to plateau and data are less likely to show /an exposure-response.[ 4]   
 
Safety and Efficacy  
The most common adverse reactions in the trametinib arm (n=211) from the randomized, open- label study of trametinib versus chemotherapy in patients with 
BRAF
 V600E or V600 K mutation –positive melanoma  included the following:  rash 
(57%),  dermatitis acneiform (19%), dry skin (11%), pruritus (10%), paronychia 
(10%),  diarrhea ( 43%), stomatitis (15%), abdominal pain (13%), lymphedema 
(32%), hypertension (15%), and hemorrhage (13 %). 
 See section 5.1 and the trametinib Investigator’s Brochure for additional safety information on trametinib and section 1.5 for safety and efficacy data when trametinib is combined with dabrafenib in BRAF mutant melanoma.  
1.4 Dabrafenib  
Dabrafenib is a potent and selective inhibitor of BRAF kinase, and  inhibits phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in vitro , inhibits cell proliferation, and 
achieved tumor regression in xenograft cancer models that encode BRAF
V600E.[5]  
Dabrafenib is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutatio ns, and in 
combination with trametinib  for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600 K mutations 
 
Dabrafenib is under development for the treatment of advanced cancer subjects with BRAF mutant tumors, which have been identified at a high frequency in specific cancers including approximately 40 -60% of melanoma, 30 to 50% of 
papillary thyroid, 5 to 20% of colorectal cancer, and approximately 30% of ovarian cancer.

and dabrafenib for updated background information on each product and the 
number of clinical trials ongoing.  
1.4.1 Effects in Humans  
The effect of dabrafenib  in subjects with a variety of cancers has been evaluated 
in a number of studies, and additional studies are ongoing. [ 5] 
 
Pharmacokinetics  
Two metabolites of dabrafenib were characterized and may contribute to the 
clinical activity of this drug. GSK2285403 (hydroxy- metabolite) 
pharmacokinetics paralleled that of parent while the desmethyl - (GSK2167542) 
metabolites exhibited a longer half -life and accumulated following rep eat dosing. 
Similar to parent concentrations, exposure for all metabolites showed a less than dose proportional increase with repeat dosing.  Results following single dose administration showed a total recovery of radioactivity of 93.8 % of the dose with f ecal excretion being the major route of 
elimination, accounting for 71.1% of the dose.  The current recommendation is to administer dabrafenib under fasting conditions, either one hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Preliminary results of the food 
effect study showed a decrease in dabrafenib Cmax and AUC(0-
∞) after single 
dose administration. 
 Preliminary results of the effect of repeat dose administration of dabrafenib 150 mg BID on the single dose pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe, showed a decrease in midazolam exposure, indicating that dabrafenib induces CYP3A4 -mediated metabolism (moderate to potent).  It may also induce 
other 
enzymes such as CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, as well as UDP 
glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) and transporters.  Co-administration of dabrafenib 
and drugs that are affected by the induction of these enzymes may result in 
decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy. In preliminary studies, dabrafenib 
was a substrate for human P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and murine breas t cancer resistant 
protein 1 (Bcrp1) in vitro . However, these transporters have minimal impact on 
dabrafenib oral bioavailability and elimination, and the risk of a drug- drug 
interaction is minimal. [5] 
 In addition, CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are involved in the oxidative metabolism of dabrafenib. In vitro , selective inhibitors 
of CYP 2C8 and CYP3A4 reduced the intrinsic clearance of dabrafenib. These results suggested that dabrafenib has the potential of being a victim of drug- drug 
interactions upon co- administration with  strong CYP2C8  and CYP3A4  inhibitors 
and inducers.[ 5]

5 This protocol prohibits or caution against the use of medications with the potential 
for drug interactions with dabrafenib and/or trametinib.   See section 4.5 (Concomitant Medications) and section 11.2 (Appendices) for the categories of medications that a re prohibited and/or to be used with caution.   
 
Pharmacodynamics  
Based on results from the dose escalation part of Study BRF112680 (Part 1) in patients with V600 mutant-positive melanoma, 150mg BID is predicted to provide, on average, adequate inhibition of pERK (80%). [ 5]  
 
Safety as Monotherapy  
As summarized in the table below (from the dabrafenib 2014 IB)[ 5] the following 
adverse events were considered related to dabrafenib when administered as monotherapy across company-sponsored clinical trials (n=578).  Approximately 30% of these p atients  received dabrafenib treatment for >6 months. Frequencies 
are as follows: very common (≥10%), common (≥1% and <10%), uncommon 
(≥0.01% and <1%), and rare (≥0.01% and <0.1%).

6 1.5 Safety and Efficacy when Dabrafenib Combined with Trametinib 
To date over 1000 subjects, most with BRAF V600-mutated melanoma, have 
received the combination of these two drugs across the manufacturer’s sponsored studies.  Most of the safety data (as summarized in the June 2014 Investigator’s Brochure of this combination) are from the randomized phase III double blind placebo controlled trial comparing this combination (n=209) to dabrafenib monotherapy (n=211), and study BRF113220.  Study BRF 113220 is designed to 
investigate the safety, PK and PD of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive solid tumors.  The study consists of 4 parts: Part A evaluated the effect of repeat doses of trametinib on the PK of single -dose dabrafenib;  Part B was a dose- escalation phase to determine the 
safety, tolerability and range of tolerated doses for the drugs in combination; Part C is a randomized phase II study to determine the clinical activity of the 
combination in patients with BRAF mutation positive melanoma ; and Part D 
evaluated the PK of dabrafenib administered in combination with trametinib. Administration of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of trametin ib or of dabrafenib relative to 
administration of either compound alone. [ 6] 
1.5.1 Summary Safety Information of th e Combination 
Most subjects treated with combination therapy experienced an adverse event. In both studies, pyrexia was the most frequently reported AE, and the most frequently reported grade 3 event (presented with *) in subjects treated with combination therapy (51%/6%*) in Study MEK115306 and 57%/4%* in Study BRF113220). AEs that occurred in >30% of subjects treated with combination therapy in either study included pyrexia, fatigue, vomiting, chills, nausea, and headache.  
 Grade 4 AEs reported in more than a single subject treated with combination therapy included neutropenia (3 subjects in Study BRF113220) pyrexia (2 subjects in Study BRF113220). AEs leading to permanent discontinuation were reported in <10% of subjects treated with combination therapy i n either study.  
 The most common SAEs in both studies were pyrexia and chills. Fatal SAEs have been reported in 4 subjects in the combination therapy arm in Study MEK115306 and 3 subjects in the 3 subjects in the 150mg/2 mg combination therapy arm in the 
Study BRF113220 pooled combination therapy population. One fatal SAE was 
reported in 2 subjects in Study MEK115306 (cerebral hemorrhage).   In general, the overall profile of AEs of special interest observed in subjects treated with combination therapy is co nsistent with the known profiles of each 
separate drug. The most notable differences were the increase in Grade 3 pyrexia and hepatic events and the decrease in skin -related toxicities with combination 
therapy relative to monotherapy.

7 1.5.2 Special Warnings for the Combination 
Ocular safety  
Both trametinib and dabrafenib have been associated with ocular toxicities which 
appear to be class effects, including retinal pigment, papilledema, retinal pigment 
epithelial detachment (RPED ; previously called central serous retinopathy or 
CSR) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) associated with trametinib, and uveitis (including chorioretinitis,  choroiditis, retinitis, vitritis, cyclitis, iridocyclitis, iritis, 
and uveitis) associated with dabrafenib. When all ocular events were considered together (blurred vision, dry eye, visual impairment and RPED ), the incidence 
was 25%.  With the exception of the single case of grade 3 RPED , all ocular 
events were grade 1 or 2. [6] In the MEK115306 study, ocular events occurred in 
11% of patients in each arm, with no cases of RVO reported. Two subjects in the combination therapy arm had grade 3 ocular events (uveitis and iridocyclitis) considered related to study treatment.  
 
Cutaneous s quamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC)  
In vitro  experiments have demonstrated a paradoxical activation of MAP -kinase 
signaling  in kerationcytes and potentially other cells harboring a wild- type BRAF  
kinase but a mutated RAS kinase upon exposure to a BRAF inhibitor. This paradoxical  MAP -kinase pathway activation is potentially associated with a 
higher risk for the development of cu SCC induction. 
 Cases of cuSCC have been reported in patients treated with dabrafenib in 
combination with trametinib. In BRF113220 Part C, cuSCC occurred in 7% of 
subjects combination therapy arm at the dose used in LCCC1128 compared to 
19% of subjects receiving dabrafenib monotherapy. In patients who received the 
combination dose of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib, events occurred later t han with dabrafenib monotherapy with the median time to onset of 22 
weeks. All patients on combination therapy who developed cuSCC continued on dabrafenib treatment without dose modification.   In the phase II I study (MEK115306), the BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination 
was found to significantly reduce the incidence of secondary cuSCC  which 
occurred in  9% of patients receiving dabrafenib monotherapy compared with 2% 
with the combination. The median time to onset of the first occurrence of cuSCC 
was 222 days in the combination arm and 57 days in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. 
 
Non-cutaneous secondary/recurrent malignancy  
In vitro  experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP -kinase 
signalling  in BRAF wild type cells with RAS mutations which are exposed to 
BRAF inhibitors, which may lead to increased risk of non- cutaneous 
malignancies in patients treated with  dabrafenib. Cases of RAS -driven 
malignancies have been seen with BRAF inhibitors  including dabrafenib, and 
with dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Patients  should be monitored as 
clinically appropriate.

8  
Pyrexia  
The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased when dabrafenib is combine 
with trametinib. When each drug is prescribe at its approved dose in combination, nearly half of the first occurrences of pyrexia occur within the first month of therapy, and ~ one- half of patients who experience this side effect had a single 
event . The majority of pyrexia events resolved in both arms[ 6]. 
 
 
Rash  
In Part C  of BRAF113220, 65% of subjects at the doses used in LCCC1128 
experienced at least one event of skin- related toxicity. This incidence of skin -
related events reported with the combination  regimen appears to be lower than  
what has been observed in the t rametinib  monotherapy trials  (~88%). The  most 
frequent skin- related toxicities affecting over  10% of subjects in Part C were rash, 
dermatitis acneiform, erythema, and generalized rash. The incidence and severity of the majority of skin -related toxicities  and especially those most often seen with 
either trametinib   or dabrafenib  therapy appear to b e reduced when both 
compounds are combined.[ 6] In study MEK115306, the percentage of rash was 
similar between treatment arms (34% in the combination (none grade 3) and 30% (~20% grade 3) in the dabrafenib monotherapy arms). Dermatitis acneiform occurred with increased frequency in the combination arm (8%) as compared to 3% in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. 
1.5.3 Other Safety Considerations for the Combination 
Pre-renal and Intrinsic Renal Failure  
In Part C  of study 113220, 1 subject (150mg/1mg) experienced grade 2 renal 
failure and 4 (at the 150mg/2mg doses ) experienced grade 3 renal failure.  In 
study MEK115306, the incidence of renal failure events was similar (3% in the combination and 2% for dabrafenib monotherapy).  
 Pancreatitis  
Six subjects in BRF113220 had acute pancreatitis or pancreatitis, 3 of which were 
grade 4 and considered related to study treatment. [6] The time to onset to 
pancreatitis occurred at a median of 138 days. One event of pancreatitis was 
reported in each treatment arm of study MEK115306.  
Hemorrhage 
Combination t reatment  resulted in an increased incidence and severity of 
hemorrhagic events: 16% (9/55) of patients treated with the combination compared with 2% (1/53) of patients treated with dabrafenib alone. Intracranial hemorrhage was fatal in two (4%) patients receiving the combination. 
Venous Thromboembolic Events 
Treatment with the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib resulted in an increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism

9 (PE): 7% (4/55) of patients compared with none of the 53 patients treated with 
dabrafenib as a single agent. One (2%) patient receiving combination therapy experienced a fatal pulmonary embolism. 
 
Hyperglycemia  
Hyperglycemia may increase in occurrence when combination trametinib and 
dabrafenib are used. The incidence of Grade 3 hyperglycemia based on laboratory values was 5% (3/55) in patients treated with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib compared with 2% (1/53) in patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent.  
1.5.4 AEs of Special Interest  
AEs of special interest were identified independently for both the dabrafenib and trametinib programs based on preclinical observations, the frequency of the events occurring in early clinical trials, and the potential association with the mode of action of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. AEs of special interest that are associated with trametinib (MEK category AEs) are:  
• Skin- related toxic ities (e.g., rash – generalized, macular, 
maculopapular,pruritic, erythematous; dermatitis acneiform; erythema; skin exfoliation; palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES ; also 
known as hand foot skin reaction or HFSR) 
• Diarrhea  
• Ocular events (e.g., RVO, chorioretinopathy) • Hepatic events (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase [AST], ALT, and blood 
bilirubin  increased)  
• Cardiac- related events (e.g., LVEF decreased and left ventricular 
dysfunction) • Hypertension  
• Pneumonitis  
 
AEs of special interest that are associated with dabrafenib (BRAF category AEs) 
are: 
• Pyrexia  
• Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma • PPES 
• Renal failure (renal failure, renal failure acute)  
• Other treatment emergent malignancies  
• New primary malignant melanoma  
• Uveitis  
 
In general, the overall profile of AEs of special interest observed with the 
combination in the Part C 150/2 group is consistent with the known profiles of each separate drug, the most notable differences being the increase in pyrexia and the decrease in s kin-related toxicities with combination therapy relative to 
monotherapy. The incidence of MEK- related AEs of special interest in the Part C

10 150/2 group occurred at a rate (91%) that was similar to the incidence reported in 
the trametinib integrated summary  of safety (ISS) population (94%) and higher 
than the incidence in the dabrafenib ISS population (55%).   MEK -related events of skin -related toxicities, diarrhea and hypertension  
 appeared to be lower in the Part C 150/2 group compared with the trametinib ISS 
population, while the incidence rate of ocular events was higher relative to the trametinib ISS population.  For BRAF -related AEs of special interest, the incidence of any event in the Part C 
150/2 group was higher (84%) than either the dabrafenib ISS population (49%) or the trametinib ISS population (19%). This increase is predominantly due to the increased incidence of pyrexia observed with combination treatment. Also noted were an increase in renal failure reports and a decrease in cuSCC and PPES reports when comparing the Part C 150/2 group to the dabrafenib ISS 
population.[ 6] 
 An overview of AEs of specia l interest at dose levels in Part C of BRF113220 is 
provided in the appendices, section 0.  Other AEs of special interest noted in the randomized phase III (MEK115306) trial (in addition to those listed above) included basal cell carcinoma, hemorrhages, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and neutropenia.  An overview of AEs of special interest in MEK115306 is provided in the appendices, section 11.8. 
1.5.5 Efficacy of Combination 
The dose ranging trial (Part B  of BRF113220) evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
150mg dabrafenib twice daily plus trametinib (at d oses of 2mg QD or 1 mg BID) 
versus dabrafenib150mg BID. A total of 162 patients with advanced melanoma 
and BRAF V600E/K  mutations were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, with 54 patients 
in each arm who had not previously received BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Primary efficacy outcome was investigator –assessed ORR; median duration of follow-up 
was 14 months.  In the trametinib 2 mg once daily arm, ORR was 76% versus 54% for dabrafenib monotherapy. Thus, the recommended combination dose is 150 mg dabrafenib twice daily plus 2mg trametinib once daily. The median duration of response was 10.5 months for combination therapy versus 5.6 months for patients on single-agent dabrafenib. See the package insert for further information.     In January 2014, the FDA approved the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib for treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. This indication is based upon demonstration of durable response rate.

11 The MEK115306 (COMBI-d) study of dabrafenib 150 mg BID and trametinib 
2mgQD in combination versus single-agent dabrafenib sought to verify the clinical benefit of combination dabrafenib and trametinib. An analysis of investigator -assessed PFS after 211 (out of 423 patients) PFS events showed a 
25% percent reduction in risk of progression or death (HR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; per = 0.035).  Median PFS for the combination therapy arm was 9.3 months compared with 8.8 months for the dabrafenib monotherapy arm.[ 6] 
1.6 Correlative Studies  
As described below, tumors will undergo near kinome-wide profiling using a mass -spectrometry -based, unbiased proprietary technology ( Kinomining
TM) 
developed by Dr. Gary Johnson and colleagues at UNC.  Tumor samples from patients who co-enroll in LCCC1108 will also be sequenced for approximately 150-200 genes of known importance in oncogenic signaling using NextGen DNA sequencing technol ogy on the Illumina HiS eq platform.  Both of these 
technologies can be performed with minimal amounts of patient sample.  In addition, melanoma is a good disease for this study as the relatively young and otherwise healthy patients often have accessible disease and are good candidates for re -biopsy at the time of progression.  At the time of consent, patients enrolled 
from affiliate sites will be informed that collection of their tumor tissue (both at baseline and at progression) is expected to take place at UNC whenever possible.  
For those patients who do not co-enroll into LCCC1108, we will ask for a blood 
sample (~8mLs) to ensure sufficient germline DNA in the event tissue samples are insufficient.  
1.6.1 Kinomining
TM  
Dr. Gary Johnson and colleagues have developed a chemical proteomics approach to define the activity of a significant percentage (60%) of the expressed kinome in cells and tumors.[ 7] The technique involves the use of pan kinase inhibitors 
immobilized on beads to capture a large percentage of expressed kinases in cells and tumors. The activation state of more than 60% of the expressed kinome, defined by RNA- seq, can be analyzed using mass spectrometry analysis of the 
captured kinases.   This technique has been used to study, and then rationally design a kinase inhibitor combination therapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Analysis of a patient TNBC tissue sample showed activated RAF -MEK1/2 -ERK1/2 
signaling, supporting MEK as a target in TNBC. In TNBC cells and tumors of a genetically engineered C3Tag mouse model (GEMM) of TNBC, MEK inhibition with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 led to rapid reprogramming of the expression and activity of a group of Tyr and Ser/Thr kinases.  This reprogramming bypassed the original MEK -ERK inhibition and demonstrated the resilient nature of the 
kinome.  Mechanistically, we showed that acute MEK in hibitor treatment caused 
MEK -ERK activity loss resulting in rapid c -Myc degradation, inducing the 
expression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and ERK reactivation.  RNAi knockdown of c-Myc induced RTK expression similarly to MEK

12 inhibition.  Ba sed on these results, we predicted and tested a novel small molecule 
combination therapy of MEK inhibitor and sorafenib for TNBC. The combination 
synergistically caused apoptosis and tumor regression in the C3Tag GEMM of basal -like/claudin -low TNBC, wherea s the single agents of MEK inhibitor or 
sorafenib were largely ineffective.  [7] 
 The research described above, along with siRNA screens of the kinome in cell lines, is identifying previously untargeted kinases essential for tumor growth and survival.  Our belief is that the approach can be extended to human tumors.  
1.6.2 UNCs eq
TM 
Clinical sequencing efforts at UNC have settled on the in solution hybrid capture methodology using the Illumina platform for downstream sequencing. This technology allows gene targets of interest to be isolated from genome- wide high -
throughput sequencing libraries, reducing both sequencing costs and bioinformatic complexity downstream. This approach is also highly customizable, allow for changes in gene targets with little additional cost or need for re -
optimization.   At UNC in the Clinical Sequencing Program (UNC seq
TM), we are 
applying this technology to patients suffering from a diverse variety of malignancies with funds provided by the State of NC through the University Cancer Research Fund.   UNC seq allows us to tailor therapy to a patient’s cancer 
based on the tumor’s molecular genetics, thereby improving response rate and decreasing the toxicity from exposure to ineffective a gents.  
 We have an extensive unpublished experience in melanoma.   For example, we 
have performed UNCs eq on 52 melanoma samples with a capture approach 
restricted to 75 genes previously reported to harbor somatic mutations in this disease. These samples were run through a UNC-developed sample preparation and informatic pipeline to identify diverse kinds of genetic variants.  This process was informed by UNC’s efforts in the far-larger tumor sequencing program, the Cancer Genome Atlas, of which UNC is one of 8 participating centers in North America.  Our results greatly surpassed gold standard Sanger sequencing.   For 
example, we identified all validated BRAF V600 and NRAS Q61 codon mutations found by Sanger sequencing: (BRAF 46% of tumors; NRAS 17%).   Deep sequencing also allowed identification of pathogenic mutations in 
many additional genes reported to be mutated in melanoma (KIT, CDKn2a, PTEN, LKB1); and identified novel functional mutations of BRAF and other kinases. In one BRAF/NRAS wild- type melanoma, we found a clear codon 12 
activating KRAS mutation (Fig 1), which is reported to be present in ~1% of melanoma.   KRAS mutation is not routinely assayed in melanoma at any major 
center, but would have clear implications for the testing of BRAF and MEK inhibitors.   Additionally, we found numerous frameshift (Fig 2), missense, nonsense and large deletion mutations in tumor suppressor genes (PTEN, CDKN2A, p53, LKB1). These mutations, found in many regions along the coding sequence,

13 would be difficult and expensive to assay by other technologies. We have also 
used normalized read counts to identify somatic Copy Number Variations (CNVs = deletions and amplifications) and potentially structural variation like chromosomal translocations without any modifications to the sample preparation pipeline.  Data comparing X chromosome dosage in normal male and female tissues indicates that our approach can detect single copy loss with high statistical precision, suggesting most pathogenic CNVs will be obvious by this approach.  UNC seq offers a powerful new tool to assay known genetic factors for therapy 
and also to discover novel clinically relevant somatic mutations. The technique can effectively assay the diverse mutations that disable tumor suppressor genes, allowing an expl oration of the clinical consequences of these genetic events 
which to date have been poorly characterized in other contexts. We expect this system will become indispensable to all stages of clinical care, including diagnosis, prognosis, treatment prediction, and drug discovery.

1.7 Rationale 
BRF113220, the phase I/II trial of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib  in combination 
with the MEK inhibitor trametinib  in metastatic melanoma establish ed the safety 
of this combination, and identified the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) for 
each agent.  Expansion cohorts at the RP2D for these drugs in combination were 
included in the phase I to characterize the safety in  more detail, and to explore the 
efficacy of this combination.  The combination was well tolerated as described in section 1.5, with decreased frequency of rash compared to either agent alone. [5, 
8]   This study will utilize the RP2D determined in the Phase I/II study: trametinib  
2mg QD and dabrafenib  150 mg BID.  Despite a very promising overall response 
rate of 81%, these patients will also likely go on to develop resistance as a result of new resistance mutations , and given the cooperative signaling network of 
kinases that sense inhibition of key nodal kinases and induce compensatory responses that offset pharmacological intervention.    The present phase II study in 20 patients with BRAF
V600E /K mutant, unresectable 
stage III/IV melanoma is designed to explore the mechanis ms by which tumors 
acquire resistance to the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition.  Overall 
response rate and duration to this combination will also be assessed.    Tissue will be collected at baseline and at progression  (clinical or radiological)  or 
beyond progression  pending the availability of sufficient tissue and considerations 
of patient safety .  Patients may remain on treatment after progression (at the 
discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still experiencing clinical benefit , as targeted therapy post-progression may extend survival. A recent

15 analysis has shown that continuation on a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib or 
vemurafenib) as monotherapy after disease progression may improve survival.  Among 36 patients who continued on treatment, post progression median PFS was 6.9 months versus 3.9 months among those (n=56) who discontinued treatment at progression (p=0.001).  Furthermore, median OS was 17.8 months from start of BRAF therapy versus only 7.0 months in those who stopped treatm ent at progression (p<0.001). [ 9]

defined as 3 weeks in duration.   Cycles will be repeated until disease progression  
(clinical or radiological).  Patients may remain on treatment after progression (at the discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still experiencing clinical benefit . Patients will be requeste d to remain on study medication until the biopsy 
at progression is performed.    Patients will have a biopsy at baseline and at progression.   Some subject s may be 
removed from study prior to progression for other reasons that include, but are not limited to, an  inability to tolerate the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, a 
need to  receive other therapy,  or completion of 3- years of study treatment without 
progression. If one of these subjects later receives the combination  of dabrafenib 
and trametinib  per his/her standard of care treatment plan, then the subject may 
re-consented for  a biopsy upon progression. These subjects are required to 
consent to re-enter the study for the purposes of having a progression biopsy.  Kinomining
TM and NextGen Sequencing (in patients who co-enroll into 
LCCC1108) will be done on baseline and progression biopsies to look for changes in kinome expression and mutations in resistance genes. 
4.2 Biopsies  
At baseline, if patient does not have frozen tissue available (see section 6.6) fresh tissue  must be obtained.  If possible, the pre-treatment biopsy should be 
performed after all other eligibility criteria are confirmed.   Enough tissue will be collected for both kinomining and NextGen sequencing if available (see section 
6.6).    Fresh tissue collection of accessible tumor will be repeated at progression 
(clinical or radiological)  whether patient continues treatment post progression or

22 not.  In fact, patients will be requested to remain on study medication until the 
biopsy at progression is performed.  For subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment, but are later placed  back on the trametinib/dabrafenib combination 
therapy , a biopsy may be collected from the former study subject at the time of 
progression from the standard of care trametinib/dabrafenib therapy.   These 
subjects must be consented and placed back on study to allow for attainment of a biopsy at progression. These subjects w ill then remain on study for safety 
monitoring, in relation to the biopsy procedure, for 30 days. Subjects  who have an 
ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) related to the study procedure at 30 days will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by the investigator.  
 If possible, biopsies at progression should be performed within 7 business days of documented disease progression, and optimally within 4 hours of taking that day’s study medication. If treating physician decides  to continue treatment because the 
patient exhibits continued clinical benefit from therapy (and the patient agrees) then the biopsy can be delayed until the investigator deems the biopsy feasible as long as patient safety is not compromised. Post- treatmen t biopsies will not be 
required for patients removed for reasons other than disease progression; although, as mentioned above, if these subjects then go on to eventually receive the trametinib/dabrafenib combination in the future, as part of their standard of care, of the subject may be re- consented at the time of  disease progression

Drug  Dose, Route & 
Schedule  Cycle  
Trametinib  2 mg orally once daily  Every 3 weeks  
Dabrafenib  150mg orally twice daily  Every 3 weeks  
 
• After the pre- treatment biopsy is complete, patients will begin  2.0 mg of 
trametinib orally once per day in combination with dabrafenib 150mg PO BID.   
• Patients will be instructed to take their dabrafenib at approximately the 
same time each day. The eveni ng dose of dabrafenib should be 
administered approximately 12 hours after the morning dose.   
• Both drugs should be administered under fasting conditions, either one hour before or 2 hours after a meal, and with approximately eight ounces of water.   
• If a s ubject vomits after taking study medication, the subject should be 
instructed not to retake the dose and should take the next scheduled dose. 
• If a patient misses a dose  of dabrafenib, it should not be taken if it is less 
than 6 hours until the next dose.  If a dose of trametinib is missed, the dose should only be taken if it is more than 12 hours until the next scheduled dose.

23 • Any missed dose should be noted on the patient diary (provided as a 
document separate from the protocol-see Appendices, section 11.6, for a model diary).  
 
Note: loperamide should be made available prior to start of study treatment to 
patient so loperamide administration can begin at the first signs of diarrhea  (see 
section 4.4.6). 
4.4 Dose Modifications for Trametinib and Dabrafenib for Toxicity 
See sections 5.1.5, 5.2.5, and appendices (section11.3), and the respective IBs for 
additional information on drug- related toxicities. Any patient who receives 
treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.  Each patient will be assessed every 3 weeks for the development of any toxicity according to the Time and Events table (see Section 6.0).  Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE, v  4. 
 If a patient experiences ≥2 or more AEs simultaneously that require different dose 
reductions, the lower dose should be used.  Unless otherwise noted in the following sections, a m aximum of 2 dose-level reductions for AEs are allowed on 
this protocol.  If >2 dose reductions are required, protocol therapy is to be discontinued and patient is to be followed per protocol.    
With the exception of decreased LVEF , both therapies should be reduced 
simultaneously in response to toxicities that are considered by the 
investigator to be treatment related.  Note that if dabrafenib is permanently 
discontinued, trametinib will also be permanently discontinued.  
 Unless otherwise noted in the tables below, if an AE resolves to grade 1 or baseline at the reduced dose level, and no additional toxicities are seen after 4 weeks of study treatment at the reduced dose, the dose may be increased to the previous dose level in consultation with the study PI if so noted in the tables. 
 
For AEs that require dose reductions, pleas e refer to the dose levels in the 
following tables.

A dose reduction below 75 mg BID for dabrafenib and 1 mg once daily for trametinib is not allowed. If a dose reduction below 75 mg BID for dabrafenib is required, trametinib will also be permanently discontinued.  If a dose reduction below 1.0 mg once daily for trametinib is required , then trametinib will be 
permanently discontinued, but these subjects will be allowed to continue dabrafenib. 
4.4.1 Management and Dose Modifications for Skin Toxicities 
Cutaneous AEs have been observed in subjects receiving dabrafenib, trametinib 
or both therapies in combination.  See IBs for further information.[ 4, 5] In 
addition to dose modifications detailed below, please also see section 11.5 
(Appendices) for supportive care measures for rash.    See section 6.0; 
dermatologic evaluations will take plac e at baseline, during treatment and follow -

4.4.2 Malignancies  
4.4.2.1 Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)  
Cutaneous SCC (cuSCC;  include those classified as keratoacanthoma or mixed 
keratoacanthoma subtype) have been observed in subjects treated with dabrafenib 
and the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib (see dabrafenib and trametinib combination IB) [6]. Approximately 70 % of events occurred within the first 12 
weeks of treatment with a median time to onset of 8 weeks.  These treatment -
related cu taneous SCC should be surgically removed according to institutional 
practice.  Dose modifications or interruptions of the study treatment are not required for cu taneous SCC.  Occurrence of cu taneous SCC must be reported as 
an SAE (see Section 7.3.3).   Patients should be instructed to imm ediately inform their physician if new lesions 
develop.

New primary melanomas have been reported in patients treated with dabrafenib. 
These were identified primarily within the first 5  months of therapy and did not 
require treatment  modification other than excision. Monitoring for skin lesions 
should occur as described for cuSCC.  
4.4.2.3 Non-Cutaneous Malignancies 
In vitro  experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP -kinase 
signalling in BRAF wild type cells with RAS mutation s when exposed to BRAF 
inhibitors, which may lead to increased risk of non- cutaneous malignancies in 
patients treated with dabrafenib. Cases of RAS -driven malignancies have been 
seen with BRAF inhibitors. Patients should be monitored as clinically appropri ate. 
New non -cutaneous malignancies should be reported as a SAE.  
 
4.4.2.4 Palmar -plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES; also known as Hand-
Foot- Skin- Reaction (HFSR) ) 
Episodes of HSFR have been observed in subjects receiving dabrafenib.  Guidelines for management of HFSR, and dose modifications for study treatment for HFSR potentially related to study treatment are listed in  the table below.  
Management can differ from the guidelines below based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.  The investigator should contact the overall PI  to discuss skin 
toxicity as needed.   Dermatologic exams should be performed by the Investigator as noted in the Time and Events Table, or may be referred to a dermatologist, at the discretion of the investigator.  If possible, the same physician should perform each exam for the duration of the study (i.e. if the subject is referred to a dermatologist for the screening exam, the dermatolo gist should do all follow up 
dermatologic assessments) to ensure consistency between evaluations.  
A full -body skin examination and a removal of pre- existing calluses and keratotic 
skin is recommended prior to initiation of study treatment.    
Life-style ch anges  recommended for any grade of HFSR include the following:  
• Reduce exposure of hands and feet to hot water,  
• Avoid traumatic activity including vigorous exercise especially in the first 4 weeks after start of study treatment  
• Avoid constrictive footwear  
• Avoid excessive friction on the skin, when a pplying topical treatments  
• Wear thick cotton socks and gloves, and shoes with padded insoles 
Symptomatic t reatments  suggested for any grade of HFSR include the 
following:  
• Use moisturizing creams frequently and especially on hands and feet 
• Consider topical keratolytics: urea 20-40 % cream, or salicylic acid 6%, or tazarotene 0.1% cream , or fluorouracil 5% cream 
• For erythe matous areas: clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment

information [4-6]. 
4.4.3.1 Hypertension  
Increases in blood pressure have been observed in subjects receiving trametinib. Recommendations for blood pressure monitoring and management are provided below.   
Monitoring of Hypertension  
All blood pressure assessments should be performed under t he following optimal 
conditions for the study subject: 
• has been seated with back support, ensuring that legs are uncrossed and flat on the floor 
• is relaxed comfortably for at least 5 minutes  
• restrictive clothing has been removed from  the cuff area and the right cuff size has been selected

28 • arm is supported so that the middle of the cuff is at heart level 
• remain s quiet during the measurement 
 
In subjects with an initial blood pressure reading within the hypertensive range, a 
second reading should be taken at least 1 minute later, with the 2 readings averaged to obtain a final blood pressure measurement. The averaged value should be recorded in the eCRF.  Persistent hypertension is defined  as an increase of systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) > 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mm Hg in three consecutive visits with blood pressure assessments from two readings collected as described above. Visits to monitor increased blood pr essure can be scheduled 
independently from the per-protocol visits outlined in the Time and Events Table (see section 6.1). Ideally, subsequent blood pressure assessments should be performed within one week.   Asymptomatic hypertension is defined as an increase of SBP  to >140 mm Hg 
and/or DBP >90 mm Hg in the absence of symptoms including headache, light -
headedness, vertigo, tinnitus, episodes of fainting or other symptoms indicative of hypertension that resolve after the blood pressure is controlled within the normal range.

 4.4.4 Management and Dose Modifications for Visual Changes  
Episodes of visual changes have been observed in subjects receiving dabrafenib, trametinib or the combination of both therapies. Ocular adverse events are known to be related to trametinib. The causal relationship between a change in vision and 
the study treatment should be carefully explored and an ophthalmologist should be consulted. However, if the visual changes are clearly unrelated to study treatment (e.g., allergic conjunctivitis), then monitor closely as it may be reasonable to defer ophthalmic examination. Treatment with dab rafenib has been 
associated with the development of uveitis, including iritis. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms (such as, change in vision, photophobia and eye pain) during therapy. For adverse events of uveitis, no dose modifications are required 
as long as effective local therapies can control ocular inflammation. If uveitis does not respond to local ocular therapy, interrupt dabrafenib and hold until resolution of ocular inflammation. Then restart dabrafenib reduced by one dose level.

epithelium detachments (RPED) ) or retinal vein abnormalities (e.g., RV O).  
 
Refer to section 11.1 (Appendices) for grading of visual changes.  
 If visual changes develop, an eye exam is indicated.  The exam will include best 
corrected visual acuity, tonometry, slit lamp biomicroscopic examination, visual field examination, and dilated indirect fundoscopy with special attention to retinal abnormalities.   Optical coherence tomography is strongly recommended at 
scheduled visits, and if retinal abnormalities are suspected. Other types of ancillary testing including color fundus photography and fluorescein angiography are also recommended if clinically indicated.

Episodes of diarrhea have occurred in subjects receiving dabrafenib, trametinib, 
or both therapies in combination. Other, frequent causes for diarrhea including concomitant medications (e.g., stool softeners, laxatives, antacids), infections by C. difficile  or other pathogens, partial bowel obstruction, etc., should be clinically 
excluded.   Note: loperamide should be made available prior to start of study 
treatment to patient so loperamide administration can begin at the first signs of 
diarrhea.  Guidelines regarding management and dose reduction for diarrhea

38 4.4.8 Management and Dose Modification Guidelines for Therapy -related Pyrexia  
Pyrexia is defined as ≥38.5°Celsius or 101.3°Fahrenheit.  Episodes of pyrexia 
have been observed in subjects receiving dabrafenib monotherapy and is increased in incidence and severity in subjects receiving dabrafenib in 
combination with trametinib. ( Pyrexia is also a side effect of trametinib, but  is 
less frequent than that associated with dabrafenib -see section 5.1.5). [ 6]  In a 
minority of cases the pyrexia was accompanied by symptoms such as severe chills, dehydration, hypotension, dizziness or weakness.  Pyrexia accompanied by hypotension, dehydration requiring IV fluids, or severe rigors/chills should be reported as an SAE (see section 7.3.3).   Subjects should be instructed on the importance of immediately reporting febrile episodes.  In the event of a fever, the subject should be instructed to take non- steroidal anti- pyretics  (e.g., ibuprofen), 
acetaminophen or other suitable anti- pyretic medication  as appropriate to control 
fever. The use of oral corticosteroids should be considered in those instances in 
which anti- pyretics are insufficient. In subjects experiencing pyrexia associated 
with rigors, severe chills, dehydration, hypotension, etc., renal function should be monitored carefully.  For each episode of pyrexia (defined above) , a thorough clinical examination 
(including blood pressure) for signs and symptoms of infection or hypersensitivity is required; laboratory work-up should include full blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, CRP, liver function tests, blood culture, and urine culture. For subjects experiencing pyrexia complicated by rigors, severe chills, etc., a clinical evaluation and laboratory work-up is mandatory for each event; anti- pyretic 
treatment should be started immediately at the first occurrence and prophylactic anti-pyretic treatment is recommended.  This prophylactic treatment may be 
discontinued after 3 days in the absence of pyrexia.    Oral hydration should be encouraged in subjects without evidence of dehydration.  Intravenous hydration is recommended in subjects experiencing pyrexia complicated by dehydration/hypotension.

40 4.4.9 Dose Modifications for Liver Toxicities  
Liver chemistry  stopping criteria, follow up assessments  and monitoring have 
been designed to assure subject safety and evaluate liver event etiology.   
4.4.9.1 Definition of Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria  
Trametinib and dabrafenib will be permanently discontinued when any of the 
stopping criteria (1- 5) listed below  is met.   
 
1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and  
bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT ≥3xULN and international 
normalized ratio [INR]>1.5, if INR measured.  
a. INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will 
not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants  
b. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is 
available.  If testing is unavailable,  discontinue study treatment, and 
record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick  
indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
NOTE: Any case that meets th ese criteria and is considered to be drug 
related is considered to be an SAE by GSK.  This is called “Hy’s 
Law.” If a Hy’s Law case occurs but there is a potential explanation for it other than drug, please consult with the Study PI.  
2. ALT ≥8xULN.  
3. ALT ≥5xULN  but <8 x ULN persists for ≥2 weeks. 
4. ALT ≥3xULN  if associated with the appearance or worsening of symptoms of 
hepatitis or hypersensitivity such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia. 
5. ALT ≥ 5xULN but <8 x ULN and cannot be monitored weekly for >2 weeks  
4.4.9.2 Follow- up Action if Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria  are Met:   
• Immediately discontinue subject from study treatment  
• Report the event to GSK  within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence 
(see section 7.3.3).   
• Complete the liver event  and SAE electronic case report form (eCRF ) 
within Oncore® if the event als o meets the criteria for an SAE:  
o All events of ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥  2xULN (>35% direct 
bilirubin) or ALT ≥3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured, termed 
‘Hy’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE   
o NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately 
available, study treatment should be discontinued if ALT ≥ 3xULN 
and bilirubin ≥  2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be 
performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record 
presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury  
• Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy e CRFs if these tests are 
performed

41 • Perform liver event follow up assessments (see Appendices (section 11.4) 
and monitor the subject until liver chemistries resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline values as described below  
• Follow-up  is required until the toxicity is deemed irreversible or for 3 months, whichever comes first, following permanent discontinuation from 
study treatment for liver toxicity   
• Do not re- challenge with study treatment without IRB approval (see 
appendices, sections 11.4.2 and 11.4.3. 
 
In addition, for criterion 1:  
• Make every reasonable attempt to have subjects return to a clinic within 
24 hours  for repeat liver chemistries, liver event follow up assessments 
(see appendices (section 11.4), and close monitoring 
• A specialist or hepatology consultation is recommended 
• Monitor subjects twice weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values.  
 
In addition, for subjects meeting any of the criteria 2 - 5: 
• Make every reasonable attempt to have subjects return to a clinic within 
24-72 hrs  for repeat liver chemistries and liver event follow up 
assessments ( see appendices (section 11.4)  
• Monitor subjects weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values  
• Subjects meeting criterion 5 should be monitored as frequently as possible 
4.4.9.3 Liver Chemistry Monitoring Criteria  
For subj ects with ALT ≥3xULN but <8xULN which exhibit a decrease to ALT 
≥3xULN, but <5xULN  and bilirubin <2xULN, without hepatitis symptoms or 
rash, and who can be monitored weekly for 4 weeks, the following actions should be taken:  
• Notify study PI  within 24 hours of learning of the abnormality to discuss 
subject safety  
• Continue study treatment  
• Return weekly for repeat liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) until they resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values  
• If at any time the  subject meets any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria 
1 – 5 (see section 4.4.8.1), proceed as described above in section 4.4.8.2) 
• If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xULN and bilirubin <2xULN, monitor subjects twice monthly until liver chemistries  normalize or return 
to within baseline values.

44 huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw 
palmetto, or ginseng).  
• Antiretroviral drugs.  Subjects with known HIV are ineligible for study participation.   
• Drugs that are clinically relevant strong in hibitors or inducers of CYP3A, 
CYP2 C8, p-glycoprotein (Pgp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)  
transporter because they may alter dabrafenib and/or trametinib  
concentrations.  These include but are not limited to those listed in section 11.2 (see Appendices); consider therapeutic substitutions for these medications.  This list may be modified based on emerging data.  
4.5.2 Drugs to be used with Caution 
The following medications should be used with caution as their concentrations 
may be altered by dabrafenib or trametinib or they may alter dabrafenib or trametinib co ncentrations (see section 11.2.2 in appendices): 
 
• Drugs that are mild/moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A, CYP2C8, or Pgp or BCRP transporter. 
• Drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 that are 
highly sensitive to inhibitors or that have a low therapeutic index . 
Dabrafenib has been shown to induce CYP3A4 in vivo and may induce 
CYP2B6.  Other enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and 
UGT  may also be affected. Onset of induction is likely to occur after 3 
days of repeat dosing with  dabrafenib. Transient inhibition of CYP3A4 
may be observed during the first few days of treatment. Upon 
discontinuation of dabrafenib, concentrations of these sensitive substrates may increase and subjects should be monitored for toxicity and dosage of these agents may need to be adjusted .[6] 
•  Co-administration of dabrafenib and medications that  are affected by the 
induction of these enzymes (including warfarin, hormonal contraceptives, dexamethasone, antiretroviral agents or immunosuppressants ) may result 
in loss of efficacy.  If co -administration of these medications is necessary, 
investigators should monitor subje cts for loss of efficacy or consider 
substitutions of these medication s. 
• Drugs that alter the pH of the upper GI tract (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) may alter the solubility of dabrafenib 
and reduce its bioavailability. However, no formal clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate the effect of gastric pH -altering agents on the 
systemic exposure of dabrafenib. When dabrafenib is coadministered with a proton pump inhibitor, H2-receptor antagonist or antacid, systemic exposure of dabrafenib may be decreased and the effect on its efficacy is unknown. 
4.5.3 Dabrafenib and Radiation 
Radiation skin injury has been reported with concurrent use of dabrafenib and 
radiation. To reduce this risk, it is recommended that dabrafenib be held for seven

45 days before and two days after radiation in subjects receiving dabrafenib in 
combination with trametinib.   
4.6 Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
until:  
• Disease progression * (*Some patients may remain on treatment after 
progression (at the discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still experiencing clinical benefit  
• In patients without progression, therapy may continue up to 3 years 
• Inter -current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, OR  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigato r. 
4.7 Duration of Follow Up 
Patients who come off therapy due to progression will enter the follow-up phase 
every 3 months for up to 1 year from study entry to document survival (no tumor measurement per study protocol will be necessary after progression).   
 Patients who come off therapy for reasons other than progression will enter the follow-up phase every 3 months for up to 1 year from study entry to document survival.  
If tumor assessments are available for patients who have not yet 
experienced progressive disease (PD), these evaluations will be documented in the 
eCRF until PD is confirmed. Regardless, of the reason that a patient comes off 
treatment, dermatologic exams will continue every 3 months for the first 6 months 
following discontinuation from dabrafenib, and may be done by a physician local 
to the patient. Only after these dermatologic exams are complete is the patient considered off follow-up, even if they do not require survival follow- up for this 
entire 6 month period.  Patients who come off therapy for reasons other than progression, later receive the dabrafenib/trametinib off-study and then progress on the combination therapy may be re-consented to undergo a progression biopsy. These subjects will then 
remain on study for safety monitoring, in relation to the biopsy procedure, for 30 days. Subjects who have an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) related to the 
study procedure at 30 days will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by the investigator.  
4.8 Rem oval of Patients from Protocol Therapy 
Patients will be removed from study treatment when any of the criteria listed in Section 4.6 apply.  Notify the Principal Investigator, and document the reason for 
removal from study treatment and the date the patient  was removed in the

further scheduled study assessments. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF.  Excessive patient  withdrawals  from protocol therapy or from the study can render 
the study un- interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of  patients should 
be avoided. 
4.9 Patient Replacement  
If a patient drops out of the study prior to progression, they may be replaced after consultation with the manufacturer of trametinib and dabrafenib, GSK.  We anticipat e that ≤3 patients will fall into this category. 
4.10 Study Withdrawal  
If a patient decides to withdraw  from the study (and not just from protocol 
therapy)  all efforts should be made to complete and report study assessments as 
thoroughly as possible. The investigator should contact the patient or a responsible relative by telephone or through a personal visit to establish as completely as  possible the reason for the study withdrawal. A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the  patient’s study withdrawal  should be made with an 
explanation of why the patient is  withdrawing from the study. If the reason for 
removal of a patient from the study is an  adverse event, the principal specific 
event will be recorded on the eCRF.

5.1.5 Adverse Events (AEs) Associated with Trametinib  
The data and guidance presented in this section is based on the nonclinical data 
and the safety profile seen in clinical studies involving trametinib to date, described in the trametinib  Investigator’s Brochure s.[4]   
 Based on available AE data from the clinical studies to date, the most common toxicities ≥ 20% at the 2.0 mg/day dose are rash, diarrhea, fatigue, pe ripheral 
edema, nausea, vomiting, constipation, anemia, decreased appetite, dyspnea, pruritus, and abdominal pain. Rash and diarrhea are common, class- effect 
toxicities for MEK inhibitors. In addition, visual impairment and left ventricular ejection fracti on (LVEF) reduction, although observed at lower frequencies, are 
also considered class effect toxicities as they have been observed with trametinib as well as other MEK inhibitors.  Other very common toxicities (≥10% up to 19%) 
include alopecia, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, pyrexia, hypertension, cough, 
and dry mouth; common toxicities (≥1% to <10%) include pneumonitis, dehydration, periorbital edema, blurred vision, vision impairment, left ventricular dysfunction, lymphedema, epistaxis, stomatitis, eryth ema, palmar -plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, chapped skin, skin fissures, asthenia, facial edema, mucosal inflammation, cellulitis, folliculitis, paronychia, pustular rash, increases in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and serum creatinine, and decreas ed ejection 
fraction. Uncommon toxicities include hypersensitivity (which may present with symptoms such as fever, rash, increased LFTs, and visual disturbances), chorioretinopathy, papilloedema, retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion, cardiac failure,  pneumonitis, and interstitial lung disease.  
 
The following Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions apply:  
 
Contraindications: Pregnancy:  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of GSK1120212 in pregnant 
women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity. In repeat dose studies

48 in rats given trametinib, there were ovarian effects that could likely affect female 
fertility. Therefore, the compound must not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers. Women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during therapy and for 4 months following discontinuation. If GSK1120212 is used during pregnancy, or if the subject becomes pregnant while taking GSK1120212, the subject should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus.  
 
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of GSK1120212 in pregnant 
women. Animal studies have shown embryofetal development toxicities, including teratogenic effects.  Therefore, the study drug must not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy and use effective methods of contraception during therapy and for 4 months following discontinuation. Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception. If a female patient or a female partner of a patient becomes pregnant while the patient receives trametinib, the potential hazard to the fetus should be explained to the patient and partner (as applicable). Safety and efficacy in the elderly or pediatric populations have not been investigated.  
Lactation 
It is not known whether trametinib  is excreted in human milk. Because many  
medicinal  products are excreted in human milk, a risk to the nursing infant cannot 
be excluded. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue  
Hypersensitivity  
Any known hypersensitivity to the constituents of the vehicle would 
contrain dicate trametinib use.  Hypersensitivity to trametinib was reported by one 
subject 7 days after starting trametinib who experienced fever, asthenia, visual disturbance, and symptoms suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction described by the investigator as “vascularity.” This subject also developed LFT elevations, 
lower limb nodules that by biopsy showed “dermo -hypodermatitis with 
plasmocyte and lymphocyte infiltrate.”  
 
Precautions:  
Pediatric Use  
Trametinib should not be administered to pediatric populations and should be administered to elderly populations with caution. 
 
Skin toxicities: Rash was a common toxicity in the FTIH study, and occurred at 
doses as low as 0.5 mg. At the 2.0 mg dose level in the FTIH study, 87% of the subjects experienced rash; most cases were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity; rash occurred as early as the first week of dosing, with the median onset on Day 15 of study treatment.  In clinical studies overall, rash has been observed in about 60% 
of subjects. The majority of these cases was  Grade 1 or 2 and did not require any 
dose interruptions or dose reductions.

49  
Gastrointestinal toxicities: Diarrhea was a common toxicity, and occurred 
throughout the dose range. At the 2.0 mg dose level in the FTIH study, 56% of the subjects experienced diarrhea; most events were either Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity.  
 
Visual impairment:  
Visual impairments,  including chorioretinopathy, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), 
retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) and papilledema have been 
reported with trame tinib.  
 
Subjects with a history of RVO or risk factors of RVO should not receive trametinib. Exclusion criteria based on these risk factors, comprehensive stopping criteria, dose modifications, and ocular effects management guidelines have been incorporated into this protocol.[ 4] 
 
Cardiomyopathy:  
Cardiomyopathy, defined as cardiac failure, l eft ventricular dysfunction , or 
decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  has been reported with 
trametinib as well as with other MEK inhibitors in clinical development. Subjects with a history or evidence of cardiovascular risk including current ≥ Class II congestive heart failure as defined by New York Heart Association are not being enrolled in current studies. Subjects must have a normal LVEF on screening assessment. Comprehensive stopping criteria, dose modifications, and left ventricular dysfunction management guidelines have been incorporated into this study. In addition, there have been 9 cases of sudden death or cardiac arrest reported across the trametinib program.  See the trametinib IB .[4] 
 Pneumonitis: Pneumonitis was seen in 6 out of 31 subjects (19%) treated with 
trametinib plus gemcitabine in Study ME K112111. Four of the 6 subjects were 
rechallenged with study drug, and while a relationship to trametinib could not be ruled out, all 4 subjects had no further pulmonary symptoms or evidence of pneumonitis on imaging studies. Investigators must use caution when using trametinib in combination with drugs that have been associated with or induced pneumonitis.    
Drug Interactions  
As trametinib is metabolized predominantly via deacetylation likely mediated by 
hydrolytic esterases, its pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be affected by other 
agents through metabolic interactions. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, 
trametinib is unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products via interactions with CYP enzymes or transporter s. 
 
Drug -Food Interactions  
Administration of a single dose of trametinib with a highfat, high- calorie meal 
resulted in a 70% and 10% decrease in Cmax and AUC(0- ∞), respectively

50 compared to fasted conditions. The recommendation is to administer trametinib 
on an empty stomach.  
 
Renal Impairment  
No dosage adjustment is required in subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are no data in subjects with severe renal impairment; therefore, trametinib should be used with caution in subjects with seve re renal  impairment.  
 
Hepatic Impairment  
No dosage adjustment is required in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. There 
are no clinical data in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, trametinib should be used with caution in subj ects with moderate or  
severe hepatic impairment.  
  Potential for Abuse and Dependence: Not known. 
 
Overdose:  
 In BRF113220 study, 12 subjects experienced fourteen events of trametinib  
overdose as defined by the protocol (trametinib doses > 2mg in a day). All 
overdoses lasted for one day only. Five of these subjects took 2 tablets (4mg) trametinib  and experienced 12 AEs, all within 3 days of taking the overdose. The 
adverse events were primarily  grade 1 (chills, hot flash, diarrhea, low back pain, 
changes in  hair texture, vomiting, weakness, and cough), with grade 2 pyrexia and 
chills, and grade 3 hyponatremia. One subject experienced mesenteric artery thrombosis identified as due to disease progression. No subjects required dose reduction or discontinuation. All subjects resumed trametinib treatment at the assigned dose.  In the event of a trametinib overdose, defined as administration of more than 3mg once daily (the maximum tolerated dose defined in the MEK111054 study), the investigator should contact the study PI immediately and closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities. The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.   Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the study PI  based on the clinical evaluation of 
the subject.  
 There is no specific antidote for an overdose with trametinib. In the event of a suspected overdose, it is recommended that the appropriate supportive clinical care should be instituted, as dictated by the subject’s clinical status.  Hemodia lysis 
is not expected to enhance the elimination of trametinib as it is highly bound to plasma proteins. The most likely results of acute overdose with trametinib may include rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

5.2.6 Contraindications 
Drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C8, Pgp or B CRP  
transporters, are contraindicated.  See appendices and sections 4.5 and 11.2.1.  
Any known hypersensitivity to the constituents of the vehicle would contraindicate dabrafenib use.  
5.2.7 Special Warnings and Special Precautions for Use  
Dermatological effects:  
Epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) and hyperkeratosis of the skin was seen in dogs and in rats. In clinical trials rashes have been observed, and in the monotherapy studies hyperkeratosis (29%), skin lesions including actinic keratosis  (7%) and seborrheic keratosis (7%), hand -foot skin reactions (13%), 
rash (18 %) and cutaneous SCC 
including keratoacanthomas (KA) (9%) have been 
observed. Approximately 70% of events occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment with a median time to onset of 8 weeks. More than 90% of patients who developed cutaneous SCC continued on dabrafenib treatment without dose modification. 
Most events were Grade 1 with the exception of cutaneous squamous 
cell carcinomas, which were predominantly Grade 3. Dermatological changes are

54 being monitored in subjects through interim medical history, assessment of 
adverse events and physical examination including examination of the skin. 
Guidelines on management of HFSR and skin rashes have been provided in the protocol.
  
 
Non-cutaneous secondary/recurrent malignancy  
Cases of RAS -driven malignancies have been seen with BRAF inhibitors. 
One case of RAS -mutation positive non-cutaneous malignancy (bile duct 
adenocarcinoma) has been identified to date in a subject receiving dabrafenib monotherapy. Patients should be monitored as clinically appropriate.  
Ophthalmology effects: 
Eye effects i ncluding blurred vision (2), uveitis/iritis (<1%) , eye pain (<1%), 
visual impairment (<1%)  and
 reduced visual acuity (<1%) have been infrequently 
observed in clinical studies to date, with events generally grade 1 or 2. An 
ophthalmologic consult is required for subjects developing symptoms associated with uveitis including blurry vision, eye pain or erythema.
  
 
Pyrexia: 
In clinical studies, pyrexia was one of the most frequently occurring AEs (27%), 
most of which (64%) were considered to be related to study treatment. Events were primarily Grade 1 (55%) or Grade 2 (39%) in severity. The majority of events occurred early  
during study treatment, with a median time to onset of first 
occurrence of 3 weeks, and most cases (74% of first occurrences) were of short 
duration (5 days). The majority of subjects with pyrexia were managed without dose interruption or dose reduction.  
 
Subjects should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of infection and work up 
considered as clinically indicated. Drug must be held for fever of 38.5°C or higher, and an absolute neutrophil count, serum creatinine and BUN  must be 
drawn in the setting of fever. Subjects with fever should have a medical evaluation including measurement of blood pressure. Cases of fever with rigors or fever with hypotension should be reported as SAEs (regardless of whether or not hospitalization was required); see section 7.1.4. 
 
Glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase:  
Subjects with a history of known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
deficiency may develop non-immune hemolytic anemia in response to dabrafenib 
which contains a sulfonamide, a potential risk factor for subjects with this 
deficiency (NOTE: patients with history of s ulfa allergies do not need to be 
excluded from studies incorporating dabrafenib).  
Hyperglycemia: 
Hyperglycemia requiring an increase in the dose of, or initiation of insulin or oral 
hypoglycemic agent therapy can occur with dabrafenib .  The incidence of grade 3 
hyperglycemia based on laboratory values was 6% in patients treated with 
dabrafenib  compared to 0% in the dacarbazine group in the phase 3 randomized

55 trial that compared dabrafenib to dacarbazine.  Some patients may require  more 
intensive hypoglycem ic therapy while taking dabrafenib . Monitor serum glucose 
levels as clinically appropriate during treatment with dabrafenib in  
patients with pre -existing diabetes or hyperglycemia. Advise patients to report 
symptoms of severe hyperglycemia such as excessive thirst or any increase in the 
volume or frequency of urination. 
 
Acute renal failure:  
Acute renal failure/renal failure has been rarely reported (<1%) in patients receiving dabrafenib, and a case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis has also been reported in a clinical trial. In some cases complicated pyrexia may be associated with renal insufficiency/renal failure, possibly secondary to dehydration or hypotension. Renal function should be monitored carefully, especially in patients with pyrexia. Dab rafenib should be interrupted in patients 
with significantly elevated serum creatinine (creatinine rise > 0.5 mg/dL [44 μmol/L] above baseline or creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL [177 μmol/L]).   
Pancreatitis:  
Pancreatitis (<1%) and/or increased lipase/amylase (2%) have been reported at 
low frequency with dabrafenib, typically occurring within 14 days of starting therapy. For adverse events of abdominal pain or suspected pancreatitis, amylase and lipase laborato ry samples should be monitored locally.  
 
New primary melanoma:  
New primary melanomas have been reported in patients treated with dabrafenib. 
These were identified within the first 5 months of therapy and did not require treatment  modification other than excision. Monitoring for skin lesions should 
occur as described  for cuSCC . 
 
Hypersensitivity:  
There has been a report of hypersensitivity (blisters), occurring on the same day 
as the 1st dose of study drug as well as upon rechallenge. Grade 1 AEs of bliste rs 
on limbs (4 subjects) and drug hypersensitivity (rash, 1 subject) have been reported in previous studies with dabrafenib. However, the precise etiology of these events is unclear.  
 
Drug interactions:  
Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C8 are prohibited sinc e they may 
increase or decrease d abrafenib concentrations. Mild or moderate 
inhibitor/inducers of these enzymes/transporters should be used with caution. 
Dabrafenib has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and,may induce CYP2C8, CYP2B6 , CYP2C19 and UGT. Co-administration of dabrafenib and 
medications affected by the induction of these enzymes may result  in decreased 
exposure of these medications and associated loss of efficacy. If co- administration 
of these medications is necessary, investigators should monitor subjects for loss of efficacy or consider substitutions of these medications.

56  
Drugs that affect gastric pH:  
Drugs that alter the pH of the upper GI tract (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, 
H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) may alter the solubility of dabrafenib 
and reduce its bioavailability. However, no formal clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate the effect of gastric pH -altering agents on the 
systemic exposure of dabrafenib. When dabrafenib is coadministered with a proton pump inhibitor, H2-receptor antagonist, or antacid, systemic exposure of dabrafenib may be decreased and the effect on its efficacy is unknown. 
 
Drug -food i nteractions:  
Administration of dabrafenib with a high-fat, high- calorie meal reduced the oral 
bioavailability of dabrafenib when compared to the fasted state with a decrease in Cmax and AUC of 51% and 31%, respectively, and delayed its absorption.  The recommendation is to take dabrafenib on an empty stomach.  
Pediatric population:  
Safety and efficacy in the pediatric population has not been established, therefore,  
dabrafenib should not be administered to this population. 
5.2.8 Other Considerations 
Renal impairment  
There are limited clinical data for dabrafenib in subjects with renal impairment. In 
clinical studies, 3% of subjects had baseline Grade 1 renal impairment.  
Mild or moderate renal impairment is not expected to have a clinically rel evant 
effect on dabrafenib pharmacokinetics given the low renal excretion of dabrafenib and metabolites. There are currently no data on which to base a dosing recommendation in subjects with severe renal impairment or end -stage renal 
disease.
 Dabrafenib should be administered with caution in this setting.  
 
 
Hepatic impairment  
There are limited clinical data for dabrafenib in subjects with hepatic impairment. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, dabrafenib oral clearance and thus exposure was not signif icantly different in  subjects with mild hepatic impairment 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. There are no PK data in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, the potential need 
for starting dose adjustment cannot be determined . 
In clinical studies, mild 
elevations in AST or ALT were observed in 9% and 13% of subjects, respectively, at 
baseline. Based on preclinical and in vitro studies, hepatic metabolism and biliary 
secretion are likely to be the primary route of eli mination. Dabrafenib 
concentrations may  be increased in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment. Dosage adjustment may be required, particularly in subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment .

57  
Cardiovascular effects  
Data from preclinical studies  with dabrafenib suggest the potential for 
cardiovascular effects, including cardiac valve effects in the 28 day dog study, 
coronary vascular effects in the 7 day dog study, hepatic vascular effects in a 10 day rat study, increased incidence of minimal car diomyopathy in male rats and 
mild increases in heart rate in single dose studies in dogs and rats. In addition, preliminary histological assessment of hearts from a 13 -week oral toxicity study 
in dogs with dabrafenib revealed treatment- related right atrial  wall thickening 
characterized microscopically by fibrovascular proliferation (transmural granulation tissue) associated with the right atrium/appendage.  Dabrafenib clinical protocols did not exclude subjects with risk factors for or known atherosclerotic coronary artery disease if cardiac function was stable, thus these conditions were frequently present at study entry, consistent with the expected incidence in the general population. Subjects with clinically significant baseline cardiac abnormalities wer e excluded from the studies. In the Phase III 
study BREAK -3 in which subjects with unresectable BRAFV600E mutation-
positive melanoma received either dabrafenib or dacarbazine (DTIC) chemotherapy, none of the individual cardiac AEs of potential concern including decreased LVEF, valvular abnormalities, conduction abnormailities, or myocardial effects was seen at a higher incidence relative to DTIC than  
expected, when viewed in context of the 3:1 randomization and the longer exposure of dabrafenib treated patients (4.9 vs 2.8 months). Therefore, the preclinical findings regarding potential cardiovascular AEs have not been confirmed by clinical data.   
 
Reproductive effects  
In embryofetal development studies in rats, developmental toxicities including 
reduced fetal body weight, embryo -lethality, cardiac ventricular septal defect 
malformations, delayed skeletal development and variation in thymic shape have been observed. In pregnant rats given dabrafenib, dose-dependent reductions in 
ovarian corpora lutea have been observed. Animal studies with dabrafenib have shown embryofetal developmental toxicities, including teratogenic effects. Dabrafenib must not be administrated to pregnant women or nursing mothers. Female subjects of childbearing potential are required to use effective methods of contraception from the time of a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication, until 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication.  
 In dogs and in rats, testicular degeneration/depletion has been observed in repeat dose studies (up to 13 weeks duration) with no clear evidence of recovery following off treatment periods of up to 4 weeks duration. Spermatid retention was observed in mice in a 14 day study. Male subjects enrolled or in follow-up in clinical trials are informed of the potential risk for impaired spermatogenesis, which may be irreversible. Male subjects must agree to use one of the

medication until 16 weeks after the last dose of study medication.  
 
Respiratory effects  
Lobar bronchoalveolar inflammation has been observed in dogs, with shallow and/or labored breathing noted during the treatment phase in 2 dogs given dabrafenib for 13 weeks. Respiratory changes are being monitored through medical history and physical examination. Clinical trial investigators will be requested to consider performing a lung CT scan for cases of clinically significant respiratory symptoms.  Adverse events classified as respiratory, thoracic or 
mediastinal disorders have been reported in studies of dabrafenib in subjects both with and without pulmonary metastases.The majority of these events were low grade and a consistent relationship to treatment was not observed. No pattern of specific events was observed; all adverse events in the integrated safety population (ISP) occurred at a frequency of <1% with the exceptions of cough (11%), dyspnoea (5%), oropharyngeal pain and productive cough (1% each).  
 
Overdose  
There has been a single report of dabrafenib overdose in study BRF112680 in which the patient ingested 300 mg three times daily (TID) (900 mg cumulative daily dose) instead of the intended dose of 100 mg TID (300 mg cumulative daily dose), for a period of 49 days. The patient did not experience any known adverse events related to the study medication.  There was one additional subject in BRF112680 who mistakenly took 225mg BID of dabrafenib for 11 days (22 doses) along with trametinib 2mg from study day 58 through day 68; this event was identified as an overdose by the site. On study day 58 the subject reported AEs of grade 1 blurred vision, grade 1 increase in GGT and grade 2 increase in alkaline phosphatase. The event of blurred vision did not resolve, the increased GGT and alkaline phosphatase both resolved. Only the increased GGT was considered related to study treatment. On study day 73 the subject reported AEs of Grade 1 diarrhea and Grade 1 seasonal allergies; neither  
resolved, the dia rrhea was considered related to study treatment. There were no  
vital signs, laboratory studies, or cardiac assessments obtained during the event of overdose. The subject discontinued treatment on study day 226 due to disease progression. 
 
In the event of a dabrafenib overdose, defined as administration of more than 300 mg as a single dose or 600 mg daily (the highest dose tested in clinical studies to date), the investigator should contact the overall PI of the study immediately and closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities. Hemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination  of dabrafenib as it is 
highly bound to plasma proteins. The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.

59 Decisions regarding dose int erruptions or modifications will be made by the 
investigator in consultation with the study PI  based on the clinical evaluation of 
the subject.

5.2.9 Adverse Events (AEs) Associated with Dabrafenib in Combination with 
Trametinib  
Per the dabrafenib (Tafinlar®) prescribing information January 2014, t he most 
common adverse reactions (≥20%) reported when the two therapies are used in combination are pyrexia, chills, fatigue, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, cough, headache, arthralgia, night sweats, decreased appetite,  constipation, and myalgia. Based on the safety summary in the 
June 2014 IB of the combination, of the 420 patients enrolled in MEK115306, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) when the two therapies are used in combination are pyrexia, fatigue, headach e, nausea, chills, arthralgia, diarrhea, 
rash, hypertension and vomiting. See sections 1.5 , 11.8, and the Investigator

61 Key to Time and Events Table 6.1 Footnotes  
 
1Radiological assessments, physical, dermatologic and ophthalmic exams, EKG and ECHO , as well as laboratory evaluations including 
hematology, serum chemistries, and LFTs may be performed up to 3 weeks prior to day 1 of treatment.  Screening labs performed within 48 hours 
prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 do not need to be repeated on C1D1.  
 
2Treatment cycles are defined as every  21 days ; study site visits are every other cycle after cycle 9 . The study window f or cycle 9  and beyond is 
+/-5 days. Please note: patients may remain on treatment after progression (at the discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still 
experiencing clinical benefit (see section 4.1). Patients may continue on study and receive treatment for up to 3 years or death (whichever occurs 
first) with clinic visits and tumor evaluations as noted in table.  
 
3 a Repeat ophthalmic exams annually while on treatment and if clinically -indicated due to the presence of ocular symptoms. The exams will be 
performed one year after the day 1 cycle 8 visit +/ - 2 months and every year thereafter until the patient is off treat ment. See Appendix G (section 
11.7) for Ophthalmic Exam Worksheet.   
 
4The end of treatment visit should only occur when patients permanently stop study treatment and should be performed 30 days (+/-7 days) after 
the last dose of study medication. All adverse events and concomitant medications should be followed up until the 30-day End of Treatment (EOT) 
visit.  Patients who have an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE ) at the EOT will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed 
irreversible by the investigator. See section 6.5 for follow -up schedule for patients who discontinue study treatment due to progression or for other 
reasons.  
 
5Complete histo ry at baseline only, thereafter focused history on symptoms/toxicity; physical exam to include height (baseline only), weight, and 
vital signs  
 
6Dermatologic exams will continue every 3 months for the first 6 months following discontinuation from dabrafe nib, and should include 
monitoring for cutaneous and non- cutaneous secondary/recurrent malignancies.  
 
7Serum B -HCG within 48 hours prior to first dose of study medication for WOCBP; serum B- HCG will be repeated only if clinically appropriate.  
 
8Hematology : CBC with differential, Hgb, and platelet count; Serum chemistries : creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, 
phosphorus , LDH and albumin. Liver function tests:  total bilirubin, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT). Also see sections 4.4.9.3 and 11.4 4 for 
required monitoring in event of liver toxicities, including possibility of blood draw for pharmacokinetics.  If screening evaluations of these tests are performed within 48 hours prior to Day 1 of treatment, they do not need to be repeated.

62 9Coagulation profile includes prothrombin time or INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time.  
 
10Toxicity assessment should include interrogation of the patient related to any visual changes they may be experiencing. Patients who have an 
ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) at the time of discontinuation from treatment will continue to be followed until the eve nt is resolved or 
deemed irreversible by the investigator.  
 
11Tumor imaging should remain consistent throughout study, and will include contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and 
pelvis. These tests may be performed  within 7 days prior to the study visit . At screening, a scan of the brain is required; MRI unless 
contraindicated, in which case a CT scan with contrast may be substituted. Beyond screening, a scan of the brain is not required but should be 
repeated if clinically ind icated. For patients removed from treatment for reasons other than diseas e progression, follow- up tumor assessments (if 
available) should be documented until PD is confirmed. 
 
12  The frequency of tumor assessment scans reduced to every 12 weeks for subjects responding to combination therapy after cycle 9 
AND  
For subjects responding to combination therapy for > 2 years, reduce the frequency of disease assessment scans to every 6 months.  
 
 
13At baseline, if frozen tissue is unavailable from  any site of disease, fresh tissue must be obtained . If possible, the pre-treatment biopsy should be 
performed after all other eligibility criteria are confirmed. Fr esh tissue collection of accessible tumor will be repeated at progression whether 
patient continues treatment post progression or not. If possible, biopsies at progression should be performed within 7 business days of documented 
disease progression, and  optimally within 4 hours of taking that day’s study medication. If treating physician decides to continue treatment 
because the patient exhibits continued clinical benefit from therapy (and the patient agrees) then the biopsy can be delayed until the investi gator 
deems the biopsy feasible as long as patient safety is not compromised. Post-treatment biopsies will not be required for patients removed for 
reasons other than d isease progression. See section 6. 7 and laboratory manual. Please also see the note in section 6.9.3 regarding assessment of 
biopsied lesions per RE CIST v1.1.  NOTE : For subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment, but are later placed back on the 
trametinib/dabrafenib combination therapy , a biopsy may be collected from the former study subject at the time of progression from the standard 
of care trametinib/dabrafenib therapy.   These subjects must be re-consented and placed back on study to allow for attainment of a biopsy at 
progression. These subjects will then remain on study for safety monitoring, in relation to the biopsy procedure, for 30 days. Subjects who have an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) related to the study procedure at 30 days will continue to be followed until the ev ent is resolved or deemed 
irreversible by the investigator.

should include interrogation of the patient related to any visual changes they may be experiencing.
   
Tissue acquisition: Biopsy of accessi ble tumor will be done in patients who stop 
treatment due to progression, if possible within 7 business days of documented 
disease progression, and optimally within 4 hours of taking that day’s study medication.  Post- treatment biopsies will not be require d for patients removed for 
reasons other than disease progression. See section 6. 7 and laboratory manual. 
6.6 Follow- up Assessments  
Patients who come off therapy due to progression will enter the follow-up phase every 3 months for up to 1 year from study entry to document survival (no tumor measurement per study protocol will be necessary after progression). Patients who come off therapy for reasons other than progression will enter the follow -up phase 
every 3 months for up to 1 year from study entry to document survival.  
If tumor 
assessments are available for patients  who have not yet experienced progressive 
disease (PD) , enter the follow-up tumor evaluations in the eCRF until PD is 
confirmed .  Regardless, of the reason that a patient comes off treatment, 
derm atologic exams will continue every 3 months for the first 6 months following 
discontinuation from dabrafenib, and may be done by a physician local to the patient . Only after these dermatologic exams are complete is the patient 
considered off follow-up, even if they do not require survival follow- up for this 
entire 6 month period. 
 
Patients who have an ongoing ≥Grade 2  AE or SAE at the time of discontinuation 
from treatment will continue to be followed in clinic until the event is resolved or 
deemed irreversible by the investigator.

Amendment 05                              November 22 , 201 7  
67 For subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment, but are later placed back on 
the trametinib/dabrafenib combination therapy, a biopsy may be collected from the former study subject at the time of progression from the standard of care trametinib/dabrafe nib therapy.   These subjects will then remain on study for 
safety monitoring, in relation to the biopsy procedure, for 30 days. Subjects  who 
have an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) related to the study procedure at 30 days will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by the investigator.  
6.7 Correlative Stud y Procedures  
For both those patients who do and do not co-enroll into LCCC1108, we will ask 
for a blood sample (~8mLs in a yellow -top ACD tube) to ensure sufficient 
germline DNA in the event tissue samples are insufficient.  This request and 
collection may take place at any point during the study, including during follow-up.  At baseline, if patient does not have frozen tissue available, fresh tissue must be obtained by biopsy.  B iopsy of tumor will be repeated at or after progression 
(clinical or radiological)  whether patient continues treatment post progression or 
not.  If possible, biopsies at progression should be performed within 7 business days of documented disease progression, and optimally within 4 hours of taking that day’s study medication. Please note that drug may be extended post progression (see section 4.1), and there is no need to hold drug for any length of time prior to the biopsy.  In fact, patients wi ll be requested to remain on study 
medication until the biopsy at progression is performed. If the treating physician 
decides to continue treatment at progression because the patient exhibits continued clinical benefit from therapy, the biopsy may be delayed until the investigator deems the biopsy feasible as long as patient safety is not compromised Post-treatment biopsies will not be required for patients removed for reasons other than disease progression. See laboratory manual.  
 
Note : For subjects who a re withdrawn from study treatment, but are later placed 
back on the trametinib/dabrafenib combination therapy, a biopsy may be collected from the former study subject at the time of progression from the standard of care trametinib/dabrafenib therapy.   The se subjects must be re-consented and placed 
back on study to allow for attainment of a biopsy at progression.    Biopsies may be obtained by punch biopsy , core biopsy , or surgical excision,  and 
may be performed by clinical personnel trained to do biopsies for standard of care collections.  The number of - passes made through tumor per biopsy will be 
determined by the treating physician and the physician performing the biopsy 
procedure with pr imary consideration being safety .  The tissue collected will be 
divided into aliquots (depending on size of collection, up to 4 aliquots per collection).  For patients who co-enroll into LCCC1108 for NextGen sequencing, enough tissue will be collected for both kinomining and NextGen sequencing by 
LCCC1128   CONFIDENTIAL

68 coordinating with the Study Coordinator of LCCC1108.   When insufficient tissue 
samples are available to achieve both kinomining and NextGen sequencing, priority will be given to kinomining.    Additional details r egarding processing, 
storing and handling tissue will be provided in a separate laboratory manual.     Biological samples collected for the study will be stored at the research laboratories at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC until the completion of the study.  With patient consent, any remaining tumor tissue after protocol specific studies are complete will be stored for future research concerning melanoma.  
6.7.1 Biopsy Risks 
The risks of these procedures are associated with a small risk of pain, bleeding, 
infection, and damage to adjacent organs.  The magnitude of this risk depends somewhat upon the site of the procedure.   
 
Potential risks according to site are:  
Skin/chest wall (punch biopsy or surgical excision ):  
Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, or infection  
 
 Lymph node or soft tissue (punch biopsy or surgical excision ): 
Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  Less likely: moderate or  major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, 
hospitalization due to bleeding or other complications, infection, pneumothorax, damage to adjacent organs. Additional risks may be present if intravenous conscious sedation (IVCS) is required  (see below) . 
 
Liver (core needle biopsy): 
Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, hospitalization due to bleeding or other complications, infection, bowel perforation or damage to adjacent organs Additional risks may be present if IVCS is required  (see below) . 
 
Breast (core biopsy): punch biopsy or surgical excision  
Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, hospitalization due to bleeding or other complications, infection, pneumothorax, damage to adjacent organs.  In order to minimize the risk of a biopsy, only qualified personnel will perform these procedures.  Prior to the procedure, the physician performing the procedure will discuss the risks with each study participant, answer any questions, and obtain a separate procedure consent.  For biopsies of lesions that are not superficial and clearly palpable, imaging studies such as CT or ultrasound will be 
LCCC1128   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Carrie Lee, MD MPH  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 05                              November 22 , 201 7  
69 used to guide the biopsy in order to minimize the risk of damage to adjacent 
structures.  Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, and patients with abnormal coagulation studies, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia will not undergo biopsy until and unless these resolve because o f the increased risk of potential 
complications under these circumstances.  After lymph node biopsies, patients will be observed for approximately 2 hours (range 2-4 hours) after the procedure, or per institutional standard guidelines.  After liver biopsie s, patients will be 
observed for approximately 4 hours (range 4-6 hours) after the procedure, or per institutional standard guidelines.  Less than the goal quantity of tissue is acceptable for each type of biopsy, and will be left to the clinical judgment of the physician performing the procedure.   
6.7.2 Risks of Anesthesia  
Local Anesthesia  
All biopsy procedures require local anesthesia using lidocaine or related compounds.  There is a small risk of an allergic reaction associated with these drugs.  In order to minimize the risk of local anesthesia, only qualified personnel will perform the biopsy procedure.  Patients will be queried if they have had previous allergic reactions to local anesthetics.   
 
Intravenous Conscious Sedation  (IVCS)  
Certain biopsy procedures, such as lymph node or liver biopsies, may require 
IVCS.  IVCS is a minimally depressed level of consciousness that retains the patient’s ability to maintain a patent airway independently and continuously and respond appropriately to physical stimulatio n and verbal commands.  The 
medications used to induce conscious sedation include the benzodiazepine midazolam and the opioid agonist fentanyl, as per standard of care.  IVCS is performed once over a 30 -60 minute period, and may require administration of 
multiple doses of each agent over this time- frame.  Rarely, IVCS will last longer 
than 60 minutes.    
Midazolam : 
See http://www.drugs.com/pro/midazolam-injection.html  for complete prescribing 
information on midazolam, including complete information on risks associated with its use.   
 The risks of midazolam include respiratory depression and respiratory arrest, especially when used for sedation in non- critical settings.  Respiratory arrest 
could require intubation.  In very rare cases, when this was not recognized promptly and treated effectively, death or hypoxic encephalopathy has resulted.  Other serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred after administration of midazolam, including airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, and cardiac ar rest, rarely resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury.

70 particularly in patients with hemodynamic instability.  Agitation, involuntary 
movements, hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in adults patients treated with midazolam.   
 Concomitant use of midazolam with other respiratory depressants like fentanyl may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation or apnea, and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect.    Prolonged sedation may also be seen midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs known to inhibit the P450 3A4 enzyme system such as cimetidine, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole and itraconazole.   
 Adverse effects reported after intravenous administration of a single dose when used as a sedative include the following (percentage is percentage of adult patients with adverse events): hiccoughs (3.9%), nausea (2.8%), vomiting (2.6%), coughing (1.3%), “oversedation” (1.6%), headache (1.5%), and drowsiness (1.2%).  In addition, the following local effects at the site of the injection have been reported: tenderness (5.6%), pain during injection (5.0%), redness (2.6%), induration (1.7%), and phlebitis (0.4%).   Additional rare (<1.0%) adverse events occurring when midazolam is used as a sedative include:  
Respiratory  (laryngospasm, bronchospasm, dyspnea, hyperventilation, wheezing, 
shallow respirations, airway obstruction, tachypnea ); 
Cardiovascular  (bigeminy, premature ventricular contractions, vasovagal episode, 
bradycardia, tachycardia, nodal rhythm ); 
Gastrointestinal (a cid taste, excessive salivation, retching ); 
CNS/Neuromuscular ( retrograde amnesia, euphoria, hallucination, confusion, 
argumentat iveness, nervousness, anxiety, grogginess, restlessness, emergence 
delirium or agitation, prolonged emergence from anesthesia, dreaming during emergence, sleep disturbance, insomnia, nightmares, athetoid movements, seizure- like activity, ataxia, dizziness,  dysphoria, slurred speech, dysphonia, 
paresthesia ); 
Special Senses  (blurred vision, diplopia, nystagmus, pinpoint pupils, cyclic 
movements of eyelids, visual disturbance, difficulty focusing eyes, ears blocked, loss of balance, light-headedness );

71 Fentanyl may cau se muscle rigidity, particularly involving the muscles of 
respiration.  Skeletal muscle movements in the extremities, neck and external eye 
have also been reported with fentanyl; rarely, these have been strong enough to pose patient management problems.  Fentanyl may also produce euphoria, miosis, bradycardia and bronchoconstriction, as seen with other narcotic analgesics.  The most common serious adverse reactions reported with fentanyl include respiratory depression, apnea, rigidity, and bradycardia.  If these remain untreated, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression or cardiac arrest could occur.  Other adverse reactions that have been reported are hypertension, hypotension, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, emesis, laryngospasm and diaphoresis.    The risks of IVCS  also include inhibition of the gag reflex and concomitant risk 
of aspiration and allergic reactions to the sedative or analgesic medications.  The chances of serious risks from IVCS are small but real; for example, in a prospective study of 14,149 patients undergoing IVCS during upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, the rate of immediate cardiopulmonary events was 2 in 1000.  The 30-day mortality was 1 per 2,000 cases.  In this study, there was a strong association between lack of monitoring and use of high-dose benzodiazepines with adverse outcomes.  There was also an association between the use of local anesthetic sprays to the oropharynx and the development of pneumonia.  In order to minimize the risk of IVCS , only qualified personnel (M.D. and R.N) 
will be responsible for conscious sedation.  A minimum of two individuals will be involved in the care of patients undergoing conscious sedation—the physician performing the biopsy procedure, and the individual (R.N.) who monitors the patien ts and his/her response to both the sedation and the procedure, and who is 
capable of assisting with any supportive or resuscitative measures.  The room where the procedure utilizing IVCS takes place in the interventional radiology 
suite will have adequate equipment to provide supplemental oxygen, monitor vital 
signs, and maintain an airway should this be necessary.  An emergency cart will also be immediately accessible to the room where the procedure is to take place, and emergency support services will be available on page.  Patients will be 
screened and evaluated for their fitness to undergo conscious sedation by a trained physician.  Patients with active cardiac disease are excluded from this study.  No local anesthetic spray to the oropharynx will be ne cessary, given that endoscopy 
is not a planned procedure.  Following the procedure, patients will be observed closely in the recovery room according to standard institutional guidelines.   
 
Risks of Imaging Studies 
Some biopsy procedures require imaging studies, either to plan or guide the 
procedure.  Imaging studies that may be used in obtaining tissue samples include CT scans and ultrasound.  CT scans will expose study participants to controlled amounts of radiation.  The total dose of radiation from thes e tests is not 
anticipated to cause any adverse effects.  There is also a risk of an allergic reaction to the intravenous contrast dye used during CT imaging, as well as a risk

72 of experiencing feelings of anxiety or claustrophobia while undergoing a CT scan.  
There are no anticipated risks with the use of ultrasound.  In order to minimize these risks, patients will be queried, as per standard institutional practice, regarding their history of reactions to intravenous contrast dye.  If a patient has had such  a reaction, she/he will be premedicated, or dye will 
not be used, as per standard institutional practice.  If a patient has previously experienced anxiety or claustrophobia while undergoing a CT scan, she/he will be encouraged to discuss this with her primary oncologist.  Anxiolytics may be considered by the patient’s primary oncologist as indicated. 
6.8 Assessment of Safety  
Any patient who receives  at least one dose of study medication on this protocol 
will be evaluable for toxicity, with toxicity evaluated using the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 available at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm 
6.9 Assessment of Primary Endpoint and Efficacy  
Provided suff icient tumor tissue is available pre and post treatment (specifically at 
progression) to perform kinomining, data from the patient will be utilized to inform the primary objective.  If a patient drops out of the study prior to 
progression, they may  be repl aced.  See section 4.9 for additional information. For 
subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment, but are later placed back on the trametinib/dabrafenib combination therapy , a biopsy may be collected from the 
former study subject at the time of progression from the standard of care trametinib/dabrafenib therapy.   Information from these biopsies will be included in the analysis of the primary o bjective and the correlative secondary objective.  
  Patients who have received at least 2 cycles of therapy and have their disease re-evaluated after 2 cycles will be evaluable for assessment of objective response.   Patients who drop out of the study prior to this point will not be evaluable for response unless their disease progressed prior to this point.     
6.9.1 Assessment of Disease -Tumor Measurement Based on RECIST 1.1 
See the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228-247) for additional details on RECIST1.1.  
 Measurable disease will be defined as the presence of at least one measurable lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter a minimum size of: 
• >10mm by CT sca n (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
LCCC1128   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Carrie Lee, MD MPH  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 05                              November 22 , 201 7  
73 • 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measurable).  
• 20 mm by chest x- ray. 
 
For malignant lymph nodes to be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.    All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions, will be considered non-measurable.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include leptom eningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial 
effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should 
be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended.  
6.9.2 Baseline Documentation of Target and Non- Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.   
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.

74 All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should 
be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.   
6.9.3 Evaluation of Target Lesions using RECIST 1.1 Criteria 
NOTE:  Whenever possible, a biopsied lesion should not be considered a target 
lesion for RECIST tumor assessments.  If the biopsied lesion is the only site of 
measurable disease, it may only be followed as a target lesion if a core biopsy was performed.  Lesions that have been completely removed or subjected to excisional biopsy should not be followed as target lesions.   
 
NOTE:  In addition to the information below, also see section 4.3.2 in the 
international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228-247) for 
special notes on the assessment of target lesions.  
 
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph node (LN) target or no must have decreased in short axis to <10mm. 
 
Partial response (PR) −At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD )−At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the 
target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started including baseline if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.  The appearan ce of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD. 
 
Stable disease (SD)−Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.  
6.9.4 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions using RECIST 1.1 Criteria 
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker levels.  All LN must be non -pathological in size 
(<10mm short axis).   
 
Non-complete response (non-CR)/non-progression (non-P D)−Persistence of one 
or more  non- target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 
Progressive disease (PD) −Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.

75 6.9.5 Evaluation o f Best Overall Response using RECIST 1.1 Criteria 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study 
treatment until the end of treatment.    The best overall response will be defined according to the following table.  
Over all 
Response First 
Time Point  Overall Response 
Subsequent Time

1 If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR).  Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point.  Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definition s  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study therapy.

Amendment 05                              November 22 , 201 7  
76 7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the dr ug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a  medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study t reatment, other recent 
or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: 
• Single occurr ence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
• One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events obser ved in a clinical trial that 
indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group 
7.1.3 Unexpected AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if  the specificity or severity of it is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of 
product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospitalization;*  
• Results in  congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct nor mal life functions;

Amendment 05                              November 22 , 201 7  
77 • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.   
• All ev ents of possible drug-induced liver injury with 
hyperbilirubinaemia defined as ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥  2xULN 
(>35% direct) (or ALT ≥ 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured) or 
termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to patients receiving anticoagulants).NOTE : bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing 
is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a subject meets the 
criterion of total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN, then the event is still reported as 
an SAE. If INR is obtained, include values on the SAE form. INR 
elevations >1.5 suggest severe liver inj ury. 
• Any new primary cancers and treatment emergent malignancies (including squamous cell carcinoma and new  primary melanoma) with 
the exception of basal cell carcinoma (BCC).  BCC should be reported as an AE or SAE based on the discretion of the investiga tor. 
• Symptomatic LVEF  decrease that meets stopping criteria or 
asymptomatic LVEF decrease that does not recover, as outlined as LVEF guidance ( Section 4.4.3.3) 
• Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) or retinal vein 
occlusion (RVO) 
 *Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified procedures such as administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 In addition to the above, cases of fever with rigors or fever with hypotension should be reported as SAEs (regardless of whether or not hospitalization was required).  
7.2 Document ation of non- serious AEs or SARs  
For non-serious AEs or SARs, documentation must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.

7.3 SAEs or Serious SARs  
7.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs re lated to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-in).   For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a 
serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.  
7.3.2 Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded in the SAE console 
within Oncore™ for that patient within 24 hours of learning of its occurrenc e.  
For Affiliate sites, an email must also be sent to the NCCN Study Coordinator indicating that an SAE or Serious SAR has been entered into Oncore (email contact will be provided at study start-up).  
7.3.3 Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
UNC : 
The UNC IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web -based reporting 
system within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem. Please note, these events must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence.  
Affiliate sites:   
• For affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse events per local IRB policy. 
• For affiliate sites relying on the UNC -IRB, the UNC IRB will be notified 
of all SAEs that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web -based reporting system within 7 days of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the problem. Please note, these events must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence.

79 Novartis Reporting Requirements:  
The principal investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse events to 
the FDA  (if applicable) , IRB, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and 
Epidemiolog y Department (DS&E) (For patients taking Novartis drugs) . 
All events reported to the FDA by the investigator are to be filed utilizing the Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form), if applicable 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality,  occurring 
after the patient has provided informed consent  and until at least 30 days after the 
patient has stopped study treatment must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours 
of learning of its occurrence. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the 
completed , signed form along with the Novartis provided fax cover sheet to the 
Novartis Oncology Drug Safety and Epidemiology (DS&E) department by fax (fax: 877-778-9739) within 24 hours. 
Any additional information for the SAE including complications, progression of 
the initial SAE, and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original 
episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An 
SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrela ted to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event. 
Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day safety evaluation follow -up period should 
only be reported to Novartis if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment.   
Follow- up information is submitted in the same way as the original SAE Report.  
Each re- occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be 
reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up 
information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Inve stigator’s Brochure or Package 
Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Novartis study treatment, 
an oncology Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology (DS&E) department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) wi ll be 
collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.

80 Pregnancies  
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on study 
treatment must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. 
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. 
Pregnancy should be reported by the investigator to the Novartis Oncology Drug 
Safety and Epidemiology Department (DS&E) by fax (fax: 877-778-9739) . 
Pregnancy follow -up should include an assessment of the possible relationship to 
the study treatment and any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during 
pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who 
took study treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the mother. 
 
 
 FDA Expedited Reporting requirements  for studies conducted under an IND : 
A sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and 
unexpected and related to the cellular product to the FDA. The sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the cellular product and the adverse event, such as: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with cell infusion exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with cellular product exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the cellular product (e.g. tendon rupture); 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of cellular product therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the cell infusion treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
The sponsor must submit each IND safety report on a MedWatch  form.  Each 
notification to FDA must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., “IND 
Safety Report,” and must be transmitted to the review division that has the responsibility for review of the IND. For this study, the review division is the Center for Drug  Evalu ation and Research . In each IND safety report, the sponsor 
must identify all IND safety reports previously submitted  to FDA concerning a 
similar suspected adverse reaction, and must analyze the significance of the suspected adverse reaction in light of previous, similar reports or any other relevant information.

81 FDA must be notified of potential serious risks within 15 calendar days after the 
sponsor determines the event requires reporting. FDA must be notified of unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions as soon as possible 
but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information . The sponsor must be notified of the SAE by the investigator within 24 
hours of the event. If the results of a sponsor’s investigation show that an adverse 
event not initially determined to be reportable is reportable, the sponsor must report such suspected adverse reaction in an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the determination is made.  
 
Follow-up 
The sponsor must promptly investigate all safety information it re ceives. Relevant 
follow- up  information to an IND safety report must be submitted as soon as the 
information is available and must be identified as such, i.e., “Follow -up IND Safety 
Report.” Additionally, upon request from FDA, the sponsor must submit to F DA 
any additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after receiving the request.   
Notification of Investigators 
The sponsor must notify all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing cell infusion under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.   
Process  
If the sponsor deems that an event is both a serious adverse reaction (SAR) AND unexpected, it must also (in addition to Oncore) be recorded on the MedWatch Form 3500A as per 21 CFR 312.32. Unexpected adverse events or adverse reaction refers to an event o r reaction that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator’s brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigation plan or elsewhere in the current IND application.    The MedWatch form should be submitted on MedWatch by the study coordinator.   The MedWatch 3500a form can be accessed at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm
.  
 (Please be sure and access form 3500a, and not form 3500).   The MedWatch form should also be sent to the UNC Regulatory Associate and the IND Specialist within 48 hours of the sponsor being aware of the event.  The Regulatory Associate with the aid of the IND Specialist will submit the IND Safety Report via IND serial submission to the FDA review division.

82 Additional Reporting Requirements 
The following additional items must be reported via IND safety report: 
• Findings from other studies. The sponsor must report any findings from 
epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or cli nical 
studies, whether or not conducted under an IND, and whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the cell infusion.  
• Findings from animal or in vitro testing. The sponsor must report any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the 
sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the cell infusion, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity, or reports of significant organ toxicity t or near the expected human exposure. 
• Increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions.  
 
Additional Guidance

investigators as well as study coordinators , clinical research associates, regulatory 
associat es, data manager s, biostatistician s, and any other relevant personnel the 
principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research 
team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regu latory bodies 
charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the oversight of the Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical  IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North 
Carolina TraCS Institute  Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) .   
 
The UNC LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the 
study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and complexity as determined by the UNC Protocol Review Committee .  The UNC PI will be responsible for submitting the following 
information for review: 1) safety and accrual data including the number of

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Sample Size and Data Analysis Plans 
Our sample size justification is based on the primary objective to identify kinases 
which are differentially expressed between pre ( just prior to treatment initiation ) 
and post treatment (patients who developed resistance) after treatment with 
BRAF+MEK inhibition  in melanoma patients.  
 The kinases will be profiled using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) coupled with mass spectrometry. We anticipate this technique to capture between 50 – 100 
kinases in melanoma patients. The kinase activity is reported as a quant ratio between the experimental and control samples. The Paragon algorithm[ 10] 
automatically  identifies high confidence peptides that will contribute to the 
average quant ratio of a kinase. O ur sample size justification is based on our 
ability to detect a meaningful difference in the kinase activity between pre and 
post treatment.  The inherent matching of tumor by patient source pre and post 
treatment will provide a potential source of positive correlation that may be exploited to improve statistical power (e.g., using a paired t-test).  However, in order to be conservative, we compute our statis tical power using a two -tailed 
independent Mann -Whitney test in which the kinase activity is compared in the 
two groups. Based on preliminary data, we assume that 100 kinases are captured, of which 10% of them are truly differentially expressed between pre and post treatment and a common standard deviation of 0.95 (in log
2 scale).   
 Table 1 summarizes the power to detect a true difference of D with a sample size of 20 tumors in each group (pre and post treatment) at FDR of 0.05 to account for multiple testings. For example, we achieve a power of 0.92 to detect a log
2 
difference of 1.32 (or a fold change of 2.5) for each kinase between pre and post treatment.

Data Analysi s Plans  
Exploratory tools such as heatmaps and two-way unsupervised hierarchical clustering will be utilized as visual representation of overall kinome activity. The

Amendment 05                              November 22 , 201 7  
84 univariate analysis of kinase expression will be carried out to identify 
differentially expressed kinases after FDR adjustment. Since multiple kinases 
work in concert to regulate their functions, prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) based on nearest shrunken centroid [9] will also be carried out to identify a subset of kinases that predicts resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibition. We also plan to utilize the kinome pathway as prior information in the analysis for 
identifying functionally related kinase sets to improve statistical power.  Focusing 
on kinase sets  may yield more reproducible and interpretable results.  
 Fisher’s exact test will be carried out to test for association between the mutations  
at baseline to mutations upon the development of resistance to BRAF + MEK inhibition in each oncogene/tumor suppressor gene. Tumor samples from patients  
who progress while  on study and those who are removed from study and who 
later progress on the combination treatment will be analyzed as one data set. The p-values will be adjusted via FDR to account for multiple comparisons.  
 The response rate will be estimated and 95% confidence interval will be computed. Progression- free survival will be evaluated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method.  All demographic and analytic d ata will be summarized by descriptive 
statistics.   Categorical data will be summarized using frequency tables whereas 
summary statistics such as means, medians, standard deviation and range will be provided for continuous data.   
 
9.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
9.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent

94 11.4 Appendix D Liver Events  
11.4.1 Liver Event Follow Up Assessments   
For subjects meeting  any of the liver chemistry criteria 1 – 5 listed in Section 
4.4.8, make every attempt to carry out the liver event follow up assessments  
described below:  
 
• Viral hepatitis serology including:  
o Hepatitis A IgM antibody 
o Hepatitis B surface antigen  
o Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM)  
o Hepatitis C RNA  
o Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody   
o Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, 
obtain heterophile antibody or monospot testing)   
o Hepatitis E IgM antibody.  
• Blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, obtained within 10 days  
of last dose.  Record the date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the 
date/time of the last dose of study treatment prior to blood sample draw on 
the eCRF.  If the date or time of the last dose is unclear, provide the 
subject’s best approximation.  If the date/time of the last dose cannot be 
approximated OR a PK sample cannot be collected in the time period indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample.  If a PK analysis is required 
in the event of liver toxicity, GSK should be contacted immediately and supplies and instructions for collection will be sent as soon as possible. 
• Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).  
• Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin ≥2xULN.  
• Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia.  
• Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, or hypersensitivity, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia as relevant on the AE eCRF. 
Please note that treatment with trametinib often associates with rash which is usually acneiform and affects the scalp, face, neck, chest, and upper back. Discuss with study PI  as needed.  
• Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, 
other over the counter medications, or putative hepatotoxins, on the concomitant medications report form. 
• Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake eCRF

95 • The following assessments are required for subjects with ALT ≥3xULN 
and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct) but are optional for other abnormal 
liver chemistries:  
o Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti-
liver kidney microsomal antibodies 
o Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized 
tomography) to evaluate liver disease.  
11.4.2 Drug Restart/Rechallenge Following Liver Events that are Possibly Related to Study Treatment  
Approval by Study PI for study treatment restart can be considered where: 
• The subject is receiving compelling benefit, benefit of drug res tart exceeds 
risk, and no effective alternative therapy is available.  Institutional Review Board approval of study treatment restart/rechallenge must be obtained.  
• If the restart/rechallenge is approved by the IRB, the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death.   
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the study treatment restart/rechalle nge.  Documentation of informed consent 
must be recorded in the study chart.   
• Subjects must then return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry 
tests until stable, liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then 
laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol.  
11.4.3 Drug Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Events Not Related to Study Treatment  
Approval by study PI for drug restart can be considered where: 
• Liver chemistries have a clear underlying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, 
hypotension and liver chemistries have improved to normal or are within 
1.5 x baseline and ALT <3xULN).  Institutional Review Board approval of study treatment restart/rechallenge must be obtained, as required.  
• If restart of study treatment is approved by the IRB, the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death.   
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the restart.  Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart.   
• Subjects must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemis tries have been demonstrated, and then laboratory 
monitoring may resume as per protocol. If protocol defined stopping criteria for liver chemistry elevations are met, study treatment must be stopped.

96 11.5 Appendix E Supportive Care and Preventive Measures for R ash 
 
Type of Care  Action  
Prevention/Prophylaxisa 
 • Avoid unnecessary exposure to sunlight  
• Apply broad- spectrum sunscreen (containing titanium dioxide or zinc 
oxide) with a skin protection factor (SPF) ≥15 at least twice daily.  
• Use thick, alcohol- free emoll ient cream (e.g., glycerine and 
cetomacrogol cream) on dry areas of the body at least twice daily.  
• Topical steroids and antibiotics should be applied at least twice daily 
starting on Day 1 of study treatment, to body areas such as face, chest, and upper ba ck.  
 
• Use mild -strength topical steroid  (hydrocortisone 1% cream)  
or 
• topical antibiotic (e.g., clindamycin) or oral antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline 100 mg BID, minocycline 100 mg BID)  
Symptomatic Careb  • Pruritic lesions: cool compresses and oral antihistamine therapies  
• Fissuring lesions: Monsel’s solution, silver nitrate, or zinc oxide cream 
 
• Desquamation: thick emollients and mild soap  
• Paronychia: antiseptic bath, local potent corticosteroids in addition to oral antibiotics; if no improvement, consult dermatologist or surgeon 
 
• Infected lesions: appropriate bacterial/fungal culture -driven systemic 
or topical antibiotics  
Abbreviations:  BID = twice daily; SPF = skin protection factor  
a. Rash prophylaxis  is recommended for the first 6 weeks of study treatment  
b. Subjects who develop rash/skin toxicities should be seen by a qualified physician and should receive evaluation 
for symptomatic/supportive care management

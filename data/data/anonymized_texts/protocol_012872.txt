Subject Follow -up Treated subjects will be assessed for primary safety through 30 -days post -
procedure. Primary performance will be assessed at  at least  12-months post -
procedure.  
The minimum follow -up window will be at 12- months, with a maximum follow- up 
window at 24- months.  
Primary 
Endpoint(s)  Primary Safety Endpoint: 
The composite safety endpoint includes surgical ablation procedure related to 
death, stroke (regardless of level of disability), myocardial infarction, and major 
bleeding events within 30- days of the index ablation procedure. Deaths beyond 
30-days and  through  last follow up that are attributed to surgical ablati on
pr
ocedure  or CRYOF  will also  be reported as MAEs.
The reported events will be adjudicated by an independent physician for 
severity and relatedness to device and/or procedure.  
Primary Performance Endpoint: 
The primary performance endpoint is freedom from any documented atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL), or atrial tachycardia (AT) lasting >30 seconds in duration at  the last follow- up visit in the absence of Class I or III 
AADs  (with the exception of AADs at doses not exceeding those previously 
failed ). The rhythm status used for evaluation of this endpoint will be derived 
from a 24 -hours electrocardiographic rhythm monitoring. The minimum follow -
up window is  12 months and maximum at 24 months .  
Any of the following scenarios will be captured and reported as failure of this 
effectiveness endpoint:  
•Any electrocardiographically documented AF, AFL or AT recurrences
lasting >30 seconds in duration at the last follow- up visit (by 30 second
12-lead ECG or 24 -hours continuous  ECG monitoring );
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
•The use of either new Class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs or doses
exceeding previously failed (i.e. prior to ablation) at the last follow- up
v
isit;
•Any subsequent catheter ablation or surgical ablation treatment for AF,
AFL or AT following the index surgical AF ablation procedure (except for
treatment of right  typical  atrial flutter) .
Secondary 
Endpoints Performance:  
1.Freedom from any documented AF, AFL, or AT lasting >30 seconds at th e
la
st follow- up visit regardless of Class I or III AADs.
2.Freedom from any documented AF, AFL, or AT lasting >30 seconds at th e
la
st follow- up visit in the absence of Class I or III AADs.
3.Acute procedural success defined as documentation of sinus rhythm at the
end of the procedure.
Safety:  
1.Implantation of a permanent pacemaker through last follow -up if related to
the device or surgical ablation procedure.
2.Overall device or surgical ablation procedure related SAEs through last
follow up.

1 INTRODUCTION  
This clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance with this C linical Investigational Plan 
(CIP), also referred to herein as the “Protocol” . All investigators involved in the conduct of the 
clinical investigation will be qualified by education, training, or experience to perform their tasks 
and the training will be documented appropriately.  The investigator will create and maintain 
source documents  throughout the clinical investigation and make them available as requested 
during monitoring visits or audits, as well as maintain documentation of the type and location of these source documents.  The investigator will also determine the cause and implement 
appropriate corrective and preventative actions to address any significant noncompliance.  
1.
1 Background and Rationale  
1.
1.1 Background 
Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is characterized by very fast, irregular beating of the heart's upper chambers 
(the atria). It occurs when normal sinus rhythm is disrupted by errant irregular electrical signals in 
the atria. These erratic electrical propagation patterns disrupt the regular pumping action of the 
atria, preventing complete filling of the ventricles, and causing irregular  beating of the ventricles. 
These spasms often lead to regions of static blood flow in the atria and consequently, blood clot 
formation, stroke and even death. It is estimated that AF is responsible for 15% - 25% of all 
strokes. Symptoms of AF typically in clude a rapid and irregular heartbeat, palpitations, dyspnea, 
discomfort, dizziness and fatigue.  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart arrhythmia that carries a significant mortality and morbidity risk and is associated with three primary clinical sequelae: loss of atrial transport, loss of regular cardiac chamber synchronization, rhythm & rate response, and thromboembolism. Up 
to a third of all patients with symptomatic long- standing persistent AF will experience at least one 
embolic episode during the course of their atrial fibrillation. Lone AF (e.g. no structural heart disease) with no left atrial enlargement may be categorized as a benign disease since it is not 
associated with an increase in mortality or complications than that of the general population. However, AF patients, especially those with enlarged atria or structural heart disease, are at an 
increased risk of congestive heart failure, thromboembolic events, and mortality. In fact, 
permanent AF (long- standing persistent AF after the decision not to treat) is associated with 8.2% 
annual all -cause mortality, 5.1% annual thromboembolic event rate, 2.7% annual major bleeding 
rate, and 16.6% annual heart failure rate.
ii
The underlying theory  surrounding  the source of irregular  conduction pathways  in patients  with 
atrial fibrillation involves ectopic electrical activity or micro-reentrant circuits that can originate from specific locations in the heart such as the pulmonary vein orifice in patients with lone AF 
(focal), or more commonly associated with the reentry of conduction circuits throughout the atria 
in patients with structural remodeling (wavelet AF). 
Only 12% of patients have Lone AF, leaving the remaining 88% with some form of structural heart  
disease.
iii This structural  heart  disease commonly  includes  hypertension,  coronary  artery and 
valvular heart disease. Left untreated, AF can lead to ventricular dysfunction, atrial dysfunction,  
left atrial  enlargement  thus perpetuating the structural  remodeling that causes  and worsens atrial 
fibrillation and heart  failure.iv
The relationship between progressive structural remodeling and atrial fibrillation explains why 
88% of AF patients are persistent or permanent leaving only 12% as paroxysmal.v Furthermore, 
76% of AF patients  either have enlarged atria with diameter greater than 4.5 cm or an increase 
in left ventricular thickness.vi Atrial enlargement, as well as structural remodeling, determines the 
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
incidence of atrial fibrillation and whether AF patients observe complications throughout their 
lifetime. 
Patients newly diagnosed with AF are medically managed with multiple courses of antiarrhythmic 
drugs  (AAD),  and anticoagulants  to lessen  the risk of thromboembolic  accidents. Within 5 years, 
most patients will become refractory  to AADs, and will require additional intervention.  Often  AADs  
will have the effect  of “dumbing down”  the heart’s  natural  pacemaker, necessitating the need for 
permanent rate control. Although the risk of thromboembolism is reduced in the presence of 
anticoagulation, it is still substantially higher than that observed in the general population. In 
addition, bleeding complications from anticoagulation regimens occur at a cumulative rate of 1% 
per year.  
1.1.2  Atrial Fibrillation Classification  
Atrial Fibrillation is also known to be a progressive disease which can potentially be controlled 
with medication in its most benign state but can progress to be intractable.  In an effort to bring 
uniformity to the various degrees that AF can present, the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) 2017 AF 
expert consensus statementviii has recommended the following AF classification scheme based 
upon the patterns of duration and mode of termination:  
Paroxysmal:   Recurrent AF (≥2 episodes) that terminates spontaneously wi thin seven days. 
Episodes of AF of <48 -hours duration that are terminated with electrical or pharmacologic 
cardioversion should also be classified as paroxysmal AF episodes. 
Persistent:   Continuous AF which is sustained beyond seven days. 
Longstanding Per sistent:   Continuous AF of greater than 12 -months’ duration.  
Permanent:   Patients with AF in whom a decision has been made not to pursue restoration of 
sinus rhythm by any means.vii 
This classification system has been recognized by FDA as part of their guidance documents regarding treatment of patients with AF.  
1.1.3  Atrial Fibrillation Treatment  
AF is typically first treated with drug therapy, with an approximately equal split  between  rate and 
rhythm  control  drugs  as first line of treatment.  Recent  large- scale studies have failed to show 
superiority of one treatment approach - rate or rhythm control - over another. Regardless of rate 
or rhythm control, continuous anticoagulation therapy is crucial in AF patients for stroke 
prevention. The AFFIRM study concluded that the benefit of restoring sinus rhythm in the rhythm 
control group was reversed by the toxicity of the antiarrhythmic drugs and hypothesized that if a 
treatment was available to restore sinus rhythm without the toxicity of antiarrhythmic drugs, 
survival may be improved.  
Drug therapy failure may be due to either a lack of medication efficacy and/or a patient’s inability 
to tolerate medications known to have serious and bothersome side effects, including those  
resulting from interactions  with other  drugs.  According to its package insert,  Cordarone® 
(amiodarone), the most widely prescribed anti -arrhythmic medication (not approved for the 
treatment of AF), is discontinued in 7- 18% of patients due to intolerable side effects.  
Surgical treatment of AF is usually considered when a patient is already scheduled for a concomitant cardiac procedure requiring access to the thoracic cavity. When performed 
concomitantly, the surgical treatment of AF is often performed using cardiopulmonary bypass on 
an open and arrested heart. The surgeon is unable to observe atrial function and cannot confirm  
treatment  success intraoperatively  because the atria must  be beating in order  to place a pacing 
electrode and confirm conduction block.  
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
The Maze procedures (and its derivatives, Maze III, etc.), are considered the comparative 
standard for the effective treatment of AF. The Maze III procedure requires stopping the heart and 
then surgically cutting and re- sewing the atria to create a complex pattern of lesions throughout 
the atria that are intended to block macro -reentry circuits within the atria. In the intervening years, 
the Maze III procedure has been modified, but it remains the standard for treatment of atrial 
fibrillation. However, associated procedural mortality (2 to 10%) and morbidity including permanent pacemaker requirements (~15% of patients) have hindered the adoption of “cut and 
sew” procedure.  
There have  been  many  attempts  to move  away  from the complexity  and risk of the cut and sew 
Maze III procedure. Most of the effort has focused on procedures to isolate errant conduction 
signals that are suspected to originate from the pulmonary veins either by segmental ostial ablation or by the creation of a box lesion  around the pulmonary  veins . Electrically  isolating  the 
pulmonary veins may be effective for focal AF patients who have paroxysmal AF with no structural 
heart disease. However, more complex types of AF require a more comprehensive lesion pattern  
to block  all reentrant  circuits,  and therefore sole isolation  of the pulmonary  veins is not an effective 
treatment.  
To date, a percutaneous catheter- based or minimally invasive surgical procedure that can 
effectively and safely treat symptomatic longstanding persistent Atrial Fi brillation (AF) is 
unavailable.  
The ideal  treatment  for AF would  mitigate  the detrimental  sequelae  of AF; that is, the procedure 
would  restore  normal  sinus  rhythm  and cardiac  hemodynamics,  prevent  continued remodeling and 
enlargement of the atria, and reduce the risk of thromboembolism. The ideal procedure would provide a means for assessing completeness of the lesion patterns. Continuous and complete lesions  created throughout  the atria and electrically  silencing  the posterior  left atrium as well as 
isolating the pulmonary veins are most likely to prevent propagation of electrical signals  capable 
of inducing and/or  maintaining AF and prevent  development  of new reentrant circuits or atrial 
enlargement. The ideal procedure would also be performed utilizing minimally invasive, closed chest  techniques.  
1.1.4  Cryoablation  
Cryosurgical ablation is defined as the use of a certain temperature below freezing to obtain a 
specific tissue response. The severity of the tissue response and destruction is directly related to 
the intensity of the freezing temperature. The mechanism of action of the use of freezing temperatures is that there is direct cell necrosis and vascular stasis which occurs only during the 
thawing period. The 4 stages ar e
ix
1.Acute intracellular freezing and cell necrosis.
2.Vascular stasis.
3.Dehydration in the thawing period via osmosis due to ion imbalance between intracellular
and extracellular fluid.
4.Finally, latent apoptosis which takes several days longer and can last for days.
The major advantages of cryothermy are: 1) visual confirmation of trans -murality by “ice ball” 
formation; 2) rapid creation of focal lesion; and 3) low risk of injury to adjacent tissues .x

3.2 Measures Taken to Avoid and Minimize Bias  
This is a single- arm study. All enrolled subjects w ould have had a surgical ablation with the 
CRYOF device . Study data will be monitored against relevant source documents. A n 
independent physician will adjudicate the SAEs reported in the study and rhythm assessments 
will also be a djudicated by a core lab.  Furthermore , to mitigate temporal bias, enrollment in the 
trial will be based on random selection of treated subjects . The sequence with which treated 
subject s will be invited to participate in the trial will be randomly generated  by the sponsor  and 
provided to each site.   
3.
3 Suspension or Early Termination of the Clinical Investigation  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the clinical investigation at any stage or reduce 
the follow -up period with suitable written notice to the investigator. Possible reason(s) may 
include, but are not limited to:  
•Unanticipated adverse device effect (e.g., UADE) occurs and it presents a n
unr
easonable risk to the participating subjects
•A Study Oversight Committee (e.g., National PI (s) & AtriCure Medical Advisor )
m
akes a recommendation to stop or terminate the clinical investigation .
S
hould the clinical investigation be discontinued by the Sponsor, subjects will be followed per 
routine hospital practice with device- related AEs reported to the Sponsor as per 
vigilance/commercial reporting requirements. All applicable clinical investigation documents 
shall be subject to the same retention policy as detailed in [Section 11.5 ] of the Protocol .  
A
 Principal Investigator, IRB/EC or regulatory authority may suspend or prematurely terminate 
participation in the clinical investigation at the investigational site(s) for which they are 
responsible. The investigators will follow the requirements specified in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement.  
I
f the Sponsor suspends or prematurely terminates the clinical investigation at an individual site 
in the interest of safety, the Sponsor will inform all other Principal Investigators.  
I
f suspension or premature termination occurs, the Principal Investigator or authorized designee 
will promptly inform the enrolled subjects at his/her site, if appropriate, and ret urn subject s to 
their standard medical treatment.  
4 ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Primary Safety Endpoint  
This composite safety endpoint includes surgical ablation procedure related to death, stroke 
(regardless of level of disability), myocardial infarction, and major bleeding events within 30-days of the index  ablation procedure. Deaths beyond 30- days and through last follow up that 
are attributed to surgical ablation procedure or CRYOF would be reported as M ajor Adverse 
Events (MAEs) .  
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
All MAEs will be adjudicated by an independent physician , thus maintaining the objectivity of the 
primary safety endpoint. A detailed definition of the MAEs is provided below:  
•Excessive Bleeding: is defined as a major complication if it is subsequent to a device related
or study procedur e-related injury and is treated with transfusion or results in a 20%  or greater
fall in HCT.  Transfusion  for anemia or other  pre-existing  condition that cause a fall in HCT
without  acute  bleeding will not be considered a Major  Adverse Event. Documentation of the
cause of the bleed,  and transfusion,  and/or  20% or greater  drop in  HCT.
•Myocardial  infarction (MI): When  low blood flow causes  the heart  to starve  for oxygen. Heart
muscle dies or becomes permanently  damaged. Documentation of MI; the presence  of any
one of the following  criteria:  (1) detection of ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (new
ST-T changes or new LBBB) which persist for more than 1 h r, (2) development of new
pathological Q waves on an ECG, and (3) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium
or new regional  wall motion abnormality.
•Stroke: A stroke is an interruption of the blood supply to any part of the brain. Rapid onset of
a focal or global neurological deficit with at least one of the following: change in level ofconsciousness, hemiplegia, hemiparesis, numbness or sensory loss affecting one side of the
body,  dysphasia or aphasia,  hemianopia,  amaurosis  fugax,  or other neurological signs or
symptoms consistent with  stroke. Duration of a focal or global neurological deficit ≥24 h; OR
<24 h if therapeutic intervention(s) were performed (e.g., thrombolytic therapy or intracranial
angioplasty); OR available neuroimaging documents a new hemorrhage or infarct; OR the
neurological deficit  results  in death AND no other  readily  identifiable non-stroke cause for th
e
c
linical presentation (e.g., brain tumor, trauma, infection, hypoglycemia, peripheral lesion ,
phar
macological influences). Diagnosis should be confirmed by a neurology or neurosurgical
specialist utilizing a neuroimaging  procedure (MR or CT scan or cerebral  angiography)  or
lumbar  puncture (i.e., spinal fluid analysis diagnostic of intracranial  hemorrhage).
Documentation of a stroke or CVA consisting of acute loss of neurological function caused byan ischemic event with residual symptoms at least 24 hours after onset confirmed by CT or
MRI scan or cerebral angiography of acute neurological event.
•Transient  Ischemic attacks  (TIA):  A transient  ischemic  attack  is a "mini -stroke" caused by
Temporary disturbance of blood supply to an area of the brain, which results in a sudden, brief
decrease in brain function. Clinical symptoms similar to stroke but last for less than 24 hours.
Documentation of TIA neuroimaging without tissue injury consistent with acute loss of
neurological function caused by an ischemic event with resolution of symptoms within 24 hours
after onset.
•Death: Document cause of death and include autopsy findings if autopsy  performed.
4.2 Primary Performance Endpoint  
The primary performance endpoint is defined as freedom from any documented AF, AFL, or AT 
lasting >30 seconds at the last follow- up visit in the absence of Class I or III AADs (with the 
exception of previously failed AADs at doses not exceeding those previously failed)  
The results of the 24 -Hour electrocardiographic rhythm monitoring data used for the primary 
performance endpoint, will be evaluated by an independent core lab thus maintaining objectivity 
of the primary performance endpoint.  
Subjects will be considered primary performance failures if any of the following conditions are 
observed:  
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 68

•Any electrocardiographically documented AF, AFL or AT recurrences  lasting >30
seconds in duration  at the  last follow- up visit (by 30 second 12- lead ECG or 24 -hours
continuous ECG monitoring);
•The use of either new Class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs or doses exceeding previously
failed ( i.e., prior to ablation) at  the last follow- up visit;
•Any subsequent  catheter ablation or surgical ablation treatment for AF, AFL or A T
f
ollowing the index surgical AF ablation procedure (except for treatment of right typical
atrial flutter) .

uring the discussion, the Principal Investigator or his/her authorized designee will avoid any 
improper influence on the subject and will respect subject’s legal rights. Financial incentives will 
not be given to the subject. Subjects may be compensated for time and travel directly related to 
the participation in the clinical investigation. The subject shall be provided with the Informed 
Consent form written in a language that is understandable to the subject and has been 
approved by the center’s IRB/EC. The subject shall have adequate time to review, ask 
questions, and consider participation. The Principal Investigator or his/her authorized designee will make efforts to ensure that the subject understands the information provided. If the subject 
agrees to participate, the Informed Consent form must be signed and dated by the subject and 
thereafter by the person obtaining the consent prior to any clinical investigation- specific 
procedures. The signed original will be filed in the  subject’s hospital or research charts, and a 
copy will be provided to the subject.  
Fai
lure to obtain informed consent from a subject prior to clinical investigation enrollment should 
be reported to Sponsor within 5 working days and to the reviewing center’s IRB/EC according to 
the IRB’s/ EC’s reporting requirements. 
I
f, during the clinical investigation, new information becomes available that can significantly 
affect a subject's future health and medical care, the Principal Investigator or his/her author ized 
designee (if applicable) will provide this information to the subject. If relevant, the subject will be asked to confirm their continuing informed consent in writing.

5.4 Subject Enrollment  
Subjects will be provided the IRB/EC approved ICFs  and will have the opportunity to read, 
understand, and have their questions answered prior to signing the ICFs. If the subject agrees to 
participate in the study and signs consent, the ICF process will be completed. The subject must 
sign and date the ICF prior to collection of  study data. The person reviewing the ICF with the 
subject will also sign and date the ICFs.  The subject will be given copies of the signed ICFs to 
keep.  
Upon entering subject enrollment information into Clindex, each subject will be assigned a unique 
identification (ID) number sequentially in ascending order.  All subjects who sign the ICFs will be 
documented in a Screening and Enrollment Log. For subjects who sign the ICF but are ineligible 
to participate, minimum baseline characteristics: age, gender, race, screening date and screen 
failure reason (s) will be captured in Clindex.  
A subject  is considered enrolled in the clinical investigation from the moment the subject  provides 
written informed consent and has been confirmed to meet all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria .  
5.4.1  Historically Under -Represented Demographic Subgroups 
AtriCure will take the following steps to ensure adequate representation of women and racial or 
ethnic minorities in this clinical investigation:  
•as appropriate and necessary, AtriCure will train sites on the importance of recruiting and
retaining subject s in the clinical investigation
•approach sites without bias or consideration for specific demographic subgroups
•have informed consent materials in alternative languages and will work with sites andIRBs/ECs on recruitment materials.
5.5 Subject Withdrawal  
Each enrolled subject shall remain in the clinical investigation until completion of the required follow- up period;  however, a subject’s participation in any clinical investigation is voluntary and 
the subject has the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit. Conceivable 
reasons for discontinuation may include, but not be limited to, the followi ng: 
•Subject death
•Subject voluntary withdrawal
•Subject lost -to follow- up as described below
•Subject’s follow -up is terminated due to site/study termination
The S
ponsor must be notified by the site of the reason(s) for subject discontinuation and record 
a reason for termination in the case report form (CRF). Investigators must also report this to their respective IRB/EC as defined by their institution’s procedure(s).  
Investigator Decision 
If the subject experiences an adverse event and the Principal Investigator or Medical Advisor 
believes it is in their best interest to discontinue participation in the study, they will be withdrawn 
from the study.  
Lost to follow -up 
If the subject misses their  scheduled follow- up and the attempts at contacting the subject detailed 
below are unsuccessful, then the subject is considered lost -to-follow- up. Site personnel shall 
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with the subject (and document these 
efforts in the source documents), including the following, at each contact time point:  
•A minimum of two telephone calls on different days over the specified follow -up windows
to contact the subject should be recorded in the source documentation, including date,
time and initials of site personnel trying to make contact.
•If these attempts are unsuccessful, a letter (certified if applicable) should be sent to the
subject.
Withdrawal of consent  
The subject withdraws consent for participation in the study.  Any method of contact with the subject in which they state they no longer want to participate in the study specific activities 
constitutes withdrawal of consent.  When possible, the reason for withdrawal will be documented.  
Death:  Subject expires after enrollment into the study.  
Site Termination or Study Termination  
A site or the study may be terminated. When this occurs all subjects at the site will be withdrawn 
and documented as early termination. Reasons for site or study termination may include, but are 
not limited to the following:  
•Administrative  concerns (e.g., inadequate subject enrollment, Investigator/institution non-
compliance, change of business strategy, etc.);
•Safety issues, including those due to non -compliance, which substantially affect the risk
to benefit ratio of the study subjects at a site or for the study as a whole;
•Regulatory body mandate(s).
Other (which may include)  
•Protocol deviation, noncompliance, or violation;
•Investigator/Sponsor recommendation;
Follow -up for Early Terminated Subjects  
Given the nature of the study procedures, there are situations where subjects may terminate 
from the study early that are not described above. No additional follow –up will be required or 
data recorded from subjects once withdrawn from the clinical investigation, except for the status (deceased/alive). The investigator can use existing data and ask for the subject's permission to 
collect follow- up data about his/her status/condition including information about device clinical 
performance or safety. If permission is obtained, the relevant  data shall be included in the 
clinical investigation report.  
5.6 Number of Subjects  
Up to 150  subject s will be enrolled at up to 20 sites in the US, UK and/or EU.  
5.
7 Total Expected Duration of the Clinical Investigation  
The expected duration of the study is  approximately  21 months . Enrollment will be closely 
monitored and AtriCure will work directly with the sites to clearly understand the enrollment challenges they might be facing, retrain as needed and pursue other strategies to redress any enrollment lapse. Subjects will be exited from the trial at the conclusion of their  primary 
performance  follow- up visit  occurring at least 12 -months post -procedure.

6 TREATMENT AND EVALUATION OF ENDPOINTS  
6.1 Study Eligibility  
All subjects recruited for study enrollment must meet all study enrollment criteria prior to being 
enrolled in the study. The clinical investigation site will review all subjects treated with the CRYOF 
surgical ablation system, and who are within 24 -months p ost-procedure for study eligibility. Once 
the initial chart review indicates that the subject meets the study inclusion / exclusion criteria, the subject will be approached for their interest in the study, including willingness to ret urn for their  
follow- up visit.  
6.2 Follow -up Assessments 
6.2.1  12-Month Visit ( ≥ 12-months but ≤ 24 -months post index ablation procedure) 
Subjects will be consented 12 to 24 months post procedure  and will be provided with a 24-Hour 
rhythm monitoring device at that time . The post procedure  follow- up assessment will include:   
•NYHA Classification

N
ote: If a clinical site is capable of remote subject visits, a modified visit assessment may be 
conducted. Remote subject visits should include Telemedicine appointments with the 
Investigator, where feasible, to allow direct engagement with the study subject  and to ensure 
complete data collection. Rhythm monitoring devices may be provided to the subject either 
during an in- clinic follow- up visit, or shipped to the subject for a remote follow -up visit as 
applicable.  
I
f clinical site is NOT able to perform remote subject visits, an attempt will be made to schedule 
the study subject visit as close to the visit window as is possible.  
R
egardless of when the subject  is consented, the following data will be collected by reviewing 
the subject s’ medical  records retrospectively.  For retrospective visits that fall outside of the 
required windows, please refer to sections 6.2.9 (Unscheduled Visit) and  10.6 (Protocol

6.3 Requirement for Clinical Laboratories  
An independent core laboratory will be utilized for assessment of the following data collected on 
subjects:  
•24-Hour rhythm monitoring recordings
A
ll monitoring shall be performed in accordance with the core laboratory’s recommended 
protocol.  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Safety data for the primary safety endpoint will be collected from the start of the index  ablation 
procedure to 30- days post procedure. The primary safety endpoint will be an evaluation of the 
incidence of major adverse events (MAEs) listed in section 4 .1 for the procedural to 30- day post 
procedure time period. Deaths beyond 30 -days or through last follow -up that are attributed to 
the surgical ablation procedure or CRYOF would be reported as MAEs.  
7.
1 Definition  
7.1.1  Major Adverse Event  
Events qualifying as MAEs as defined in section 4.1 include: 
•Excessive bleeding
•Myoc ardial Infarction (MI)
•Stroke, TIA
•Death
A
ny condition that was records as pre- existing is not a MAE unless there is a change in the 
nature, severity, or degree of the condition.  
Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS) and the implantation of a pacemaker for treatment of SSS post 
procedure will not be recorded as a MAE since it is a known underlying condition for subjec ts 
with long -standing persistent AF undergoing cardiac coagulation procedures.   
7.1.2  Adverse Event  
Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence or change from subject’s 
baseline (or pre- device procedure) condition, whether it is considered device related or not. An 
AE is also defined by the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) as an untoward 
medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device and whether anticipated or unanticipated.  
Adverse Event Identification: a condition that is one of the following: 
1.A unique symptom or event that is a change from the subject’s baseline status.
2.A series of symptoms or events that can be categorized as a single entity based o
n
def
initions found herein.
3.A specific diagnosis responsible for a clinical change.
4.A worsening or exacerbation of a pre- existing condition.
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
7.1.3  Serious Adverse Event  
If the AE meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  
a)Led to a death,
b)Led to a serious deterioration in health of the subject, that either resulted i n
1.L
ife-threatening illness or injury, or
2.Hospitalization (initial or prolonged) or
3.Disability or permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function
4.Congenital anomaly (physical or mental)/birth defect/fetal distress/fetal death
5.Chronic diseas e
6.M
edical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or injury or
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function
c)Other Se rious (important Medical Events).
N
ote: A planned hospitalization for pre- existing condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, 
without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be an SAE. 
Note: “Death” should not be reported as an adverse event.  The cause of death should be reported 
as an adverse event.  The only exception is “Sudden Death” when the cause is unknown.  
7.1.4  Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction  
Device Deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, 
usability, durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use error 
and inadequate labeling. This includes the failure of the device to meet its performance 
specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Note: Performance specifications include all 
claims made in the labeling of the device.  
A
 device malfunction is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise 
perform as intended. 
A
ll device deficiencies of the CRYOF  device shall be documented throughout the clinical 
investigation and managed by the sponsor in accordance with written procedures for the control of a non- conforming product. The sponsor shall take, where applicable, appropriate corrective 
and preventative actions to protect the safety of subjects, users, and other persons. Device 
deficiencies of the comparator, if applicable, shall be documented. Where applicable, the analysis 
of used or explanted investigational devices shall be included as supportive information.  
7.
2 Pre-Existing Conditions Versus Adverse Events 
A pre -existing condition is defined as a medical condition that is present before the index  ablation  
procedure and is to be reported as part of the subject’s medical history. It must be reported as a 
new AE if the intensity, frequency, or the character of the condition worsens during the study 
treatment and the AE was determined to have the relationship to the study procedures and/or 
study devices.  
To avoid confusing pre -existing conditions with AEs during data analysis, the study sites must 
make all attempts to provide start dates for all baseline medical conditions. Any pre -existing 
condition that now meets the stated criteria as an AE should be recorded on the AE CRF as an 
exacerbation of the pre -existing condition and the start date will be recorded as the time when the 
exacerbation occurred.  
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
7.3 Severity of Adverse Events  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the severity of an AE.  A change in severity may 
constitute a new reportable AE.  
The following guideline should be used to determine the severity of each adverse event:  
•MILD:   Awareness of experience, but easily tolerated. No medical intervention required
•MODERATE:  Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activities. Medical intervent ion
r
equired
•SEVERE:  Inability to carry out usual activities. Medical /surgical  intervention (including
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization) required.
7.
4 Device Relationship  
Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that an investigational product or device 
under investigation caused or contributed to an AE is to be determined by the Investigator  and 
recorded on the appropriate CRF form. Determination should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, evidence of alternative etiology, medical/biologic plausibility, and subject  
condition (pre- existing condition).  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship of an AE to the study procedure and/or device.  
Adverse events will be assigned an attribution according to the Investigator’s believed primary cause.  Events will be categorized by relationship to the investigational device(s) listed in this 
protocol or ancillary device, surgical ablation procedure, general cardiac surgical procedure or subsequent intervention, concomitant medications, pre -existing condition, intercurrent condition, 
intercurrent intervention, or unknown.    
The following guidelines should be used in determining the relationship of an adverse event to 
the study device or procedure:  
•Unknown:  A clinical event (including abnormal laboratory result) that cannot be
determined to be related or unrelated to device/procedure/drug given informati
on
pr
ovided.
•Device R elated Adverse Event :  An adverse event, that in the judgment of the
Investigator, result ed from use of the cryoICE® cryoablation system may have caused or
contributed to the AE .
•Procedure Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event which, in the judgment of the
Investigator, results as a consequence of the investigational procedure and is not
specifically related to the use of the cryoICE® cryoablation system.
•General Surgery Related Adverse Event : An adverse event which, in the judgement of
the Investigator, results as a consequence of general cardiac  surgical procedural
complications and/or subsequent interventions.
•Concomitant Medication- Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event is considered to
be concomitant medication related when, in the judgment of the Investigator, it isreasonable to believe that the event is associated with concomitant medications used in
conjunction with the investigational device and is not otherwise specific to the
investigational device (e.g. bleeding associated with anticoagulation medication).
•Intercurrent Condition: It is reasonable to believe that the event is directly associated
with an intercurrent condition/co- morbidity.
•Intercurrent Intervention: It is reasonable to believe that the event is directly associated
with an intercurrent intervention which was performed for reasons other than to address a
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
device or ablation/general cardiac surgical procedure related complication.  
7.4.1  Unanticipated (Serious Adverse) Device Effect [U(S)ADE]  
Unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE) refers to any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
7.
5 Adverse Event and Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction Reporting  
7.5.1  AE/ADE/UADE  Reporting 
General AE Reporting  
Safety surveillance and reporting starts as soon as the subject  is enrolled in the clinical 
investigation. Safety surveillance and reporting will continue until the 12 -Month follow -up visit has 
been performed, the subject is deceased, the subject concludes participation in the clinical investigation, or the subject withdraws from the clinical investigation. All adverse event data, 
including deaths and device deficiency data, will be collected throughout the time period defined 
above and will be reported to the Sponsor on a CRF. Additional information with regard to an 
adverse event should be updated within the appropriate CRF.  
E
xcept for those events listed in Section 7. 6, AEs potentially related to the study procedure or 
AtriCure devices used in the study and other AEs that the PI determines as critical to safety 
evaluation will be captured on the eCRF. Standard medical terminology should be used when 
recording AEs.  
In addition, the following information should be recorded:  
•Onset Date
•Resolution date or date of death
•Intensity of the event
•Action Taken
•Outcome of th e event
•Relationship of AE
•Indication of whether the event is serious

7.5.2  SAE/USADE Reporting  
The investigator (or designee) must report all SAE/USADEs to the Sponsor via the Adverse Event 
CRF as soon as possible but no later than outlined below.  
Clinical 
Site Reporting timelines  
All Sites  SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor no later than 10 calendar days from 
the day the site personnel became aware of the event or as per the 
investigative site’s local requirements, if the requirement is more stringent than those outlined.  
An event determined by the Investigator to be life- threatening or to have 
led to death must be reported within 24 hours.  
The dat
e the site staff became aware the event met the criteria of an SAE must be recorded in 
the eCRF and ensure relevant source documents are collected.  The Investigator will further report the SAE to the local IRB/EC according to the institution’s IRB/EC reporting requirements.  
In the event of system outages or technical difficulties, serious and any unanticipated adverse 
events may be submitted via e -mail to SAEInbox@AtriCure.com .  Upon availability of the system 
or resolution of the technical difficulties, the event will be recorded in the Adverse Event eCRF.  
The Investigator (or designee) shall send a written report including a narrative description of the serious and/or unanticipated adverse event to AtriCure or their designee within three (3) working 
days of the initial report.  The Investigator should follow all unresolved serious adverse events 
until the events are resolved, or the subject has exited the study, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  
AtriCure, Inc., or their designee, in cooperation with the Investigator, will assess all serious adverse events considered device- related for potential report- ability to the FDA as an 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) in accordance with 21 CFR Part 812.46(b).  
If a UADE determination is made, the Investigator and Sponsor will comply with UADE reporting requirements per 21 CFR Part 812.150.  The Sponsor shall report the results of such evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRBs/ECs and participating Investigators within thirty (30) working 
days after the Sponsor first receives notice of the UADE.  Thereafter the Sponsor shall submit 
such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA requests.  Similarly, the Investigator shall 
submit to t heir reviewing IRB a report of any UADE as soon as possible, but in no event later than 
ten (10) working days, (or per local IRB requirements) after the Investigator first learns of the effect.  The Investigator (or designee) shall provide documentation of  the UADE report/notification 
sent to their IRB to AtriCure (or designee). 
Note: It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to inform their IRB of other SAEs (i.e. non -
UADEs) as required by their IRB/EC procedures and in conformance with FDA requirements.  
If the subject reports any device or procedure related adverse events that are potentially serious 
during the follow -up evaluation period, the subject should return to the investigator’s facility for 
further evaluation of the event.

7.6 Expected Morbidity/Procedural Complications Reporting  
For purposes of this study, the following events  occurring within 48 hours of study procedures  are 
not considered reportable (not recorded on eCRF but recorded in source documents) as they are normally expected to occur in conjunction with surgical treatment for non -paroxysmal forms of 
atrial fibrillation procedures  (Maze III)  or are associated with customary, standard care of subjects 
undergoing cardiac surgery: 
•Chest pain without associated ECG changes
•Post-operative/post -procedure pain
•Post-anesthesia emesis, nausea, or headache (within 24 hours of procedure)
•Electrolyte imbalance without clinical sequelae following procedure, even if requiri
ng
c
orrection
•Pre - planned future surgical procedures
•Low grade temperature increase (101°F or 38.5°C)
•Dizziness: Imprecise term commonly used to describe various symptoms such as
faintness, giddiness, imbalance, lightheadedness, unsteadiness or vertigo.
•Elevated white blood count, outside the standard laboratory normal value, without signsand symptoms of infection
•Post-operative hematocrit decreases from baseline measured in the OR, prior to the first
incision, not associated with hemodynamic changes, remaining above 25% andrequiring < 2 units PRBC’s
•Minor, localized tenderness, swelling, induration, oozing, etc. at surgical site.
•Sinus bradycardia/tachycardia that does not require treatment or intervention
•Systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes that do not require treatment or intervention.

Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
•Atelectasis - collapse of lung tissue affecting part or all of one lung; the alveoli ar e
def
lated. This is not considered to be an AE unless treatment other than chest PT is
required or it prolongs hospitalization.
•Hyperglycemia - The use of insulin in the post -operative period does not constitute
hyperglycemia if during the same hospitalization. An elevated blood sugar of less than
250 mg/dl during the first 48 hours post -operative does not constitute hyperglycemia.
•Pleural effusion is not an  event unless treatment with thoracentesis or chest t ube
i
nsertion is required
•Pericardial effusion without hemodynamic compromise or treatment
•Atrial Fibrillation /Atrial Flutter/Atrial Tachycardia with or without cardioversion.
•Junctional Rhythm requiring temporary pacing
Note:  Treated s ubjects will have received general anesthesia and therefore will also be 
subject to general anesthesia- associated complications and morbidity. These are also not 
considered reportable (recorded on eCRF) adverse events.  
Note: This listing of events is intended to provide guidance to the Investigator and 
investigational site for the purpose of adverse event reporting. The Investigator should utilize 
his/her own clinical judgment in evaluating adverse experiences and may dec ide that the 
above events should be reported as adverse events  based on the IRB/EC reporting 
requirement s or the subject clinical situation. 
7.7 Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, usability safety, or performance of a device after it is release for distribution (a medical device that has been released from the organization’s 
control or related to a service that affects the performance of such medical devices). Product 
complaints may or may not be associated with an AE.   
7.7.1  Reporting Product Complaints  
All product complaints (as defined above) related to an investigational product (shall be 
documented throughout the clinical investigation and appropriately managed by the sponsor. All reported device observations, malfunctions or failures for the cryoICE ® cryoablation system are

If a Product Complaint is reported in conjunction with a SAE/UADE, reporting guidelines will be 
the same as those listed in Section 7.5.4 . 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The following section describes the statistical methods for the clinical investigation. Additional 
details on statistical analyses, including justification of clinical investigation design, sensitivity analyses, pool -ability analyses, subgroup analyses , etc., may be maintained in a separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan. 
8.
1 Analysis Populations  
Intention- to-Treat Population:  
The Intention- to-Treat (ITT) population consists of the subjects on whom the CRYOF device was 
used. This is the primary population for performance and safety endpoints.  
Protocol Population:  
The Per -Protocol (PP) study populat ion is defined by the ITT population but without any major 
protocol deviations, that is, those that could potentially bias the results. This population is defined for the primary performance endpoints.  
8.2 Statistical Analyses  
The primary goal of the study is  to demonstrate safety and performance of the CRYOF device. 
For the study to be successful, both endpoints must be statistically significant relative to their respective performance goals.  
S
tandard descriptive statistics will be used to summarize numeric variables, including the number 
of observed values, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values. 
Summaries of categorical variables will include the number and percentage of observed values, 
at each level of the categorical variable. Basel ine and demographic information, including age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, BMI, and medical history will be summarized with standard 
descriptive statistics.  
8.2.1  Primary Performance Endpoint Analysis 
The primary performance endpoint is defined as freedom from any documented AF, AFL, or AT 
lasting >30 seconds at the last follow -up visit in the absence of Class I or III AADs (with the 
exception of previously failed AADs at doses not exceeding those previously failed). The primary 
performance endpoint is further defined in section 4.2 of the protocol.  
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
Subjects meeting the primary performance  endpoint will be labeled as “responders”, and the 
proportion of responders will be compared to a performance goal (PG) of 55%.  
An exact binomial t est will be conducted at a one -sided α = 0.025 level of significance to test the 
following hypothesis that the proportion of performance successes is significantly higher than the 
PG: 
H0: p ≤ 0.55  
HA: p > 0.55  
where p is the responder rate at last follow- up visit occurring at least 12-months post -procedure.  
The ITT population will be the primary population for this analysis.  
8.2.2  Primary Safety Endpoint Analys is 
The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects free from MAEs, as described in section 
4.1 of the protocol, through 30- days post -procedure. The MAE rate will be compared against a 
PG of 1 5%. 
An exact binomial t est will be conducted at a one -sided α = 0.05 level of significance to test the 
following hypothesis that the proportion of MAEs is significantly lower than the P G: 
The hy
pothesis test for the safety endpoint is:  
H0: q ≥ 0.1 5 
HA: q < 0.15 
where q is the proportion of subjects  with MAEs through 30 -days post -procedure in the safety 
population. The ITT population will be the primary population for this analysis.  
8.2.3  Secondary Safety and Performance Endpoint Analyses  
The secondary safety  and performance  endpoints are described in section 4.3 and 4.4 of the 
protocol.  
All analyses will be conducted using appropriate statistical methods.  These will include analyses 
of the populations and subgroups as specified in this protocol and may also include additional 
endpoints, populations and/or  subgroups.  
8.3 Sample Size Calculation and Assumptions  
Performance Endpoint  
Based a PG l of 55% success and an expected success rate of 68% , a sample size of 140 subjects  
provides >88 % power using  a one- sided Exact test, with  α = 0.025 level of significance to 
demonstrate primary performance  success. Assuming an attrition rate  of 6.5% at the last follow-
up visit post-procedure, a total of 150 subjects will be enrolled.  
The lowest primary  performance endpoint that would meet  the PG is 63.6% (that is, 89 out of 140  
subjects are responders ). 
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
Safety Endpoint  
Minimal to no missing data are expected for the primary safety endpoint . Based on a PG of 15%, 
and an expected population MAE  rate of up to 8.5%, a sample size of 150 subjects will have 80% 
power using a one- sided  Exact test, with at a one -sided α = 0.05 level of significance.  
The hi
ghest primary safety endpoint that would meet  the PG would be 10 % (that is, 15 out of 150  
subjects experience at least one MAE).  
8.4 Timing of Analysis  
The primary  performance endpoint analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed 
at least their 12- months post -procedure visit . The expected duration of the study is approximately 
21 months.  
8.5 Subgroup Analysis  
No subgroup analyses are planned for this clinical investigation. However primary safety and 
performance endpoints will be summarized by sex, race and other subgroups as needed. 
8.6 Multiplicity  
No alpha multiplicity adjustments are planned for the exploratory and supporting secondary 
endpoints and analysis populations defined in the study.  
8.
7 Pooling Strategy 
For this study, data will be pooled from multiple study sites.  The justification for pooling will be 
made on a clinical basis considering three factors: (1) the study sites must implement one common protocol, (2) the Sponsor must closely monitor study site compliance with the protocol, 
and (3) the study site must use common data collection procedures. 
 
8.
8 Procedures for Accounting for Missing Data  
As applicable, several sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate the effect of the missing 
data on the primary performance and safety endpoints, including multiple imputation, last 
observation carried forw ard (LOCF) and a tipping point analysis. Details will be provided in the 
SAP prior to database lock.  
8.
9 Statistical Criteria for Termination  
There are no statistical criteria for termination of this clinical investigation.  
8.
10 Success Criteria  
For the trial to be successful, both performance and safety endpoints must be statistically 
significant relative to their respective performance goals  and that both primary safety and 
performance hypotheses are met . If both the null effectiveness hypothesis and the null safety 
hypotheses are rejected, the treatment will be considered beneficial.  
8.
11 Deviations from Statistical Plan  
Any major changes to the statistical plan will be documented in an amendment to the statistical 
plan. Less significant changes to  the planned analyses will be documented in the final report.

APPENDIX III: DEFINITIONS  
BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS  
S
evere a nemia: Hematocrit below 25%.  Generally , an accepted value to consider the need for 
transfusion of red blood cells.  This is not in the setting of acute persistent bleeding. 
C
oagulopathy: Bleeding in the presence with abnormal clotting studies.  
H
emodilutional Anemia : Anemia associated with fluid volume overload as a result of 
cardiopulmonary bypass.  
H
IT (Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia): Low blood platelet count as a result of the 
medication heparin. Must have lab evidence of HIT +.  
Leukopeni
a: Leukopenia is defined as leukocyte count of < 3.5 x109/liter for more than 3 days.  
N
eutropenia: Neutropenia is defined as ANC <1000 per mm3 for more than 3 days.  
T
hrombocytopenia: A persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets. This is not 
considered to be an AE until treated.  
CARDIAC DISORDERS   
Arrhythmias (other than Atrial Fibrillation / Atrial Flutter or Atrial Tachycardia)  
Bradycardia : Abnormally low heart rate (<60 bpm) requiring treatment (implantation of a 
temporary or permanent pacemaker, or medication).  
SVT
: Tachycardia in which QRS is narrow and P waves are present and associated. In certain 
SVT’s the QRS may be wide (>120msec) when it is aberrant and in some the P wave may be 
invisible as it maybe superimposed on the QRS (AV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia).  
V
entricular tachycardia (VT) : A regular heart rhythm originating from the ventricle with a  heart 
rate of greater than 100 bpm for at least 30 seconds or requiring termination due to hemodynamic compromise.     
Ventricular fibril lation (VF): A rapid irregular ventricular rhythm due to multiple reentrant 
activities associated with essentially zero ca rdiac output.  
A
trioventricular (AV) Block:  
•2nd degree: Second- degree (AV) block is characterized by interruption of impulse
conduction through the AV node. This may take the form of progressive prolongation of
the P -R interval until there is a non -conducted beat with no QRS (Mobitz I or Wenckebach)
or intermittent non- conducted P waves without preceding prolongation of the P -R interval
or subsequent shortening of the interval (Mobitz II). This excludes block due to prematur e
at
rial beats
•3rd degree: Third -degree AV block (complete heart block) exists when more P waves than
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
the QRS complexes exist  and no relationship exists between them (no conduction).  
A
ngina : A tight or heavy feeling in the chest, discomfort which spreads from the chest to the arm, 
back, neck, jaw, or stomach, numbness or tingling in the shoulders, arms or wrists, shortness of 
breath, and nausea.  
A
trial thrombus: Thrombus formation or detection within the atrium.  
C
ardiac Arrest: Absent or inadequate contraction of the left ventricle of the heart that immediately 
causes body wide circulatory failure.  
C
ardiac Tamponade: See Cardiac Tamponade/Perforation definition.  
C
ardiac Tamponade /Perforation : Cardiac tamponade/perforation is defined as a complication 
of AF ablation if the development of a significant pericardial effusion occurs during or within 30 
days of undergoing an AF Ablation procedure. A significant pericardial effusion is one which results in hemodynamic compromise, requires elective or urgent pericardiocentesis, or results in 
a pericardial effusion of 1 cm or more (by echocardiography). Cardiac tamponade/perforation 
should be classified as “early” or “late” depending on whether it is diagnosed during or following 
initial discharge from the hospital.  
C
ardiogenic Shock: Subject exhibits cardiogenic shock (s ystolic pressure < 80mm Hg and 
PCWP > 20mm Hg or cardiac index <1 .8 liters/minute/m2 or intra -aortic balloon pump or 
intravenous inotropes are needed to maintain a systolic pressure>80 mm Hg) for any time within 24 hours prior to index procedure. 
C
ongestive Heart Failure: Documentation of one of the following:  
•Paroxysm al nocturnal dyspnea (PND)
•Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) due to heart failure
•Elevated PCW with associated SOB or x -ray consistent with congestion.
•May be related to fluid overload in the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease.
H
eart Failure: A clinical syndrome resulting from a cardiac disease which comprises ventricular 
systolic or diastolic function or both. Heart failure results when the heart is unable to generate a cardiac output sufficient to meet the demands of the body without unduly increasing diastolic 
pressure. Heart failure may be manifested by symptoms of poor tissue perfusion alone (i.e., 
fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, confusion) or by both symptoms of poor tissue perfusion and congestion of vascular beds (e.g., dyspnea, chest rales, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, 
distended neck veins, congested liver, peripheral edema). We will not distinguish between 
congestive and chronic heart failure for purposes of this protocol.  
M
yocardial Infarction in the context of surgical AF Ablation: The presence of any one of the 
following criteria:  
1.Detection of ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (new ST- T changes), which may
persist for more than one hour;
2.Development of new pathological Q waves on an ECG;
3.Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall abnormality.
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
M
yocardial Perforation: See Cardiac Tamponade/Perforation definition. 
P
ericardial effusion: Fluid detected in the pericardial space by standard imaging techniques 
(e.g., ec hocardiography).  
P
ericarditis: Irritation or inflammation of the pericardium associated with pain on inspiration and 
shortness of breath. Clinical signs may include shallow respiration, pericardial friction rub and 
ECG changes (ST elevation across the precordial leads). 
S
ick sinus syndrome : also called sinus node dysfunction, is a group of abnormal heart rhythms 
(arrhythmia) presumably caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker.  
U
nstable Angina : Angina which increases in frequency, intensity, or duration, which occurs at 
rest, or which is new in onset. Unstable angina is a syndrome that is intermediate between stable angina and myocardial infarction: it is characterized by an accelerating or "crescendo" pattern of chest pain that lasts longer than instable angina, occurs at rest or with less exertion than instable angina, or is less responsive to medication.  Unstable angina and myocardial infarction are 
considered acute coronary syndromes.  
GASTROINTESTINAL/GENITOURINARY DEFI NITIONS  
A
trioesophageal Fistula: A connection between the atrium and the lumen of the esophagus. 
Evidence supporting this diagnosis includes documentation of esophageal erosion combined with 
evidence of a fistulous connection to the atrium such as an air embolus, an embolic event, or direct observation at the time of surgical repair.  A CT scan or MRI scan are the most common 
methods of documentation of an atrial esophageal fistula.  Esophagoscopy should NOT be 
performed as it may result in air insufflation into the left Atrium.  
A
ortoesophageal Fistula: Abnormal passage from aorta communicating with the esophagus (for 
the purposes of the protocol - likely resulting from an esophageal perforation or burn). 
Presentation of aortoesophageal fistula may include hematemesis (possibly massive). Diagnosis may be obtained with a contrast CT scan, aortography, esophagoscopy, or barium swallow.  A possible outcome of aortoesophageal fistula is sepsis, which may be diagnosed with blood 
cultures.  
E
sophageal Dyskinesia: diffuse spasms of the esophagus which may occur as the result of 
vagal nerve injury  
Esophageal Injury: Any evidence of a mild complication such as erosion or ulceration or a major 
complication such as puncture, dissection, or perforation to the esophagus.   
Hernia: an anatomical part (such as section of the intestine) protrudes through an opening, tear, 
or weakness in the abdominal wall musculature.  
Protocol Number: CP -2021- 02 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 68 
Protocol Name: FREEZE- AFIB Study Form -582.A  
Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
Gastric Motility Disorders: multiple gastric disorders may occur post AF ablation such as 
constipation, atony, weight loss, early satiety, diarrhea or GI disturbance.  
Gastroparesis:  delayed gastric emptying resulting in paresis of the stomach.  As the vagus nerve 
controls the cont ractions of the stomach, this may occur when the vagus nerve is damaged and 
the muscles of the stomach and intestines do not work normally.  
Renal Complications:  
•Renal Failure: Inability of the kidneys to filter toxins resulting in a serum creatinine
incre ase to > 2.0 mg/dl and one of the following:
oincrease of 2.0 mg/dl in serum creatinine over any previous value
o50% or greater increase in creatinine over baseline procedural value
requirement for dialysis  
•Renal failure that requires dialysis: a significant  decrease in renal function requiri ng
d
ialysis.
•Renal Insufficiency: An  increase in serum creatinine of ≥1.0 mg/dl over previous value.

disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder or depression.  
RESPIRATORY/PULMONARY  
A
cute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): A failure of the respiratory system characterized 
by fluid accumulation within the lung that causes the lung to stiffen. This condition must be confirmed by radiological evidence, or lung biopsy, or the need for prolonged positive pressure ventilation.  
A
telectasis: (post -surgical) is a collapse of lung tissue affecting part or all of one lung; the alveoli 
are deflated. This is an AE when treatment other than Chest PT is required or it prolongs hospitalization.  
D
iaphragmatic paralysis: may be unilateral or bilateral.  Usually caused by injury to the phrenic 
nerve as a result of trauma to the thoracic cage. Findings include decreased air flow, dullness to percussion, and absence of diaphragmatic excursion on the ipsilateral side. Diagnosi s may be

Version: Rev A ; August 2, 2021
made with fluoroscopy in which a quick “sniff” (i.e. subject inspiration) results in observation of 
paradoxical elevation of the ipsilateral diaphragm.  Often causes shortness of breath on activity.  
H
emoptysis: A cough that produces bloody sputum . 
Pleural Effusion: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space evidenced by x -ray, 
echocardiography, CT Scan or other appropriate diagnostic technique and which requires drainage.  
P
neumothorax: Air in the thoracic cavity associated with partial collapse of a lung with chest tube 
drainage required.  
P
ulmonary Edema: Pulmonary edema is present if there is fluid accumulation in the lungs 
caused by backpressure in the lung veins. This condition must be confirmed by radiological evidence or lung water measurem ents.  
P

or spiral CT or clinical symptoms consistent with PE in the absence of these studies that result in treatment.  
P
ulmonary Hypertension: Subject has mean pulmonary artery pressure that is greater than 25 
mmHg at rest and/or greater than 30 mmHg during exercise as measured by right heart catheterization.  
P
ulmonary vein stenosis: Defined as 70% diameter stenosis of one pulmonary vein or 50% 
diameter stenosis of more than one vessel. PV stenosis is manifest as dyspnea at rest, may be 
associated with hemoptysis and must be confirmed by imaging studies of the pulmonary veins (using CT or MRI).  
R
espiratory failure: Need for mechanical ventilation beyond 48 hours of completion of surgical 
procedure(s), or the need for re- intubation and ventilator support occurring at any time within 30 
days of the surgical procedure, outside the setting of an additional operation.  
R

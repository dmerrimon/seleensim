Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Background, Rationale and Goals
1. * Describe the study's background and what is currently known from the scientific literature, including
citations, or upload a citation list in document upload.  Use lay language whenever possible.
Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) who graduate from high school seeking employment face significant
challenges compared with those with other disabilities. Shattuck et al. (2011) noted that nearly 80% still live at home,
almost half have no job or post-secondary training, 40% do not have contact with friends, 17% do not feel hopeful
about their future, 21% do not engage in outside activities, and many experience a decrease in insurance coverage
and access to therapy services. Additionally, individuals with ASD in adolescence and early adulthood have a higher
incidence of anxiety disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder, and depression than their peers without
disabilities or other disabilities (Gotham, Brunwasser, & Lord, 2015). The lack of access to services and poor outcomes
along with an apparent fragile mental health frequently may lead to social isolation, increasing the fragility of the
individual (Bishop-Fitzpatrick, Mazefsky, Minshew, & Eack, 2015; Swain, Scarpa, White, & Laugeson, 2015). Thus,
transition service providers, including educational and vocational rehabilitation service providers are struggling to meet
their responsibility to prepare students with ASD for productive and independent lives after high school. At the same
time, however, the blame for this condition does not rest entirely with teachers, job coaches, and vocational
rehabilitation case managers. The research community bears significant responsibility for this dilemma by failing to
include transition-aged high school students with ASD in meaningful research to determine practices that will reverse
this trend. Military dependents with ASD in the 18-22 year old (transition) age ranges are further disadvantaged by a
total lack of clinical research addressing their unique needs. Thus the proposed study fills an important clinical practice
and research gap. Specifically, the proposed project will study the impact of a transition to employment model, Project
SEARCH plus ASD Supports (PS+ASD), which has evidence of efficacy for increasing employment outcomes and
independence in 18-22 year olds with ASD. The proposed project will extend previous work by exploring the impact of
PS+ASD for military dependents with ASD while also measuring the impact of the intervention on social
responsiveness, mental health, and quality of life.
In this project, we target 18-22 year old military dependents with ASD in their final year of high school as they transition
to employment. The United States General Accountability Office noted that improved transition practices and outcomes
for youth with disabilities is a major need (United States Government Accountability Office, July 2012). Young people
with ASD present unique challenges related to post school employment outcomes. Community based employment
rates for individuals with ASD, regardless of intellectual ability, reportedly range between 4.1 to 11.8% (Taylor & Seltzer,
2011). Across the ability spectrum, individuals with ASD have lower rates of participation in vocational or technical
education, employment, and post-secondary education in 2 or 4-year programs than their peers with speech language
impairments, learning disabilities or intellectual disabilities for as long as 7 years post high school. (Schall, Targett, &
Wehman, 2013; Shattuck et al., 2012).
Additionally, adolescents and young adults with ASD largely have been orphaned from the research literature
addressing transition from high school to employment. A review of the extant literature on interventions for individuals
with ASD reveals a paucity of research regarding transition packages and models that would change this pattern of
significant underperformance in the transition to adulthood and incorporate autism specific interventions (e.g., Schall,
Carr, Targett, West, & Cifu, 2014; Schall, Targett, & Wehman, 2013; Shattuck, et al., 2012). Most of the existing
literature has described the characteristics of transition-aged young adult population of individuals with ASD, the
services or lack thereof that young adults with ASD access or the poor outcomes achieved by this group of individuals
(e.g., Barker, et al., 2011; Cimera & Cowan, 2009; Henninger & Taylor, 2012; Schall & McDonough, 2010; Shattuck, et
al., 2010; Shattuck, et al., 2012; Smith, Fleming, Wright, Losh, Humm, Olsen, & Bell, 2015). The findings from this
literature indicate that, despite a slight lessening of the original symptoms, individuals with ASD continue to have
significant challenges in all environments related to social interaction, communication, and independence into
adolescence and adulthood.
Military dependents with ASD who are transitioning from school to employment experience greater disadvantages than
their non-military peers with ASD. For example, relocation and deployment in service to our nation may unwittingly
trigger many of the conditions associated with poor transition outcomes for youth with ASD. Specifically, life in the
military may lead to increased stress, lower social skills, and increased maladaptive behavior for the individual with
ASD. Additionally, due to frequent moves, the family may lack access to local resources to support the individual with
ASD (Lincoln & Sweeten, 2011). Finally, there have been no research intervention studies to explore treatment models
targeted to transition aged military dependents with ASD.
By subjecting PS+ASD to the rigor of a clinical trial with military dependents with ASD, we expect to expand the model
to include essential elements to meet the needs of this population of individuals who may be dually disadvantaged by
their disability and their status as military dependents. Such information may lead to the development of improved
outcomes for these individuals and reduce stress for their families.
2. * Describe the study hypothesis and/or research questions.  Use lay language whenever possible.
There are three primary and three secondary endpoints under investigation in this study: (1) Employment status, (2)
wage, (3) number of hours worked per week at 12 and 18-months post enrollment. In addition, the effect of the
intervention on (5) social communication, (6) mental health, and (7) quality of life will be explored. Specifically, our
hypotheses are:
Hypothesis 1: Young adults who participate in an employer-based employment training and placement program will
demonstrate a higher rate of employment than those in the control condition.
Hypothesis 2: Young adults who participate in a work-based employment training and placement program will earn
higher wages on average compared to those in the control condition.
Hypothesis 3: Young adults who participate in a work-based employment training and placement program will work
more hours per week on average than those in the control condition.
Hypothesis 4: Young adults who participate in a work-based employment training and placement program will increase
their social responsiveness skills compared to those in the control condition, as measured by the Social Responsive
Scale, 2nd Ed.
Hypothesis 5: Young adults who participate in a work based employment training and placement program will display
lower anxiety and depression scores than those in the control condition as measured by the Behavior Assessment
System for Children, 3rd Ed. Teacher Rating Scales – Adolescent version.
Hypothesis 6: Young adults who participate in a work based employment training and placement program will report
higher quality of life scores than those in the control condition as measured by the Quality of Life Questionnaire.
3. * Describe the study's specific aims or goals.  Use lay language whenever possible.
The objective of this proposed project is to study the impact of Project SEARCH plus Autism Spectrum Disorders
Supports (PS+ASD) on the social communication, behavioral, and employment outcomes of military dependents with
ASD using a randomized clinical trial with a wait-list control group. We propose to implement an efficacious
intervention, PS+ASD, for 18 – 22 year old military dependents with ASD, to measure the effect of this intervention on
community-based competitive employment, social communication, mental health, and quality of life. The primary
objective of this research is to determine if subjects who receive PS+ASD have greater improvement in three
vocational domains (employment status, wage, number of hours worked per week) than subjects in a wait-list control
group at 12 and 18 -months post-enrollment.
Secondary Objectives. To assess differences in three personal domains (social communication, mental health, and
quality of life) for the treatment and wait-list control groups at baseline, 12 and 18-months post enrollment.
Exploratory Objectives. Exploratory objectives are to compare the three vocational domains and three personal
domains at baseline, 12 and 18-months post enrollment in subjects receiving the treatment compared to those in the
wait-list control group.
Aims. The aims of this project are to (1) Modify PS+ASD Model for Military Dependents, (2) implement the intervention
based upon the PS+ASD manual with the addition of the modified elements and will measure fidelity of
implementation, (3) measure the impact of the intervention on the employment outcomes social communication, mental
health and quality of life of the military dependents who participate compared to an equal control group who do not
receive the intervention.
4. * Describe the scientific benefit or importance of the knowledge to be gained:
Equally important, the successful conclusion of this research project will provide empirical validation of the most
effective procedures for utilizing community-based instruction for youth with autism. Additionally, we expect to show the
positive relationship between community experiences and competitive employment that occurs when a student's
support needs and interests are identified prior to job placement. With the growing incidence of autism spectrum
disorders, there is a corresponding need for instructional models that result in greater levels of financial independence,
vocational competency, and long-term engagement in the workforce with supports. This project will contribute to the
development of one such model. The single subject design used in this study provides preliminary evidence regarding
the efficacy of the model that can be empirically validated with larger-scale replications. We feel that potential benefits
far outweigh the minimal risk involved.
5. * Describe any potential for direct benefits to participants in this study:
We anticipate numerous positive outcomes from this project. At a minimum, 38 youth with autism will engage in
community-based work experiences that lead to a competitive employment job while transitioning from school to
adulthood. There is no guarantee of direct benefit to all individual participants.
The control group participants will benefit from participation in the assessments during the research. By completing the
Supports Intensity Scale, they will gain a better understanding of their skill development needs with respect to future
employment.
6. * Describe any potential for direct social impact in this study . For example, any engagement with specific
communities to respond to community-identified needs, or ways the study will strengthen the well-being of
the specific communities if applicable:
This study resulted in a significantly higher percentage of participants in the PS+ASD condition acquiring employment
while participants who were initially assigned to the waitlist condition were unlikely to acquire employment. Further, the
acquisition of employment was demonstrated to result in higher rates of independence and quality of life outcomes for
participants who gained employment. This represents both an important research outcome and a critical outcome for
military dependent and connected youth. This is also an important study for military families as they navigate the
complexities of military life (frequent moves, wait lists for services, etc.) and supporting a youth with autism.

Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Study Population
1. * Provide the maximum number of individuals that
  1. May participate in any study interaction or intervention (Including screening, consenting, and study
activities)
      AND/OR
  2. You obtain any data/specimens about (regardless of identifiability) 
 at VCU and at other sites under the VCU IRB's oversight. See the help text for additional guidance.
96 
2. If this is a multi-Center Project, what is the maximum anticipated number of subjects across all sites?
This is not a multi Center project.
3. * Provide justification for the sample size by explaining how you arrived at the expected number of
participants and why this number is adequate for answering the research questions:
The purpose of the statistical power analysis is to determine the sample size needed to credibly detect the treatment
effects on the transition outcomes described above. For planning adequately powered experiments, the power
analysis, using PASS (Hintze, 2011) was used with the six outcome variables including the primary outcome measure,
employment rate, to determine the estimated level of power for any given sample size in this RCT efficacy study. To be
conservative, a two-sided test is carried out (larger sample size required) in the power analysis.
Based on available data and past testimonies, the employment rate of students who received Project SEARCH
program varies from 60% to 90% across different states and sites. Our pilot study of students with ASD in the Virginia
site (Wehman, Schall, et al., in review) indicates that the employment rate upon completion of students with ASD in the
intervention group is higher than those with ASD in the control group with 87% vs. 6.7% employed at completion. Given
the sample size designated in this study, with 16 in the treatment group and 22 in the wait-list control group, the study
will have greater than .80 power to detect a significant difference (at the two sided 5% level) between treatment and
control groups when using Fischer’s Exact Test. For the six continuous outcome variables (i.e., hourly wages,
hours/week, Social Responsiveness Scale total score, Behavior Assessment System for Children t-score, and Quality
of Life Questionnaire percentile score), the effect sizes from the pilot study were used to determine that 16 subjects in
the treatment and control groups were sufficient. The smallest relevant between group effect size (d) was 1.37 and
smallest within group effect size (d) was 0.63 (Schall, Under Review). These moderate to large effect sizes were
reduced to determine a minimum power of estimate of 80% for a sample size of 16 (N=32). The power analysis
indicated that a between group effect size (d) of 1.10 with a sample size 16 (N=32) had 0.85 power (95%CL = 0.81 to
0.88) and a within group effect size (d) of 0.25 had 0.90 power (95%CL = 0.87 to 0.92) with alpha set at 0.05 when
using a mixed model with SAS® PROC MIXED with three time points and two levels (SAS® v9.4, 2013). In this
balanced design, power greater than or equal to .80 is often assumed to be adequate and acceptable to detect the
difference of a given magnitude in the mean outcome for the two groups, holding the significance level (a = .05)
constant.
We anticipate that the individuals providing information will include:
38 Individuals with ASD
38 Parents of individuals with ASD
20 Teachers of individuals with ASD
Total = 96
4. * List the study inclusion criteria:
In order to be selected for inclusion in the sample pool, participants must meet the following criteria: (1) A diagnosis of
Autism Spectrum Disorder; (2) between 18 - 22 years of age; (3) entering final year of school participation and is on
track to receive a diploma or a certificate; (4) meets eligibility requirements for vocational rehabilitation; (5) possesses
independent personal hygiene, eating and grooming skills; (5) able to pass drug screen and felony check and have
immunizations up to date (These items will be seen by the community business only as required by them for interns to
be present at their work site); and (6) desires and plans to work competitively in the community at the conclusion of the
9-month program, (7) Be a military dependent or military connected youth.
5. * List the study exclusion criteria:
Individuals who do not meet the inclusion criteria will be excluded from the study. Additionally, Students who will be
excluded are those who cannot consent or assent to the research due to age or mental incapacity. In some cases,
students will be of legal age but will be under the guardianship of their parent(s) or other legally authorized
representative (LAR).
6. * Will individuals with limited English proficiency be included in or excluded  from this research?
Included
Excluded - safety concerns if participants are unable to communicate with the study team
Excluded - instruments/measures only validated in English
Excluded - no prospect of direct benefit to individual participants
Excluded - minimal risk study
Excluded - lack of budget/resources for translation and interpretation [provide an explanation in next question]
Excluded - other reason [provide an explanation in next question]
7. Justify the inclusion and exclusion criteria if you are either targeting, or excluding, a particular segment of the
population / community. Provide a description of the group/organization/community and provide a rationale.
Only those who are not able to consent or assent will be excluded from this research. We are targeting military
dependents due to their double disadvantage as youth with ASD and military dependents. Specifically, Military
dependents with ASD who are transitioning from school to employment experience greater disadvantages than their
non-military peers with ASD. For example, relocation and deployment in service to our nation may unwittingly trigger
many of the conditions associated with poor transition outcomes for youth with ASD. Specifically, life in the military may
lead to increased stress, lower social skills, and increased maladaptive behavior for the individual with ASD.
Additionally, due to frequent moves, the family may lack access to local resources to support the individual with ASD
(Lincoln & Sweeten, 2011). Finally, there have been no research intervention studies to explore treatment models
targeted to transition aged military dependents with ASD.

Study Procedures
  
1. * Describe the study hypothesis and/or research questions.  Use lay language whenever possible.
There are three primary and three secondary endpoints under investigation in this study: (1) Employment status, (2)
wage, (3) number of hours worked per week at 12 and 18-months post enrollment. In addition, the effect of the
intervention on (5) social communication, (6) mental health, and (7) quality of life will be explored. Specifically, our
hypotheses are:
Hypothesis 1: Young adults who participate in an employer-based employment training and placement program will
demonstrate a higher rate of employment than those in the control condition.
Hypothesis 2: Young adults who participate in a work-based employment training and placement program will earn
higher wages on average compared to those in the control condition.
Hypothesis 3: Young adults who participate in a work-based employment training and placement program will work
more hours per week on average than those in the control condition.
Hypothesis 4: Young adults who participate in a work-based employment training and placement program will increase
their social responsiveness skills compared to those in the control condition, as measured by the Social Responsive
Scale, 2nd Ed.
Hypothesis 5: Young adults who participate in a work based employment training and placement program will display
lower anxiety and depression scores than those in the control condition as measured by the Behavior Assessment
System for Children, 3rd Ed. Teacher Rating Scales – Adolescent version.
Hypothesis 6: Young adults who participate in a work based employment training and placement program will report
higher quality of life scores than those in the control condition as measured by the Quality of Life Questionnaire.
2. * Describe the study's specific aims or goals.  Use lay language whenever possible.
The objective of this proposed project is to study the impact of Project SEARCH plus Autism Spectrum Disorders
Supports (PS+ASD) on the social communication, behavioral, and employment outcomes of military dependents with
ASD using a randomized clinical trial with a wait-list control group. We propose to implement an efficacious
intervention, PS+ASD, for 18 – 22 year old military dependents with ASD, to measure the effect of this intervention on
community-based competitive employment, social communication, mental health, and quality of life. The primary
objective of this research is to determine if subjects who receive PS+ASD have greater improvement in three
vocational domains (employment status, wage, number of hours worked per week) than subjects in a wait-list control
group at 12 and 18 -months post-enrollment.
Secondary Objectives. To assess differences in three personal domains (social communication, mental health, and
quality of life) for the treatment and wait-list control groups at baseline, 12 and 18-months post enrollment.
Exploratory Objectives. Exploratory objectives are to compare the three vocational domains and three personal
domains at baseline, 12 and 18-months post enrollment in subjects receiving the treatment compared to those in the
wait-list control group.
Aims. The aims of this project are to (1) Modify PS+ASD Model for Military Dependents, (2) implement the intervention
based upon the PS+ASD manual with the addition of the modified elements and will measure fidelity of
implementation, (3) measure the impact of the intervention on the employment outcomes social communication, mental
health and quality of life of the military dependents who participate compared to an equal control group who do not
receive the intervention.

4. * Describe the study procedures/methods for identifying and recruiting participants. Address all of the
following three aspects of recruitment in your response. 
1. Identification of potentially eligible participants or secondary data/specimens of interest.
     - What database(s) will be queried to identify secondary data/specimens
     - How VCU Informatics or VCU IRDS will be used for cohort identification (when applicable, see help text)
    - How potential participants' contact information will be obtained
2. Recruitment procedures to invite participation in the study (when applicable):
     - How each of the written or verbal recruitment materials and reminders (selected above) will be used
     - Who will contact, approach, or respond to potential participants
     - Locations where recruitment procedures will take place
     - The timing and frequency of recruitment attempts
3. Eligibility screening prior to consent and how those activities will be carried out (when applicable)
See the help text for additional guidance.
Students will be recruited through their schools through (a) a flyer advertising an informational meeting for students
and parents with information about the study; (b) a letter to students and parents sent by the school, and (c) regularly
scheduled Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meetings at which parents and students attend. Information about the
study will be provided to students and to their families.
Potential participants will submit an application that contains their contact information. (See Application for Participation
located in the recruitment materials sections).
Recruitment activities will be held from January through May of years 1 and 2. Recruitment may occur in year 3 if there
is significant attrition of participants. Once all participants are enrolled and identified, we will assign a number to each
enrolled participant and complete randomization using a random numbers generator on a computer. The individual
completing randomization will not know the identity or group to which individuals are assigned.
Recruitment procedures will be completed as follows:
1. Each school district representative who participates on the coordinating team will schedule an informational meeting
in their school division for potential participants from their schools.
2. Applications and flyers announcing informational meetings will be sent to all school district representatives to share
with potential participants in January of years 1, 2, and potentially 3.
3. Informational meetings will be held at the times and in the locations identified by the school district representatives.
4. If potential participants or their family members are unable to attend the informational meetings, VCU staff will meet
with them at a time and location of their choosing.
5. At each informational meeting, potential participants and their family members will receive an application with
instructions on how to apply, when and where to deliver completed applications.
6. VCU staff will answer any questions from potential participants regarding the research.
7. Upon receipt of the application, VCU staff will coordinate with the screening team to schedule screening interviews
in a private location that is convenient to the potential participant and their family members.
Screening Procedures:
There will be two screening meetings held for all potential participants. The first meeting, the research screening
meeting, will be for the purposes of completing consent and assent documentation, completing the subject eligibility
checklist and reviewing research procedures with potential participants and their family members. This first research
screening meeting will include the researcher or their designee, the potential participant, and their family members or
guardians only. It will be held at a location of the participant and their family's choosing that is private with a door that is
able to be closed to further maintain privacy. If the potential participant and their guardians agree to participate by
signing the consent and assent documents, a second "Project SEARCH Screening meeting will be scheduled.
The Project SEARCH Screening meeting will be held in private locations convenient to the potential participant and
their family members. These are most often held at the potential participant's school in a closed room, such as a
guidance counselor's meeting room. The following people from the Project SEARCH team participate:
1. A VCU representative trained in the research protocol and completing consent/assent discussions
2. A Project SEARCH teacher or job coach
3. A Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services Counselor
4. The Coordinating team member from the school division where the potential participant receives their education.
4. The potential participant
5. The potential participant's family members
6. The potential participant's current teacher (if acceptable to the potential participant)
During this meeting, the team mentioned above will complete the Student Screening and Interview Rubric.
In some cases, the potential participant is unable to verbally participate or has difficulty answering questions in the
screening interview. When that is the case, the student will be asked if the VCU Representative and/or the Project
SEARCH teacher or job coach can observe the potential participant in their classroom at their home school. The
purpose of this observation is to be able to answer questions through observation that the person or their team could
not answer in the interview.
(See the attached Student Screening Interview and Rubric in the Supporting Documents)
5. * Does this study have a separate protocol document (i.e. a multisite or sponsor's protocol) that contains a
detailed description of the study's methodology?
  Yes
No
6. * Since a separate protocol document is not uploaded, describe the proposed research using language
understandable to those IRB committee members whose expertise is not scientific. The description must
include:
 1. A statement explaining the study design
 2. A detailed description of all the procedures that will be followed to carry out the study, preferably in
sequential order, and in sufficient detail that the study's methods could be replicated
 3. The schedule and frequency of when and how procedures will be conducted (e.g. in person, online, phone,
paper, etc.)
 4. A description of all research measures/tests/interventions that will be used, including analyses/tests
conducted on specimens/biological samples (if applicable)
See the help text for additional guidance
This is a randomized, wait-list controlled study of the efficacy of the Project Search plus ASD Supports Model
(PS+ASD) in 32 adolescents and young adults aged 18 to 22 with ASD. Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled and
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment or wait-list control. A sufficient number of potential subjects will be screened to
achieve this number of enrolled subjects.
The six dependent variables in question are the primary endpoint employment rate (upon completion and at 12 months
and 18 months post-enrollment) and the secondary endpoints hourly wages, hours/week, Social Responsiveness
Scale total score, Behavior Assessment System for Children 3rd Ed. Anxiety and Depression t-score and the Quality of
Life Questionnaire percentile score at baseline (Baseline), 12 months post enrollment (12 months), and 18 months
post-enrollment (18 months). The efficacy of the intervention will be analyzed by comparing the differences in these six
variables between the treatment group and the control group.
The study will take place at Fort Eustis in collaboration with the local school division, Newport News, Hampton City,
York County, Williamsburg James City County Public Schools, and the New Horizons Regional Education Center
where most military dependents receive their education. The participating public schools will identify a teacher
consultant and instructional assistant to staff the project. Additionally, we will collaborate with a variety of department at
Fort Eustis Military base where the project will be housed. We will also collaborate with the Virginia Department of
Aging and Vocational Rehabilitation Services (DARS) as well as Business Connections, VCU’s Community
Rehabilitation Provider for job coaching services. At baseline, we will collect demographic and descriptive data to assist
us in identifying and describing the prior experiences and current situation for the participants in the study. The
demographic variables collected will be age, gender, and race. We will also collect information regarding the military
dependent with ASD’s parents’ military status including identification of the currently serving military parent(s), living
situation, school division where served, and the current location of assignment of first and/or second military parent. In
addition, we will collect total household income in ranges to assess the variability of employment outcomes based upon
yearly total household income. We will collect diagnostic information regarding the participant including medical
diagnosis, primary educational disability category, secondary educational disability category and intelligence quotient.
Finally, we will collect information regarding the participant’s work, internship, and educational experience. In addition
to these variables, we will also complete the Support Intensity Scale (SIS).43 The SIS is an interview based
assessment tool that identifies the type, amount, and frequency of support required by individuals with significant
disabilities, including persons with autism, to perform 57 life activities. An additional 28 items address behavioral and
medical areas. The assessment is completed through an interview with the individual, as well as family, school, and
community members with in-depth knowledge of the individual. The assessment generates a composite scale score
and individual scale scores in the areas of home living, community living, lifelong learning, employment, health and
safety, and social areas. Completion of the SIS will allow us to describe the impact that the military dependents
experiences as a result of their ASD. It is also a clinical tool that will allow us to ensure that all participants get the
appropriate level of support to achieve their desired outcome. All collected paper data will be stored in locked file
cabinets. All electronic data will be de-identified and stored in encrypted files on encrypted, password protected
computers. All data collectors will be trained to complete all data collection to protect the confidentiality of the
participants. In some cases where participants are not able to answer questions on the measures, parents or
guardians may be asked to answer these questions. Because this will be determined on a case by case basis, parents
and guardians will also be considered research participants for the purposes of consent.
Project SEARCH is an intensive 9-month job training program where youth with developmental disabilities in their last
year of high school are embedded in a large community business such as a hospital, government complex, or banking
center where they rotate through three 10-12 week internships within the business. Subjects will log approximately 720
hours of internship time learning marketable skills and 180 hours of business site classroom time learning social
communication and adaptive behavior for a total of approximately 900 hours embedded in the business setting. In
order to meet the unique needs of youth with ASD, Wehman, et al. enhanced the Project SEARCH model by adding
autism supports to the original model. Those added supports were: 1) on-site, intensive, systematic instruction using
the principles of applied behavior analysis, 2) on-site support and consultation from a behavior/autism specialist, and 3)
intensive staff training in ASD and the Project SEARCH Model. This resulted in PS+ASD. It is the impact of this
intervention for military dependents with ASD we will assess through this project.
As a part of this study, we will collect the following educational records:
1. The Individualized Education Plan for each student.
2. The student's attendance record to assess the student's fitness to participate in the study
3. The student's transcript to insure eligibility for the study
4. The student's prior work/study history for demographic information
5. Any prior career assessment information to assist in understanding the student's job training desires and needs.
Participation in this study will not be considered a part of the credits a student needs to complete graduation
requirements.
We have submitted and received approval for our research protocol from the Human Research Protection Office of the
DoD.
Prior to enrollment, each potential participant will complete an application for participation and will also complete a
screening interview. Neither the application nor the screening interview will be used to collect data for research
purposes. Instead, these activities are standard parts of the Project SEARCH program. The screening interview serves
three purposes. First, it allows the team to describe Project SEARCH to the potential participant and ask any questions
they may have. Second, it allows the research team to review the consent and assent documents and give participants
an opportunity to ask questions about the research procedures. Third, it gives the Project SEARCH team the
opportunity to interview the potential participant to learn more about their future career goals and to confirm their
support needs. All screening meetings are held in private locations convenient to the potential participant and their
family members. These are most often held at the potential participant's school in a closed room, such as a guidance
counselor's meeting room. The following people from the Project SEARCH team participate:
1. A VCU representative trained in the research protocol and completing consent/assent discussions
2. A Project SEARCH teacher or job coach
3. A Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services Counselor
4. The Coordinating team member from the school division where the potential participant receives their education.
4. The potential participant
5. The potential participant's family members
6. The potential participant's current teacher (if acceptable to the potential participant)
In some cases, the potential participant is unable to verbally participate or has difficulty answering questions in the
screening interview. When that is the case, the student will be asked if the VCU Representative and/or the Project
SEARCH teacher or job coach can observe the potential participant in their classroom at their home school. The
purpose of this observation is to be able to answer questions through observation that the person or their team could
not answer in the interview.
(See the attached Student Screening Interview and Rubric in the Supporting Documents)
7. * The IRB only reviews research activities, so indicate for each of the study activities described in the question
above or in the protocol which activities are:
  - Being performed exclusively for research purposes (i.e. they would not otherwise be done apart from this
study) VERSUS.
  - Alterations of routine activities/procedures (e.g. the study is altering the timing, frequency, method,
location, amount, etc.) VERSUS.
  - Being done for other purposes and whose data/results will be used secondarily in the study (e.g. standard
medical or psychological tests, routine education practices, quality improvement initiatives, etc.).
    See the help text for additional guidance
The following procedures will be implemented for research purposes:
Screening
Consent
Randomization
Assessment using:
the Support Intensity Scale
Interview using the baseline and 12 and 18 month follow-up interview

Services provided by a job coach
COVID-19 Contingency Plans
During the COVID-19 Crisis, we will meet with families and teams via phone or video conference. We will not hold any
face to face or in-person contacts. When ever we hold such a meeting, at least two research staff will participate on the
phone or video conference. Also, our research staff, who may be working from home, will ensure that they are in a
private room in their homes where other's cannot hear their conversations.
8. If applicable, describe alternatives (research or non-research) that are available to potential participants if they
choose not to participate in this study:
The only alternative to participation in this study is not to participate.
If a student decides not to take part in the study, but is interested in work experiences like Project SEARCH, we will
refer them to other similar programs if there are any in their locality.
9. Upload any supporting tables or documents (e.g. protocol documents, figures/tables, data collection forms,
study communications/reminders):
Upload ALL instruments/guides that will be used or that participants will experience (i.e. see, hear, complete),
including measures, scripts/questions to guide interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observational guides,
etc,:

Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Project Details
An intervention includes both physical procedures by which information or biospecimens are gathered (e.g., venipuncture) and
manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes.
An interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject. It may include in-person,
online, written, or verbal communications.
Secondary information/biospecimens are information or biospecimens that have been or will be collected for some other
“primary” or “initial” activity and that will be used secondarily in the research study.
 
1. * Select all of the following types of interventions that apply to this study (selections will branch):
 Social/Behavioral interventions or experimentation / Tasks / Environmental manipulations
 Deception (misleading participants through false or incomplete information)
Drug(s) / Biologics / Supplement(s) / Other Compounds (investigational products or products whose
administration is dictated by the study protocol and not per the physician's clinical judgment)
 IV contrast administration for research-related imaging (will branch to the Drugs page)
 Placebos
Safety and/or effectiveness evaluation of Bio-Medical Device(s), including in-vitro diagnostic devices/assays,
mobile medical apps, software functions, and HUDs used in clinical investigations
 Washout Periods
 Expanded Access – Treatment Use of an Investigational Product
 Medical or Surgical Procedures (eg: physical exam, clinical procedures, scans, etc)
 Specimen/biological sample collection
 None of the Above
2. * Select all of the following types of interactions and methods of data collection that apply to this study
(selections will branch):
 Surveys / Questionnaires /Written responses to questions (including data entry)
Active Internet data collection (i.e. using the internet to collect data, including online surveys, data collection via
Zoom, apps, etc.)
 Passive Internet data collection (i.e. passively observing online behavior, bots)
 Interviews / Focus Groups / Verbal responses to questions
 Audio / Video recording or photographing participants
 Observations
 Educational Settings/Assessments/Procedures
 None of the Above
3. * Select all types of recordings that will be made:
 Audio
 Video
 Photographs
4. * Describe the purpose of the recordings, who will be recorded and when such recordings will occur:
The purpose of the recordings is to demonstrate intervention procedures to professionals seeking to understand the
intervention and the needs of the students involved in the study. We will collect both video and photographs to be used
in presentations to illustrate how the Project SEARCH plus ASD Supports model is implemented.
Both video and photographic data is collected to increase our ability to tell the story of these individuals' journey
through the program. It is used in presentation and will not be used as a source for research data collection. It allows
us to show people with disabilities in photographic form demonstrating competency. We also use the photos to show
some of the specific supports people with ASD require at work. We use this data for the purposes of educating others
regarding the Project SEARCH plus ASD model.
5. * Describe the impact this study might have on students' opportunity to learn required educational content:
This project will neither increase not decrease the participant's opportunity to learn required content as community
based employment training is included in student with disabilities' curriculum.
6. * Select all types of secondary information and/or specimens that apply to this study (selections will branch):
See the help text for definitions.
 Individually Identifiable Health Information (PHI)
 Secondary data/specimens NOT from a research registry or repository
 Information/specimens from a research registry or repository (Usage Protocol)
 Information/specimens originally collected for a previous research study
 Publicly available information/specimens
Government-generated or collected information that was or will be obtained for nonresearch activities [only
applicable to research conducted by or on behalf of a Federal department or agency]
 No secondary data/specimens will be used

Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Behavioral Intervention/Task Details
This page asks for details about the social/behavioral intervention, task, or environmental manipulation in the research.
 
Interventions include both physical procedures by which information is gathered and manipulations of the subject or the
subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. This might include activities such as playing computer
games, performing a task, thought/cognition activities, environmental manipulations, and educational activities.
If the study only involves surveys, interviews, or secondary data collection, go back to the Project Details page and uncheck
“Social/Behavioral interventions or experimentation / Tasks / Environmental manipulations” in Question 1.
1. * Describe the duration of the social/behavioral intervention, task, or environmental manipulation:
The Project SEARCH + ASD Supports intervention is a 9-month intervention.
2. * Describe any potential harms or discomforts that participants could experience during the intervention
activity:
The only potential harm or discomfort participants might experience is possible loss of confidentiality.
3. * Will the intervention activity be physically invasive or painful?
  Yes
No
4. * Describe the impact the intervention activity will have on participants, including the nature and duration of
any impact(s):
The potential impact of the intervention is that participants may acquire employment upon completion of the
intervention. The nature of that impact is desirable and the duration of employment may vary depending on the
participant's needs and abilities.
5. * In the investigator's opinion, is there any reason to think that the participants will find the intervention
activity offensive or embarrassing? Explain why or why not.
We do not believe the participants will find the intervention offensive or embarrassing. We have concluded this
because we have tested this intervention in other locations and no participants have reported feeling embarrassed or
offended by the intervention. We also work with participating intervention sites to educate them regarding the needs
and abilities of youth and young adults with ASD. Finally, we provide on-going support to participants and the sites to
ensure that participants receive support in their participation to avoid embarrassing or offensive situations.

Compensation
It is recommended that investigators consult with VCU Procurement Services  before proposing a compensation plan
(monetary or non-monetary) to the IRB to ensure the plan will comply with VCU policies. Refer to WPP XVII-2  for the IRB’s
guidelines about compensating research participants.
1. * Describe any compensation that will be provided including:
   1. total monetary amount
   2. type (e.g., gift card, research pre-paid card, cash, check, merchandise, drawing, extra class credit)
   3. how it will be disbursed
   4. how you arrived at this amount
   5. What identifiers and tax forms will be required for compensation purposes (i.e. W-9 form, SSN, V#,
addresses, etc.)
A $300 research Incentive will be given to all participants across the study.
2. If compensation will be pro-rated, explain the payment schedule.
Data collection baseline = $75.00, Data collection 12 months = $75.00, Data collection 18 months = $75.00, As an
incentive for completion of all data collection points, all participants who participate in all three data collection points will
receive an additional $75.00 bonus at the 18 month data collection point. Total potential compensation across the 18
months of the study is $300.00 per participant.

Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Contingency Plan
This page will be used by the IRB in the event that an institution-wide emergency situation arises that requires
contingency plans. 
A contingency plan describes the alternative procedures that a study would want to use in case of an emergency that
prevented normal study activities from occurring. It is a form of adaptive protocol. It enables the VCU IRB to quickly
approve alternative study activities along with criteria for when those activities would or would not be put into effect.
For example, in 2020, some studies had a COVID-19 Contingency Protocol approved that described alternative
remote procedures that they would switch to whenever the University restricted in-person research activities.
In all studies, investigators are strongly encouraged to plan prospectively and build flexibilities into their regular
protocols (regardless of whether an emergency situation exists) as well as think about what they would do in an
emergency situation. For example, windows for timed study visits, ranges instead of exact values, flexibilities in
inclusion criteria, etc. Flexibility and adaptations that are built into the protocol will reduce the number of changes
that have to be submitted to the IRB and should reduce the number of incidents of deviations and noncompliance by
investigators.
Further instructions and smartform questions on this page will be released from the IRB in the event of such an
institution-wide emergency situation.

Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Risks, Discomforts, Potential Harms and Monitoring
1. * Describe the risks of each research procedure to participants or others. For each identified risk, provide an
assessment of the anticipated seriousness and likelihood of the risk. Some examples of possible risks include
but are not limited to:
Physical risks (e.g. bodily harms or discomforts, side effects, etc.)
Psychological risks (e.g. emotional, mental, or spiritual harms or discomforts, changes to thoughts,
beliefs, or behaviors, etc.)
Research data risks (e.g. loss of confidentiality and privacy)
Social or legal risks (e.g. impacts on relationships or reputation, legal or criminal justice actions for self
or others, etc.)
Financial risks (e.g. impacts on income, employability, or insurability, loss of services, etc.)
Other risks (e.g. unforeseeable risks of experimental procedures, risks related to particular study
designs (randomization, washout, placebo, withholding care/services, deception), etc.)
See the help text for additional guidance.
The potential physical or psychological risks to participants are minimal and do not exceed those that would be
incurred by students who do not participate. The potential participants in this study currently receive community-based
education and training as planned in this proposal. The only additional risks to participants would be loss of
confidentiality or possible exposure to negative comments about their disabilities from employees or customers of the
employment training sites.
In addition, students and parents may find some of the questions we ask during discomforting or distressing. If that is
the case, students or their parents may skip that question, ask us to stop that line of questioning, or ask us to stop the
interview at any time.
2. * Describe how each of the risks/harms/discomforts identified above will be minimized:
Study records will be maintained in locked storage areas with access only to individuals engaged in the research. No
information about the study will include information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify participants. This
statement refers to both reporting and storage of study data. One person on the research team will have a unique
identifier code list all protocols and electronic data will be coded with that unique identifier. The list will be encrypted on
a password protected computer and will be maintained in paper copy in a locked filing cabinet. Thus, stored electronic
and paper data will be separated from the unique identifier code. No individual will be referenced in any reporting of
data.
Support personnel will be available to provide education and counseling to
participants. In the event that a participant required professional services from a psychologist or behavioral counselor,
support personnel will refer that individual to properly licensed services. Participants will access these services at their
own cost through their own resources including insurance or other funding.
We can guarantee that all locations where the Project SEARCH research intervention occurs will be EEOC compliant,
however, we cannot guarantee that, once a participant leaves the intervention, their future job will be at an EEOC
compliant location.
During the COVID-19 crisis, we will not be holding any face-to-face or in person interactions. We will hold all meetings
via phone or video conference. We will have at least two research staff on the phone or video conference. We will also
email all forms to participants. Finally, we will have research staff ensure that they are in a private space in their homes
away from others overhearing the conversation. We will ask participants to do the same if they wish.
3. * Describe any potential risks or harms to a community or a specific population based on study findings (e.g.
information that could be stigmatizing or derogatory):
There are no potential risks or harms to a community or specific population based on the study findings known.
4. Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical, professional, or psychological
intervention in the event of adverse events to the subjects:
There are no plans to provide medical, professional, or psychological intervention to participants in the study. If such
services are needed by participants, we will refer them to their own medical doctors or another community doctor
psychologist or psychiatrists. Participants will bear financial responsibility for that care. The types of events that may
result in referral to a student's home doctor includes minor first aid emergencies, illness, or visible signs of emotional
distress, such that the student cannot continue with there daily activities. There is no person individually responsible for
making such determinations. Rather the site coordinator on-site will be trained in first aid and will address any minor
emergencies as they occur. We will notify ORSP and HRPO of any reportable events immediately upon becoming
aware of the event. We will comply with all audits and reviews of our research procedures and protocols. Additionally,
We will notify ORSP and HRPO of any additional risks discovered in the conduct of this research.
5. * Describe criteria for when the investigator would withdraw an individual participant from the study; such as
safety or toxicity concerns, emotional distress, inability to comply with the protocol, etc.:
As noted previously, participants who are placed in the community based employment training program will not go to
their home high school. Instead, they will receive their education in the employment training program. In the event that
a participant can no longer participate in the study due to emotional distress or inability to comply with the study
protocol, we will contact the participant or their LAR, and the placing home school division to ensure a smooth
transition from the study back to their home high school.
6. * Summarize any pre-specified criteria that would trigger the investigator/sponsor/monitoring committee to
stop or change the study protocol due to safety concerns:
In the event that the study site becomes unsafe, or the findings indicate significant risk to participants, we will stop the
study. In doing so, we will contact the participant or their LAR, and the placing home school division to ensure a
smooth transition from the study back to their home high school. We will review all potential sites to ensure their
compliance with safety procedures prior to initiating any off site employment training. This review will include ensuring
that the community employment training site in question meets all VCU emergency procedures including fire, OSHA,
and inclement weather safety protocols.  
Data and Safety Monitoring
Data and safety monitoring is a system for checking the study’s data at regular intervals over the study period
to identify and address issues that could affect the safety of research participants. This requirement is in
accordance with 45 CFR 46.111.
The purpose of data and safety monitoring plan is to set forth study team procedures for
monitoring/addressing:
- Participant safety (physical, psychological, etc.)
- Data validity
- Early stopping (termination) based upon changes in risks and benefits.
7. * Indicate if this study will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or a Data Safety Monitoring Plan
(DSMP): [Required for all greater than minimal risk studies]
 DSMB
 DSMP
 No DSMB/DSMP [Note: This response is not applicable for greater than minimal risk studies]

Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Privacy
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control how others view, record, or obtain information about them. When
privacy is violated it can involve such things as
Being asked personal questions in a public setting;
Being publicly identified as having a particular characteristic or diagnosis;
Being seen entering a place that might be stigmatizing;
Being photographed, videotaped or observed without consent;
Disclosure of personal information to unauthorized people
Privacy is not the same as confidentiality because privacy protections apply to people, and confidentiality
protections apply to data. Confidentiality protections should be described on the Data Confidentiality page of this
form, not here.
Instructions for this page:
Select all the applicable ways that the research team will protect participants' privacy throughout the course of the
study. The options listed include some of the most common best practices. Not all will be applicable to every study. 
**The IRB will expect studies to operationalize all selected checkboxes into the conduct of the research.
 
To elaborate on any response, also click the “Other Protections” checkbox to provide further explanation in the last
free-text question.
Read the entire page before filling out the form.
 
1. * Protections when conducting one-on-one in-person interventions or interactions (for groups see Q2 below):
Conducting study activities in locations that maximize privacy (limited people around, closing doors,
drawing drapes around beds, monitoring voice volume, etc.)
 Verifying identity before discussing personal information.
 Asking the participant if they are comfortable answering questions in that location
 Asking the participant if they are comfortable with having other people present (if any)
 Moving away from other people when conducting activities in public spaces or offering a private space
Offering other options of ways to respond to sensitive questions (i.e. pointing, clicking, or writing) if
uncomfortable verbally responding
Using generic signs on research rooms and spaces, particularly for research on stigmatizing or
sensitive topics
 Other protections not listed in this question – describe below
 N/A – study has no in-person interventions or interactions with participants
 
2. * Protections when conducting group interventions or interactions:
Conducting study activities in locations that maximize privacy (limited people passing by, closing doors,
monitoring voice volume, etc.)
 Moving to a more private area to answer questions or to discuss concerns
Discussing privacy with the participants and the importance of not talking outside the group about what
other people say during the group session
 Allowing participants to use a pseudonym or limiting use of individuals’ names during the group activity
Asking everyone in a public group setting (e.g. classrooms, workshops) to turn something in (blank or filled) so
participants do not have to self-identify when turning in materials
 Collecting paper forms in a closed box or envelope rather than passing to others or leaving in an open area
Limiting participant identifiers that would be visible on paper documents (i.e. using study IDs instead of

additional guidance .
All meetings, including identification, recruitment, screening, consent, and data collection interviews specific to the
research where students may be identified as receiving special education services will be conducted in a private room
that is convenient to the student and their caretakers/parents. Additionally, when completing data collection
procedures, we will meet with participants individually at a private location of their choosing. Finally, data disseminated
from the study will be aggregated. No individual participant data will be disseminated from the study.
Students will have the opportunity to select the location for meetings and ensure the privacy of that location prior to
participation. Finally, students may, but are not required to attend the informational meeting regarding the research. If a
student prefers to have the information at the informational meeting shared with them privately, we will make
arrangements to do so.
During the COVID-19 crisis, all video calls will be completed using VCU approved video conferencing software. We will
send all documents via email using the secure email function provided by VCU.

 N/A – no email/online communications
6. Specify any other places where this study’s paper and electronic research data and/or physical specimens will
be stored and any other ways they will be secured from improper use and disclosure. 
See the help text for additional guidance.
Study records will be maintained in locked storage areas with access only to individuals engaged in the research. We
will create an unique identifier for each individual for all electronic records and databases for data analysis. Only one
person will have access to the code key so that others reviewing data will not be able to track individual data back to
specific participants. No information about the study will include information that can be used to directly or indirectly
identify participants. Electronic information will be stored on a encrypted computers and encrypted flash drives. All
paper and electronic records will be stored within the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center, a center within the
School of Education. No data will be stored in the School of Medicine.
All meetings and interviews specific to the research where students may be identified as receiving special education
services will be conducted in a private room. Additionally, when completing data collection procedures, we will meet
with participants individually at a private location of their choosing.
During the COVID-19 crisis, only the PI, Dr. Paul Wehman, Co-I, Dr. Carol Schall, Research Coordinators, Dr. Lauren
Avellone, and Ms. Jennifer McDonough, and the Research Assistant, Ms. Hannah Seward will be allowed to have hard
copies of study data in their homes. All study data maintained in the home during this crisis will be placed in a location
in the person's home where others in the home will not have access to or be able to view the documents.
7. * If research data/specimens will be sent/released to person(s) or group(s) outside of the VCU study team or
the PI’s department for the conduct of this protocol (not for future sharing),
1) identify the data/specimen recipient(s) along with their VCU department or other institutional or
organizational affiliation(s).
2) give a description of what identifiers and/or codes will accompany the data/specimens.
If data/specimens are not being sent/released outside of the VCU study team or the PI’s department, state that:
None of the 18 HIPAA identifiers will be released to persons or groups outside the VCU Study team.
8. * Select all identifiers that will be collected at any time as part of this study (including for recruitment, data
gathering, data analysis, etc.), even if the data will eventually be anonymized:
 Names
 Geographic Locators Below State Level
 Social Security Numbers
 Dates (year alone is not an identifier)
 Ages over 89 (age under 89 is not an identifier)
 Phone Numbers
 Facsimile Numbers
 E-mail Addresses
 Medical Record Numbers
 Device Identifiers
 Biometric Identifiers
 Web URLs
 IP Addresses
 Account Numbers
 Health Plan Numbers
 Full Face Photos or Comparable Images
 License/Certification Numbers
 Vehicle ID Numbers
 Other Unique Identifier
 No Identifiers
 Employee V#
9.   * If the study will code (i.e. de-identify) the research data by replacing subjects’ names and/or other identifiers
with assigned subject IDs, explain the following aspects of the coding process:
- The process for how subject IDs will be generated/assigned (e.g. random, sequential)
- Whether there will be a key that links the subject ID with direct identifiers. If there will be no linkage key, state
that.
If a key will be created, describe
- The place where the key will be stored
- The role(s) of all individuals who will have access to the key
- When the key will be destroyed
See the help text for guidance.  
Codes will be developed so that data will not be able to be connected with the participant in an electronic format. No
private health information will be collected. Additionally, all data subject to analysis will be coded so that data analysts
will not be able to identify individual participants. All study data will be stored in locked filing cabinets and in encrypted
computers in encrypted files or on encrypted flash drives. All passwords for each level of encryption will be different
from the previous passwords. Participants will be assigned individual numbers that are quasi-sequential. The code will
consist of a number indicating the cohort in which they enrolled, the school division from which they applied, a number
to indicate if they applied from the regional program added to their school division number, and a number indicating the
order in which their application was received. Numbers will be assigned by the on-site coordinator when the application
is received. Only the research coordinators and on-site coordinator will know the order of code and the meaning of
each of the numbers in the code. No other person associated with the study will know the meaning of the code. If the
participant elects to not enroll in the study or does not meet the inclusion criteria, their number will not be reassigned to
another participant. Consequently, numbers will not be sequential. The key will be kept in an encrypted, password
protected word document on an encrypted, password protected computer. Each of the passwords will be different. The
key will be destroyed once the IRB is closed for the study.
For the purposes of NDAR data sharing, we will assign each participant who consented to share their data a random
unique identifier developed from a random numbers table. We will not share their coded identifier, but will create a key
to match the coded identifier with the random number identifier. This key will be maintained by the research assistant
and data manager. It will be on an encrypted document maintained on an encrypted computer with different passwords
for each level of encryption. Only the research assistant and data manager will have access to this key. It will be kept
for the purposes of allowing participants to remove consent after having given consent initially. This key will be
destroyed once the study has closed with the IRB.

Data Retention
1. * Select all of the ways that individually identifiable information obtained during pre-screening and/or
screening will be handled for individuals who DO NOT qualify for the study:
 N/A - study does not require screening procedures
 Immediately destroy the information and identifiers (no data collected)
 Immediately destroy the identifiers connected with the data (anonymization)
 Store until the end of study & then destroy
 Use as "screening failure" data by members of the study team
 Provide to others outside of the research team (with the participant's permission)
 Request permission from participant to maintain and use the identifiable information
 Other
2. * Will participants be able to withdraw their data (paper, electronic, or specimens) from the study (e.g. ask that
it be destroyed or returned) if they no longer wish to participate? (FDA-regulated studies should select No –
see help text)
  Yes
No
3. * If Yes , describe the process (oral, written, email, letter, etc.) that participants should use to request
withdrawal of their data/specimens. Identify if there is a timepoint when withdrawal will no longer be an option
and/or if the amount of data that can be withdrawn is reduced at different points in the study.
Participants will contact study staff and request to withdraw from the study. Study staff will contact the participants
school division personnel and inform them of the participant's decision to withdraw. Study staff will work with school
division staff to ensure a smooth transition back to the home school division.
4. * What will happen to the research materials (e.g. data, specimens, documents, etc.) when the research has
been completed?
Stored indefinitely with identifiers removed
Stored indefinitely with identifiers attached
Destroyed at the end of study once the minimum time required for data retention has been met per VCU
Data Retention Policy and/or sponsor retention requirements
Destroyed when notified by sponsor but not less than the minimum time required for data retention per VCU
Data Retention Policy
Other
5. * Will audio/video recordings and full face photographs be destroyed?
  Yes
No
6. If yes, describe at what point and how recordings will be destroyed:
Recordings and photographs will be deleted from any portable camera or memory card and saved to encrypted,
password protected computers. No recording will be made unless the participant gives permission via the consent
process. Participants will have the right to remove permission to record them at any point. The consent document
clarifies this by informing subjects that they can request to stop pictures or video recording at any point and may
request to have the existing pictures and video recordings of them deleted. We will maintain pictures and video
recordings where we have permission until they are no longer of use for the purposes of training. Once those pictures
and video recordings are no longer of use, we will destroy all copies. Finally, we only share videos with project staff and
do not post them on open web based video platforms, such as "YouTube".
7. If no, explain why the recordings need to be maintained:
Recordings and photographs used for training purposes will be maintained to continue to provide training once the
study is complete.

HM20008778 - Paul Wehman
Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Sharing Plan
This page addresses times when investigators may be required to share information about participants or may desire
to share their research information/specimens with the aim of advancing science. This page creates a plan for when
and how information/specimens could be shared.
Try to anticipate all reasonably foreseeable sharing so that the consent document can also reflect that information.
However, it is acceptable to amend this page later and explain either how re-consent of previously and currently
enrolled participants will occur or why re-consent should not be required.
The IRB reviews this page against the consent document (if one exists) to demonstrate the ethical principle of
Respect for Persons by confirming that plans for sharing do not go against what participants would understand
about the use of their data/specimens.
The IRB also ensures there are adequate protections for the privacy of participants and the confidentiality of
participants' data/specimens when data is shared with others.
 
1. * Is it likely investigators could discover information about child/elder abuse or neglect that would require
mandatory reporting by the investigators or staff?
The Code of Virginia requires that most medical personnel and all employees of institutions of higher
education report suspected child/elder abuse or neglect.
  Yes
No
2. *  Is it likely investigators could discover a previously unknown reportable disease or condition that would
require mandatory reporting by the investigators or staff (i.e., HIV , coronavirus, hepatitis, etc.)?
  Yes No
3. * Will the sponsor or investigator obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study?
Certificates of Confidentiality  (CoC) are issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the FDA and CDC to
protect identifiable research information from forced disclosure. All human subject research studies
regardless of funding can qualify to receive a CoC. A CoC is automatically issued for research that was
ongoing on December 13, 2016. or initiated after that date. For more information, see
https://humansubjects.nih.gov/coc/
No – Will not obtain CoC for this study
Yes – CoC has been obtained or issued automatically
Yes – CoC request is pending
4. * Select the way(s) that information or biospecimens (including DNA) may be used by the VCU PI or VCU study
team for other future research projects (i.e. analyses beyond/apart from the aims of this study)?
See help text for definitions.
Will use directly identifiable information or specimens.
(‘Directly identifiable’ means that identifiers like name, medical record number, social security number, etc. are
included in/attached to the dataset/specimens. Maintaining identifiable data for future research is treated as a
registry by the VCU IRB. The IRB must approve the new research use in an amendment to this study or as part
of a new study before the project is initiated. VCU IRB studies will be asked more questions about this on a later
page )
Will use de-identified or indirectly identifiable information or specimens.
(‘De-identified’ means that a linkage/key code exists that links identifiers to data/specimens. When the
researcher holds both the data and the key, the VCU IRB considers the subjects to be readily identifiable.
Maintaining identifiable data for future research uses is treated by the IRB as a registry. The IRB must approve
the new research use in an amendment to this study or as part of a new study before the project is initiated.
VCU IRB studies will be asked more questions about this on a later page)
Will use anonymized information or specimens.
(‘Anonymized’ means that 1) no linkage/key codes exist that link identifiers to data/specimens; and 2) subjects
cannot be readily identified, i.e. no direct or indirect identifiers or identifiable combinations of variables. The VCU
IRB considers uses of anonymized data/specimens to not be human subject research.)
Will use aggregate results (summary-level results), not individual-level information or specimens.
(The VCU IRB considers uses of aggregate data to not be human subject research because there are no
individual subjects.)
Will contribute to an existing registry or repository
(VCU IRB studies will be asked more questions about this on a later page.)
 Will not use information/specimens for purposes beyond this study.
 Not sure and will submit an amendment when known
 Other use(s) of individual-level information in a way not listed above
5. * Select the way(s) the VCU PI/study team may share information or biospecimens (including DNA) with other
researchers who are not on this study team (i.e. for analyses beyond/apart from the aims of this study). 
See help text for definitions.
Will share directly identifiable information or specimens with other researchers.
(‘Directly identifiable’ means that identifiers like name, medical record number, social security number, etc. are
included in/attached to the dataset/specimens. Maintaining identifiable data for future research uses is treated
by the VCU IRB as a registry. The data recipient’s use of identifiable data would require them to obtain IRB
review. VCU IRB studies will be asked more questions about this on a later page.)
Will share de-identified or indirectly identifiable information or specimens with other researchers.
(‘De-identified’ means that a linkage/key code exists that links identifiers to data/specimens. The VCU
researcher maintains the key but does not share it with any other researchers. The recipient’s use of de-
identified data/specimens may not be human subject research if there is documentation that the key will never
be shared with the recipient, but they should check with their own IRB about review requirements. VCU IRB
studies will be asked more questions about this on a later page.)
Will share anonymized information or specimens with other researchers.
(‘Anonymized’ means that 1) no linkage/key codes exist that link identifiers to data/specimens; and 2) subjects
cannot be readily identified (i.e. no direct or indirect identifiers or identifiable combinations of variables). The
VCU IRB considers uses of anonymized data/specimens by other researchers to not be human subject
research, but the recipient should check with their own IRB about review requirements.)
Will only share aggregate results (summary-level results), not individual-level information or specimens.
(The VCU IRB considers uses of aggregate data to not be human subject research because there are no
individual subjects. The data recipient should check with their own IRB about review requirements.)

Will submit data to an NIH genomic data repository (VCU IRB studies will be asked more questions about this on
a later page.)
 Will not share information/specimens with other researchers.
 Not sure and will submit an amendment when known
 Other sharing of individual-level information with other researchers
6. * Since you responded in a question above that you may use or share anonymous, individual level data,
indicate why the proposed use or sharing of anonymous data/specimens is not inconsistent with what
participants would have reasonably understood from the consent document about the uses of their
information. (Select all that apply.)
The consent form states that after identifiers are removed, information or specimens could be used for
future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject (this is a new element of
consent included in consent templates as of May 2018)
The consent form or exempt information sheet is silent about whether/how information or specimens could be
used for future research studies.
The information or specimens were/will be obtained under a waiver of informed consent, waiver of HIPAA
authorization, or an exempt study that did not use an information sheet.
 Other reason why anonymous use/sharing is not inconsistent with the consent document
7. * The Principal Investigator certifies that prior to releasing an anonymized dataset or anonymized specimens
the following conditions will all be met:
 - all 18 HIPAA identifiers (including all dates) will be removed;
  - all indirectly identifiable data elements (unusual, rare, uncommon data) will be removed, grouped,
suppressed, or otherwise transformed to no longer be readily identifiable;
  - a different subject ID will be assigned than the one used for the main study and a linkage key will not be
kept; and
  - the PI will review the dataset/specimens to confirm that the remaining information could not be used alone
or in combination with any other information to re-identify the participants represented in the data.
See help text for more information .
Yes
No
8. * The Principal Investigator certifies that after the study has been closed with the VCU IRB, the following
conditions will be met whenever individual level research information and/or specimens are used or shared:
  - The identities of participants who are represented in the dataset/specimens will not be readily ascertainable
or otherwise re-identifiable by the recipient;
  - If a linkage/code key is created, it will be maintained at VCU and not shared with the recipient under any
circumstances;
  - The PI will have no knowledge that the remaining information could be used alone or in combination with
any other information to identify the individuals represented in the data; and
  - The PI agrees to abide by this sharing plan even after the study has been closed with the VCU IRB.
Yes
No
N/A - No sharing will occur

Existing Registry/Repository Details
1. Provide name(s) of the registry/repository, if applicable.
National Database for Autism Research (NDAR)
2. * Site having overall responsibility for the management of this registry/repository
VCU
Non-VCU
3. If registry is located at VCU, provide IRB number(s) for the registry/repository:
N/A
4. If VCU is not responsible for the management of this registry/repository describe the organization and/or
individual who is responsible:
The National Institutes of Health is responsible for this registry.
5. * Describe the research materials (data elements, specimens, recordings, etc.) that this study will contribute to
the registry/repository:
The following materials will be shared with NDAR:
Subject random number identifier
Subject random condition participation identifier
Subject coded and scored interview and assessment information
6. * List and describe any identifiers (including linkable codes) that will accompany data or samples to the
registry/repository.
Our unique ID will not be sent to the database, however, we will use a double coding process. Specifically, we will
assign each participant who consents to share their data a unique identifier that is not coded, but random. The reason
for the additional random code is to ensure that we can guarantee data removal for participants who choose to do so
after first consenting. The key will be kept by research assistant and data manager who will be the only person to have
this unique double coded key.
We will not share any recordings or other identifiable material or information.
7. If the participant gives specific permission for future use of this data/specimens in the informed consent,
address 1) what are the stipulations/conditions, if any (e.g., research only on diabetes) and 2) describe how
the registry/repository has a mechanism to capture,  utilize, and respect these conditions?
The only stipulations on future use of the data is ensuring that participants who withdrew consent were removed from
the database prior to closure of the study on or around 9/30/2020. If participants withdraw consent for their data to be
used the research assistant and data manager will remove that individual's data from the database.
8. If there is not a mechanism to capture the participants data use stipulations, explain why this is not necessary.
N/A
9. * If participants will be able to access their data and/or samples from the registry/repository for personal use,
explain how this will occur.
N/A
10.   * Explain how participants are allowed to request the data/samples be destroyed/removed from the
registry/repository or why it is not allowed:
Participants will notify the any study staff member to request removal of their data from the data repository. At that
point, the staff member will notify the research assistant and data manager to remove their data from NDAR.

View: SF2 - Pertinent Results and Incidental FindingsID: HM20008778
HM20008778 - Paul Wehman
Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Pertinent Results and Incidental Findings
1. * Is it likely investigators could discover a participant's previously unknown condition (e.g. pregnancy,
disease, suicidal thoughts, wrong paternity, genetic results, or other findings that may be of importance to
health or well-being) or if a participant is engaging in illegal or reportable activities:
  Yes
No
2. * Describe what possible pertinent results or incidental findings stemming from research-only procedures may
be discovered.
There are no known possible pertinent or incidental findings stemming from research-only procedures that may be of
importance to the subject's health or well-being or which may related to illegal or reportable activities. Should we
inadvertently discover suspected abuse or participation in illegal activity, we will immediately inform the relevant public
agencies including Adult Protective Services, counseling services, family members and support providers (as long as
they are not implicated in the suspected illegal activity), and other such authorities as the situation will require.
3. * Explain what actions or procedures research personnel should take to inform the PI of such a discovery :
We do not expect to discover such information. Should we inadvertently discover suspected abuse or participation in
illegal activity, we will immediately inform the relevant public agencies including Adult Protective Services, counseling
services, family members and support providers (as long as they are not implicated in the suspected illegal activity),
and other such authorities as the situation will require. The study team will not be involved in the collection of the data
regarding drug testing or background checks. Instead, we are assuring that the employer will complete these checks.
4. * Will findings be disclosed to participants and/or any other person/group outside of the study team?
  Yes
No
5. * Describe a communication plan addressing:
1. What criteria will be used to determine which pertinent and/or incidental findings will be communicated,
including the following for health related findings:
    --- The reliability of the tests/images, such as being done in a CLIA-certified lab,
    --- Whether the meaning and significance of the findings are known,
    --- Whether the findings reveal a significant risk of a serious health condition,
    --- Whether there is an accepted treatment for the health condition revealed by the findings, and
    --- The risks both of knowing and not knowing the findings, including risks to family members from genetic
testing results.
2. What information will be provided during the consent process about the plans for communicating pertinent
and/or incidental findings;
3. Whether the participants will be given the option of refusing communication of some or all types of
pertinent and/or incidental findings to themselves, their family members, and/or any other individuals or
groups; and
4. To whom and by whom the findings will be communicated, when, and how. 
1. The only criteria under which findings will be disclosed to participants and/or any other person/group outside the
study team will be if the findings reveal a significant risk of a serious health condition such as suspected abuse or
neglect by another person.
2. We share the following information with all participants and/or their legally authorized guardians during the consent
process:
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing voluntarily,
without your consent, information that would identify you as a participant in the research project
under the following circumstances:
If you or your students tells us you intend to hurt yourself or others, or if we learn about real or
suspected abuse.
3. Participants will not be given the option of refusing communication regarding the situation described above.
4. Findings related to threats of self harm or harm to others will be shared with the participant's parents or legally
authorized guardians, and, if necessary, legal authorities. Findings related to potential abuse or neglect will be share
with adult protective services.

Decisionally Impaired Adults
1. * Choose the nature of the decisional impairment participants will have:
Temporarily Incompetent to Give Consent
Permanently Incompetent to Give Consent
Unknown
2. * Explain why this population is necessary for the conduct of the study.
ASD is commonly associated with cognitive and language difficulties.
3. * Describe methods for determining whether participants are capable of providing consent or assent.
All prospective participants will be known to the staff of their respective schools, and school staff will be aware of which
students are capable or incapable of understanding the study or their involvement, and thus for providing informed
consent or assent to participate.
In addition, prior to initiating any study procedures, study staff will meet with each participant and their
caretakers/parents in a private location identified by the potential participant. During this screening meeting, the study
staff will review the consent/assent information, ask the participant or their LAR if they are willing to consent to
participate, and collect signatures and check marks on the consent/assent forms if the participant decides to
participate.
Once the potential participant and/or their LAR have consented to participate, research staff will conduct an informal
interview to assess the subject's eligibility based upon the inclusion criteria. They will record their findings on the
Subject Eligibility Checklist (attached in the documents section of this protocol).
In addition, the Project SEARCH program also requires a group interview with all participating agencies. This group
interview will be conducted at a time separate from the consent and screening meeting. This interview will take place in
a private location selected by the participant and their caretakers/parents and will be large enough to accommodate the
group interview. The group interview can include the following people:
1. The participant
2. Their caretakers/parents
3. The Project SEARCH teacher, job coach, or other Project SEARCH direct services staff
4. The student's teacher in their current school placement
5. An administrator from the student's school district
6. The Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services staff member
7. In some cases, the case manager of the individual's community services board
8. Other individual identified by the participant.
The purpose of this group interview is to complete the Student Selection Interview and Rubric as used in the Project
SEARCH program.
4. * If a participant is capable of exercising some judgment concerning the nature of the study, describe how
assent will be obtained.
During the consent meetings, the research staff member will ask questions of the students in order to verify
comprehension of the study and their involvement. We do not have specific questions to measure comprehension.
Instead, we will ask the student to describe in their own words or method their understanding of the study and what will
happen to them if they decide to become involved in the study. We will also ask them, in their own words or method of
communication (sign language, etc.) to indicate if they would like to participate in the study.
5. Describe, if applicable, how the individuals' ability to give consent will be assessed throughout the study and
how consent will be obtained when appropriate.
Through out the study, study staff will have on-going daily interaction with students and will continue to assess the
student's ability to consent or assent to participation in the study. In addition, all data collectors will ask each participant
if they are willing to continue in the research at each data collection point.  
6. * Describe how and when consent will be obtained from participants' legally authorized representative (LAR).
For those students who have a guardian or LAR, consent will be obtained from the guardian/LAR with assent from the
student. Students who are under guardianship will not be involved in the study in any manner without obtaining
consent of the guardian and assent of the student.

Effect of a 9-Month Internship Intervention for Military Dependents with ASD
  
Personnel
1. * List all VCU/VCUHS personnel who are key study personnel.
Key personnel are defined as including:
     - Conflict of interest investigators, including
     - the PI
     - the Lead Student/Trainee Investigator,
     - medically/Psychologically responsible investigator(s)
     - FDA Form 1572 investigators, and
     - Other personnel whose roles are essential to the conduct of the research.
Note: Individuals who are not key personnel are not required to be listed here, but PIs still bear the
responsibility to document the delegation of responsibilities in the study records.
PIs may elect to use the Study Roster activity button in RAMS-IRB (available after approval) as an alternative
way to document study staff involvement and delegation of responsibilities. Personnel changes made to the
non-key personnel listed in the separate Study Roster activity do not require an amendment.

3. If independent investigators or community engaged investigators are listed above, describe the human subjects
training these individuals will complete and the process that will be used to ensure that all persons assisting
with the research are adequately informed about the protocol and their research related duties and functions: 
All persons on the roster will meet at the beginning of the project and maintain quarterly or more contact to discuss
research implementation as needed. All periodic meetings will occur in person or via electronic means and may include
training. All staff will be instructed to contact the PI in the event of an adverse event in multiple means including email,
phone call, and in person meeting as soon as the adverse event is discovered. This study will be carried out at a
community business. The team who delivers the intervention will meet at least weekly to discuss subject success,
strengths, and needs. Agency coordinators or their designees will meet at least monthly. Research data collectors will
meet as needed.
In order to maintain communication between all partners and agencies outside VCU the following team meetings will
occur.
On-site Staff Meetings: The intervention is delivered by a teacher and instructional assistant from Newport News Public
Schools, and by Holly Whittenburg, On-site Coordinator and Thomas Dubois, Job Coach. These individuals meet daily
to discuss on-going implementation issues and plan for the days activities. Issues related to the research participants
and their needs are discussed at this meeting. If there is need for additional support, individual meetings are set up
with the participant and/or their family members.
Coordinating Staff Meetings: Each site engaged in research will designate a person to represent their agency on the
coordinating team. This team is composed of the following individuals:
VCU Site Coordinator
Fort Eustis Business Liaison (Not engaged in research)
Newport News Public Schools Teacher and Transition Coordinator
Hampton City Public Schools Transition Coordinator
York County Public Schools Transition Coordinator
Williamsburg/James City County Transition Coordinator
Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services Representative
This meeting is held monthly on a regular basis. In addition to updating partners on research protocol, this meeting
also allows for future planning and problem solving. We maintain a file of agendas, notes, and discussion during this
meeting.
Due to the nature of the incident report dated 9/18/2018, we will convene a training meeting within 2 weeks of approval
of this amendment to train all staff in the revised consent and screening procedures.
4. * Upload a CV or Biosketch for the PI, Medically/Psychologically Responsible Investigators and the lead
Student/Trainee Investigators. Do not upload CVs or Biosketches for other individuals.

7. * Describe the consent procedures used for this group. Address each point below:
        - When and where consent will occur
        - What will be covered during the consent discussion 
        - How the consent discussion will occur (e.g. in-person, phone, video conference)
        - How you will reconfirm consent on an ongoing basis, if applicable
Because this study involves special education students with ASD, consent meetings will be held concurrently with each
potential participant’s Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meeting at which students and parents/guardians are in
attendance, or during an individual parent/teacher/student conference at the student’s school. At least one member of
the research team will also be available at the meeting to provide information about the study, answer questions, and
obtain informed consent/assent. In the event that a non-English speaking individual participates, we will seek an
interpreter so that the individual can receive the consent information and have their questions answered in their native
language.
COVID-19 Contingency Plan: We will meet with participants via phone or video conferencing only. We will have no in-
person interactions. During this time, we will have two research staff on the phone or video conference. We will mark
the form based upon the verbal consent of the participant. The participant will have up to 2 weeks to make their
decision.
8. * Select the processes for minimizing any potential perception of undue influence to participate, particularly
when there is a pre-existing relationship between the participant and the researcher (e.g. treatment
provider/patient; instructor/student; supervisor/employee, etc.):
Having a 3rd person (family/friends, another study team member, etc.) present during the consent /
assent discussion
Having an independent advocate (e.g. advocate for decisionally impaired adults, wards) present during
the consent / assent discussion
 Removing physical symbols of authority like white coats or police badges
 Sitting down beside the participant instead of standing over them
 If obtaining consent / assent in a clinical setting, letting patients sit instead of lie down (if they are able to)
 Moving to a more neutral location like a conference room
Obtaining consent / assent after other services/interactions have been completed (e.g. after school or
the clinic visit)
 Having a mandatory wait period for the participant to go home and think before they sign consent /assent
Sharing the consent / assent discussion between two people (i.e. a clinician might be the best person to
explain study procedures and risks, but then they could step out and let a research assistant finish the
consent process)
 Other protection(s) not listed here – describe below
 N/A: Requesting Waiver of Consent
9. * Describe the other ways the study team will minimize any potential perception of undue influence to
participate:
Students and/or parents who want additional time to consider participation may take the informed consent documents
with them and will have up to two weeks to consider their decision.
10. * How much time will participants be given to make a decision:
Students and/or parents who want additional time to consider participation may take the informed consent documents
with them and will have up to two weeks to consider their decision.
11. If applicable, describe the procedures for consenting children upon entering adulthood or participants who
are no longer decisionally impaired:
For students who are legally emancipated, we will use a standard consent document; for those who are under the
guardianship of an LAR, we will obtain consent from the LAR and assent from the student.
participants will be made aware of consent form changes pertaining to the certificate of confidentiality and future use of
data, and will have an opportunity to sign the updated consent form when they meet with the researchers.

9. * Describe the other ways the study team will minimize any potential perception of undue influence to
participate:
Study staff will review the consent document and respond to any questions by potential participants in person.
Participants will be asked if they are comfortable signing the document once they have had all of their questions
answered. In the event that participants are not comfortable signing, participants will be offered a copy of the consent
document and allowed to consider whether or not they want to participate in the research. No data will be collected
prior to participant educators signing the document.
10. * How much time will participants be given to make a decision:
We will offer educators 2 weeks to make a decision regarding their participation
11. If applicable, describe the procedures for consenting children upon entering adulthood or participants who
are no longer decisionally impaired:
NA. All Educators are assumed to be competent by virtue of their position as certified educators.
participants will be made aware of consent form changes pertaining to the certificate of confidentiality and future use of
data, and will have an opportunity to sign the updated consent form when they meet with the researchers.

Study Title
Induct ion Study  #2 -A Phase 3, Mult icenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Pl acebo -Controlled 
Study of Oral  Ozanim od as Induct ion Therapy for Moderately to Severely Act ive Crohn’s 
Disease
Indication
Crohn’s disease (CD) is an immune -mediated inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract.  Annual incidence varies geographically, wit h est imates ranging from 3.1 to 14.6 per 
100,000 people in the United States and fro m 0.1 to 16 per 100,000 worldwide ( Lakatos, 2006 ).  
Subjects with CD suffer from diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, abdo minal pain, and fever.  
CDis characterized by a lifelo ng chronic course of remissio ns and exacerbat ions.  The pathology  
of this disease is characterized by transmural i nfiltration of  lymphocy tes and m acrophages, 
granulo mas, fissuring ulcerat ion, and submucosal fibrosis.  The transmural inflammatory process 
of CD predi sposes subjects to the format ion of fistulas and it has been estimated that 
approximately  35% of  subjects will have at least 1fistul a during the course of their disease 
(Schwartz, 2002 ).  In a recent study , within 10 y ears of  diagnosis, 50% of adults with CD had 
undergone bowel surgery  (Peyrin-Biroulet, 2010 ).
The current standard of medical care for patients wit h moderately to severely  active CDconsists 
of anti-inflammatory  approaches, such as corticosteroids, azathioprine (AZA)/6 -mercaptopurine 
(6-MP), methotrexate (MTX), and bio logics such as ant i-tumor necrosi s factor (TNF)α, anti -
interleukin (IL) -12/IL-23,or anti -integrins.
Immunomodulators ai d in corti costeroi d withdrawal  and in preventing relapse, but also are 
associ ated wi th considerable side effects.  Infliximab, an ant i
-TNFα -therapy , is able to reduce 
signs and symptoms and induce and maintain remissio n in the majorit y of subjects for which it is 
indicated.  However, in a large Phase 3 maintenance trial o f infliximab for CD (ACCENT I), 
only 45% of  subjects w ere considered in remissio n at W eek 30 in the highest dose group (where 
remission was defined as the abilit y to achi eve a Crohn’s Disease Act ivity Index [CDAI] of 
<150 points) ( Hanauer, 2002 ).  Similarly, the primary response rates in trials of ada limumab 
(Colombel, 2007 ) and certolizumab ( Sandborn, 2007 ) were approximately 47% and 37%, 
respectively .Thus, a sizable proportion of the patient population is unresponsive to both 
convent ional therapy  and TNF antagoni sts. Vedolizumab, a gut -specific anti- integrin therapy , is 
also indicated for achieving clinical response andclinical remissio n in this population. However, 
in a large clinical tri al of vedo lizumab ,only 32% of subjects had a clinical response at Week 6, 
and only  39% receiving vedolizumab every  8 weeks were in remissio n at Week 52 ( Sandborn, 
2013). Ustekinumab, a monoclonal ant ibody  to the p40 subunit of interleukin -12 and 
interleukin -23, was most recently approved for the treatment of patients who failed or were 
intolerant to treatment with immuno modulators, corti costeroi ds, or 1or more TNF antagonists.
However, in the recent induct ion trials of ustekinumab, only  32% of  subjects were respon ders at 
6 weeks ( Feagan, 2016
),and about 40% were in remissio n at Week 52 of the maintenance trial. 
Therefore, there remains considerable unmet medical need for safe, effect ive, and oral treatments 
forpatients with CD.

Confident ial and Propri etary 7 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: 14 Jun 2021Objectives
Primary object ive:
Demonstrate the efficacy of ozanimod compared to placebo on the induction of 
clinical remissio n 
Secondary  object ives:
Dem onstrate the efficacy of ozanimod compared to placebo on induct ion of clinical 
response, endoscopi c response, endoscopi c remission, and histologic improvement 
Evaluate the efficacy  of ozanim od 
compared to placebo ,in subjects who had 
previously received bio logic therapy  (eg, anti-IL-12, anti -IL-23, anti -TNF, or 
anti-integrin therapy )
Characterize the popula tion pharmacokinet ics (PK) and PK/ pharmacodynamics (PD) 
relationship of ozanim od
Dem onstrate the safet y and tol erabili ty of ozanimo d as induction therapy
Study Design
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to determine the effect of 
oral ozanimod a s an induct iontreatm ent for subjects with moderate lyto severe ly activeCD, 
defined as a CDAI score ≥ 220 to ≤ 450 . Approximately 600subjects with active clinical 
symptoms and mucosal inflammat ion will be randomized in a 2:1 rati o to receive either 
ozanimod 0.92 m g or placebo. Subj ects will be str atified  
. Approximately 50% of subjects with a history  of 
treatm ent wi th marketed biologic agents (eg , TNF antagonists , anti -IL-12/23 and anti-integrin 
therapy )will be recruited. This limit will ensure the enrollment of subjects who have failed or 
been into lerant to corti costeroi ds or immun omodulator sbut never failed a biologic agent . A
futilit y analysis will be conducted when approximately 300 subjects have been enrolled, with a 
similar proportion of bio logicnaïve to bio logicexposed popul ation as that in the overall study  
popul ation. 
 
 
 
The primary  endpoint of the study  is the proporti on of subjects in clinical remissio n (CDAI 
score< 150) at Week 12. Key secondary e ndpoints are presented in Secti on2.

The incidence, severit y, relationship, and t ype of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events ( AEs)leading to discont inuat ion of IP, and AEs of 
special interest (AESIs) will be summarized, as well as clin ically meaningful changes fro m
baseline ,clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, and 
electrocardi ogram s (ECGs).
Statistical Methods
This is a Phase 3, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to expl ore the effect of 
oral ozanimod as an induct ion treatment on clinical remissi on forsubjects with moderately to 
severely  active CD.  The fo llowing analysis populations will be used in the statist ical analysis: 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT):  The ITT analysis population will consist of all randomized 
subjec ts from the Screened analysis populat ion that receive at least 1 dose of IP.  
Subjects in the ITT analysis population will be analyzed according to the randomized 
treatm ent, regardless o f the treatment actually given.  The primary  analysis 
popul ation for all efficacy endpo ints will be the ITT analysis population.
Safety: The safet y analysis populat ion is defined as all subjects who are randomized 
and receive at least one dose of study  treatm ent, analyzed by  actual  treatm ent 
received.

Confident ial and Propri etary 12 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: 14 Jun 2021Per-protocol (PP): The PP popul ation will consist of all subject s in the ITT populat ion
who do not have protocol deviations that may substantially affect the primary  efficacy  
assessment . Thi s populati on will  be used in a sensitivit y analys is of the primary  
endpo int.
Determinat ion of Sample Size for the Primary  Endpoint
The primary  endpoint is CDAI clinical r emissio n at Week 12.  Subjects will be deemed a 
responder wi th respect to this endpo int if they  meet the definit ion for CDAI clinical remissio n at 
Week 12.  This s tudy is designed to have at least a 90% power to correctly  detect a stati stically 
significant difference between placebo and o zanimod with respect to this endpo int.  
Sample size determinat ion was done separately for the two- group chi -square test of equal 
proporti ons wi th 2:1 unbalanced treatment arms.  This yields an overall sample size o f 600 wi th 
the assumption of a t ype I error rate of 5%.  The overall t ype I error rate across all controlled 
endpoints will  be maintained at 5% .
Efficacy Analyses
A futility analysis is planned to be performed when approximately 300 subjects ( with a similar 
proporti on of  biologic naïve to bi ologic exposed subjects as that in the overall study  popul ation) 
from both Induction Studies, collectively , have completed the 12 -week Induction Period . The 
analysis will occur after these subjects have completed the Induction Period and the data have
been cleaned. The primary endpo int, CDAI remissio n (CDAI < 150) at Week 12 be used in the 
analysis. 
 
 
The Induct ion Studi es (RPC01- 3201 and RPC01- 3202) may  be stopped for fut ility 
if the observed treatment effect size in CDAI remissio n is at a low probabilit y to dem onstrate 
superi ority.  Addi tional efficacy endpoints including CDAI response, abdominal pain and stool 
frequency  scores, SES -CD, will be evaluated a s supporting 
analyses. The futilit y boundary  is “non -binding ,” implying that the boundary  can be overruled if 
desired wi thout inflat ing the type -1 error. The “non -binding” boundary is intended to allow the 
Sponsor or the independent Data Monitoring Commi ttee (DMC) to conti nue the study  to gather 
additional information, despi te crossing the fut ility boundary . 
The fut ility analysis will be conducted by  the designated unblinded team (statist ician and 
programmers) that supports the DMC and the results will be sent to the DMC and may also be 
sent to a Cel gene internal review committee (IRC) for review. The Celgene IRC members will 
not pl ay a rol e in the study  conduct, and the blind will be maintained for persons responsible for 
the ongoi ng conduct and manageme nt of the study  through the end of the Maintenance Study 
(RPC01- 3203), until database lock.
For the primary  analysis of remissio n and/or responder endpoints, subjects who have insufficient 
data for remissio n and/or response determinat ion for the timepoint /study  visit under 
consideration will be considered non- responders for that timepo int. Sensit ivity analyses, missing 
data imputation, and continuous endpo int efficacy analys es are discussed in the statistical 
analyt ical plan ( SAP).

Confident ial and Propri etary 21 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: 14 Jun 20211. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Background 
Crohn’s disease (CD) is an immune -mediated inflammatory  disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract.  Annual incidence varies geographically, wit h est imate s ranging from 3.1 to 14.6 per 
100,000 people in the United States and fro m 0.1 to 16 per 100,000 worldwide ( Lakatos, 2006 ).  
Subjects with CD suffer from diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, abdo minal pain, and fever.  
CDis characterized by a lifelo ng chronic course of remissio ns and exacerbat ions.  The pathology  
of this disease is characterized by transmural infiltration of lymphocy tes and m acrophages, 
granulo mas, fissuring ulcerat ion, and submucosal fibrosis.  The tra nsmural inflammatory process 
of CD predi sposes subjects to the format ion of fistulas and it has been estimated that 
approximately  35% of  subjects will have at least 1fistul a during the course of their disease 
(Schwartz, 20 02).  In a recent study , within 10 y ears of  diagnosis, 50% of adults with CD had 
undergone bowel surgery  (Peyrin-Biroulet, 2010 ).
The current standard of medical care for patients wit h moderately to severely  active CD consists 
of anti-inflammatory  approaches, such as corticosteroids, azathioprine (AZA)/6 -mercaptopurine 
(6-MP), methotrexate (MTX), and bio logics such as ant i-tumor necrosi s factor (TNF)α, anti -
interleukin ( IL)-12/IL -23, or anti -integrins.
Immunomodulators ai d in corti costeroi d withdrawal  and in preventing relapse, but also are 
associ ated wi th considerable side effects.  Infliximab, an ant i-TNFα -therapy , is able to reduce 
signs and symptoms and induce and maintain remissio n in the majorit y of subjects for which it is 
indicated.  However, in a large Phase 3 maintenance trial o f infliximab for CD (ACCENT I), 
only 45% of  subjects were considered in remissio n at Week 30 in the highest dose group (where 
remission was defined as the abilit y to achi eve a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] of 
<150 points) ( Hanauer, 2002 ).  Similarly, the primary response rates in trials of adalimumab 
(Colombel, 2007 ) and certolizumab ( Sandb orn, 2007) were approximately  47% and 37%, 
respectively . Thus, a sizable proportion of the patient population is unresponsive to both 
convent ional therapy  and TNF antagoni sts.Vedolizumab, a gut -specific anti- integrin therapy , is 
also indicated for ac hieving clinical response and clinical remissio n in this population. However, 
in a large clinical tri al of vedo lizumab, only 32% of subjects had a clinical response at Week 6, 
and only  39% receiving vedolizumab every  8 weeks were in remissio n at Week 52 ( Sandborn, 
2013). Ustekinumab, a monoclonal ant ibody  to the p40 subunit of interleukin -12 and 
interleukin -23, was m ost recently approved for the treatment of patients who failed or were 
intolerant to treatment with immuno modulators, corti costeroi ds, or 1or more TNF antagonists.
However, in the recent induct ion trials of ustekinumab, only  32% of  subjects were responders at 
6 weeks ( Feagan, 2016
), and about 40% were in remissio n at Week 52 of the maintenance trial. 
Therefore, there remains considerable unmet medical need for safe, effect ive, and oral treatments 
for patients withCD.
1.2. Compound Background 
Ozanimod is a small mo lecule co mpound which select ively binds with high affinit y to 
sphingosine 1- phosphate receptors 1 and 5 . In vitro, ozanimod has little act ivity on the other 
sphingosine -1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, showing half maximal effect ive concentration (EC 50)

extensively  metabo lized in humans with up to 13 metabo lites ident ified in plasma, urine, and 
feces, including 2 active select ive major m etabo lites and 1 inactive major metabo lite found in 
human plasma at steady  state. The 2 active met abolites (CC112273 and CC1084037) have 
similar structures to ozanimod and similar select ivity across the S1P receptor family. 
Many  cell ty pes express S1P1, including vascular endothelial cells, brain cells, and lymphocy tes. 
Stimulation (agonism) of this r eceptor results in biological act ivities that includes lymphocy te 
retenti on in peri pheral lympho id organs ( eg, lymph nodes and GI Peyer’s patches), resulting in 
reversible systemic reduct ion in circulating lymphocy tes (Mand ala, 2002 ). Given the immune -
mediated inflammat ion in CD, prevent ion of circulation of disease -exacerbat ing, self -react ive 
lymphocy tes to the gut is likely to have salutary  immuno modulatory  effects wi th a consequent 
dampening of disease processes.

the invest igational product (IP).
1.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical S tudies
The n onclinical safet y assessment for ozanimod included repeated dose toxicit y (rodent and 
non-rodent), genotoxicit y, carcinogenicit y, reproductive and developmental toxicit y, 
phototoxi city, and immunotoxi cology studies. 
The m ajority of the findings in the chr onic toxi cology studi es, the carcinogenicit y studi es, and 
the reproductive toxico logy studi es are consi dered target m ediated effects of S1P1 and S1P5 
agonists.  These include peripheral blood lymphopenia, lympho id depletion in the splenic 
periarteri olar lympho id sheaths and decreased thymic cortical lymphocytes. The activit y of 
ozanimod and the characterized metabo lites was evaluated in in -vitro and in -vivo pharmaco logy 
assays. Two mouse models of inflammatory  bowel disease, naïve T -cell adopti ve transfer a nd 
2,4,6 -trinitrobenzenesulfo nic acid (TNBS) -induced colit is, demonstrated significant reduction in 
disease severi ty scores as evidenced by colon weight and length measurements, and 
histopathology . Improvement in disease parameters correlated with lymphoc yte count reduction 
with stati stically significant effects observed when lymphocyte counts were decreased by  or 
more.

in Japan (RPC01- 3103), and the global Phase 3 open -label extensio n (RPC01 -3102).
At the conclusio n of the Induction Phase of RPC01 -202, the proportion of subjects achieving 
clinical response and clinical remissio n with ozanim od 0.92 m g was greater than placebo and the

Mayo score, and m ucosal  improvement on endoscopy , were al so posi tive and statist ically 
significant for the ozanimod 0.92 mg dose. The overall AEprofile in the Induct ion and 
Maintenance p eriods appeared com parable between the ozanimod dose groups and placebo, w ith 
no concerning safety  signal observed. 
RPC01 -202 al so had a maintenance phase and an open -label extensio n(OLE) period .Treatment 
with ozanim od 0.92 m g in the OLE peri od dem onstrated efficacy in the endpoints of clinical 
remission, clinical response, histological remissio n, and m ucosal  healing in a substant ial 
proporti on of  subjects .Decreases in part ial Mayo scores and complete May o scores duri ng the 
Induct ion and Maintenance Periodswere maintained throughout th e OLE period. 
Correspondingly, individual Mayo subscores of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician’s 
global assessment score, and endoscopy  showed improvement with ozanimod 0.92 mg treatment 
through outthe OLE period .  
The safet y and tol erabilit y res ults from the UC RPC01- 202 Phase 2 study  suggest that ozanimod 
at doses of 0.46 and 0.92 mg daily for 32 weeks are well tolerated and have an acceptable safet y 
profile in subjects with moderately to severely act ive UC (Sandborn, 2016).
RPC01 -3101, a Phase 3 study  in adult subjects with moderate to severe UC
,met both primary 
endpo ints, demonstrating highly  stati stically significant (p-value < 0.0001) results for induct ion 
of clinical remissio n at Week 10 and in maintenance at Week 52 (Sandborn, 2020). All 3 key 
secondary  endpoints in the Induct ion Peri od (clinical  response, endoscopic improvement, and 
mucosal healing), and all 6 key  secondary  endpoints in the Maintenance Period (clinical 
response, endoscopic improvement, maintenance of remissio n, corticosteroid -free remissio n, 
mucosal healing, and durable clinical remissio n) were achieved by  a statistically  significant ly 
greater proportion of subjects in the ozanimod 0.92 mg treatment grou p compared with placebo. 
The treatment effects for the primary and key secondary endpoints consistent ly supported a 
favorable treatment effect for ozanimod in mult iple dem ographics, pri or and concomitant 
medicat ion, disease characteri stics, and geographic subgroups.
1.2.2.2. Crohn’s Disease
RPC01 -2201, a Phase 2 study, was conducted in CDto examine endoscopic and clinical 
outcom es following treatm ent wi th ozanim od 0.92 mg daily for 12 weeks in the Induct ion Peri od 
and up to 148 weeks in the Extended Period .Simple Endoscopi c Score for Crohn’s Disease 
(SES -CD) reductions of ≥50% f rom baseline were seen in 2 8.6% of  subjects (observed cases) as 
measured by paired segments , with greater endoscopic response in subjects with baseline SES -
CD score ≤12 and a shorter dise ase duration. At Week 52, the proportion of subjects achieving 
reducti ons of ≥ 50% was m aintained at 26.7%. Clinical response was seen in 68.5% and 93.8% 
of subjects (observed cases) at Week 12 and Week 52, respectively. Clinical remissio n was seen 
in 46.3% and 65.6% of subjects (observed cases) at Week 12 and Week 52, respectively.
 
The safet y and tol erabilit y results fro m the 12-week Induction Period of RPC01 -2201 suggest 
that ozanimod 0.92 mg daily is well tolerated and has an accepta ble safet y profile in subjects 
with moderately to severely  active CD. In the open -label period (OLP), ozanimod 0.92 mg was 
well tolerated and there were no new safet y concerns. The AEs reported in the study  were

1.2.3. Rationale for Dose S election
Results fro m single ascending dose and mult iple ascending dose studies in Phase 1 were utilized 
to sel ect appropri ate doses for P hase 2 studies. The Phase 2 study of ozanimod in UC was 
conducted comparing 0.92 mg and 0.46 mg of ozanimod with placebo. Safet y was com parable 
across both ozanimod arms, and the 0.92 mg/day dose arm demonstrated better efficacy as 
compared to the 0.46 m g/day  dose arm  across various clinical and endoscopic endpo ints 
(Sandborn, 2016). Results suggested a dose dependent efficacy response, making 0.92 mg more 
favorable for future invest igation.  
The favorable clinical result s and the available safety  data from  the Phase 2 and Phase 3 UC 
studies,as described above, as well as supportive clinical and safety data fro m the com pleted 
Relapsing Multiple Sclerosi s(RMS) program , provid e addi tional data to support useof the0.92 
mg dose of ozanimod .Data from 52 weeks of treatment (RPC01 -2201) in subjects with active 
CD treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg suggest clinical benefit based on clinical, endoscopic, 
histol ogic  responses ,with a com parable safet y profile to 
subjects previously  evaluated wi th ozanim od. The overall  data support edevaluat ing the 0.92 mg 
dose in the ozanimod CDprogram . 
A dose escalat ion regimen over the first 7 days is being utilized  
 
 
A dose escalat ion start ing 
with 0.23 mg of Ozanim od for the fi rst 4 day s of dosing fo llowed by 0.46 mg on Days 5 
through 7 before progressing to the 0.92 mg/day dose will be used.
Please refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmaco logy, toxi cology, drug m etabolism, clinical studies, and AEprofile o f the IP.
1.2.4. Benefit Risk Assessment
Despite recent progress in CDtreatm ent, there remain s anunmet need for oral agents that are 
safe and convenient and that can provide effective induct ion and l ong term  maintenance of 
clinical remissio n. The benefit risk profile for ozanimod has been evaluated for the indicat ion of 
Crohn’s disease. Results from subjects with moderate to severe disease who previously failed 
prior therapy  and were treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg daily for at least 12 weeks suggested 
clinical and endoscopic benefit. In addition, the safety results suggest that ozanimod is generally 
well tolerated in patients wi th Crohn’s disease and is consistent with that observed in other 
patient popul ations ( UCand RMS ). The overall data to date suggest that this ozanimod Induct ion 
Study (RPC01-3202) has a potenti al favorable benefit risk profile for patients with moderate to

Thesevere acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) global health pandemic has 
been ident ified as a potential risk to clinical trial subjects in general and may  parti cularly  affect 
patients wi th underlying chronic disease. It is not known if taking ozanimod increases the risk of 
SARS -CoV -2 infect ion, or the duration or severit y of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). 
The individual benefit risk considerat ions remain the responsibilit y of the Invest igator. 
Invest igators should apply clinical judgment and these risks should be considered when enrolling 
a subject.
The exclusio n criteria (Secti on4.3) have been designed to exclude people wit h current and 
recent infections. Testing to exclude asymptomat ic SARS -CoV -2 prior to enrollment should 
follow local practice.
The study  has been designed with study  visits that all ow for close m onitoring of subjects’ safet y 
throughout the clinical trial (Table 1),and subjects are encouraged to contact the invest igator if 
an intercurrent illness de velops between study  visits. Testi ng for COVID -19 to i nform  decisi ons 
about clinical care during the study  shoul d follow local  standard practice. 
Evaluat ion and management of SARS -CoV -2 infections arising during the course of the trial are 
left to the dis cretion and expertise of the Invest igator. For subjects who are exhibit ing symptom s 
consistent with SARS-CoV -
2, the Sponsor advises the Invest igator to consider holding dosing of 
investigat ional product and to consult the Medical Monitor . 
Non-live COVID -19 vaccinat ion is considered a simple conco mitant m edicat ion within the 
study . However, the efficacy and safet y of non-
live vaccines (including non- live COVID -19 
vaccines) in subjects receiving Ozanimod is unknown. The individual benefit risk assessm ent of 
a vaccine remains with the Invest igator . If the assessment of the Invest igator suggests the 
vaccine to be beneficial, it must be a non -live, replicat ion incompetent vaccine, and be approved 
or authori zed (i e,Emergency  Use Authori zation [FDA ]or equ ivalent) by national healt h 
authori ties.
1.3. Study Rationale
Given the mechanism o f action of ozanimod, data fro m the preclinical animal model, the posi tive 
resul ts from the Phase 2 (RPC01 -202) and Phase 3 (RPC01 -3101) UC studies , and preliminary 
resul ts from the Induct ion Peri od of the Phase 2 study in CD (RPC01 -2201) , a Phase 3 program
with ozanim od in CD is being init iated.
The current study is designed as a doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled study to assess the efficacy  
and safet y of ozanim od in induc ing clinical remission and response in subject s with moderately  
to severely act ive CD. 
Primary efficacy assessment of ozanimod 0.92 m gper day  will be asses sedat Week 12 based on 
the efficacy  results seen in the RPC01 -2201 study after 12 weeks of treatment w ith ozanimod

3.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to expl ore the effect of 
oral ozanimod as an induct ion treatment for subjects with moderately to severe ly active CD , 
defined as a CDAI score ≥ 220 to ≤ 450 . Approximately 600subjects wi th active clinical 
symptoms and mucosal inflammat ion will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 
ozanimod 0.92 m g or placebo.  Subj ects will be stratified  
. Amaximum o f approximately 50% of  subjects wi th a 
history  of treatm ent wi th marketed biologic agents (eg, TNF antagonists, anti- IL-12/23 ,and ant i-
integrin therapy) will be recruited. This limit will ensure the enrollment of subjects who have 
failed or been intolerant to corticosteroids or immu nodulators but never failed a biologic agent .  
The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects in clinical remissio n (CDAI 
score< 150) at Week 12. Key secondary endpo ints are provided in Sect ion 2.A fut ility analysis 
will be conducted w henapproximately 300 subjects have been enrolled, withasimilar 
proporti on of  biological  naïve to bio logical exposed population as thatin the overall study  
popul ation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Subjects who received 
placebo and are in clinical response ,
clinical remission, and/or have anaverage daily  stool  
frequency  score ≤ 3 and an average abdo minal pain score ≤ 1 with abdo minal pain and stool 
frequency  no worse than baseline at the end of this study will cont inue to receive placebo in a 
blinded fashio n in the Maintenance Study .  Those subj ects not meet ing the criteria outlined 
above at the end of the Induct ion Study will be eligible to enter the OLE Study (RPC01 -3204).
Subjects receiving any  medical or surgi cal intervent ion for the treatment of CD that meet the 
criteria for treatment failure ( Secti on9.8) will be discontinued fro m the study  and will  not be 
eligible for the Maintenance or OLE Studies.
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th Internati onal Council on Harm onisat ion (ICH) 
of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceut icals for Hum an Use/Good Clinical 
Practi ce (GCP ) and applicable regulatory  requi rements.

endoscopi c evi dence and corroborated by  a histol ogy report. (Note: endoscopy  and local 
histopathology  confirmat ion may be obtained during Screening if no pr ior report is 
readily  available ).
4.Subject has met each of the fo llowing 2 criteria:
a CDAI score ≥ 220 and ≤ 450
an average daily  stool  frequency ≥ 4 poi nts and/or an abdo minal pain of ≥2 points
5.Subject has a SES-CD score of ≥ 6 (or SES -CD ≥ 4 in subjects with iso lated ileal 
disease ).
6. Subject has an inadequate response or loss of response to or is intolerant of at least 1of 
the following systemic CD treatm ents (see Appendix B for addi tional details):
corticosteroi ds 
immuno modulators 
biolo gic therap ies(eg, ustekinumab, TNFα antagonists, or vedolizumab)
7.If the subject is taking t he following background therapies for CD, a stable dose must be 
maintained throughout the study  beginning from  the screening period as indicated below :

part of the colonoscopy  performed during Screening.  Any  visualized adenom atous 
polyps must be removed and any suspicious lesio n confirmed free of cancer and /or
dysplasia prior to rando mization.
9. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) :
Note: For the purposes of this study , a female subject is considered to be of childbearing 
potenti al if 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy  (the surgical  removal of the uterus) or 
bilateral  oopho rectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been 
postm enopausal for at l east 24 consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any  time 
during the preceding 24 consecutive months). Must agree to practice a highly  effect ive 
method of contra cepti on throughout the study  until completion o f the  
. Highly effect ive methods of contraception are those that alone or in 
combinat ion resul t in a failure rate of a Pearl I ndex of less than 1% per y ear when used 
consistent ly and correctly .Examples of a cceptable methods of birth control in the study  
are the fo llowing:
combined hormonal ( containing oestrogen and progestogen ) contraception, which 
may be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal 
progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation, 
which may  be oral , injectable, or implantable
placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)
placement of an intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)
bilateral  tubal  occl usion
vasectomi zed partner
complete sexual abst inence
Periodic abst inence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), wi thdrawal  
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only , and lactati onal amenorrhoea m ethod are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.
Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potenti al risks of fetal  exposure m ust be 
conducted for FCBP . The Investigator will educate all FCBP about the different options 
of contraceptive methods or abstinence at Screening and Day  1, as appropri ate. The 
subject will be re -educated every  time her c ontraceptive measures/methods or abilit y to 
beco me pregnant changes. The female subject’s chosen form of contraception must be 
effect ive by the time the female subject is randomized into the study (for example, 
horm onal contracepti on shoul d be ini tiated at least 28 day s before randomizat ion).
10.Subject must have documentation of posit ive varicella zoster virus (VZV) 
or com plete VZV vaccination at least 30 days 
prior to randomizat ion.See Secti on11.3.

components: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowing.  Each 
of these com ponents are scored on a scale of 0 to 3 as outlined in Table 5.  
In the SES -CD, each of these 4 components are assessed in the 5segm ents of the ileum and 
colon:  ileum , right, transverse, l eft (descending and si gmoid), and rectum .  The SES -CD is the 
sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the 5segm ents.

There i s no provi sion for dose adj ustments in this study .  Subj ects who cannot tol erate IPmust be 
withdrawn from  the study .
7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
Following the 7 -day dose escalat ion, subjects will receive a single 0.92 mg oral dose of 
ozanimod (equivalent to ozanimod HCl 1 mg) or matching placebo admin istered daily .The dose 
escalat ion regime is as fo llows:
Day 1 through 4: Ozanimod 0.23 mg (equivalent to ozanimod HCl 0.25 mg) (or 
matched placebo)
Day 5 through 7: Ozanimod 0.46 mg daily  (equivalent to ozanimod HCl 0.5 mg) 
(administered as two 0.23
-mg capsules or 2 matched placeb o capsules)
Day 8 through Week 12: Ozanimod 0.92 mg daily  (equivalent to ozanimod HCl 1 
mg) (or m atched placebo)
 
 
If subject s miss dosing for morethan 14 days ,they are required to com plete the 7-day dose 
escalat ion regimen as outlined above, including .  
Anoverdose is any  dose of IP given to a subject or taken by a subject that exceeds the dose 
described in the protocol. Any  overdose, wi th or wit hout associated AEs, must be prompt ly 
reported to the Medical Monitor or other designated Drug Safety  Center. Theoverdose shoul d be 
recorded in the study  exposure eCRF. AEs associated with anoverdose shoul d be reported on

IPshould not be used for purposes other than as defined in this protocol.
All supplies of IPwill be accounted for in accordance wit h GCP.  There will be an individual IP
accountabilit y record for each subject ,and the Investigator should mainta in accurate records of 
the disposit ion of all IPsupplies received during the study .  These records should include the 
amounts and dates that the clinical drug supplies were received, dispensed to the subject , 
returned by the subject ,and returned to the Sponsor .  If errors or damages in the clinical drug 
supply shipments occur, the Invest igator should contact the Clinical Monitor immediately.  Each 
Invest igator will provide copies o f the IPaccountabilit y records for inclusio n in the Trial Master 
File aft er database lock.  The Clinical Monitor will periodically check the supplies of IP held by 
the Invest igator or pharm acist to verify  accountabili ty of all IPused.
The Investi gator will provide the IPonly to the i dentified subject s of this study , according to the 
procedures described in this study protocol .  After the end of the study , the Clinical Monitor will 
perform  final accountabilit y, package, seal , and prepare for shipment.  IPand all medication 
containers will be returned to the clinical supply dis tribut ion vendor and documentation will be 
returned to the C linical Research Organizati on.  The CRO will verify  that a final  report of IP
accountabilit y is prepared and maintained in the Investi gator ’s Trial Center File.
The Sponsor (or designee) will revi ew wi th the Investi gator and relevant site personnel the 
process for IPreturn, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilit ies for the si te versus
Sponsor (or designee).
7.6. Investigational Product Compliance
It is the Invest igator’s responsibilit y to ensure that subject s are correctly instructed on how to 
take thei r IP, and that each subject is fully com pliant wi th his/her assigned dosage regimen.  
Records of IPused atintervals between visits will be kept during the study .  Drug accountabilit y 
will be noted by  the Clinical Monitor during site visits and at the complet ion of the study .  
Subject s will be asked to return all unused IPat the end of the study .  The IPshould be dispensed 
by the Invest igator , or by  a qualified individu al under the Invest igator ’s supervisio n.  
Overall study nonco mpliance i s defined as taking less than 80% or more than 120% of IPduring 
the ent ire treatm ent peri od.
At each visit, previously  dispensed IPcapsules will be collected by  the Invest igator , or by a 
qualified individual under the Investigator ’s supervisio n, and co mpliance assessed.  Subject s 
exhibit ing poor com pliance (ie, 2 or m ore missed medicat ion days in 1 week) as assessed by 
medicat ion counts and their response to a medicat ion compliance qu estion at each visit should be 
counseled on the importance of good compliance to the study dosing regimen.  Subject s who are 
persistently nonco mpliant (<80% or > 120%) shoul d be di scussed wi th the Medical Monitor to 
determine whether they  shoul d be wi thdrawn from the study .

Confident ial and Propri etary 59 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: 14 Jun 20218. CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS AND PROCEDURES
All treatments, other than ozanimod, being taken by the subjects on entry  to the study  or at any  
time during the study , including through the , are regarded as 
concomitant medicat ions and must be documented on the appropriate section of the eCRF. A 
complete history  of all previ ous treatm ents f or CD must be documented. All diagnostic, 
therapeuti c, or surgi cal procedures and/or past biologic exposure relat ing to CD should be 
recorded. Histories o f all other prior medications taken during the 30 days pri or to the date of 
inform ed consent, m ust also be docum ented. 
Administrati on of  concomi tant m edicat ions m ust be reported al ong wi th dosage inform ation, 
dates of admin istrati on, and reasons for use. For medicat ions wi th a single active ingredient, 
generic names for concomitant medications shoul d be used if possible. For combinat ion 
products, brand names should be used. The total daily dose should be filled in whenever 
possible.
8.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Any medicat ion that i s considered necessary  for the subject ’s healt h and that i s not expected to 
interfere wi th the evaluat ion of or interact with IPmay be continued during the study .
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.1.1. Cortico steroid s
During the Induction Study , 
subject s are to maintain thei r stable baseline corticosteroid dose, if 
applicable.  Corticosteroids may be tap ered starting after com pletion of  the Induction S tudy at 
Week 12for subject s after entering either the M ainte nance S tudy or the OLE Study.  Please see 
protocol s RPC01 -3203 and RPC01-3204 for details on the tapering regimen in these studies.  
8.1.2. Aminosalicyl ates and Purified Medicinal Probiotics

Detailed methodology  for summary  and stati stical analyses o f the data collected in this study  will 
be docum ented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the Sponsor . 
The SAP may  modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major m odificat ions of the 
primary  endpoint definit ion and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1. Overview
This is a mult icenter, double -blind, rando mized, Phase 3, placebo -controlled study  to determine 
the effect of oral ozani mod as induct ion therapy  on clinical remissi on in subjects with 
moderately  to severely act ive CD. Approximately 600 subjects with act ive clinical symptoms 
and mucosal inflammat ion will be rando mized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ozanimod 0.92 m g 
or placebo. Subj ects will be stratified  
.  
Interactive response t echno logy (IRT) will be utilized to ensure a central rando mizat ion based on 
a stratified block rando mizat ion.See Secti on9.3.4 for more details. An independent Data 
Moni toring Committee (DMC) will be used to monitor the study  conduct.
9.2. Study Population Definitions
The fo llowing analysis populat ions will be used in the statist ical analysis: 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT): The ITT analysis populat ion will consist of all randomized 
subjects fro m the Screened analysis populat ion receiving at least 1dose of IP.  
Subjects in the ITT analy sis popul ation will  be analyzed according to the randomized 
treatm ent, regardless o f the treatment actually given. The primary  analysis populati on 
for all efficacy endpoints will be the ITT analysis populat ion.
Safety: The safet y analysis populat ion is defined as all subjects who are randomized 
and receive at least one dose of study  treatm ent, analyzed by  actual  treatm ent 
received.
Per-protocol (PP): The PP populat ion will consist of all subject s in the ITT populat ion 
who do not have protocol deviations th at may substanti ally affect the primary  efficacy  
assessment . Thi s populati on will  be used in a sensitivit y analys is of the primary  
endpo int.
Addit ional analysis populat ions are defined and their use described in the SAP.
9.3. Sample Size and Power Consideration s
9.3.1. Primary Endpoint 
The primary  endpoint is CDAI clinical r emissio n at Week 12.  Subjects will be deemed 
responder swith respect to thi s endpo int if the y meet the definit ion for CDAI clinical r emissi on at 
Week 12.  Reject ion of the null hypothesis associated with the primary endpoint will lead to the 
concl usion that the proportion of Week 12 CDAI clinical r emissi on responders in the ozanimod 
arm is statist ically significant ly different from the proporti on of  Week 12 CD AI clinical 
remission responders in the placebo arm.

Confident ial and Propri etary 64 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: 14 Jun 20219.3.2. Placebo Response Rates for the Primary Endpoint 
The Week 12 placebo response rate(s) were developed fro m a literature search ( Jairath, 2017 ; 
Verm eire, 201 6; Sandborn, 2013 ).  The Week 12 ozanimod response rate for the primary 
endpo int was derived fro m data obtained from Protocol RPC01 -2201 (see Secti on1.2.2
for a summary  of the RPC01- 2201 study ).  Table 9summarizes this informat ion:

Confident ial and Propri etary 65 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: 14 Jun 2021It is often true that response rates in rando mized blinded studies are smaller than in open -label 
studi es.  To provide a conservat ive sam ple size est imate, the assumed o zanimod and placebo 
rates for endoscopic r esponse are therefore  and  respectively.  This yields the 
following sam ple size calculat ions:
In order to provide at least  power to detect a differe nce of at l east  between the 
ozanimod and pl acebo arm s with respect to the endoscopic r esponse en dpoints ( proportion of 
subjects wi th  at Week 12 and proporti on of  subjects 
with CDAI reducti on from baseline of ≥ 100 points  
 at Week 12 ), the data from RPC01 -3201 and RPC01 -3202 will be 
pooled for those endpoints
Addit ional power and sample size details regarding the endoscopi c response major s econdary  
endpo ints, as well as a discussio n around the power ass ociated wi th the collect ion of primary and 
major s econdary  endpo ints, are provi ded in the SAP.
Note: The overall type I error rate across all controlled endpo ints will be maintained at 5% using 
methods di scussed in Secti on9.6.3 .
9.3.4. Stratified Block Randomization
Subjects enro lled in this p rotocol  will be rando mized using s tratified block rando mizat ion in 
order to account for the study  design.  Subjects will be stratifi ed  
 and then rando mized to either ozanimod 0.92 m gor placebo in a 
2:1 allo cation rati o.  
9.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Descript ive summaries will be presented for all co llected baseline and demographic information. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviat ion 
(SD), m edian, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using 
frequency  counts and percentages.
Baseli ne characteri stics subject demographics will include, at minimum, age, sex, race, ethnicit y, 
height, weight, b ody mass index, age at CD symptom onset, age at CD diagnosis, y ears since CD 
symptom  onset, y ears since CD di agnosis, baseline CDAI score, baselin e SES-CD score,

Subject di sposi tion will be based on the following:
number of subjects screened
number of subjects rando mized
number o f subjects dosed
number of subjects completing the Induction Study
number of subjects not complet ing the Induct ion Study by reason for dropout 
number of subjects entering the OLE Study

9.6. Efficacy Analysis
Because all primary  and secondary  endpoints for this study  are ei ther remi ssion or responder 
endpo ints (ie, proporti ons of subjects meeting the criteria to be classified as remitters or 
responders for the 2 treatm ent groups), the analysis of endpo ints using a continuous measure will 
not be described here, but rather discussed in the SAP. For the primary analysis of remissio n or 
responder endpo ints, the ITT analysis populat ion will be used. Furthermore, for the primary 
analysis of remissio n or responder endpoi nts and for a given time point or study  visit, ITT 
subjects who have insufficient data for remissio n or response determinat ion will be considered 
non-remitters/non -responders for that time point or study  visit. Sensi tivity analyses , missing data 
imputati on and cont inuous endpo int efficacy analyses are di scussed in the SAP.
9.6.1. Futility Analysis
A futility analysis isplanned to be performed when approximately 300 subjects ( with a similar 
proporti on of  biologic naïve to bi ologic exposed subjects as that in the overall study  popul ation) 
from both Induction studies, collect ively, have completed the 12 -week Induction Period . The 
analysis will occur after these subjects have completed the Induction Period and the data have 
been cleaned. The primary endpo int, CDAI remissio n (CDAI < 150) at Week 12 will be used in 
the analysis. 
 
 The Inducti on studi es (RPC01 -3201 and RPC01 -
3202) m ay be stopped for fut ility if the observed treatment effect size in CDAI remissio n is at a 
low probabilit y to dem onstrate superi ority. Addi tional efficacy  endpoints including CDAI 
response, abdo minal pain and stool frequency scores, SES- CD,  will be evaluated as 
supporting analyses. The futilit y boundary  is “non -binding ,” implying that the boundary  can be 
overruled if desired wit hout inflat ing the ty pe-1 error. The “non -binding” boundary is intended to 
allow the Sponsor or the indepe ndent DMC to continue the study  to gather addi tional 
inform ation, despite crossing the fut ility boundary . 
The fut ility analysis will be conducted by  the designated unblinded team (statist ician and 
programmers) that supports the DMC and the results will be sent to the DMC for revi ew, and

responsible for the ongoing conduct a nd m anagement of the study  through the end of the 
Maintenance Study  (RPC01- 3203), until database lock.
9.6.2. Analysis of Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints
The primary  analysis of the primary  and key  secondary  endpoints wi th binary  measure (ie, 
yes/no) such as clinical remissio n and clinic al response at Week 12 will be each carried out using 
the Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) method. The stratifying factors of  
 will be accounted for in the CMH analyses.  
Details regarding risk differences, odds ratios, confidence limits, and considerations for 
sensit ivity analyses will be provided in the separate SAP. 
The primary analysis of the primary  and key  secondary  endpoints will be performed wit h the 
missing data imputed using non -responder imputatio n (NRI) method. Sensit ivity analyses will 
also be performed using other missing data handling rules.
9.6.3. Control of Family -Wise Type I Error Rate and Data Pooling
The primary  endpoint and m ajor secondary  endpoints of this study  (RPC01 -3202) will be tested 
statist ically using a closed, hi erarchical testing procedure i n order to control the overall t ype I 
error rate for mult iple endpo intsin the current study .  
In par allel, this procedure i s also applied to 
RPC01 -3202 tri al.
If an endpo int in this pre -specified hierarchy fails to reach statist ical si gnificance, all subsequent 
major s econdary  endpoints will  be con sidered exploratory .  Only  the primary and m ajor 
secondar y endpo ints will have t ype I error rates controlled at the f amily -wise l evel.  All  other 
endpo ints will be tested at a nominal α=0.05 level.
9.7. Safety Analysis
All safet y analysis will be carried out on the Safet y Populat ion.  No inferent ial testing for 
statistical significance isplanned. 
All safet y data will be listed and summarized by t reatment group as appropriate. All TEAEs will 
be coded and tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.  The incidence o f AEs, SAEs, 
and AEs leading to discont inuat ion will be summarized and presented in descending order of 
frequency .  Associated l aboratory  param eters such as hepatic enzymes, renal funct ion, and 
hematol ogy values will be grouped and presented together.  Individual subject values will be 
listed and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged.  Shift table s and 
analyses o f changes fro m baseline will be produced.  The change fro m baseline  
, each of the vital signs and ECG parameters w ill be summarized.  The 
incidence of abnormal vital signs parameters and outlier ECG results will be tabulated. AEs will

10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any  noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appea r or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury , or any  concomi tant impai rment of  the subject’s healt h, including 
laboratory  test val ues (as specified by  the cri teria in Secti on11), regardl ess of et io logy. Any  
worsening (ie, any  clinically significant adverse change in the frequency  or intensi ty of a 
preexist ing condi tion) shoul d be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded 
on the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndro me.
CDrelapse and related symptoms will be monitored as study endpo ints.These occurrences will 
not be recorded as AEs unless they are new or worse than baseline or if they meet the criteria for 
seriousness .
Reductions in ALC levels for subject s in this study arean expected primary effect. 
Reductions in ALC, in general, ne ed not be reported as AEs unless there are clinical 
consequences. The protocol requirements in Secti on11shoul d be f ollowed for confirmed  
. The decisio n to report decreased ALC as an AE is at the Invest igator ’s discretion.
In order to facilitate reporting of SARS -CoV -2 events that occur during the study , all AEs and 
SAEs related to SARS CoV -2 should be reported from the time o f consent until the final study  
visit.
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condit ion/illness lea ding to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as all noxious and unintended responses to a 
medicinal product related to any  dose (ICH E2A, II.A.2).
An unexpected ADR is defined as an adverse reactio n, the nature of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product informat ion (ICH E2A, II.A.3).
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severit y, seriousness and causal relat ionship to the IP.  
The action taken and the outcome mus t also be recorded.
Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity or toxi city to an IPshoul d be reported as an AE. Overdose, 
accidental  or intent ional, that are associated with an AE should be reported on the eCRF. See 
Secti on10.1.1 for the definit ion of overdose. Any sequela of an accidental or intent ional 
overdose of an IPshoul d be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of an overdose is 
an SAE, then t he sequela must be reported as an SAE on the AE eCRF .The overdose result ing 
in the SAE should be ident ified as the cause of the event on the SAE Report Form and eCRF but 
shoul d not be reported as an SAE itself.
10.1.1. Treatment of Overdose of Investigational Product
An overdose is any  dose of IPgiven to a subject or taken by a subject that exceeds the dose 
described in the protocol. Any  overdose, wi th or wit hout associated AEs, must be prompt ly 
reported to the CRO’s Medical Monitor or other designated Drug Sa fety Center . The overdose

reported on relevant AE/SAE sections in the eCRF.
10.1.2. Monitoring of Subject s with Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events
Invest igators must caref ully m onitor each subject for AEs.  This includes clinical laboratory  
variables. Assessments must be made of the seriousness, severit y, and rel ationship to the 
administration of the IP.  After the init ial AE/SAE report, the Invest igator is required to fo llow 
up proactively with each subject and provide further information to the Sponsor’s Drug Safet y or 
designee on the subject’s condit ion.  During the study , all AE/SAEs shoul d be fo llowed up to 
resol ution unless the event is considered by the Investi gator to be unlikely to resolve due to the 
subject’s underlying disease, or the subject is lost to fo llow-up. Safet y reporting m ust com ply 
with ICH E6, 4.11.
All AEs will be recorded by  the Investi gator from the time the subject signs informed consent 
until as well as 
those SAEs made known to the Invest igator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being 
related to IP.  All SAEs that occur , 
whether or not considered related to the IP, must also be reported.  AEs and SAEs will be 
recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents.  Refer to 
Secti on13for instructions on how to report SAE sto Drug Safet y.
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Invest igator will evaluate all AEs based on seriousness, severit y, causalit y, durati on, 
action taken, and outcom e. 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (ICH E2A, 
II.B):
results in death
is life -threatening
NOTE: The term  “life-threatening” in the definit ion of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypotheti cally  might have caused death if it were more severe.
requires inpatient hospitalizat ion or prol ongati on of  exist ing hospi talizati on
results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital abnormalit y/birth defect

Serology testing will be performed at Screening to determine the subject’s immune status with 
respect to the fo llowing viral infect ions: 
VZV 
A VZV t iter will be performed to determine if the subject has immunit y (posi tive 
IgG result to varicella zoster vi rus). If the ti ter is negative, and there are no 
antibodies detected against VZV, the subject should therefore be offered to 
receive VZV vaccination. If the subject receives a VZV vaccinat ion, 
rando mizat ion can only occur at a minimum o f 30days after vacci nation has been 
completed. Note: Should the treating physician decide to vaccinate, t he Sponsor

Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicio n that an IPmay have 
interfered wi th the effectiveness of a contraceptive medicat ion; however, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, normal bir th, or congeni tal 
abnorm ality) must be foll owed up and docum ented even if the subject was discont inued from the 
study .  In cases of live birth, with the consent of a parent, the infant may be followed f or up to a 
year.
All reports of congenital abnormalit ies/bi rth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elect ive abortions without complicat ions should not be 
handled as AEs. All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to Sponsor’s Drug Safet y or 
designee .
12.1. Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential
Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be 
conducted for female subjects of childbearing potent ial(FCBP) .  The Invest igator will educate 
all FCBP about the different options of contraceptive methods or abstinence at Screening and 
Day 1, as appropriate. The subject will be re -educated every  time her contraceptive 
measures/methods or abilit y to becom e pregnant changes.  The female subject ’s chosen form  of 
contraception must be effective by the time the female subject is rando mized into the study  (for 
example, hormonal contraception should be init iated at least 28 day s before rando mizat ion).
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-hCG or posi tive pregnancy tes t in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is 
on IP ,  are considered immediately  
reportable events.  IPis to be discont inued immediatel y and the subject instructed to return any 
unused porti on of  the IP to the Invest igator . The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy , or posi tive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Sponsor ’sDrug Safet y or desi gnee immediately using the 
Pregnancy Init ial Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
The Investi gator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy , and m ust 
notify Sponsor ’s Drug Safet y or desi gnee immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy 
(either normal  or abnorm al outcom e) usi ng the Pregnancy Fo llow-up Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Invest igator
shoul d report the abnorm al outcom e as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any  of the seri ous 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Sponsor ’sDrug Safet y or desi gnee within 24 hours of 
the Invest igator ’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form.
All neonatal  deaths that occur within  of birth should be reported, wi thout regard to 
causalit y, as SAEs.  In addit ion, any infant death after  that the Invest igator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Sponsor’s Drug Safety or 
designee within 24 hours of the Invest igator ’s knowledge o f the event using the SAE Report 
Form , or approved equivalent form .

Reporting requirements for SAEs will be managed on behalf o f the Sponsor by Sponsor’s Drug 
Safety or desi gnee.  Full details of the procedures to be adopted will be documented in a safet y 
management plan approved by responsible parties, in brief:
The Investi gator will report any  SAE that occurs to any  subject from the t ime written informed 
consent is signed through the last visit.   All SAEs that occur  
, whether or not considered related to the IP, must also be reported.  
Any SAE that is ongo ing when the subje ctcompletes the study or discont inues from the study
will be fo llowed by the Investi gator until the event has reso lved, stabilized, or returned to 
baseline status.
Any AE considered serious by the Invest igator or Sub- Invest igator or that meets serious cri teria 
shoul d be reported to the Sponsor’s Drug Safet y or desi gnee using the designated SAE reporting 
forms and procedures.  Data entry  must be com pleted wi thin 24 hours from the time the study
site personnel first l earned of the event.
The SAE contact information is as follows:
For Celgene Drug Safety contact information, please refer to the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form Completion Guidelines or to the Pregnancy Report Form Completion 
Guidelines.
The init ial report should be prompt ly followed by  detailed, written reports, which will include 
copies of  hospi tal case records, di scharge summaries, autopsy  reports, and other documents 
when requested and applicable. For unrelated cases, a full detailed case description may negate 
the need for addit ional hospi tal case records, di scharge summaries, etc.
Invest igators will be notified by the Sponsor’s Drug Safet y or desi gnee of  all SAEs that require 
prom pt submissio n to thei r IRB or IEC.  Invest igators should provide written documentation of 
IRB/IEC notifi cation for each report to the CRO. The CRO will ensure that all SAEs are reported

15.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study  unless in the opinio n of the 
Invest igator , it is absol utely necessary  to safely treat the subje ct.  If i t is m edically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discont inued if, in the opinio n of 
the Invest igator , con tinuing IP can negat ively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment.
The decisio n to break t he blind in emergency situations remains the responsibilit y of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor .  However, the Invest igator may 
contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the 
interest of the subject. 
The Investi gator shoul d ensure that the code is broken only  in accordance wit h the protocol. The 
Invest igator shoul d prom ptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency  unblinding and the 
reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Invest igator in the 
subject’s source documentation.
Emergency  unblinding shoul d only  be perf ormed by  the Invest igator through the IRT by using an 
emergency unblinding person al ident ification number (PIN). T he Investigator should log into 
IRT for unblinded dose information.

study , a Sponsor representative will review the protocol, eCRFs, procedures for obtaining 
inform ed consent, record keeping, and reporting of A Es/SAEs wit h the Invest igator . Mo nitoring 
details describing strategy , including definit ion of study crit ical data items and processes (eg, 
risk-based init iatives in operations and qualit y such as risk management and mit igation strategi es 
and analy tical risk-based monitoring), methods, responsibilit ies, and requirements, including 
handling of nonco mpliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on -site 
monitoring) are provided in the monitoring plan.
Accuracy  will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that i s a di rect com parison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any result ing 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investi gator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corre ctions will be made direct ly to the eCRFs or via queries by the Invest igator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusion 
criteria and docum entati on of  SAEs and their proper recording be verif ied.  Addi tional

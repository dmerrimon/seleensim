 1. Objective  
Our objective is to determine the effectiveness of varied outreach methods (e.g. automated reminder calls/text 
messages with or without personalized calls/texts, MyChart messaging) to children age 12 -14 months, 4 years old, 
or 6-17 years old who are due for a WCC visit and don’t have one s cheduled in the next 45 days on the outcomes of 
appointment scheduling, appointment completion, and receipt of the MMR vaccination.  
 
Background  
The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Primary Care offices serve as the medical home for over 33,000  
children.  The Pediatric Primary Care Center (PPCC), Hopple Street Health Center (HPC) and Fairfield Primary 
Care (FPC) serves an underserved population.  Annually, these practices provide over 60,000 visits.  Traditional 
outreach efforts in these offices  have included reminder phone calls and/or texts when patients were overdue for 
well child care (WCC).  These efforts were time and resource intensive, as they required personnel to manually 
complete and document attempts. Additionally, due to high resourc e needs to accomplish such efforts, there has 
been no outreach to those 6 years and older.  
 
Numerous studies exist speaking to the efficacy of automated reminder (i.e. notifying parents of needed 
immunizations) and recall (i.e. notifying parents of overdue  immunizations) systems, including text messaging 
systems.1,2,3  Other studies show that the combination of texting and calls proves even more successful in reaching 
patients.3 These systems are more cost effective and efficient.  Differences in the timing of reminders to schedule, as 
well as the message itself, has been shown to make a difference in the outcomes of reaching patients or scheduling 
appointments.4 However, there remains a need for research that identifies the degree to which combinations of 
patient reminder systems improve outcomes, especially the outcome of on -time immunization, and how these  
approaches differ by age of child.1 
 
Following the COVID -19 pandemic shut -down in which thousands of well child appointments were cancelled or 
delayed, the importance of a systematic outreach process became more critical.  The traditional process is non -
standardized and the efficacy of the work is both unknown and expensive.  Our objective is to determine the 
effectiveness of varied outreach methods (e.g. automated reminder calls/text messages with or without personalized 
calls/texts, MyChart messaging) to  children age 12 -14 months, 4 years old, or 6 -17 years old who are due for a 
WCC visit and don’t have one scheduled in the next 45 days on the outcomes of appointment scheduling, 
appointment completion, and receipt of the MMR vaccination.  
2. Design/Method  
To achieve our objective, we will conduct a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial.  Randomization is justified 
because 1) it is a rigorous approach to answer our question and 2) we do not have the resources or appointment 
availability t o personally contact every patient who is eligible and have them schedule immediately.  
 
Patient Population :  
Patients are eligible for inclusion in this study if they are in one of four eligible groups:  
12-14 months AND  4 years AND  
• doesn’t have a well vis it scheduled 
in the next 45 days  
• have not yet received 12 -month 
immunizations  
• have English and/or Spanish as 
preferred language  • doesn’t have a well visit scheduled 
in the next 45 days  
• has not had a well child visit in 365 
days 
• have English and/or Spanish a s 
preferred language  
 
6-11 years AND  12-17 years AND  
• doesn’t have a well visit scheduled 
in the next 45 days  • doesn’t have a well visit scheduled 
in the next 45 days

Televox (age 6 -11yo) Trial :  
Patients will be randomized into the following three groups.  Patients with MyChart are excluded:  
no message   Low tailored Message  
2 automated standard 
messages sent (e.g. 
Thu, Fri)  High Tailored

Televox (age 12 -17yo) Trial :  
Patients will be randomized into the following three groups:  
no message  Low Tailored Message  
2 automated tailored 
messages sent (e.g. 
Thu, Fri)  COVID Tailored 
Message  
2 automated messages

Automated Message : Parents indicate their preferred mode of reminder (e.g. call or text message) when they 
schedule appointments.  Cincinnati Children’s uses a HIPAA compliant platform called TeleVox to send automated 
calls and text reminders to parents ac cording to their preferences which are recorded in the Electronic Health Record 
(EHR).

Response variables (outcomes) :  
• Appointment was scheduled  within 2 weeks of intervention (Y/N) (date of actual appointment may be 
greater than 2 weeks from intervention)  
• Appointment was completed  within 8 weeks of intervent ion (Y/N). Appointment completed within 8 
weeks of randomization will be used for group who does not receive any intervention.  
• (Primary Outcome) Receipt of MMR by 15 months of age or receipt of 2nd MMR dose by 3 months after 
randomization (Y/N)  
• Receipt of 1st COVID vaccination (ages 12 -17 years) within 8 weeks of first intervention (Y/N)  
• Family member receipt of COVID vaccination in our health system within 8 weeks of first intervention  
 
Blocking : (controlling for factors that might influence the  outcome)  
• Age (12 -14 months, 4 years)  
• Clinic location (PPC, HPC, FPC)  
 
Personal Contacts (12 -14 months & 4 -year -olds) Trial:  
Randomization : Eligible patient will be identified by running a report in the electronic health record (EHR).  We 
will run this re port, stratified by clinic location, and randomly assign patients into one of the four groups created by 
our 2 X 2 design.  Groups will receive their assigned intervention in one of four successive weeks with the sequence 
randomly assigned (see table below ). 
 
Replication : We will conduct a total of 3 trials, repeating the randomization procedure every 4 weeks to identify 
children who become eligible:  Weeks 1 -4 = trial #1, weeks 5 -8 = trial #2, weeks 9 -12 = trial #3.

Of note, automated messages and/or personal contact attempts will not be completed if the parent schedules an 
appointment after being randomized but before receiving the intervention.  
 
Covariates for logistic regression :  (factors that might influence the outcome if not be b alanced across groups)  
1. Child age at the time of randomization (rationale: visits are less frequent for children age 4 years)  
2. Parent preference for call vs. text mode of contact (rationale: calls may be more likely to get blocked than 
texts)  
3. Parent with act ivated MyChart account (Y/N) (rationale: not dependent on calling scheduling center to 
make appointment)  
Outreach Methods Study Protocol & SAP  
Version 1.1,  6/27/22 
pg. 8 
 4. Access to appointment: Number of days to 3rd next available appointment at patient’s clinic at time their 
first automated message is sent  
5. Patient recei pt of any past immunizations (Y/N) (rationale: vaccine refusing parents will be unlikely to 
change even if they return for well child check)  
6. School -age vs. adolescent patient age (rationale: adolescents less likely to get yearly check -ups) 
7. Historical no -show rate  
8. Community rates of COVID based on 7 day moving average.  
 
 
Power/Sample Size  
 
Personal Contacts (12 -14 month & 4 -year -olds) Trial:  
We based our hypotheses (see table, below) on a systematic review’s pooled estimates of effect size for automated 
messages and personalized calls finding 37% and 40% of children, respectively, completed immunizations.1 
Because of the significant cost involved in making personal contacts, the minimal difference in outcome that would 
make it worth the effort i s high.   
 
Hypotheses  % of children who receive MMR by 15 
months of age  
 1 automated 
message sent  2 automated 
messages sent  
0 personal attempts  20% C 35% B 
1 personal attempt  50% A 65% AB 
 
We calculated sample size needed per group to detect a difference for each of the contrasts below with alpha of 0.05 
and power of 80%.  
 
Contrast  Sample Size per 
Group  
A vs C  36 
B vs C  136 
A vs. B  167 
A vs. AB  167 
B vs. AB  40 
C vs. AB  16 
 
To fully power the 2 X 2 factorial trail, we estimate needing 167 per group X 4 groups = 668 total subjects.  There 
are currently 712 children eligible for the study. More will become eligible every month so we expect to far exceed 
the required sample size after 3 replications.  If needed, we could increase t he number of replications of the trial to 
reach the targeted sample size.  We acknowledge that we are not powered to precisely estimate any interactions 
between interventions.  
 
MyChart Trial:  
In hypothesis testing for 0 message vs. 1 message vs. 2 messages, we will do the testing in a fixed sequence -  test 2 
messages vs. 0 message first, only if it is significant then test 2 messages vs. 1 message, thus the type I error rate of 
0.05 is retaine d. Since the hypothesis testing of 2 messages vs. 0 message would be considered easier to achieve 
than the hypothesis testing of 2 messages vs. 1 message,  the power analysis for this trial should be based on the 
design of (standard message vs.   tailored me ssage) by (1 message vs. 2 messages). We based our hypotheses (see 
table, below) on previous work indicating approximately 20% WCC appointment completion on automated text 
reminders.  We anticipate that a tailored message increases the WCC appointment comp letion rate by another 10%.  
 
Hypotheses   % of children complete WCC within 8 
weeks

We calculated sample size needed per group to detect a difference for each of the contrasts below with alpha of 0.05 
and power of 80%.  
 
Contrast  Sample Size per 
Group  
A vs C  199 
B vs C  199 
A vs. AB  293 
B vs. AB  293 
C vs. AB  62 
 
We assume no difference between A vs. B and thus not consider powering the comparison between these two 
groups, but we will explore non -inferiority analysis for this comparison in data analysis. To fully power the above 
contrasts, we estimate needing 293 per group X 4 groups = 1172 subjects. Adding 293 in th e zero message group, 
we would need a total of 1465 subjects. There are currently 1000 children eligible for the study. More will become 
eligible every month so we expect to exceed the required sample size after 2 replications. If needed, we could 
increase  the number of replications of this trial to reach the targeted sample size.  We acknowledge that we are not 
powered to precisely estimate any interactions between interventions.  
 
Televox (6 -11yo) Trial:  
We calculated sample size based on the following hyp otheses:  
 
% of children complete WCC within 8 weeks  
no message  2 Low Tailored 
Messages  
 2 High Tailored 
Messages  
 
2% 20% 30% 
 
With alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, to fully power the contrasts between the above groups, we need 293 per 
group X 3 groups=879 subjects. Currently there are 2500 kids eligible, so we expect to reach the targeted sample 
size.  
 
Televox (12 -17yo) Trial:  
We calculated sample size based on the following hypotheses:  
 
% of children complete WCC within 8 weeks  
no message  2 Low Tailored 
Messages  
 2 COVID Tailored 
Messages  
 
2% 30% 40% 
 
With alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, to fully power the contrasts between the above groups, we need 356 per 
group X 3 groups=1068 subjects. Currently there are 1100 kids eligible, so we expect to reach the targeted sample 
size.  
 
 
Analysis  
We will conduct descriptive analyses to characterize the participants in terms of demographics and other potential 
covariates in consideration (child age group, parent’s preference for call vs. text mode of contact, whether parent 
Outreach Methods Study Protocol & SAP  
Version 1.1,  6/27/22 
pg. 10 
 had activated MyChart account, access to appointment,  whether patient receipt of any past immunizations, historic 
no show rate, and community rates of COVID).  We will use chi square tests to examine whether participants in the 
4 groups are similar in these characteristics.  
 
For the Personal Contact (12 -14 mo & 4 years old) trials,we will conduct intent -to-treat analyses using logistic 
regression models (without adjusting for covariates)  for each of our three binary outcomes: completed appointment 
within 2 weeks, c ompleted  appointment  within 8 weeks, receipt of MMR by 15 months of age or receipt of 2nd 
MMR by 3 months after randomization. We will do pair -wise comparison among the 4 groups and adjust p value of 
each comparison for multiplicity. If participants in the 4 groups differ on potential covariates, we will conduct 
additional analyses adjusted for these variables.   
 
For the MyChart and Televox Trials (6 -17 years old), we will conduct intent -to-treat analyses using logistic 
regression models (without adjusting for covariates)  for each of the binary outcomes: scheduled appointment within 
2 weeks, c ompleted  appointment within 8 weeks, receipt of 1st dose of COVID vaccination (age 12 -17 years) within 
8 weeks, family member receipt of COVID vaccination within 8 weeks. We will do pair -wise comparison among the 
treatment groups and adjust p value of each comparison for multiplicity. If participants diffe r in potential covariates 
across treatment groups, we will conduct additional analyses adjusted for these variables. We will explore non -
inferiority analysis for comparison the two groups that are expected to have similar appointment scheduled and 
completi on rate in the MyChart trial.  
 
We will also conduct per -protocol analyses according to the interventions actually received by the participants, 
recognizing that actual intervention received could be different from initial randomized intervention. . For ex ample, 
a parent allocated to group A might schedule an appointment after receiving the automated message and therefore 
would not receive a personalized contact attempt. In addition, we may explore potential interaction between the two 
interventions as a se condary analysis. All analysis will be conducted using SAS version 9.4.  
 
Duration  
The study will begin upon IRB approval and continue through December 31, 2022.  During this time, we will 
discuss the significance of data, potential future projects and dis semination of results.  
 
Process of Obtaining Consent  
For this study, we request a waiver of consent due to the minimal risk to participants involved. Given the population 
we are attempting to contact using the various outreach methods has missed appointmen ts, it would not be possible 
to obtain prospective consent.  That said, we will honor parent preferences for how they receive automated 
messages.  Collected data about appointment attendance and MMR vaccination status is already being documented 
in the EHR , and the collection of data will not affect the rights and welfare of subjects.  
 
We request waiver of consent such that there is (1) potential, minimal, risks to the participant (see below), (2) de -
identification of PHI, and (3) participation in the study  will not affect current/future care received through CCHMC.  
 
All identifying information will be removed once data collection is complete. Data will be kept securely on a 
CCHMC computer that is password protected. Any hard copies of data will be locked in  a private office.

Data analysis will be done on the Main Campus of CCHMC and at the CCHMC primary care offices (PPCC, HPC, 
FPC, and SBHCs).  
 
Potential Benefits  
The results of this study will aid CCHMC pediatric primary ca re centers in improving and redesigning an outreach 
system to children behind on necessary preventative services who have gaps in needed primary care.  It will identify 
the most effective ways to reach, engage, and schedule patients for care when appropria te.  This will enable the 
primary care offices to allocate the appropriate amount of resource to outreach efforts moving forward, ensuring 
high risk children receive reminders for care.

 The on ly significant risks are breach of confidentiality and potential discomfort/inconvenience associated with 
receiving texts or phone calls indicating that care gaps exist for a child.  As noted above, personal health information 
(PHI) will be obtained via th e electronic medical record.  After obtaining this information, patients will be de -
identified in the created database and securely stored.  
 
Risk/Benefit analysis  
While immediate benefit to any given individual or family is unknown, this study involves mi nimal risk.  
 
Cost of Participation  
 
There is no cost for participation.  
 
Payment for Participation  
There is no reimbursement for participation.  
 
Request for HIPAA Waiver  
The use or disclosure of the PHI involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals based on the 
presence of the following elements:  
-We plan to protect health information identifiers from improper use and disclosure by secure storage.  
-We have an adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity cons istent with conduct of the research.  
-We ensure the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to (shared with) any other person or entity, except as required by 
law, for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the use or discl osure of the PHI 
would be permitted under the Privacy Rule.

 The results of the Outreach Methods  study will be assess ed as described in this document. This statistical analysis 
plan begins with an overview of the key components of the study, including its design, objectives, and outcomes 
measures. This is followed by a detailed description of the statistical analyses that will be utilized to address study 
hypotheses.  
1. Overview of study: This study used a multi -arm randomized control trial to test the impact of patient portal 
outreach messages , with and without tailoring , on the scheduling and co mpletion of well  child care visits  
(WCC) and completion of vaccinations . We randomized e ligible patients to the Standard Message group, the 
Tailored Message group, or the Control Group. We generated random allocation sequence stratified by clinic 
location using block randomization (with a block size of 3). Based on sample size calculations, w e planned to 
enroll a minimum of 879 subjects overall aged 6-17 years  old that met eligibility criteria based on data obtained 
from the electronic health record (EHR) from three academic pediatric primary care practices.  
1.1 Study Objective:  Test the effectiveness of  patient portal outreach messages , with and without tailoring , on the 
scheduling and completion of  well child care visit s (WCC) in children  due for preventative services.  
Working  hypothesis:  Twenty percent of patients in the Standard Message group, 30% of patients 
in the Tailored Message  group, and 2% of those in the control group will complete a  well child 
care visit  within 8 weeks.  
 
1.2 Outcome measure s 
Primary   
• Well child care visit completed within 8 weeks of receiving first intervention  
o Appointment completed (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
Secondary  
• Well child care visit scheduled within 2 weeks of receiving first intervention  
o Appointment scheduled (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
• Child receipt of COVID -19 vaccine within 8 weeks of receiving first intervention  among eligible 
patients (age ≥12 years at the time of the study)  
o COVID -19 vaccine administered (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
 
1.3 Time points of interest  
• Scheduled wel l child care visit (within 2 weeks of receiving first intervention)  
• Completed well  child care visit (within 8 weeks  of receiving first interventi on) 
• Receipt of COVID -19 vaccine (within 8 weeks of receiving first intervention)  
 
1.4 Data Management  
CCHMC CRC will guide data management for this project as described in the study protocol.  
1.5 Interim Safety Analyses

 2.2 Analysis Populations  
2.2.1 Completion  
Subjects will be considered to have completed the study on the  study end date on 8/5/21. 
2.2.2 Missing data  
We will use data obtained from patient’s electronic health record (EHR) to calculate our primary and secondary 
outcomes. Missing outcome data could occur for several reasons, such as errors  of medical documentation or the 
patient no longer in the primary care  registry.  
2.3 Statistical Report Contents  
The following section outlines the contents of the final statistical analysis. For all analyses,  subjects who are 
enrolled in the study and are eligible will be analyzed in the groups to which they were a llocated.  
2.3.1 Description of study population  
Sample size:  
The total number of subjects who are enrolled  will be given.  
Demographics and Clinical Characteristics, Patient and Parent:  
Demographic and clinical characteristics as measured at baseline will be summarized by trial arm. Variables to be 
summarized are: child age, child  sex, child  race, child  ethnicity, insurance, parent communication preference  
absence of past patient receipt of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or diphtheria, tetanus and acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccine as a proxy for childhood vaccine refusal, and patient lifetime historical institutional no -
show rate . Variables will be summarized using descriptive stat istics appropriate for each type of data item.  
Baseline c haracteristics with large differences between groups will be included in analyses  as covariates .  
2.3.2 Primary outcome analysis  
Primary  outcome: Well child care visit completed within 8 weeks of first message sent or date of randomization for 
the control group.  
o Appointment completed  (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
For the primary outcome, we will use a logistic regression model to examine appointment completion within 8  
weeks among the three randomized groups. We converted the odds ratios estimated into risk ratios to ease 
interpretation. If participants differ in potential covariates across treatment groups, we will conduct additional 
analyses adjusted for these variabl es.  
2.3.3 Secondary outcome analyses  
• Well child care visit scheduled within 2 weeks of first messages sent or date of randomization for the 
control group.  
We will use a logistic regression model to examine appointment scheduling  within 2 weeks among the three 
randomized groups. We converted the odds ratios estimated into risk ratios to ease interpretation. If participants 
differ in potential covariates across treatment groups, we will conduct additional analyses adjusted for these 
variables.  
• Receipt of 1st dose of COVID -19 vaccination among eligible patients within 8 weeks of first message 
sent or date of randomization for the control group

Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 4 3 Dec 2014 1. SYNOPSIS  
Name of Sponsor/Company: Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
Name of Investigational Product: WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Name of Active Ingredient: WT2725 
Title of Study: Initial Phase  1 Study of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion in Patients with Advanced 
Malignancies  
Study Center(s): Part 1: 4-8 clinical sites in the United States  (US). Part  2: an additional 2 sites in the 
US may be  included.  
Phase of Development: 1 
Study Objectives:  
Primary:  
The primary objectives are:  
• to evaluate the safety and tolerability of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
• to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion based on 
the evaluation of  dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)  
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives are:  
• to describe antitumor responses to WT2725 Dosing Emulsion based on the immune- related 
response criteria (irRC) ( Wolchok-2009, Hoos-2010), modified International Working 
Group response c riteria in acute myeloid leukemia (IWG) ( Cheson-2003), and/or tumor 
markers 
• to evaluate the immune responses to WT2725 Dosing Emulsion based on a series of circulating biomarkers in peripheral blood, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to the 
WT2725 peptide, and immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue 
Other: 
The other objectives are:  
• to evaluate immune response by level of Wilms’ tumor gene product (WT1) pr otein 
expression in tumor cells 
• to obtain blood serum for future retrospective analyses of additional biomarkers  
Study Design: This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose- escalation , 2-part study in adult patients with 
advanced malignancies known to overexpress the WT1 protein. The study will primarily evaluate DLT 
and define the MTD of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion during the DLT Evaluation Period, which extends 
from the day of the first dose of study drug to just prior to the fifth dose (Days 1 - 29). In addition, 
antitumor activity and biomarkers indicative of immune response will be evaluated from the first dose 
until discontinuation of the patient from the study. An end of study assessment will take place within 
28 days after the last dose of study drug and prior to the start of alternate antineoplastic therapy.  
The initial patients in each dose escalation cohort will b e enrolled at least one week apart to evaluate

initial safety from the first 2  patients, then a “rolling -six” design will be employed that allows accrual 
of 2 to 6 patients concurrently in each dose escalation cohort. 
In Part 1 of the study, t he 0.3 mg cohort will be conducted first . After safety and tolerability have been 
established for the first cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in 
subsequent cohorts and continue until the MTD or all planned cohorts are attained.  Enrollment of each 
cohort may include patients with any of the eligible tumor types (see below). Enrollment of the highest 
tolerable dose cohort (MTD or highest planned cohort) will continue until there are at least 6 patients 
total in the study with each  tumor type that are evaluable for DLT, biomarkers, and response. This dose 
is considered the reco mmended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Enrollment of up to 3 RP2D cohorts of 
10 patients each of a specific tumor type may take place at this dose in order to further c haracterize the 
safety and efficacy of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion at this dose in these subsets of patients. Additional 
dose escalation cohorts after the initial expansion cohort s may be enrolled if a MTD has not been 
determined and significant signs of toxici ty have not been observed in the expansion cohorts. 
In Part 2 of the study, the 18.0 mg cohort will be conducted first. A fter safety and tolerability have 
been established for the 18.0 mg cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted 
sequentially in the 27.0 mg  cohort. Approximately 10 patien ts at each dose level (18.0 and 27.0 mg) 
with at least 4  patients with each malignancy type (glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) 
will be enrolled at each of these dose levels.  If the MTD is reached in Part  2 before the total of 
20 patients are enrolled, remaining patients will be enrolled at the prior dose level. In the event that a 
dose level is excluded from further study due to dose limiting toxicity all patients may continue the 
study at the most recently completed dose without DLT, eg, if the 27.0 mg dose is excluded due to 
DLT all patients may continue at 18.0 mg.  
Patients who have completed the consolidation phase of their assigned cohort and have not experienced a DLT, ≥ Grade  2 study drug -related injection -site reaction, or required a dose reduction may have 
their dose escalated to that of the highest cohort for which safety and tolerability have been established. The expected time to enroll each dose escalation cohort (2 – 6 patients) is between 6 and 12 weeks.  
Each part of the study will include 3 treatment phases based on intended timing of study drug dosing as 
indicated below: 
Part 1: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7 days for 4  weeks (doses 1  - 5) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 6 weeks (doses 6 - 9) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 10 and thereafter)  
Part 2: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 8 weeks (doses 1 - 9) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14  days for 10 weeks (doses 10 – 15 [maximum of 
6 doses]) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 16 and thereafter)  
Number of Patients (planned): Approximately  60-80 patients total in Parts  1 and 2 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Part 1: Adult patients with one of the following

histologically or cytologically documented advanced stage malignancies: non -small cell lung, ovarian, 
glioblastoma, and AML not including acute promyelocytic leukemia, known to overexpress the WT1 
protein who have progressive or recurrent measurable (may be measurable by tumor markers only, 
such as quantitative reverse transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction [RT -PCR] for WT1 transcript for 
AML, or cancer antigen 125 [CA- 125] for ovarian carcinoma) neoplastic disease despite administration 
of standard therapy or for whom no standard of therapy exists are eligible for enrollment in this study. Patients must also be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201+ and/or HLA-A*0206+; have an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0, 1, or 2; have adequate bone marrow and immune reserve and renal and hepatic function; and meet criteria for recovery from 
effects of previous antineoplastic therapies.  
Part 2: Adult patients with histologically or cytologically documented advanced stage glioblastoma or 
AML not including acute promyelocytic leukemia, known to overexpress the WT1 protein who have progressive or recurrent measurable (may be measurable by tumor markers only, such as quantitative 
RT-PCR for WT1 transcript for AML) neoplastic disease despite administration of standard therapy or 
for whom no standard of therapy exists are eligible for enrollment in this study. Patients mu st also be 
HLA-A*0201+ and/or HLA-A*0206+; have an ECOG Performance Status score of 0, 1, or 2; have 
adequate bone marrow and immune reserve and renal and hepatic function; and meet criteria for 
recovery from effects of previous antineoplastic therapies.  
Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Part 1: 
The following dose cohorts are planned: 
• 0.3, 0.9, 3.0 , and 9.0 mg WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
All study drug will be administered by subcutaneous ( sc) injection (at 2  anatomical sites) once every 
7 days for 4 weeks, then once every 14  days for 6  weeks, and then once every 28 days until 
discontinuation. 
 
Part 2: 
The following dose cohorts are planned: 
• 18.0 and 27.0 mg WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
All study drug will be administered by sc injection (at 2  anatomical sites) once every 7  days for 
8 weeks, then once every 14  days for 10 weeks, and then once every 28  days until discontinuation.  
Duration of Treatment: Patients may remain on study drug until evidence of confirmed progressive 
disease, intolerance to treatment with study drug, or fulfillment of any of the other criteria for 
discontinuation.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration: Not applicable  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary Endpoints:  
The safety and tolerability of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be evaluated based on the occurrence of 
DLT and AEs, and the findings from clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, body weight measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.

Name of Investigational Product: WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Name of Active Ingredient: WT2725 
The determination of the MTD of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be based on the incidence of DLT at 
each dose level and the overall safety profile of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion. The incidence of DLT will 
be evaluated during the DLT Evaluation Period, which extends from the day of the first dose to just 
prior to the fifth dose of study drug (Days  1 to 29). No more than 4 doses of study drug will be 
administered during the DLT Evaluation Period. 
Dose-limiting toxicities are defined as any Grade  3 or greater AE that occurs after the administration of 
study drug during the DLT Evaluation Period that are not related to underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medications ( Changes in hematology parameters need to have been confirmed 
on repeat assessment  and constitute at least a  2 grade shift . Grade 3 AEs of nausea, vomiting, and 
fatigue that are common and manageable in cancer patients will not be considered DLT if they can be 
ameliorated to  < Grade 3 with standard supportive care management.). Adverse events will be graded 
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.0. 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Proportion of patients in each overall response category for each dose cohort based on 
irRC, modified IWG, and/or tumor markers, as appropriate, at each post -treatment tumor 
assessment and at the last assessment  
• Percent change in tumor burden from baseline to each post- treatment tumor assessment 
and the last tumor assessment for each dose cohort  
• The amount of immune response evaluated by: 
o measurement in peripheral blood of WT1 peptide- specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte  
(CTL) induction activity at each assessment time 
o measurement in peripheral blood of WT1 serum antibody titer at each assessment time 
o delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to the W T2725 peptide at each assessment 
time 
o measurement of level of expression of CD8+, Foxp3, HLA class  I, and WT1 
protein in tumor tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods 
Exploratory Endpoints:  
• Correlation between the level of expression of WT1 protein and the degree of the immune response at each assessment time as measured by CTL induction  
• Evaluation of changes in activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after 
administration of study drug  
Statistical Methods:  
The Safety population will include all enrolled patients who receive at least 1  dose of study drug and 
will be used for the analysis of all safety and efficacy data except as noted. If needed, a DLT 
population will include all patients in the Safety population who are evaluable for DLT evaluation and 
will be used for analysis of DLT. If needed, an Efficacy population will include all patients in the 
Safety population who are evaluable for response and will be  used for analysis of response.  
Data will generally be summarized by enrolled or starting dose. Descriptive statistics including number 
of patients, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum 
will be provided.  
No imputation will be performed for missing data in this Phase 1 study.

Safety measures will be summarized using descriptive statistics by enrolled dose cohort and listed for 
each patient. Adverse events also will be summarized by last dose administered before event start.  
Sample Size Calculation: The sample size is based on clinical and practical considerations for a 
Phase 1 dose escalation study using the rolling -six design, and is outside of statistical considerations.

Confidential and Propri etary 19 3 Dec 2014 4. INTRODUCTION 
Cancer vaccines consisting of synthetic cancer antigen -derived peptides designed to elicit T cell 
immunity have been evaluated as a potential treatment for cancer in clinical trials for more than a 
decade. Although the success rate in inducing specific T -cell responses has been mixed, there 
have been reports of minor tumor regression and occasional objective responses. 
Recent scientific advances have resulted in the identification of a large number of tumor-
associated antigens (TAAs) and their epitopes recognized by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from various types of malignant neoplasms 
(Buonaguro-2011). Cytotoxic T cells kill cancer cells by recognizing the major 
histocompatibility ( MHC) class  I-peptide complex on the surface of cancer cells. One such TAA 
is the Wilms’ tumor gene product 1 (WT1), which was isolated as a gene responsible for Wilms’ 
tumor, a pediatric renal cancer, and encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, which is involved 
in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and organ development. Expression of the 
wild-type WT1 gene has been found in various types of malignant tumors ( Hutchings-2007 ) such 
as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) at levels higher than those in normal bone marrow or peripheral blood and can 
confer oncogenic functions ( Sugiyama -2005). In addition, various types of solid tumors, 
including breast, lung, thyroid, ovarian, glioblastoma, and colorectal, express the wild-type WT1 
protein at higher levels than surrounding normal tissues ( Nakatsuka- 2006, Oji -2004). 
Injection of peptides in aqueous solutions alone is generally not effective in stimulating CTL 
response. Therefore, adjuvants, such as water- in-oil (W/O) emulsion, have been used to enhance 
the immunog enicity of TAAs by creating a depot effect that prevents access of the immunogen 
to tissue and blood-borne proteases, while facilitating TAAs translocation into antigen-presenting cells.  
The WT2725 drug product is referred to as WT2725 Dosing Emulsion and consists of WT2725, 
the acetate salt of a synthetic peptide with the same sequence as the naturally occurring peptide WT1
126-134, diluted in a peptide diluting solution, and administered with a novel adjuvant (W/O 
pre-Emulsion). WT2725 administered intradermally (id) or subcutaneously (sc), is thought to be 
presented on the surface of antigen- presenting cells, eg, dendritic cells, as an MHC class 
I-peptide complex to be recognized by T cells. As a consequence, vaccination with WT2725 
Dosing Emulsion may stimulate the host immune system to induce a CTL response against 
cancer cells that overexpress the WT1 protein, resulting in cell lysis and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. 
Nonclinical in vitro pharmacology studies confirmed that the WT2725 peptide bound to the 
human antigen-presenting molecule, HLA-A*0201, and induced CD8+ T cells reactive to the WT1
126-134 peptide in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from an 
HLA-A*0201+ healthy donor. Nonclinical in vivo pharmacology studies confirmed that 
WT2725 Injection mixed with the novel W/O pre-Emulsion induced HLA-A*0201- restricted and 
WT2725 peptide- specific CTLs in HLA-A*0201-expressing transgenic mice.  
Additionally, when the WT2725 peptide sequence was analyzed using a web server for the prediction of human MHC class I-peptide binding, the binding affinity to HLA-A*0206 was strong therefore suggesting that WT2725 is expected to bind to not only HLA-A*0201 but also 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 20 3 Dec 2014 HLA-A*0206. HLA-A*0206- restricted and WT1 126-134-reactive CTLs were induced using 
HLA-A*0206 + PBMCs and the induced CTLs showed killing activity to a target cell line 
transfected with HLA -A*0206 and endogenously expressing WT1 protein (International 
Application Published under the Patent Cooperation Treaty: WO2009/072610). It is reported that 
valine and glutamine at position  2 in peptides are anchor residues of HLA-A*0206 ( Sudo-1995) 
and that valine and leucine at position 9 are anchor residues of HLA -A*0206. The WT2725 
peptide has an anchor residue of HLA-A*0206 at position 9. Several HLA -A*0201 binding 
peptides which have an anchor residue of HLA-A*0206 at position 9 are reported to be presented 
by HLA-A*0206 or to elicit a CTL response with restriction of HLA-A*0206 ( Eifuku-2001, 
Fleischhauer -1996, Li-2008, Zhang -2003). 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 13-weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys, id or sc 
injection of the planned clinical WT2725 Dosing Emulsion was associated with macroscopic and 
microscopic findings along with clinical observations at the injection site. Additionally, non-
adverse macroscopic and microscopic findings were observed at the injection site following id or 
sc administration of  the Control dosing emulsion. The skin reactions observed following 
administration of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion were the dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) in these 
studies, were noted to be reversible, and are readily monitorable with regular observation of the injection site.  
In a bacterial reverse gene mutation (Ames) assay and an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, 
WT2725 did not induce mutations or chromosomal aberrations. 
In vitro studies demonstrated that WT2725 was unstable in human and monkey blood, and 
WT2725 was not detected in monkey plasma at any time point after a single id or sc administration.  
In previous clinical stu dies of the WT1
126-134 peptide (administered with various adjuvants and 
combination therapy), few significant adverse reactions were noted, however various local skin reactions were observed  (Kaida-2011, Keilholz-2009, Kuball-2011, Rezvani -2008, 
Gentilini-2006, Soeda-2010).  
Rezvani et al  (2008) reported that WT1
126-134 peptide in combination with PR1 169-177 peptide 
using Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant and granulocyte macrophage- colony stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF) resulted in induction of WT1- specific CD8+ T cells . Additionally, Maslak et al  
(2010) using a vaccine of multiple WT1 peptides reported WT1- specific T -cell responses in the 
majority of patients and significant increases in interferon (IFN) -γ-secreting cells and frequency 
of WT1 tetramer+ CD8+  T cells in patients who were HLA-A*0201+. 
This first clinical study of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion is an open-label, dose escalation design to evaluate the safety and tolerability of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion delivered via sc injection in 
order to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Additionally, antitumor activity and biomarkers indicative of immune response will be evaluated. WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be administered as monotherapy to patients with one of the followin g advanced malignancies: 
non-small cell lung, ovarian, glioblastoma, and AML (not including acute promyelocytic leukemia), known to overexpress the WT1 protein. Tumors that do not overexpress the WT1 
protein will not be sensitive to WT1 -specific CTLs therefore a subset of malignancies that do 
overexpress the WT1 protein was selected based on a review of the literature ( Franko-2010, 
Nakatsuka-2006, Oji-2003). A rolling-six design ( Skolnik-2008) will be used for enrollment into 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 21 3 Dec 2014 ascending dose cohorts to deter mine the MTD. Patients may remain on study drug until there is 
evidence of confirmed progressive disease, intolerance to treatment with study drug, or 
fulfillment of any of the other criteria for discontinuation. 
4.1. Study Rationale  
Parenteral administration o f the WT2725 peptide results in detection and presentation on the 
surface of antigen presenting cells, eg, dendritic cells, as an MHC class I -peptide complex to be 
recognized by T cells. As a result, vaccination with WT2725 Dosing Emulsion may stimulate th e 
host immune system to induce a CTL response against WT1- expressing cells, resulting in cell 
lysis and inhibition of cancer cell pr oliferation.  
Treatment with other WT1 peptide vaccines in clinical trials has shown evidence of 
immunogenicity and clinical response in various malignancies. Based on the nonclinical findings 
for WT2725 and the reported clinical results with other WT1 peptide vaccines in cancer patients 
there is an expectation that some clinical benefit may be derived from treatment with WT2725  
Dosing Emulsion. In these other clinical trials, as well as in the nonclinical studies of WT2725, 
there have been limited significant adverse effects other than local injection site skin reactions.  
This study will assist with determining which doses level(s) to use in future clinical studies. In addition, this study will evaluate both clinical and immunological response. 
4.2. Dose Justification  
4.2.1. Starting Dose Level  
Two repeat -dose toxicology studies of up to 13-weeks duration conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys using the planned clinical WT2725 Dosing Emulsion administered id (1.0 and 
3.0 mg/body) and sc (3.0 and 9.0 mg/body) once a week were conducted. In both studies, 
WT2725 Dosing Emulsion was associated with macroscopic and microscopic findings along with clinical observations at the injection site. Clinical observations at the injection site consisted 
of swelling, erythema, and/or crust which, in some cases, progressed to ulceration and erosion. 
These skin reactions were the DLT as persistence of ulceration/erosi on for up to 5 days led to 
early euthanasia in some animals and discontinuation of dosing in the high dose groups after the 
tenth or eleventh administration in females and males, respectively. In surviving animals, the 
skin reactions at the injection site were noted to be reversible with discontinuation of dosing and 
administration of topical or intramuscular antibiotics. Systemic toxicological findings were 
limited to intermittent decreases in body weight and alterations in hematology and blood 
chemistry p arameters that were judged to be secondary to stress and inflammatory changes at the 
injection site.  
A clinical study of a HLA -A*02-restricted WT1
126-134 peptide vaccine, in which a peptide with 
the same sequence as the WT2725 peptide was administered with  the Montanide ISA- 51VG 
adjuvant, reported administration of 1.0 and 3.0 mg dose levels without apparent DLT 
(Kaida-2011 ). Vaccine (0.1 mL) was injected id into 6 sites (bilateral arms, 2  sites on the lower 
abdomen, and femoral areas) biweekly on Days 8 an d 22. Gemcitabine was administered 
concurrently on Days 1, 8, and 15. Although the scheduled study period was 2 courses, treatment was continued at the patient’s request if there was no disease progression or serious adverse 
events (SAEs). Grade 1 or 2 ski n reaction at the site of vaccination, characterized by redness, 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 22 3 Dec 2014 pruritus, and induration, was observed in all patients (n = 25). WT1- specific T cells in peptide-
stimulated culture were detected by tetramer assay in 46% (5  of 11) of patients. 
The results o f this clinical trial provide information about the safety of the WT1 126-134 peptide 
vaccine based on pharmacological action of WT1 126-134 peptide specific CTL. Although the 
adjuvant used in the clinical trial was different from that of the WT2725 Dosing E mulsion in its 
composition, the potential to induce WT1 126-134 peptide specific CTL with the Montanide 
ISA-51VG adjuvant and the novel W/O pre -Emulsion  for WT2725 Dosing Emulsion was 
evaluated and found to be similar in HLA -A02 transgenic mice. Furthermore, the W/O 
pre-Emulsion to be used with WT2725 by itself caused no severe skin lesion or systemic toxicity 
in the 13-week cynomolgus monkey studies . In addition, t he same W/O pre -Emulsion  has 
already been administered to several patient s in 2 ongoing clinical trials of another modified 
peptide from the HLA -A*2402- restricted WT1 235-243 peptide in Japan. In the Phase 1 solid tumor 
trial, as of 31 Dec  2011, for 3 enrolled patients only Grade  1 adverse events (AEs) had been 
reported including injection site reactions and for 1 additional patient Grade  2 injection site 
reaction and hypertension had been reported; this is preliminary draft data from an active, 
unlocked database and subject to change (data on file Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd). In the 
Phase 1/2 MDS study, as of the same date, for the one enrolled patient no injection site reactions 
had been observed, although Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and leucopenia, and Grade 2 urticaria had been reported in addition to other Grade 1 AEs; this is preliminary draft data from an active, unlocked database and subject to change (data 
on file Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd). Because low blood cell counts are common with 
MDS and there have been few other toxiciti es greater than Grade 1 in these trials, the novel W/O 
pre-Emulsion  used with WT2725 is not expected to cause unexpected  severe AEs. 
In terms of clinical efficacy, it has been reported  that sc injection s of 0.2 mg WT1
126-134 peptide 
in combination with 0.5 mg PR1169-177 peptide using Montanide ISA-51VG adjuvant and 
GM-CSF resulted in induction of WT1- specific CD8+ T cells ( Rezvani-2008). The dose of 
0.2 mg per peptide also has been reported to be within the range found to be safe and active for 
other peptide vaccines ( Maslak-2010). These reports  suggest that this dose level may have a 
likelihood of immunologic al activity. 
For this study, a clinical starting dose of 0.3 mg/body  (2 injection sites ) is planned for Part  1, 
based on the following considerations: 
1. 0.3 mg/body by sc administration  is equivalent to 1/10th the lower dose (3.0 mg/body 
WT2725 Dosing Emulsion) in the sc  cynomolgus monkey study at which a severe skin 
lesion (ulceration ) was noted in one animal . Of note, similar lesions observed at the 
highest dose (9.0 mg/body) showed reversibility with discontinuation of dosing and 
antibiotic treatment. In addition, skin lesions observed in the 1.0 mg/body id cohort 
showed reversibility without discontinuation of dosing or antibiotic treatment. 
2. Similar skin lesions have been observed in clinical studies of WT1 126-134 peptide (doses 
ranging from 0.2 mg – 3 mg) (Kaida-2011, Keilholz -2009, Kuball-2011, Rezvani -2008, 
Gentilini-2006, Soeda-2010). Treatment for these skin lesions has included dermal steroid treatment and  topical nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs . 
3. There were no DLTs reported from the published clinical studies of the naturally occurring WT
1126-134 peptide. A dose of 0.3 mg/body is approximately 1/10th the dose of 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 23 3 Dec 2014 WT1126-134 peptide already used clinically, albeit with a different adjuvant, different 
administration route, and different number of injection sites. 
4. As it is ethically important to select a starting dose at which some clinical benefit for 
cancer patients may be ex pected, based on the results of clinical studies of other WT1 
peptides 0.3 mg/body is anticipated to be within an immunologically active dose range.  
4.2.2. Additional Dose Levels for Part 2 
Initial dose escalation in this study was completed, with the highest pla nned dose of 9.0 mg 
being administered without dose- limiting toxicity. This dose was considered the recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D), and additional patients  were enrolled and initiate d treatment at this dose. 
As of May 2014 the most common drug- related adverse reactions  reported with doses up to 
9.0 mg were low grade localized injection site reactions with itching, erythema, pain, bruising , 
and/or swelling. A total of 14 treatment emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 
9 patients; there was  no pattern in the types of treatment emergent SAEs reported. Two serious 
adverse reactions (SARs; defined as SAEs that were assessed as at least possibly related to study 
drug) were reported in 2 patients; tumor necrosis was reported in 1 patient, and ras h maculo-
papular was reported in 1 patient. Further with the expanded cohorts of patients treated at 9.0 mg, no important unanticipated risks, potential risks, or safety signals have been observed, the 9.0 mg dose is not considered the MTD. Preliminary review of efficacy data indicates that 
WT2725 Dosing Emulsion has the potential to be of benefit to patients, which may be further 
enhanced by more regular injections in the early stages of treatment. Based on the results from these initial patients  in Part 1, additional dose escalation, at no more than double the prior dose 
level, is being explored to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy. In addition, extension of the induction and consolidation phases of treatment will be explored. 
4.2.3. Route of Administration  
Langerhans cells, which function as antigen -presenting cells, are widely distributed within the 
epidermis, and there are multiple reports of id and sc dosing of cancer vaccines to sequester 
antigen in the intradermal or subcutaneous tissue near the epidermis to ensure efficient recognition. A previous clinical study using WT1
235-243, 2M→Y peptide  (Oka-2008, Oka -2004) 
demonstrated that there was induction of WT1-specific CTL as a result of id dosing. A study by Keilholz et al ( 2009) of WT1
126-134 peptide in keyhole- limpet-hemocyanin adjuvant plus 
GM-CSF demonstrated induction of WT1-specific CTL following id and sc injection and 
Rezvani et al  (2008) using deep sc injection of WT1 126-134 peptide in combination with PR1 169-177 
peptide using a different adjuvant observed induction of WT1- specific CD8+ T cells following 
sc injection of the 2 peptides. Subcutaneous dosing may have several advantages over id dosing 
including less injection site pain for patients and easier administration.  
4.2.4. Dosing Interval  
Cancer vaccines generally have a slow onset of efficacy, and efficacy requires a significant 
amount of CTL induction in accord with the amount of disease in advanced malignancies. The 
optimal dosing interval for cancer vaccine treatments is unknown. Based on preceding peptide 
vaccine clinical trials, 1  week is thought to be an appropriate initial dosing interval for a Phase 1 
trial.

Confidential and Propri etary 24 3 Dec 2014 4.3. Summary of Known Potential Risks and Benefits  
Treatment with other WT1 peptide vaccines, including some with the same sequence as the 
WT2725 peptide, in clinical trials has shown evidence of immunogenicity and clinical response 
in various malignancies. Based on the nonclinical findings for WT2725 and the reported clinical 
results with other WT1 peptide vaccines in cancer  patients there is an expectation that some 
clinical benefit may be derived from treatment with WT2725 Dosing Emulsion. In these clinical 
trials, as well as in the nonclinical studies of WT2725, there have been a limited number of 
significant adverse react ions other than local injection site skin reactions therefore presenting an 
acceptable benefit/risk profile to study participants.  
In this study at doses up to the RP2D of 9.0 mg, as of May  2014 the most common drug- related 
adverse reactions reported were low grade localized injection site reactions with itching, 
erythema, pain, bruising, and/or swelling. A total of 14 treatment -emergent SAEs were reported 
in 9 patients; there was no pattern in the types of treatment emergent SAEs reported. Two  SARs 
were reported in 2 patients; tumor necrosis was reported in 1  patient, and rash maculo-papular 
was reported in 1  patient. Further with the expanded RP2D patients, no important unanticipated 
risks, potential risks, or safety signals have been observed, the 9.0 mg dose is not considered the 
MTD. Preliminary review of efficacy data indicates that WT2725 Dosing Emulsion has the potential to be of benefit to patients, which may be further enhanced by more regular injections 
in the early stages of treatment. Based on th e results from these initial patients  in Part 1, 
additional dose escalation, at no more than double the prior dose level, is being explored to 
evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy. In addition, extension of the induction and 
consolidation phases of treatment will be explored.

6.1. Primary Endpoints  
The safety and tolerability of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be evaluated based on the 
occurrence of DLT and AEs, and the findings from clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, body weight measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.  
The determination of the MTD of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be based on the incidence of DLT at each dose level and the overall safety profile of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion. The incidence of DLT will be evaluated during the DLT Evaluation Period, which extends from the 
day of the first dose to just prior to the fifth dose of study drug (Days 1 to 29). No more than 
4 doses of study drug will be administered during the DLT Evaluation Period. 
Dose-limiting toxicities are defined as any Grade  3 or greater AE that occurs after the 
administration of study drug duri ng the DLT Evaluation Period that are not related to underlying 
disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications ( Changes in hematology parameters 
need to have been confirmed on repeat assessment  and constitute at least a 2  grade shift . Grade 3 
AEs of nausea, vomiting, and fatigue that are common and manageable in cancer patients will 
not be considered DLT if they can be ameliorated to  < Grade 3 with standard supportive care 
management. ). Adverse events will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.0 ( NCI-2009).

Confidential and Propri etary 28 3 Dec 2014 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  1, open-label, dose- escalation , 2-part study in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies known to overexpress the WT1 protein and who have progressive or recurrent 
measurable (may be measurable by tumor markers only, such as quantitative reverse 
transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction [RT -PCR] for WT1 transcript for AML, or cancer 
antigen 125 [CA-125] for ovarian carcinoma) neoplastic disease despite administration of 
standard therapy or for whom no standard of therapy exists. In Part 1 of the study patients with 
one of the following malignancies: non-small cell lung, ovarian, glioblast oma, and acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML; not including acute promyelocytic leukemia ) meeting the above criteria are 
eligible. In Part 2 of the study patients with glioblastoma  and AML (not including acute 
promyelocytic leukemia ) meeting the above criteria are eligible. 
Both parts of the study will primarily evaluate DLT and define the MTD of WT2725 Dosing 
Emulsion during the DLT Evaluation Period, which extends from the day of the first dose of 
study drug to just prior to the fifth dose (Days 1 - 29). Dose -limiting toxicities are defined as any 
Grade 3 or greater AE that occur s after the administration of study drug during the DLT 
Evaluation Period that are not related to underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications  (Changes in hematology parameters need to have been confirmed on repeat 
assessment  and constitute at least a 2  grade shift. Grade 3 AEs of nausea, vomiting, and fatigue 
that are common and manageable in cancer patients will not be considered DLT if they can be ameliorated to < Grade 3 with standard supportive care management.). In addition, antitumor 
activity and biomarkers indicative of immune response will be evaluated from the first dose until 
discontinuation of the patient from the study. An end of study assessment will take place within 
28 days after the last dose of study drug and prior to the start of al ternate antineoplastic therapy.  
The initial patients in each dose escalation cohort will be enrolled at least one week apart to 
evaluate initial safety from the first 2  patients, then a “rolling- six” design will be employed that 
allows accrual of 2  to 6 patients concurrently in each dose escalation cohort. This design was 
chosen in an effort to reduce the delays associated with patient accrual using the classical “3 + 3” 
design as severe immediate reactions are not anticipated following administration of WT2725 
Dosing Emulsion. The decision to enroll an additional patient in the current dose cohort, to dose 
escalate to the next dose cohort, or to dose de- escalate to  a lower dose cohort can be made 
without having to suspend enrollment following the initial enrollment of 3 patients, as in the 
“3 + 3” design. The decision regarding dose cohort for an incoming patient is dependent on the 
number of DLTs that have been observed, the number of patients enrolled at any time and the 
duration of their enrollment, and in Part 2 of the study the malignancy type . The goal remains to 
define the MTD as the dose level where no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT when 2 of 2 to 6 patients experiences a DLT at the next higher dose level. Meetings to review study execution and enrollment/dosing decisions will be held at least monthly between the sponsor, 
clinical sites, and the medical monitor. The expected time to enroll each dose escalation cohort 
(2 – 6 patients) is between 6 and 12 weeks.  
The following dose cohorts of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion are planned for Part 1 of the study: 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 29 3 Dec 2014 • 0.3, 0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg  
An approximate 3-fold increase in dose between cohorts (eg, 0.3, 0.9, 3.0 mg) will allow this  
dose range to be explored with the fewest number of dose levels. 
The following dose cohorts of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion are planned for Part 2 of the study: 
• 18.0 and 27.0 mg  
No more than a 2-fold increase in dose between cohorts (eg, 9.0, 18.0, 27.0 mg) will allow this 
higher dose range to be explored more conservatively . 
In Part 1 of the study, the 0.3 mg cohort will be conducted first. A fter safety and tolerability have 
been established for the first dose cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in subsequent cohorts and continue until the MTD or all planned cohorts are attained. Enrollment of each cohort may include patients with any of the eligible tumor types. 
Enrollment of the highest tolerable dose cohort (MTD or highest planned cohort) will continue 
until there are at least 6  patients total in the study with each tumor type that are evaluable for 
DLT, biomarkers, and response. This dose is considered the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 
Enrollment of up to 3 RP2D cohorts of 10 patients each of specific tumor types may take place at 
this dose in order to further characterize the safety and efficacy of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion at this dose in these subsets of patients. 
Additional dose escalation cohorts after the initial expansion cohort s may be enrolled if a MTD 
has not been determined and significant signs of toxicity have not been observed in the 
expansion cohorts. 
In Part 2 of the study, the 18.0 mg cohort will be conducted first. A fter safety and tolerability 
have been established for the 18.0 mg  cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be 
conducted sequentially in the 27.0 mg  cohort. Approximately 10 patient s at each dose level (18.0 
and 27.0 mg) with at least 4  patients with each malignancy type (glioblastoma and AML) will be 
enrolled at each of these dose levels.  If the MTD is reached in Part  2 before the total of 
20 patients are enrolled, remaining patients will be enrolled at the prior dose level.  Patients who 
experience DLT may  remain on the study at a reduced dose if they are deriving some therapeutic 
benefit from study drug and fulfill the criteria for study continuation for subsequent dosing (see 
Section 8.3.2); these decisions will be addressed on a case by case basis. Patients who experience 
a DLT or other significant toxicity at this reduced dose will be discontinued from receiving further study drug. In the event that a dose level is excluded from further study due to dose limiting toxicity all patients may continue the study at the most recently completed dose without 
DLT, eg, if the 27.0 mg dose is excluded due to DLT all patients may continue at 18.0 mg.  
After the DLT Evaluation Period, if a patient experiences a study drug -related Grade 3 toxicity, 
there will be a review of safety data to determine appropriate dosing for that patient and other 
patients on study, as well as for any subsequently enrolled patients. 
In the event that a Grade 4 or greater toxicity is reported at any time during the study, the 
sponsor and the investigator will conduct a thorough evaluation of the available safety data to 
decide whether to continue enrolling new patients into the study. 
Patients who have completed the consolidation phase of their assigned cohort and have not 
experienced a D LT, ≥ Grade 2 study drug- related injection -site reaction, or required a dose 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 30 3 Dec 2014 reduction may have their dose level escalated to that of the highest cohort for which safety and 
tolerability have been established. Patient s may remain on study drug until evidence of 
confirmed progressive disease, intolerance to study drug, or fulfillment of any of the other criteria for discontinuation (see Section 12.2). 
Each part of t he study will include 3  treatment phases based on intended timing of study drug 
dosing as indicated below: 
Part 1: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 4  weeks (doses  1 - 5) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 6  weeks (doses 6 - 9) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 10 and thereafter) 
Part 2: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 8 weeks (doses 1 - 9) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 1 0 weeks (doses 10 – 15 [maximum 
6 doses]) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 16 and thereafter) 
Approximately 60 to 80 patients total including replacements will be dosed in this clinical trial. 
The total number of patients dosed in this clinical trial will be deter mined by the number of 
patients treated in each dose cohort and the number of dose cohorts necessary to determine the 
MTD, as well as the number of RP2D cohorts enrolled. If all 4  dose escalation cohorts are 
necessary  in Part 1, and if 6 enrolled patients are required in each dose escalation cohort and/or 
tumor type, then 24 patients evaluable for DLT, biomarkers, and response would be necessary in the Part 1 dose escalation . In addition, up to 30 patients may be enrolled in the RP2D cohorts in 
Part 1. If both dose escalation cohorts are necessary in Part  2, and if 10 patients are enrolled in 
each of these cohorts, then 20 patients will be enrolled in Part 2. Patients who discontinue from the study prior to completion of the DLT, biomarker response evaluatio n period will be replaced 
likely increasing the total number of patients enrolled .  
Four to 8 investigative sites in the United States (US) will be utilized to enroll patients  in Part 1 
of the study. An additional 2 sites in the US  may be opened to enroll patient s in Part 2.

m Evaluation should be made on the planned dosing  day, prior to study drug administration.  
n Evaluation should be approximately 48 hours (but no sooner than 24 hours) after the DTH skin test injection.  
o Samples obtained 6 hours (± 30 minutes) and 48 hours (± 6 hours) postdose.  
p In place of tumor tissue samples from a biopsy during screening, archived tumor tissue samples may be provided. Availability of tumor tissue samples should be determined 
during screening through provision of the accession number or other identification num ber. If necessary, the tumor tissue sample b iopsy should be performed after study 
eligibility has been confirmed and before the first dose of study drug. The tumor tissue samples will only be provided to the  sponsor for patients who receive study drug. In place 
of archival tumor tissue samples, patients with AML should have available a bone marrow aspirate and/or bone marrow biopsy  with PCR for WT1 transcript performed before 
the first dose of study drug.  Patients with AML should also have peripheral blood assessed for blasts and WT1 transcript.  
q IHC need not be performed for patients with AML provided RT -PCR for WT1 transcript is assessed.  
r Tumor assessments (per irRC for solid tumors, modified IWG for AML, and/or standard tumor markers as appropriate , and quantitative RT -PCR for WT1 transcript for AML) 
are not required to be repeated if they have been performed within the 28  days before first dose (there are no variations allowed beyond this window). If multiple assessments are 
available, the most recent ones should be used as the baseline result. Data from at least one additional historical assessment  prior to the baseline assessment  should also be 
provided, if available. Progressive disease requires confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment at least 4  weeks after the date of first documentation, unless rapid clinical 
deterioration is seen. For patients with glioblastoma , progressive disease should additionally be confirmed by SPECT, perfusion MRI, MRI spectroscopy or C -14 methionine 
PET or pathology from available surgical/biopsy specimens  to differentiate from pseudoprogression. For patients with AML, bone marrow aspirations/biopsies are to be

Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 45 3 Dec 2014 The initial patients in each dose escalation cohort will be enrolled at least one week apart to 
evaluate initial safety from the first 2  patients; after which, if initial acceptable safety has been 
observed, there is no requirement to w ait between enrolling indiv idual patients within a cohort. 
After completion of DLT evaluation for the first dose cohort, if the study continues, enrollment 
of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in subsequent dose escalation cohorts and 
continue until the MTD or all planned cohorts are attained in the dose escalation part s of the 
study. 
The 0.3 mg dose cohort will be conducted first in Part 1. If after 3  patients in this dose cohort 
have completed the DLT Evaluation Period and there are n o DLTs identified, enrollment of the 
subsequent cohort will begin. If additional patients are ready to enroll in the study prior to 
completion of the DLT Evaluation Period for the first 3 patients in the 0.3 mg dose cohort, up to 
3 more patients may be enrolled in that cohort. 
Again, in subsequent dose escalation cohorts in Part  1, if 3 patients in a dose cohort complete the 
DLT Evaluation Period and there are no DLTs identified, then the dose level is increased, otherwise enrollment of additional patients (up to 3 more) may be permitted in the same cohort. 
If one of 3 patients in a dose escalation cohort experiences a DLT then up to a total of 6 patients 
are enrolled in the same dose cohort and dose escalation may only proceed if no additional patients experience DLT. Patients not evaluable for DLT assessment may be replaced.  
In Part 2 of the study, the 18.0 mg cohort will be conducted first. I f 3 patients in the dose cohort 
complete the DLT Evaluation Period and there are no DLTs identified, then the 27.0 mg dose 
cohort may begin, otherwise enrollment of additional patients (up to 3 more) may be permitted in 
the same cohort.  If one of 3 patients in a dose escalation cohort experiences a DLT then up to a 
total of 6 patients are enrolled in the same dose cohort and dose escalation may only proceed if 
no additional patients experience DLT. A fter safety and tolerability have been established for the 
18.0 mg cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in the 27.0 mg  
cohort. If additional patients are ready to enroll in the study prior to completion of the DLT 
Evaluation Period for the 27.0 mg dose cohort, up to a total of 10 patients may be enrolled at the 
18.0 mg dose level. Approximately 10 patien ts at each dose level (18.0 and 27.0 mg) with at 
least 4 patients with each malignancy type (glioblastoma and AML ) will be enrolled. If the MTD 
is reached in Part  2 before the total of 20 patients are enrolled, remaining patients will be 
enrolled at the prior dose level. Patients not evalu able for DLT assessment may be replaced.  
If at any time during dose escalation  2 or more patients experience DLT within a dose cohort that 
suggests that the MTD has been exceeded; no additional patients will be enrolled into that dose cohort and dose escalation will end. The MTD will be the dose level below that which resulted in 
2 or more patients experiencing a DLT. If the suspected MTD is based on a cohort in which 
fewer than 6 patients were enrolled then additional patients will be enrolled and tre ated at that 
dose level until there is a total of 6  patients evaluable for DLT within that dose escalation cohort. 
In the event that a dose level is excluded from further study due to dose limiting toxicity all patients may continue the study at the most r ecently completed dose without DLT, eg, if the 
27.0 mg dose is excluded due to DLT all patients may continue at 18.0 mg.  
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 46 3 Dec 2014 7.2.1. Criteria for Dose -limiting Toxicity   
Dose-limiting toxicities are defined as any Grade  3 or greater AE that occurs after the 
administra tion of study drug during the DLT Evaluation Period that are not related  to underlying 
disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications  (Changes in hematology parameters 
need to have been  confirmed on repeat assessment  and constitute a t least a 2 grade shift . Grade 3 
AEs of nausea, vomiting, and fatigue that are common and manageable in cancer patients will 
not be considered DLT if they can be ameliorated to  < Grade 3 with standard supportive care 
management.).  
The DLT Evaluation Period extends from the day of the first dose of study drug to just prior to the fifth dose (Days 1 - 29). No more than 4 doses of study drug will be administered during the 
DLT Evaluation Period. 
In a dose cohort with less than 2 patients with DLT, a minimum of 3  evaluable patients are 
needed to assess dose level escalation. An evaluable patient is defined as a patient who has a 
DLT or a patient who completes the DLT Evaluation Period w ithout the occurrence of a DLT.  
Patients who discontinue from the study for a reason other than DLT prior to completion of the 
DLT Evaluation Period are not evaluable for DLT and will be replaced. 
7.2.2. Reporting of Dose-limiting Toxicity or Completion of DLT Evaluation Period 
If a DLT occurs,  the investigator or his designee must complete the DLT form with the requested 
information describing the DLT and fax or email the form to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. or 
its agent within 1  business day of becoming aware of the DLT. 
When a patient completes the DLT Evaluation Period, the investigator or his designee must 
complete the DLT form to confirm no DLT has occurred and fax or email the form to Sunovion 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. or its agent within 1 business day of the patient completing the DLT 
Evaluation Period. 
The DLT form will be provided as a part of the document package necessary to conduct this 
clinical study.  
7.3. Dose-Level Escalation Stopping Criteria  
The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT when 
2 of 2 to 6 patients experiences a DLT at the next higher dose level.  
Part 1 
Dose level escalation will be completed when the MTD has been determined or the minimum number of patients has been enrolled at the highest planned dose level to meet dose escalation or 
MTD criteria (2 -6 patients).  
Additional dose escalation cohorts after the initial expansion cohort s may be enrolled if a MTD 
has not been determined and significant signs of toxicity have not been observed in the expansion cohorts. 
Part 2 
Dose level escalation will be completed when 20 patients have been enrolled. 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 47 3 Dec 2014 7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
The following sections provide guidelines for intra-patient dose adjustment. Dose level 
escalation among cohorts of patients is described in Section  7.2. 
7.4.1. Dose Reduction Criteria  
The following guidelines are provided for dose level reductions: 
• Dose reduction from the lowest dose level (0.3 mg)  is not permitted at any time.  
• Patients who experience DLT may remain on the study at a reduced dose , if they are 
deriving some therapeutic benefit from study drug and meet the continuation criteria for subsequent dosing (see Section  8.3.2). These decisions will be addressed on a case 
by case basis. The dose will be reduced one level, eg, from 0.9 to 0.3 mg. Patients 
who require reduction from this reduced dose will be discontinued from receiving further study drug.  
After the DLT Evaluation Period, if a patient experiences a study drug -related Grade 3 toxicity, 
there will be a review of safety data to determine appropriate dosing for that patient and other 
patients on study, as well as for any subsequently enrolled patients. 
In the event that a Grade 4 or greater toxicity is reported during the study, the sponsor and the 
investigator will conduct a thorough evaluation of the available safety data to de cide whether to 
continue enrolling new patients into the study. 
Dose delays are described in Section 8.3.2. 
7.4.2. Dose Increases  
Patients who have completed the consolidation phase of their assigned cohort and have not 
experienced a DLT, ≥  Grade 2 study drug- related injection -site reaction, or required a dose 
reduction may have their dose escalated to that of the highest cohort for which safety and 
tolerability have been established.  This includes patients from Part 1 of the study having their 
dose escalated to a Part  2 dose. 
7.5. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of patients who withdraw consent prior to completion of the 
DLT Evaluat ion Period, the number of assessments has been limited to those required to collect 
the information needed to address the objectives of the study.  
7.6. Study Termination Criteria  
The study may be terminated at any time by the sponsor for any reason.

10.5. Study Drug Administration  
All open- label study drug will be administered at the study site by trained staff.  
In Part 1 of the study, a fter safety and tolerability have been establish ed for the 0.3 mg dose 
cohort (following completion of DLT Evaluation Period), enrollment of subsequent patients will 
be conducted sequentially in subsequent dose escalation cohorts and continue until the MTD or 
all planned cohorts are attained. This dose is considered the RP2D, and subsequent patients 
enrolled will initiate treatment at this dose.  Additional dose escalation cohorts aft er the initial 
expansion cohort s may be enrolled if a MTD has not been determined and significant signs of 
toxicity have not been observed in the expansion cohorts. In Part 2 of the study, the 18.0 mg 
cohort will be conducted first. A fter safety and tolerability have been established for the 18.0 mg 
cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in the 27.0 mg  cohort. If 
additional patients are ready to enroll in the study prior to completion of the DLT Evaluation Period for the 27.0 mg dose cohort, up to a total of 10 patients may be enr olled at the 18.0 mg 
dose level . 
Each dose of study drug will be administered using 2 injection sites ( eg, 0.3 mL/site  x 2 for the 
9.0 mg dose). The only restriction on the dosing site is that the forearm used for the DTH skin 
tests should not be used for administration of study drug. Wherever possible, injections should be administered into the area surrounding the regional lymph nodes in the upper arm, the lower 
abdomen, or the femoral area. Rotation of injection sites is permitted. Injection sites should not 
be chosen in the area of any ongoing skin condition, eg, a rea of psoriasis.  
Each part of the study will include 3 treatment phases based on intended timing of study drug 
dosing as indicated below: 
Part 1: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 4  weeks (doses  1 - 5) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 6 weeks (doses 6 - 9) 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 61 3 Dec 2014 • Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (doses 10 and 
thereafter)  
Part 2: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 8 weeks (doses 1 - 9) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 1 0 weeks (doses 10 – 15 [ maximum 
6 doses]) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 16 and thereafter ) 
10.5.1. Assignment of Dose Cohort for Each Patient 
The following steps will be followed to assign the dose cohort for each patient in the study. 
• Once the clinical site has identified a patient for the study, before screening begins, 
the Investigator or his designee must complete the Pre- screening log and fax or email 
the form to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. or its agent. 
• When a patient completes Screening,  the Investigator or his designee must complete 
the Study Registration form and fax or email the form to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. or its agent. 
• Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. or its agent will provide authorization to enroll a 
patient by providing information regarding the appropriate dose cohort and then the 
clinical site will complete the Registration form to confirm assigned dose cohort and planned date of first dose and fax or email the form to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
or its agent 
The Registration form will be provided as a part of the document package necessary to conduct 
this clinical study.  
10.5.2. Selection of Dose Cohort for Each Patient  
The selection of dose cohort for each patient during the dose escalation of P art 1 of the study is 
made based on the number of DLTs, if any, that have been observed in the current dose cohort, 
the number of patients enrolled in the current dose cohort, and the duration of their enrollment 
(eg, whether the DLT Evaluation Period is complete). After the RP2D is determined  in Part 1 of 
the study, subsequent patients enrolled in Part  1 will initiate treatment at this dose. Selection of 
dose cohort for patients in Part 2 of the study is made based on the number of DLTs, if any, that have been observed in the current dose cohort, the number of patients enrolled in the current 
dose cohort, and the duration of their enrollment (eg, whether the DLT Evaluation Period is complete).  
Upon receipt of the Study Registration form for a patient, a review of available enrollment information and occurrence of DLTs, if any, will be conducted to decide the appropria te dose 
cohort for the patient. 
Meetings to review study execution and enrollment/dosing decisions will be held at least 
monthly between the sponsor, clinical sites, and the medical monitor.  Instructions regarding 
intra-patient dose changes are described in Section 7.4.2.

Confidential and Proprietary 63 3 Dec 2014 11. TREATMENT PLAN  
11.1. Study Assessments  
11.1.1. Safety 
Safety assessments will be conducted at each study visit as indicated on the Schedules of 
Assessments ( Tables 3 - 6) and will include the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical 
examinations, determinations of vital signs, body weight measurements, ECGs, and clinical 
laboratory determinations including complete blood count, serum chemistries, and urinalysis. 
Careful monitoring for signs of local injection site reactions will be performed during the study. 
In addition, these assessments will be used to describe the DLT and determine the MTD. The 
definition of DLT is provided in Section  7.2.1 and the determination of MTD is discussed in 
Section 7.3. 
11.1.2. Efficacy 
Tumor response will be evaluated according to the irRC ( Wolchok-2009, Hoos-2010), modified 
IWG based on Cheson-2003, and/or tumor markers, as appropriate for the diagnosis. An 
evaluable patient for response is defined as a patient who has had at least one tumor assessmen t 
conducted 8 weeks after the first dose of study drug or a patient who has progressive disease prior to this time point.  
Survival also will be assessed. 
11.1.2.1. Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC)  
The irRC was chosen because immunotherapeutic agents produce a ntitumor effects by inducing 
an immune response specific to cancer cells or by modifying native immune processes that can 
result in clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or the appearance of new lesions, which is unique from cytotoxic agents.  
The use of radiographic procedures, physical examinations, and measurement of tumor markers for evaluation of response will be performed based on the presence of known areas of disease and current symptoms. Unless there are compelling reasons othe rwise, the tumor assessments 
during the study will be conducted under the same conditions (eg, slice thickness, use of a contrast agent, etc) and using the same examination method (eg, CT, MRI) as used for the pretreatment assessment.  
Tumor assessments will be conducted during screening, and then every 8 weeks after the first 
dose of study drug, unless clinical indications require more frequent assessment. Tumor assessments are first conducted after 8  weeks to allow adequate time for immune activation an d 
consequent antitumor responses. All tumor assessments performed on the day of study drug administration must be completed before study drug is administered.  
Tumor response is based on total measurable tumor burden. For the irRC, index and measurable 
new lesions are taken into account. A measurable lesion is defined as 5 × 5 mm or more on 
helical CT scan.  
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 64 3 Dec 2014 At the pretreatment tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the 2 largest perpendicular 
diameters (SPD) of all index lesions (5  lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions, and 
5 cutaneous index lesions) is calculated.  
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable lesions (≥ 5 × 5 mm; up to 5  new lesions per organ; 5 new cutaneous lesions; and 10 visceral 
lesions) are added together to provide the total tumor burden: 
Tumor Burden = SPD
index lesions  + SPD new, measurable lesions  
Percentage changes in tumor burden per assessment time point describe the size and growth of 
both baseline and new, measurable lesions as they appear. At each tumor assessment, the 
response in index and new, measurable lesions is defined based on the change in tumor burden (after ruling out immune -related progressive disease [irPD]). Decreases in tumor burden must be 
assessed relative to  pretreatment measurements (ie, the SPD of all index lesions at screening).  
Overall response will be determined by the investigator according to the irRC response assessments based on tumor burden as follows: 
• irCR (immune -related complete response)  = complete disappearance of all lesions 
(whether measurable or not, and no new lesions) confirmation by a repeat, 
consecutive assessment 6 weeks after the date of first documentation  
•  irPR (immune -related partial response)  = decrease in tumor burden ≥ 50% relative to 
baseline confirmed by a consecutive assessment 6  weeks after the date of first 
documentation 
• irSD (immune -related stable disease)  = not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR and the 
absence of irPD  
• irPD (immune -related progressive disease)  = increase in tumor burden ≥ 25% relative 
to nadir (prior minimum recorded tumor burden during the study) confirmation by a 
repeat, consecutive assessment at least 4  weeks after the date of first documentation  
Note: For patients  with glioblastoma, measurements should include enhancing tumor only, 
nonenhancing lesions (T2/FLAIR) should be recorded as improved, stable, or significant increase. 
Note: For patients with glioblastoma, progressive disease should additionally be confirme d by 
single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT), perfusion MRI, MRI spectroscopy or 
C-14 methionine positron-emission tomography ( PET) or pathology from available 
surgical/biopsy specimens  to differentiate from pseudoprogression. For patients with ovarian 
cancer that express CA -125, progressive disease should additionally be confirmed by CA-125 
(≥ 2x higher of ULN or on study nadir). 
Note: For irPD confirmation, follow-up with observation alone (during the weeks before 
confirmation) may not be appropriate for patients with a rapid decline in ECOG performance 
status or other signs of rapid clinical deterioration. The investigator should use his best judgment in determining if sooner tumor assessment is required in these patients. 
Note: Patients with progressive disease based on tumor assessments who are experiencing 
clinical benefit in the investigator’s opinion may continue on study and undergo repeat tumor 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 65 3 Dec 2014 assessments. If subsequent stabilization or improvement is observed the patient may continue in 
the study. 
11.1.2.2. Modified International Working Group response criteria in acute myeloid 
leukemia (IWG)  
The modified International Working Group (IWG) response criteria were developed to assess the 
activity of drugs in AM L. The criteria are as follows:  
• Complete remission (CR): 
• Morphologic CR 
< 5% Marrow blasts in an aspirate with spicules – patient independent of 
transfusions 
 Absolute neutrophil count > 1000/μL 
 Platelets >  100,000/μL 
 No residual evidence of extramedullary disease  
• Cytogenetic CR - cytogenetics normal (in patients with previously abnormal 
cytogenetics)  
• Molecular CR - molecular studies negative  
• CRi - < 5% marrow blasts but with persistence of cytopenias (ie , absolute neutrophil 
count < 1000 /μ L and/or platele ts < 100,000/μ L) 
• Morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) - bone marrow blasts < 5%  
• Partial remission: 
Decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5%  to 25% in the bone 
marrow aspirate and the normalization of blood counts, as noted above. 
• PRi:  
Decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5%  to 25% in the bone 
marrow aspirate but with  persistence of cytopenias (ie, absolute neutrophil count 
< 1000/μL and/or platelets < 100,000/μL ). 
Measurable disease will be defined as > 5% marrow blas ts. 
Relapse following complete remission is defined as reappearance of leukemic blasts in the 
peripheral blood or the finding of more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attributable to 
another cause, or extramedullary relapse.  
Progressive disease will be defined as  increase of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts in the 
bone marrow aspirate with an increase of at least 10  percent of blasts in the bone marrow 
aspirate. 
11.1.2.3. Tumor Markers  
Tumor markers may be utilized to assess response as appropriate for the diagnosis. This  should 
include at least  quantitative RT-PCR for WT1 transcript in blood or bone marrow for patients 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 66 3 Dec 2014 with AML, and serum CA -125 for patients with ovarian carcinoma. Measurable disease may be 
determined by markers alone as defined by individual laboratory normal ranges. Response will 
be quantified by the fractional decrease on treatment.  Tumor markers drawn from peripheral 
blood samples should be assessed at least every 4 weeks after the first dose but may be 
performed more frequently. 
11.1.3. Other 
Biomarker analyses will be conducted as indicated on the Schedules of Assessments 
(Tables 3 - 6). An evaluable patient for biomarkers is defined as a patient who has had the 
Day 29 biomarker assessments completed. Directions for the handling and processing of 
biomarker samples are provided in a separate manual.  
Peripheral blood samples will be obtained for evaluation of WT1 peptide-specific CTL induction activity by tetramer assay, and W T1 serum antibody titer by enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assay [ELISA], and for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for exploratory biomarker analyses. In addition, blood samples will be obtained and blood serum archived for possible analyses of other biomarkers, such as protein and microRNA, that may be important to 
the understanding of WT2725 but which have not yet been selected. Providing informed consent 
for use of this sample for pharmacogenetic purposes is optional, and participation in the study is not dependent upon providing this sample. 
Delayed-type hypersensitivity to the WT2725 peptide will be measured approximately 48 hours 
(but no sooner than 24 hours) after id inoculation with WT2725 in diluted WT2725 Injection for 
DTH skin t ests. The site of diluted WT2725 Injection inoculation will be compared to the site of 
inoculation with the negative control (DSWI). The criteria for evaluation include injection site erythema diameter and quality (eg, redness, induration, ulceration, etc ). Directions for 
conducting and evaluating DTH skin tests are provided in Appendix VII. 
Immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue will be evaluated by expression of CD8+, Foxp3, HLA 
class I, and WT1 protein using tumor tissue samples obtained before the first dose and after the 
last dose of study drug. In place of tumor tissue samples from biopsy during screening, archived 
tumor tissue samples may be provided. Biopsy for tumor tissue samples after the last dose of 
study drug is not mandatory and refusal to consent to post- treatment biopsy samples will not 
exclude a patient from enrollment in the study. IHC need not be performed for patients with 
AML provided RT- PCR for WT1 transcript is assessed.  
11.2. Standardization of Data Capture  
Study Schematic and Schedule of As sessments:  For Part 1 of the study a schematic of the 
study design is presented in Figure  1 and a summary of assessments to be conducted at each visit 
are presented in Table 3, Schedule of Assessments for Screening and Vaccine Induction Phase

Confidential and Proprietary 67 3 Dec 2014 Vital Signs: Vital signs following 5  minutes of seated rest, will consist of supine systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures, respiration rate, pulse, and oral body temperature. If possible, the same 
arm should be used during each assessment of blood pressure and pulse throughout the study. 
Vital signs will be obtained prior to collection of clinical laboratory samples and performance of an ECG. 
Weight and height:  Weight and height should be measured in street clothing with no shoes. 
Centrally-read ECG: All ECGs will be obtained in the supine position, after the patient has 
been resting supine for at least 10  minutes. ECGs will be 12 -lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. 
ECGs should be obtained prior to drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the same ECG recorder for all visits within individual patients. ECGs will be centrally read at a core lab according to established quality assurance procedures for inter/intra reader variability. Refer 
to Appendix I  for additional information. 
Clinical Laboratory: For detailed instructions regarding laboratory procedures, sampling, and 
shipping guidelines refer to the site and local laboratory guidelines. Samples will be processed at 
a local laboratory. All laboratories will be College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (or equivalent) certified. See Appendix IV for a 
list of required clinical laboratory tests.  
Adverse Events: As a discussion guide, patients should be queried in a non-leading manner, 
without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since your last visit?”). See Appendix VIII  for definitions used in reporting AEs. 
Concomitant Medications and Medical History:  Patient self -report will be acceptable for 
listing all concomitant medication use, medical history, and evaluation for inclusion/exclusion except where specific protocol procedures are mandated to ensure appropriate enrollment (eg, 
certain baseline lab values).

Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 86 3 Dec 2014 13. ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING  
13.1. Adverse Events  
An AE is any new, untoward medical occurrence or worseni ng of a pre -existing medical 
condition that occurs during study participation, whether or not the event is considered drug 
related. 
AEs will be collected from the time the informed consent is signed through the end of the study. Serious adverse events will  be collected and reported on the SAE form, from the time of 
informed consent through 30 days post last dose and will be followed until resolution or lost to 
follow-up. SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent through the end of study must be 
recorded on the CRF and the data recorded should match that on the SAE form. 
Non-leading questions will be used to ask patients about the possible occurrence of AEs. The 
Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by the Investigator to be related 
or unrelated to the study drug, must be documented in the patient’s study records/source documents, in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the AE page of 
the CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity according to the CTCAE V.4.0, 
seriousness, and causal relationship to the study medication. Appendix VIII (Definitions for 
Reporting Adverse Events) provides definitions for relationship to study medication, and action 
taken, and reference to CTCAE for grade. An AE is deemed associated wit h the use of the study 
drug “if there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by  the drug” 
(21 CFR 312.32 [a]). 
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact person for protocol related questions or discussion of 
AEs. The contact information for the Medical Monitor as well as other emergency contact information can be found on page 3 of this protocol. 
13.2. Objective Findings 
New and worsening signs and symptoms of underlying or emerging disease must be recorded as AEs. Clinically signif icant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG 
value, and physical examination observation) will also be recorded on the Adverse Event page of 
the CRF from signing of the informed consent onwards. When a clear diagnosis is available that 
explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a 
definite diagnosis is not available, then the sign (e g, clinically significant elevation of 
transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) will be recorded as the AE. 
Progression of the malignancy being treated in the study is not reported as an AE. 
Hospitalization due solely to progression of the malignancy being treated in the study is not an 
SAE. Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs if the symptoms cannot be 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 87 3 Dec 2014 determined as exclusively due to the malignancy being treated in the study, or if they do not fit 
the expected pattern of pro gression for the malignancy being treated in the study. 
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by an Investigator as they become available. Possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality must be 
repeated. Any  abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Laboratory reports, as appropriate when an electronic medical records system is not used, will be initialed and dated on all pages by a Form FDA 1572- listed Investigato r. 
All on-site ECG tracings and ECG over -read reports will be reviewed by an Investigator as they 
become available. The Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG interpretations on the machine read tracing. Possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal 
ECGs of uncertain causality must be repeated. Any abnormal ECGs that persist should be 
followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings, as necessary when an electronic 
system is not used, will be initialed and dated on all pages by a Form FDA 1572- listed 
Investigator. 
13.3. Immediately Reportable Events  
There are 2  categories of medical events that could occur during participation in a clinical study 
that must be immediately reported to Sunovion Pha rmaceuticals Inc. or its agent: 
• SAE, including death. 
• The incidence of pregnancy. 
PPD Pharmacovigilance (PVG) must be contacted immediately upon first knowledge of the 
incident. 
PPD PVG: 
Phone hotline: (919) 456-6001 
Fax: (919) 654-0211 
Email: Sunovionsafety@druginfo .com 
Emergency contact information can also be found on page 3 of this protocol. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-t hreatening AE, 
in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (Hospitalization due solely 
to progression of the malignancy being treated in the study is not an SAE.), a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 88 3 Dec 2014 Life-threatening means that the patient was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form might have caused death.  
If an Investigator or study site staff becomes aware of a SAE that occurs in a study patient from 
the time that inf ormed consent is signed through 30 days following the last dose of study 
medication, this must be reported immediately to PPD PVG. 
In addition to the initial telephone notification, an initial SAE form as applicable must be completed and sent via fax to PPD PVG within 1  business day of an Investigator or study site 
staff becoming aware of the event. Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. provides the SAE form used to report SAEs as a part of the document package necessary to conduct this clinical study. 
Sunovion Pha rmaceuticals Inc. will promptly notify all research sites of an AE that is determined 
to be reportable to the Regulatory Authorities. These AEs must be promptly reported to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) by the Principal Investigator. 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she will be instructed to 
immediately stop taking study medication. Further, the patient will be instructed to return within 
48 hours of the first notification of pregnancy to the research site and undergo a serum pregnancy test, as confirmation of pregnancy. If positive, the patient will no longer receive any additional 
study medication and will continue to be followed. All pregnancies, whether or not the patient 
received any study medication, will be followed  until resolution (ie, termination [voluntary or 
spontaneous] or birth). 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregnancy Event Form must be completed and sent via facsimile to 
PPD PVG within 1  business day of first knowledge by the research personnel of the pregnancy. 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. provides the Pregnancy Event Form as a part of the document 
package necessary to conduct this clinical study. Pregnancies occurring from the time the 
informed consent is signed through 30 days following the last dose of study medication will be followed quarterly until birth or termination of the pregna ncy. 
If a pregnancy is reported for a male study patient’s partner, the Sponsor’s representative will provide instructions on how to collect pregnancy information in accordance with local requirements. Proper consent to collect the partner’s information will be obtained prior to the 
collection of any information.

Confidential and Proprietary 90 3 Dec 2014 be administered study drug in clinic, and all recorded exposure or compliance information will 
listed by patient.  
14.5.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important Protocol Deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of potentially IPD s. The potential IPDs will be identified through programmatic checks of study 
data, as well as through review of selected data listings. The potential IPDs to be reviewed 
include, but are not limited to, patients who: 
• Did not meet inclusion/exclusion or continuation criteria  
• Received any disallowed concomitant medication or therapy  
The number of patients with each type of IPD  will be tabulated by category and by deviation 
type for all patients in the Safety population by dose cohort. Individual IPDs will be presented in 
a data listing.  
14.5.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics

Safety measures w ill be summarized using descriptive statistics generally by enrolled dose 
cohort and listed for each patient.  
14.5.7.1. DLT and Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA, version 14.0 or higher. 
The occurrence of DLT events during the DLT evaluation period w ill be summarized for each 
dose cohort. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as: 
• AEs that occurred on or after the first dose of study drug and on or before the 30th day 
after the last do se of study drug, 
• AEs with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug, 
or 
• AEs with both a missing start and stop date.  
TEAEs will be summarized by dose cohort and ov erall and by MedDRA SOC and PT.  
The following AEs will be summarized and presented by enrolled dose cohort and by MedDRA 
SOC and PT for the Safety population: 
• All TEAEs (including number of events and patient incidence) 
• TEAEs by relationship to treatment (unrelated, or related)  
• TEAEs by CTCAE Grade  
Similar summaries will be presented by the last dose receive d before the start of the event. 
The following conventions will be followed in summarizing AEs: 
• For patient incidence summaries, each patient will be counted only once within each 
SOC and within each PT. 
• If a patient reports more than one AE within a PT and/or a SOC, the AE with the 
highest known grade within each SOC and within each PT will be included in the 
summaries by grade.  
• For summaries by relationship to study medication, AEs whose relationship to treatment is assessed as “not related” will be grouped as “unrelated.” AEs assessed as 
“possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” unknown or missing will be grouped as 
“related.” If a patient reports more than one AE within the same treatment regimen, 
SOC and PT, and any are related, it  will be summarized as re lated. 
A listing of all TEAEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation or death, will be presented. A 
separate listing for non- treatment -emergent AEs will also be provided. 
14.5.7.2. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
For laboratory parameters with continuous outcomes , descriptive statistics will be presented for 
each dose cohort and within each tumor group at each time point. Changes from baseline will be 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 92 3 Dec 2014 summarized in the same manner.  For laboratory parameters with categorical outcomes, the 
number of patients  with each outcome will be presented. The data listings for laboratory 
parameters will flag values outside of the reference range.  
14.5.7.3. Electrocardiograms  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be used to collect and record electrocardiographic data according to 
the schedule of assessments. Parameters to be collected include ventricular heart rate, QT 
interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and RR interval (ms). The corrected QT interval will be 
derived according to the Fridericia formula (QT c–F = QT/[R-R/1000]1/3) as well as  Bazett’s 
formula (QT c–B = QT/[R-R/1000]1/2). 
ECG parameters and changes in these parameters from predose Day  1, as determined by the 
central over -read, will be summarized using descriptive statistics at eac h time point by dose 
cohort. 
The number of patients with QT c-F values in the following categories will be summarized: 
• QTc-F ≥ 500 ms at any postdose time point and not present at baseline 
• QTc-F ≥ 450 ms at any postdose time point and not present at baseline 
• Change from baseline in QT c-F ≥ 60 ms for at least 1 postdose measurement 
• Change from baseline in QT c-F ≥ 30 ms for at least 1  postdose measurement, but 
< 60 ms for all postdose measurements 
Any unscheduled ECG that occurs after first dose will be included for these post- treatment 
summaries.  
The above categorical analyses will also be performed for QT c-B. 
A listing of  patients with over- read ECG abnormalities including overall, rhythm, conduction, 
morphology, myocardial infarction, and the presence of ST, T, and U wave abnormalities will be 
presented . 
14.5.7.4. Vital Signs  
Body temperature, respiration rate, pulse, blood pressure (diastolic and systolic), and weight will be summarized using descriptive statistics at each time point by dose cohort. Changes from baseline will be  summarized in the same manner.  
14.5.7.5. Physical Examination 
Findings from the physical examinations will be presented as follows: pre -existing clinically 
significant conditions recorded as medical history will be summarized as described in Section 14.5.4, any new clinically significant conditions recorded as AEs will be summarized as 
described in Section  14.5.7.1. 
14.5.7.6. Concomitant Medications  
Other than the study drug, any medication taken by patients during the course of the study with a start date or an end date on or after the date of the first dose of study drug, or marked as ongoing, 
will be considered concomitant. Medications stopped prior to the date of the first dose of study 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 93 3 Dec 2014 drug will not be considered concomitant. The number of patients using each concomitant 
medication will be summarized for each  treatment according to the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary (WHODRUG) Anatomic Therapeutic Class (ATC) class and PT. Patients with multiple uses of a concomitant medication during a treatment period will be counted once for a given ATC and PT for the treatment period.  
14.5.8. Treatment of Missing Data  
For analyses of change from baseline, baseline will generally be defined as the predose assessment on Day  1 or during screening as scheduled. If this value is unavailable, the last 
non-missing value prior to the first dose of study drug will be used. Otherwise, missing 
observations will be treated as missing at random, and no data imputation will be performed.

the research protocol, informed consent form, and any advertisement for patient recruitment, 
from an IRB or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) complying with the provisions specified in 
21 CFR Part  56 or in ICH GCP, as applicable, and applicable pertinent government regulations. 
The Investigator must assure IRB or IEC compliance with the applicable regulations. 
A copy of written IRB or IEC approval or favorable opinion of the protocol, informed consent 
form and advertising (if applicable) must be provided to CRO/Sponsor prior to initiation of the 
study. The approval or favorable opinion letter must be signed by the IRB or I EC chairman or 
designee, identify the IRB/IEC name and address, identify the clinical protocol by title and/or 
protocol number, and include the date that approval or favorable opinion was granted. The letter 
must also contain a statement that the IRB or IEC complies with the requirements in 21  CFR 
Part 56 for a study conducted under an IND or ICH GCP, as applicable. 
The Investigator/CRO is responsible for obtaining continued review of the clinical research or submitting periodic progress reports, in accordance with applicable regulations, at intervals not 
exceeding one year or otherwise specified by the IRB or IEC. The Sponsor must be supplied with written documentation of continued review of the clinical research. 
The Investigator must promptly inform their IRB/IEC of all SAEs or other safety information 
reported from CRO/Sponsor in accordance with 21 CFR  312.66, or when dictated by applicable 
local regulations (ie, Directive  2001/20/EC), the Sponsor/CRO is responsible for reporting to the 
IEC (eg, reporting of serious AEs).  
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 96 3 Dec 2014 16.3. Informed Consent  
The Investigator will prepare the informed consent form and provide the form to CRO/Sponsor 
for approval prior to submission to the IRB or IEC. CRO/Sponsor may provide a template 
informed consent form to be qualified by e ach research facility to conform to local requirements. 
All informed consent forms must contain the minimum elements as mandated by the FDA or 
governing regulatory authority and ICH guidelines and will be subject to CRO/Sponsor approval 
as well as IRB or I EC approval. CRO/Sponsor may submit informed consent forms to a central 
IRB or IEC for review and approval or favorable opinion contingent upon prior Inve stigator 
permission and review. 
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective candidate will be given a full explanation of 
the study, allowed to read the approved informed consent form and be provided ample time and 
the opportunity to ask any questions that may arise. Once all questions have been answered and 
the Investigator is assured that the individual understands the implications of participating in the 
study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing the informed consent form. As part of the consent process, each patient must consent to direct access to hi s/her 
medical records for study-related monitoring, auditing, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection. The Investigator will provide a copy of the signed informed consent form to each patient. It should be clearly explained to each patient that participa tion in each and every clinical 
visit and assessment is expected. The patient may be discontinued from study drug, but that does not necessarily negate the expectation that the patient will continue to participate in the study through the final visit/assessment.  
If an amendment to the protocol changes the patient participation schedule in scope or activity, or increases the potential risk to the patient, the informed consent form must be revised, submitted to the IRB or IEC for review and approval or favorable opinion. The revised informed 
consent form must be used to obtain consent from a patient currently enrolled in the study if he 
or she is affected by the amendment. The revised informed consent form must be used to obtain consent from any new patients who are enrolled into the study after the date of the approval or 
favorable opinion of the amendment. 
16.4. Patient Privacy  
The Sponsor’s staff or any designees affirm and uphold the patient’s confidentiality. Throughout 
this study, all data forward to the Sponsor will be identified only by an identification number, date of birth, gender, and initials. The Investigator agrees that the Sponsor’s representatives, its 
designee, representatives of the relevant IRB/IEC or representatives of the regulatory authorities 
will be allowed to review that portion of the patient’s primary medical records that directly 
concerns this study (including, but not limited to, clinical laboratory test result reports, ECG 
reports, admission/discharge summaries for hospital admissions occ urring during a patient’s 
study participation and autopsy reports for deaths occurring during the study). 
For the studies conducted in the US, in accordance with the Healthcare Insurance, Portability, 
and Accountability Act of 1996, the Investigator will prepare a privacy authorization form and 
provide the form to CRO/Sponsor for approval prior to submission to the IRB/IEC or to a Privacy Board. CRO/Sponsor may provide a template privacy authorization form to be qualified 
by each research facility to confor m to local requirements. The content of the privacy 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 97 3 Dec 2014 authorization form must comply with the regulations governing the authorization. All 
prospective study candidates will be given full explanation of the privacy authorization form, 
allowed to read the appr oved form, and be provided the opportunity to ask any questions. Once 
all questions have been answered and the Investigator is assured that the individual understands 
the implications of the privacy authorization form, the patient will be asked to sign the  privacy 
authorization. The authorization remains in effect until revoked by the patient. The Investigator will provide a copy of the signed privacy authorization form to each patient. Patients who do not sign the privacy authorization form will not be per mitted to participate in the study.  
16.5. Protocol Amendments and Emergency Deviations 
Changes to the research covered by this protocol must be implemented by formal protocol amendment. Amendments to the protocol may be initiated by the Sponsor or at the request of the Investigator. In either case, a formal amendment cannot be initiated until the Sponsor has 
approved it, the Investigator has signed it off, and it has been reviewed and has received approval 
or favorable opinion by the IRB or IEC. 
Emergency deviati ons or modifications may be initiated without the Sponsor’s or IRB/IEC 
approval or favorable opinion, only in cases where the change is necessary to eliminate an 
immediate apparent hazard to patients. Emergency deviations or modifications must be reported to CRO/Sponsor and the IRB/IEC within five business days of the occurrence, or in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements. 
The study will not be un- blinded (where applicable) until all data have been reviewed, data entry 
has been completed, and the database is locked.  
16.6. Monitoring and Auditing of the Study  
A clinical monitor, whether an employee of the Sponsor or its designated representative, has the 
obligation to follow this study closely. In doing so, the monitor will visit the clinical study sites 
at periodic intervals, in addition to maintaining necessary telephone and letter contact. The monitor will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of 
study records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the 
Investigator and staff. Quality assurance auditors, whether an employee of the Sponsor or its designated representative, may evaluate the conduct of the study by the clinical study sites. 
These parties must have access to any and  all study-related documentation including source 
documentation, regardless of location and format. The Sponsor audit reports will be kept highly 
confidential. 
16.7. Study Documentation

contains medical information or test results that have been collected for or is in support of the protocol specifications, eg, clinical lab reports, clinic notes, drug disbursement log, patient sign 
in sheets, patient completed questionnaires, telephone logs, ECGs, etc. All draft, preliminary and 
pre-final iterations of a final report are also considered to be source documents, eg, faxed lab 
reports and hard copy lab reports, faxed initial results and hard copy, final report. 
CRO/Sponsor will supply CRFs. All requested information must be entered on the CRFs. Every 
effort should be made to complete all forms in their entirety. If an item is not available or is not applicable, this fact should be indicated; do not leave a space blank. Each set of completed CRFs 
must be reviewed, electronically signed  and dated by the Investigator. 
16.8. Laboratory Certification and Normal Values  
A local laboratory will be used for analysis for most of the clinical labs for this study. The site 
personnel will provide the CRO and Sponsor with laboratory certification(s), a dated copy of 
normal range values for the local laboratory clinical laboratory selected to analyze clinical 
specimens, and the l ab director’s CV.  
16.9. Drug Accountability 
The Investigator is responsible for storing the drug in a secure location and for maintaining adequate records of drug disposition that includes the dates, quantity, and use by patients. If the 
investigation is termina ted, discontinued, suspended, or completed, all unused supplies of drug 
will be returned to the Sponsor, unless other instructions are provided in writing by 
CRO/Sponsor. 
The drug will not be dispensed to any person who is not a study patient under this protocol. 
16.10. Records Retention  
The Investigator agrees to retain study records for the time periods stated below. The 
Investigator agrees to contact CRO/Sponsor before destroying any study documentation. Should 
the Investigator leave the site at which the study  was conducted, CRO/Sponsor will be contacted 
regarding the disposition of document storage. 
Records will be retained until at least 2  years after the last approval of a marketing application in 
an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH 
region or at least 2  years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development 
of the investigational product. 
Dates marking the beginning of the final record retention periods will be sent in writing from 
CRO/Sponsor. If an Investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation), the records will be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (ie, another Investigator). This transfer is subject 
to Sponsor approval and will be documented in writing and a copy sent to the Sponsor.

1. Requirements for Testing  
ECG equipment and supplies will be provided by ECG Vendor and should be used for all in-
clinic protocol ECG ass essments.  
• All 12-lead ECGs will be recorded in the same manner.  
• The site personnel must be adequately trained in performing ECGs on the specific ECG equipment used in this protocol that is provide d by the cardiac safety vendor.  
• To the extent possible, the same ECG machine and personnel should be used to acquire a patient’s ECGs throughout the period of their participation in the study.  
• Indelible ink will be used to mark the placement of the leads on the skin to ensure consistent placement throughout the study.  
• ECGs will be recorded with at least one 10 -second single-lead tracing recorded from 
Lead II. 
2. Patient Restrictions and Instructions  
• Prior to ECG acquisition, the patient will have rested 10 minutes in the supine position and will remain so until the ECG is obtained. 
3. Reporting  
• It is the responsibility of the Investigator to perform a safety review of the ECG data for changes from previous assessments and/or emergent cardiac dysfunction, and to 
determine patients’ eligibility or continuance in the study. 
• ECGs will be reviewed (signed and dated as necessary when an electronic system is 
not used) by an Investigator listed on the Form FDA 1572 (MD or DO) after each 
ECG collection. The same Investigator should review all ECG reports for a given patient whenever possible. 
• For all ECGs, a report will be provided by the cardiac safety vendor to the site for review and signature.  
• The ECG tracing will be kept with patient’s source documentation and / or CRF unless it is specified otherwise. The original ECG and the cardiologist’ s over-read 
will be retained at the site.  
4. Data Standardization 
ECG data will be transmitted to a centralized cardiac safety vendor and centrally over -read and 
interpreted using standardized procedures.

FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION 
 
Class Functional Capacity  
I Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitation of physical activity. 
Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or 
anginal pain. 
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, 
dyspnea, or anginal pain. 
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked li mitation of physical activity. They 
are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, 
dyspnea, or anginal pain. 
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be 
present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

Confidential and Proprietary 116 3 Dec 2014 25. APPENDIX VII.  DTH SKIN TEST PROCED URES 
DTH skin tests and evaluations will be performed  at the times indicated on the Schedules of 
Assessments ( Tables 3 - 6). At each time point indicated, both diluted WT2725 Injection for 
DTH skin test and the control will be administered and evaluated. 
 
Administration of diluted WT2725 Injection for DTH skin test : 
Use the diluted WT2725 Injection for DTH skin test (refer to Appendix VI  for preparation). 
Perform intradermal injection of 50  μL (10 μg) into the forearm.  
 
Administration of control for DTH skin test: 
Use the Diluting Solution for WT2725 Injection ( refer to Appendix VI  for preparation).  
Perform intradermal injection of 50  μL into the same forearm at a  site that is a distance of at least 
10 cm or more away from the dosing site of the diluted WT2725 Injection for DTH skin test. In the event of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, future dosing should be evaluated by the 
investigator and medical monito r. 
 
Approximately 48 hours (but no sooner than 24 hours) following the skin test injections, evaluate 
DTH reactions : 
For each site of the DTH skin test injection visually inspect the test site and palpate the area:  
• measure the area of erythema, if any, at the 2  injection sites, acro ss the long and short 
diameters  
• evaluate the quality of the reaction, such as redness, induration, ulceration, etc, if any, 
at the 2 injection sites  
 
If the DTH reactivity results in erythema with induration greater than 2  cm or leads to ulceration 
of the skin test site, further DTH testing should not be conducted for the patient.

Confidential and Proprietary 117 3 Dec 2014 26. APPENDIX VIII. DEFINITIONS FOR REPORTING  ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
The Investigator must assess the severity of the AE using the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.0 ( NCI 2009). 
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the AE to the study medication using the 
following: 
• Not related  – improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to other drugs or 
underlying disease. 
• Possible - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but could be 
related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease.  
• Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is unlikely to 
be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug.  
• Definite - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and cannot be 
explained by concurrent drugs or underlying disease. The adverse event should respond 
to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory before assigning a definite causality.  
The action taken regarding study drug will be defined as follows: 
• Dose Not Changed  – no change.  
• Dose Reduced.  
• Dose Increased.  
• Drug Interrupted  – study drug stopped temporarily. 
• Drug Withdrawn  – study drug stopped permanently. 
• Not Applicable.

Study Design:  This is a prospective, open -label, single -arm study  assessing the safety and clinical 
outcomes of StrataGraft skin tissue in the treatment of DPT thermal burn injuries  with intact dermal 
elements . Study e nrollment will be approximately 100 subjects but  will continue until StrataGraft 
becomes commercia lly available or until th  Sp nsor decides to close the study . Enrollment will 
include subjects with  a minimum of 3% and up to 50% TBSA of partial +/ - full thickness thermal 
burn. Treatment will include a single pplic tion of up to 1:1 meshed StrataGraft skin tissue on DPT  
wound (s) totaling  no more than approximately 2000 square centimeters in  area (no more than  3 study 
treatment  thermal burn areas and no more than  20 StrataGraft tissues  applied to the study treatment  
areas ). The wound bed  must be  cle n, excised and have bleeding controlled  prior to StrataGraft tissue 
application.  The tissues may be anchored with tissue adhesive, staples , or sutures , covered with a 
nonadherent, nonocclusive contact layer and additional secondary dressing s per institutional standard 
of care  (dressings should not contain silver).  Safety assessments will include monitoring of TEAEs, 
serious adverse events (SAEs) , wound infections,  and clinically significant vital signs, laboratory test 
results, and imm unological changes. Wound a ssessments will include measurement s for average 
depth, length , and width for calculations of area and percent epithelialization . Wound assessments 
will be facilitated by photographs taken by the subject and /or taken by the clinic al study site staff at 
study visits throughout the study. Scar evaluation using the POSAS will be conduct ed. Additionally, 
HCRU data will be collected. All subjects eligible to be consented throughout the duration of the 
study following application o f StrataGraft skin tissue to be part of a contact database and follow -up 
registry ; subjects will have the choice to decline with no impact to their participation in the study. In 
addition, a subset of 10 subjects (sourced from across all the sites) with closed wounds will be 
separately consented to have a punch biopsy (measuring  3 mm) taken from the center of the healed 
burn wound, and a nother punch biopsy measuring 3 mm taken from non -burned healthy skin. A 
histological evaluation of both samples will be  done to analyze and contrast the skin architecture in 
the healed burn wound with healthy skin. The biopsy will happen at the study visit Week 12 , 
regardless of when wound closure occur s. MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 17  4. INTRODUCTION  
Every year in the United States, approximately 45,000 patients experience burns that require 
them to be hospitalized, and of those individuals approximately 10 to 20% require surgical 
intervention such as autografti ng (American Burn, 2016 ). Depending upon the severity of the 
injury , hospitalization can often be protracted. Based on data in the 2017 National Burn 
Repos itory Annual Report, which includes data collected from 101 US burn centers in 37 states 
and the District of Columbia between 2008 and 2017, representing a cross -section of US 
hospitals , the average length of stay for survivors was slightly greater than 1 day per %TBSA 
burned (American Burn Association, 2017 ).  
After stabilization of the critical care issues in those who sustain a burn -injury, attention is 
directed toward burn wound management. The ultimate aim of burn w ound management is to 
prevent wound infection and facilitate closure of the wounds, either spontaneously or by 
autologous skin grafts. Key elements of burn wound management include cleansing, 
debridement and/or surgical excision,  and application topical an timicrobial agents  and dressings.  
Regardless of the age of the patient, evidence suggests that early excision of burn eschar is 
effective in decreasing morbidity, improving the mortality rate and reducing length of stay  
(Mull er, 1994 ; Herndon, 1989 ), as well as hospital costs  (Munster, 1994 ). Excised areas are 
usually closed with autograft, or if not available, allograft, xenograft or other skin substitute  is 
used until autograft is available or the wound spontan eously closes. Availability of autologous 
donor tissue , however, is limited by the extent of the burn injury, and in larger injuries, donor 
sites are often repeatedly harvested, increasing the likelihood of  chronic  scarring at those sites. 
As such, methods to reduce the amount of d nor tissue needed to achieve wound closure are 
always sought.  
4.1. Study Rationale  
StrataGraft skin tissue is an allogeneic tissue -engineered product . StrataGraft skin tissue is under 
development by Stratatech  Corpo tion , the Sponsor  Company, as an alternative to autografting 
in the closure  of thermal burns containing intact dermal elements.  
Clinical data from adults suggest  that treatment of DPT thermal burns with StrataGraft tissue c an 
result in wound closure while reducing or eliminating the need for autograft. Clinical data have 
also shown that this tissue construct does not transplant but  is replaced by the subject ’s cells as 
the wound heals  (Sponsor  unpublished data ). 
This study i s being conducted in order to provide continued access to StrataGraft skin tissue for 
clinical sites following the closure of enrollment to  the STRATA2016 study. This study will 
collect safety and clinical outcomes in a population of subjects with thermally  induced DPT  
burns that contain intact dermal elements.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with applicable regulation s and guidance related to 
GCP  and in compliance with this protocol.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 18  4.2. Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
Results to date indicate that StrataGraft skin tissue is well tolerated , and no acute clinical signs or 
symptoms of an allogeneic immune response have been reported. The most common noted 
adverse reaction associated with StrataGraft is pruritus .  
Subjects in this stu dy will undergo surgical excision of the burn area. The risks associated with 
the surgical procedure include pain and bleeding at the surgical site as well as potential 
complications of anesthesia, such as nausea/vomiting, chills, and sore throat. A subset  of 
10 subjects who achieve complete wound closure and have consent ed to study treatment will also 
undergo a biopsy of their healed StrataGraft -treated wound  sites at Week 12  to histologically 
assess tissue architecture and any other  histol ogical  tests as required . The risks associated with 
the procedure include those associated with application of a local anesthetic as well as pain or 
discomfort, bleeding, infection, and scarring at the biopsy site. All procedures and activities in 
this study, ot her than the actual application of StrataGraft tissue  and skin biopsy , are generally 
accepted as standard of care (SoC) for subject s with thermal burns and do not present any 
increased risk to the subjects.  
StrataGraft skin tissue is a viable, bilayer , allogeneic human skin substitute composed of a fully 
stratified epithelial layer comprised of NIKS  keratinocytes from a single human donor grown on 
a dermal equivalent comprised of purified Type I animal collagen containing normal human 
fibroblasts from a sec ond donor.  During development of the NIKS keratinocytes, these cells 
were previously exposed to murine feeder cells. These feeder cells were derived from a single 
source, thoroughly tested, and found to be free f detectable adventitious agents.  
 To comply 
with current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) xenotransplantation guidelines,  
 (FDA, 2016 ; 
Bloom, 2000 ) archival blood samples will be collected at baseline and retained in accordance 
with FDA guidelines.  
The benefit of treating burns wi h StrataGraft skin ti ssue is that the viable cells of StrataGraft 
tissue produce and secrete a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides that 
are collectively anticipated to facilitate wound repair and tissue regeneration.  
More detailed information about  the known and expected benefit s, risks, and reasonably 
expected adverse events (AE) can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.3. Summary of Relevant Clinical Studies  
Previous studies in adults with DPT  thermal burns have  demonstrated that StrataGraft skin  tissue 
is generally  safe with salutary clinical outcomes in regard to closure of DPT burns and 
elimination of autograft placement in the majority of subjects.  
The Phase 1b study , “Open -label, Controlled, Randomized, Multicenter, Dose Escalation Study 
Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of StrataGraft® Skin Tissue in Promoting the Healing of the 
Deep Partial -Thickness Component of Complex Skin Defects as an Alternative to Autografting,” 
(STRATA2011) was an open -label, dose -escalation, multicenter study eval uating the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of StrataGraft skin tissue in promoting the healing of complex skin 
defects containing intact dermal elements. In this study , StrataGraft skin tissue was applied once 
to DPT burns to assess autologous tissue re generation with reduction or elimination  of MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 19  autografts . This study included subjects with thermal burns of 3 to 49% TBSA . Each subject had 
2 comparable burn wound areas identified, excised to remove nonviable tissue, and randomized 
to receive StrataGraft s kin tissue or autograft. Thirty subjects were enrolled with 10 subjects in 
Cohort 1 receiving up to 220 cm2 of refrigerated StrataGraft skin tissue and 10 subjects in Cohort 
2 receiving up to 440 cm2 of refrigerated StrataGraft skin tissue. Ten s ubjects in  Cohort 3 
received up to 440 cm2 of thawed cryopreserved StrataGraft skin tissue . None  of the subjects 
treated with StrataGraft skin tissue exhibited any significant safety concerns and none underwent 
autografting prior to Day 28. Additionally, 27 of the 2 8 per -protocol subjects  (96%)  exhibited 
complete wound closure of StrataGraft treatment sites at Month 3 . Molecular analysis of  biopsies 
taken from treated wound sites at Month 3  demonstrated  no evidence of StrataGraft skin tissue  
DNA , indicating that the cellular components of StrataGraft skin tissue were no longer present . 
The Phase  3 study “A Multicenter, Open -Label, Randomized Comparison of the Efficacy and 
Safety of StrataGraft Skin Tissue vs Autograft in Adult Subjects with Thermal Burns” 
(STRATA2016)  is an open -label, controlled, randomized, multicenter study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of StrataGraft skin tissue in the treatment of complex skin defects due to 
thermal burns that contain intact dermal elements and for which surgical excision and  
autografting are clinically indicated. The number of enrolled subjects was 71 and the last subject  
completed all study procedures in March 2020 . No Stra aGraft -related SAE s were  reported.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a P hase 3b, open -label, multicenter study of adults evaluating the safety and clinical 
outcomes of Strata Graft® skin tissue in the treatment of thermally induced DPT  burns that 
contain intact dermal elem ents. 
No randomization will be conducted for the study, as this study is designed to be a single arm 
study.  
Subjects may be assessed to have no more than 3 noncontiguous burn areas treated and receive 
no more than 20 tissues of StrataGraft skin tissue  (for a total StrataGraft skin tissue treated area 
of no more than approximately 2000 cm2).  
The primary endpoint  is count and percent  of subjects with TEAEs . 
Other endpoints include :  
• The propor tion of StrataGraft skin tissue -treated wound area with confi rmed  wound 
closure without autograft placement (ie, complete re -epithelialization without 
drainage and subsequently verified by confirmation assessment ) on or before 
Week  12 and supported by photo -documentation . 
• The p roportion of subjects with confirmed  wound closure without autograft 
placement (verified with confirmation assessment) at each visit  and supported by photo -
documentation . 
• The proportion of subjects without autografting achieving and maintaining durable 
wound closure by Week  24. Durable wound  closure is achieved when a wound is 
observed as remaining closed at l ast 3 months after complete wound closure.  
• The time to confirmed  wound closure without autograft placement (verified with 
confirmation assessment). For in -person visits, the investigat or will assess the wound 
in person or alternatively assess a photo provided by the subject if the subject misses 
a visit. For the weeks in -between onsite visits, the subject will have a photo taken and 
send them to a photo repository beginning at discharge  then weekly until Week 12 
and then every other week  until Week 24. These photos will also be assessed by the 
princip al investigator.  
• Skin quality and cosmesis  assessments at Week 12 and Week 24 by the subjec t and 
observer using POSAS  scores ; these assessments will be  supported both by 
photo -documentation  and POSAS  scores . 
• Number (%) of subjects with wound -infection related events .

 26  6.1.2.  Study Design Rationale  
This Phase 3b, open -label study provides the opportunity of continuing access of StrataGraft skin 
tissue at clinical study  sites that participated in the prior Phase 3 study. Safety assessments and 
clinical outcomes will be collected and analyzed to supplement the safety info rmation regarding 
this product , allow for collection of health economic data, and provide additional efficacy 
outcomes data. 
6.1.3.  Treatment Rationale  
Observ ation s in prior clinical studies suggest  that StrataGraft skin tissue may promote healing  of 
DPT burns wi th intact dermal elements . In prior studies with Strata Graft skin tissue in this 
population, n o clinical ly important untoward effects have been a ssociated solely with treatment 
with StrataGraft skin tissue.  
6.1.4.  End of Study Definition  
Study end for a given sub ject will be marked following the r trieval of all Week 24 treatment 
assessments collected for the subject in the study and resolution of any complications from 
serious TEAEs.  The study enrollment will not end until either the time that StrataGraft  skin 
tissue is commercially available or the time that the Sponsor terminates the study , whichever 
occurs first . All subjects will be followed until th y complete their participation as described by 
this protocol.  
6.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 100 s ubjects will be scr en ed and treated with StrataGraft skin tissue (enrolled 
into the study) until StrataGraft  skin tissue  is commercially available or until the Sponsor closes 
the study.  
6.3. Treatment Assignment  
Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria will re ceive StrataGraft skin tissue treatment. Subjects 
are considered enrolled into the study once they have StrataGraft skin tissue  treatment applied to 
a burn site.  Subjects will receive 1 application of Strata Graft skin tissue (s) to no more than 3 
burn sites  with no more than 20 StrataGraft skin tissues applied to the burn sites  and a total study 
treatment area of no more than approximately 2000 cm2. 
6.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
No dose adjustment will be made during this study.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 27  6.5. Provision s for Remote Assessment Methods  
For publicly  stated emergency situations where there are extenuating circumstance s that prohibit 
physical visits to the clinical site or when the safety of subjects may be compromised by physical 
visits to the site , provisions for remote assessment s have been addressed.  
For publicly  stated emergency situations, the v isit windows can be expanded as follows . 
Weeks 1 and 2  ± 5 days  
Week 4  ± 12 days  
Weeks 8, 12, 24  ± 14 days  
 
Refer to the Manual of Procedures  for a list of those assessments ; remote collection of certain 
clinical assessments may be allowed . 
6.6. Criteria for Study Stopping  
Subject enrollment will be stopped if any of the following SAEs occur:  
• Necrotizing soft tissue infection of th  study wound attributed to StrataGraft  skin 
tissue  
• Severe acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to StrataGraft skin tissue  
• Death attributed to StrataGraft skin tissue  
In the event that one of the listed SAE s occurs, the FDA  and the  local institutional review board 
(IRB) will be notified according to the  decision tree for reporting SAE s as presented in the 
Manual of Procedures . The Medical Monitor will review the safety data associated with the 
adverse reaction with the clinical investigator and generate a summary narrative. The Medical 
Monitor, the Global Saf ety Lead , and the Clinical Trial Lead will conduct a comprehensive 
review of the safety data that will be submitted to the FDA prior to resumption of subject 
enrollment.  
An independent adhoc  Safety Committee  made up of DSMB members familiar with  other 
StrataGraft studies will be on stand -by to serve as  external adjudicators in the event that any of 
the prior listed SAEs occurs and study enrollment is halted. The Safety Committee  working with 
the Medical Monitor, the Global Safety Lead and the Clinical Trial  Lead  will determine if and 
when the study may be restarted.

8.1. Description of Study Treatment  
The study t reatment is described in Table 3.  
Table 3: Investigational Produc t 
Product Name:  StrataGraft skin tissue  
Dosage Form /Physical Description : StrataGraft skin tissue is an off -white rectangular 
sheet of approximately 100 cm2 (approximately 
8 cm by 12.5 cm), consisting of a viable, 
bioengineered, regenerative skin construct 
derived from human keratinocytes grown on 
gelled collagen co ntaining human dermal 
fibroblas s. StrataGraft skin tissue is stored at  
-70°C to -90°C until thawed for use. The hold 
solution that must be used with the StrataGraft 
skin tissue must be stored at 2° to 8°C until 
required for  surgery.  
Dosage  One application of sheets of no more than 20 
StrataGraft skin tissues and applied to no more 
than 3 noncontiguous burn sites and applied to no 
more than approximately 2000 cm2 total burn area 
to wounds with intact dermal elements  
Route of Administration  StrataGraft skin tissue is applied topically to 
thermal burns that have been surgically excised to 
remove nonviable tissue. It is meshed up to 1:1, 
placed onto the wound bed, trimmed to fit the 
wound as necessary, and secured in place.  
Manufacturer  Stratat ech, a Mallinckrodt Company  
 
8.2. Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications, including the use of antibiotics, must be recorded in the eCRF after 
the consent form is signed and throughout the study period. Systemic and topical 
antibiotics/antimicrobials may be used at the discretion of the clinical investigator with the 
exception of sulfa mylon  and silver -containing antimicrobials and silver -containing dressings. 
The use of sulfa mylon  and silver containing/releasing antimicrobial s and dressings is not 
recommend ed as they are thought to interfere with the viability of the living cells in StrataGraft 
skin tissue. Prior to StrataGraft skin tissue placement, chlorhexidine can be applied to burn sites 
for wound preparation but must be thoroughly rinsed off prior to StrataGraft placement. After MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

also not recommend ed. Use of any of the aforementioned antiseptic s at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator, after StrataGraf t skin tissue placement,  would not be considered a 
protocol deviation.  Additionally, investigational agents may not be used for the duration of study 
period. All other concomitant medications are un restrict ed. Intrave nous fluids generally used to 
maintain hydration and general anesthetic given during surgery need not be captured as 
concomitant medication s.  
8.3. Concomitant Procedures  
Any concomitant procedure (including transfusions, use of xenogenic or allogen eic products , 
negative pressure wound therapy, etc.) must be recorded in the eCRF after the consent form is 
signed and throughout the duration of the study.

9.1. Study Treatment  
StrataGraft® skin tissue  
9.2. Study Treatment  Packaging and Labeling  
See Investigator’s Brochure  
9.3. Study Treatment  Storage  
StrataGraft skin tissue is stored in a freezer at -70°C to -90°C. 
9.4. Study Treatment  Preparation  
See Manual of Procedures: Patient Kit Receipt and StrataGraft Skin Tissue Thaw Instructions  
9.5. Study Administration  
Once the designated study site(s) have been excised and the subject is determined to meet all 
eligibility criteria, StrataGraft skin tissue will be meshed up to 1:1  and secured to the wound with 
sutures, staples, or t issue adhesives and then dressed with a non -adherent, porous dressing.  
Secondary dressings  will be applied that are designed to maintain a moist wound environment 
and protect tissue from maceration and external contamination.   
Silver -containing dressings a re not recommended for use in this study. No adhesive dressing, 
tape, or adhesive strips, may be applied directly on the StrataGraft skin tissue -covered site or its 
periphery during the study period. Prior to StrataGraft skin tissue placement, chlorhexidin e can 
be applied to burn sites for wound preparation but must be thoroughly rinsed off before 
StrataGraft placement. After StrataGraft skin tissue placement, further use of this antiseptic is 
not recommended.  
It is not expect ed that StrataGraft skin tissue  will incorporate in to the wound bed due to vascular 
ingrowth as is seen with autologous skin grafts. It is anticipated that maximal benefit from 
treatment with StrataGraft  skin tissue would come after maintenance of  contact with the clean 
wound bed for as long as possible. Therefore, it is important to be careful during dressing 
changes during the first few weeks following placement.  
Week 1: The non -adherent porous contact layer dressing should remain anchored in pla ce for at 
least 3 days in order to prevent dislodging of the StrataGraft skin tissue. This non -adherent  layer 
may or may not be replaced at the discretion of the Investigator. The frequency of changes of the 
secondary dressings is at the discretion of the Investigator paying attention to the precautions 
listed below . 
Weeks 2 to 3: The contact layer dressing may be removed with care not to dislodge any 
remaining adherent StrataGraft skin tissue. Replacement of a nonadherent contact layer is 
recommended. All secondary dressings and frequency of changes are at the discretion of the 
Investigator paying attention to the  precautions listed below . The healing epidermis beneath 
StrataGraft skin tissue may result in small areas of drying and lifting of StrataGraft ch anging the 
appearance to one that may be  described as shabby or flaky. Over time, the dried StrataGraft skin MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

new, healthy epidermis expands beneath it. The healing wound still requires protection from 
shear forces as the new skin matures.  
Week 4 through remainder of study: All dressings will be changed per institutional SoC  until 
healing, or as long as deemed clinically necessary by the Investigator.

 34  10. ASSESSMENT OF OTHER PRE -SPECIFIED ENDPOINTS  
Wound closure  
Complete wound closure is defined as 100% skin re -epithelialization in the absence of drainage . 
Successful wound closure in this study requires that complete wound closure is achieved without 
autograft  placement  and is confirmed at least 2 weeks following the initial obs ervation of 
complete closure.  The clinical investigator will evaluate treatment site (s), assess the proportion  
of the treated wound closed , complete wound closure , and confirmation of complete wound 
closure either by direct clinician observation or by subject-provided photo -documentation  per 
Schedule of Assessment s (Section  6.1.1 ).  
Photo -documentation  
Photographs will be taken by the clinician to supplement clinical assessment of percentage 
epithelialization,  complete wound closure, confirmed wound closure, durable wound closure and 
the POSAS assessments ( eg, appearance and cosmesis) of the treatment sites. Photographs taken 
and submitted by the  subject (or other person designated by the subject)  may be used for 
evidence of wound characteristics if a visit is missed or for a  unscheduled  visit. 
Photo-documentation is submitted by the subject beginning at discharge then weekly until Week 
12 and th en every other week until Week 2 4. These subjec t-submitted photos are only possible if 
the P rincip al Investigator  gives approv al for  the subject to take off their dressings at home. In the 
event the dressings are not allowed to be changed at home, no subje ct photos will be expected or 
required. Photos submitted during weeks when there are no in-person  visits would serve as an 
allowable proxy for observing wound characteristics. If a subject’s wound is noted to be closed 
for the first time via a submitted ph oto, that photo should trigger the scheduling of a visit 2 
weeks later for confirmation of wound healing . See Manual of Procedures for specific 
instructions regarding the methodology for obtaining photographs.  
10.1. Other Endpoint s 
Assessments will be documented to determine other endpoints:  
• Proportion of subjects with confirmed wound closure without autograft placement (ie, 
complete re -epithelialization without drainage and subsequently verified with 
confirmation assessment) on  or before Week  12 and supported by 
photo -documentation  
• Proportion of subjects with confirmed wound closure without autograft (verified with 
confirmation assessment) at each visit and supported by photo -documentation  
• Proportion of subjects without autografting who maintain durable wound closure by 
Week  24 
• Time to confirmed wound closure without autografting (verified with confirmation 
assessment)  
• Treatment site skin quality data: The total observed POSAS by clinician and by 
subject. Per site descriptive statisti cs will be presented separately for clinician and 
subject values for each of the individual POSAS items and the total POSAS score, MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 36  11. OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
A subset of 10 subjects with closed wounds ( from subjects who have  achieved  wound closure, 
across all the  clinical sites) will be separately consented to have a punch biopsy (measuring 3 
mm) taken from the center of the healed burn wound, and another punch biopsy measuring 3 mm 
taken from non -burned healthy skin. A histological evaluation of both samples will be done to 
analyze and contrast the skin architecture in the healed burn wound with healthy skin. The 
biopsy will occur at the study visit Week 12, reg ardless of when wound closure occurs . 
Wound assessments will include measurements for average depth, length, and width for 
calculations of area and percent epithelialization. Wound assessments will be facilitated by 
photographs taken by the subject and/or taken by the clinical study site staff at study visits 
throughout the study.   MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 37  12. SAFETY ASSESSMENT   
Safety will be monitored from the time of subject signing consent to participate in the study and 
include s: TEAE s, treatment -emergent SAE s, local wound infection s, systemic infections, vital 
signs , and deaths  throughout the study duration.  In addition to the collection of common clinical 
study safety data, blood samples (blood plasma and leucocytes) will be collected to comply with 
the archival xenotransp lantation FDA requirements.  
12.1. Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary objective of this study is to d emonstrate the safety of a single application of 
StrataGraft skin tissue in the post excision treatment of thermally induced DPT  burns that 
contain intact dermal  elements. The primary safety endpoint is the count and percentage of 
subjects with TEAEs.  
 
Primary Outcome Measure : 
Title:  
Number of subjects with TEAEs  
 
Description:  
Total count of participants observed with TEAEs during the study  
 
Timeframe:  
Approximately 24 weeks  
 
12.2. Safety Parameters Specific to Therapeutic Category  
12.2.1.  Incidence of infection  
Local wound infection will be determined by the clinical investigator and may include 
confirmatory microbiological assessment. S imilarly, s ystemic infection will be determined by the 
clinical investigator and may include documentation of such signs as positive blood cultures , 
fever (defined as >38.5oC) and/or elevated white blood cell count.  
Study treatment  sites will be examined by the investigator for signs  and symptoms of infection at 
every study visit. Cultures of the treatment sites may be obtained for microbiological evaluation 
at the discretion of the clinical investigator or per institutional S oC at any time during treatment. 
The clinical investigator will evaluate the wound culture results for clinical significance. 
Infections and their treatment must be documented in the eCRF  with notation of 
StrataGraft -treated site or “ Other” ( ie, SoC treatment) . MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 38  12.2.2.  Archival plasma and leukocyte samples  
In accordance w ith current xenotransplantation  FDA Guidance , an archival blood sample will be 
collected at Day 1 (Baseline ) prior to StrataGraft skin tissue placement and retained.  For further 
detail, see Manual of Procedures , Subject Plasma and Leukocyte Archival . 
12.2.3.  Immunology  
Blood collection for PRA testing (HLA I and II) will be conducted at Day 1 (Baseline), Week 4, 
and Week 12.  
12.2.4.  Regrafting and Delayed Wound Healing  
In the event that a StrataGraft -treated area needs to be regrafted with either an autograft or a 
xenograft after prior treatment with StrataGraft skin tissue, the event would not be marked as an 
AE, but rather as a failure  to close . In the event that there is an accompanying wound 
degradation event occurring simultaneously such as infectio  that results in delayed wound 
healing, the delayed wound healing secondary to the ongoing inf ction can be listed as an AE or 
SAE as applicable. If that infective process eventually w rrants regrafting, the regrafting should 
still be marked as a failure to close and no t an AE.  
12.3. Standard Safety Parameters  
12.3.1.  Demographic/ Social/ Medical History  
Past medical history , social,  and acute medical history will be collected at Screening.  Medical 
history will be reviewed for eligibility for enrollment into the study as described in th e inclusion 
criteria.  
12.3.2.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, p lse  rate, temperature) will be measur ed at each scheduled study 
time point.  The change from baseline will be calculated for each study time  point  for clinical 
safety analyses . 
12.3.3.  Weight and Height  
Weight and height will be measured at Screening .  
12.3.4.  Physical Examination  
The limited Physical Examination will be conducted at Screening to include evaluation of lungs, 
heart, abdomen, and extremities. The findings of the physical examination will be recorded on 
the eCRF.  
12.3.5.  Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory safety parameters will be evaluated for clinically significant changes within this 
subjec t population at Baseline , defined study intervals , and as deemed appropriate by the 
clinician according to the institutional S oC in the evaluation of  study subjects .  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

Hematology evaluation s will include hemoglobin, platelets, red blood cell count and white blood 
cell count  with differential.  
12.3.5.2.  Blood Chemistry  
Blood chemistry assessment s will include alanin e transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and 
bilirubin, glucose, electrolytes, and creatinine.  
12.3.5.3.  Immunology  Assessments  
Immunological evaluations will include PRA with HLA class I and II screening and testing  for 
allelic reactivity . 
12.3.5.4.  Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test for women of child -bearing potential will be performed  at Screening  
using the local laboratory . Should a pregnancy be confirmed after placement of StrataGraft, the 
pregnanc y will be reported as a special event (ie, not an AE) . Since StrataGr aft skin tissue is a 
single application, the subject will continue with all scheduled study evaluations. Pregnant 
subjects will be followed until post-partum  and the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported . 
12.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Defin ition of Adverse Events  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a 
pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered casually related to the produc t. In clinical studies, an AE can include 
an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including Baseline or washout periods, 
even if no study treatment has been administered.  
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the consent form  and the AEs occurring during 
treatment  must be recorded on forms provided by  the Sponsor , whether or not they are related to 
the study.  
Definition of SAE  
An SAE  is an AE occurring during any part of the study period  (ie, Baseline, treatment, washout, 
or follow -up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfil ls 
one or more of the following:  
• Results in death ; all AEs with an outcome of death must be reported as SAEs. The 
Investigator should make every effort to obtain and send death certificates and 
autopsy reports to the Sponsor or designee, or state “not available.”  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• It results in persistent or significant d isability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

Protocol MNK01053115  StrataGraft  
Amendment 1  
Confidential and Proprietary  
 40  • It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
12.5. Intensity of Adverse Event  
Intens ity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activiti es) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
of an AE, whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.4. An AE of severe 
intensity may not always be considered an SAE . 
12.6. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is licensed to practice medicine must make the determination of relationship 
to the investigational product for each AE ( unrelated, possibly related or probably related ). The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product.  If no valid reason 
exists fo r suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then  the AE should be 
considered “related.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” , the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product 
for the purposes of exped ited regulatory reporting.  
12.7. Other Adverse Event  
The Drug Safety Physician and  if applicable, the Clinical Study Team Physician will identify 
other adverse event(s) during the evaluation of safety data for the Clinical Study Report.  
Significant adverse eve nts of particular clinical importance  will be collected as adverse events of 
special interest , ie, events other than SAEs and those AEs leading to discontinuation of the 
subject from the study ). For each adverse event of special interest , a narrative may b e written and 
included in the clinical study report.  
12.8. Pregnancy Events  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the Sponsor ’s pregnancy form.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational 
product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , or 
congenital abnormality /birth defects ) must be recorded on the eCRF , even if the subject  is 
discontinued from the study.  Elective abortions without complications are not considered  an AE  
and are not reported as an AE.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 41  All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects , spontaneous miscarriages , and serious 
complica tions due to pregnancy  should be reported  as SAEs .  
In this study, subjects will not be discontinued from the study unless the subject elects to 
withdraw consent.  
12.9. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the  subject and/or in respo nse to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site.  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse 
rate need not be reported as AEs.  Howe ver, abnormal values that constitute an SAE , are 
associated with an SAE,  or lead to discontinuation of administration of study treatment  must be 
reported and recorded as an AE.  Information about AEs will be collected from the signing of 
consent form until the end of the study.  All SAE information will be collected from the signing 
of consent form  and throughout the study follow -up period . The AE term s should be reported in 
standard medical terminology when possible.  For each AE  the i vestigator will evalua te and 
report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, 
serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study . 
12.10.  Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unre lated) will be recorded from the signing of consent form until 
following the end of treatment exposure.  All SAEs must be reported to Sponsor  within 1 
business day of the first awareness of the ev nt.  The Investigator must complete, sign and date 
the SAE pa ges, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the 
corresponding source documents, and s nd a copy by fax to  the Sponsor .  
Additional follow -up information  if required or available, should all be faxed to the Sponsor 
within 1 business day of receipt and this should be completed on a follow -up SAE form and 
placed with the original SAE inf rmation and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF  
and/or study file.  
The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events.  It is 
the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB or Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) of all SAEs that occur at his or her site.  Investigators will also be notified of all 
unexpected, serious, treatment -related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the 
clinical study . Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC of all SAEs.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

13.1. Sample Size Determinations  
No sample size determination was made for this study, as this is  1 treatment group , non -
randomized study  designed to accumulate supplemental safety and efficacy data for the use of 
StrataGraft for the treatment of DPT wounds with intact dermal elements.  This study will enroll 
approximately 100 subjects from up to 18 clini cal study centers  that previously participated in  
the prior Phase  3 study . 
13.2. Analysis Populations  
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study but were 
not subsequently treated with StrataGraft skin tissue.  
The modified intention -to-treat (mITT) population  will include all subjects who enrolled and 
received StrataGraft skin tissue.  The safety and efficacy analyse s will be based on the mITT 
population.  
13.3. Statistical Analysis  
This section provides a general summary of t he statistical methods to be used in analyzing study 
data. A more detailed statistical analysis plan will be provided in a separate document that will 
be finalized prior to database lock.  
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include the mea n, median, standard deviation, 
minimum value, and maximum value. Categorical data will be summarized by counts  and 
percentages.  
Assessments of photographs of burn sites will be used as confirmatory evidence of durable 
closure in cases of absence of an in-person visit and for weeks where an in -person visit is not 
scheduled.  
All data documented in the eCRFs and lab oratory test result s, including repeated and 
unscheduled assessments, will be presented in data listings.  
13.3.1.  Primary Safety Endpoint Analysis  
The primary endpoint analysis will be count and percent of subjects with TEAE s. This endpoint 
will be analyzed based on the mITT population.  
13.3.2.  Other Pre-specified Endpoint  Analyses  
For this study, confirmed wound closure is defined as  meeting wound determinatio ns at 2 visits :  
1. First, a visit at which the clinician determined complete  (100%)  re-epithelialization 
without drainage  
2. Second, an assessment at a subsequent visit that is at least 2 weeks later than the first visit 
and wound closure was confirmed (ie, determined again) to be completely closed  
Durable wound closure is achieved when a wound is observed as remaining closed at least 
3 months after complete wound closure .  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 43  The clinician may determine confirmed wound closure and durable closure either by directly 
observing the wound or by assessing appropriate photo -documentation  that will be provided 
electronically by the subject weekly for the first 12 weeks and then provided every other week  
through to Week 24 . The following endpoint s will be analyzed with descriptive statistics  with 
95% confidence intervals : 
• Proportion of subjects with confirmed wound closure without autograft placement ( ie, 
complete re -epithelialization without drainage and subsequently verified with 
confirmation assessment) on or before Week  12 and supported by photo -
documentation  
• Proportion of subjects with confirmed wound closure without autograft (verified with 
confirmation assessment) at each visit and supported by photo -documentation  
• Proportion of subjects without autogr afting who maintain durable wound closure by 
Week  24 
• Time to confirmed wound closure without autografting (verified with confirmation 
assessment ) 
• Treatment site skin quality data: The total observed POSAS by clinician and by 
subject. Per site descriptive s tatistics will be presented separately  for clinician  and 
subject values for each of the individual  POSAS items and the total POSAS score , 
represented as the mean score across all treatment sites  and supported by 
photo -documentation  
• Number  (%) of subjects w ith wound  infection -related events  
The time to first confirmed  wound closure (verified with confirmation assessment) will be 
analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier estimation method. The period for this analysis is calculated as 
(the date of having the first event  the date of Day 1 + 1). Subjects not having any event during 
the study will have their time censored at the last available date in the study. Kaplan -Meier 
estimates by StrataGraft treatment area with confirmed wound closure will be presented for the 
follo wing categories: ≤ 500 cm2, > 500 cm2. 
13.3.3.  Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
Results from all HCRU parameters as exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics by  visit:  
• Location of care for StrataGraft application  (eg, inpatient h ospital, 
outpatient/ambulatory hospital, clinic, etc.)  
• Treatments used for all other burn areas following excision and %TBSA treated with 
each (other than StrataGraft treatment sites)  
• Number of OR procedures required for burn treatment: excisions, applicat ion of 
StrataGraft tissue and all other grafting procedures, including autografts , allografts , 
and xenografts

The primary safety endpoint analysis will be count and percent of subjects with TEAE s and will 
be based on mITT population . 
No formal hypothesis testing will be performed for any safety variables.  All s afety variables will 
be summarized with descriptive statisti cs. 
Adverse Events  
The TEAE is defined as those adverse events with onset date and time after the first placement of 
study product or those events in which the onset date and time are before the f irst placement of 
study product but worsened after the first placement of study product. Coding of adverse events 
will be performed using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  classification system . 
The number  (%) of TEAE of subjects who experie nced at least 1 TEAE will be summarized by 
system organ class and by preferred term. The TEAE s will also be summarized by maximum 
severity and by strongest relationship to StrataGraft skin tissue. The TEAE s on study treatment 
sites ( StrataGraft  skin tissue -treated  sites) and other nonstudy  treatment ( SoC-treated sites) will 
be summarized by system organ class and by preferred term ; SAE will be tabulated and listed in 
a manner similar to TEAE.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 45  Infection  
The incidence of infection of the study treatment sites  will be present ed.  
Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse  rate, temperature) will be calculated and presented at each 
scheduled time point , as will the change from Baseline . 
Safety Laboratory Parameters  
Safety laboratory tests ( including creatinine  and complete blood count  with differential) will be 
calculated  and presented at each scheduled time point , as will  the change from Baseline.  
Safety laboratory test results will be c ategoriz ed and presented as “Low,” “Normal” and “High” , 
as defin ed by the sites’ laboratory normal range. Additionally, s hift tables will be presented 
summarizing changes from normal to out -of-normal range.  
13.3.8.  Handling of Missing Data  
No imputation for missing values will be conducted.  All obs rved values (ie, excluding m issing 
value s for visit) will be used  for the analyses .  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 46  14. DIRECT A CCESS TO SOURCE D ATA /DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study, a representative of the Sponsor 
will visit the investigational study site to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives.  This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor and the 
investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or representative will have regular contacts with 
the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the  eCRFs , and that investigational product accountability checks 
are being performed  
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRF s 
with the subject ’s medical records t the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to 
the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject  (eg, 
medical records ). 
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forward d to the Sponsor and those SAEs  that met criteria for reporting 
have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor , a regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the 
site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of a  
Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related 
activities and documents to d etermine whether these activities were conducted, and data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the  
International Council for Harmoni sation, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigat or should contact the Sponsor immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about 
an inspection.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-02 Oct 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

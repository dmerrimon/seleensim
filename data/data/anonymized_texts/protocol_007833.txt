1 1 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. Primary Objective :  To characterize  the effect on pharmacokinetic parameters of  
capecitabine , when dosed using actual versus ideal body weight in obese patients 
with adva nced solid tumors.  
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives :  
  1.2.1  To characterize  the response rate and progression free survival with  
capecitabine therapy in obese subjects with advanced solid tumors  
   
  1.2.2 To determine capecitabine pharmacokinetics in obese p atients compared with 
normal weight historical controls.  
  
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease  
 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States.1  The prognosis associated 
with distant metastases from adult solid tumors is poor for most malignanc ies.  The goal of 
treatment with systemic therapies is primarily palliative for these patients.  Determining the 
optimal dosing of systemic therapies would improve anti -tumor efficacy and limit drug –
related toxicities.   
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
In 2012, the Amer ican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published clinical practice 
guidelines regarding appropriate chemotherapy dosing for obese adult patients with cancer.1  
Although these guidelines recomme nded that full weight -based chemotherapy doses be used 
to treat obese patients, the authors highlighted the limited data for these recommendations 
and emphasized that further research into the role of pharmacokinetics to guide 
appropriate dosing of chemoth erapy in obese patients is critically needed .  This issue is 
particularly relevant given the increasing obesity epidemic in the United States and 
worldwide.  Obesity is defined as a body mass index of 30kg/m2 or greater.  Currently, more 
than 1/3 (35.7%) o f U.S. Adults are obese, which has doubled since 1980.2  This is also 
pertinent for the U niversity of Wisconsin  patient population.  In 2010, the Center for Disease 
Control estimat ed that 26.3% of Wisconsin adults were obese.2  
 
Optimal doses of oncology treatments are established through clinical trials.  However, the 
majority of chemotherapy agents and man y targeted anti -cancer agents are dosed based on 
weight, with chemotherapy most often dosed based on estimated body surface area (BSA).  
The estimated BSA is calculated using standardized formulas.3   BSA was initially used for 
chemotherapy dosing because of its ability to correlate with many of the physiologic 
parameters which impact drug pharmacokinetics, such as bl ood volume and renal clearance. 4 
 Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as AUC and Cmax, have been associated with clinical 
efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy agents.5  However, inter -individual pharmacokinetic 
variation remains a challenge, as this can impact drug efficacy and adverse events.  Obesity 
may account for some of this pharmacokinetic variatio n.  Based on concerns about increased 
   
 2 
 toxicity with higher doses of chemotherapy in obese patients, many oncologists elect to either 
cap chemotherapy dosing or use an adjusted BSA formula for obese patients.6,7   However, 
empirically lowering the dose of chemotherapy may lead to compromised anti -tumor 
efficacy, as several studies have indicated that dose -intensity of chemotherapy correlates 
with outcomes.8,9  Obesity has been associated with poorer cancer outcomes.10  Although this 
correlation is likely multi -factorial, in part this may reflect sub -optimal chemotherapy dosing.  
 
To date, there have been no prospective, randomized stu dies comparing cancer outcomes 
using a full  weight based approach to a  limited-weight dosing approach of chemotherapy in 
obese cancer patients.1  The ASCO guidelines for dosing of chemotherapy in  obese patients 
based their recommendations on several retrospective and observational studies which 
suggested that there is no increased toxicity in obese patients administered full  weight based 
doses.11,12   In order to better understand the impact of full  weight based chemotherapy 
dosing, we propose a pilot study evaluating intra -patient changes in pharmac okinetic 
parameters using two dosing approaches of the commonly used chemotherapy agents, 
capecitabine.   
 
2.3  Study Drug:  Capecitabine    
 
Capecitabine is an oral anti -metabolite chemotherapy.  It is a prodrug of 5 -FU13 and is FDA 
approved and commonly used in the treatment of gast rointestinal and breast cancers.  }  It has 
a short half -life and is typically dosed twice daily for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 1 
week break.14 Capecitabine is converted by three enzymes in the liver and tumors to 5 -FU. 
The final step in this being conversion of 5’deoxy -5-fluorouridine to 5FU by thymidine 
phosphorylase. 5FU inhibits thymidilate synthase  causing inhibition of DNA synthesis.13 
 
Clinical Experience  with Capecitabine :  
  
Colon and rectal cancers  rank as the third most common ca ncer in the United S tates and 
CRC the second le ading cause of U.S. c ancer deaths.15  Obesity has been linked with an 
increased risk for development of colorectal cancers.16,17  Although survival rates for limite d-
stage disease remain high, m etastatic disease has a five -year survival of less than 10%, 
although median survival now approaches two years with co mbination therapy.18,19 
   
As a single agent in metastat ic colorectal cancer, capecitabine  has response rate s ranging 
from 18.9 -25.8% with equal efficacy compared to 5 -FU/leucovorin but significantly fewer 
toxicities.20,21 It also has been demonstrated to have activity in 3rd line metastatic colorectal 
cancer. 22 Capecitabine has also been studied i n conjunction with oxali platin in advanced 
colorectal cancer with response rates of 35 -55%.23,24   Capectabine has become a standard 
chemotherapy agent used to treat  metastatic colorectal cancers.   Interesting, there is an 
emerging body of literature suggesting that pharmacokinetically - guided fluorouracil (5 -FU) 
dose adjustment versus standard body-surface-area (BSA) dosing in metasta tic colorectal 
cancer may be more effective. 25,26  This suggests that understanding the pharmacokinetic 
impact of a limited -weight based dosing approach would be important with this drug, with 
the evidence suggesting that lower steady state concentrations may negatively impact clinical 
outcomes.   
   
 3 
  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the seco nd leading cause of cancer 
death in wo men. Despite the availability of many targeted, endocrine and chemotherapy 
agents, over 40,000 women die each year from metastatic breast cancer.19Interestingly, 
obesity and weight gain have been demonstrated to increase a woman’s risk of developing 
breast cancer, in particular, post -menopausal breast cancer.27,28 
 
Capecitabine has been extensively studied in metastatic breast cancer.  Single agent therapy 
yields response rates of 15 -29% in patients pre -treated with anthracyclines an d taxanes,  29-31 
As a component of combination therapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel or ixabepilone, 
capecitabine improves response rates and progress ion-free survival , although the impact of 
doublet therapy  on overall survival  is less clear .32-34  Capecitabine has also been studied and 
approve in combination with lapatinib,  a human epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor.35 Based on these results, capecitabine is commonly used to treat patients 
with advanced breast  cancer, either as a single agent or as a component of combination 
therapy.   
 
Capecitabine Adverse Events /Toxcity 
 
The main side effects  of capecitabine seen across multiple studies  include: hand -foot 
reaction, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomat itis, dermatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. (see Tables  1-2 below from package insert 
http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/xeloda/pdf/pi.pdf ).   
 
Patients over 80 years old may experience a greater incidence of gastrointestinal grade 3 or 4 
adverse events.   Capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance below 30mL/min or those with known dihydropyrimidine 
dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.  Capecitabine may cause fetal  harm when given to a 
pregnant woman.   It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because 
many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in nursing infants, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued when receiving 
capecitabine therapy.

Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
 
Capecitabine is relatively non -cytotoxic in vitro. This drug is enzymatically converted to 5 -
fluorouracil (5 -FU) in vivo.  Capecitabine is readily absorbed f rom the gastrointestinal tract. 
In the liver, a 60 kDa carboxylesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5' -deoxy-5-
fluorocytidine (5' -DFCR). Cytidine deaminase, an enzyme found in most tissues, including 
tumors, subsequently converts 5' -DFCR to 5' -deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5' -DFUR). The enzyme, 
thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), then hydrolyzes 5' -DFUR to the active drug 5 -FU. 
Many tissues throughout the body express thymidine phosphorylase. Some human 
carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentration s than surrounding normal tissues .36 
Following oral administration of capecitabine 7 days before surgery in patients with 
colorectal cancer, the median ratio of  5-FU concentration in colorectal tumors to adjacent 
tissues was 2.9 (range from 0.9 to 8.0).  
 
The pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites have been evaluated in about 200 
cancer patients over a dosage range of 500 to 3500 mg/m2/day.14,37 Over this range, the 
pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolite, 5' -DFCR were dose proportional and 
did not change over time. The increases in the AUCs of 5' -DFUR and 5 -FU, however, were 
greater than proportional to the increase in dose and the AUC of 5 -FU was 34% higher on 
day 14 than on day 1. The elimination half -life of both parent capecitabine and 5 -FU was 
about 3/4 of an hour. The inter -patient variability in the C max and AUC of 5 -FU was greater 
than 85%.  
 
   
 7 
 Capecitabine reached peak blood levels in about 1.5 hours (T max) with peak 5 -FU levels 
occurring slightly later, at 2 hours. Food reduced both the rate and extent of absorption of 
capecitabine with mean C max and AUC 0-infinity decreased by 60% and 35%, respectively. The 
Cmax and AUC 0-infinity of 5-FU were also reduced by food by 43% and 21%, respectively. Food 
delayed T max of both parent and 5 -FU by 1.5 hours.  Plasma protein binding of capecitabine 
and its metabolites is less than 60% and is not concentration -dependent. Capecitabine was 
primarily bound to human albumin (approximately 35%).  
 
Capecitabine is extensively metabolized enzymatically to 5 -FU. The enzyme 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase hydrogenates 5 -FU, the product of capecitabine 
metabolism, to the much less toxic 5 -fluoro-5, 6-dihydro-fluorouracil (FUH 2). 
Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield 5 -fluoro-ureido-propionic aci d 
(FUPA). Finally, ß -ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to alpha -fluoro-ß-alanine (FBAL) 
which is cleared in the urine.  
 
Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in urine; 95.5% of administered 
capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Fecal excretion is minimal (2.6%). The major 
metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL which represents 57% of the administered dose. About 
3% of the administered dose is excre ted in urine as unchanged drug.  
 
Drug-Drug Interactions:  
(http://www.gene.com/gene/product s/information/xeloda/pdf/pi.pdf ) 
  
Anticoagulants:  In four patients with cancer, chronic administration of capecitabine (1250 
mg/m2 bid) with a single 20 mg dose of warfarin increased the mean AUC of S -warfarin by 
57% and decreased its clearance by 37%. Ba seline corrected AUC of INR in these 4 patients 
increased by 2.8 fold, and the maximum observed mean INR value was increased by 91% .  
Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin -derived anticoagulant therapy 
should have their anticoagulan t response (INR, PT) monitored closely with great frequency 
and the anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.   
 
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: In vitro enzymatic studies with human 
liver microsomes indicated that capecitabine and its metabol ites (5'-DFUR, 5' -DFCR, 5-FU, 
and FBAL) had no inhibitory effects on substrates of cytochrome P450 for the major 
isoenzymes such as 1A2, 2A6, 3A4, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1.  
 
Antacid/ Maalox® (20 mL), an aluminum hydroxide - and magnesium hydroxide -containing  
antacid, was administered immediately after capecitabine (1250 mg/m2, n=12 cancer 
patients), AUC and C max increased by 16% and 35%, respectively, for   capecitabine and by 
18% and 22%, respectively, for 5' -DFCR. No effect was observed on the other three ma jor 
metabolites (5' -DFUR, 5-FU, FBAL) of capecitabine.  
 
Capecitabine has a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions related to plasma protein 
binding. 
 
Based on the standard reference resources from the FDA 
   
 8 
 (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInter
actionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm ) capecitabine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9.   Thus, based  
on the drug interaction table in Appendix C, no medications would be contraindicated.   
 
      2.4  Hypothesis:    Our hypothesis is that use of full weight based chemotherapy dosing will be  
associated with a significantly higher AUC and Cmax.   The results of this study will  advance 
oncologists’ understanding of the potential impact of using limited weight -based dosing for 
capecitabine and provide preliminary data to demonstrate the need evaluate the importance of 
weight-based dosing for other chemothera py and targeted agents.

 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1  Administration  
 
▪  Capecitabine t reatment will be administered on an outpatient  basis with the 
exception that cycle 1 days 1 and 9 will be administered on the Clinical Research 
Unit for pharmacokinetic blood draws . No investigational or commercial agents or 
therapies othe r than those described below may be administered with the intent to 
treat the patient’s malignancy.    
 
▪   The minimum number of hours between capecitabine doses should be 10 hours.  
 
▪   Subjects should then be instructed to take the capecitabine dose 30 m inutes after 
eating a normal meal.  
 
▪   Subjects  will be provided with a Medication Diary for capecitabine, instructed in 
its use, and asked to bring the diary with them to each appointment. Subjects will be 
instructed on what to do if missed, skipped, or vomited dose , and how to record this 
information.  Please see Appendix B for the medication diary template.

 5.2  General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Capecitabine (Xeloda) and Coumadin  
Capecitabi ne (XELODA) Warfarin Interaction: Patients receiving concomitant 
capecitabine and oral coumarin -derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their 
anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin time) monitored frequently in order to 
adjust the anticoagulant do se accordingly. A clinically important XELODA -Warfarin 
drug interaction was demonstrated in a clinical pharmacology trial. Altered coagulation 
parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking 
XELODA concomitantly with coum arin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and 
phenprocoumon. Postmarketing reports have shown clinically significant increases in 
prothrombin time (PT) and INR in patients who were stabilized on anticoagulants at 
the time XELODA was introduced. These  events occurred within several days and up 
to several months after initiating XELODA therapy and, in a few cases, within one 
month after stopping XELODA. These events occurred in patients with and without 
liver metastases. Age greater than 60 and a diagno sis of cancer independently 
predispose patients to an increased risk of coagulopathy.  
 
Bone Metastases:   For patients with documented bony metastases, treatment with 
zolendronic acid, pamidronate or denosumab per standard UWCCC protocol is 
recommended.   
 
Nausea/Emesis:  Patients must be  counseled on the use of antiemetics  for treatment 
of nausea and vomiting with a standard antiemetic regimen  (for example, 
prochlorperazine 10 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for nausea, or lorazepam 0.5 
mg orally every 4  hours as needed for nausea) .  Any patient who is vomiting 
medications or pill fragments should be instructed NOT to repeat dosing.  If nausea 
or emesis leads to the patient feeling lightheaded or dizzy or unable to stay hydrated 
at home should be instruct ed to seek medical attention.  
 
Colony Stimulating Factors :  CSFs should not be used during the first course of 
therapy and should not be used subsequently unless there are significant medical 
circumstances that require CSFs .  Use of any CSFs must be discon tinued at least 24 
hours prior to initiation of the next cycle of chemotherapy and must be documented in 
the patient record.   
 
Diarrhea :  Patients should be instructed prior to cycle 1, day 1 in the proper use of 
antidiarrhea agents (such as loperamide [I modium AD]). For example, with 
loperamide [Imodium AD], instruct patients to take 4 mg (2 capsules) after the first 
loose stool of the day, and 2 mg each loose stool thereafter.  4 mg may be taken every 
4 hours overnight.  Instruct the patient to stop taki ng the Imodium when they have not 
had a bowel movement for 12 hours.  Total daily dose should not exceed 16 mg.  
Patients should be instructed to call for any diarrhea not improved by Imodium.  
 
 
   
 13 
 5.3  Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse even t(s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Disease progression . 
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment . 
 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) . 
 
 Patient decides to withdraw from th e study or is unevaluable after cycle 1 . 
 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient  
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
 Treatment delay greater than 2 weeks  
 
5.4 Duration of Follow Up  
 
All patients enrolled in the study will be followed until both of the following criteria 
are met: 
1.  Study drug is discontinued (for any reason)  
2  All study drug related adverse events have either resolved to grade 1 or stable per 
the discretion of the treati ng physician.    
 
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.3 
applies.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be 
documented in the Case Report Form . 
 
5.6 Definition of Evaluable Patients  
 
Patients will be evaluable for the primary endpoint if he or she takes 100% of their 
capecitabine dose days 1 through 9 and  at least 90% of their cap ecitabine dose  days 
10 through 15  in cycle one.   Unevaluable patie nts will go off study after cycle 1, but 
may continue to be treated with commercial capecitabine per the discretion of the 
treating physician.   
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 General Guidance for Dose Reductions and Modifications  
 
Additional cy cles of therapy may be administered provided that the patient meets the 
following criteria on Day 1 of each cycle:  
 
   
 14 
  ANC > 1,000/mcL  
 Platelets > 75,000/mcL  
 Non-hematologic toxicity recovered to < grade 1   
 No evidence of progressive disease  
 
Dose Modificati ons:  Dose modification for toxicity will be based on the worst toxicity 
observed during the previous course.  Dose modifications apply only when the event(s) are 
felt to be probably or definitely attributable to the study drugs. After recovery, dose 
adjustments for toxicity should be applied as below.  Patients will be instructed to call with 
any new or worsening symptoms between clinical evaluations. Held doses will not be made 
up.  All dose modifications will be permanent and continue through subsequent cycles. 
 
Toxicities which are  manageable with supportive therapy (ie. antiemetics or anti -diarrhea agents 
unless occurring despite maximal medical management. ) do not require dose reductions.  
Toxicities which are determined to be clinically insignificant (ie. Lymphopenia) do not require 
dose reductions.  
 
 If an adverse event is not covered in section 6.2, doses may be reduced or held at the discretion 
of the investigator for the subject’s safety.  
 
Table 3. Capecitabine Dose Levels  
 
 
 Initial Dose  1st reduction 2nd reduction  
Capecitabine  1,250 mg/m2  orally 
twice daily  1,000mg/m2 orally 
twice daily  750mg/m2 orally 
twice daily  
 
Dose delays for more than 2 weeks  or subjects requiring more than 2 dose reductions  will be 
removed from the study . 
 
6.2  Dose modifications  
 
All adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0.  
 
Hematologic toxicity  (Neutropenia, Anemia, Thrombocytopenia) : No dose modification 
for grade 1 -2 toxicities.  For Grade 3 hematologic toxici ty, hold dose until ≤ grade 1  or 
baseline. The may resume  capecitabine with dose reduced to  the next lower dose level. For 
grade 4 hematologic toxicity, the patient should discontinue drug and be removed from study. 
 Consider testing for DPD deficiency.   
 
Stomatitis/pharyngitis and other GI toxicities  (excluding diarrhea, nausea and 
vomiting)  For grade 1-2 toxicities, initiate supportive care measures.  For  grade 3 or 4 
toxicities, hold capecitabine  until the toxicity returns to ≤ grade 1  and then restart 
capecitabine  with a dose reduction to the next lower dose level.  
 
   
 15 
 Diarrhea:  For grade 1 toxicities, initiate supportive care measures such as loperamide.  For 
grade 2 toxicities, hold capecitabine and give loperamide or other anti -diarrhea medications 
until ≤ grade 1, then resume capecitabine at same dose level.  If grade 2 diarrhea occurs a 
second time at a specific dose level, hold capecitabine and give anti -diarrhea medications 
until ≤ grade 1, then resume capecitabine at the next lower dose level.  
 
For grade 3-4 diarrhea, hold capecitabine, start anti -diarrhea medications, and consider iv 
fluids/electrolyte replacement.  Once resolved to ≤ grade 1, then may resume capecitabine at 
the next lower dose level.   
 
Nausea and vomiting:  For grade 1 -2 toxicities, initiate supportive care measures such as 
lorazepam or prochlorperazine.  For grade 3 -4 toxicities (or intolerable grade 2), hold 
capecitabine and give antiemetics and consider iv fluids/electrolytes as needed.  Once 
resolved to  ≤ grade 1, then resum e capecitabine at same dose level unless grade 3 -4 (or 
intolerable grade 2) nausea/vomiting occurred despite maximal medical management (at least 
2 anti-emetics), then reduce by 1 dose level.    
 
Hepatic Toxicity : For grade 1-2 toxicities, no dose adjustme nt required.  For Grade 3-4 
elevation in AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, hold capecitabine 
dose until ≤ grade 1 or back to baseline (whichever is higher).  Then may resume 
capecitabine with  dose  reduced to the next lower dose level . 
 
Hand-foot reaction ( HFR or Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome ): Please see table 
below.   
 
Other toxicity : For other grade 3 or greater toxicities that are considered clinically 
significant by the treating physician and thought to be at least p robably related to study drug, 
hold treatment until toxicity resolves to grade 1 or less, then red uce the dose of capecitabine 
to the next lowest dose level .

7.1 Oversight And Monitoring Plan  
 
The UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is res ponsible for 
monitoring data quality and subject safety for all UWCCC clinical studies.  A 
summary of DSMC activities follows:  
• Review of all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC for data integrity and 
safety 
• Review of all serious adverse events requiring  expedited reporting as defined in 
the protocol  
• Review of reports generated by the UWCCC data quality control review process  
• Submit recommendations for corrective action to the CRC  
• Notify the Study Chair of the DSMC’s recommendation to the CRC  
• Work in con junction with the Health Sciences IRB in the review of protocol 
deviations, violations and unanticipated problems reported by the UWCCC 
DOWGs.  
• The committee ensures that notification is provided to all external sites 
participating in multiple -institutiona l clinical trials coordinated by the UWCCC 
of serious adverse events requiring expedited reporting.  
 
7.2 Monitoring And Reporting Guidelines  
 
Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and subject safety at their weekly 
Phase I/Disease Group meetings  where the results of each subject’s treatment are 
discussed and the discussion is documented in the minutes. The discussion will include 
for each dose level: the number of subjects, significant toxicities as described in the 
protocol, doses adjustments, a nd responses observed. Quarterly  Protocol Summary 
Reports (P SR) are required for submission to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
(DSMC) for review.  
 
7.3 REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS   
 
  a)  Serious Adverse Event – Reported within 7 Days 
  Serious Adverse Events requiring reporting within 7 calendar  days (as described in the 
protocol) will also be sent to the UWCCC DSMC Chair via email to 
saenotify@uwcarbone.wisc.edu. A 7 day “SAE Details” report, generated in the 
UWCCC database must be attached to  the email along with pertinent information 
regarding the SAE and the UWCCC SAE Routing Form. The Committee Chair will 
review the information and determine if further action is required.  This information is 
entered and tracked in the UWCCC database.  
 
 
 
   
 18 
    b)  Study Progress Review  
 Study Progress Review - Protocol Summary Reports  
  Protocol Summary Reports (PSR) are required to be submitted to the DSMC 
commensurate with the Phase of the study. The PSR provides a cumulative report of 
serious adverse events, as well as any protocol violations, deviations or unanticipated 
problems, toxicities and responses that have occurred on the protocol in the timeframe 
specified. PSRs are reviewed at each DSMC meeting.  
  Protocol Summary Reports enable DSMC committee membe rs to assess whether 
significant benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study closure. This 
information is also provided by Disease Oriented Working Group meeting minutes, 
internal audit and/or response review reports.  In addition, the DSMC re quires the 
DOWG or protocol Study Chair to submit external DSMB reports or any other significant 
study-related information.  
  In the event that there is significant risk warranting study suspension or closure, the 
DSMC will notify the PI of the DSMC findi ngs.  The DSMC ensures that the PI reports 
any temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial to the sponsor (e.g., NCI 
Program Director, Industry Sponsor Medical Monitor, Cooperative Group Study Chair, 
etc.) and other appropriate agencies.  
 EXPEDIT ED REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Depending on the nature, severity, and attribution of the serious adverse event an SAE 
report will be phoned in, submitted in writing, or both according to the table below. All 
serious adverse events must also be repo rted to the UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee Chair.  All serious adverse events must also be reported to the UW IRB (if 
applicable), and any sponsor/funding agency not already included in the list.  
 
Determine the reporting time line for the SAE i n question by using the following table.   
 
SAE Requiring 7 Day Reporting Occurs at UWCCC:   
 
1. Report to the UWCCC:

8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION :  CAPECITABINE  

   
 20 
  
Other Names:  Xeloda 
 
Chemical name:  5’-deoxy-5-fluoro-N-[(pentyloxy) carbonyl] -cytidine. 
  
Molecular Weight:   359.35 
 
Description:   Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with antineoplastic activity.  It 
is an orally administered prodrug of 5’ -deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5’ -DFUR) which is 
converted to 5 -fluorouracil.  
 
How Supplied:  Capecitabine (Xeloda) is supplied as biconvex, oblong film -coated tablets 
for oral administration. Each light peach colored tablet contains 150 mg capecitabine and 
each peach -colored tablet contains 500 mg capecitabine.  
    
Solution Preparation : Not appli cable. 
 
Route of Administration:  Oral. 
 
Availability:  Commercial supplies of capecitabine will be used for this study.  
 
Storage and Stability:  Store tightly closed at 25 degrees C (77 degrees F); stable for brief 
periods at 15 to 30 degrees C (59 to 86 deg rees F). 
 
8.1 Adverse events and potential risks  of Capecitabine  (see also tables 1 and 2)  
Hand-and-Foot Syndrome:  Hand-and-foot syndrome (palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia or 
chemotherapy -induced acral erythema) is a cutaneous toxicity (median time to ons et of 79 
days, range from 11 to 360 days).  This is much more commonly observed with capecitabine 
or infusional 5 -FU rather than bolus 5 -FU. 
Cardiotoxicity:  The cardiotoxicity observed with capecitabine includes myocardial 
infarction/ischemia, angina, dysr hythmias, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, sudden death, 
electrocardiographic changes, and cardiomyopathy. These adverse events may be more 
common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease.  
Hepatic Insufficiency:  Patients with mild to mod erate hepatic dysfunction due to liver 
metastases should be carefully monitored when capecitabine is administered. The effect of 
severe hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of capecitabine is not known.  
Hyperbilirubinemia: In the overall clinical trial safety database of capecitabine 
monotherapy (N=875), grade 3 (1.5 -3 x ULN) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 15.2% (n=133) 
and grade 4 (>3 x ULN) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 3.9% (n=34) of 875 patients with 
either metastatic breast or colorectal cancer who  received at least one dose of capecitabine 
1250 mg/m2 twice daily as monotherapy for 2 weeks followed by a 1 -week rest period. Of 
566 patients who had hepatic metastases at baseline and 309 patients without hepatic 
metastases at baseline, grade 3 or 4 hyp erbilirubinemia occurred in 22.8% and 12.3%, 
respectively. Of the 167 patients with grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia, 18.6% (n=31) also 
   
 21 
 had postbaseline elevations (grades 1 to 4, without elevations at baseline) in alkaline 
phosphatase and 27.5% (n=46) had postbaseline elevations in transaminases at any time (not 
necessarily concurrent). The majority of these patients, 64.5% (n=20) and 71.7% (n=33), had 
liver metastases at baseline. In addition, 57.5% (n=96) and 35.3% (n=59) of the 167 patients 
had elevation s (grades 1 to 4) at both prebaseline and postbaseline in alkaline phosphatase or 
transaminases, respectively. Only 7.8% (n=13) and 3.0% (n=5) had grade 3 or 4 elevations in 
alkaline phosphatase or transaminases.  In the 596 patients treated with capecitabi ne as first -
line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia 
was similar to the overall clinical trial safety database of capecitabine monotherapy. The 
median time to onset for grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia in the colorectal cancer population 
was 64 days and median total bilirubin increased from 8 µm/L at baseline to 13 µm/L during 
treatment with capecitabine. Of the 136 colorectal cancer patients with grade 3 or 4 
hyperbilirubinemia, 49 patients had grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia as their last measured 
value, of which 46 had liver metastases at baseline.  
Hematologic:  In 875 patients with either metastatic breast or colorectal cancer who received 
a dose of 1250 mg/m2 administered twice daily as monotherapy fo r 2 weeks followed by a 1 -
week rest period, 3.2%, 1.7%, and 2.4% of patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia or decreases in hemoglobin, respectively.  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis 
and Impairment of Fertility:  Adequate studies investigating t he carcinogenic potential of 
capecitabine have not been conducted. Capecitabine was not mutagenic in vitro to bacteria 
(Ames test) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster V79/HPRT gene mutation assay). 
Capecitabine was clastogenic in vitro to human peripheral blood lymphocytes but not 
clastogenic in vivo to mouse bone marrow (micronucleus test).  
Reproductive: In studies of fertility and general reproductive performance in mice, oral 
capecitabine doses of 760 mg/kg/day disturbed estrus and consequently caused a  decrease in 
fertility. In mice that became pregnant, no fetuses survived this dose. The disturbance in 
estrus was reversible. In males, this dose caused degenerative changes in the testes, 
including decreases in the number of spermatocytes and spermatids.  In separate 
pharmacokinetic studies, this dose in mice produced 5' -DFUR AUC values about 0.7 times 
the corresponding values in patients administered the recommended daily dose.  
Coagulopathy:   See Boxed WARNING regarding interaction with Coumadin in Sectio n 5.2. 
Diarrhea :  Capecitabine can induce diarrhea, sometimes severe. Patients with severe 
diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they 
become dehydrated. This is expected to be common for this combination ther apy. 
Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has been reported with capecitabine.  Toxic deaths have 
been reported for the combination of oxaliplatin with 5 -FU and leucovorin in patients with 
diarrhea and concomitant neutropenia.  Consideration of hospitaliz ing any such patients 
should be given.  
Drug-Drug Interactions  with Capecitabine   
Capecitabine (Xeloda) and Coumadin :  see boxed warning in Section 5.2  
   
 22 
 CYP2C9 substrates:  Other than warfarin, no formal drug -drug interaction studies between 
XELODA and other  CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted. Care should be exercised 
when XELODA is co -administered with CYP2C9 substrates.  
Phenytoin:  The level of phenytoin should be carefully monitored in patients taking 
capecitabine and phenytoin dose may need to be reduce d.  Postmarketing reports indicate 
that some patients receiving capecitabine and phenytoin had toxicity associated with elevated 
phenytoin levels. Formal drug -drug interaction studies with phenytoin have not been 
conducted, but the mechanism of interaction  is presumed to be inhibition of the CYP2C9 
isoenzyme by capecitabine and/or its metabolites.  
 
8.2  Availability  
Capecitabine  (Xeloda®) is an FDA approved medication and is available by prescription at 
pharmacies throughout the United States.  
 
9. CORRELA TIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
9.1 Laboratory Correlative Studies  
 
Capecitabine pharmacokinetics :  Plasma samples for the analysis of capecitabine and 
metabolites (5 -FU, DFCR, and DFUR) will be obtained at baseline (prior to dosing) and 
1, 2, 3, 4, 6,  and 8 hours after administration on day 1 and day 9 of cycle 1  and at steady 
state on cycle 1 days 7 and 15.  Plasma and tissue concentrations will be measured by 
HPLC as previously described.38. For 5FU , the standard curve is linear from 0.019 to 20 
μg/ml, r2 = 0.999, with an intraday variability ranging from 4.49% -5.52% over the 
standard curve.  Inter -day variability over 2 weeks ranges from 4.33 -5.42% over the 
standard curve and the lower limit of quan titation (LLOQ) is 0.0195 μg/ml. For 
capecitabine, the standard curve is linear from 0.019 to 20 μg/ml, r2 = 0.999, with 
intraday variability ranging from 1.2 -7.8% and inter -day variability from 7.6 -13.9% over 
3 months and a LLOQ of 0.019 μg/ml. The standa rd curves for DFCR and DFUR are 
both linear from 0.625 to 40 ug/ml, r2 = 0.999, with an intraday variability ranging from 
4.21%-4.66% and 0.74% -2.08%, interday variability over 4 weeks ranging from 3.45% -
6.36% and 4.24 -6.45% and LLOQ of 0.312 μg/ml and 0.0 195 μg/ml, respectively.  
 
Pharmacokinetic variables will be determined by noncompartmental methods with 
WinNonlin Pro version 5.2 (Pharsight Corporation, Cary, N.C.). Area under the plasma 
concentration –time curve is estimated using the trapezoidal rule fr om time 0 to peak 
concentration and the log -trapezoidal rule from the peak concentration to the last 
measurable plasma concentration (AUClast). AUC(0− ∞) is then calculated from the 
time of dosing and extrapolated to infinity.

11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for r esponse once at 6-
9 weeks (+/ - 1 week) after initiation of therapy, and then per discretion of treating 
physician.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  version 1.1  
(RECIST) Committee [ JNCI 92(3):205 -216, 2000].  Changes in only the largest 
diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST  
1.1 criteria. 
 
11.1.1 Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patien ts will be evaluable for toxicity from the time  of 
their first treatment with capecitabine . 
 
Evaluable for Pharmacokinetic Comparison:   Patients will be evaluable for the 
primary endpoint if he or she takes 100% of their cap ecitabine dose days 1 
through 9 and at least 90% of their cap ecitabine dose  days 10 through 15  in cycle 
one.   
 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have measurable 
disease present at baseline  who have received at least one cycle of therapy  (21 
   
 25 
 days) will be conside red evaluable for response.  These patients will have their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below.   
 
11.1.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at leas t one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) 
as >20 mm with conventional techniques (CT, MRI, x -ray) or as >10 mm with 
spiral CT scan.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions  that are situated in a pre viously irradiated area will  not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm using 
spiral CT  scan), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by 
CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all  non-measurable.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ 
and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified 
as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions s hould 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or 
clinically).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be 
used as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above t he 10 target lesions should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up. 
 
11.1.3 Methods for Evaluati on of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to 
the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of 
the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examinati on when 
   
 26 
 both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x-ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is 
preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   These techniques should be performed with cuts of 10 
mm or less in slice thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT should be performed using 
a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  This applies to tumors of the chest,  
abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually 
require specific protocols.  
 
Ultrasound (US)   When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response 
evaluation, US should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, howe ver, a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph node s 
and subcutaneous lesions. US might also be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.  
 
Endoscopy, La paroscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated.  Their uses in this specific 
context require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may 
only be available in some  centers.  Therefore, the utilization of such techniques 
for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in 
reference centers. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtai ned. 
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can  be used to differentiate between 
partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual 
lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign 
tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neopla stic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or 
stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatme nt) and progressive 
disease. 
 
   
 27 
  
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions . 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target l esions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD . 
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the 
sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded 
since the treatment started or the appearance 
of one or more new l esions. 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for 
PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD 
since the treatment started . 
 
11.1.4.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level . 
 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more non -target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits . 
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearanc e of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions . 
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, 
the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, 
and the progr ession status should be confirmed at a later time by the 
review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progress ion/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
   
 28 
 treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on 
the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria  at least 4 
weeks after initial response is documented .

* In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be

Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to docume nt 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
11.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first r ecorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the tim e measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented.  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking a s reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
 
11.1.6 Progression -free survival :  
Progression -free survival (PFS)  will be defined as time from first dose of 
capecitabine   to time to clinical or imaging evidence of progressive disease. 
 
11.1.7 Response Review  
The imaging for any subjects obtaining a CR or PR will be reviewed centrally at 
the University of Wisconsin  by an independent investigator .

12. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Guidelines a nd instructions for  AE reporting can be found in Section 7.0 (Adverse Eve nt 
 Reporting Requirements).  
 
Study sites are responsible for entering case report forms directly into the Oncore 
database in accordance with the UWCCC data management policy. Data must be 
submitted wit hin 2 weeks of a subject visit and will be monitored mont hly by the Phase I 
Cancer Research office at the UWCCC . 
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
The primary endpoint s are the PK parameters (AUC and Cmax) of capecitabine when  
dosed using actual versus ideal body weight . Secondary endpoints are response and 
progression -free survival.  
 
A single arm study design will be used to characterize the effect on pharmacokinetic 
parameters of capecitabine, when dosed using actual versus id eal body weight. Ideal 
body with based dosing of capecitabine when be used for cycle 1 from day 1 to day 7 
followed by an actual body weight based dosing from Day 9 to Day 15. There will be a 
wash-out period on Day 8.  
 
PK parameters will be summarized in t erms of number of observations, means, standard 
deviations, medians, and ranges, strat ified by assessment time point . The non -
compartmental method will be used to estimate PK parameters. AUC will be estimated 
using the Lagrange approximation method. A pair ed t-test will be used to compare the 
PK parameters between the full weight and limited weight based dosing. If the PK 
parameters are not normally distributed, then an appropriate transformation will be 
identified before conducting the comparison.  The comparison of AUC and Cmax 
between full weight and limited based dosing will be also performed using a population 
pharmacokinetics analysis, based on a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach.  
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
The primary objective is to characterize the effect on pharmacokinetic parameters when 
capecitabine is dosed on actual versus ideal body we ight results in obese patients with 
advanced solid tumors. A mean difference in the AUC and Cmax of at lea st 30% 
between the ideal body weight dos ing versus the actual body with based dosing will be 
considered as a minimal important difference. Based on the results of several previous 
PK studies involving capecitabine, it is anticipated that the o verall standard deviation for 
the difference between the two dosing strategies  is at most 25 % of the mean difference .  
The following table shows the required sample sizes to detect various mean differences 
in PK parameters between the two dosing strategies at the  two-sided 0.025 (=0.05/2 – a 
Bonferroni adjustmen t for comparing both AUC and Cmax)  significance level  with 80% 
   
 30 
 power, assuming a standard deviation ranging from 20 -30%.  
 
Table 13.1: Required sample sizes to detect various mean differences in P K parameters

A sample size of n= 10 patients is proposed for  this study.  With a sample size of 10 
patients, a clinically important difference of 30% betw een the ideal and actual body 
weight based dosing will be detected with 82% power at the one-sided 0.025 (=0.05/2 – a 
Bonferroni adjustment for evaluating both AUC and Cma x) significance level, assuming 
an overall standard deviation of 25%. A mean difference of only 25% will be detected 
with 68% power.  Patients will be evaluable for the primary endpoint if he or she 
completes cycle 1, capecitabine therapy without dose reduc tion or skipped doses.  Any 
patient who does not meet these criteria will be replaced.   
 
The anticipated accrual is 1 -2 patients per month.  Therefore, the study is expected to be 
completed within 6 -12 months after first accrual.  
 
13.3 Stratification Fact ors 
 
n/a 
 
13.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Responses will be determined using RECIST as described in Section12 and summarized 
in tabular format. The complete and partial response rates will be calculated and reported 
along with the corresponding 95% c onfidence intervals. All eligible subjects (intent -to-
treat population) will be included in the calculation of the response rate. Progression -free 
survival will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method.   
PK parameters (based on ideal body weight and actu al body weight) of the study 
participants will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics in terms means, 
standard deviations and ranges. A two-sample t-test will be used to compare the mean 
values in the PK parameters in obese patients with norma l weight historical controls.  
 
13.5 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.5.1 Evaluation of toxicity.  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the 
time of their first treatment with capecitabine.  
 
   
 31 
 13.5.2 Evaluation of response.   All patients included in the s tudy must be assessed 
for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations 
or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following 
categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease,  4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death 
from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not 
assessable  due to measurable disease only or  insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
arbitrary convention, categ ory 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of 
any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception 
of those who received no study medication) should be included in the main 
analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be 
considered to have a treatment failure (disease progression).  Thus, an 
incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in 
exclusion from the analysis of the response  rate. 
 
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.  Subanalyses may 
then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for 
whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to 
other reasons, earl y discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, 
etc.).  However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing 
conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding 
patients from the analysis should be clearly repor ted.  The 95% confidence 
intervals should also be provided.

APPENDIX C:  UWinRx: The University of Wisconsin Policy for Standardizing 
Assessment of CYP Mediated Drug Interaction in Clinical Trials  
 
Effective Date: October 1, 2011  
Version: New  
Section: Phase I  
 
I. Purpose 
The purpose of this policy is to provide a framework for st andardizing assessment of 
cytochrome p450 drug interactions with respect to clinical trial eligibility.  
 
II. Definitions  
A. Investigational drug(s)  is/are the drug(s) being evaluated in the clinical trial as 
determined by the study chair, lead investigator and D rug Interaction Task Force 
(DITF).  In some cases these agents are commercially approved, but for the 
purpose of this policy they will be considered investigational.  
B. Concurrent medications are commercially available prescription and OTC being 
taken by the study subject but not mandated by the study protocol  
C. Pharmacokinetic Definitions  
a. Inhibitors  
i. Strong inhibitor  is one that causes a ≥ 5 -fold increase in the 
plasma AUC values or more than 80% decrease in clearance.  
ii. Moderate inhibitor  is one that causes a ≥  2-fold, but <5 -
fold increase in the plasma AUC values or 50 -79% decrease in 
clearance.  
iii. Weak inhibitor  is one that causes a > 1.25 -fold but < 2 -fold 
increase in the plasma AUC values or 20 -49% decrease in 
clearance.  
b. Inducers are drugs which cause ≥30% chan ge in plasma AUC values.  
Drugs with < 30% change are defined as noninducers.  Lexi -comp defined 
major or moderate inducers are defined as inducers.  
c. Substrates are categorized as sensitive or not sensitive.   
   
 38 
 i. Sensitive refers to drugs whose plasma AUC valu es have been 
shown to increase 5 -fold (CYP3A) or 2 -fold (All other CYP) when 
co-administered with a known inhibitor.  
ii. Lexi-comp defined major substrates are sensitive, minor 
substrates are not sensitive.  
d. Narrow therapeutic index drugs are those where expos ure-response 
indicates that increases in their exposure levels by the concomitant use of 
interacting medications may lead to serious toxicity  
D. Cmax is the maximum plasma concentration of the investigational agent  
E. Ki is the dissociation constant of enzyme i nhibitor, which is needed to categorize 
an agents metabolic profile  
F. IC50 is the inhibitory concentration 50% and is not interchangeable with the Ki.  
G.  Km, or the Michaelis –Menten concentration is when the rate of enzyme binding 
equals the rate of enzyme un binding (steady state).  If the IC50 determination was 
conducted at Km, the Ki=IC50/2  
H. In vitro Definitions  
a. Inhibitors  
Strong inhibitors :  Cmax/Ki ≥ 1  
Moderate inhibitors :  Cmax/Ki  = 0.1 -0.91 
Weak inhibitors :  Cmax/Ki <  0.1  
b. Inducers: > 100% increase in e nzyme activity  
c. Substrates  
Sensitive: ≥ 30% of metabolism occurs via a given CYP  
Not sensitive: < 30% of metabolism occurs via a given CYP  
 
III. Policy 
a. UWCCC clinical trials must include a section in the protocol or a “cheat sheet” in 
Oncore that defines the me tabolic pathway (CYP enzyme and whether it is a 
substrate, (sensitive or not sensitive), inducer or inhibitor (strong, moderate or 
weak) of the investigational agent as well as the contraindicated concurrent 
medications.   
   
 39 
 b. If there is no metabolic pathway section in the protocol, the study chair and/or 
lead investigator will prepare this section of the protocol or cheat sheet.  
c. The DITF, or subcommittee of the DITF, including one medical oncologist and 
one pharmacist, has responsibility for reviewing and app roving the metabolic 
pathway section within 1 week.  
d. Patient concurrent medications,  
i. Medications including route and schedule, for study candidates will be 
collected by Phase I nurses by patient interview  
ii. List will be reviewed and categorized (CYP enzyme and whether it 
is a substrate, inducer and inhibitor) by PRC.   
e. Pharmacokinetic definitions from previous in vivo trials are the preferred method 
for categorizing interaction potential.  In vitro data (Ki values) will be utilized if 
clinical definitions ar e not available.  
f. If only IC50 values are available, they should be converted to Ki values, as 
recommended by Cer et al, using the relationship Ki=IC50/2 with the assumption 
that the IC50 was conducted at the Km.  
g. The most recent version of the Drug Informat ion Handbook (Lexi -Comp) will be 
used as the primary reference for assessment of interaction potential of concurrent 
medications.  This reference is updated annually.  The secondary references will 
be Micromedix and drug information leaflets (package inser ts). 
h. The most recent version of the investigational drug brochure (IDB) will be used 
for assessment of interaction potential of the investigational agent.  
i. Transdermal products designed for systemic delivery must be assessed for 
interaction potential.  Topi cal products not designed to provide systemic delivery, 
(including inhaled products, ophthalmologic products and transvaginal 
preparations) do not need to be considered since they do not have appreciable 
systemic absorption.  
j. All protocol mandated anti -cancer medications will be considered to be “narrow 
therapeutic index” drugs  
k. Concurrent medication that are “narrow therapeutic index” are defined as agents 
where a  small change in plasma concentrations may result in substantial clinical 
impact, such as warfa rin and drugs that affect the QT interval (Class I and III 
antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, azoles, bepridil, dolasetron,  fluoroquinolones, 
   
 40 
 fluoxetine, loratadine, macrolide antibiotics, methadone, ondansetron, 
phenothiazines,  sulfamethoxazole, tolterodi ne, trazodone, tricyclic 
antidepressants, trimethoprim).  Definition of narrow therapeutic index will be 
left to physician discretion  
 
IV. Procedure for Eligibility Determination  
a. Phase I office will review medication regimens, including OTCs ; and email this 
medication profile to the PRC.  
b. PRC will evaluate investigational agents and concurrent medications for 
interactions using table 1 or as stipulated in the protocol and categorize 
medications as Contraindicated, Use with Caution or Allowed.  
i. PRC will determine  the metabolic pathway of the investigational agent 
from the cheat sheet or protocol and locate on grey panel of table 1.  
ii. PRC will determine the metabolic pathway of each concurrent 
medication from the most recent version of Lexi -Comp and locate on pink 
panel of table 1.  
iii. PRC will determine the intersecting box.  
c. Contraindicated medications must be discontinued for a patient to be eligible for 
the clinical trial.  Since time frame for discontinuation will vary with type of 
interaction and drug half -life, this will be determined on a case by case basis by 
the study chair, PCR and/or DITF.  
d. If patient is on one or more “Use with Caution” medications, the study chair and 
treating physician must be contacted for an eligibility determination.  
e. Allowed medications ar e allowed without consultation with the study chair or 
treating physician

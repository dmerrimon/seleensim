approximately 928 trial participants, and the estimated number 
of participants enrolled will be approximately 1092 taking into 
account screen failures. 
Intervention Single oral 3 g dose of zoliflodacin granules as oral suspension 
Comparator  Combination of a s ingle intramuscular 500 mg dose of 
ceftriaxone and a single oral 1 g dose of azithromycin 
Statistical analysis  The microbiological intent -to-treat (micro-ITT) population will 
be used as the primary analysis population for the assessment 
of microbiological cure. The micro -ITT population will include all 
randomized participants who receive a dose of drug, who have 
urogenital NG  isolated at baseline and who are not infected with 
a strain that shows resistance to both ceftriaxone and azithromycin at baseline
.  
The primary efficacy analysis will claim that zoliflodacin is non-
inferior to the ceftriaxone -azithromycin combination if the 
upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
microbiological cure rate of the combination therapy minus 
zoliflo dacin will be 12% or less (prespecified non-inferiority 
margin for the primary endpoint).  
Complementary 
activities  Microbiological bacterial isolates collected will be stored for 
long -term (no longer than 5 years, with the exception of the 
Netherlands where bacterial isolat es will be kept up to 15 years 

 1. Background and trial rationale 
1.1. Background information 
Bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI) are a major public health concern globally, 
affecting over 357 million people every year (1). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), the etiological 
agent of gonorrhoea, is estimated to have caus ed 78 million infections in 2012.  The Western 
Pacific and African regions have the highest in cidence of gonococcal infections worldwide, 
with 89 and 50 cases per 100’000 population re spectively. Rates of male urethral discharge 
(UD), which is primar ily due to NG or Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), are also highest for these 
two regions, amounting to 567 per 100’000 in  Africa and 141 per 10 0’000 in the Western 
Pacific. In high income countrie s (HIC), gonorrhoea is also raising significant concerns. In the 
United States of America (USA) it  is the second most frequently reported notifiable infectious 
diseases, with over 600’000 infections reported per year (2).  NG has been included as one of 
three organisms presenting an urgent threat due to progressive antimicrobial resistance by 
the US Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention (US CDC) (3). 
Gonorrhoea affects both men and women. In men, infections commonly manifest as 
urethritis. Symptoms develop in 75% of the men wi thin four to eight days of genital infection 
and in 80 to 90% within two weeks (4). UD is the most frequent presenting symptom and is 
often undistinguishable from non-gonococcal urethritis ( e.g. CT infections). Acute unilateral 
epididymitis can be a complication of gonococcal  infection, although it is more common with  
CT infections (5, 6). In women, gonococcal infections are often ( ≥50% of the cases) 
asymptomatic. Genital infections, in particul ar cervical infections, are the most common 
infections. When symptomatic, cervical in fection typically manifests as mucopurulent 
discharge. If left untreated, NG infections can ascend to involve the uterus and fallopian tubes. Gonorrhoea is associated with significant morbid ity and if not treated appropriately, can have 
serious consequences on reproductive health. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic 
pregnancies, abortions, neonatal conjunctivitis and blindness are among the possible 
complications. Studies have also shown that go norrhoea enhances the transmission of human 
HIV by three to five-fold (7-9). 
Most individuals with gonorrhoea are managed in the community, and clinical management 
is often empiric and syndromic: treatment is based on the presence of easily recognized signs 
(e.g. urethral or vaginal discharge), and the provision of antibiotics that deal with the majority 
of, or the most serious, organisms responsible for the syndrome. Extended spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) constitute the mainstay  of gonorrhoea treatment. However, with 
increasing resistance to ESC emerging globally, and in particular to cefixime, several countries switched around 2013 from ESC monotherapy to  a dual therapy that includes an injectable 
ESC – ceftriaxone- and azithromycin (10, 11), the underlying, unproven, assumption being that a dual therapy would slow down resistance emergence.  
Over the past few years, the World Health Organization (WHO) and others have raised 
concerns over the spread of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance (AMR), warning that infections due to  NG may soon become untreatable (12-14). Reports of treatment failures 
with ESC and azithromycin monotherapy have mu ltiplied over the past few years, and clinical 
failures to dual therapy have been reported  (15-17). Despite this, the drug development 
pipeline for NG remains insufficient. In 2012, th e WHO launched a global action plan to control 
the spread and impact of AMR in NG . Identifying new treatment options for multi-drug 
resistant (MDR) gonorrhoea is a key element of the WHO global action pl an, and has long been 

 called for by clinicians and microbiologists (18, 19). 
1.2. Zoliflodacin development 
Zoliflodacin (ETX0914) belongs to a new cla ss of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA ) replication. It shows in vitro  antibacterial activity against several 
Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp . and Streptococcus spp . as well as 
fastidious Gram-negative pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis  
and NG (20).  Minimum inhibitory concentration requir ed to inhibit the growth of 90% of 
organisms (MIC 90) values for NG range from 0.125 to 0.25 μg/mL.   
A complete program of both oral and intravenou s (IV) toxicity studies was performed in the 
rat and dog. Data collected included clinical  observations, body weight changes, food 
consumption, clinical pathology and histopathology. Also completed was a battery of genetic toxicology studies and single dose safety ph armacology studies to assess cardiovascular, 
central nervous system, renal, respiratory and gastrointestinal endpoints.  
Studies performed in the Staphylococcus aureus  (S. aureus ) neutropenic thigh model, which 
was the surrogate pathogen model available at the time, indicated that the ratio between the 
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and the MIC was the driver of log kill. Those 
studies also supported a predicted efficacious mean AUC in humans of 49 μg*hour(h)/mL. 
Overall, the preclinical data supported progression  to phase I trials (20, 21). More recently, 
dose-ranging studies using a hollow fibre infection model  (HFIM) for NG confirmed  the 
exposure-response previously generated with S. aureus  that, accounting for PK variability in 
human, zoliflodacin should be administered as a single oral dose of 3g to provide effective 
killing of NG while suppressing emergence of resistance (22).  
Detailed results of these pre-clinical evaluati ons are summarized in the investigator brochure 
(IB).  
Zoliflodacin is being developed as an oral, single  dose treatment. Final data is available from 
six clinical trials : a phase I single-ascending do se (SAD) trial, a phase I absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, excretion (ADME) trial (23), a phase II trial involving participants with confirmed 
urogenital gonococcal infection (24), a pha se I relative bioavailability (rBA) trial 
(clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a phase I food ef fect trial with healthy volunteers to assess 
the effect of food on the PK characteristics of  a newly developed formulation (clinicaltrials.gov 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and a thorough QT/Q Tc (TQT) trials (25). The SAD and ADME trials showed that 
zoliflodacin was well tolerated at all doses test ed (200 mg- 4’000 mg). The most frequently 
reported AEs in both healthy volunteers and patients with uncomplicated gonorrhoea were 
headache, nausea and diarrhea. Dysgeusia, which is the preferred term for ‘unpleasant taste’ 
in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Ac tivities (MedDRA), was reported by healthy 
volunteers receiving an old zoliflodacin formulatio n, which is not the form ulation used in this 
trial.  
In the phase II, 96% (95%CI: 88-100%) cure rate s were observed with both the 2 g and the 3 g 
doses in the micro-ITT population at the urogen ital site (55 out of 57 and 54 out of 56 
participants respectively) compared to 100%  (95% CI:88-100) in the comparator arm of 
ceftriaxone 500 mg IM (24). All participants wi th concomitant rectal infections were cured 
with either dose of zoliflodacin, while for th ose with concurrent oropharyngeal infections, 
cure rates were lower (2 g 50% [95%CI: 16-84] ; 3 g 82% [95%CI: 48-98]) compared to 100% 
(95%CI: 40-100) for ceftriaxone. The small number of participants with concurrent 

 oropharyngeal infections included in  the phase II (8 participants in  the 2 g arm, 11 participants 
in the 3 g arm and 4 in the ceftriaxone arm)  however precludes any firm conclusion about 
efficacy at this site. In the phase II, the safety profile of zoliflodacin was generally similar to 
ceftriaxone; the most common adverse events (excluding infection-related AEs) were diarrhoea, headache, and nausea. The drug  was overall generally well tolerated. 
1.3. Overall rationale for the trial 
Despite growing concerns over progressive antimicrobial resistance, the development 
pipeline for uncomplicated gonorrhoea remains relatively empty with only two new chemical 
entities (NCE) currently in development: zolifl odacin and gepotidacin. Gepotidacin, for which 
with single dose treatment a few microbiological failures occurred in phase 2, especially in isolates with high baseline MICs (26), is bein g tested in phase III as a 2-dose treatment for 
uncomplicated gonorrhoea. As fluoroquinolone resistance is already extremely prevalent globally (27), the use of gepotidacin will have to be restricted to cases where the antimicrobial 
susceptibility pattern of the infecting strain is  known. Zoliflodacin (AZD0914) on the other 
hand, has shown extremely good activity against a large collection of isolates (standard and 
clinical), from different geographical origin s, including multi-drug resistant (MDR) and 
extremely drug resistant (XDR) strains (28-31). In vitro  studies clearly show the absence of 
cross-resistance between zoliflodacin and pre- existing fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin 
resistance mechanism (32). The frequency of  spontaneous resistance to zoliflodacin in vitro  
was found to be low and comparable to freque ncies reported for fluoroquinolones (1.5x10
-8 
to 5.2x10-9 at 4x MIC) (33-35). 
The utility of commercialized readily-available  drugs as new treatments for uncomplicated 
gonorrhoea has been investigated in a few tr ials. For example, a 4-arm trial (NABOGO) was 
conducted in the Netherlands to formally eval uate ertapenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin 
compared to ceftriaxone (36). Preliminary data shows that ertapenem , but not gentamicin 
nor fosfomycin, was non-inferior to ceftriax one. Nevertheless, ertapenem must also be 
administered intramuscularly, like ceftriaxon e. In case resistance to the currently 
recommended therapies reaches the critical th reshold of 5% set by WHO and other public 
health agencies, it could have some utility be fore a new molecule comes to market. However, 
it does not provide a long-term solution an d have well-known drawbacks as the MIC of 
ertapenem is affected by the ESC resistance de terminants (37). In contrast, zoliflodacin has 
proven to be an excellent clinical candidate both  in terms of efficacy and safety. The drug is 
well tolerated, can be administered orally a nd has shown high rates of cure for urethral, 
cervical and rectal gonococcal  infection in phase II (24). 
In summary, zoliflodacin is a new promising option to address the risk posed by the threat of 
drug-resistant gonorrhoea. The purpose of this phase III multi-center, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial is to confirm the efficacy  and safety outcomes observed in the phase II 
trial and to generate the necessary evidence to  support a marketing authorization application 
in the USA, the European Union (EU), South Africa and Thailand.

return to the clinic on Day 2 for further blood sa mpling. Site staff will call all participants on 
Day 3 for safety monitoring purposes and to en quire about sex behaviour since the previous 
clinic visit. Participants will retu rn to the clinic on Day 6 for th e TOC visit, involving safety and 
efficacy assessments (primary endpoint for th e trial will be assessed at the TOC visit). Those 
participants that will a posteriori have been diagnosed with a CT infection via NAAT at baseline 
and who were randomised to the zoliflodacin arm will then be treated for the CT infection as per standard of care. All participants will be as ked to return to the clinic for the EOT visit on 
Day 30 for final safety and efficacy assessments. For further details on the schedule of assessments refer to Section 5.

Note: Culture and NAAT assessments at visits 4 and 5 are condit ional to results at previous visits as per the schedule of 
assessments (Section 5).
3.2. Rationale 
3.2.1. Justification for trial design
The choice of a non-inferiority trial design is based on the fact that an efficacious treatment 
already exists for uncomplicated gonorrhoea , although not all participants achieve 
microbiological cure. Given the high cure rate  achieved with the ceftriaxone/azithromycin 
combination ( ≥95%) it would be unethical to conduct a placebo-controlled trial. It would also 
be unfeasible to show superiority of zoliflodaci n. On the other hand, zoliflodacin offers some 
advantages over the ceftriaxone/azithromycin combination: it has in-vitro activity against 
azithromycin-, cefixime- and ceftriaxone- resistant strains and it is an oral treatment while ceftriaxone is an injectable treatment. A non-inferiority design is therefore justified and is consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for industry (38).Justification for the non-inferiority margin is available in Section 11.1 .
3.2.2. Justification for investig ational drug dose selection 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets have not been developed or established

 specifically for NG in animal or human studies. Because of spontaneous eradication of the 
bacteria, proven adequate animal models of gonococcal infection do not exist and a mouse S. 
aureus  neutropenic thigh model was used as a surrogate to determine the human dose for 
zoliflodacin (20). Based on the S. aureus  trial, the highest MIC observed to date (0.25 mg/litre 
[L]) and data from the SAD phase I trial, doses of 2 g and 3 g were investigated in the phase II trial. The key assumption behind dose selection was that the PK/PD index best associated with 
clinical efficacy was AUC/MIC (20). In the phase II trial, high cure rates were achieved with 
both a 2 g and a 3 g dose. In the primary analysis of the micro-ITT population, 55 of 57 (96.5%, 
CI: [87.8%, 99.6%]) infected participants in th e zoliflodacin 2 g arm achieved microbiological 
cure at the urethral/cervical site. Of the 56 infe cted participants in the zoliflodacin 3 g arm, 54 
(96.4%, CI: [87.7%, 99.6%]) achieved microbiologi cal cure and of the 28 infected participants 
in the ceftriaxone arm, all 28 (100%, CI: [87.7% , 100%]) achieved microbiological cure. In the 
secondary analysis of the per protocol (PP) po pulation, 48 of 49 (98.0%, CI: [89.2%, 99.9%]) 
infected participants in the zoliflodacin 2 g arm achieved microbiological cure at the 
urethral/cervical site. Of the 47 infected particip ants in the zoliflodacin 3 g arm, all 47 (100%, 
CI: [92.5%, 100%]) achieved microbiological cure . Of the 21 infected participants in the 
ceftriaxone arm, all 21 (100%, CI: [83.9% , 100%]) achieved microbiological cure. 
Microbiological cures at the rectal and pharyngeal sites were also investigated in the Phase II 
trial. Further details are available in the IB. Th e phase II trial used a compounded suspension 
of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in an aqueous vehicle containing standard 
excipients. This formulation was not commercially  viable, hence a granule for oral suspension 
formulation has been developed for further testin g in clinical trials and commercialization. 
The rBA trial (clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and the final data from the food effect trial 
(Clinicaltrials.gov NCT  03718806) showed that the expo sure achieved with granule 
formulation is comparable to that achieved with the aqueous suspension formulation. The PK characteristics measured during thes e trials may be found in the IB.  
PK/PD modelling suggests that a 3 g dose of the granule formulation will result in an AUC of 
30500 ng•h/mL (5%-95% quantile bounds: 9960  - 78400 ng•h/mL) an d 53600 ng•h/mL (5%-
95% quantile bounds: 22400 - 107000 ng•h/mL) in  fasted and fed subjects respectively. These 
values are comparable to the AUC achieved with a 3 g dose of the previous aqueous 
suspension formulation. Additional information can be found in the IB. 
Based on those results, to maximize cure rates both at urogenital and extra-genital sites and 
to cover isolates with higher MICs, a 3 g dose was selected as the final dose for the phase III 
trial. This dose was well tolerated in both phas e I and II studies. To further support a 3 g dose, 
results of dose-ranging HFIM experiments with NG recently confirmed that, accounting for PK 
variability in human, a 3 g dose provides effect ive killing of NG while suppressing emergence 
of resistance (22). It thus appears that the 3 g dose provides the best benefit/risk ratio.  
3.2.3.  Justification for comparator selection 
The present trial will be the first global trial investigating a new antimicrobial that aims at 
addressing a global public health need. The Global Antibiotic Research and Development 
Partnership (GARDP) overarching goal is to c onduct a single phase III trial that meets the 
regulatory requirements of the US FDA, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), the Thai Food and Drug Administration (Thai FDA) and the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA), and that enables regi stration and roll out of zoliflodacin in those 
countries. However, a major challenge is to  choose a unique comparator against which 
zoliflodacin can be evaluated in a scientifically robust way.  

 The comparator for this trial is a single combination of an IM dose of 500 mg ceftriaxone and 
a 1 g oral dose of azithromycin. The rational e for use of this combination is to compare 
zoliflodacin to the first line treatment recommended by most current national and 
international guidelines (see Table 2). With rega rds to the dose of ceftriaxone, a 500 mg dose 
was chosen for the following reasons: 
1) Dosages of ceftriaxone up to 1 g have proven safe and are approved for use in various 
indications by all regulatory agencies cited above. A dose of 500 mg ceftriaxone is recommended for first line treatment of un complicated gonorrhoea in the US and the 
EU and for re-treatment/treat ment failure by WHO guidelines for the treatment of NG 
(39-41). 
2) There is currently no firm clinical evidence  to support (or to oppose) a 500 mg versus 
a 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone for treatment of gonorrhoea. However, modelling data suggests a higher dose may achieve higher log kill, in particular in situation where MICs 
are in the upper range (40, 42). It is generally assumed that the clinical efficacy of β-
lactam antibiotics relates to fT > MIC and experiments conducted by Jaffe and 
colleagues found that penicillin efficacy in male urethritis was predicted by total ( i.e. 
serum-bound plus free) penicillin levels at least four times above the MIC for at least 
10 h, roughly corresponding to an fT > MIC of 7–10 h (43). For cephalosporins, 
Chisholm et al. postulated that an fT > MIC of 20–24 h is needed for efficacy with cephalosporins (42). This is unlikely to be achieved by a 250 mg dose while it is very likely by a 500 mg dose. 
3) At the moment the ceftriaxone MICs are still largely within the susceptible range 
(≤0.125 μg/ml) and 250 mg dose is likely to achieve sufficient exposure to cover most 
isolates. However, MIC "creep" is being observed in several countries, including in South Africa and Thailand, and reports of tr eatment failures have been published from 
several countries internationally (28, 44, 45). In the WHO Southeast Asian Region, 
decreased susceptibility or resistance to ceftriaxone was noted by 50% (3/6) of the 
countries (Bhutan, India, and Indonesia) reporting ceftriaxone susceptibility data in 2014; 33% (2/6; India and Indonesia) reported ≥ 5% decreased susceptibility or 
resistance (27). From 2009 to 2014, 83% (5/6) of countries reported isolates with 
decreased susceptibility or resistance to  ceftriaxone, and 50% (3/6) reported ≥ 5% 
decreased susceptibility or resistance (27). The latest estimates from China also show 
that between 9.7% and 12.2% of the isolates have decreased susceptibility to ESC (46). 
In essence, this means that by the time zolif lodacin is licensed it is likely that the WHO-
recommended dosage of ceftriaxone will ha ve also increased. Several countries 
already use 500 mg to 1 g of ceftriaxone ( e.g. China, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan 
and the US). Comparing zoliflodacin to 500 mg dose of ceftriaxone during the phase III will therefore bring more meaningful data to support registration.  
4) Based on the assumption above, showing non-inferiority of zoliflodacin to 500 mg of 
ceftriaxone + 1 g azithromycin will be more  conservative, as well as more widely 
applicable than if a 250 mg  ceftriaxone dose + 1 g azithromycin was used as a 
comparator. 
5) This dosage was used in other gonorrhoea tria ls, including the zoliflodacin phase II trial, 
and achieved high cure rates and excellent safety profile.  
6) The combination of ceftriaxone with azithrom ycin is the standard of care in many 
countries (See Table 2). 

 3.2.4.  Justification for exclusion of CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In the initial development of zoliflodacin a physiologically-based PK (PBPK) model 
incorporating physicochemical properties, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion of zoliflodacin was developed to invest igate the systemic exposure of the drug after 
oral administration to healthy adults and dete rmine the potential for drug-drug interactions 
(DDIs) (see IB for details). Based on the output of these simulations using data derived from 
the original amorphous formulation, the totality of the data indicated that zoliflodacin has low 
potential for significant DDIs across a broad ra nge of CYP P450s and transporters except 
CYP3A4. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors were predicte d to have a modest impact on zoliflodacin 
(~1.3 fold increase on Cmax and a 2.4 - 2.6 fold  increase in AUC) while moderate to strong 
CYP3A4 inducers have the potential to reduce zoliflodacin exposure below what is required 
for efficacy.  
The increase in AUC predicted by physiologically-based PK model in zoliflodacin in the 
presence of strong inhibitors (ketoconazole an d ritonavir) was used directly to adjust the 
typical value estimate of clearance (tvCL) in  the population PK model. The population PK 
model was then used to conduct Monte Carlo si mulations of a virtual patient population. In 
this manner the potential effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor on the simulated PK could be 
considered across fed/fasted status and body weight range. 
In light of the substantive food effect observed in the recent Phase I Food Effect study 
(DNDi/GARDP STI_Zoli002) of the new imme diate release formulation ("Phase III 
formulation"), the Sponsor has unde rtaken further in silico evalua tion of the potential impact 
of CYP3A4 inhibition on zoliflodacin exposure using the refined population PK model used to 
extrapolate exposure in lower body weight rang es of 35 to 50 kg; for these analyses, the 
potential effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor on  zoliflodacin concentrations was considered by 
reducing the tvCL value in the model by 2.37 an d 2.61 fold based upon mean predicted fold 
changes in AUC (derived from SimCYP simula tions) with ketoconazole and ritonavir as 
inhibitors. 
Output of Monte Carlo simulations for a 3000 mg  dose utilizing these predicted fold changes 
in AUC of zoliflodacin in the presence of each  strong CYP3A4 inhibitor suggested the highest 
mean Cmax achieved in the lowest bodyweight of 35 kg (weight cut-off limit in the ongoing 
Phase III study GARDP STI_Zoli001), would be nearly equivalent to the maximum 
concentration that has been observed clinica lly; i.e. mean geometric mean Cmax of 37.5 
μg/mL in subjects administered a 4000 mg (“Ph ase III formulation”) with a high fat meal.  
Based on this analysis, the Sponsor concluded that it was prudent to prohibit concomitant 
dosing of zoliflodacin with moderate/strong CY P3A4 inhibitors until further clinical and PK 
data are available from PK subset groups in the present Phase III study and from a planned study that is investigating drug-drug interact ions and food effect (STIZoli_003, EudraCT 
number 2020-000379-19). 
 
3.2.5.  Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on trial conduct and contingency measures 
The COVID-19 pandemic is providing unprecedented challenges to all healthcare workers 
and patients in general and for recruitment and running of clinical trials.  
GARDP therefore took, and continues to take, co ntingency measures to mitigate the impact 
of the pandemic on the trial, to support site staff and patients, and to minimise risks to 

 them, while being able to continue recruitmen t to the trial and to guarantee data quality 
and integrity.  
Contingency measures are described in a separate COVID-19 mitigation plan.  
  
3.3. Randomization 
The randomization sequence will be obtained by computer-generated random numbers and 
provided to each trial site through a web-base d randomization system. Trial participants will 
be assigned to receive either zoliflodacin or a ceftriaxone/azithromycin combination in a 2:1 
allocation ratio. Unequal randomization has been chosen to increase the number of individuals from which safety data is gath ered. Randomisation will be performed using 
random permutated blocks of 3, 6, and 9 with stratification by sex at birth and with each block maintaining the 2:1 randomisation. At each tr ial site, a dedicated pharmacist or designated 
clinician will be responsible for monitoring drug storage and for dispensing trial drugs in 
accordance with the treatment allocation. 
3.4. Blinding 
This will be an open-label trial. With a d ouble-dummy design, participants would have to 
receive an IM injection and a tablet as well as an oral sachet, which would be likely to decrease 
their willingness to participate in the trial.  Moreover, placebo injections might not be 
acceptable from an ethical perspective, and as a consequence the majority of gonorrhoea trials conducted over the past 30 years that included ceftriaxone treatment arm have been 
unblinded trials.  
Nevertheless, the laboratory staff who performs  assessment of the primary outcome will be 
blinded to treatment allocation. This is achievable as the treatment allocation will not be mentioned on the trial specimen sent to the laboratory. Samples collected throughout the 
trial will be anonymized and a unique participan t identifier will be used for sample tracking 
and result reporting. Laboratory results will be entered in the electronic case report form (eCRF) by site staff, or reported directly to  data management as per pre-determined data 
specifications. For sites participating in the PK su b-study, it will be ensured that trial personnel 
handling PK samples are different from the la boratory personnel handling microbiological 
samples.  
With the exception of medical monitors and coun try specific personnel who interact regularly 
and are required to advise unblinded site teams, the sponsor remains blinded as detailed in the Blinding convention document. All the data  will remain blinded to the sponsor until 
database lock, except in case of expedited re porting of suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction (SUSAR). 
3.5. Trial duration  
The planned total duration for individual particip ants will be 30 days (± 3 days). The trial 
treatment will be a single dose of either the investigational treatment or the comparator 
treatment. The duration of the follow-up period w ill be 29 days (± 3 days). The end of the trial 
is defined as the last participant’s last visit. Ov erall and taking into consideration an evaluation 
of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on recruitment, recruitment into the trial is expected to last for approximately 3.5 years.

9. HIV testing is mandatory only for participants to the PK sub-study. For all other participants, HIV testing is proposed, but no t mandatory for inclusion in the study. An HIV test result obta ined on the day of 
enrolment may be used as baseline assessme nt. Participants with a documented positive  HIV diagnosis or documented prescription of ART also do not need to be tested again.  
10. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and total and di rect bilirubin (direct bilirubin only required if total bilirubin is elevated)  
11. A Gram stain result obtained on the day of enrolment may be used as baseline assessment 
12. In cases where both baseline NG NAAT and NG culture results are ne gative, no further samples should be taken at subsequent visi ts. This applies to each anatomical site respectively.  
13. Only take sample if:  
- symptoms at any anatomical site  are present. If symptoms at an y anatomical site are observed, take samples from all 3 anatomi cal sites. 
- a negative culture and a positive NG NAAT results were obtained  at TOC. This applies to each anatomical site respectively.

Changes in health and concomitant medications will be recorded from signature of the 
informed consent until the EOT visit. See Section 8for further details on adverse events.
5.2.1. Visit 1: Day 1 (-1 day)
Assessments for Visit 1 can be performed over 2 days as long as ALL Baseline assessments 
and Dosing are performed on the 2nd day. The day that is considered Day 1 is the day of 
Dosing. 
Screening Day 1 (-1 day)
After signing the informed consent, participants will be asked demographic information, 
including date of birth (only year of birth and age will be reported  in the eCRF), gender, sex at 
birth and ethnicity. Eligibility cr iteria will be reviewed, and a complete medical history, and 
sexual history over the past 3 months will be ob tained as part of this process. A targeted 
physical examination will be performed (the ph ysical examination perf ormed at screening will 
be regarded as the baseline), including a clinic al assessment of gonorrhoea, as well as a urine 
pregnancy test for females of child-bearing potential.
For participants taking part in the PK sub-study , randomization can occur on Day -1 (Screening) 
once eligibility has been confirmed, and participants can return to complete Day 1 baseline assessments and receive study treatment the follow ing calendar day, to assist with scheduling 
of the visit.
Baseline (Day 1) 
Eligible participants will be randomised to ei ther the zoliflodacin or the comparator group. 
They will then undergo baseline assessments, including safety laboratory tests and HIV rapid testing if applicable. HIV testing is mandatory on ly for participants to the PK sub-study. For all 
other participants, HIV testing is proposed, bu t not mandatory for inclusion in the study. An 
HIV test result obtained on the day of enro lment may be used as baseline assessment. 
Participants with a documented positive HIV diagnosis or documented prescription of ART do not require repeat testing. Swabs will also be taken for microbiology outcomes (1 swab for NG 
culture and 1 swab for NG/CT NAAT evaluations ) from the urethra or cervix, rectum and 
pharynx. 
Absorption of zoliflodacin and tolerability of azithromycin tablets are improved when patients 
are fed, and not fasted. Therefore, food must be taken before trial treatment. Details on 
timing of food intake in relation with dosing time and required food content are available in 
the MOP. The date and time of last food intake  prior to trial treatment administration will be 
captured.
Once ALL baseline assessments are completed, participants will receive trial treatment.Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken as per schedule described in Section 7.3from those 
participants who will have signed the PK sub-study informed consent.
5.2.2. Visit 2: Day 2 - PK sub-study
Visit 2 is for participants enrolled in  the PK sub-study only. See Section 7.3for further details.

 5.2.3.  Visit 3: Day 3 (-1 day) 
On day 3, the medical staff will call participants on the phone to enquire about their health 
condition and sexual history since the last visit. This day is not a clinic visit. 
5.2.4.  Visit 4: Day 6 (+/-2 days) 
At the TOC visit, participants will undergo sa fety lab assessments, a physical examination 
including a clinical assessment of gonorrhoea, and females of child-bearing potential will 
perform a urine pregnancy test. Males at birth will  be assessed for clinical cure as per guidance 
in the MOP. Sexual history since the previous vi sit will also be assessed. The medical staff will 
enquire with the participant whether they ex perienced any potential AE and took any 
medication since the last visit. 
Swabs will be collected for microbiology outcome s (1 swab for NG cult ure and 1 swab for NG 
NAAT evaluations) from each anatomical site (u rogenital, rectal and pharyngeal), unless both 
NG culture and NG NAAT results at that specific  anatomical site were negative at baseline. 
In case ANY of the NG microbiological test result s for a specific anatomical site is not available 
prior to the collection of the TOC visit specim ens, both NG culture and NAAT microbiology 
specimens should be collected for that particular anatomical site and microbiological evaluations should be performed. 
Once all specimens are collected, participants randomised to the zoliflodacin arm with a 
positive CT NAAT at baseline will be treated for CT infection as per local standard of care.  
If a participant returns for a TOC visit outside the allowed time window, the primary TOC 
assessments will be considered missed and the participant will therefore be regarded as a 
treatment failure for primary endpoint analysis. It is therefore of crucial importance to ensure 
all participants have a TOC visit within th e allowed time window (Day 6 +/- 2 days). 
5.2.5.  Visit 5: Day 30 (+/-3 days) 
At the EOT visit, participants will undergo safety lab assessments, a physical examination 
including a clinical assessment of gonorrhoea, and females of child-bearing potential will 
perform a urine pregnancy test. Sexual history si nce the previous visit will also be assessed. 
The medical staff will enquire with the particip ant whether they experienced any potential AE 
and took any medication since the last visit. 
Swabs will be collected for mi crobiology outcomes as per Table 4  in Section 7.4. 
 
5.2.6.  Early withdrawal 
In case a participant is withdrawn or withdraw s consent prior to Visit 5 (EOT), they will be 
asked to return to the clinic to undergo safe ty lab assessments, a physical examination and a 
urine pregnancy test if they are a female of ch ild-bearing potential, as well as the sexual 
history questionnaire, should they agree.  The me dical staff will enquire with the participant 
whether they experienced any potential AE and took any medication since the last visit. 
If a participant withdraws during the timeframe for Visit 4 or Visit 5, trial staff should attempt 
to collect samples as per the schedule of assessm ent at that visit, should the participant agree. 

 5.3. Unscheduled and out-of-window visits 
5.3.1.  Out-of-window visits 
Protocol-specified visits that occur outside of the protocol-specified time windows will be 
considered out-of-window visits. Results of a ssessments and procedures for these should be 
documented in the eCRF pages for the intended visit and a protocol deviation must be documented. In case of doubt or question on which visit should be performed, the Investigator should contact the medical monitor.  
5.3.2.  Unscheduled visits 
Unscheduled visits can occur at any time durin g study participation.  Assessments are not 
mandated per protocol but if a participant has completed scheduled visits as per protocol 
and returns to the clinic on an additional occu rrence on a day that does not correspond to a 
scheduled trial visit, site staff should handle them as per their routine practice. No assessments are mandated as per protocol, bu t can be performed and recorded for safety 
reasons as relevant to the study (e.g. follow-up safety laboratory tests). Site staff will take 
the opportunity to question the participant ab out any potential adverse event or medication 
taken. In case of identification of either, this must be recorded in source notes and 
transcribed into the eCRF into the adv erse event and concomitant medication forms 
respectively.   
6. Investigational products 
6.1. Zoliflodacin treatment  
6.1.1.  Product description and dosage 
Zoliflodacin is a first-in-class drug (spiropyrimidinetrione) with a specific mode of action 
against bacterial topoisomerase II distinct from  the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics. The 
chemical name for zoliflodacin is (2R,4S,4aS)- 11-fluoro-2,4-dimethyl-8-[(4S)-4-methyl-2-oxo-
1,3-oxazolidin-3-yl]-1,2,4,4a-tetrahydro-2'H,6 H-spiro[1,4-oxazino[4,3-a][1,2]oxazolo[4,5-g] 
quinoline-5,5'-pyrimidine]-2',4',6'(1'H,3'H)-trione. Zoliflodacin is presented as white granules for oral suspension, packaged in a single sachet. Each sachet contains 3 g amorphous zoliflodacin, co-formulated with mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, xanthan gum, talc, and magnesium stearate. Zoliflodacin is active 
against several STI pathogens, including NG, CT and Mycoplasma genitalium (33, 52).  It shows 
excellent in vitro  activity against all clinical NG isolates  tested so far, including isolates that 
were resistant to fluoroquinolones, azithromycin , and ESC, and several reference strains such 
as the XDR H401 strain (28, 32, 53).  
6.1.2.  Summary of non-clinical and clinical experience 
Please refer to the zoliflodacin IB for full descriptions of the zoliflodacin properties, non-
clinical and clinical data availa ble to date and identified and potential risks associated with 
zoliflodacin.

 6.2. Comparator trial treatment 
6.2.1.  Product description and dosage 
Ceftriaxone is a sterile, semi-synthetic, br oad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. The 
chemical name of ceftriaxone sodium is (6R, 7R)-7-[2-(2-Amino-4-thiazolyl) glyoxylamido]-8-
oxo-3-[[(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-5,6-di oxo-as-triazin-3-yl)thio]methyl]-5-thia-1 
azabicyclo [4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic ac id, 72-(Z)-(O-methyloxime), disodium salt, 
sesquaterhydrate. The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through binding to  penicillin binding proteins. Ceftriaxone is a 
white to yellowish sterile powder in a clear glass vi al. For the purpose of this trial, a single dose 
of ceftriaxone 500 mg, dissolved in lidocaine hydrochloride (HCl) 1% will be used for IM 
injection. Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic that w ill be used to numb the area of injection and 
therefore limit injection pain.  
Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial, for oral administration. The chemical name of 
azithromycin monohydrate is (2R,3S,4R,5R,8 R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R) -13-[(2,6-dideoxy-3-C-
methyl-3-O-methyl- α-L-ribohexopyranosyl) oxy]-2-ethyl- 3,4,10-trihydroxy-3,5,6,8,10,12,14-
heptamethyl-11-[[3,4,6- trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)- β-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-
azacyclopentadecan-15-one monohydrate. Azithrom ycin acts by binding to the 23S ribosomal 
ribonucleic acid (rRNA) of the 50S ribosomal su bunit of susceptible micr oorganisms inhibiting 
bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit. Azithromycin will be supplied as oral ta blets containing 250 mg azithromycin.  
6.2.1.  Summary of non-clinical and clinical experience 
Please refer to the ceftriaxone and azithromycin  summaries of product characteristics (SmPC) 
or United States Prescribing Information (USPI) , as applicable, for full descriptions of the 
identified and potential risks associat ed with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. 
6.3. Labelling and packaging 
The labelling and secondary packaging of zoliflod acin sachets and comparators treatments will 
be performed by Packaging Coordinators Inc. (PCI ) Pharma Services on behalf of the sponsor. 
All trial treatments, including those used in the comparator group, will be labelled in 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
6.4. Shipment  
All necessary documentation, including favourab le opinion from independent review boards 
(IRB) /independent ethics committees (IEC) and national regulatory authorities (NRAs), and 
import authorizations, will be obtained prior to shipment of trial treatments to trial sites. 
Upon receipt, trial treatments and their packag ing shall be inspected by the pharmacist or 
designee in charge at the trial site. All suspected defects or deterioration are to be reported to the sponsor as per the procedure outlined in the MOP. Suspected defective products are 
to be placed in a secure quarantine area pendi ng investigation and further advice from the 
sponsor. 
In the event of a batch recall, the sponsor will be responsible for informing all principal 
investigators and, in collaboration with trial site pharmacists, of facilitating collection of 
recalled batches and delivery of alternative batc hes to trial sites. All movements will be 
documented in the drug accountability forms (see Section 6.7).  

 6.5. Storage 
All trial treatments will be stored in the trial site pharmacy, separated and secured, accessible 
only to the trial site staff. All drugs should be  stored in accordance with the pharmacy manual.  
The trial site pharmacist or designee will be  responsible for monitoring and recording the 
storage temperature and ensuring appropriate measures are in place to protect the trial 
treatments from damage and/or destruction.  
6.6. Preparation and administration of trial treatments 
Trial treatments will only be dispensed and administered to individuals enrolled in the trial 
and who have been randomised. Participants rand omized to the zoliflodacin group will receive 
a single 3 g per os (PO) dose (one sachet) of zoliflodacin reconstituted with water. Detailed 
information on the preparation and administration of zoliflodacin can be found in the 
pharmacy manual. Participants randomized to th e comparator group will receive ceftriaxone 
as a 500 mg IM injection and azithromycin as fo ur 250 mg oral tablets. The 500 mg ceftriaxone 
vial will be reconstituted with lidocaine HCl 1%. Detailed information on the preparation and administration of ceftriaxone can be found in the pharmacy manual.  
6.7. Accountability 
The principal investigator at each site is responsible for the distribution and disposition of the 
trial treatments and has ultimate responsibility for accountability of trial treatments. He/she may delegate this responsibility to a trial site  pharmacist or nurse. Adequate records on 
receipt, use, return, loss, or other disposition of trial treatments must be maintained. Administration of trial treatments will be di rectly observed and documented in appropriate 
forms by the responsible trial staff. The investigat or or site staff are not authorised to supply 
trial treatment to other investigators or sites, or  allow trial treatments to be used other than 
as instructed by this protocol without prior wr itten authorisation of GARDP. At the end of the 
trial, unused drugs will be either be destro yed or returned as per sponsor instruction. 
6.8. Blinding and procedures for un-blinding 
As this is an open-label trial, procedures for un -blinding by the investigator in case of medical 
emergency are not applicable. 
6.9. Concomitant treatments 
Medications taken before or after dosing thro ugh EOT visit or early termination whichever 
occurs first will be reported as prior medicati ons or concomitant medications, respectively. 
Prior medication taken over the 30 days prior to  screening will be recorded as part of the 
screening process (Visit 1). This will also incl ude over-the-counter drugs as well as vitamins, 
herbals and supplements. 
Zoliflodacin should not be co-administered with strong (such as carbamazepine, 
enzalutamine, mitotane, phenytoin, rifampin, or  St. John's wort) or moderate (such as 
efavirenz, bosentan, etravirine, modafinil, or nafcillin) inducers of CYP3A4. These drugs should not be taken for 30 days before dosing  and during the whole trial period.  
Zoliflodacin should not be co-administered with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4. See 
MOP for examples of such inhibitors. These dr ugs should not be taken for 30 days before 
dosing and during the whole trial period.

 local standard of care, or if a participant need s post exposure prophylaxis with a prohibited 
ART, the medical monitor should be contacted im mediately to discuss each instance on a case-
by-case basis. Depending on the timing of the required administration of the ART, its 
administration may either be approved, or the participant may be withdrawn from the trial.  
In addition, medications that might interfere with  the evaluation of the investigational product 
(e.g. antibiotics with activity against NG) should not be used until the TOC visit. Any circumstances that require urgent use of an an tibiotic with activity against NG should be 
discussed with the medical monitor.  
Following dosing, any drug ( e.g., non-prescription medications, herbal supplements, vitamins, 
or prescription medications) or vaccine or blood/blood products used by the participant 
during the trial will be recorded in the partic ipant’s source documents and on the appropriate 
eCRF.  
Any antacids if taken must be administered more than 1 hour before administration of 
azithromycin. 
Participants who receive trial treatment and ar e subsequently diagnosed with a concomitant 
infection requiring systemic antibiotics ( e.g. bacterial vaginosis [BV]) or infections due to  CT, 
Mycoplasma genitalium  or Trichomonas vaginalis ) will receive treatment according to the 
local clinic’s standard protocols. Whenever po ssible, additional treatment with antibiotics 
with activity against NG should be deferred up until the TOC visit.  
6.10. Escape treatments 
Participants with persisting sign s and symptoms or with a positi ve NG culture at the TOC visit 
will be treated in accordance with national or local guidelines for treatment failures. 
Treatment received will be recorded in the eCRF. 
7. Trial procedures/evaluations 
Detailed instructions on procedures as well as collection, processing and shipment of samples 
may be found in the laboratory manual and the MOP.  
7.1. Clinical evaluations  
x Complete medical history will be obtained by interview of the participants at Visit 1 and 
will be updated at each clinic visit. Partic ipants will be queried regarding a history of 
significant medical disorders of the head, eyes , ears, nose, throat, mouth, cardiovascular 
system, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver,  pancreas, kidney, urologic system, nervous 
system, blood, lymph nodes, endocrine sy stem, musculoskeletal system, skin, and 
genital/reproductive tract. A history of any allergies, cancer, immunodeficiency, 
psychiatric illness, substance abuse, and auto immune disease will be solicited. At follow-
up visits, an interim medical history will be obtained by interview of the participants 
noting any changes since the previous visit.  
x Sexual history over the past 3 months includ ing sexual orientation will be obtained by 
interview of the participants at Visit 1.  Part icipants will be queried at Visit 3, Visit 4 and 
Visit 5 regarding sexual activity and condo m use since the previous clinic visit. 
Questionnaires to assess sexual  behaviour will be provided. 
x A targeted physical examination including height and weight and examination of the 
pharynx and genitals (including pelvic exam for women) will be performed on Visit 1, Visit 

 4 and Visit 5. In particular, presence of signs and symptoms of gonorrhoea ( e.g. UD, 
dysuria, dyspareunia, visible discharge from urethra and/or anus) will be assessed as per 
the MOP. All physical examinations will be perf ormed by a trial clinician licensed to make 
medical diagnoses. The physical examination pe rformed at screening will act as a baseline 
for subsequent visits . 
x A phone interview will be conducted at Visit 3 to check for any changes in health and any 
new medication taken. Participants will also be  asked about their sexual activity since the 
previous visit and be reminded about the ma ndatory sexual behaviour recommendations 
during their involvement in the trial. 
x Any changes in health or concomitant medicati ons taken during the trial will be enquired 
and recorded. 
7.2. Laboratory evaluations 
7.2.1.  Clinical laboratory evaluations 
x A urine pregnancy test will be performed at Visi t 1, Visit 4, Visit 5 and early withdrawal on 
all female participants of child-bearing potential. 
x HIV testing will be performed at Visit 1 accordin g to standard local practise. HIV testing is 
mandatory only for participants to the PK sub- study. For all other participants, HIV testing 
is proposed, but not mandatory. Participants with a documented positive HIV diagnosis or documented prescription for ARTs are cons idered to be HIV positive and therefore do 
not need to undergo a test. A maximum of 5 ml of venous blood might be collected for 
this test depending on local practice. Any disc ordant results should be followed up as per 
standard local practice. Further details may be found in the MOP. 
x Venous blood samples (a maximum of 15 mL) for haematology and chemistry will be 
collected at Visit 1, Visit 4 and Visit 5. FBC, ALT, direct and total bilirubin (direct bilirubin 
only required if total bilirubin is elevated), and creatinine will be measured. eGFR will be 
calculated using the chronic kidney disease - epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. A total volume of a maximum of 50 ml will be taken from each participant during 
the course of the trial (with the exclusion of the PK sub-study). 
7.2.2.  Microbiological evaluations 
x Microbiological evaluations (Gram stain, cultur e and NAAT) will be based on the collection 
of appropriate clinical specimen ( i.e. a urethral swab for male participants or an 
endocervical swab for female participants for urogenital sw abs, a pharyngeal swab or a 
rectal swab) and in accordance with the laboratory manual and MOP. Specimens are 
collected by trained study staff, except pha ryngeal specimens which can be self-collected, 
where permitted and as detailed in the MOP. A specific swab for NG culture will be taken 
followed by bedside inoculation of NG selective agar plates. 
x Assessment of efficacy in the present trial follows recommendations from the US FDA 
(38). All cultures will be performed in certified  national or state/provincial or local  
reference laboratories (see the laboratory manu al for a complete list). Local laboratories 
will perform presumptive NG identification, whil e confirmatory NG identification will be 
carried out by the central laboratory also a ssessing antimicrobial susceptibility testing. 
x Detection of nucleic acid will be based on colle ction of swabs as above and use of  NAAT. 

 A single swab using the applicable manufact urer’s recommended collection kits will be 
taken to assess the presence of NG and/or CT from the same clinical specimen to minimise 
patient discomfort. Acceptable NAAT platfo rms/systems and assays are listed in the 
laboratory manual. Detailed methods for N AAT performance can be found in the trial 
laboratory manual. 
x Presumed positive cultures will be processed a nd frozen bacterial isolates will be sent to 
the central laboratory for confirmatory iden tification and antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing. Aliquots of these frozen bacterial isol ates will be stored at a local laboratory for 
future research up to 5 years after the end of  the trial, should participants agree (with the 
exception of the Netherlands where bacterial is olates will be kept up to 15 years as per 
standard local practice). 
x The MIC, defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibited the visible 
growth of a microorganism after overnigh t incubation, will be determined for the 
following antibiotics: zoliflodacin, azithrom ycin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, 
gentamicin, tetracycline  and spectinomycin. Detailed methods for MIC determination can 
be found in the trial laboratory manual. Confir matory identification of NG by the central 
lab will constitute data for the primary outcome of the trial. 
x WGS will be conducted on all NG isolates cult ured at the TOC and EOT visits, as well as on 
pre-treatment isolates from the respective pa rticipants and on baseline isolates with 
zoliflodacin MIC >0.25 μg/mL. The main objective is to investigate  relationships between 
pre-treatment and post-treatment NG  isolates within those participants whose cultures 
at TOC are found positive for NG, eval uate the likelihood of re-infection vs treatment 
failure and identify possible genetic dete rminants of zoliflodacin resistance.  The analyses 
will be performed at the microbiology laboratory of the University of Örebro in Sweden.  
7.3. Pharmacokinetic evaluations 
The PK sub-study will be run at select sites (see MOP for list).  
The plasma concentration of zoliflodacin will be determined in the following subsets of 
participants: 
x HIV negative participants and HIV positive participants ( ≥ 18 years old) 
x HIV negative adolescents ( ≥12 and <18 years old) 
Each group will include approximately 20 to 30  participants, with PK assessed at five time-
points: 
x 15 min – 1 h post treatment 
x 2 h – 2.5 h post treatment 
x 4.5 h – 5 h post treatment 
x 10 h - 12 h post treatment 
x 24 h - 36 h post treatment 
The time periods will cover C max and at least a 10-fold decline in plasma concentration from 
this, this decline being adequately defined as  mono-exponential. Sampling time post dose 
will be accurately recorded in the eCRF. Plas ma concentrations of zoliflodacin will be 
determined by K-CAS labo ratories using a validated high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) – mass spectroscopy (MS)/MS method. 

 At each time point, a 4 ml venous blood samp le will be collected. Samples will be centrifuged 
to allow for extraction of plasma. Plasma shou ld be frozen at about – 70 °C within a 
maximum of 60 minutes after collection of the bl ood samples. Further details are available in 
the MOP.  
The same food intake recommendations detailed in Section 5.2.1  apply to the participants to 
the PK sub-study. 
7.4. Clinical management of participants 
Assessments performed at site level will be us ed for patient management. This includes HIV 
and pregnancy testing. Safety laboratory results will be communicated to sites in a timely manner to ensure appropriate management of any laboratory finding that is out-of-normal 
range (see laboratory manual for details).

Antimicrobial susceptibility te sting will be performed in batches during the trial and 
therefore will not be available to sites for clin ical management. WGS is exploratory in nature 
and will moreover be analysed in batches. As a consequence, results are not to be used for 
clinical management. 
8. Assessment of safety  
8.1. Definitions 
8.1.1.  Adverse event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurre nce in a clinical trial participant administered 
a medicinal product and which does not necessar ily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding or a procedure abnormality th at are deemed clinically significant by the 
investigator), symptom, or disease temporally as sociated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Furthermore, the definition of an AE includes  worsening (in severity and frequency) of pre-
existing conditions ("medical history") after tr ial drug administration and abnormalities of 
procedures (i.e. electrocardiogram, X-ray…) or laboratory results which are assessed as 
“clinically significant”. 
What laboratory/procedures abnormalities should be considered as an AE? All treatment-emergent laboratory/procedures abnormalities (or worsening in severity or 
frequency of pre-existing abnormalities) assessed as “clinically significant” must be reported 
as an AE. 
When reporting an abnormal laboratory/proce dure result, a clinical diagnosis should be 
recorded rather than the abnormal value itself , if available (for example, “anaemia” rather 
than “decreased red blood cell count”).  
What is not an AE? 
• Medical conditions or abnormal safety labo ratory results present at the initial trial 
visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency during the trial are NOT considered 
as AE and should be documented as medical history if significant. 
x Symptoms, exacerbation or worsening of th e studied disease will NOT be considered 
as AE and will not be captured in the AE page of the eCRF if consistent with the 
anticipated natural progression of the diseas e (overall and for this given participant). 
• Lack of efficacy of the trial treatment is NOT considered as AE. 
Special Cases: screening period: With the exception of abnormal safety labora tory findings detected at baseline (which are 
assumed to have been present prior to inform ed consent), events occurring after informed 
consent but prior to study treatment administrati on must be reported as adverse events using 
the applicable form in the eCRF, but will not be classified as treatment-emergent adverse 
events.  

Confidential  Page 49 of 74 
 8.1.2.  Adverse Event reporting period 
The adverse events reporting period begins up on participant enrolment in the trial (after 
signature of informed consent) and ends at an EOT or early withdrawal visit.  
All adverse events that occur during the adverse event reporting period specified in the 
protocol must be reported, whether the event is  considered medication related or not. In 
addition, any adverse event that occurs after the adverse event reporting period that the 
investigator assesses as possibly related to th e investigational medication should also be 
reported as an adverse event. 
Special Cases: screening failures:  
For screening failure participants , events and updates must be recorded in the eCRF and using 
the AE or serious adverse event (SAE) forms (as appropriate) until the date the participant was 
determined to be a screening failure. Beyond th at date, only serious or medically relevant 
protocol-related events will be followed-up. The date and time of screening failure will also 
be recorded in the source notes and the eCRF. 
8.1.3.  Serious adverse event 
An AE is defined as serious if it:  
x results in death 
x is life-threatening: in this context refers to an AE in which the participant was at risk of 
death at the time of the AE; it does not refer to an AE that hypothetically might have 
caused death if more severe 
x requires or prolongs hospitalization, i.e. the AE requires at least an overnight admission 
or prolongs a hospitalisation beyond the expected length of stay. Hospital admissions 
for social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the 
participant’s general condition, as well as hospitalisation for elective surgery or for 
normal disease management (including treatment adjustment) are NOT to be 
considered as SAE according to this criterion  
x results in persistent or significant disabilit y, i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial 
disruption of the participant’s abili ty to conduct normal activities 
x is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, i.e. an AE outcome in a child or foetus of a 
participant exposed to the IMP before conception or during pregnancy 
x is an important medical event.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious events, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but might jeopardise the 
participant or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include, but are not li mited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; bloo d dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in hospitalization. In addition, any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse event/reaction.  
Although exposure during preg nancy and overdose are not always serious by regulatory 
definition, these events must be  handled as defined in Section 8.4 for reporting trial treatment 
exposure during pregnancies and Section 8.1.4  for overdose. 

 8.1.4.  Overdose 
An overdose is defined as a dose greater than  the dose evaluated in the present trial as 
described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the protocol.  
All overdoses should be reported in the eCRF. If  the overdose is associated with an AE, then 
the AE should also be reported.  
In the event of an overdose of trial treatment, the investigator should use clinical judgment in 
treating the overdose and contact the sponsor me dical monitor. The investigator should refer 
to the IB for detailed information regarding warn ings, precautions, contraindications, AEs, and 
other significant data pertaining to zoliflodacin . Investigators should re fer to ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin SmPCs respectively in case of overdose with either comparator treatment. 
Trial treatment dosing errors made by the rese arch facility staff that result in a possible 
overdose (as well as all dosing errors) of trial treatment must be documented as protocol 
deviations and reported to the sponsor and the IRB/IEC in accordan ce with the IRB/IEC 
requirements.  
8.1.5.  Grading of AE severity 
The severity is used to describe the medical intens ity of a specific event. In this clinical trial, 
the severity of AEs must be primarily assesse d by investigators according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (54) tables as a guide in the grading of the 
severity of AEs (grades 1-5). The tabl es will be provided in the MOP.  
Whenever the AE grading is not detailed in the CTCAE tables, the investigator should use the 
following grading for that specific AE: 
MILD : The participant is aware of the event or sy mptom, but the event or symptom is easily 
tolerated. Does not interfere with the trial pa rticipant’s activities of daily living (ADL). 
MODERATE : The participant experiences sufficient disc omfort to interfere with or reduce his 
or her usual level of ADL. 
SEVERE: Significant impairment of functioning: the participant is unable to carry out usual ADL 
and/or the participant’s life is at risk from the event.  
LIFE-THREATENING : The participant’s life is at significant risk; extreme limitation in ADL, 
significant assistance required; significan t medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospitalization or hospice care probable. 
The investigator should continue using the abov e grading for all other subsequent evaluations 
of this particular AE for that participant and all others. When the intensity of an AE changes 
over time, each change in intensity will be re corded in the source documents until the event 
resolves. However, only one AE and the maximu m intensity will be recorded in the eCRF for 
each separate event. If the AE resolves but th en recurs, each will be recorded as a separate 
AE, with the appropriate start and stop dates and times.  
8.1.6.  AE causality assessment 
For both serious and non-serious AEs, the investigator is required to assess if there is a causal 
relationship between the AE and the trial treatments, ie. to determine whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the trial trea tments caused or contributed to the AE. 

 The following categories for relationship to each trial treatment will be used during AE 
reporting: 
RELATED : There is at least a reasonable possibility of causal relationship between the AE and 
the trial treatment. This means that there ar e facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship. 
NOT RELATED : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the trial treatment.  
8.2. Detection and recording of AEs 
The investigator is required to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse 
events spontaneously reported by the trial part icipant using concise me dical terminology. In 
addition, at each visit the participant will be  questioned about the occurrence of adverse 
events, with a generic question such as “ Since last visit have you felt any health problem? ”. 
AEs can be spontaneously reported by trial pa rticipants or elicited through open-ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of trial participants during trial visits. The investigator 
should also review all results of assessments perf ormed as part of the trial, such as laboratory 
assessment results and physical examinations, an d assess them for clinically relevant changes 
compared to baseline (Section 8.1.1 ). 
All AEs occurring during the trial must be recorded  in the AE section of the eCRF. AE recording 
applies to both investigational and control group. AEs (including lab or procedures abnormalities) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than 
individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE.  
As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine: 
x
x The severity grade based on the CTCAE (54) Grade 1-5 (Section 8.1.5 ) or on grading scale 
described above (only for those AEs not described in CTCAE) 
x Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at the end-of-trial visit) 
x Its relationship to each trial treatment (causality; see Section 8.1.6 ) 
x Action taken with respect to each trial treatment (treatment maintained, dose reduced, 
permanently discontinued, temporarily discontinued, not applicable) 
x Whether medication or therapy was taken/given in relation to the AE 
x Whether it is serious (see Section 8.1.3 ). 
AE recording shall begin upon signature of the informed consent form (ICF) and should 
continue until the participant’s last visit. 
8.3. Expedited reporting of SAEs 
8.3.1.  Reporting of SAEs to sponsor 
Every SAE occurring in a trial participant dur ing the trial (whether or not the event is 
considered trial treatment related) must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor on SAE e-mail address (mentioned below) within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence, preferably using an SAE report form in Eng lish (dated, signed and scanned). All relevant 
information concerning the SAE must be obtaine d from the appropriate points of contact, 
such as description of the event, onset date a nd type, duration, severity, relationship to each 
trial treatment, outcome, actions taken, emer gency room records, laboratory testing and 

 treatment of the SAE, and all other relevant clin ical and laboratory data  as soon as possible. 
SAE email address: SAESTI_Zoli001@gardp.org 
The original copy of the SAE report form and the confirmation of receipt email must be kept 
with the participant medical file at the trial site. 
Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression  of the initial SAE must be reported as 
follow-up to the original episode within 24 ho urs of the investigator receiving the follow-up 
information.  
Alike non-serious AEs, information about all SAEs should also be collected and recorded in the 
AE section of the eCRF.  
8.3.2.  Reporting of SAEs to national regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
Related SAEs and SUSARs will be reported in an  expedited manner to the national regulatory 
authorities (NRA), ethics committees and any ot her relevant institutions/bodies as per local 
safety reporting regulations. Further details will be provided in the trial safety management plan. 
8.4. Exposure during pregnancies 
The effect of zoliflodacin administration has not been studied in pregnant women. Therefore, 
all eligible women of reproductive age must no t be pregnant and have a negative pregnancy 
test before they can be included in the trial. All female participants must also agree on using  
a highly effective method of contraception at the time of IMP administration on Day 1 (see 
Appendix 1 for acceptable methods and required duration) and until at least 28 days after 
administration of the trial treatment.  
All participants must be instructed to inform  the investigator immediately if there is a 
suspicion of pregnancy. If followi ng trial treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a trial 
participant, or the female partne r of a trial participant, is pregnant or may have been pregnant 
at the time of investigational drug exposure, th e sponsor must be notified immediately (within 
24 hours). The principal investigator must repo rt all cases of exposure to study treatment 
during pregnancies using the “pregnancy surveillan ce form”. This must be done irrespective 
of whether an adverse event has occurred. Th e information submitted should include the 
anticipated date of delivery. 
The investigator must follow the women exposed during pregnancy from day of awareness of 
pregnancy until completion of the pregnancy at definite intervals (at 3 months, 6 months, at 
9 month/child birth) or until pregnancy termin ation (i.e., induced / spontaneous abortion). 
The investigator will provide pregnancy outcome information as a follow up to the initial 
pregnancy surveillance form.  
Stillbirth infants should be seen by a doctor as  soon as possible to assess the cause of death. 
In the case of a live birth, a doctor (preferably a paediatrician if possible) should assess the infant at the time of birth and submit a child surveillance report to the sponsor. 
Follow-up of children exposed to drug in utero is proposed to the parents by the Investigator, 
until the children reach 2 years of age. If an event presented by a child exposed to drug in 
utero during child monitoring is identified as meeting a seriousness criterion (e.g. congenital anomaly or death), it shall be reported usin g the SAE form (in addition to the “Child 
Surveillance form”) within the same timelines as for SAE reporting (see timelines in Section 

 8.1.2 ).  
8.5. AE follow up 
All AEs should be treated appropriately by the investigator. Once an AE is detected, it should 
be followed until its resolution or until stabilizat ion. Assessment should be made at each visit 
(or more frequently, if necessary) of any change s in severity, suspected relationship to the 
trial regimen, interventions required to treat it, and outcome. For AEs that have not resolved at the end of the trial, it is the responsibilit y of the principal investigator to ensure that 
participants are appropriately referred to their tr eating physician or to an adequate specialist. 
In addition, all serious adverse events an d those non-serious events assessed by the 
investigator as related to the investigational dr ug must continue to be followed even after the 
subject participation in the trial is over. Such events should be followed until they resolve or 
until the investigator assesses them as “chronic” or “stable”. 
8.6.  Safety assessments 
Safety assessments include physical examination, safety lab assessment and review of 
potential AEs. They will be performed at each vi sit, as per the schedule of events (Section 5).  
 9. Withdrawals 
At any point in time, participants may withdraw  consent. Participants who withdraw from the 
trial will benefit from the same conditions of ca re as those who remain in the trial. Samples 
collected up until the date of withdrawal will be  kept and analyzed, and this will be explained 
in the ICF. 
The investigator is responsible for completing a final assessment form in the eCRF at the time 
of the participant’s withdrawal. The investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for consent withdrawal, while fu lly respecting the participant's rights.  
If a participant does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact 
him/her. In any circumstance, every effort (a  minimum of 2 phone calls, documented in the 
source documents) should be made to do cument participant outcome, if possible. 
The investigator may also decide to withdraw a participant from the trial at any time without 
penalty and for any reason without  prejudice to his or her future medical care. Participants 
may be withdrawn for non-compliance with trial procedures or trial drug administration.  
In all cases, the date and reason(s) for withdr awal (including the primary reason) must be 
recorded in the source documents and the eCRF . If a participant is prematurely withdrawn 
from the trial for any reason, the investigat or must make every effort to perform the 
evaluations in accordance with Section 5.2.6 . Every effort will be made to follow up 
participants who prematurely discontinue fr om the trial to determine final outcome. 
10. Data collection and management 
10.1. Source data 
According to the International Council on Ha rmonization of Technical Requirements for 
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), source documents are “original 
documents, data and records ( e.g. hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, participant’s diaries or checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data 

 from automated instruments, microfiches, pho tographic negatives, microfilms or magnetic 
media, X-rays, participant files, and records ke pt at the pharmacy at the laboratory and at 
medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial)” (ICH E6, 1.52) 
According to the ICH, source data are “all info rmation in original records and certified copies 
of original records of clinical findings, observ ations, or other activities in a clinical trial 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of  the trial. Source data are contained in 
source documents (original records or certified copies)” (ICH E6, 1.51). 
In the present trial, all trial data will be fi rst recorded in source documents before being 
transcribed in the eCRF or data provided to PV.  
The source documents must remain available at th e trial site after data have been transcribed 
in the eCRF/data or forms sent to PV, to allow re trospective checks that source data have been 
accurately and completely transcribed in the eC RF/data sent to PV. The investigator will allow 
the monitors, the persons responsible for the audit, the representatives of the ethics 
committees, and of the regulatory authoritie s to have direct access to source data and 
documents in order to analyse, examine, verify  and reproduce any report and record that is 
important for the evaluation of the trial. 
10.2. Electronic data capture system 
An eCRF will be designed to record all the data  to be collected as per the protocol. An eCRF 
will be completed for each participant. The eCRF, together with all trial related forms and logs 
will be produced by the sponsor before being distributed to investigators. The eCRFs have 
been built using Clinical Studio, a fully valida ted secure web-enabled software that conforms 
to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements.  
The designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the eCRF. 
The principal investigator will be responsible for assuring that the data entered into the eCRF 
is complete, accurate, consistent with the so urce documents and that entry and updates are 
performed in a timely manner (including in cons istency with data sent to PV). Corrections and 
alterations of data on the eCRF or source documents must be made by the investigator or by the designated person from his/her team and must  be dated and signed. Investigator site staff 
will not be given access to the electronic data  capture (EDC) system until they have been 
adequately trained.  
Medical history/current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the 
MedDRA terminology. Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using WHO-DRUG dictionary. 
ICON GPHS data management will review the eC RF data entered by investigator staff for 
completeness and accuracy. Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and 
requesting clarification will be created for disc repancies and missing values and sent to the 
investigational site via the EDC system. Designat ed investigator site staff are required to 
respond promptly to querie s and to make any necessary changes to the data. 
Protocol deviations will be detected thro ugh appropriate monitoring (see Section 13 quality 
assurance and quality control). These shou ld be appropriately documented and upon 
conclusion of the trial, the list of deviations  will be communicated to ICON GPHS data 
management and statistics. Once the trial da ta has been verified for completeness and 
accuracy, the database will be locked.  

 11. Data analysis and statistical methods 
11.1. Sample size determination 
The efficacy of the combination therapy 500 mg IM ceftriaxone and 1 g oral azithromycin in 
the SOLITAIRE-U trial was initially used as the cure rate reference (55, 56). This trial had assessed the non-inferiority of a single dose of 1 g oral solithromycin in comparison with the 
combination therapy in uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhoea; it reported 84.5% (95% CI, 72.4 
to 87.1%) microbiological cure rate under the combination therapy (56). In addition, the trial 
observed 14% of participants with indeterminate outcome (participants who did not return for TOC assessment).  
For this study, the initial assumption was that there would be no treatment difference 
between the parenteral comparator ceftriaxon e and azithromycin) and zoliflodacin. A 10% 
non-inferiority margin was initially selected, based on the US FDA guidelines on drug 
development for NG (38). An unequal allocation ratio was chosen to provide sufficient data 
on the safety of zoliflodacin (57). The initial hypothesis was that a single oral 3 g of zoliflodacin would be non-inferior to a combination of a sing le IM 500 mg dose of ceftriaxone and a single 
1 g oral dose of azithromycin if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the microbiological cure rate of the combination therapy minus zo liflodacin was 10% or less (prespecified non-
inferiority margin for the primary endpoint). Ba sed on an 85% cure rate in the comparator 
arm (combination therapy), and a non-inferiority margin of 10%, it was calculated that 603 
participants (402 in the intervention group an d 201 in the control group, with a two-sided α 
of 5% and 2:1 allocation ratio) would provide 90%  power to show that a single oral 3 g dose 
of zoliflodacin was non-inferior to a combination of a single IM 500 mg dose of ceftriaxone and a single 1 g oral dose of azithromycin with  respect to microbiological cure rate at TOC. 
Taking into account criteria for inclusio n in the micro-ITT population (see Section 11.2.1) , it 
was estimated that a maximum of 35% of the randomized population would be potentially 
ineligible for inclusion in the micro-ITT population. Therefore, it was anticipated that up to 
approximately 928 participants would be randomi zed into the trial in order to achieve the 
target sample size of 603 in the micro-ITT population. Accounting for anticipated screening failures, the enrolment sample size was estimated to be around 1092. 
During the study however, GARDP reassessed the cu re rates of all recent Phase 2 and 3 trials 
investigating the efficacy of a new oral inve stigational product for uncomplicated gonorrhoea 
(24, 26, 56, 58). This indicated that when  comparing an oral therapy (even with 100% 
susceptibility) against a parenteral combination that rarely fails, a true underlying treatment 
difference of at least -4% should be assumed, rather than the assumption of equal underlying 
cure rates used in the initial sample size calculat ion. This is hypothesized to be due to intrinsic 
differences in the bioavailability of an oral v ersus parenteral drug. Under these assumptions, 
the oral therapy would still be estimated to yi eld a true cure rate of over 95% which is 
acceptable for single dose oral therapy for gonorr hoea as stated in the CDC criteria (59, 60). 
In addition, Mitrani-Gold et al. published in 2022 a systematic litera ture review and meta-
analysis (using a weighted, non-iterative random-effects model) to estimate the microbiological response rate and 95% CIs fo r ceftriaxone and proxy-for-placebo (61). The 
analysis proposed that by reviewing data from more recent studies, a non-inferiority margin of 15% was shown to robustly preserve estimated ceftriaxone treatment effect in a Phase 3 
microbiologically evaluable population. Usin g the same methodology, GARDP conducted a 
conservative analysis in a microbiologically evaluable population comparing ceftriaxone 

 treatment effect in the micro-ITT population with the proxy-for-placebo estimate, which 
showed a margin of 12% would preserve 57% of the estimated ceftriaxone treatment effect.  
Therefore in a Type C interaction with the US FDA held in October 2022 wherein GARDP 
requested consideration by the Agen cy of an increase in the non-inferiority margin, taking into 
account the -4% treatment difference, the published meta-analysis (61) and the unmet public health need for new drugs active agains t ceftriaxone-resistant NG (see Section 1.3), the US 
FDA indicated that a wider non-inferiority marg in of 12% for the primary endpoint could be 
acceptable. In the Appendix ‘Justification for no ninferiority margin’, the US FDA guidance (38) 
estimates the benefit of an effective treatment over placebo to be 11.9%, but this is acknowledged by the US FDA to be a conservative estimate due to the limitation of the data 
included in the meta-analysis. Additiona lly, the Agency added that, dependent on 
demonstrated efficacy, consideration would be given for a broad or limited population 
indication for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea. 
Consequently, it will be considered that a single oral 3 g of zoliflodacin will be non-inferior to 
a combination of a single IM 500 mg dose of ceftriaxone and a single 1 g oral dose of 
azithromycin if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95 % CI for the microbiological cure rate of the 
combination therapy minus zoliflodacin would be  12% or less (prespecified non-inferiority 
margin for the primary endpoint). 
Keeping in mind the trial was conducted for the most part during the high peaks of the COVID-
19 pandemic, monitoring of blinded pooled da ta was conducted to assess the performance of 
the study against assumptions used in the sample  size determination described above in these 
higher risk circumstances. When approximat ely 70% of participants were enrolled, the 
proportion of participants ineligible for th e micro-ITT population were estimated to be 
approximately 20% (vs 35% in original assumptions), and the proportion of nonassessable 
outcomes due to missed TOC assessments at 10% (foreseen at 15% in original assumptions).  
Based on these estimations, a blinded pooled da ta analysis was performed taking into account 
as well the-4% treatment difference and a 12% non-inferiority margin. It was concluded that 
696 participants evaluable for the micro-ITT anal ysis set (464 in the intervention group and 
232 in the control group, with a two-sided α of 5% and 2:1 allocation ratio) would provide 
approximately 90% power to show that a single oral  3 g dose of zoliflodacin is non-inferior to 
a combination of a single IM 500 mg dose of ceftriaxone and a single 1 g oral dose of 
azithromycin with respect to microbiological cure rate at TOC. Taking into account criteria for 
inclusion in the micro-ITT population (see Section 11.2.1 ) and blinded analysis of study 
conduct, it is estimated conservatively that a maximum of 25% of the randomized population 
would be potentially ineligible for inclusion in the micro-ITT population. Therefore, up to 
approximately 928 participants are to be random ized into the trial in order to achieve the 
target sample size of 696 in the micro-ITT population (remains unchanged). Similarly, 
accounting for anticipated screening failures, th e enrolment sample size remains estimated to 
be around 1092. 
11.2. Definition of trial populations included in the analysis 
For each microbiological outcome an d anatomical site (see Section 2), there will be three 
analysis population types used for the efficacy analysis: the micro-ITT, the evaluable and the 
PP population. The micro-ITT will be the prim ary analysis population while the evaluable and 
PP population will be the secondary. For clinical  outcomes, the clinical cure and PP populations 
will be used.  

 11.2.1.  Micro-ITT population 
The micro-ITT population will include all rand omized participants who had a positive NG  
culture at baseline and whose baseline antimicrob ial susceptibility testing result showed no 
pre-existing resistance to both ceftriaxone and azithromycin. It will include participants who 
do not comply with trial treatment, thos e who are lost-to-follow-up, those who are 
nonassessable for microbiological outcome, or wh o receive antibacterial therapy with activity 
against NG prior to the TOC visit. A participan t’s eligibility for the micro-ITT population will 
depend on the particular anatomical site in question.  
Resistance will be defined as per local standard s. Further details may be found in the SAP. 
Participants who receive the trial trea tment and are found to have a negative  NG culture at 
the urethral or cervical site at baseline (visit 1) will be excluded from the micro-ITT population 
and thus of the primary efficacy endpoint anal ysis and secondary analyses corresponding to 
the urethral or cervical sites. Participants wh o receive trial product and are found to be NG 
culture negative at the rectal or pharyngeal si te at visit 1 will be excluded from the micro-ITT 
population for the corresponding secondary effica cy endpoint analyses at the rectal or 
pharyngeal sites. 
The modified micro-ITT population will include all randomized participants who had a positive 
NG culture at baseline. 
11.2.2.  Clinical cure population 
For the efficacy analyses of clin ical cure, the clinical cure popul ation will include all male at 
birth participants included in  the micro-ITT population and wh o had at least one sign or 
symptom of urethral gonorrhoea at baseline.  
11.2.3.  Evaluable population 
The evaluable population will include all random ized participants who have a positive NG 
culture at baseline and whose baseline antimicrob ial susceptibility test ing result showed no 
pre-existing resistance to both ceftriaxone and azithromycin, who do not vomit within 30 
mins of administration of zoliflodacin or azithromycin and who have a NG culture result at the TOC visit. 
11.2.4.  PP population 
The PP efficacy population will include all part icipants in the micro-IT T population who meet 
all inclusion/exclusion criteria, complied with tria l treatment, did not vomit within 30 mins of 
administration of zoliflodacin or azithromycin, did not receive any systemic antibiotic with 
known activity against NG prior to TOC visit, di d not receive any of the prohibited medications, 
abstained from sexual intercourse and used c ondoms for vaginal, anal and oral sex prior to 
TOC and returned to the trial si te for the TOC visit within the specified window (Visit 4, trial 
day 6±2).  
The clinical-PP population will include male partic ipants in the PP population with at least one 
sign or symptom of gonorrhoea at baseline an d with an evaluable clinical cure outcome. 
11.2.5.  Safety population 
The safety population will include all randomiz ed participants who have received trial 
treatment. 

 11.2.6.  PK population 
The PK population will include all participants randomized to the zoliflodacin group who 
consent to participate to the PK sub-study and from whom at least one valid PK sample post 
treatment is obtained. 
11.3. Baseline characteristics 
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics will be described overall and by treatment 
group and trial site. Demographic data will include age, gender, sex at birth and ethnicity. Baseline clinical data will include initial clinic al presentation, sexual history, previous or 
coexisting sexually transmitted infections, result s of laboratory investigations including results 
of culture, NAAT and Gram stain, and antibi otics susceptibility testing where available. 
Summary tables will present descriptive statistics : for continuous variables, mean ± standard 
deviation or median and range (whichever is most appropriate); for categorical variables, 
frequency counts and percentage of pa rticipants within each category.  
Any missing data pattern will be investigated  and reasons for missing data obtained and 
summarised where possible. A second table summarising baseline characteristics of participants by trial groups with no missing out come will be presented to assess whether these 
characteristics were balanced between the trea tment groups when only participants with 
non-missing outcomes are considered. 
11.4. Efficacy analysis 
11.4.1.  Definitions 
x Microbiological cure: a participant with a positive NG  culture at baseline and a negative 
NG culture at the TOC visit. A positive NG cult ure is defined as a culture with confirmed 
microbiological identification by the central laboratory. 
x Microbiological failure: a pa rticipant with a positive NG  culture at baseline and at the 
TOC visit and for whom there is no supportive evidence of a re-infection or a participant experiencing an intercurrent event before the TOC visit which is possibly related to a lack of efficacy of the study treatment. Supportive evidence of re-infection includes re-exposure to an untreated sex partner or a NG strain genotype different from the strain identified at baseline and/ or history of unprotected sex. A participant 
with a positive NG  culture at baseline and who is nonassessable for microbiological 
outcome at TOC (e.g. who has a missing micr obiological outcome at the TOC due to a 
missed visit or a lost/damaged microbiological specimen) is also considered a failure. 
x Clinical cure: a male at birth participant ex periencing resolution of signs and symptoms 
of urogenital gonococcal infection that were  present at enrolment. Further details on 
assessment of clinical cure are included in the MOP. 
x Lost-to-follow-up: a participant who has mi ssed his/her appointment after completing 
treatment and cannot be traced until and including the end of the expected follow-up 
period (30 days± 3 days) 
x Non-evaluable for microbiological outcome: a participant who did not have a 
urogenital positive culture result for NG at baseline (visit 1). 
11.4.2.  Specification of efficacy analysis 
Efficacy endpoints are defined in Section 2. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as a 
negative culture to NG at urethral or cervical sites at TOC (day 6 ±2) among patients included 

 in the micro-ITT population.  
The difference in the proportions of participants, in the micro-ITT population, with negative 
culture at the TOC visit will be estimated be tween the ceftriaxone/azithromycin and the 
zoliflodacin groups and a 2-sided 95% CI will be calculated. The primary efficacy analysis will 
claim zoliflodacin as non-inferior to the ceft riaxone/azithromycin combination if the upper 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the microbiolo gical cure rate of th e combination therapy 
minus zoliflodacin lies below the 12% prespecified  non-inferiority margin. The primary analysis 
will be conducted on the micro-ITT analysis , which includes participants who are non-
assessable for microbiological outcome or who are lost-to-follow-up.  
To include all randomized participants, missing  outcomes will be replaced using multiple 
imputation (62). Sensitivity analyses will also  be performed to explore departures from 
assumptions about missing data. To take into account the possibility that missing outcomes 
are not completely at random, a pattern mixture model will be fitted under missing at random 
(MAR) and it will be expanded to allow for the context of missing not at  random (MNAR) (62). 
Results of sensitivity analyses will be presente d graphically by an estimation of the treatment 
effect (microbiological cure rate) in the comb ination therapy group, in the zoliflodacin group 
and in both groups depending on the departures  from assumptions about missing data (62).  
This efficacy analysis will also be performed on  the PP and evaluable population as part of the 
secondary objectives.  
For secondary efficacy endpoints, Chi-2 or Fish er exact tests will be performed, depending on 
applicability criteria, for the comparison of: 
1) The proportions of microbiological cure at TOC between both trial groups at

2) The proportions of clinical cure at TOC between both trial groups.  
These analyses will be conducted in the micr o-ITT population and repeated in the modified 
micro-ITT, the evaluable and PP populations, unless stated otherwise. In particular, the proportion of clinical cure will be assessed in th e clinical cure population. All statistical tests 
will be 2-sided with a level of significance set at 5%. In addition, the following comparison will be made 
3) The proportions of participants with a negative  NG NAAT from urethral or cervical sites 
at TOC between both trial groups 
4) The proportions of participants with a negative NG NAAT from oropharyngeal sites at 
TOC between both trial groups

between both trial groups 
These analyses will be conducted among participants that have a positive NG NAAT from the 
corresponding site at baseline. 
Regarding the antimicrobial suscep tibility testing profile of gonococcal isolates, all analyses 
will be descriptive. The MIC breakpoint plus the median, 90

MIC and range of MICs will be reported  by treatment group and by site of infection. The 
proportion of isolates at or above MIC breakpoi nt (n/N) at baseline and TOC (if applicable) will 
also be reported by treatment group and by site of infection. Moreover, changes in 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing between the baseline and TOC isolates will be reported for 

 all participants with microbiological fail ure without any statistical comparison.  
A descriptive analysis of participants with ba seline isolates resistant to ceftriaxone, to 
azithromycin and to both will al so be reported. Sensitivity analyses will also be performed. 
In addition, the following exploratory, compar ative analyses will be conducted using Mann-
Whitney non-parametric test: 
x Antimicrobial susceptibility testing profil e (MIC distribution) of baseline and TOC 
isolates for participants with multiple sites of  infection vs participants with unique site 
of infection. 
x Antimicrobial susceptibility testing profil e (MIC distribution) of baseline and TOC 
isolates for isolates that are resistant to fl uoroquinolones at baseline vs isolates that 
are fluoroquinolone-sensitive. 
x Antimicrobial susceptibility testing profil e (MIC distribution) of baseline and TOC 
isolates for isolates that are resistant to  other antibiotics commonly used for NG 
treatment (e.g. azithromycin and ceftriaxone) at baseline vs isolates that are sensitive 
to those antibiotics. 
x Antimicrobial susceptibility testing profile ( MIC distribution) of baseline isolates of 
participants with subseque nt microbiological failure vs microbiological cure. 
11.5. Safety analysis 
Safety endpoints are defined in Section 2. All safety analyses will be descriptive, and endpoints 
will be reported by trial group.  
AEs will be coded using the latest version of the MedDRA. All AEs and SAEs occurring after trial 
drug dosing will be summarized using frequenc y counts and percentage s and their exact 95% 
CI in the following groups: 
x Overall ( i.e., regardless of severity or relationship to treatment); 
x By severity grade (mild, moderate, or severe); 
x By relationship to trial drug; 
x By MedDRA level hierarchy (system organ class [SOC], higher level group term [HLGT], 
and preferred term [PT]). 
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, 95% CI or median and interquartile range, 
whichever is appropriate) will be used to summa rize clinical laboratory data at baseline and 
during follow-up visits. Changes in laboratory results pre- and post-treatment will be 
examined and those that are cl inically significant will be highlighted and reported as AE. 
11.6. Pharmacological endpoints  
The following PK parameters will be estimated for zoliflodacin: 
x AUC (0-last) : Area under the concentration time-curve from time zero to the last 
concentration above the lower limit of quantitation 
x AUC (0-∞): Area under the concentration time-curve from time zero to infinity  
x AUC (0-t): Area under the concentration time-curve from time zero to time t 
x Cmax: Maximum observed concentration 
x Tmax: Time of maximum observed concentration 
x Ke: Elimination rate constant 
x t1/2: Terminal elimination half-life 

 x CL/F: Apparent total clearance of th e drug after oral administration 
x Vz/F: Apparent volume of distribution 
The PK analysis will be addressed in a separate report. 
11.7. Missing values 
Prior to analysis, any missing data will be inve stigated and reasons for missing data obtained 
and summarised where possible. All attempts will be made to avoid any missing outcome data and to correct for it. Because the definition of the micro-ITT includes participants who are non-assessable for microbiological outcome or who are lost-to-follow-up, we will replace missing outcomes using multiple imputation (as described under 11.4). The missing data will be imputed with predicted values from a multivariabl e logistic regression model that will include 
these observed participant data and that w ill be adjusted for baseline covariates ( e.g. trial 
centre, age, history of unprotected sex). The mu ltivariable model will yield a probability of a 
Bernoulli process that is used to generate values  for the outcome data. The probability will be 
used to impute the missing outcome value by roundi ng it to the nearest integer (0 or 1) or by 
sampling from a Bernoulli distribution. To avoi d any bias, the imprecision due to imputation 
will be accounted for by means of multiple im putation (M=20 imputations). Hence, multiple 
datasets with imputed outcomes will be generated and results will be pooled by using standard techniques taking into account the vari ation between imputed data sets (62). To take 
into account the possibility that missing outcomes  are not completely at random, we will also 
fit a pattern mixture model under MAR that will be  expanded to allow for the context of MNAR 
(62). For those participants with a missing primary outcome from the central laboratory  but with existing outcome from the local microbiolo gy laboratory, the local laboratory data will 
be used, and a sensitivity analysis will be pe rformed. A sensitivity analysis measuring the 
impact of the different reasons for missing values will also be performed. 
 
12. Data safety moni toring board 
An independent data and safety monitori ng board (DSMB), composed of 3 members 
independent of the investigators and sponso r, will be constituted prior to trial 
implementation. Its role will be to monitor the ac cumulated trial data for participants’ safety.  
Depending on this evaluation, the DSMB will make recommendations to the sponsor 
concerning the continuation, modification or term ination of the trial. There will be no planned 
interim analysis in this trial. 
The DSMB will consist of at least one STI c linical expert. Support from an independent 
statistician will be provided by ICON GPHS. An unblinded statistician will be available should 
specific requests requiring an unblinded statis tician from the data safety monitoring board 
arise. Prior to trial start, a DSMB charter an d SOP will be established and the schedule for 
subsequent, interim meetings will be determined . The format of DSMB reports will also be 
discussed.  
During the trial, the sponsor will be responsi ble for timely communicating to the DSMB all 
SAEs. In addition, the sponsor will communicate quarterly progress reports to the DSMB that 
will include safety listings and Council for Inte rnational Organizations for Medical Science 
(CIOMS) reports.  
The DSMB will be responsible for interpreting the information communicated by the sponsor 
and for determining: 

13. Quality assurance and quality control procedures 
13.1. Monitoring, audits and inspections 
Prior to trial start, a monitoring plan will be de veloped. The site principal investigator will allow 
the monitors to visit the site and facilities wher e the trial will take place in order to verify 
compliance with the trial protocol, ICH-good cl inical practice (GCP) and WHO-good clinical 
laboratory practice (GCLP) for laboratories. Training sessions on GCP, GCLP and on protocol 
implementation will be organised for the invest igators and all trial staff prior to recruitment 
start. A MOP will be distributed to all the trial centres and a laboratory manual will be distributed to all laboratories.  
Trial monitoring will be carried out by dedicated monitors at ICON GPHS at regular intervals, 
depending on the recruitment rate, to verify data  quality and trial integrity. When travel of 
monitors and/or access to clinic s is limited due to COVID-19 restrictions, remote monitoring 
is allowed to ensure continuity of monito ring where permitted and feasible locally.  
The principal investigator must allow the monitor to: 
x inspect the site, the laboratories, the facilities, the equipment and the material used 
for the trial, 
x meet all members of his/her team involved in the trial, 
x consult all of the documents relevant to the trial, including those filled by the trial 
nurse and trial pharmacist 
x check that the eCRF has been correctly completed 
x review the completion and accuracy of pharmacovigilance documentation and 
consistency with the eCRF 
x directly access source documents for comparison  of data therein with the data in the 
eCRF/data or forms sent to PV, 
x verifying that randomization has been conducted in accordance with the 
corresponding SOP and that no breach  occurred in allocation concealment 
x verify the collection, transport, storage and shipment of biological samples 
x verify that the trial is carried out in compliance with the protocol and national 
regulatory requirements 
x verify the proper handling and management of trial treatments 
At the end of each monitoring visit, and based on monitoring visit reports, the sponsor will be 
responsible for controlling: 
x recruitment rates, ineligibility, non-comp liance, protocol violations and dropouts 
overall and in each trial centre 
x completeness and timeliness of data 
x compliance with GCP, GCLP an d applicable regulations  
x any protocol deviations as defined in the monitoring plan. 
A final monitoring visit will be conducted at the e nd of the trial, after the last participant last 

13.2. Audits and inspections 
In addition to the monitoring activities foreseen  above, the trial may be evaluated by external 
auditors appointed by the sponsor and by repres entatives from national regulatory authorities 
or ethics committees who must be allowed access to eCRFs, source documents, trial files, and 
trial facilities. 
13.3. Laboratory framework 
All laboratory activities will be carried out according to the trial laboratory manual. The 
laboratory manual compiles all procedures that  are relevant to the evaluation of trial 
outcomes, and encompass pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical phases. 
Most laboratory investigations to be performed during the trial are already in use in the trial 
sites. Hence existing quality control (QC) procedures will be followed for all laboratory 
investigations. Additional quality assurance ac tivities will be implemented as necessary to 
meet GCLP standards, and oversi ght will be provided by the spon sor. Details can be found in 
the trial laboratory manual. 
14. Trial documentation 
14.1. Confidentiality and retention of trial documents 
Due to the social harm and stigma that is of ten associated with STIs, all trial sites are 
accustomed to maintaining strict confidentiality with regards to their patients. Most sites are 
dedicated STI clinics. All trial-related information will be stored securely at the trial sites. All 
participant information will be stored in locked fi le cabinets in areas with access limited to site 
staff.  
All laboratory specimens, reports, trial data colle ction, process, and administrative forms will 
be identified by a coded number only to maintain  participant confidentiality. All records that 
contain names or other personal identifiers, such as locator forms and informed consent 
forms, will be stored separately from trial records identified by code number. All local 
databases will be secured with password-protected access systems. Forms, lists, logbooks, appointment books, and any other listings that li nk participant ID numbers to other identifying 
information will be stored in a separate, locked file in an area with limited access. 
Participant’s trial information will not be rele ased without the written permission of the 
participant, except as necessary for monitori ng by the sponsor, the DSMB, the NRAs or 
IRBs/IECs. The principal investigator should agree to provide access to all trial information and documents to sponsor representatives, audi tors and inspector mandated by NRAs. The 
information will be treated in compliance with professional secrecy. 
The investigators must arrange for the retentio n of all information relevant to the trial, 
including a copy of the eCRF along with audit trail and essential documents listed in Section 8 
of ICH-GCP, for at least 15 years after completion  or termination of the trial. After that period 
of time, the documents may be destroyed with pr ior permission from the sponsor, subject to 
local regulations. Should the investigator wish to assign the trial records to another party or 
move them to another location, the sponsor must be notified in advance. 
14.2. Protocol amendment 
If the protocol must be altered after it has been signed, the modification or amendment must 

Confidential  Page 64 of 74 
 be discussed and approved by the sponsor. The protocol amendment must be drafted and 
signed by both parties. All amendments must be  submitted to the relevant ethics committees 
and NRAs. Administrative amendments can be  implemented immediately but amendments 
that affect other aspects can only be implemented after a favourable opinion of the ethics committee and NRA has been obtained and local regulatory requirements have been complied 
with. An amendment needed to eliminate immediat e hazards to the participants in the trial is 
exempted from this rule. When the submission is performed by the principal investigator, the 
latter must transmit a copy of ethics comm ittee’s new written opinion to the sponsor, 
immediately upon receipt. 
When a protocol amendment results in revi sed informed consent forms, after IRB/EC 
approval, re-consent will be obtained from part icipants currently enrolled into the trial in a 
timely manner at or before the participant’s next  trial visit. This will allow sufficient time and 
information to make a decision about conti nued participation in the research trial. 
14.3. Final trial reports 
A final trial report summarising the trial outc ome will be drafted by the investigators and 
provided to the local IEC/IRB.  
A clinical trial report will be prepared by the sponsor with input from investigators as 
appropriate. One copy of the final trial report must be dated and signed by the sponsor’s medical monitor, principal investigators, trial st atistician and the clinic al trial manager before 
being transmitted to the IRB/IECs and NRAs. 
 15. Early termination of the trial 
Both the sponsor and the investig ators reserve the right to termin ate the trial at any time prior 
to inclusion of the intended number of participan ts, but they intend to exercise this right only 
for valid scientific or administrative reasons. Should this be necessary, both parties will 
arrange the procedures after review and consul tation. In terminating the trial, the sponsor 
and the investigators will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the 
participants’ interests. 
Reasons for early termination of the trial by the sponsor may include but are not limited to:  
x enrolment rate too low 
x protocol violations 
x inaccurate or incomplete data 
x unsafe or unethical practices 
x questionable safety of the test article 
x following the recommendation of the DSMB or IEC 
x administrative decision 
Reasons for early termination of the trial by the investigators may be: 
x insufficient time or reso urce to conduct the trial 
x lack of eligible participants. 
In the event that the trial is termin ated early, the investigator has to: 
x complete the eCRF to the greater extent possible 

 x answer all questions of the sponsors or their representatives related to data of 
participants enrolled at the si te prior to trial termination 
x ensure that participants enrolled in the trial who had not yet reached a follow up time

 16. Ethics 
16.1. Trial conduct 
The trial will be conducted in accordance with  the ethical principles laid down in the 
declaration of Helsinki 1964, as revised in Fo rtaleza in 2013, the ICH-GCP, the WHO-GCLP and 
with all applicable national regulations. 
16.2. Regulatory and ethical approval  
The trial protocol, the participant ICF, the eCRF, up -to-date versions of the IB or SmPC, as well 
as principal investigators qualifications will be submitted to appropriate IRBs/IECs.  
The trial will not start in any centre before written approval by these IRBs/IECs has been 
obtained, the local regulatory requirements have been complied with, and the signature of the clinical trial protocol of each cont ractual party involved has been obtained. 
16.3. Informed consent process 
An ICF in clear, simple language complying with  new Common Rule (45 CFR part 46 subpart A) 
requirements will be provided to the participant.  The investigator or designee is to collect 
written consent from each participant before an y trial-specific procedure is conducted. Two 
original ICFs must be completed, dated and si gned personally by the participant and by the 
investigator or designated trial staff. The partic ipant should be given one signed original form; 
the second original should be  kept by the investigator. 
Adolescent participants ( ≥ 12 and < 18 years old) will be consented according to the practice 
in use in their country of origin. If required by local research ethics guidelines, assent will be 
sought from participants and consent will be so ught from a legal representative in addition. 
In countries that recognize the status of emancipated minors, consent will be sought from the 
participant directly.  
If the participant is unable to read, a relative or an impartial witness should be present during 
the informed consent discussion. The participant must give consent orally and, if capable of 
doing so, complete, sign (or thumbprint) and personally date the information and consent 
form. The witness must then complete, sign and date the form to testify of the participant’s 
understanding of the trial information and his/he r willingness to participate, together with the 
investigator. 
The ICF will be provided to the principal investigators by the sponsor. Any changes to the ICF 
suggested by the principal investigator must be agreed to by the sponsor before submission to the IRB/IEC, and a copy of the approved ve rsion must be provided to the sponsor after 
IRB/IEC approval. Any change to  the ICF after the initial approval constitutes an amendment 
and must be submitted for approval  to the IRB/IEC, and to the NRA.  

 16.4. Justification for selection of trial population 
The inclusion of minors in the present trial is ju stified from an ethical perspective by the fact 
that prevalence of STIs among adolescents is us ually high and zoliflodacin given as a single 
dose appears to be safe based on non-clinical and clinical studies (see IB). This vulnerable 
group will benefit from the knowledge and in tervention generated by the present trial. 
Gathering of PK data from adolescents, who usua lly have lower body weights, is key to inform 
dosing adjustment if necessary. 
HIV positive participants will be eligible for incl usion in the trial, as long as their ART does not 
contain any of the prohibited medications.  
16.5. Community engagement 
Prior to trial start, relevant communities, such  as women’s group, youth, men who have sex 
with men (MSM) groups, and other key populations  in trial sites will be informed. Community 
meetings will be held to inform these groups of th e trial prior to the trial. Feedback on the trial 
concept will also be gathered through community meetings wherever possible. Follow-up meetings will also be done to provide progress of  the trial. Moreover, results of the trial will 
be disseminated to these communities. During these meeting the communities will be assured 
of maintaining confidentiality and reducing stigma.  
16.6. Risks and benefits 
Clinical findings with zoliflodacin:  
To date, zoliflodacin as a single dose has been  well tolerated by both healthy subjects and 
patients included in the clinical development program. Most commonly reported AEs included excluding infection-related AEs were mild gastro-intestinal events (nausea and diarrhoea) and 
headache. There were no AEs reported at a frequency of ≥5%  
Non-clinical findings with zoliflodacin:  
Mild testicular degenerations were observed in  rat and dog studies, and reprotoxicity studies 
in rodent showed a slight adv erse effect on male and female fertility as well as embryofoetal 
development after multiple dosing for 14-28 days. Zoliflodacin has not been studied in pregnant women, and hence all women participan ts of child bearing potential should not be 
pregnant or have a negative pregnancy test at enrolment and use effective contraceptive 
methods for 30 days after receipt of zoliflodacin.  Male participants with female partners of 
child bearing potential must agree to delay conception for 28 days after treatment, and conduct abstinence/use effective barrier contraceptive methods to avoid exposure during pregnancy for 30 days after receipt of zoliflod acin. As with all antibiotics, allergic and 
hypersensitivity reactions are a potential risk. Plea se refer to section 6.1.2 of this protocol and 
to the latest version of the IB for a full desc ription of the identified and potential risks 
associated with zoliflodacin.  
Potential risks associat ed with ceftriaxone: 
The main risk associated with ceftriaxone is the risk of anaphylaxis, and ceftriaxone is contra-
indicated in individuals with known severe allerg y to cephalosporins or penicillin. In clinical 
trials, the most frequently reported AEs for ceftriaxone are eosinophilia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, rash, and hepatic en zymes increased. Injection site reaction at 
site of intramuscular injection are expected an d the use of concomitant lidocaine will mitigate 
risk of severe injection site pain. Please refer to the ceftriaxone SmPC for a full description of 

 the identified and potential risks associated with ceftriaxone. 
Potential risks associat ed with azithromycin: 
As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions including 
angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis (rarely fa tal), dermatologic reactions including acute 
generalised exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (rarely fatal) and drug reaction with eosinophi lia and systemic symptoms have been reported. 
If an allergic reaction occurs, appropriate ther apy should be instituted. Physicians should be 
aware that reappearance of the allergic symp toms may occur when symptomatic therapy is 
discontinued. Please refer to the azithromycin Sm PC for a full description of the identified and 
potential risks associat ed with azithromycin. 
Potential risks associated with lidocaine: 
Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic of the amide ty pe that is approved for use as a diluent for 
ceftriaxone. Reactions to lidocaine include cutaneous lesions, urticaria, oedema or anaphylactoid reactions. Pruritis, burning, oedema, erythema, purpura, and bleeding may occur at the local injection site. Allergic reactions  may occur as a result of sensitivity to local 
anaesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used  as a preservative in multiple dose vials. 
Allergic reactions as a result of sens itivity to lidocaine are extremely rare. 
Risks associated with trial participation: 
Trial procedures related risks include risks asso ciated with some of the trial procedures. For 
instance, venepuncture causes transient discomfo rt and may cause fainting. Bruising at the 
site of venepuncture may occur. Infection at th e site is possible but highly unlikely as aseptic 
technique will be used.  
It is possible that participants' involvement in  the trial could become known to others, and 
that a social impact may result. For example, pa rticipants could be treated unfairly, or could 
have problems being accepted by their families and/or communities. In the event that a 
participant reports a social impact, every effo rt will be made by trial staff to provide 
appropriate care and counselling to the part icipant as necessary, and/or referral to 
appropriate resources for the safety of the participant.  
Benefits from trial participation: 
Participants in this trial will benefit from having a comprehensive STI case management 
including laboratory tests for NG and CT resultin g in faster and better-informed treatment of 
STIs.  
If positive, the trial will benefit future pati ents with gonorrhoea by providing the necessary 
evidence to support introduction of a new antibi otic against drug sensit ive and drug-resistant 
gonorrhoea. Given the pace at which resistance to ESC is emerging and spreading globally, it is likely that the incidence of treatment failur es to the currently-recommended treatment will 
increase in the near future. At the same time  the 5% resistance thre shold set by WHO, US-
CDC and other organizations will soon be reac hed, and alternative treatment options are 
urgently required.   
16.7. HIV status and voluntary counselling and testing 
HIV positive participants are eligible for incl usion in this trial. Participants without a 
documented positive HIV diagnosis or documented  prescription of ART will undergo voluntary 

 counselling and testing (VCT) for HIV as part of  the trial baseline assessments, and as per local 
routine procedures. All HIV positive individuals will be offered counselling, referred for HIV 
care and treatment, in line with routine practice in trial sites. This may either be done at the 
same time as consent is obtained for inclusion in the trial or at a later date according to 
hospital practice. Participants who are found to  be HIV positive will be referred onwards for 
treatment, surveillance and follow up according to the national protocol for HIV positive 
participants. Participants on pr e- or post- exposure prophylaxis for HIV infection may enrol in 
the trial provided they meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria including 
those pertinent to disallowed concomitant medications. 
16.8. Compensation 
All trial treatments and diagnostic test costs w ill be supported by the sponsor. Participants will 
receive compensation for their time spent for tr ial participation as pe r local standards.  
16.9. Insurance and liability 
As sponsor of the trial, GARDP is liable for and shall indemnify any claims and damages brought 
by a trial participant suffering from an injury, which arises out of the performance of the trial 
in accordance with the protocol. To this e nd, GARDP has taken an insurance covering the 
conduct of the trial and all participants. 
16.10.  Post-trial access 
If the present trial is successful in demonstratin g zoliflodacin is non-inferior to the comparator 
regimen, the sponsor intends to use trial results to support a request for registration in all trial 
countries. In addition, the sponsor will develop a stewardship and access strategy that will 
accompany the roll out of zoliflodacin in target countries and ensure zoliflodacin is promptly 
available to future gonorrhoea patients.  
 
17. Reporting and publication 
17.1. International registry  of clinical trials  
The present trial was registered in the clinicaltr ials.gov public register prior to start (NCT # 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
17.2. Publication 
Upon trial completion and finalisation of the trial report, the results of the trial will be either 
submitted for publication and/or posted in a p ublicly accessible database of clinical trial 
results. Authorship of any publication will be based on the uniform requirements for 
manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals as defined by the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).

 Appendix 1: Contraception methods considered as highly effective 
For the purpose of this trial methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year 
when used consistently and correctly are co nsidered as highly effective birth control 
methods. Such methods, and the duratio n of required adherence prior to IMP 
administration, include:  
- combined (estrogen and progestogen contai ning) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:  
x oral (required for at least 7 da ys prior to IMP administration) 
x intravaginal (required for at least 7 days prior to IMP administration) 
x transdermal (required for at least 7 days prior to IMP administration) 
- progestogen-only hormonal contraception a ssociated with inhibition of ovulation:  
x oral (required for at least 7 days prior to IMP administration)  
x injectable (required for at least 7 days prior to IMP administration) 
x implantable (required for at least 7 days prior to IMP administration) 
- intrauterine device (IUD) (any ti me prior to IMP administration) 
- intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS ) (any time prior to IMP administration) 
- bilateral tubal occlusion (any ti me prior to IMP administration) 
- vasectomised partner1 (at least 3 months prior to IMP  administration and verified by 
partner semen analysis) 
All contraceptive methods must be continued unt il at least 28 days post IMP administration.  
1 Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control meth od provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
female of child-bearing potential trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of 
the surgical success.

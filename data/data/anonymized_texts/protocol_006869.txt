OBJECTIVE S 1. To compare the diagnostic effectiveness of Ablavar ®-
based ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  with Feraheme ®-
based ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  in pediatric patients 
with CHD. (Study Part I)  
2. To determine the diagnostic effectiveness of an accelerated 
self-gated MUSIC -MRI  cardiovascular MRI technique 
(henceforth referred to as ‘self -gated MUSIC -MRI ’) for 
pediatric patients with CHD, which ultimately may not 
require sedation or general anesthesia. (Study Part II)  
3. To summarize the safety of Feraheme® and Ablavar® as 
an MRI contrast agent in pediatric patients with CHD.  
MUSIC -MRI  (MUltiphase Steady -state Imaging with Contrast 
enhancement is a high resolution 3D cardiac -gated 
cineangiographic imaging technique played out over multiple 
time phases of the cardiac cycle. The MUSIC -MRI  sequence 
is described in Han et al.  (1) 
  BRIEF  
RATIONALE  The s tandard clinical cardiovascular MRI practice  for children 
with CHD  frequently involves  the use of gadolinium -based 
contrast agents (GBCA) to enhance tissue contrast. Most 
GBCAs are small molecules that quickly cross the capillary 
wall and access  the interstitial space, a process which 
diminishes the signal contrast between blood vessels and 
surrounding tissue. Therefore, these types of GBCA are most 
useful for first -pass MR angiography, wherein the images are 
acquired quickly during the initial 15 -30 seconds post -
injection when the GBCA concentrat ion is much higher in the 
arteries than in the interstitial space. For young children with 
complex CHD , the stringent requirements for high spatial 
resolution, and the need for cardiac gating and good blood -
myocardium contrast  in order to provide detailed evaluation of 
intracardiac structures are not compatible with conventional 
GBCA -based first -pass MR angiography. Even with Ablavar ® 
(gadofosveset trisodium) , an FDA approved GBCA with 
longer  intravascular half -life than other  GBCA s, cardiac -gated 
Ablavar ®-enhanced MRI may be  insufficient  for young 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 9 of 59 
 children with CHD  based on our institutional experience  and 
on data from the literature ; there remains diminished blood -
tissue contrast during the high-resolution cardiac -gated MRI.  
Furthermore , there have been safety concerns regarding 
gadolinium deposition in brain tissues  after repeated GBCA 
exposure  as well as concerns of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis 
(NSF) associated with GBCA injection in young children < 2 
years old who may have immature renal function. The long -
term health consequences of these effects in the pediatric 
population are unclear.  For the above reasons, we seek to study  
the diagnostic imaging effectiveness  of Feraheme  
(Feraheme® ), an FDA -approved drug  for parenteral iron 
suppl ement ation , as an MRI contrast agent in children with 
CHD. Although Feraheme ® has been approved for the 
treatment of iron deficiency anemia secondary to renal disease, 
Feraheme ® has been used as an off -label MRI contrast agent  
at select medical centers , including a Stanford study of 
Feraheme ®-enhanced pediatric tumor imaging under a 
separate IND .  
  STUDY DESIGN  The study has two parts:  
Part I : Open-label , exploratory , case-control , single -center  
diagnostic efficacy  study  in 80 children (age newborn -6 years 
old) to compare Feraheme ®-enhanced and Ablavar ®-
enhanced MRI  
Part II : Open -label, exploratory, single -center diagnostic 
efficacy  study in 40 children (age newborn -6 years old) to 
validate advanced MRI techniques  to enable respiratory -
motion self-gated  image acquisition s. Such acquisition 
strategies may ultimately enable high -resolution 4D MRI of 
children with CHD who undergo MRI during free -breathing 
without sedation or anesthesia.

Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 11 of 59 
 and compared with respiratory motion self -gated MUSIC -MRI  
using the contrast agent determi ned in Part I.  The image quality 
scoring  for both Part I and Part II  will be performed for 7 
anatomical structures  that are important for pediatric CHD 
patients,  (i.e. aortic root, main pulmonary artery, coronary 
arteries, ventricular out-flow tracts, valves, ventric ular 
chambers , and atria ) using a 1 -4 point scale . Image sharpness 
across lumen -wall interfaces will be quantified using 
established methods at the interventricular septum and  the 
ascending aorta.  The blood -myocardium contrast -to-noise 
ratio will be quantified using established methods.  
PRIMARY EFFICACY  
ENDPOINT  Composite image quality score among the 7 anatomical 
structures  (aortic root, main pulmonary artery, coronary 
arteries, ventricular outflow tracts, valves, ventric ular 
chambers , atria ). 
SECONDARY  
EFFICACY  
ENDPOINT  1. Image quality score at the aortic root.  
2. Image quality score at the main pulmonary artery.  
3. Image quality score at the coronary arteries.  
4. Image quality score at the out -flow tracts.  
5. Image quality score at the valves.  
6. Image quality score at the ventricular chambers .

SAFETY 
EVALUATIONS  Safety Evaluations : 
1.  Incidence of acute AE will be monitored.  
2.  Continuous patient monitoring and recording of vital signs 
(pre-, during, and at least  30 min-post contrast agent injection) 
will be provided by expert and specialized staff, including 
pediatric anesthesiologists and /or staff from the UCLA 
Neonatal or  Pediatric Intensive Care Units.   
3. Incidence of other AE up to 60 days post -MRI  via a medical 
record review .  
 
Procedures to Reduce Risks of Feraheme  Infusion : 
1. All patients will be screened for contraindications to 
Feraheme ® administration, including a history of allergy 
to intravenous iron products and iron overload.  
2. Performing MRI in newborns to 6 years of age under 
sedation and/or general anesthesia with airwa y protection 
is considered the standard of care at most institutions 
performing pediatric cardiac MRI  for this age group . In the 
case of a clinically urgent or life -threatening AE during the 
procedure , there will already be in place full airway 
protection and support of respiration.  
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 12 of 59 
 3. Patients will undergo continuous monitoring of heart rate, 
blood pressure, oxygen saturation and ECG tracing for the 
duration of the MRI procedure and, at a minimum, 30 min 
after the injection . In the case of a clinically impor tant AE, 
changes in vital signs will be evident immediately and 
appropriate treatment initiated. Protocols are in place to 
deal with acute AEs related to hypersensitivity and/or 
anaphylaxis.  
4. The dose of Feraheme ® will be up to 4 mg /kg 
(approximately half the single therapy dose), diluted with 
saline and infused slowly  per FDA guidelines .  
PLANNED INTERIM 
ANALYSES  Part I  
After 50% enrollment is achieved in both the test and control 
groups, the Investigators will convene the DMC and request an 
interim analysis . The Investigators will not be blinded to the 
treatment assignment or to the images, but only to the image 
quality scores, which will be provided by independent  
experienced readers. If statistical significance is achieved for 
the primary efficacy endpoint in the interim analyses, the 
Investigator s will close enrollment for Part I and will begin 
enrollment for Part II . If statistical significance is not achieved 
during the interim analyses, we will continue recruiting 
patients into the two groups ( Feraheme ® and Ablavar ®) and 
the final statistical analyses will require a 0.025 level of 
confidence to claim statistical significance.  
 
Part I I 
There will be no interim analyses in Part II of our study.  
 
Safety Evaluations  
Adverse events  (AEs)  will reviewed and  monitored by the 
DMC  on a quarterly  basis . SAE s will be reported within 48 
hours and the DMC  will be convened within one week to 
evaluate the protocol.  
  STATISTICS  
 PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT S:   
 
Part I : Diagnostic efficacy study in 80 children (age 
newborn -6 years old) to compare Feraheme® -enhanced and 
Ablavar® -enhanced MRI  
 
Control Group= Ablavar® + MUSIC -MRI 
Test Group= Feraheme® + MUSIC -MRI  
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 13 of 59 
  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the sum of diagnostic image  
quality score s (i.e. the composite score) from the 7 pre -
identified anatomical structure s. A parametric two -sided t -test 
will be used to compare the Feraheme ® group and the 
Ablavar ® group where both groups will use ventilator -gated 
MUSIC -MRI . This compari son will be a two -sided test at the 
0.05 level of significance. A formal  interim analysis for the 
image quality will be performed when  20 CHD subjects in each 
group  have completed the image acquisition . The interim 
analysis will be prepared by an independe nt statistician and 
presented only to the independent DMC who will make 
recommendations about the ongoing conduct of the study. Two 
hypotheses will be used to preserve the overall type 1 error rate 
of 0.05 between this single interim analysis and the final  
analysis of the mean differenc es in the composite image 
quality scores. A two -sample t -test will be used to compare the 
Feraheme ®-enhanced and the Ablavar ®-enhanced groups for 
the primary  analysis at the 0.025 level of significance.  
 
Part II :  Diagnostic efficacy study to compare self -gated 
MUSIC -MRI with ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI in 40 
children  
 
Control = Contrast agent from Part I + ventilator -gated 
MUSIC -MRI  
Test = Contrast agent from Part I + self -gated MUSIC -MRI  
 
Part II will start after result s from Part I are available.  The 
superior contrast  agent  as determined by  Part I  of the study  or 
in the case that statistical significance is not achieved in Part I, 
the appropriate contrast  agent  in consultation with the DMC 
will be used for Part II . The primary efficacy endpoint is the 
composite image quality score from the 7 pre -identified 
anatomical structure s. A parametric two -sided paired t -test will 
be used to compare the ventilator -gated  MUSIC -MRI  and self -
gated MUSIC -MRI  groups. The quality of the self -gated 
MUSIC -MRI  images is  expected to be not much worse than 
those from ventilator -gated  MUSIC -MRI  images. This 
comparison of non -inferiority will be a one -sided test at the 
0.025 level of significance with a -1.75  margin in the  
composite  image quality score.  
 
SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS : 
 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 14 of 59 
 Part I : 
The image quality score for each individual anatomical 
structure will be compared  between  the two contrast agents .  
1. Image quality score at the aortic root.  
2. Image quality score at the main pulmonary artery.  
3. Image quality score at the coronary arteries.  
4. Image quality score at the out -flow tracts.  
5. Image quality score at the valves.  
6. Image quality score at the ventricular chambers.  
7. Image quality score at the atria.  
8. Sharpness value at the interve ntricular septum.  
9. Sharpness value at the ascending aorta . 
A parametric  two-sided  t-test will be performed after an 
appropriate transformation of individual score if needed . 
Similar ly, the sharpness values  and the CNR  will be compared  
between the two groups using a  two-sided   t-test. 
 
Part II : 
The image quality score for each individual anatomical 
structure will be compared  between the two techniques 
(ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  vs. self -gated MUSIC -MRI ). A 
paired t -test will be used to determine the difference in image 
quality score s using appropriate transformation if needed. 
Similarly, t he sharpness values and the CNR will be compared  
between the two groups using a  two-sided  t-test. 
 
SAFETY EVALUATIONS : 
 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, 
vital signs recordings, and any relevant clinical laboratory test 
data (including change from baseline). Safety analyses will

4 BACKGROUND  
Contrast agents are used in cardiovascular M RI to augment tissue contrast. These agents typically 
exert strong T1 effects , which enhance MRI signal and tissue contrast. The large majority  of 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 16 of 59 
 compounds used clinically are  gadolinium -based contrast agents ( GBCA ), which contain 
gadolinium  (Gd) , a paramagnetic rare earth metal not found naturally in biological systems.  
4.1 Overview of Cardiovascular MRI  
Cardiovascular MRI (CVMRI) refers to a group of MRI techniques that address anatomical, 
structural and functional assessment of the cardiovascular system. CVMRI has a number of 
advantages compared to other non -invasive imagin g modalities, including lack of ionizing 
radiation, inherent 3D capabilities, unrestricted field of view (FOV) and flexibility in combining 
spatial and temporal resolution.  Uniquely, MRI can generate a wide range of soft tissue contrast 
to image specific aspects of the magnetic state of the tissues. In order to make an MR image, 
radiowave pulses and magnetic field gradient pulses are applied in a specific and customized order, 
called a ‘pulse sequence’, to highlight the properties of tissue magnetization m ost relevant to the 
clinical question. The administration of pharmaceutical contrast agents, such as GBCA and 
ferumoxytol, result in dramatic changes in the sensitivity of MRI to these tissue properties and the 
biodistribution of the agent is reflected in the image.  In many situations, both contrast -enhanced 
and non -contrast enhanced images are acquired and may provide complementary information. For 
vascular anatomical assessment, techniques such as contrast -enhanced MR angiography (CE -
MRA) and non -contrast  balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) are often used to define 
vascular and cardiac anatomy. For functional assessment,  sequential 2 -dimensional  cardiac cine 
imaging is the most widely used MRI technique for quantifying functional parameters of th e heart, 
such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.  
Most MRI techniques require several seconds to several minutes to acquire and if an imaged organ 
moves during this time, the image becomes degraded by artifact. In all cases, gross body movement 
must be avoided and this is achieved in cooperative patients by requesting that they make no 
voluntary movements during the scan . However, some physiological movements, such as cardiac, 
respiratory and bowel peristalsis are partially or wholly involuntary and, for these, specific 
corrective or preventative maneuvers must be implemented. Therefore, c ardiovascular MRI 
generally requires physiological motion compensation techniques for both cardiac and respiratory 
motion. The ECG signal is commonly used as a c ardiac gating signal, although its reliability at 
higher field strengths (>= 3 Tesla) is more limited due to artifact caused by blood flowing in a 
stronger magnetic field ( magnetohydrodynamic  effect)  (2). Respiratory motion artifact can be 
mitigated by breath holding, as and when appropriate , or by pausing mechanical ventilation in 
children (3). However, the maximum duration of a breath hold (on the order of 30 seconds) sets 
an upper li mit on the amount of spatial and temporal detail that can be acquired in that time with 
MRI. Whereas modern scanners can acquire sufficient detail in this time for a 3 -dimensional image 
without cardiac gating (such as for the first pass of a GBCA bolus), c ardiac gated, multi -phase 3 -
dimensional imaging takes several minutes to acquire and is therefore in compatible with breath -
holding.  Techniques exist to compensate for breathing motion artifact when image acquisition 
takes sever al minutes. The motion of the diaphragm can be monitored by a so called ‘navigator 
echo’, sampled regularly at the lung -liver interface such that the image acquisition can be restricted 
to a specific time wi ndow within the breathing cycle . Such a navigator -gating strategy reduces 
respiratory motion related image blurring; however, the navigator sampling process takes time  and 
interrupts the continuous radiowave pulsing necessary,  and is therefore not well suited to 
techniques that sample the full cardiac cycle in steady state and wh ich may undergo retrospective 
data sorting, such as MUSIC -MRI in our protocol . The current study will utilize two alternative 
respiratory motion compensation strategies which do not interrupt the steady state: 1) ventilator 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 17 of 59 
 gating and 2) respiratory motion  self-gating. With both methods, the radiofrequency and gradient 
activity continues without interruption throughout the entire respiratory and cardiac cycles. The 
ventilator gating strategy uses the air pressure signal from the endotracheal  tube in patient s 
undergoing positive pressure ventilation and directly reflects the ventilator driving pressure. 
Hence, this technique is not applicable to patients breathing spontaneously. For these cases, a 
promising alternative strategy is respiratory motion self -gating (4), whereby respiratory motion is 
detected by its periodic effect on the amplitude of the continuously acquired MRI signal, without 
the need for a navigator preparation. Respiratory self -gated cardiovascular MRI has the followin g 
benefits compared to navigators: 1) it does not disrupt the steady state MRI signal and allows us 
to capture the entire cardiac cycle during our MUSIC -MRI  cardiac -phase resolved scans; 2) it 
provides a direct account of the effect of respiratory motion o n the organ of interest.  
4.2 Challenge of Cardiovascular MRI in C hildren  
The clinical value of MR is well established for a variety of cardiovascular disorders  (5–9). 
Children  with congenital heart disease ( CHD ) typically have both intra -cardiac and extra -cardiac  
vascular  anomalies. Therefore, the ability to visualize both types of morpho logic abnormalities is 
crucial.  Although echocardiography is readily  available, it may leave several morphologic and 
hemodynamic questions unresolved  due to issues such as inadequate acoustic window . Cardiac 
CT with either single or dual source technology can yield high spatial resolution images with 
increasingly small rad iation doses.  However, sub -milliSievert doses are achievable only in the 
most ideal situations (low body mass index, sinus rhythm with excellent beta blockade).  Exposure 
to radiation, however low the dose, should be considered only when alternative method s are not 
available.  Furthermore, neonates and infants may have heart rates that challenge the temporal 
resolution of even dual source CT scanners.  With MRI, the temporal resolution of cine imaging 
can be adjusted to cope with even the fastest heart rate s (10). MRI has been shown to be a versatile, 
non-invasive, and non -radiating technique for the evaluation of neonates, infants, and children, 
including those who are critically ill (9,11,12) .  
 
In young children, the small caliber of the heart and blood vessels require s higher spatial resolution 
than in adults (5,7)  for comparable detail. For adults and larger children, spatial resolution as 
previously reported (13–15) may be entirely adequate ; for small ch ildren with diminutive central 
vessels, the requirements for high spatial resolution are much more stringent.   Further, children 
(particularly newborns to age 6) also often require the MRI exam to be done under general 
anesthesia  (9) as they are unable to obey commands and may be  critically -ill. 
4.3 MRI clinical standard of care in children with CHD  
In children with CHD , echocardiography is universally re garded as the primary diagnostic imaging 
modality. When echocardiography is inconclusive, MRI is the preferred second line imaging 
modality due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the ability to incorporate functional as well 
as anatomic information. MRI for pediatric CHD routinely involves the use of GBCAs  to evaluate 
extra -cardiac vascular anatomy, which may be complex and anomalous , but knowledge of which 
is essential  to inform patient management. Gd is a rare earth metal not found naturally in biol ogical 
systems, but with paramagnetic properties that greatly enhance the MRI signal.  Because free Gd 
ions are toxic, GBCAs are stable chelates wherein the Gd ions are tightly bound with very high 
association constants.  The chelating molecule in turn modu lates the biological distribution, 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 18 of 59 
 potency and pharmacokinetics of the contrast agent. Most GBCAs are small diffusible molecules 
that, following bolus intravenous injection, sustain a short intravascular peak and quickly access 
the interstitial space. Ther efore, these extracellular GBCA are useful mainly for first -pass MR 
angiography, wherein the images are acquired during the initial 15 -30 seconds post -injection 
before the GBCA leaks from the intravascular space. In children with CHD, this limited time 
window will gener ally preclude simultaneous high -resolution cardiac and vascular image 
acquisition, due to the requirement for gating to freeze cardiac motion. However, high resolution 
imaging of the intracardiac structures, including the great arteries, the cardiac chambers, the 
valves, and the coronary arteries  and the outflow tracts , is essential for planning surgery or other 
interventions for these patients.  
 
Ablavar (Ablavar®, Lantheus Medical) is a GBCA, which binds reversibly to plasma proteins and 
therefore has a longer intravascular residence time and higher potency (r1 relaxivity) than the 
purely extracellular gadolinium agents.  At any time, 70% - 80% of  the Ablavar in the blood is 
reversibly bound to serum albumin and the remainder is distributed in the extracellular space.  The 
binding to plasma proteins slows the initial distribution of Ablavar from the blood pool to the 
extracellular fluid space such that, whereas for the purely extracellular GBCAs the distribution 
half life is < 5 minutes, for Ablavar the distribution half life is on the order of 25 minutes. Because 
of its longer intravascular residence time, Ablavar extends the useful time window for  vascular 
imaging to 20 -30 minutes beyond the first pass. Once the distribution phase is complete, Ablavar 
and the other GBCAs are diluted by the extracellular fluid space (~15 liters in an average adult or 
~30% of body weight in a child under 6 years) and  their effectiveness in enhancing the vascular 
signal  is correspondingly diminished.  Therefore, from the perspective of vascular MRI, the 
duration of the initial distribution phase is the most relevant because the strength of the vascular 
signal is determi ned by the concentration of the agent in the blood when the scan is being 
performed. Once di stributed, the elimination half -life (due to renal excretion) of Ablavar is on the 
order of 19 hours.  
 
Ablavar is approved as a contrast agent for MR angiography i n adult patients with peripheral 
vascular disease and has become the agent of choice at many institutions for pediatric CHD.  
Compared to the purely extracellular GBCAs, Ablavar has higher potency per unit dose of Gd (r1 
relaxivity), provides a longer time  window for vascular imaging and leaks into the interstitial fluid 
space more slowly. However, like the extracellular GBCAs, its primary mode of elimination is by 
renal filtration of the unbound plasma fraction. Although this is an improvement over the pur ely 
extracellular agents, an even longer vascular residence time would be desirable in children for 
several reasons. Firstly, for combined and simultaneous high -resolution cardiac and vascular 
imaging in CHD patients, the concentration of contrast agent in  the blood should remain constant 
over the several minutes of the imaging scan.  Secondly, in patients under anesthesia or sedation 
it is sometimes necessary to interrupt or repeat a scan if the anesthesiologist needs to adjust the 
depth or type of sedatio n on a patient specific basis.  Inadequate sedation may result in patient 
motion artifact which can re nder the study non -diagnostic. Time spent adjusting the sedation 
parameters and confirming physiologic stability may push the image acquisition window bey ond 
the optimum time window for Ablavar, resulting in diminished image quality even if motion 
artifact is absent.

 Therefore, the  overall effect of Ablavar ® is qualitatively similar to the GBCAs  with similar 
limitations , but on an expanded time scale  which may be adequate if the study goes smoothly but 
which may result in compromised image quality if scans need to be paused or repeated. The 
hypothesized advantages of Feraheme over Ablavar are the purer and much longer intravascular 
residence time (intrava scular half life of 15 hours vs 0.5 hours), such that high -resolution steady -
state cardiac and vascular imaging can be completed successfully, whether or not scans need to be 
paused  or repeated .  
4.4 Safety C oncerns with GBCAs  
GBCAs have been used for over a q uarter of a century  and have a highly favorable safety profile, 
which is predominantly ba sed on their stability in vivo.  GBCAs are chelates designed to tightly 
bind gadolinium ions because f ree gadolinium ions are toxic  (16). In recent years, some safety 
concerns have been raised relating to the association of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) with 
GBCA exposure for patients with renal impairment, and observation of gadolinium deposition in 
brain tissue , even in patients with  normal renal function (17–22). The gadolinium deposition in 
tissue  may be particularly worrying in  children  because  of their projected  life-expectancy and in 
whom Gd may potentially persist indefinitely . Furthermore, there are concerns of hypersensitivity 
to GBCA injections  (23,24)  and association of Ablavar with prolongation of the QT interval on 
the ECG, which may pose more concern for cardiac arrhythmias in children with CHD than those 
with normal hearts.  
 
[Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) ] In 2006, associations between NSF and GBCA exposure 
(25,26)  led to a boxed warning alert by the US FDA (27) and the EMA  (28) to restrict the use of 
GBCAs in patients with renal insufficiency. Autopsy studies have reported the p resence of 
gadolinium in skin, heart, blood vessels, lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney, and dura of 
patients with NSF (16). Almost a decade later however, the pathophysiology of NSF remains 
unclear.  Nevertheless, a consistent body of literature does suggest that slow clearance of GBCAs 
in patients with impaired renal function predisposes to transmetalation with release of fr ee 
gadolinium ions, which have fibrogenic effects (29). The diagnosis of NSF is complex (30) and 
should only be made when clinical and histopathological criter ia set forth by the Yale NSF 
Registry are met (31). NSF is described as skin discoloration and swelling progressing to 
erythematous papules, brawny lesions, and subcutaneous sclerosis (32,33)  and occurs within 2 -3 
months of exposure to GBCAs, but late onset cases have been reported (34). Recently, a new 
entity, termed gadolinium -associated plaques, was reported in two patients by Gathings et al . (35), 
whereby neither patient had NSF while only one patient had renal failure. Both patients, however, 
had erythematous plaques associated with sclerotic bodies though t to be pathognomonic for NSF. 
This occurrence was related to gadodiamide.  
 
The r isk of GBCA -associated NSF is highest in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR ) < 30mL/min/1.73m2 (1-7%) and those with acute renal failure (12 -20%) . The risk is lower 
for those with moderately decreased renal function (30 -59mL/min/1.73m2) and even less for those 
with mild renal impairment (60 -89mL/min/1.73m2). While there are a multitude of publications 
on GBCA -associated NSF, the most interesting reports are cases in which NSF did not develop in 
those with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD ) (15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 eGFR), who were 
exposed to high doses of GBCAs (36,37) . It is thought that other confounding risk factors beyond 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 20 of 59 
 impaired renal func tion such as concomitant acidosis, infection, acute pro -inflammatory events, 
immunosuppression, high -dose erythropoietin therapy, elevated iron /calcium /phosphate levels, 
and vasculopathy may play a role in the initiation of the NSF disease cascade.  
 
Zou et al. (33) in their review of 370 biopsy confirmed cases of NSF, suggest that eliminating risk 
factors may substantially reduce the risk of NSF without havi ng to shift to other imaging 
modalities, which may incur risk of radiation and iodinated contrast -induced nephropathy. These 
preventable risk factors include using the lowest dose possible for diagnostic result (limiting 
GBCA dosage to <0.1mmol/kg), avoidi ng non -ionic linear GB CAs in those on dialysis or having  
eGFR < 30mL/min/1.73m2, dialyzing dialysis -dependent patients promptly after exposure, and 
delaying GBCA administration in the setting of acute renal failure particularly when 
proinflammatory conditi ons may exacerbate oxidative stress. The Contrast Media Safety 
Committee of the ESUR (29) also recently published recommendations for NSF -risk mitigation 
where the y outlined the level of evidence and identified classes of recommendations for clinical 
practice. For the pediatric population, no specific evidence based -guidelines exist.  Guidelines for 
adults are typically used.  There have been 10 biopsy -proven pediat ric cases of NSF, but since the 
implementation of guidelines, no new cases in children have been reported (38). To date, no cases 
of NSF have been reported in very young children (38). However, it is known that children younger 
than 2 year s have immature renal function (39). The  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of pre -term 
and term newborns can be as low as 40 ml/min/1.73m2, and it gradually increases to 66 
ml/min/1.73m2 at 2 weeks after birth (39). Due to concerns about nephrogenic systemic fibrosis 
(NSF), The European Society of Urogenital Radiology warns against the use of GBCA, including 
gadof osveset, in children less than 1 year old  (40). Therefore, a significant portion of the 
children in our study will have immature renal function with an unknown, but likely very 
low risk of developing NSF.   
 
[Possible retention in brain and other tissues]  In July 2015, the US FDA issued a safety 
announcement regarding deposits of GBCAs in the globus pallidus and dentate nuclei of patients 
who have undergone multiple GBCA -enhanced MRI (41). The announcement was in response to 
reports of residual gadolinium deposits on non -contrast MRI of patients who had undergone 
multiple GBCA -enhanced MRI exams (42) -- some of whom had normal renal function (19,20) , 
and in those expo sed to ionic linear GBCA (gadopentetate dimeglumine) rather than macrocyclic 
GBCA ( gadoteridol)  (21). In a pictorial essay, Caruso et al. (17) first alluded to this phenomenon 
in 2001, but it was not until recently that the findings wer e publicized by Kanda et al. (18,20,21) ,  
confirmed by Errante et al. (19), and expanded by McDonald et al. (22). Their work is limited to 
patients with intracranial T1 shortening whereas work by others (43–45) suggests that insoluble 
gadolinium (in the form of gadolinium phosphate in bone tissue) may make up another portion of 
residual gadolinium deposit in the body. However, it remains unknown whether these deposits 
have any adverse clinical implications.  The ir findings need confirmatory work, particularly to 
better understand whether certain types of GBCAs are more prone to residual deposition. If future 
research points to significant toxicity of these gadolinium deposits, young children exposed 
to GBCA, incl uding the pediatric CHD population in the Ablavar group of our study, may 
be subject to higher risk due to their longer life expectancy compared to adults.  
 
[Hypersensitivity]   Although the rate of reported cases of NSF has declined, issues relating to 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 21 of 59 
 hypersensitivity remain.  The overall rate of AEs for all GBCAs given at clinical doses (0.1 -
0.2mmol/kg) is estimated to be between 0.07 to 2.4%  (46). As a comparison, the rate of AEs for 
low-osmolality iodinated contrast agents is 0.15% (47) to 0.2%  (46). While hypersensitivity -like 
reactions associated with GBCAs vary from 0.004% to 0.7%, the frequency of serious life -
threatening anaphylactic reactions associated with these agents is exceedingly uncommon (0.001 
to 0.01% (46) vs. 0.04% for nonionic low -osmolality iodinated contrast  (46)). According to 
analysis of data reported in FDA MedWatch by Prince et al. (24), the risk of death associated with 
GBCA administration is less than 1 in a million (‘equivalent to the risk of dying from a chest X -
ray, consuming 0.5L of wine, smoking 1.4 cigarettes, or traveling 86 miles by car’).  In contrast, 
the fatality rate for iodinated contrast is 0.9 per 100,000 injections or 2.1 fatalities per one million 
studies using low -osmolality contrast agents based on FDA data from  1990 -1994  (46). The death 
rate for ionic linear GBCAs is seven times higher than from nonionic linear agents (24) whereas 
the frequency of acute adverse reactions to GBCAs is eight times higher in those with prior 
reactions to GBCAs. For those with prior reactions to GBCAs, the administrat ion of gadobenate 
dimeglumine is contraindicated  (46). Other risk factors for acute hypersensitivity reactions include 
a history of asthma and multiple drug or food allergies. Although there is no cross -reactivity 
between GBCA and iodinated contrast ag ents, the frequency of GBCA -related adverse event is 
2.3-3.7 times higher in those with prior reaction to iodinated contrast (48).  
4.5 What is Feraheme  and what is its potential as an alternative MRI contrast agent?  
Feraheme ® (AMAG Pharmaceuticals, MA)  is a proprietary formulation of the iron supplement 
ferumoxytol . Initially designed as an intravascular MRI contrast agent, Feraheme ® was approved 
as a bolus  intraven ous (IV) iron supplement by the FDA  in 2009 , specifically  for the treatment of 
iron deficiency anemia (IDA) secondary to  chronic kidney disease (CKD).  Each manufacturer -
provided 17 -mL vial  contains 510mg elemental iron (30 mg Fe /mL) and was administered as an 
IV bolus in as little as  17 seconds (1 mL/sec) , a practice recently revised in favor of slow infusion  
over 15 minutes  (49). The therapeutic dose for the treatment of IDA calls for two 510 -mg injections 
given 3 -8 days apart. Compared to other IV iron supplements , Feraheme  was developed to have 
lower free iron rel ease (50), decreased immunologic allergic reaction, and improved safety profile  
(50–52). As an ultr a-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticle, Feraheme  has a 
long intravascular half -life of 14 hours, high r 1 relaxivity, and is incorporated into the 
hematopoietic pathway as supplemental iron once the outer carbohydrate shell is degraded  (53). 
These properties along with its approved therapeutic use in patients with kidney dysfunction  and 
lack of gadolinium  make Feraheme  an attractive alternative to GBCAs for first -pass and steady 
state MRI  (53,54) .  To date, imagers have explored Feraheme  for cardiovascular applications (55–
57), renal transplant imaging  (58), inflammation imaging  (59–61), and cancer imaging  (62–65).   
 
By exploiting the  imaging properties of Feraheme ® appropriately in small children, it is possible 
to acquire images with unprecedented detail, without the need for breath holding.  Our group 
recently developed a technique termed 4 -dimensional MUSIC -MRI , which produce s 4 
dimensional  contrast -enhanced  images of the beating h eart in children, without breath holding (1). 
Additionally, Feraheme ® can overcome issues related to both short -term and long -term 
gadolinium deposition  in soft tissues . In our practice at UCLA, Feraheme® -enhanced  MRI has 
informed clinical decision -making in children with complex and life threatening diseases in ways 
that would otherwise not have been possible.  For this reason, we feel that we have sufficient 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 22 of 59 
 preliminary data to support the prospect of direct benef it (PDB) to patients who undergo MRI with 
Feraheme®  in our investigator -initiated, single center, exploratory, open label clinical trial.   
4.6 Overview  of Non -Clinical Studies  
A review of non -clinical studies is not relevant because Feraheme®  is a medication approved by 
the FDA for IV treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults with chronic renal disease . 
4.7 Overview  of Clinical Studies  
Feraheme®  has been  FDA approved  since 2009  for the treatment of iron deficiency  anemia in 
adult s with  chronic kidney disease ( CKD ).  Based on the manufacturer ’s estimate , there have  been  
more than 1.2 million administrations  since FDA approval  in 2009  (Personal Communication, 
AMAG) . The following sections summarize the safety profile of Feraheme ® as well as Ablavar ®, 
the control agent in this study, for adult/pediatric patients and for therapeutic/diagnostic use.  
4.7.1 Feraheme  as a Therapeutic Agent  
The sa fety and efficacy of Feraheme ® as an I.V. iron replacement therapy agent has been widely 
studied in adult chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with iron deficiency anemia. Table 1 
summarizes findings with regard to safety profile of Feraheme from major pr e- and post -marketing 
studies (>100 patients) in the literature , which point to an anaphylaxis rate ranging from 0 to 0.2% 
at the approved therapeutic dose.

Since the approval of Feraheme in 2009, there have been a number of large patient cohort studies 
(at least 10425 patients in total)  (67–72). The patient cohorts included CKD patients and iron 
deficiency anemia patients without CKD but with a prior history of unsatisfactory oral iron 
therapy.  The AE data reported in these post -marketing studies are summarized in Table 2. It should

4.7.2 Feraheme  as a Diagnostic MRI Contrast Agent  
Data in Literature:  There is less published safety information related to use of Feraheme as a 
diagnostic agent. Table 3 summarizes the AE and SAE rates associated with diagnostic Feraheme 
administration in adults and ch ildren  based on our literature search . To the knowledge of the 
Investigators, no clinically significant hypotension, hypersensitivity/anaphylactoid r eactions, 
syncopy, dyspnea , loss of consciousness  or fatalities have  been reported so far that is associate d 
with Feraheme administration as an MRI contrast agent .

The Feraheme ® doses used in the literature as a diagnostic contrast agent ranged from 3 mg /kg 
to 7 mg/kg  (58,73 –83). For imaging purposes at our institution, we have used 4 mg/kg in 208 
patient studies, which is in line with the dose used in the majority of Feraheme ®-enhanced MRI  
publications  shown in Table 3 . Therefore, we will continue using 4mg/kg in the current study, for 
both Part I and Part II studies , when applicable .  
 
UCLA Institutional Experience in Children:  Based on data in the literature and communications 
with other centers in the U.S. and Europe, including UCLA , there have b een approximately 2,000 
studies (both clinical and research) using Feraheme  as a contrast agent. To our best knowledge, so 
far there have been no reports of serious or life threatening AEs  associated with using Feraheme ® 
as an imaging agent in children.  In the therapeutic use of Feraheme, the two life-threatening safety 
concerns with Feraheme® in the overall experience with the product have been hypotension and 
hypersensitivity reactions. To date, 79 unique children  with CKD or CHD have undergone 
Feraheme® enhanced MRI under anesthesia at UCLA , all without any AEs. We also 
retrospectively identified 34 pediatric patients who underwent clinically -indicated Ablavar ®-
enhanced MRI  under general anesthesia  and compared the he modynamic parameters (heart rate,

 systolic and diastolic blood pressure ), oxygenation (pulse oximetry ) and ventilation ( end-tidal 
CO 2) between a subset of the Feraheme group (50 consecutive children  with complete anesthesia 
records ) and the Ablavar group ( 34 children  with complete anesthesia records ), as well as between 
different time points (pre -injection, immediately post -injection, 30 min post -injection and >1 hr 
post-injection) within each group. No statistically significant change in intra-group tempor al 
variations of mean heart rate, blood pressure, oxygenation, or ventilation was observed 
immediately pre -injection, immediately post -, 30 minutes post, and >1 hour post -injection for both 
the Feraheme ® group and the Ablavar ® group (Figures 1&2, one -way A NOVA, p>0.05 ). There 
was no statistical  difference in these parameters between the two groups  using t -test, Wilcoxon, or 
ANOVA methods .

protocol to infuse the dilute  Feraheme over 5 -10 minutes in the pediatric CHD patients.  
4.7.3 Comparison of Feraheme ® vs. Ablavar ® Safety  
According to the Feraheme ® package label from the FDA, its anaphylactic/hypersensitivity rate 
is approximately 0.2% (3 out of 1726 administ rations of the therapy dose in pre -marketing  clinical 
trials) and hypotension was reported in 33 out of 1726 subjects, including 3 severe hypot ensive 
reactions. According to the ferumoxytol  (Rienso®) package from the  European Medicines Agency  
(EMA ), the rate of serious hypersensitivity and hypotension reactions combined is 0.2% (3 out of 
1562 subjects), and out of the 3 serious reactions, 1 (<0.1 %) was characterized as an anaphylactoid 
reaction. In a more recent study of 8666 CKD  patients who underwent Feraheme ® administration, 
two patients (0.02%) experienced anaphylactoid reactions  (68). The aggregate rate of anaphylaxis 
in post -marketing trials is 0.03%  (See Tab le 2), lower than that reported on package inserts, which 
was based on pre -marketing clinical trials. As a comparison, Ablavar  (Ablavar ®), which is a 
widely used gadolinium based MRI contrast agent, has an anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction  rate 
of 0.1%  (2 out of 1676 subjects according to its label from the FDA). However , Ablavar ®, because 
it is a gadolinium based contrast agent, is included in the group of agents listed by the FDA as 
having a possible association with NSF in patients with  insufficient re nal function . Also, Ablavar  
is associated with cardiac electrical conduction effects, most specifically prolongation of the QT 
interval. This has caused some institutions to shy away from including it in their drug formulary. 
Furthermore, gadolinium is a f oreign element and is not a natural constituent of biological systems. 
This concern is underscored by the recent discovery of gadolinium deposits in patients ’ brains  after 
repeated exposure to GBCA (17–22), even those with normal renal function. Iron, on the other 
hand, is an essential element for life and iron deficiency is associated with a plethora of potentially 
serious health consequences . Despite these objective facts, Feraheme ®, perhaps by inferential 
association with larger iron particles such as ferumoxides (Feridex®) which have been commonly 
associated with  hypersensitivity and back pain, may be perceived as higher risk  by the general 
community than gadolinium -based agents, which are generally deemed to have a very good safety 
profile. Ta ble 5 summarizes the adverse reaction rates of Feraheme ® (full therapeutic dose) and 
Ablavar ® (0.03 mmol/kg) from their respective most recent FDA/EMA product labeling .

5 STUDY RATIONALE  
In children with congenital heart disease (CHD) , echocardiography is universally regarded as the 
primary diagnostic imaging modality. When echocardiography is inconclusive, MRI is the 
preferred second line imaging modality due to the absence  of ionizing radiation and the ability to 
incorporate functional  as well as  anatomic  information. The current MRI contrast agents are based 
on chelates of the rare earth element, gadolinium (Gd) . Feraheme®  (AMAG Pharmaceuticals) is 
a proprietary formulation of Feraheme , an ultra -small, super -paramagnetic iron oxide (US PIO) 
nanoparticle , approved by the FDA as an intravenous  iron therapy  for anemia i n adult chronic 
kidney disease. Compared to  GBCAs , Feraheme  exhibits a unique combination of high signal 
potency (r1 relaxivity) and a long intravascular residence time , whic h make it very powerful for 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 29 of 59 
 MR imaging of pediatric CHD.  By exploiting these  unique imaging propert ies of Feraheme  
appropriately , it is possible to acquire images with unprecedented detail, without the need for 
breath holding , both of which are crucial in  tiny babies .  Our group recently developed a technique 
termed 4 -dimensional MUSIC -MRI  (MUltiphase Steady state Imaging with Contrast)  (1), which 
leverages the specific imaging properties of Feraheme  to produce 4 dimensional images of the 
beating heart in children, during uninterrupted ventilation . By lifting  the requirement for breath 
holding , it becomes possible to prolong the image acquisition time sufficient to capture multiple 
phases of the cardiac cycle with very high spatial resolution and with high contrast to noise ratio 
(CNR). By capturing a true, isotropic 3 -dimensional set of images over multipl e phases of the 
cardiac cycle, it becomes trivial  to reconstruct 2 -dimensional slices of the beating heart in any 
arbitrary plane. Effectively, this is equivalent to acquiring an infinite set of individual slices in 
multiple orientations, analogous to 2 -dimensional cine MRI slices or 2 -dimensional planes on 
echocardiography. However, in the case of 2 -dimensional cardiac cine and echocardiography, the 
individual planes must be specified at the time of the study. This would be prohibitively time 
consuming , if not geometrically impossible  and if not acquired  during the original scan , such slices  
cannot be reconstructed af ter the fact  even if they would help guide surgical decision -making . 
With MUSIC -MRI , any arbitrary slice can be interrogated after the fact an d forever, providing a 
permanent repository for interrogation of any cardiac structure should this become clinically 
relevant in a way that was not originally anticipated . Already in our practice at UCLA, Feraheme  
MRI has informed clinical decision -making in complex diseases and critically ill children in ways 
that would not otherwise have been possible , even invasively. For example, d ecisions about 
whether to perform bi -ventricular vs . single ventricle repair in complex CHD  and about the extent 
and nature of thrombosis  and infection have been based soundly on information provided by the 
unique combination of Feraheme®  and techniques developed at U CLA to exploit its properties. 
Feraheme®  has already proved to be invaluable in these patients  at our institutio n. We have 
accumulated sufficient preliminary evidence in our daily clinical practice (see Appendix ) to 
support the prospect of direct benefit (PDB) in children undergoing Feraheme® -enhanced MRI.   
 
Our current MUSIC -MRI  technique uses the ventilator circuit air -pressure signal for respiratory 
motion gating (i.e. ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI ). Therefore, the technique is currently only 
applicable to patients who are under anesthesia/sedation with endotracheal intubation . Our long -
term goal is to enable free -breathing MUSIC -MRI  scans in children who may not require 
anesthesia or sedation  for MRI. In these cases, an alternative respiratory motion gating strategy 
will need to be developed and validated, and the image acquisitio n time will need to be further 
shortened to ensure high quality studies in these patients. Therefore, in Part II of our study, we will 
develop such an MRI pulse sequence using a respiratory motion self -gating technique and 
compressed sensing image reconstr uction (self -gated MUSIC -MRI ) and we will test the hypothesis 
that the self -gated MUSIC -MRI  pulse sequence is non -inferior to the ventilator -gated MUSIC -
MRI  in a cohort of children with CHD.  
5.1 Benefit  to Risk  Assessment  
Feraheme  infusion  is associated with risks , which include  acute  anaphylactoid reactions  and 
hypotension, as well as other types of less severe adverse events such as rash, nausea and vomiting. 
The investigators are fully aware of the potential risks of Feraheme  infusion  and the following is 
our plan to mitigate  these  risks. As summarized in our Overview of Clinical Studies in Section 4.5, 
Feraheme ® and the control contrast agent, Ablav ar®, have a similar  and small  risk of 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 30 of 59 
 hypersensitivity/anaphylactoid r eactions in pre -marketing clinical trials and the post -marketing  
data of Feraheme ® safety point to a lower reported incidence  of anaphylaxis  than pre -marketing 
data. Furthermore, the ele mental iron in its core is indispensible for normal biosynthesis and 
energy metabolism. Iron deficiency is the most widespread disorder in the world and its prevalence 
in children is 3 -7% in the U.S. (84). It has been shown that the majority of pediatric CHD patients 
do not meet the recommendations for iron uptake (85). In normal neonates, body iron stores reach 
a nadir at about six months of age and in order to meet the demands of rapid growth  must be 
appropriately supplemented by a diet rich in iron, such as formula. In sick neonates, body iron 
stores are frequently low from birth and these patients often require iron supplements (85). In these 
patients, it see ms likely that Feraheme ® may offer a nutritional iron boost, over and above its 
imaging applications. Therefore, f or the pediatric CHD patient population in this study, who will 
need a high quality cardiovascular MRI exam in order to inform  surgical decisi on-making , the 
Investigators feel the potential benefit for these children greatly outweighs the potential 
incremental risks  associated with participating in this study , especially given the recent reports of 
gadolinium deposits in the brain tissue after r epeated GBCA exposure  (17–22).  
 
5.2 Monitoring of Adverse Events after Feraheme®  Administratio n 
A careful interview with the patient’s legal guardians will be conducted before each study. The 
pediatric CHD patients will undergo clinical screening procedures for exclusion criteria. In 
children examined under anesthesia or sedation for MRI at UCLA, the  full spectrum of anesthetic 
and sedative agents is routinely available, as is the full spectrum of pharmacological agents 
required to treat anaphylactic or  other adverse drug reactions. Due to the specific concerns about 
acute AEs, including hypersensitiv ity and anaphylactic reactions, awareness of the possibility of 
such occurrence will be appropriately emphasized among the anesthesiology and NICU staff . The 
following safety strategies are in place at UCLA to mitigate any risks associated with infusion of  
Feraheme  in our pediatric patients with CHD:  
1) All patients will be screened for contraindications to Feraheme  administration, including a 
history of allergy to intravenous iron products and iron overload.  
2) Prior to Feraheme  infusion, all patients will be se dated (or anesthetized), intubated and 
ventilated such that, in the case of a serious AE, there will already be in place full airway 
protection and support of respiration.  Anesthesia is routinely employed  in most centers for 
infants and young children unde rgoing cardiac MRI who cannot reliably follow verbal 
instructions during imaging.  
3) Continuous patient monitoring and recording of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, 
oxygen saturation and ECG) before, during and for at least 30 minutes following Ferah eme 
infusion will be provided by expert and specialized staff, including pediatric 
anesthesiologists and /or staff from the UCLA Neonatal or Pediatric Intensive Care Units.  
These vital signs data will be  uploaded to the UCLA electronic medical record syst em. In 
the case of a clinically urgent or life -threatening AE, changes in vital signs will be 
recognized immediately and appropriate treatment initiated.  
4) The dose of Feraheme  will be up to 4 mg /kg (approximately half the single therapy dose), 
diluted wit h saline and infused slowly ( approximately over 10 minutes) . Our infusion rate 
will be consistent with latest FDA guidelines on a mg/kg/sec basis.   
 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 31 of 59 
 Consistent with institutional clinical practice at UCLA  and other Centers of Excellence in pediatric 
cardiovascular MRI , anesthesia in the pediatric CHD patients will be performed by speciali zed 
pediatric anesthesiologists regardless of contrast agent used ( Feraheme ® vs. Ablavar ®) with 
continuous monitoring of  heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, end tidal CO2, and, where 
appropriate, anesthetic gas levels (such as sevofluorane). All of the children in our study will have 
protected airways and mechanical ventilatory support from the start of the procedur e to the end .  
Clinically urgent and life -threatening  adverse reactions to any agent may include laryngeal edema 
and bronchospasm, where prior endotracheal intubation may be lifesaving.  Should other events 
occur involving changes in heart rate, heart rhyt hm and /or blood pressure, the anesthesiologist 
can focus his / her attention on the appropriate use of chronotropic or inotropic agents, intravenous 
fluids and /or vasoactive drugs, without having to secure the airway.  All patient physiological 
monitorin g data are, and will continue to be, digitized and transferred in real time to the electronic 
patient medical record, where they are stored permanently and retrievably. Relevant abstractions 
from these and other patient safety data (protected health inform ation removed) will be included 
in our DMC , IRB and IND adverse event reports.   
6 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
1. To compare the diagnostic efficacy  of Ablavar ®-based MUSIC -MRI  with Feraheme ®-based 
MUSIC -MRI  in pediatric patients with CHD . (Study Part I)  
2. To determine the diagnostic efficacy  of an accelerated self-gated MUSIC -MRI  cardiovascular 
MRI technique for pediatric patients with CHD , which  ultimately may not  require sedation or 
general anesthesia . (Study Part II)  
3. To summarize the safety of Feraheme®  and Ablavar®  as an MRI contrast agent in pediatric 
patients with CHD . 
7 STUDY  DESIGN  
7.1 Study Overview  
This is a n exploratory, investigator -initiated,  prospective, open label, case -control,  single center , 
phase IV  study  that will examine the diagnostic effectiveness of Feraheme®  as an MRI contrast 
agent in pediatric patients with CHD . A total of 120 patients  with suspected or known CHD (age 
newborn to 6 years ) of all ethnicities, females and males,  will be enrolled.  Total duration of subject 
participation  in the imaging study  will be approximately 1.5 hours .  In general, we expect the 
pediatric MRI scans to take no more than about 60  minutes once the scan begin s. We will also 
follow up the children for up to 60 days.  Total duration of the study is expected to be 5 years . Our 
study has two parts:  
1) Part I is a comparison study b etween Feraheme ®-enhanced MRI and  Ablavar ®-enhanced 
MRI.  The goal of Part I is to compare the diagnostic efficacy  of these two contrast agents for 
pediatric CHD  using our validated technique MUSIC -MRI  (1). We hypothesize that Feraheme ® 
provides superior diagnostic effectiveness than Abla var® for these patients . The duration of Part 
I is expected to be 3 years.  
2) Part II is expected to commence after the statistical significance of the primary endpoint of 
Part I is confirmed and the goal is to determine the diagnostic efficacy  of an MRI p ulse sequence 
(self-gated MUSIC -MRI ), which will leverage advanced image reconstruction techniques and

Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 32 of 59 
 respiratory motion compensation strategies.  Self-gated MUSIC -MRI  may ultimately  enable high -
quality free -breathing cardiovascular MRI for pediatric CHD patients who are able to undergo 
imaging without sedation or general anesthesia (i.e. children >6 years old who can consistently 
follow verbal instructions during scanning).  The durat ion of Part II is expected to be 2 years.  
7.2 Study Design Part I: diagnostic efficacy  of Feraheme vs . Ablavar   
For Part I of our study, t he legal guardian(s) of all consecutive pediatric patients with suspected or 
known CHD referred for cardiovascular MRI wil l be given the option of having their child 
undergoing an Ablavar® -enhanced MRI or a Feraheme® -enhanced MRI , after the potential 
benefits and risks of both agents are clearly explained and their questions addressed . The risks and 
benefits of using each of these agents will be verbally discussed with the patients’ legal guardians  
and referring card iologists or cardiac surgeons. A copy of the written IRB -approved informed 
consent will be provided . Because Feraheme ®-based imaging is in use at several pediatric 
specialty centers, including UCLA whereby Feraheme is used more frequently than GBCA -based 
imaging for children in our study age -group, in the current state of professional equipoise, we 
judge it appropriate to  allow parents to participate in the choice of agent (see Section 11.1.1 for 
detailed justification). Those choosing to undergo an Ablavar® -enhanced MRI will be considered 
the “control” group  while those choosing to undergo a Feraheme® -enhanced MRI will  be 
considered enrolled in the “test” group . We plan to recruit 40 patients  for test group and 40 patients 
for the control group  with consideration of approximately 10% missing or unusable image quality . 
To avoid performing a study with larger -than-necessary enrollment, the Investigators will request 
an interim analysis at 50% enrollment for both groups. If statistical  analyses, either as part of 
interim analyses  requested by the Investigators, or after full enrollment, shows statistically 
significant primary endpoint comparison, we will close Part I enrollment and begin  Part II 
enrollment  using the superior agent identified in Part I. If statistical significance is not reached for 
the primary endpoint  during interim analyses, the patient enrollment for both te st and control 
groups will continue until full enrollment, at which time another final statistical analyses will be 
performed with p<0.025 considered statistically significant. If statistical significance is not 
reached at full enrollment, we will seek advice from the DMC regarding Part II of the study, 
including contrast agent to be used.   
 
See Section 11.1.1 for justification for involving the patient’s parents in patient group  assignment.  
 
7.3 Study Design  Part II: diagnostic efficacy  of ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  vs. self-
gated MUSIC -MRI  
The Part II study will commence after statistical significance of the primary endpoint of Part I is 
confirmed. The overall goal of Part II is to develop and validate a more advanced MUSIC -MRI  
pulse sequence that incorpo rates image acceleration and compressed sensing reconstruction 
techniques as well as respiratory motion self -gating methods. Our current MUSIC -MRI  pulse 
sequence is designed for young patients (newborn to 6 years old) who undergo cardiovascular MRI 
under g eneral anesthesia or sedation per our institutional standard practice. The ventilator air 
pressure signal is currently used as a respiratory motion gating signal in our ventilator -gated 
MUSIC -MRI  pulse sequence. For old er children with CHD who can reliably  follow verbal 
instructions during the MRI examination, undergoing sedation or anesthesia for the purpose of 
MRI would not be justifiable. Therefore, a free -breathing self -gated MUSIC -MRI  pulse sequence 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 33 of 59 
 that is capable of acquiring high -quality images of t he heart and blood vessels of these patients 
without anesthesia /sedation or the need for a ventilator gating signal would be highly desirable. 
To achieve this goal, the investigators plan to first validate such a self -gated MUSIC -MRI  
technique against the existing ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  technique in patients undergoing MRI 
under anesthesia  or sedation, a similar setup as Par t I. The reasons for testing the new pulse 
sequence in younger patients under anesthesia/sedation rather than in older patients without 
anesthesia are two fold: 1)  This strategy provides a means for the investigators to verify the 
diagnostic effectiveness of the self -gated MUSIC -MRI  sequence against  the “gold -standard’ 
ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  sequence , which would not be possible in spontaneously breathing 
patients . 2) Even in patients under anesthesia with mechanical ventilation,  potential benefits of 
self-gated MUSIC -MRI  include shorter acquisition time ( 8-10 min for current MUSIC -MRI  vs. 
approximately 4-5 min for the accelerated self -gated MUSIC -MRI ) and improved respiratory 
motion gating,  as the self-gating signal is a more direct measurement of diaph ragmatic  motion than 
the ventilator circuit air -pressure signal. Therefore, in the Part II study, we will recruit 40 patients 
who provide informed consent into the contrast  agent group (either  Feraheme ® or Ablavar ®) 
identified in Part I of the study. In each patient, the current ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  pulse 
sequence and the to -be-developed self -gated MUSIC -MRI  pulse sequence will be performed 
sequentially in a randomized order  by flipping a coin . Other than the added self -gated MUSIC -
MRI  pulse sequence and target enrollment differences, all other aspects of study design for Part II, 
including patient safety monitoring and safety data recording, will be the same as Part I. The 
additional self -gated MUSIC -MRI pulse  sequence will require approximately 5 minutes to 
perform. At the end of Part II study, we will perform statistical analyses specified in Section 18 to 
confirm the diagnostic efficacy  of the self -gated MUSIC -MRI  pulse sequence.   
If no statistical significa nt difference for the primary endpoint was found in Part I, we will seek 
advice from the DMC regarding whether or not to start Part II of the study . If the DMC decides in 
favor of pursuing Part II of the study, they will also comment on  which contrast agen t to be used. 
In offering advice for the choice of agent in Part II, the Investigators will ask the DMC to take the 
following factors into consideration :  
1. Numerical superiority of one agent in Part I, even if statistical significance cannot be 
reached.  
2. Superiority of one agent for the secondary endpoints in Part I.  
3. Differences in safety information observed during Part I, if any, and differences in safety 
based on the current literature at the end of Part I study, including risks of life -threatening 
reactions, risks to immature kidneys in the participants, potential long -term risks of 
gadolinium deposit in neurological tissues.

9 SUBJECT  SELECTION  
9.1 Study  Population  
Pediatric patients of all ethnicities, age newborn to 6 years , of either gender with known or 
suspected CHD will be recruited. This specific age population has been chosen becau se our 
preliminary experience s suggest that the PDB  is greatest in the smallest and sickest children. 
Furthermore, all patients of ages < 6 years undergoing cardiac MR imaging are routinely examined 
under anesthesia with controlled ventilation  independently  of our study  and under the direct and 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 35 of 59 
 continuous observation of a  pediatric anesthesiologist or neonatologist . These elements minimize 
the relative risk  of Feraheme ® administration by enabling  airway protection and the ability to 
perform non -breath -held diagnostic studies in potentially fragile patients.  Our study popul ation 
will include patients with any types of CHD who are clinically referred to cardiovascular MRI; 
however, we expect our patient recruitment to be concentrated in more complex forms of CHD, 
such as Tetralogy of Fallot, because these are the patients tha t typically have inadequate 
echocardiographic exams and are referred for MRI. We do not expect our study population to have 
eGFR<40  mL/min/1.73m2, although renal insufficiency is an exclusion criteria for the Ablavar ® 
group of Part I study.  
9.2 Inclusion  Criteria  
1. Male or female pediatric patients (age newborn to 6 years ) of all ethnicities  with known or 
suspected CHD  with insufficient echocardiographic exams and are referred for cardiovascular 
MRI  for further evaluation o f cardiac anatomy and function .  
2. Written informed consent obtained from subject’s legal representative/guardian(s) and ability 
for subject to comply with the requirements of the study . 
9.3 Exclusion  Criteria   
1. Standard clinical contraindication to MRI, includin g subjects with cochlear implants and  
implanted cardiac devices  
2. Subjects with past or current diagnosis of iron overload due to hereditary 
hemochromatosis or other causes  (for subjects receiving Feraheme ® injection only) . 
3. Subjects with known hypersensitivity or allergy to iron oxide particles . 
4. Subject s with renal insufficiency  defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 
40 mL/min/1.73m2  (for subjects receiving Ablavar ® injection only ). 
5. Subjects who are critically ill at the time of MRI and for whom the period of general 
anesthesia and separation from the critical care nursery or intensive care unit poses added 
risk as de emed by referring cardiologists, cardiac surgeons  or the managing radiologist  
(for Part II only).  
6. Other medical conditions, in the judgment of the clinician investigator, that would increase 
the risks to the child related to participation in the study.

 11 STUDY TREATMENTS  
11.1 Method of Assigning  Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Refer to Section 7. 2 for patient group assignment in Part I  of the study.   For Part II of the study, 
all subjects will undergo  the ventilator -gated  MUSIC -MRI  and self-gated MUSIC -MRI  in one 
imaging session  in a randomized order  by flipping a coin .  
 
11.1.1   Justification for Parents  Participation in Patient Group Assignment  
We plan to allow parents to participate in the decision about treatment assignment in  Part I of  this 
open -label, evaluator -blinded study. Feraheme -based imaging is in use at  several pediatric 
specialty centers, in cluding UCLA whereby Feraheme is  used more frequently  than GBCA -based 
imaging for children i n our  study age -group. In the current state of professional equipoise, we 
judge it appropriate to allow parents to participate in the choice of agent. There is no a priori  
reason to expect MRI image quality, ventricular or aortic wall definition, or the risks of 
anaphylaxis or other important AEs to be influenced by parental preferences; thus the 
generalizability of our scientific conclusions will not be diminished b y allowing parents to 
influence the treatment assignment for their children. Recruitment of children in clinical studies is 
a challenging process. Based on our clinical investigative experience in the particular patient 
population at UCLA, many parents and /or legal guardians are more willing to participate in a study 
without randomization of treatment than one that required randomization of the child’s treatment. 
We expect this route of recruitment will facilitate recruitment and successful completion of th e 
study.  In scenarios where the patient’s legal guardians defer and ask the managing clinician to 
make ‘the best choice’, the decision will be based on the apparent needs of the trial at the time and 
the patient will be assigned the group that is under -enrolled with reference to the target enrollment. 
If our patient group assignment method results in a severely distorted imbalance (e.g. nearly all 
parents elect either Feraheme or Ablavar), the DMC  will be convened and asked to advise on a 
corrective measur e, which may include changing the patient group allocation method .  
 
11.2 Blinding  
For Part I of the trial, the image readers  will be blinded to the patient’s information and the contrast 
agent used.  For Part II of the trial, the image reviewers will be blinded to the te chniques used.  In 
both cases (Part I and Part II) , scores for image quality, sharpness  and CNR measurements  will 
remain blinded to the managing clinician and the I nvestigators and only the study  statistician will 
be able to pair the contrast agent assignment /score (for Part I) and technique assignment /score 
(for Part II).   
11.3 Formulation  of Test and Control Produc ts 
Formulation of Test Product  
Feraheme  (Feraheme® ) is an FDA approved drug  manufactured by  AMAG Pharmaceuticals for 
I.V. administration as an iron supplement for iron deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease. It 
is an aqueous colloidal product that is formulated with mannitol. It is a black to reddish brown 
liquid, and is provided in single u se vials containing 510 mg of elemental iron. Each mL of the

Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 37 of 59 
 and has low bleomycin -detectable iron. The formulation is isotonic with an osmolality of 270 -330 
mOs m/kg. The product contains no preservatives, and has a pH of 6 to 8.    
Formulation of Control Product  
Ablavar® is an FDA approved MRI contrast agent for evaluation of aortoiliac occlusive disease 
in adults with known or suspected peripheral vascular diseas e. Ablavar is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, 
formulation of stable gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (GdDTPA) chelate derivative 
with a diphenylcyclohexylphosphate group. Each mL of Ablavar contains 244 mg of gadofosveset 
trisodium (0.25 mmol), 0.268  mg of fosveset, and water for injection. It contains no preservative 
and the solution pH ranges between 6.5 and 8.0.  Gadofosveset trisodium is chemically trisodium -
{(2-(R)-[(4,4 -diphenylcyclohexyl) phosphonooxymethyl] -
diethylenetriaminepentaacetato)(aquo)  gadolinium(III),  with a molecular weight of 975.88 
g/mol, and an empirical formula of C 33H40GdN 3Na3O15P.  
Packaging and Labeling  
Feraheme® and Ablavar used in this study will be commercial product and will be in the 
commercial primary container/closure sy stem.   Investigational labels, with the required caution 
statement, “Caution -new drug limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use” will be used to over -
label individual vials of commercial product by the UCLA pharmacy before supplying to the 
investigator  for the clinical study .  
Dosage/Dosage Regimen  
Feraheme  will be infused  intravenously  at a dose level of 4 mg of iron per kg of body weight.  
Ablavar is administered by an int ravenous bolus at a dose of 0.0 3 mmol/kg body weight over a 
period of time up to 30 seconds followed by a normal saline flush.

 12 STUDY PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES  
Prior to co nducting any study -related activities, written informed consent and the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be signed and dated by the subject 
or subject’s legal representative /guardian(s) .   
12.1 Clinical Assessments  
Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medication and concurrent therapies will be documented at the date of study  MRI. 
Dose, route, unit frequency of administration, and indication for administration and dates of 
medication will be captured.  
Demographics   
Demographic information (date of birth, gender, race) will be recorded at Screening.  
Medical History  
Relevant medical history, including history of current disease, other pertinent respiratory history, 
and information regarding underlying diseases will be recorded at Screening . 
Physical Examination  
N/A 
Vital Signs  / Oximetry / Ventilatory Parameters  
Conti nuous heart rate, b lood pressure, ECG , pulse oximetry, and end tidal CO 2 will be monitored  
for the duration  of the MRI study and until the subject is recovered or returned to the Intensive 
Care facility, or for 30 minutes after the infusion, whichever is longer.  
Adverse Events  
Information regarding occurrence of  acute  adverse events will be captured throughout  the study. 
Duration (start and stop dates and times), severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relation to study 
drug will be recorded on the case report form (CRF).  Each patient will be followed up  via a review 
of medical record at 60 days after MRI study to capture any additional AEs.   
12.2 MRI Procedures   
12.2.1  Patient Preparation and Setup  
All patients will undergo MRI on an FDA approved, clinical 18 -channel Siemens 3.0T Magnetom 
TIM Trio scanner, and running  version B 17 software.  The appropriate RF receiver coil  
configuration will be chosen depending on patient size; for example neonates may be studied using 
a 16 element adult knee coil, infants using an adult head -neck coil combination and older children 
using surface flex coils or a body array coil . Fixed (spine) coil elements in the patient table may 
be used in combination with any of the other coils (except the knee coil).   
 
Prior to Feraheme or Ablavar infusion, all patients will be asleep, intubated and ventilated such 
that, in the case of a clinically urgent or life -threatening AE, there will already be in place full 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 39 of 59 
 airway protection, physiological monitoring and support of respiration. Consistent with 
institutional clinical practice at UCLA, anesthesia in the pediatric CHD patients will be pe rformed 
by speciali zed pediatric anesthesiologists regardless of contrast agent used (Feraheme vs. Ablavar) 
with continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, end tidal CO 2, and, where 
appropriate, anesthetic gas levels (such as sevo fluorane). In the case of a SAE, changes in vital 
signs will be recognized immediately and appropriate treatment initiated. All of the children in our 
study will have protected airways and mechanical ventilatory support from the start of the 
procedure  to the end .  Serious adverse reactions to any agent may include laryngeal edema and 
bronchospasm, where prior endotracheal  intubation may be lifesaving. Should other events occur 
involving changes in heart rate, heart rhythm and /or blood pressure, the anesthe siologist can focus 
his / her attention on the appropriate use of chronotropic or inotropic agents, intravenous fluids 
and /or vasoactive drugs, without having to secure the airway .  All patient physiological 
monitoring data are, and will continue to be, d igitized and transferred in real time to the electronic 
patient medical record, where they are stored permanently and retrievably. Relevant abstractions 
from these and other patient safety data (protected health information removed) will be included 
in our  DMC , IRB and IND adverse event reports.   
 
Once asleep and intubated, patients will be positioned in the appropriate receiver coils and 
monitored with ECG and with MRI compatible pulse oximetry and non -invasive blood pressure 
measurement (InVivo Medical So lutions , Inc. ). The vital signs monitoring equipment will all be 
FDA approved devices. The end -tidal CO 2 line will be interfaced via a three way plastic stop -cock 
to the respiratory port of the MRI physiological monitoring unit. In this way, the respirator y signal 
is split so as to provide both uninterrupted end -tidal CO 2 monitoring and airway pressure signal.  
The airway pressure trace is available for use as a respiratory gating signal to compensate for 
respiratory motion artifact without interrupting pat ient ventilation  (1).  
 
12.2.2  Contrast Agent Dose and Injection Rate  
12.2.2.1 Feraheme ® Dose and Injection Rate  
Once patients are positioned and outfitted with receiver coils, venous access lines and 
physiological monitoring sensors, dilute Feraheme ® will be administered by slow intravenous 
infusion to a total dose of 4 mg /kg (1,83) . According to the recent FDA warning issued in March 
2015, the entire therapeutic dose (510mg of Fe) of Feraheme should be injected as a slow infusion 
over 15 min or longer. For an average adult of 75kg body weight, 510 mg corresponds to 7 mg /kg 
and a 15 min infusion time corresponds to an infusion rate of 0.45 mg /kg.min. We will infuse 4 
mg/kg of Feraheme which, at the rate suggested by the FDA, would require 8 m in 30 sec to infuse. 
We will round this time up to 10 minutes for practicality and t o ensure we do not exceed the 
recommended rate. The Feraheme will be diluted before injection for safety as well as practical 
reasons. The FDA warning dated March 2015 requires that Feraheme not to be injected without 
dilution to minimize risks of acute ad verse reactions. The weight of patients in our study may range 
from 1kg (neonate) to 20 kg (6 year old).  For neonates or small infants, the absolute volume of 
Feraheme to be used may be < 0.5 ml, and without significant dilution, controlling infusion of t his 
volume over 10 minutes would be technically impractical. The factor by which the Feraheme can 
be safely diluted will also be influenced by the patient’s physiological status. Patients with cardiac 
failure, a fixed cardiac output or with renal impairmen t may not tolerate a fluid challenge well.   
 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 40 of 59 
 For precise calibration of dose and delivery rate in the study group, the following considerations 
apply:  
 
The stock formulation of Feraheme® is an isosmolar solution containing 30 mg elemental iron 
equivalent per ml. Therefore, 4 mg of iron is contained in 0.13 ml of undiluted Feraheme®.  Total 
administered volume of undiluted Feraheme® is therefore 0.1333 ml /kg * weight in kg.  Due to 
the requirement to infuse over several minutes, the stock formulation will be diluted by a factor of 
6-30 with normal saline and infused over 10 minutes (600 secs).  This rate corresponds to an 18 
minute infusion period for a 500 mg dose of iron in a 70 kg adult and is therefore within the 15 
minute infusion guideline set forth b y the FDA in March, 2015.  
 
12.2.2.2 Ablavar Dose and Injection Rate  
Each patient in the Ablavar group of our study will receive 0.03 mmol/kg of Ablavar, the FDA 
approved dose for MR angiography. The Ablavar will be diluted up to 8 fold and injected over 
15-20 seconds  (86). These d ose and injection rates are consistent with our current institutional 
standard practice . 
12.2.3  MRI Scanning Procedures  
As for all patients, the MRI system will perform automatic adjustment procedures to optimize the 
homogeneity of the magnetic field, customized to the individual patient.  It will also perform 
standard RF frequency adjustment of the transmitter RF field and calibration of the receiver coil 
elements.  All parameters for RF dose (SAR or specific absorption rate) and gradient switching 
rates will be within FDA approved limits and monitored continuously by permanent and 
immutable software and hardware watchdogs (Siemens product specifications on file at FDA).  
 
With the patient  being ventilated continuously, the following MRI pulse sequences will be 
performed:  
 
For Study Part I, each patient (regardless of test or control group assignment) will undergo MRI 
using the following MRI pulse sequences: 1) Conventional 2D cine imaging for cardiac function 
assessment and phase -contrast MRI for flow quantification in imaging planes specified by a 
radiologist or cardiologist at the point of delivery, per our institutional standard practice regardless 
of our research protocol. These image a cquisitions are necessary to ensure that each patient will 
get a diagnostic MRI study regardless the outcome of our research and will only be performed 
when the patient is considered by the supervising anesthesiologist to be stable for ventilator -
controlle d breath -hold maneuvers; 2) The 3D cine ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  MRI, based on 
which the Feraheme vs. Ablavar comparison will be performed.  
 
For Study Part II, each patient will undergo the same MRI pulse sequence as Part I of our study. 
In addition, ea ch patient will undergo the to -be-developed self -gated MUSIC -MRI  MRI and the 
order of the ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  and the self -gated MUSIC -MRI  will be randomized. 
The self -gated MUSIC -MRI  pulse sequence will require an additional 5 min of scan time and 
anesthesia time without breath holding, which the investigators feel does not add significant 
additional risk to the patient.

14 ADVERSE  EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
14.1 Adverse  Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the  treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 42 of 59 
 abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration 
of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational p roduct.   
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during each 
subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be 
recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will  be described by duration (start and stop dates 
and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
14.1.1  AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities 
judged to be clinically significant. If the experience is not covered in the criteria, the guidelines 
shown in Table 6 below sh ould be used to grade severity.  It should be p ointed out that the term 
“severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table 6.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no 
medical intervention or therapy required. The subject may be 
aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospitalizations possible.  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as 
it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that 
hypothetically might hav e caused death if it were more severe.  
 
14.1.2  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the guidelines 
in Table 7 . 
Table 7.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a re asonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by 
stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug; and that is not explained by any 
other reasonable hypothe sis. 
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
drug; that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug; and 
that is unlikely to be explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state or by other interventions.  
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 43 of 59 
 Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected 
drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the 
study drug.  
14.2 Serious Adverse  Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed.

15 DISCONTINUATION  AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
15.1 Early Discontinuation  
A subject may be discontinued from study treatment at any time if the subject ’s leg al guardians or 
the Investigators feel  that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  The following is a list 
of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation:  
• Subject withdrawal of consent  
• Subject is not compliant with study procedur es 
• Adverse event that in the opinion of the investigator would be in the best interest of the subject 
to discontinue study treatment  
• Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 44 of 59 
 • Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor request for early termination of study  
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an AE, the subject will be followed and treated by 
the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or stabilized.   
15.2 Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study  
A subject m ay be withdrawn from the study at any time if the subject, the investigator, or the 
Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.    
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for subject withdrawals. 
The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the subject’s source 
documents.    
15.3 Replacement  of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to the recording of the MRI images required for 
statistical analyses  will be replaced . 
16 PROTOCOL  VIOLATIONS  
A protocol violation occurs when the subject, investigator, or Sponsor fails to adhere to significant 
protocol requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, subject safety and primary endpoint 
criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but a re not limited to, the following:  
• Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol 
violation. The Sponsor will determine if a protocol violation will result in withdr awal of a subject.  
17 DATA  SAFETY MONITORING  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review data relating to safety and efficacy, will conduct 
and review interim analyses, and will ensure the continued scientific validity and merit of the 
study, according to the UCLA  Data Safety Monitoring Board Operations Manual. There will be at 
least 3 members, who will have no other role in  the trial, including at least one expert with 
statistical expertise, one member with clinical specialty of pediatric cardiology, and o ne member 
with experience serving on independent data review boards. At the first meeting, held before the 
trial either face -to-face or via tele -conference , the committee will approve or revise the charter . 
The chair of the DMC will be appointed  by the PI of the study .  
18 STATISTICAL  METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
The primary efficacy analysis of visual imaging quality will be conducted using all usable scans 
from the patients. All safety analyses will be conducted using a population defined as all patients 
under going study contrast -agent (Safety Population) .   
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 45 of 59 
 18.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
All eligible patients who receive Feraheme  or Ablavar  infusion as part of our study  will be included 
in the data analysis.  The results will be reported separately for the two contrast agents.  
18.2 Demographic  and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographic variables at screening will be summarized by treatment group and 
study part . While the study is too small to expect st atistical significance in sub -groups, the efficacy 
and safety results will be examined by standard age categories (neonates (0 -to-1 month of age), 
infants and toddlers (1 month to 2 years of age) and children (>2 years of age)) and any clinically 
important  differences reported . 
18.3 Definition of Numeric Efficacy Outcomes  
Subjective Image Quality  Scores : The image quality will be independently scored  by 2  board 
certified blinded readers  with >5 years of cardiovascular MRI  reading experience using a 1 -4 point 
scale  (1). The composite image quality score for each subject will be a number between 7 (all 
subjective image quality scores are 1=non -diagnostic) to 28 (all subjective image quality scores 
are 4=clear visualization). The scores will be assessed separately for each of the following seven  
anatomical  structures that are important for imaging pediatric CHD patients: the aortic root, the 
pulmonary artery (PA), the coronary arteries, the out -flow tra cts, the valves, the ventricles, and the 
atria. If the difference in the composite score is greater than or equal to 4 between two image 
readers, the readers will read the image together in a consensus reading session and arrive at a 
consensus for each of the 7 structures. The criteria for assigning scores will be as follows: 1) For 
aortic root and PA , 1=nondiagnostic  (vessels not visualized or diagnostically not assessable due 
to small size and /or motion artifact and /or poor contrast enhancement) , 2=vess els visualized but 
with poor contrast enhancement and /or motion artifact so as to limit confident assessment and 
measurement of dimensions , 3=vessels visualized with good contrast so as to enable confident 
assessment of patency but with poor edge definiti on due to motion artifact so as to limit confident 
measurement of dimensions , 4=vessels visualized with good contrast and good edge definition 
such that patency and dimensions are confidently assessable ; 2) For coronary arteries : 
1=nondiagnostic  (vessels n ot visualized or diagnostically not assessable due to small size and /or 
motion artifact and /or poor contrast enhancement) , 2=only origin s of main coronary arteries  
confidently identifiable, 3=origin s and proximal course of RCA and left anterior descendin g 
(LAD) confidently evaluable, 4=origin, proximal and mid courses of RCA and LAD and proximal 
takeoff of left circumflex confidently evaluable; 3) For out-flow tracts and valves : 
1=nondiagnostic  (structures not visualized or diagnostically not assessable d ue to small size and 
/or motion artifact and /or poor contrast enhancement , 2=annulus and sinotubular junction 
visualized but borders not sufficiently well defined for confident measurement , 3=annulus and 
sinotubular junction visualized with well defined b orders sufficient for confident measurement , 
4=annulus and sinotubular junction clearly visualized with well defined borders  sufficient for 
confident measurement and valve l eaflet s clearly seen ; 4) For the ventricles and atria : 
1=nondiagnostic  (chambers no t visualized or diagnostically not assessable due to small size and 
/or motion artifact and /or poor contrast enhancement , 2=chambers distinguishable but walls 
poorly defined and  only gross features evaluable, 3= chambers clearly distinguishable with well 
defined septum and free walls  confidently evaluable  but with poor definition of the papillary 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential

 muscles and trabeculae , 4=chambers clearly distinguishable with excellent wall definition and with 
clear  definition  of the papillary muscles and trabeculae.  
 
Image Sharpness  Values : Objective  image sharpness will be measured through the interventricular 
septum and ascending aorta  using a  previously described method (1). The image sharpness score s 
will be measured by drawing a linear signal profile and calculating the slope of the signal intensity 
curve. The slope is defined as the image intensity difference divided by the distance between the 
two points at 20% and 80% of the dynamic range, respectiv ely.  
 
Blood -Myocardium CNR : The blood -myocardium CNR will be measured by drawing three regions 
of interest (ROI), one at the center of left ventricular (LV) cavity, one at the interventricular septum 
and one in the background air region. The CNR will be c alculated as the difference in mean signal 
intensity between the LV cavity ROI and the septum ROI divided by the standard deviation of the 
background air ROI signal.  
 
18.4 Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
18.4.1  Part I  – Difference in the composite image quality score betw een Feraheme and Ablavar  
The primary efficacy endpoint for Part I is the composite image quality score, which is defined as 
the sum of the subject image quality scores assigned to seven important anatomical structures for 
pediatric CHD patients: the aortic  root, the PA, the coronary arteries, the outflow tracts, the valves, 
the ventricles, and the atria. The score will be the average scores from all the  image readers . The 
consensus reading will occur if the difference in the composite score from the same image is 4 or 
greater. The composite image quality score will be tested for normality using the Shapiro -Wilk 
and Shapiro -Francia tests . For normally distributed data, comp arison will be made  between the 
composite image quality scores for Feraheme and Ablavar using a parametric two-sided  t-test with 
an appropriate transformation if needed. If statistical transformation of the image  quality score  is 
not possible , a non -parame tric Wilcoxon -rank-sum test can be considered. The null hypothesis is 
that there is no difference in  the composite subjective image quality scores between Feraheme and 
Ablavar. This comparison will be a two -sided test at the overall 0.05 level of significa nce. 
Summary statistics of mean, standard deviation and their 95% confidence intervals of each contrast  
agent  and the difference will be used for statistical description. There will be a formal interim 
analysis and a primary analysis for image quality scor e. The primary analysis of image quality 
scores will be performed when 80 CHD subjects are enrolled and the images  are scored by the 
image readers . Scores for subjective image quality, sharpness  and CNR measurements  will remain 
blinded from the Investigato rs and only the study statistician will be able to pair the contrast 
assignment and the score.  
 
[Interim Analyses] : To avoid performing a study with larger -than-necessary enrollment for Part 
I of our study , a formal interim analysis for the composite imagi ng score will be performed at 
approximately 20 CHD subjects  for each of the contrast group  (50% of the target number for the 
primary  analysis). Alpha -spending for the interim analyse s and the primary analysis will be 0.025 
and 0.025 (both two -sided), respectively. The overall alpha for the composite image quality  score 
will be preserved at the two -sided 0.05 significance level. The interim analysis of  the composite 
image quality  score  will be conducted by an independent statistician under the charter of the DMC. 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 47 of 59 
 The interim effect of Feraheme compared to the Ablavar of ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  based 
on the average composite score from two image readers  will be tested with a two group  t-test with 
an appropriate transformation if needed . Non -parametric Wilcoxon  rank sum test will be 
considered if the data are not normally distributed based on the Shapiro -Wilk and Shapiro -Francia 
tests and transformation is not feasible.  
18.4.2  Part II  – Diffe rence in the composite image quality score between ventilator -gated and self -
gated MUSIC -MRI  
The primary efficacy endpoint for Part II is the composite image quality score defined in 18.4.1. 
Data will be tested for normality using the Shapiro -Wilk and Shap iro-Francia tests.  The composite 
subjective image quality score will be compared between ventilator -gated MUSIC -MRI  and the 
self-gated MUSIC -MRI  using a paired t -test with appropriate transformation if needed. If the data 
are not normally distributed and transformation is not possible, a Wilcoxon -sign-rank test will be 
considered. The null hypothesis is that the mean difference in the image quality scores of the self -
gated images is smaller than or equal to the mean from ventilator -gated images with the no n-
inferiority margin of – 1.75 (s elf−ventilator ≤ -1.75). The alternative hypothesis is that the mean 
difference in image quality score of self -gated images from the ventilator -gated images is greater 
than the non -inferiority margin of -1.75 (s elf−ventilat or > -1.75)  (see the detail of choosing the 
margin in section 18.7.2.).  
Rejection of the null hypothesis will occur if the p -value is ≤0.025. Scores for subjective image 
quality will remain blinded from the Investigators and only the study statistician wi ll be able to 
pair the MRI pulse sequence and the score. No interim analyses will be performed in Part II of the 
study.  
18.5 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
18.5.1  Part I  – Differences in individual image quality score (per segment or structure), image 
sharpness values, and CNR measurements for Feraheme vs Ablavar  
The secondary efficacy endpoint s for Part I are the individual  image quality score for each of the 
seven anatomical structures as defined in 18.3, the image sharpness values for the ascending a orta 
and the interventricular septum , and the CNR measurements  for each contrast agent . Data will be 
tested for normality using the Shapiro -Wilk and Shapiro -Francia tests.  The average image quality 
scores of each anatomic structure between two readers, th e image sha rpness values, and the CNR 
measurements  will be compared using a parametric two group t -test with an appropriate 
transformation if needed. If the data are not normally distributed and transformation is not possible , 
a non -parametric Wilcoxon -rank-sum test will be considered . Kappa statistics will be reported 
between two independent scores in each secondary endpoint . 
18.5.2  Part II  – Differences in individual image quality score (per segment or structure), image 
sharpness values, and CNR measurements for  ventilator -gated vs self -gated MUSIC -MRI  
The secondary efficacy points for Part II are the individual subjective image quality score for each 
of the seven anatomical structures as defined in 18.3, the image sharpness values for the ascending 
aorta and the  interventricular septum , and the CNR measurements for the two MRI techniques . 
Data will be tested for normality using the Shapiro -Wilk and Shapiro -Francia tests.  The average 
image quality scores of each anatomic structure between two readers, the image s harpness values, 
and the CNR measurements  will be compared using a paired t -test with the margin of non -
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 48 of 59 
 inferiority of 0.75  for the image quality scores . If the data are not normally distributed and 
transformation is not possible , a non -parametric Wilcoxon -rank-sum test will be considered . 
Kappa statistics will be reported between two independent scores in each secondary endpoint.  
18.6 Safety Evaluations  
AEs, SAEs , AEs resulting in premature withdrawal from the study, AEs of special interest 
(hypersensitivity reactions and blood pressure changes requiring intervention), and study related 
adverse events  will be listed and summarized by contrast agent group . For the purpo se of safety 
evaluation, the patients in both Part I and Part II who received the same contrast agent will be 
included in a single safety report. Due to the limited study cohort size and the small anticipated 
AE rates, n o formal inferential statistical ana lyses will be performed for AEs. However, w hile the 
study is too small to expect statistical significance in sub -groups, the efficacy and safety results 
will be examined by standard age categories (neonates (0 -to-1 month of age), infants and toddlers 
(1 mo nth to 2 years of age) and children (>2 years of age)) and any clinically important differences 
reported.  
18.7 Sample Size and Power Estimate fo r the Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
18.7.1  Part I  – Difference in the composite image quality score between Feraheme and Ablava r 
Sample size and power estimates are based on data from an internal pilot analysis.  Based on the 
average composite image quality scores of two independent readers , the mean image quality score 
was 25.62 with a standard deviation of 1.82 for the Feraheme -enhanced,  ventilator -gated MUSIC -
MRI  group . The difference in the image quality scores between two readers was a mean of -1.96 
with a standard deviation of 2.72. We expect the agreement between two independent reading s 
will improve  with consensus reading in cases with largely different image quality scores (4 or more 
absolute difference in the score).  
          
Based on the above preliminary analyses, for the interim analys is, a sample size of 20 in each 
contrast agent group  will achieve a power  of 62% to detect a difference of 1.75 (7% reduction) in 
the composite image quality  scores between  the Ablavar group  and the Feraheme group  with an 
estimated standard deviation of 2.10 in each group  and a significance level of 2.5%.  
In the primary  analys is, a sample size of 36 subjects will achieve a power of 90% to detect a 
difference of 1.75 (7% reduction) in composite image quality scores between the Ablavar group  
and the Feraheme group with an  estimated standard deviation of 2.10 in each arm and a 
signific ance level of 2.5%. Taking into c onsider ation missing data due to unusable image quality  
or incomplete studies , we plan to enroll 40 CHD subjects in each group  (N=80).  
18.7.2  Part II  – Difference in the composite image quality score between ventilator -gated and self-
gated MUSIC -MRI  
The quality of self -gated images are expected to be of at least equal quality  to ventilator -gated 
images with a larger standard deviation due to variation in the methods of respiratory motion 
gating . We choose the non -inferior margin  (87) to ensure that the upper bound o f the 95% confidence 
interval ( CI) for the difference between ventilator -gated and self -gated (ventilator − self-gated) is 
less than 1.75 . We expect the mean of the composite image quality score for ventilator -gated 
images to be approximately 25.62 , which is the expected upper limit of the self -gated image quality 
Protocol  Number: 0001  Confidential  
 
Version #:  6 Version Date: 01/13/2016  Page 49 of 59 
 score.  The margin of 1.75 was derived using an expected mean of 24.75 for the self -gated image 
(~4% reduction in image quality score compared to that achieved with the ventilator -gated 
method) . The non-inferiority comparison will be a one -sided test at a 0.025 level of statistical 
significance and a -1.75 margin. A sample size of 36 will achieve a statistical power  of greater 
than 90% to detect non -inferiority between ventilator -gated and self -gated MUSIC -MRI  using a 
one-sided t -test with a non -inferiority  margin of -1.75 and a true difference of zero with a standard 
deviation of 3.0 and a significance level of 2.5%. Taking into account missing data due to unusable 
image quality  or incomplete studies, w e plan to enroll 40 CHD subjects.  
19 DATA COLLECTION , RETENTION AND MONITORING  
19.1 Data Collection  Instruments  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents designed to 
record all observations and other  pertinent data for each subject treated with the study drug.   
Study personnel will enter data from source documents corresponding to a subject’s visit into the 
protocol -specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) when the information correspondi ng to tha t 
visit is available. Subjects will not be  identified by name in the study database or on any study 
documents to be collected by the Sponsor (or designee), but will be identified by a subject number 
and initials.  
If a correction is required for an eCRF, the  time and date stamps track the person entering o r 
updating eCRF data and create  an electronic audit trail.   
The Investigator s are  responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this study.  
All data collected during the course  of this study must be reviewed and verified for completeness 
and accuracy by the Investigator s.  A copy of the eCRF will remain at the Investigator s’ site at the 
completion of the study.  
19.2 Data  Management Procedures  
The data will be entered into a validated  database. The Data Management group will be responsible 
for data processing, in accordance with procedural documentation. Database lock will occur once 
quality assurance procedures have been completed.  
All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing 
practices meeting FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.  
19.3 Data Quality  Control and Reporting  
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data validation 
checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. All changes to the study 
database will be documented.  
19.4 Archival  of Data  
The database is safeguarded against unauthorized access by established security procedures; 
appropr iate backup copies of the database and related software files will be 
maintained.   Databases  are backed up by the database administrator in conjunction with any

will ensure the reliability and availability of source documents fr om which the information on the 
CRF was derived.  
All study documents (patient files, signed informed consent forms, copies of CRFs, Study File 
Notebook, etc.)  will be kept secured for two years after the center has  been notified that the IND 
has been discontinued.  There may be other circumstances for which the Sponsor is required to 
maintain study records and, therefore, the Sponsor will be contacted prior to removing study 
records for any reason.  
19.6 Monitoring  
Monitoring visits will be conducted by representatives of the Sponsor according to the U.S. CFR 
Title 21 Parts 50, 56, and 312 and ICH Guidelines for GCP (E6).   By signing this protocol, the 
Investigator g rants permission to the Sponsor (or designee), and appropriate regulatory authorities 
to conduct on -site monitoring and/or auditing of all appropriate study documentation.  
19.7 Subject Confidentiality  
In order to maintain subject confidentiality, only a subject  number and subject initials will  identify 
all study subjects on CRFs and other documentation submitted to the Sponsor.  Additional subject 
confidentiality issues (if applicable) are covered in the Clinical Study Agreement.  
20 ADMINISTRATIVE , ETHICAL, REGULAT ORY CONSIDERATIONS  
The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of Human 
Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and Obligations of Clinical

 another locked file cabinet.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission 
of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by the FDA.  The Investigator must also comply 
with all applicable privacy regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC).  
20.1 Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to the protocol will be written by the Investigators . Protocol  amendments cannot  
be implemented without prior written IRB approval except as necessary to eliminate immedia te 
safety hazards to patients. A protocol amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate 
hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, provided the IRBs are notified within five 
working days.  
20.2 Institutional Review  Boards and Independent Ethics Committees  
The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by the IRB of the participating 
center  prior to study initiation. Serious adv erse experiences regardless of causality will be reported 
to the IRB in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB, and the 
Investigator will keep the IRB informed as to the progress of the study.  The Investigator will 
obtai n assurance of IRB compliance with regulations.  
Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, protocol 
amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning patient recruitment, 
payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) will be submitted to t he IRB.  
The IRBs written unconditional approval of the study protocol and the informed consent form will 
be in the possession of the Investigator before the study is initiated. This approval must refer to 
the study by exact protocol title and number and s hould identify the documents reviewed and the 
date of review.  
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without prior 
written IRB approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patients or 
when the  change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Such 
modifications will be submitted to the IRB and written verification that the modification was 
submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.   
The IRB must be inform ed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for review; serious 
and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in accordance with the standard 
operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new information that may affect adver sely the safety 
of the patients of the conduct of the study; an annual update and/or request for re -approval; and 
when the study has been completed.

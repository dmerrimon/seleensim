from the 10  mg/mL to the 100 mg/mL 
formulation of ravulizumab with no 
change to the weight -based dose regimen 
during the Long- Term Extension Period.  To provide language that allows 
patients to be switched from the 
10 mg/mL to the 100 mg/mL 
formulation of ravulizumab.  
Section 1.1 Synopsis, 
Section  1.2 Schema, 
Section  4.1 Overall Design, 
Section  4.2.3 Rationale for 
the Duration of the Primary Treatment Period, Section  4.4 End of Primary

Acuity  Clarified the Landolt C assessment 
procedure.  To provide clarity regarding the visual 
acuity measurement process in the trial.  
Section  8.3.3 Vital Signs  Clarif ied that body temperature may be 
oral, temporal, or axillary.  To provide clarity on methods allowed 
for temperature assessment.  
Section  9.1 Statistical 
Hypotheses  The hypothesis statement for the 
adjudicated On -trial ARR is revised from 
emphasis on the up per 95% confidence 
interval to being based on the mean 
adjudicated On -trial ARR.  To provide a hypothesis consistent with 
a 2-sided p- value approach for this 
endpoint.  
Section 9.2 Sample Size 
Determination  Changed the term “time to first relapse” to 
“time to first adjudicated On -trial 
Relapse.”  To improve clarity.  
Section  9.4 Statistical 
Analysis; and 9.5 Interim 
Analysis  Added that immunogenicity study data will 
be included in the final analysis of the 
Primary Treatment Period.  Added for completeness.

would be the primary analysis set to account for potential differences resulting 
from missed or delayed dosing due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic. Also clarified that 
sensitivity analyses would account for 
baseline imbalances between the treatment 
groups.  Removed the mFAS i n response to 
regulatory feedback  and added 
sensitivity analysis statement for 
clarity .

which treatment is a factor and the ranks of 
the baseline values is a covariate.  Changed to use an analysis more 
suitable for a nonrandomized trial.  
Section 9.4.1.2.5  
Accounting for Multiple 
Comparisons  Removed reference to the upper 95% CI 
when describing statistical significan ce. Reframed analysis of ARR from 95% 
CI approach to 2- sided p- value 
approach.

Alexion Confidential  1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, External Placebo-Controlled, Open-Label, Multicenter Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ravulizumab in Adult Patients with Neuromyelitis Optica 
Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)  
Short Title: A Phase 3 Efficacy and Safety Study of Ravulizumab in Adult Patients with 
NMOSD  
Rationale: 
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an ultra -rare, severe, disabling autoimmune 
inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that predominantly affects the optic 
nerves and spinal cord. In June 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
SOLIRIS® (eculizumab), a first -generation complement inhibitor, for the treatment of NMOSD 
in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody (Ab) positive. Findings from the 
clinical development program of eculizumab in patients with NMOSD support the ratio nale for 
complement component 5 (C5) inhibition as a therapeutic approach for reducing the risk of relapses in NMOSD. Ravulizumab has a longer elimination half -life than eculizumab while 
binding the same epitope on C5, which enables an extended dosing inte rval while maintaining 
the high degree of specificity for C5 achieved by eculizumab in inhibiting terminal complement activity.  
Given that eculizumab has been proven to reduce the risk of relapse in adult patients with 
NMOSD, and considering the similar mechanism of action and binding site between 
ravulizumab and eculizumab, this study is being undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ravulizumab in adult patients with NMOSD. The goal of this study is to provide NMOSD 
patients with a treatment option that reduces overall treatment burden by requiring less frequent 
infusions relative to eculizumab, while maintaining a comparable benefit/risk profile.  
Objectives and Endpoints:  
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
• To evaluate the effect of ravulizumab on 
adjudicated On -triala Relapses in adult patients

a On-trial Relapses refer to relapses as determined by the Treating Physician that occur during the study treatment 
period. All relapses will be adjudicated by a separate Adjudication Committee  
Overall Design 
Study ALXN1210- NMO-307 is a Phase 3, external placebo -controlled, open- label, multicenter 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ravulizumab in adult patients with NMOSD. 
Approximately 55 eligible adult patients with NMOSD will be enrolled. 
This study will employ a single- arm treatment design, utilizing the placebo group from Study 
ECU- NMO-301 (conducted 2014 to 2018) as an external placebo control. This will allow for a 
robust assessment of ravulizumab as a treatment option for NMOSD.  
There are 4 periods in this study: Screening Period, Primary Treatment Period, Long -Term 
Extension Period, and Safety Follow- up Period. Patients will be screened for eligibility for up to 
6 weeks during the Screening Period. The end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered 
when either (1) 2 patients have had an adjudicated On- trial Relapse; or (2) all patients have 
completed, or discontinued prior to, the Week 26 Visit; whichever comes later. However, if 2 patients have not had an adjudicated On- trial Relapse by the time all patients have completed,  
or discontinued prior to, the Week 50 visit, the end of the Primary Treatment Period will be 
triggered at that time. Note that patients who complete the visits indicated above (Week 26 or 
Week 50) will remain on the study in the Primary Treatment Period u ntil the Primary Treatment 
Period ends.  For examples of different scenarios of the end of the Primary Treatment Period, 
please refer to Section 4.4.  Based on the estimated enrollment rate, the duration of the Primary 
Treatment Period for each patient is expected to be between 26 weeks and approximately 
2.5 years. The Primary Treatment Period ends and the Long- Term Extension Period starts when 
all patients have completed their End of Primary Treatment (EOPT) Visit within the timeframe specified in Section 4.4. All patients will continue to receive  ravulizumab during the Long- Term 
Extension Period for up to approximately 2 years, or until ravulizumab is approved and/or 
available (in accordance with country -specific regulations), whichever occurs first. The total 
treatment duration for each patient w ill be up to approximately 4.5 years. After the last dose of 
study drug or early discontinuation (ED), patients will be followed for 8 weeks. 
Disclosure Statement : This is a single -arm treatment study with no masking.  
Number of Patient s: 
Approximately 55 e ligible patients will be enrolled . 
Study Drug Groups and Duration:  
Eligible patients will enroll into the study to receive intravenous infusions of ravulizumab.

Alexion Confidential  The ravulizumab dose for each patient will be based on body weight. The dosing regimen 
consists of a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing administered every 8 weeks (q8w). 
The maintenance dosing should be initiated 2 weeks after the loading dose administration.  
Patients may be switched from the 10  mg/mL to the 100 mg/mL formulation of ravuli zumab 
with no change to the weight-based dose regimen during the Long- Term Extension Period.  
For each patient, the total duration of study participation will be up to approximately 4.75 years, including the Screening Period (up to 6 weeks), the Primary Treatment Period (between 26 weeks and approximately 2.5 years), the Long- Term Extension Period (up to approximately 
2 years), and the Safety Follow -up Period (8 weeks).

1All eligible patients will receive open -label ravulizumab during the Primary Treatment Period. The end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered either 
when (1) 2 patients have had an adjudicated On -trial Relapse; or (2) all patients have completed, or discontinued prior to, the Week 26 Visit; whichever comes 
later. However, if 2 patients have not had an adjudicated On -trial Relapse by the time all patients have completed, or  discontinued prior to, the Week 50 visit, 
the end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered at that time. Note that patients who complete the visits indicated above (Week 26 or Week 50) will 
remain on the study in the Primary Treatment Period unti l the Primary Treatment Period ends. Based on the estimated enrollment rate, the duration of the 
Primary Treatment Period for each patient is expected to be between 26 weeks and approximately 2.5 years.  
2 The Primary Treatment Period ends and the Long -Term  Extension Period starts when all patients have completed their End of Primary Treatment (EOPT) Visit 
within the time frame specified in Section  4.4. Patients will continue to receive ravulizumab during the Long -Term Extension Period for up to approximately 
2 years, or until ravulizumab is approved and/or available (in accordance with country- specific regulations), whichever occurs first.  
3The primary a nalysis for regulatory submission will be conducted at the end of the Primary Treatment Period, and will include all availabl e efficacy, safety, and 
PK/PD/ADA data collected from the Primary Treatment Period.  
Note: Patients may be switched  from the 10  mg/mL to the 100 mg/mL formulation of ravulizumab with no change to the weight -based dose regimen during the 
Long- Term Extension Period .

Alexion Confidential  2. INTRODUCTION  
Complement activation is a key element in the development of CNS injury in neuromyelitis 
optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Ravulizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) with high specificity against human complement component 5 (C5). It is current ly being developed as a treatment for NMOSD in adult patients. 
2.1. Study Rationale  
The basis of developing ravulizumab for NMOSD stems from prior experience with eculizumab (SOLIRIS®), a first -generation complement inhibitor, which is approved by the U.S. FDA for 
the treatment of NMOSD in adult patients who are anti-AQP4 Ab positive. Findings from the clinical development program for eculizumab in NMOSD support the rationale for C5 inhibition as a therapeutic approach for reducing the risk of relapses in patien ts with NMOSD  
(Pittock SJ, 2019). 
Ravulizumab shares > 99% amino acid sequence homology with eculizumab. Ravulizumab and eculizumab share the same mechanism of action, targeting the same C5 epitope with high 
specificity. However, as a result of 4 amino acid sub stitutions, the serum elimination half- life of 
ravulizumab is prolonged, enabling an extended dosing interval. Despite a longer dosing interval, 
ravulizumab has demonstrated a similar degree of terminal complement inhibition compared to 
eculizumab in patie nts with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), another complement-
mediated disease, for which both products are approved in the US. Complement inhibition is the 
only mechanism of action of eculizumab in NMOSD, and the fact that it has been proven to 
significantly reduce the risk of relapse provides a strong rationale for studying ravulizumab in 
NMOSD.  
This study is being undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ravulizumab in adult patients with NMOSD, using the placebo group from Study ECU- NMO- 301 as an external 
control. If successful, this may provide patients with a treatment option that reduces overall 
disease burden by requiring less frequent infusions relative to eculizumab, while maintaining a 
comparable benefit/risk profile.  
Detailed  information about ravulizumab can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.2. Background 
2.2.1. Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder  
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is a severe disabling autoimmune inflammatory disorder 
of the CNS that predominately affect s the optic nerves and spinal cord, and less commonly the 
brain. The disorder is ultra -rare, affecting 0.5 to 4.4 per 100,000 worldwide inhabitants  
(Pandit L, 2015). 
The most common manifestations of NMOSD are characterized by recurrent, severe relapses of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis  (TM) , which result in a stepwise accumulation of relapse-
related neurologic disability that can be irreversible (Wingerchuk DM, 2006). The annualized 
relapse rate (ARR) for patients with NMOSD is estimated to be about 1 relapse per year per 
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 35 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  patient, with the vast majority of patients experiencing relapse  (Flanagan EP, 2016;  Ghezzi A, 
2004; Jarius S, 2012). 
In a st udy of AQP4- Ab positive neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients, morbidity was significant 
with 18% experiencing permanent visual disability, 34% experiencing permanent motor 
disability, and 23% experiencing wheelchair dependency during the follow-up period  
(Kitley J, 2012). 
2.2.2. Unmet Medical Need  
SOLIRIS® (eculizumab), the first- in-class complement component C5 inhibitor, is the only 
therapy approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of NMOSD in adult patients who are anti-AQP4 Ab positive. Supportive treatments, including corticosteroids and other 
immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs), have been used based on clinical experience and consensus (Trebst C, 2014) . Despite the use of ISTs as suppo rtive therapy, a significant number of patients 
(> 50%) continued to experience disease relapses that resulted in incremental and permanent neurologic deficits and disability (Bichuetti DB, 2010;  Jacob A, 2009). 
Eculizumab has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing relapse risk. After the initial 
induction dose, eculizumab is administered every 2 weeks (q2w) to maintain adequate complement suppression. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is a chronic disease, and a frequent dosage regimen may impose a sig nificant burden on patients, many of whom are 
disabled and require assistance with transportation.  
Ravulizumab has a longer serum terminal elimination half -life and corresponding duration of 
pharmacologic activity relative to eculizumab. Ravulizumab was de signed based on 
comprehensive modelling and simulation analyses to maintain efficacious concentrations across a longer dosing interval. The q8w dosage regimen is less burdensome for patients and has 4- fold 
fewer pharmacokinetic (PK) troughs, leading to fewer opportunities for achieving incomplete 
complement inhibition associated with sub-therapeutic exposure. The reduction in infusion 
frequency offers the potential to provide patients and physicians with an additional option for effective treatment of NMOSD  while also improving quality of life (QoL) through fewer missed 
days of work, better treatment adherence, and improved accessibility. 
2.2.3. Role of Complement Activation in NMOSD  
Complement activation is a major determinant of disease pathogenesis in patients with NMOSD 
(Hinson SR, 2009; Nytrova, 2014;  Papadopoulos MC, 2012; Verkman, 2012). Binding of AQP4 
IgG to the AQP4 water channel, which is highly expressed on astrocytic surfaces in the CNS, has been shown to lead to hexameric assembly of immunoglobulin G (IgG). This in turn recruits and activates complement C1, the first step in activation of the complement cascade (Diebolder CA, 
2014) . Complement activatio n initiates an inflammatory cascade that induces permeabilization of 
the blood brain barrier and astrocyte necrosis. Lesions that form during this process are indicative of NMOSD and are positive for anti -AQP4 Abs and complement ( Papadopoulos MC, 
2012). 
The therapeutic role of inhibition of terminal complement activation was demonstrated with 
eculizumab in Study ECU- NMO-301. Study ECU- NMO-301 was a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled, multicenter study th at evaluated the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in 
patients with relapsing NMOSD. A significant effect on the time to first adjudicated On -trial

Alexion Confidential  Relapse was observed for eculizumab compared with placebo (p<0.0001). An approximately 
94.2% reduction in the risk of relapse was observed in patients who received eculizumab 
compared with placebo ( Pittock SJ, 2019). In conjunction with the efficacy results, the serum 
free C5 results indicated that immediate, complete, and sustained terminal complement inhibition 
was achieved. 
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and expected adverse events (AEs) of ravulizumab may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.3.1. Risk Assessment  
Ravulizumab functions by blocking term inal complement; therefore, patients have increased 
susceptibility to serious infections, in particular, Neisseria meningitidis ( N meningitidis ). 
Specific risk mitigation measures in place are described in Section  8.1.4. 
Based on the past human experience and cumulative clinical trial safety data of ravulizumab in 
PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), ravulizumab has been demonstrated to 
be well  tolerated and safe, and exposure to ravulizumab in humans has not raised any unexpected 
safety concerns.  
As with any humanized mAb, administration of ravulizumab may lead to the development of 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Monitoring of immunogenicity is planned, as described in 
Section  8.9. Administration of any investigational product may result in infusion reactions. 
Management of potential infusion reactions is described in Section  10.14. 
2.3.2. Benefit Assessment  
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is a severe, disabling disease with relapses and cumulative disability occurring in more than 90% of cases ( Wingerchuk DM, 2006). The 
efficacy and safety of eculizumab compared to placebo in the treatment of adult  patients with 
anti-AQP4 Ab -positive NMOSD has been demonstrated in Study ECU- NMO -301, a 
multinational, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 3 time- to-event study, in which treatment with 
eculizumab reduced the risk of NMOSD relapse by 94.2% compared to plac ebo (p<0.0001) 
(Pittock SJ, 2019). Given the high homology and specificity to complement component C5 
between ravulizumab and eculizumab, treatment with ravulizumab is expected to result in 
comparable reduction in the risk of relapses in adult NMOSD patients.  
2.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to patients participating in this study, 
the potential risks identified in association with ravulizumab are justified by the anticipated 
benefits that may be afforded to  patients with NMOSD.

Alexion Confidential  4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design 
Study ALXN1210- NMO-307 is a Phase 3, external placebo-controlled, open- label, multicenter 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ravulizumab in adult patients with NMOSD. 
Approximately 55 eligible adult patients with NMOSD from North America, Europe, and the 
Asia Pacific region will be enrolled  into the study. Enrollment for each geographic region will be 
approximately 28% to 40% of the total population (Section 6.3 ). 
There are 4 periods in this study: Screening Period, Primary Treatment Period, Long- Term 
Extension Period, and Safety Follow- up Period. Patients will be screened for eligibility for up to 
6 weeks during the Screening Period. The end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered 
when either (1) 2 patients have had an adjudicated On- trial Relapse; or (2) all patients have 
completed, or discontinued prior to, the Week 26 Visit; whichever com es later. However, if 
2 patients have not had an adjudicated On- trial Relapse by the time all patients have completed, 
or discontinued prior to, the Week 50 visit, the end of the Primary Treatment Period will be 
triggered at that time. Note that patients w ho complete the visits indicated above (Week 26 or 
Week 50) will remain on the study in the Primary Treatment Period until the Primary Treatment 
Period ends.  For examples of different scenarios of the end of the Primary Treatment Period, 
please refer to S ection 4.4 . Based on the estimated enrollment rate, the duration of the Primary 
Treatment Period for each patient is expected to be between 26 weeks an d approximately 
2.5 years. The Primary Treatment Period ends and the Long- Term Extension Period starts when 
all patients have completed their End of Primary Treatment (EOPT) Visit within the timeframe 
specified in Section  4.4. All patients will continue to receive ravulizumab during the Long -Term 
Extension Period for up to approximately 2 years, or until ravulizumab is approved and/or 
available (in acco rdance with country -specific regulations), whichever occurs first. Based on the 
estimated enrollment rate of NMOSD patients, the total treatment duration for each patient will 
be up to approximately 4.5 years. After the last dose of study drug or early dis continuation (ED), 
patients will be followed for 8 weeks. The total study duration for each patient will be up to approximately 4.75 years.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
The study has been designed to provide data that adequately characterize the benefit -risk profile 
of ravulizumab for the treatment of patients with NMOSD, using placebo data from Study ECU -
NMO-301 as an external control. 
4.2.1. External Placebo -Controlled, Open -Label Design  
Study ECU- NMO-301 demonstrated the efficacy of eculizumab in reduc ing NMOSD relapses, 
with a 94.2% reduction in the risk of relapse as compared with placebo ( Pittock SJ, 2019) . As a 
derivative of eculizumab, ravulizumab targets an identical C5 motif to inhibit terminal 
complement activity and is expected to have a similar effect on relapses as that produced by 
eculizumab.  
The recent approval of Soliris for NMOSD, the first approved therapy for NMOSD, is expected to change the treatment landscape and make it challenging to randomize patients to a placebo

Alexion Confidential  group. However, it is important to employ a comparator group to provide adequate assessment of 
the safety and efficacy of ravulizumab.  
A single-arm design, utilizing the placebo group from Study ECU- NMO-301 (conducted 2014 to 
2018) as an external placebo control, allows for a robust assessment of ravulizumab as a treatment option for NMOSD. Whenever possible, in order to ensure a valid comparison, 
constancy will be maintained with Study ECU- NMO -301, including the inclusion of similar 
patient populations, permitted concomitant medications, adjudication procedures, and endpoints. 
4.2.2. Rationale for the Selected Endpoints  
4.2.2.1. Efficacy Endpoints  
In NMOSD, the measurable, biological aspects include relapse and disability. Disability in 
NMOSD is a direct consequence of relapse, suppor ting the relevance of measuring relapses as 
the efficacy endpoint in Study ALXN1210- NMO-307. 
In this study, the occurrence of relapses is evaluated using the primary endpoint time to first adjudicated On- trial Relapse and the secondary endpoint ARR. Time t o first adjudicated On- trial 
Relapse provides useful information regarding the efficacy of ravulizumab. Since effectiveness 
of a treatment can be based on delaying and/or reducing the occurrence of relapses, a time to first 
relapse endpoint is an appropria te efficacy endpoint for prospectively designed studies in 
NMOSD (Weinshenk er, 2015). The external placebo group from Study ECU- NMO-301 will be 
utilized as an appropriate control group given that the primary endpoint in that trial was also time 
to first adjudicated On -trial Relapse and the adjudication process and relapse definition will 
remain constant between the two trials.  
Additionally, the effect of ravulizumab on the frequency of relapses will be measured using the Adjudicated On- trial A RR. A 95% confidence interval will be calculated around the ARR. 
4.2.3. Rationale for the Duration of the Primary Treatment Period  
In Study ALXN1210- NMO -307, the end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered when 
either (1) 2 patients have had an adjudicated On- trial Relapse; or (2) all patients have completed, 
or discontinued prior to, the Week 26 Visit; whichever comes later. However, if 2  patients have 
not had an adjudicated On- trial Relapse by the time all patients have completed, or discontinu ed 
prior to, the Week 50 visit, the end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered at that time. Note that patients who complete the visits indicated above (Week 26 or Week 50) will 
remain on the trial in the Primary Treatment Period until the Prima ry Treatment Period ends. 
Based on the estimated enrollment rate, the first patient enrolled will have been in the Primary 
Treatment Period for up to approximately 2.5 years, with the remaining patients having been in 
the Primary Treatment Period ranging b etween 26 weeks and up to approximately 2.5 years.  
The cut- off of 26 weeks for the last patient was chosen for several reasons. In 
Study ECU- NMO-301, key observations could already be made by that time: 2 of the 
3 adjudicated On- trial Relapses observed in the eculizumab group were observed, and 12 of 
20 adjudicated On-trial Relapses had been observed in the placebo group. Given the similarities 
of ravulizumab and eculizumab, we expect to see a similar response in the first 26 weeks of 
treatment with ravuliz umab. This design ensures that there will be limited number of patients 
censored during the first 26 weeks in the analysis of the time to first adjudicated On -trial 
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 40 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  Relapse: in Study ECU -NMO-301, only 5 out of 143 (3.5%) patients had discontinued study 
treatment within the first 26 weeks (4 in the eculizumab arm and 1 in the placebo arm). It is also 
recognized that based on expected enrollment timelines, many of the patients will have been on 
treatment for more than 1 year by the time the last patient completes their Week 26 Visit, providing efficacy and safety data over time that allows for a robust comparison with data 
collected over a similar timeframe in the placebo group of Study ECU -NMO -301. 
In the event that 2 patients have not experienced an adjudica ted On -trial Relapse by the time the 
last patient has completed the Week 26 visit, all patients will remain in the Primary Treatment Period until 2 patients have experienced an adjudicated On- trial Relapse, or until the last patient 
has completed the Week 50 Visit. The criteria of the maximal additional follow -up time and the 
2 adjudicated On- trial Relapses in 2 patients are chosen in part to more closely approximate the 
mean time on treatment (89.4 weeks) and the adjudicated On -trial ARR (0.02) of patients  in the 
eculizumab arm of Study ECU- NMO-301. Furthermore, if the full additional 24 weeks of 
follow -up occur, this will ensure that all patients who do not discontinue pre- maturely will have 
a minimum of 50 weeks of follow -up. 
4.2.4. Rationale for the Selected Pa tient Population  
Complement activation is a major determinant of disease pathogenesis in patients with 
anti-AQP4 positive NMOSD ( Nytrova, 2014) . Inhibiting terminal complement activation with 
ravulizumab, therefore, represents a biologically rational approach for the treatment of patients with anti- AQP4 positive NMOSD. Study entry criteria were carefully selected to reflect an adult 
patient population consistent with the anti-AQP4 positive NMOSD population likely to be 
treated with ravulizumab in clinical practice.  
4.3. Justification for Dose  
4.3.1. Ravulizumab 
Targeting complete terminal complement inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of patients with NMOSD has been validated by data from the eculizumab clinical pro gram. The 
dosing regimen of ravulizumab was designed to target immediate, complete, and sustained 
inhibition of terminal complement in patients. The weight-based doses of ravulizumab in the 
PNH program were premised on PK/PD data from early and late clinic al development studies in 
healthy adult volunteers and patients with PNH. The proposed ravulizumab dosage regimen 
(Section  6.1; Section  8.1.6.1) is the approved regimen for the treatment of patients with PNH 
ULTOMIRIS
® United States Prescribing Information (USPI), and the same dose regimen is also 
included in the initial marketing authorization application (MAA) in the EU. Therefore, the same dosage regimen is selected for this study. Additional PK/PD information suppor ting the selected 
dose reg imen can be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
Patients may be switched from the 10  mg/mL to the 100 mg/mL formulation of ravulizumab 
with no change to the weight-based dose regimen during the Long- Term Extension P eriod. The 
100 mg/mL IV formulation of ULTOMIRIS
® (ravulizumab) is commercially approved in the 
United States, European Union, and Japan for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The 100  mg/mL 
ravulizumab is a higher concentration IV formulation which provides shorter preparation and

Alexion Confidential  infusion times while delivering comparable PK, safety, and efficacy to the 10 mg/mL 
formulation of ravulizumab.  
4.3.2. Supplemental Dose  
Supplemental doses of ravuliz umab (Section  8.1.6.2) may be administered to patients who 
receive plasma exchange (PE)/p lasmapheresis (PP) (Section  6.5.1.3) or IVIg (Section  6.5.2) as 
acute therapy following an On- trial Relaps e. The sup plemental dose of ravulizumab has been 
selected based on PK simulations. Consistent with approved eculizumab labeling for treating adult and pediatric patients with aHUS, adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and adult patients with NMOSD, supplemental dosing of ravulizumab in the amount of 50% 
(rounded up if not an integral of 300 mg due to vial configuration) will be given in the setting of concomitant PP/PE therapy. 
4.4. End of Primary Treatment 
The end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered when either (1) 2 patients have had an 
adjudicated On- trial Relapse; or (2) all patients have completed, or discontinued prior to, the 
Week 26 Visit; whichever comes later. However, if 2 patients have not had an adjudicat ed On -
trial Relapse by the time all patients have completed, or discontinued prior to, the Week 50 visit, the end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered at that time. Note that patients who complete the visits indicated above (Week 26 or Week 50 ) will remain on the study in the 
Primary Treatment Period until the Primary Treatment Period ends.  
The 3 ways that the Primary Treatment Period may end, given the above criteria, are as described in the following examples:  
1. If 2 adjudicated On-trial Relapses have been observed by the time all patients have 
completed, or discontinued prior to, Week 26, the end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered.
 
2. If all patients have completed Week 26, or discontinued prior to Week 26, and 2 adjudicated On -trial Relapses have not yet been observed, but 2 adjudicated On-
trial Relapses are then observed before all patients have completed, or discontinued 
prior to, Week 50, then the end of the Primary Treatment Period will be triggered 
when the second adjudicated On- trial Relapse has been adjudicated positively.  
3. If 2 adjudicated On -trial Relapses have not been observed by the time all patients 
have completed Week 50, or discontinued prior to Week 50, then the end of the Primary Treatment Period would be triggered at that time.  
If the EOPT Visit coincides with an upcoming scheduled study visit, patients will be required to 
complete all assessments for the EOPT Visit and can also be administered their scheduled dose 
of ravulizumab. 
The end of the Primary Treatment Period is defined as the end of the 14-day window of the 
EOPT Visit.

may supply or administer study drug. All study drug must be stored in a secure, 
environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance 
with the labeled storage conditions  with access limited to the Investigator and authorized 
site staff.  
3. The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study drug accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
4. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study drugs are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
For detailed instruction on study drug preparation, handling, storage, and accountability, refer to 
the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
This is a single -arm, open-label study. All study patients, site personnel, Sponsor staff, Sponsor 
designees, and all staff directly associated with the conduct of the tri al will be unblinded to 
patient treatment assignments.  
To minimize potential for bias in this open -label study, operational measures will be employed 
regarding the efficacy endpoints and adjudication process. The trial database will be monitored 
according to prespecified guidelines in order to confirm that all potential relapses are collected and analyzed. An independent Relapse Adjudication Committee will evaluate each On- trial 
Relapse and confirm whether it meets the protocol defined criteria fo r an NMOSD relapse 
(Section  8.2.3.2). Additionally, while the EDSS Raters will be aware that all patients are on 
ravulizumab, the EDSS Raters will be blinded to all trial data when making their assessments.  
The external control will be the placebo arm of Study ECU- NMO -301, a randomized double-
blind study conducted from 2014 to 2018, and upon which this study is based. The design is similar in most as pects: the inclusion criteria are the same in most cases, with modifications that 
include using the most recently updated NMOSD diagnostic criteria and updated historical relapse rate parameters.  To minimize any biases arising from slight differences in study designs 
and unforeseen enrollment differences, statistical analyses will include covariate adjustment 
techniques as warranted.  
Enrollment for each geographic region will be approximately 28% to 40% of the total 
population. This will allow for relative maintenance of constancy from a regional standpoint 
between the ALXN1210- NMO-307 and the ECU- NMO-301 study populations. 
6.4. Study Drug Compliance  
The infusion of study drug into patients will be under the supervision of the Investigator or their 
designee to en sure that the patients receive the appropriate dose at the appropriate timepoints 
during the study.

Alexion Confidential  The date and time of each dose administered will be recorded in the source documents and 
recorded in the case report form (CRF).  
6.5. Concomitant Therapy  
Any medication (including over- the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, minerals, 
and/or herbal supplements) or vaccine that the patient is receiving at the time of enrollment or 
receives during the study must be recorded in the patient’s source document/ medical chart and 
electronic case report form (eCRF)  along with: 
• Reason for use 
• Dates of administration including start and end dates  
• Dosage information including dose and frequency 
Any changes in concomitant medications also will be recorded in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. When possible, concomitant medications will be recorded 
from the first infusion of ravulizumab until the patient has discontinued or completed the study.  
Information regarding the use of ISTs including steroids must be collected. Meningococcal 
vaccination and antibiotics administered for prophylaxis of meningococcal infection (if 
applicable) will also be recorded.  
Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the patient’s care during the study, or for the 
treatment of any AE, along with any other medications, other than those listed as disallowed 
medications in Section  6.5.2, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. However, it is 
the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are recorded 
in full in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF.  
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any  questions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy. 
6.5.1. Allowed Medications and Therapies 
The following concomitant medications and therapies are allowed in this study. 
6.5.1.1. Palliative and Supportive Care  
Palliative and supportive care is permitted during the course  of the trial for underlying 
conditions. 
6.5.1.2. Immunosuppressive Agents  
The supportive immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs) for relapse prevention, either in 
combination or monotherapy, are permitted at the discretion of the Investigator, such as: 
• corticosteroids 
• azathioprine (AZA) 
• mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)  
• methotrexate (MTX)  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0

Alexion Confidential  • tacrolimus (TAC)  
• cyclosporine 
• cyclophosphamide 
If a patient receives supportive ISTs prior to the study and continues to receive stable 
maintenance therapy during the study, refer to inclusion criteria (Section  5.1) for the 
requirements on ISTs to ensure that the patient is on a stable dose within limits required for this study as described in study criteria (Section  5). 
For each patient, no adjustment in IST dosage and no new ISTs will be permitted for the first 
106 weeks, unless the patient experiences a relapse or a safety event, and a change in IST dose or 
regimen is deemed necessary by the Investigator to guarantee the patient’s safety.
 
Any changes in immunosuppressive therapy will be recorded in the source documents and e CRF 
page for concomitant medication.  
6.5.1.3. Standardized Treatment for Relapse 
The treatment of relapse is at the discretion of the Treating Physician. While the exact treatment for a potential relapse is ultimately at the discretion of the Investigator, the following 
standardized treatment regimen for a confirmed On -trial Relapse (Section  8.2.3.2) is 
recommended, in accordance with expert opinion:   
One gram (1 g) intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) administered daily for 3-5 days 
followed by oral prednisone tapering. 
• If the patient improves, then continue the trial assessments as per schedule of this 
protocol. 
• If there is no or minimal response to IVMP, or if the Investigator determines that PE/PP is the appropriate initial option, PE/ PP will be allowed at the discretion of the treating neurologist. Five cycles of PE, each removing 1.0 to 1.5 volumes of circulating plasma, 
are recommended for treatment of attacks that do not respond to IVMP. 
o If a patient undergoes PE/PP for an On -trial Relapse during the Treatment Period, a 
supplemental dose of study drug should be administered after each PE/PP as 
described under Supplemental Dose in Section 8.1.6.2. After receiving the 
supplemental dose, the patient will continue on the protocol-specified dosing schedule in the SoA (Section 1.3).  
6.5.2. Disallowed Medications and Therapies  
The following medications and therapies are prohibited during the study. 
• Mitoxantrone  
• Rituximab or other biologics that may affect immune system functioning (eg, 
tocilizumab, ocrelizumab, satralizumab, or inebilizumab)  
• Immunomodulatory therapies, including interferon beta-1b; interferon beta- 1a, glatiramer 
acetate, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, siponimod,  and 
fingolimod.

Alexion Confidential  7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG AND PATIENT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
In rare instances, it may be necessar y for a patient to permanently discontinue (definitive 
discontinuation) study drug. If study drug is definitively discontinued, the patient should remain 
in the study to be evaluated for the 8-week safety follow up visit. See the SoA for data to be 
collect ed at the time of discontinuation of study drug and follow-up and for any further 
evaluations that need to be completed. 
Patients will be discontinued from study drug if any of the following occur during the study: 
1. Serious hypersensitivity reaction;  
2. Severe uncontrolled infection;  
3. Use of disallowed medication as defined in Section 6.5.2; 
4. Pregnancy or planned pregnancy; or 
5. Sponsor or the I nvestigator deems it is necessary for the patient.  
See the SoA (Section  1.3 ) for data to be collected at the time of study drug discontinuation and 
follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
7.2. Patient Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
All efforts should be made to ensure patients are willing to comply with study participation prior 
to conducting the screening procedures. The study staff should notify the Sponsor and their site monitor of all trial withdrawals as soon as possible. The reason for patient discontinuation must 
be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. 
• A patient may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral 
compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. 
• At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an  early discontinuation visit 
should be conducted, as shown in the SoA (Section 1.3). Patients who discontinue early should be followed for safety for an additional 8 weeks and for any further 
evaluations that need to be completed. 
• The patient will be permanently discontinued both from the study drug and from the 
study at that time.  
• If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information,  the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
7.3. Lost to Follow -up 
If a patient fails to return, or is otherwise unavailable, for a scheduled visit within the acceptable 
visit window (Section  1.3), the site study staff must make a reasonable attempt to contact the 
patient to determine the reason for missing the appointment.  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 53 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  Patients who fail to return  for a scheduled visit must be contacted by the site’s study staff to 
determine the reason for missing the appointment. As it is vital to obtain any patient’s missing 
visit information to ensure the missed appointment was not due to an AE or potential rela pse, 
every effort must be made to undertake protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures. 
In the exceptional circumstance where a patient cannot or does not come to the study site for examination, the patient will be instructed to see his or her local neurologist or physician. In this 
event, if possible, the Treating Physician or designee will contact the local neurologist or physician to obtain as much information as possible about the patient’s medical and neurological 
condition, and provide clinical gu idance, if needed. The study site will obtain relevant medical 
records as documentation from the local physician’s examination and enter relevant data in the 
Relapse Evaluation Visit form or in the AE form as appropriate.  
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to c ontact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study. 
• Before a pat ient is deemed lost to follow up, the I nvestigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s 
medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered as lost to 
follow up. 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled  as part of Section  10.1.8.

Alexion Confidential  8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3 ). Protocol 
waivers or exemptions are not allowed. 
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the patient should receive study drug. 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
patients meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reason s for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol- specified criteria and 
were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA . 
8.1. General Assessments and Procedures  
8.1.1. Informed Consent  
The Investigator or qualified designee must obtain a signed and dated informed consent form 
from each patient prior t o conducting any study procedures. All efforts should be made to ensure 
patients are willing to comply with trial participation prior to conducting the screening procedures. 
8.1.2. Treating Physician 
The Treating Physician is the Principal Investigator (PI) /Sub -Investigator for the study who will 
be responsible for the overall patient management including patient eligibility evaluation, 
supervision of the study drug administration, recording and treating of AEs and monitoring of 
safety assessments.  
At the time of a relapse, the Treating Physician will perform a complete neurologic examination 
and determine if the patient's symptoms and signs meet the criteria for an On -trial Relapse 
(Section  8.2.3.2) . They may also treat the patient’s relapse according to the recommended 
On-trial Relapse Treatment regimen. Ultimately, treatment and treatment options for On -trial 
Relapse as well as any changes in the ISTs followi ng an On- trial Relapse are at the discretion of 
the Treating Physician.  
8.1.3. Medical History and NMOSD History  
The Investigator will review the patient’s history and diagnosis and document the following at 
the Screening Visit:  
• Medical history including all relevant medical/surgical history  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 55 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  • NMOSD diagnosis date as well as prior Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) that 
contributed to the diagnosis. Confirmation of the NMOSD diagnosis as defined by the 
International Panel for NMO Diagnosis (IPND) criteria (Section  10.5), including the 
specific criteria the patient met for the diagnosis. Only patients who are both anti AQP4 
Ab-positive and otherwise meet the 2015 IPND criteria will be eligible for participation.  
• Information about relapses which occurred before screening and that meet the protocol 
definition of Historical Relapse (Section  8.2.3.1) will be recorded. For relapses that 
occurred in the last 24 months, thi s information will include the following  
o The number of relapses (onset dates)  
o The clinical presentation of each relapse (eg, optic neuritis [ON], TM, brainstem, area postrema, or other) 
o Acute and maintenance treatments and dosing regimen s 
8.1.4. Vaccine and Anti biotic Prophylaxis 
As with any terminal complement antagonist, the use of ravulizumab increases the patient’s susceptibility to meningococcal infection ( N meningitidis ). To reduce the risk of meningococcal 
infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within the 3  years 
before or at the time of initiating study drug.  
• Patients who initiate study drug less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal 
vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2  weeks 
after vaccination.  
• Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with complement inhibitors (eg, 
eculizumab, ravulizumab). 
• Vaccines against serotypes A, C, Y, W135, and B, where available, are recommended to 
prevent common pathogenic meningococcal serotypes.  
• Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration 
should be given per official guidance and local practice on the appropria te use of 
antibacterial agents.  
• All patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and treated with appropriate antibiotics, if 
necessary.  
8.1.5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion  (Section  5.1) and exclusion (Section  5.2) criteria must be reviewed by the 
Investigator or qualified designee to ensure the patient qualifies for study participation. 
Both the Investigator and the Sponsor must approve patient eligibility before enrollment.

Alexion Confidential  8.1.6. Study Drug Administration  
This section describes the dosage regimen of study drugs. At the scheduled dosing visits 
(Section  1.3), study drug administration should be performed aft er all other tests and procedures 
have been completed, excluding the postdose blood sampling for PK and free C5. 
Refer to Section  6 for additional information on study drugs including preparation, handling, 
storage, and accountability. For detailed instructions, refer to the Pharmacy Manual. 
8.1.6.1. Ravulizumab 
Patients will receive a weight -based loading dose of ravulizumab via IV infusion on Day 1, 
followed by a weight -based maintenance dose on Day 15 ( Table  7), then once every 8 weeks 
(q8w) thereafter (Table  7). The entire treatment duration is up to approximately 4.5  years, when 
all patients complete the 2 -year Long- Term Extension Period or until ravulizumab is approved 
and/or available (in accordance with country- specific regulations), whichever occurs first. 
Patients may be switched from the 10  mg/mL to the 100 mg/mL formulation of ravulizumab 
with no change to the weight-based dose regimen during the Long- Term Extension Period.  
Table  7: Weight-based Doses of Ravulizumab 
 Body Weight (kg)a Dose (mg)  
Loading dose  ≥ 40 to < 60  2400

Maintenance dose  ≥ 40 to < 60  3000  
≥ 60 to < 100  3300  
≥ 100  3600  
a Dose regimen will be based on the last recorded study visit body weight. This will commonly be the current 
visit as weight will be measured prior to dose preparation on the day of the visit. If the study drug is prepared 
the night before a visit, the weig ht from the most recent prior study visit should be used.  
Depending on when a relapse occurs, ravulizumab scheduled dosing visits may or may not 
overlap with the Relapse Evaluation Visit and/or Follow -Up Relapse Evaluation Visits. 
Ravulizumab dosing should continue as scheduled during the Relapse Evaluation Period. 
8.1.6.2. Supplemental Dose  
During the study, PE/PP or IVIg will be allowed at the discretion of the Treating Physician for 
On-trial Relapse (Section  6.5.1.3).  
• If PE/PP is administered on a non -dosing visit as specified in the SoA ( Section  1.3), a 
supplemental dose will be administered within 4 hours after each session of PE/PP is completed, and will be based on the most recently administered ravulizumab dose (Table  8). 
• If PE/PP is administered on a scheduled dosing visit as specified in the SoA (Section  1.3 ), a ravulizumab supplemental dose will not be administered. Patients 
will receive their regular dose of ravulizumab (Section  8.1.6.1) 60- 120 minutes after 
that session of PE/PP is completed.  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 57 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  • It is noted that PE/PP is typically administered in multiple sessions over the course of 
1-2 weeks. If one session occurs on the day of a scheduled dosing visit, then the 
regular dose of ravulizumab is administered on that day. However, for the other 
sessions in the same 1 -2 week course that do not occur on the scheduled dosing visit 
day, only the supplemental dose will be given. 
• If IVIg is administered, ravulizumab supplemental dosing is only required after the last dose of IVIg in the series.  
− If the last dose of IVIg in the series is given on a non -dosing visit as specified in 
the SoA (Section 1.3 ), a supplemental dose of 600 mg ravulizumab will be 
administered within 4 hours after the completion of the IVIg infusion.  
− If the last dose of IVIg in the series is administered on the same day as a 
scheduled dosing visit as specified in the SoA (Section  1.3), then a ravulizumab 
supplemental dose will not be administered, and patients will receive their regular 
dose of ravulizumab (Section  8.1.6.1 ) 60-120 minutes after the completion of the 
IVIg infusion.  
Refer to Section  8.6.2 for PK and free C5 sample collection during On -trial Relapse.  
After receiving the supplemental dose, patients are to continue study drug infusion according to 
the protocol- specified dosing schedule (Section 1.3).

8.1.7. Visits at Home or Alternative Healthcare Facilities  
Patients may have an opportunity to receive study drug administration remotely at a medical facility that is located near the patient’s home or at the patient’s home with the permission of the 
Investigator in accordance wi th all national, state, and local laws or regulations of the pertinent 
regulatory authorities. Home infusions may be considered only for patients who have tolerated 
previous drug infusions well, without clinically significant infusion reactions, at the stu dy site. 
Remote visit options may be at the Investigator’s discretion and oversight, in accordance with the local regulations, and conducted by a qualified medical professional. Information about AEs, concomitant medications, and NMO signs or symptomatology must be sent to the Investigator’s 
site for evaluation on the day of the remote visit. In case of any signs or symptoms indicating an 
SAE or a potential relapse, the patient will need to be evaluated at the study site.

Alexion Confidential  Monitoring, treatment, and manageme nt of infusion reactions for patients receiving drug 
infusions at home are described in detail in the Nursing Instruction Manual and Section  10.14. 
8.2. Efficacy Assessments  
8.2.1. Neurologic Examination  
A complete general neurologic examination will be performed at the scheduled visits 
(Section  1.3) by the Tre ating Physician (Section  8.1.2) who is a study I nvestigator and has been 
properly trained as clinical evaluator, preferably the same Treating Physician, throughout the study. 
The complete general neurologic examination includes assessments of the following systems: 
mental status, fundus examination, cranial nerves, deep tendon reflexes, plantar responses, 
power/strength, sensation, coordination, and gait/balance. 
8.2.2. NMO Symptom Ca rd and Evaluation  
Before receiving the first dose of study drug at the Day 1 Visit, patients are given an NMO 
Symptom Card, which lists potential signs and symptoms of NMOSD relapse and contact 
information. 
At each visit throughout the study, study staff s hould ensure that the patient has the NMO 
Symptom Card. The Treating Physician will review and assess the patient for any signs or 
symptoms indicative of relapse. 
To minimize the risk of non-reporting or delayed reporting of a relapse when a patient is 
experiencing relapse symptoms, biweekly phone call visits will be implemented by study sites 
between the scheduled dosing visits (Section 1.3 ). A phone visit at Week 6, a scheduled non -
dosing visit, will not be necessary. At each phone visit, patients will be queried about safety and 
any neurologic symptoms suggestive of a relapse that are ongoing or that have occurred since the 
last visit. If a potentia l relapse is identified, the patient will be asked to have an onsite relapse 
evaluation visit to determine whether this patient’s symptomatology meets the protocol defined 
criteria for relapse.  
8.2.3. Relapse 
8.2.3.1. Historical Relapse  
Historical relapses are the relapses that occurred before the Screening Visit, including the first 
NMOSD attack. For this protocol, historical relapse is defined as a new onset of neurologic 
symptoms or worsening of existing neurologic symptoms with an objective change on neurologic 
examination (clinical findings or MRI findings, or both) that persisted for more than 24 hours and/or the new onset of neurologic symptoms or worsening of existing neurologic symptoms that 
required treatment. Treatment is defined as use of high -dose IV steroids, PE/PP or IVIg. Events 
that occur within a 30- day interval are considered as one relapse.

Page 59 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  8.2.3.2. On-trial Relapse  
8.2.3.2.1. Definition of On -trial Relapse  
On-trial Relapses are acute attacks that occur during the study treatment period. For this 
protocol, On- trial Relapse is defined as a new onset of neurologic symptoms or worsening of 
existing neurologic symptoms with an objective change (clinical sign) on neurologic 
examination that persists for more than 24 hours as confirmed by the Treating Physician 
(Section  8.1.2). The signs and symptoms must be attributed to NMOSD, ie, not caused by an 
identifiable cause such as infection, excessive exercise, or excessively high ambient temperature. Isolated changes on MRI or other imaging investigation with no related clinical findings are not considered an On- trial Relapse.  
8.2.3.2.2. Evaluation of On- trial Relapse 
On-trial Relapses will be monitored throughout the study. The Investigator or a qualified 
designee will review the signs and symptoms of a potential relapse with the patient in detail at each visit.  
Patients will be educated on the potential signs and symptoms of NMOSD relapse and will be instructed to contact the study site at the first sign or symptom of a potential relapse.  
Patients should be evaluated within 24 hours (and no later than 48 hours) of notification of signs 
or symptoms suggestive of a potential relapse. 
Evaluation of On- trial Relapses includes the following: 
• Complete  neurological examination to determine whether the clinical signs, 
symptoms and examination findings meet the definition of an On- trial Relapse  
• Assessment of relapse severity based on the OSIS (Section  8.2.9;  Section  10.10). The 
OSIS Visual Acuity  (VA) Subscale Scores will be used to categorize the severity of 
ON. The OSIS Motor Subscale Scores and Sensory Subscale Scores will be used to 
categorize the severity of TM.  
• Evaluation of the neurological functional systems based on the Kurtzke’s Functional 
System Scores (FSS) and the disability level based on the EDSS score (Section  8.2.5 ). 
• Ambulatory function assessment using the HAI (Section 8.2.8).  
• Ophthalmological examination including VA, confrontational visual fields (VF), and color vision (Section  8.2.10).  
• MRI +/ - gadolinium and/or optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations 
should be performed to evaluate a potential relapse as determined by the I nvestigator 
(Section  8.2.11).  
• Additional tests and the follow -up evaluation as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3 ). 
8.2.3.2.3. Treatment for On -trial Relapse 
At the time of a suspected relapse, the Treating Physician (Section  8.1.2 ) will perform a 
complete neurologic examination to determine if a patient is experiencing an On- trial Relapse. If 
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0

Alexion Confidential  the event is determined as an On -trial Relapse by the Treating Physician, treatment for relapse, 
as well as any changes in the ISTs following relapse, are at the discretion of the Investigator.  
The recommended standardized treatment for On -trial Relapse is provided in Section  6.5.1. 
Refer to Section  8.1.6 for administration of ravulizumab supplemental dose during an On- trial 
Relapse.  
8.2.3.2.4. On-trial Relapse Follow -up 
Relapse Evaluation Visits to monitor the course of the relapse will be performed according to the 
schedule specified in the SoA (Section  1.3). Additional (unscheduled) Follow- up Relapse 
Evaluation Visits outside the specified time points will be made at the discretion of the 
Investigator or the sub-I nvestigator.  
Following a relapse, a patient may continue in the trial if the patient and the 
Investigator/sub-Investigator decide that it is appropriate to continue to receive study drug. 
All reports of possible relapses and actions taken for the possible relapse must be documented in 
the patient’s source documents and recorded in the eCRF. 
8.2.3.2.5. Adjudication of On -trial Relapse  
On-trial Relapses will be independently reviewed by the Relapse Adjudication Committee 
(RAC), which consists of physicians who have particular expertise in NMOSD and will conduct 
independent reviews of all On- trial Relapses. The Committee will decide by majority vote 
whether each reported On- trial Relapse meets the objective criteria for an On -trial Relapse. A 
separate Charter will document all adjudic ation criteria and procedures for this study. 
8.2.4. Case of Interest  
Accurate identification of potential relapses is crucial for the scientific integrity of the study. In order to achieve this, the database will be analyzed for potential events (Cases of Interest) that 
were not reported by the Treating P hysician as a relapse.  
A Case of Interest is an event judged by the Treating Physician to not  be an On- trial Relapse (ie, 
it is not an Investigator confirmed On -trial Relapse), but which meets the following crite ria to be 
considered a Case of Interest and submitted to the RAC for adjudication: 
• Patients who were seen by the Treating Physician for a 24- to 48-hour relapse 
evaluation visit and where the T reating Physician concluded that an On- trial Relapse 
did not oc cur, OR  
• A sentinel AE (eg, AEs of weakness, sensory changes, especially in a dermatomal 
distribution, characteristic visual changes of NMOSD, or pseudo exacerbation of 
NMOSD) AND either:  
o An MRI was performed contemporaneously OR 
o Neurological symptoms were treated (by hospitalization or IVMP) OR  
o Contemporaneous objective worsening of the Treating Physician’s Neurologic 
Exam ination  (defined by answer of “worse” to clinically meaningful change 
question).

Alexion Confidential  Note : a Case of Interest is also referred to as a ‘pseudo relapse’. The terms may be used 
interchangeably. 
Refer to Section  10.15 for additional description of the Case of Interest identification proc ess. 
8.2.5. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  
The 10- point Neurostatus EDSS (modified Kurtzke EDSS), described in Section  10.6 , is widely 
used and accepted as a valid tool for quantifying disability and monitoring changes in disability 
over time (Kurtzke, 1983 ). 
The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10.0 in 0.5 unit increments. 
8.2.5.1. Expanded Disability Status Scale  
The total EDSS score is determined by 2 factors: gait and FSS (Section  8.2.5.2).  
• EDSS scores below 4.0 are determined by the FSS alone. 
• People with EDSS scores of 4.5 and above may have some degree of gait impairm ent. 
• EDSS scores between 4. 5 and 9.5 are determined by both gait abilities and the FSS. 
8.2.5.2. Functional Systems Scores  
A functional system (FS) represents a network of neuronal systems responsible for particular 
tasks/functions. The EDSS assigns a severity score to the patient's clinical status using FSS that evaluate dysfunction in the following 7 FSs (Section  10.6).  
The FS of functional systems 1 through 7 are scored on a scale of 0 (low level of problems) to 5 or 6 (high level of problems) to best reflect the level of disability observed clinically.  
8.2.5.3. EDSS and FSS Rater  
The EDSS and FSS should be administered in person by a trained rater. The EDSS Rater will 
perform a complete Kurtzke neurologic examination and document the FSS and the EDSS score. 
• The EDSS Rater shall not be the PI and cannot be directly involved in the trial 
patient’s management. When possible, the EDSS Rater should be a physician. If a non-physician EDSS Rater (eg, specialized nurse) will be used, the rater must be 
approved by the Sponsor before performi ng the assessments.  
• The EDSS Rater must remain blinded to all other study data as well as all other 
patient clinical data.  
• The blinded EDSS Rater will be responsible for performing the EDSS assessments 
throughout the study including at the time of a relaps e. When possible, the same 
blinded rater should perform the EDSS for each patient at visits specified in the SoA.  
• The EDSS Rater will perform a complete Kurtzke neurologic examination, as described in Section  10.6  and document the Functional Systems Scores (FSS) and the 
EDSS score (Kurtzke, 1983). 
For specific requirements for EDSS Rater qualification, refer to the training materials provided by the Sponsor.

8.2.6. EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ- 5D) 
The Euro Quality of Life (EQ- 5D) (Section  10.7 ) is a self -assessed, standardized instrument to 
measure health -related QoL, which has been used in a wide range of health conditions, including 
NMOSD (Schrag, 2000) . The EQ -5D consists of 2 pages: the EQ -5D descriptive system and the 
EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) (Section  10.7 ). EQ -5D should be administered prior to 
other study procedures at each visit. For patients who are blind, the script for face- to-face 
interview administration version of EQ -5D will be used (Section 10.7).  
8.2.6.1. EQ-5D Descriptive System  
The descriptive system is a 5 -component scale including mobility, self- care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each level is rated on a scale that describes the degree 
of problems in that area.  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 63 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  8.2.6.2. EQ Visual Analogue Scale 
The EQ -5D VAS is an overall health state scale where the patient selects a number between 0  to 
100 to describe the condition of their health, with 100 being ‘The best health state you can 
imagine’ and 0 being ‘The worst health state you can imagine’. 
This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the 
individual respondents. Previously published studies by EuroQol Group members showed 
preliminary evidence of the instrument’s feasibility, reliability and validity.  
8.2.7. Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
The SF-36 is a 36- item self- report of health -related quality of life (Stewart, 1988;  Ware, 1992) . It 
contains 8 subscales measuring different domains of health -related quality of life: physical 
functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, 
vitality, social functioning, role- limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The 
two summary scores are the physical component summary and the mental component summary. 
There is no single overall score for the SF -36. 
8.2.8. Hauser Ambulation Index (HAI)  
The HAI  (Hauser, 1983 ) is a rating scale developed to assess mobility by evaluating the time and 
degree of assistance required to walk 25  feet (Section  10.9). 
The Treating Physician or an appropriately trained designee  will perform the HAI test at the 
protocol specified visits (Section  1.3). 
• Patients are asked to walk a marked 25- foot course as quickly and safely as possible.  
• The examiner records the time and type of assistance (eg, cane, walker, crutches) needed. 
The rating scale also has categories for patients who are unable to walk.  
Although the patient's walking is timed, the time is not used directly but is utilized in conjunction 
with other factors to rate the patient on an ordinal scale with 10 gradations (Bethoux, 2011). This 
assessment will be performed for all patients in this study.  
8.2.9. Optic Spinal Impairment Score (OSIS) 
The OSIS is a scoring system for evaluating the severity of a relapse (Section  10.10). The OSIS 
VA Subscale Scores will be used to categorize the severity of ON. The OSIS Motor Subscale 
Scores and Sensory Subscale Scores will be used to categorize the severity of TM.  
The OSIS will be assessed at baseline and at the time of On -trial Relapse by the Treating 
Physician. Further instruction on OSIS evaluation of On- trial Relapse is provided 
in Section  8.2.3.2. 
8.2.10. Ophthalmologic Examination  
8.2.10.1. Confrontational Visual Fields  
Confrontational VF will be evaluated by the Treating Physician. It is critical for these 
assessments that the baseline ophthalmologic status be known so that changes in the examination 
can be used to evaluate prior or ongoing ON. Central scotomas are commo n in patients 
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021

Alexion Confidential  experiencing ON; however, visual field deficits can present with a broad spectrum of patterns 
(Keltner, 1999). 
8.2.10.2. Color Vision  
Color vision will be assessed by the Treating Physician or any appropriately trained designee using Ishihara Plates. Loss of color vision can be a marker of ON and is therefore an important 
assessment tool in NMOSD. Color vision will be assessed in this study using the first 21 Ishihara 
Plates.  
8.2.10.3. Visual Acuity  
Visual acuity is usually affected by ON, progressing over a period of hours to days. The Landolt 
C ring cha rt will be used to assess VA.  
The Landolt C consists of a ring that has a gap, thus looking similar to the letter C. The gap can be at various positions (usually left, right, bottom, top and the 45° positions in between) and the task of the tested person is to decide on which side the gap is. The size of the C and its gap are 
reduced until the patient makes a specified rate of errors. The minimum perceivable angle of the 
gap is taken as measure of the visual acuity.  
The Treating Physician or an appropriatel y trained designee will perform the VA test at the 
protocol specified visits (Section  1.3). 
• The test is performed at a distance of 4  meters or 13  feet.  
• The Landolt chart is typically recorded as acuity ratio distance (4  meters or 13  feet), so 
for normal VA it would be recorded as 13/13 or 4/4. Despite being assessed at a distance of 4 meters or 13  feet, sites can also report results using a denominator of  6 (for patients 
assessed in meters) or 20 (for patients assessed in feet). The appropriate score for each 
line using these denominators is indicated on the supplied Landolt C ring chart. In this 
case, a normal VA would be 
recorded as 20/20 or 6/6. Sites c an also choose to enter the score 
as a decimal, where a normal VA would be 1.0.  
• The test should always be done with the best possible correction (ie, wearing glasses) as needed and each eye should be tested independently. 
8.2.11. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Opt ical Coherence Tomography  
Baseline MRI of brain, cervical spine, and thoracic spine (contrast is optional) and OCT 
examinations should be performed. Exceptions may be granted (eg, based on a recent historical 
result being available for the study) if approved by the Alexion Medical Monitor. 
At the time of relapse, MRI of brain, cervical spine, and/or thoracic spine (contrast is optional) 
and/or OCT should be performed to evaluate a potential relapse at the discretion of the 
Investigator when deemed clinically relevant.  
Follow-up assessments should be performed promptly after On- trial Relapse if the Investigator 
decides these are indicated (Section  8.2.3).  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0

Alexion Confidential  8.3. Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.3.1. Physical Examinations  
• A complete physical e xamination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
following organs/body systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, lymph 
nodes, pulse, chest, heart, abdomen, extremities and musculoskeletal. 
• A targeted physical examination will include, a t a minimum, a body -system relevant 
examination based upon Investigator judgment and patient symptoms. 
• Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.  
• For consistency, all efforts should be made to have the physical examination 
performed by the same qualified study staff at each study visit.  
• Additional Physical Examinations can be performed as medically indicated during the study at the Investigator’s discretion.  
8.3.2. Height and Weight  
Body weight will be measu red in pounds or kilograms. Height will be measured in inches or 
centimeters.  
8.3.3. Vital Signs  
• Oral, temporal, or axillary temperature (°C or °F), pulse rate, respiratory rate (RR), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (mmHg) will be assessed. 
• Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed seated with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available.  
• Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the patient in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). Ideally, the same arm for each patient should be used for measurements.  
8.3.4. Electrocardiograms  
• Single 12- lead ECG will be performed at protocol specified visits in the SoA (see 
Section  1.3) using an ECG machine to obtain heart rate and measures of PR, QRS, 
QT, and QTc intervals. 
• Patients must be supine for approximately 5-10 minutes before ECG collection and 
remain supine but awake during ECG collection. 
• The Investigator or qualified designee will be responsible for reviewing the ECG to 
assess whether the ECG is within normal limits and determine the clinica l 
significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the source 
documents and the eCRF.

Page 66 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  8.3.5. Patient Safety Card 
Before the first dose of study drug, a Patient Safety Card will be provided to study patients to 
carry with them at all times. The c ard is provided to increase patient awareness of the risk of 
infections, especially meningococcal infection and promote quick recognition and disclosure of any potential signs or symptoms of infection experienced by study patients during the course of the study and to inform patients on what actions must be taken if they are experiencing signs or 
symptoms of infection. 
At each visit throughout the study, the study staff will ensure that the patient has the Patient 
Safety Card.  
8.3.6. Prior and Concomitant Medical Review  
It is important for Investigators or a qualified designee to review each medication the patient is 
taking before starting the study and at each visit. 
8.3.6.1. Prior Medications  
Prior medications and/or vaccines (including vitamins, herbal preparations, and those discussed 
in the exclusion criteria Section  5.2)  and non-drug therapies/procedures (any therapeutic 
intervention, such as surgery/biopsy or physical therapy) that the patient takes or undergoes 
within 30 days before the start of Screening or during the Screening Period before the first dose 
of ravulizumab, any meningococcal vaccine administered within the last 3 years, and any 
investigational drugs taken within a year of screening, will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF. Additionally, all medications or therapies ever used for relapse prevention or acute treatment of 
NMOSD (including steroids) before the first dose of ravulizumab must be collecte d. 
8.3.6.2. Concomitant Medications  
Use of concomitant medications and non-drug therapies/procedures (Section 6.5) will be 
evaluated during the study. At each visit, patients should be questioned about any new 
medication or non- drug therapies or changes to concomitant medications and non- drug therapies 
since the last visit. Concomitant medications and non-drug therapies should be recorded in the 
source documents and the patient’s eCRF.  
8.3.7. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
• See Section  10.2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA 
(Section  1.3) for the timing and frequency. 
• The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record 
any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected 
for the patient's condition. 
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug should be 
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 67 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  repeated until the values return  to normal or baseline or are no longer considered 
clinically significant by the Investigator or Medical Monitor.  
− If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor 
notified. 
− All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and the SoA. 
− If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory assessments 
performed a t the institution’s local laboratory require a change in patient 
management or are considered clinically significant by the I nvestigator (eg, SAE 
or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF. 
8.3.8. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring  
As the study drug is being evaluated for a neurologic indication, patients being treated with the study drug should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for suicidal ideation or behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior, especially at the beginning and end of the 
course of study drug, or at the time of dose changes. 
Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as intervention -emergent suicidal 
ideation and behavior will be monitored during this study using the Columbia -suicide severity 
rating scale (C -SSRS).  
There are 2 types of C -SSRS assessments that will be conducted during the study: C -SSRS at 
Baseline (Section  10.12 ) and C- SSRS -Since Last Visit (Section  10.13). C- SSRS will be 
performed by the Treating  Physician or an appropriately trained designee at visits specified in the 
SoA (Section  1.3 ) to ensure that patients who are experiencing suicidal t houghts or behavior are 
properly recognized and adequately managed or referred for further evaluation. Additional C -
SSRS assessments are permitted as needed.  
8.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The definitions of AEs and serious SAEs are specified in  Section  10.3. 
Adverse events will be reported to the Investigator by the patient (or, when appropriate, by a 
caregiver, surrogate, or the patient's l egally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study drug or study procedures, or that caused the patient to discontinue the study drug (see Section 7).  
For this trial, information about relapses that do not meet the SAE criteria (Section  10.3) should 
be recorded in source documents and in the eCRF as part of the Relapse Evaluation Visits and not reported as AEs. 
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 68 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  8.4.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF  until the last visit at the time 
points specified in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 1.3. The I nvestigator will 
submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a patient has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the study drug or study participation, the I nvestigator must promptly notify the 
Sponsor. 
8.4.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing  and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3 . 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.4.3. Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each patient at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and AEs of special interest (AESI; as defined in Section  8.4.6),  will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, 
or the patient is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3 ). Every effort will be made to 
undertake protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures. Further information on follow -up 
procedures is provided in Section 10.3. 
8.4.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
• Prompt notification by the Investigator to the S ponsor of a SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of patients and the 
safety of a study drug under clinical investigation are met. 
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study drug under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and I nvestigators.  
• Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) must be reported according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to I nvestigators as 
necessary.  
• An Investigator who receives an I nvestigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will

IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.4.5. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy testing must be performed on all WOCBP at protocol-specified timepoints in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). Pregnancy tests (urine or serum) may also  be performed at any time during the 
study at the Investigator’s discretion.  
A negative pregnancy test is required for WOCBP before study drug administration. 
• Details of all pregnancies in female patients and, if indicated, female partners of male patients  will be collected after the start of study drug and until the termination of the 
pregnancy. 
• If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in 
Section  10.4  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. Pregnancy alone is 
not considered an AE 
If a patient becomes pregnant, the study drug must be immediately discontinued, and the Sponsor 
must be notified as per Section  10.4. Each pregnancy will be followed to term and the Sponsor 
notified regarding the outcome. 
8.4.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Meningococcal infections will be collected as adverse events of special interest (AESI).  
8.5. Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, any dose of study drug greater than that specified in the protocol will be 
considered an overdose. 
Accidental overdose without any association with laboratory abnormalities or clinical symptoms 
should not be considered as an AE. Overdose must be reported by the I nvestigator within 
24 hours to the Sponsor regardless of its association with or without an AE. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. 
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should: 
1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.  
2. Closely monitor the patient for any AE/SAE.  
3. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined 
on a case -by-case basis).  
4. Docu ment the quantity of the excess dose as well as the timing of the overdose in the 
CRF.  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 70 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  Decisions regarding dose interruptions will be made by the Investigator in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the patient. 
8.6. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
• Blood samples for determination of serum drug concentrations and PD assessments will be collected before and after administration of study drug at the time points as 
specified in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for PK and PD assessments are optional at 
protocol specified timepoints (Section  1.3) and will only be obtained from patients 
who consent to CSF collection. 
• Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by the Sponsor. The actual date and time (24- hour clock time) of each sample will be 
recorded on the eCRF and the central laboratory requisition form. 
• Additional information on sample collection, including blood volume requirements, is provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
8.6.1. Sample Collection During the Study Period  
• Baseline (B) and trough (T) PK and PD blood samples will be collected at predose, within 90 minutes before administering study drug at visits specified in the SoA (Section  1.3). The predose blood sample may be drawn through the venous access 
created for the dose infusion, prior to administration of the dose.  
• Postdose (P) PK and PD blood samples will be collected postdose, within 60 minutes after completing study drug infusion. The postdose blood samples will be drawn from 
the patient's opposite, non-infused arm. 
• Blood samples at a non-dosing visit can be collected at any time.  
• In the event of an unscheduled visit, PK and PD blood sampl e will be collected as 
soon as possible. 
8.6.2. Sample Collection During On- trial Relapse  
Blood sample for PK and PD analyses will be collected at any time during the scheduled Relapse 
Evaluation Visit.  
However, if the relapse -associated blood sample collection s chedule coincides with a regular 
sample collection specified in the SoA (Section  1.3), the directions for regular PK and PD 
sample collection during the study (Section 8.6.1 ) should be followed. 
During On- trial Relapse, if the patient receives PE/PP and a supplemental dose of ravulizumab at 
the Re lapse Evaluation Visit, 3 blood samples for PK and PD should be collected at the 
following intervals:  
1. Approximately 5 to 90 minutes prior to PE/PP/IVIg  
2. After PE/PP/IVIg and before study drug infusion 
3. Within 60  minutes after  the completion of study drug inf usion  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0

Page 71 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  If a patient receives  PE/PP/IVIg  at any visit other than the Relapse -Evaluation Visit, blood 
samples for PK and PD will be collected immediately before and after each session of 
PE/PP/IVIg. A postdose sample, (ie, within 1 hour after completion of su pplemental study drug 
infusion), will also be collected.  
8.7. Genetics  
There are no prespecified genetic analyses in this study.  
8.8. Biomarker Research  
8.8.1. Exploratory Biomarker Research 
Blood samples for biomarker research will be collected from all patients at timepoints specified 
in the SoA (Section 1.3 ): 
CSF samples are optional samples for biomarker research and should only be collected from 
patients wh o have consented to CSF sample collection.

companion diagnostics re lated to the study drug target, disease process, pathways associated with 
disease state, and/or mechanism of action of the study drug. 
Samples may be stored for a maximum duration according to local regulations following the last 
patient’s last visit for the study at a facility selected by the Sponsor to enable further analyses. 
8.9. Immunogenicity Assessments 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to ravulizumab will be evaluated in serum samples collected 
predose (within 5-90 minutes prior to the start of infusion of study drug) from all patients 
according to the SoA (Section  1.3). 
Additionally, serum samples should also be collected at the final visit from patients who 
discontinued study drug or were withdrawn from the study. 
Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to ravulizumab and the titer of confirmed 
positive samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed to verify the st ability of 
antibodies to ravulizumab and/or further characterize the immunogenicity of ravulizumab. 
The detection and characterization of antibodies to ravulizumab will be performed using a 
validated assay method by or under the supervision of the Sponsor. Samples may be further characterized to determine the titer and the presence of neutralizing antibodies if deemed 
necessary. Samples may be stored for a maximum duration according to local regulations 
following the last patient’s last visit for the study at a facility selected by the Sponsor to enable 
further analysis of immune responses to ravulizumab.

Alexion Confidential  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
The time to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse will be evaluated using the log-rank test; the null 
hypothesis will be that there is no difference in the survival curves of the ravulizumab and the 
placebo treatment groups. The alternative hypothesis will be that there is a difference between 
the two survival curves, and ravulizumab is superior to placebo.  
The adjudicated On- trial ARR will be presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI) to provide 
an estimate of the adjudicated On -trial ARR for patients treated with ravulizumab. The null 
hypothesis will be that the mean adjudicated O n‑trial ARR is equal to 0.25 relapse/patient ‑year. 
The alternative hypothesis will be  that the mean adjudicated On-trial ARR is not equal to 0.25.  
For HAI the null hypothesis will be that the odds of a better outcome are the same between the 
ravulizumab arm and the placebo arm. The alternative hypothesis will be that there is a 
difference in the odds of a better outcome between the treatment arms and that ravulizumab has a higher odds of a better outcome. 
For the EQ -5D index and the EQ- 5D VAS, the null hypothesis will be that there is no difference 
between the distribution of the ravulizumab arm and the placebo arm. The alternative hypothesis 
will be that there is a difference between the distributi on of the treatment arms and that 
ravulizumab is superior to placebo. 
For the EDSS the null hypothesis will be that the odds of a worse outcome are the same between 
the ravulizumab arm and the placebo arm. The alternative hypothesis will be that there is a 
difference in the odds of a worse outcome between the treatment arms and that the odds of a 
worse outcome are higher in the placebo arm.  
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
This is an open -label, external placebo -controlled study to evaluate ravulizumab in NMOSD 
patients with the primary endpoint of time to first adjudicated On -trial Relapse. The placebo 
treatment arm in Study ECU -NMO-301 will serve as the external control. 
The sample size and power calculation assumptions for this study using the primary endpoint, time to first adjudicated On- trial Relapse , are as follows:  
• Log-rank test for comparison of ravulizumab to placebo 
• 47 patients in the placebo treatment group  
• Power 90% 
• Two-sided 5% level of significance 
• Drop -out rate 2-10% 
• Relapse- free rate of 92% for the ravulizumab arm at 12 months  
• Relapse- free rate of 63% for the placebo arm at 12 months  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 74 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  With these assumptions, a maximum sample size of approximately 55 patients in the 
ravulizumab treatment group provides at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference in time 
to first positively adjudicated On -trial Relapse.  
9.3. Populations for Analyses  
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: 
Table  10: Populations for Analyses 
Population  Description  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  All patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Safety Set All patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Per Protocol Set (PPS)  The PPS is a subset of the FAS, excluding patients with important protocol 
deviation s. The PP population will include all patients who: 
• Have no important protocol deviations or key inclusion/exclusion 
criteria deviations that might potentially affect efficacy,  
• Patients who took at least 80% of the required treatment doses while they were in the treatment period.  
Further details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Pharmacokinetic and 
Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set 
(PKPDAS)  All patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and who have at least one evaluable PK or PD result.  
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
The primary analysis will be conducted when all patients have completed the Primary Treatment 
Period. This analysis will include all efficacy, safety, PK/PD, and immunogenicity study data for 
regulatory submission purposes and will be the final analysis of the Primary Treatment Period. 
The original SAP to support the primary analysis was developed and finalized shortly after the original protocol was final. If necessary, a final SAP will be developed prior to the completion of 
the long-term extension period to describe any additional long- term efficacy and safety analyses. 
This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints and the safety analyses.  
Summary statistics will be computed and displayed by treatment group and by visit, where 
applicable. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will minimally include the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. For categori cal variables, 
frequencies, and percentages will be presented. Graphical displays will be provided as appropriate. All statistical analyses will be performed based on a 2 -sided Type I error of 5% 
unless noted otherwise. Missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise indicated in the 
described analysis in the SAP.  
Analyses will be performed using the SAS
® software Version 9.4 or higher.

Alexion Confidential  9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses 
To account for potential differences in baseline characteristics between the ravulizumab group 
and the external placebo control, sensitivity analyses of efficacy endpoints will include covariate 
adjustment methodologies, as warranted. Details are provided in the SAP. 
9.4.1.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is time to first adjudicated On -trial Relapse. The trial will be 
considered to have met its primary efficacy objective if a statistically significant difference 
(ie, p-value ≤ 0.05) is observed between the ravulizumab treatment group and the placebo group 
for the primary endpoint of the time to first adjudicated On -trial Relapse. The comparison of the 
treatment groups for the primary endpoint will use a log -rank test. Hazard ratio and risk 
reduction will be summarized from a Cox proportional hazards model. If there is no observed 
event in a treat ment arm, then Firth’s Penalized Likelihood ( Heinze, 2001) will be used to 
estimate the hazard ratio, risk reduction, and the profile likelihood 95% CIs. Confidence intervals 
(95%) will be presented for the estimated proportion of patients that are relapse -free at various 
timepoints (eg, Week 24, Week 48) based on the complementary log- log transformation. 
Kaplan -Meier curves for both treatment groups will be produced. 
Those patients who, for COVID ‑19‑related reasons as determined by the Investigator and 
documented in the eCRF (eg, infected with or exposure to COVID ‑19, quarantine, travel 
restrictions), received a dose of ravulizumab > 35 days late or missed a dose altogether will be censored at the time of the missed dose, if the missed or delayed dose occurred before the EOPT 
Visit or the first adjudicated On -trial Relapse.   To balance the evaluation period, patients in the 
placebo treatment group who were followed longe r than patients in the ravulizumab treatment 
group will be censored at the maximum time observed in the ravulizumab treatment group. Any relapses that had been observed among patients in the placebo group after that time will not be included in the primary analysis.  
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be described in the SAP.  
9.4.1.2. Secondary Endpoint(s)  
For those patients who, for COVID ‑19 related reasons as determined by the Investigator and 
documented in the eCRF (eg, infected with or exposure to COVID ‑19, quarantine, travel 
restrictions), received a dose of ravulizumab > 35 days late or missed a dose altogether, for endpoints involving the change from baseline, the change from baseline to the last value before the missed dose, if the missed or del ayed dose occurred before the EOPT Visit or the 6‑week 
Post‑relapse Visit, will be summarized and analyzed. 
9.4.1.2.1. Adjudicated On- trial ARR  
The adjudicated On- trial ARR will be presented showing the ravulizumab treatment group 
estimate and 95% CI from a Poisson r egression model in which the log of time in the study 
period will be used as the offset variable and historical ARR will be a covariate in the model. This endpoint will be considered statistically significant if the  2‑sided p ‑value is ≤ 0.05, and if 
the ad judicated On -trial ARR < 0.25 or if 0 relapses are observed.

Alexion Confidential  For those patients who, for COVID ‑19 related reasons as determined by the Investigator and 
documented in the eCRF (eg, infected with or exposure to COVID ‑19, quarantine, travel 
restrictions), rec eived a dose of ravulizumab > 35 days late or missed a dose altogether, any 
relapse that occurred during the time interval from the missed dose until the start of the next dose 
will be excluded from the ARR calculations and summaries.  
9.4.1.2.2. EuroQoL 5 Dimension ( EQ-5D) Index Score and EQ -5D VAS  
The change from baseline in the EQ-5D index score to the 6-week post- relapse/End of Primary 
Treatment Period time point (ie , for the placebo arm: 6 weeks post-relapse for the patients who 
have relapses, or Study ECU- NMO-301 end of study (EOS) for patients who did not have 
relapses; for the ravulizumab arm: the 6 week post -relapse visit for the first observed relapse for 
the pat ients who have relapses and the EQ -5D index score from the End of Primary Treatment 
Period visit for patients who did not have a relapse) will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA), in which the ranks of the change from baseline  will be the dependent 
variable, with treatment as a factor and the ranks of the baseline values as a covariate. Baseline is 
defined as the last available assessment prior to treatment for all patients regardless of their 
treatment group.  
The changes from baseline to the 6-week post- relapse/EOPT Period time point in EQ -5D VAS 
will be analyzed as described for the change in EQ -5D index score. 
9.4.1.2.3. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  
The change from baseline in the EDSS score to the 6 -week post -relapse/EOPT Period analysis 
time point will be calculated as described for the EQ -5D endpoints. For the EDSS, this change 
from baseline will be categorized into clinically important worsening (no worsening, clinical worsening). This endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regress ion model including treatment 
group and baseline EDSS as a covariate. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.4.1.2.4. Hauser Ambulation Index (HAI)  
The change from baseline in the HAI score to the 6 -week post- relapse/EOPT Period analysis 
time point will be calculated  as described for the EQ -5D endpoints. For the HAI, this change 
from baseline will be categorized into clinically important changes (clinical improvement, stable, 
clinical worsening). This 3 -level endpoint will be analyzed using a proportional odds model 
including treatment group and baseline HAI as a covariate. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.4.1.2.5. Accounting for Multiple Comparisons 
A closed testing procedure will be applied to control the type I error for the analyses of the 
primary and secondary endpoint s. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant in favor of 
ravulizumab, the secondary endpoints will be evaluated according to the following rank order: 
1. Adjudicated On- trial ARR  
2. Clinically important changes from baseline in ambulatory function as measured by HAI  
3. Change from baseline in EQ-5D index score 
4. Change from baseline in EQ- 5D VAS score

ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 77 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  5. Clinically important worsening from baseline in EDSS score  
The hypothesis testing will proceed from highest rank (#1) the adjudicated On- trial ARR to the 
lowest rank (#5) EDSS score, and if statistical significance is not achieved at an endpoint 
(p > 0.05), then endpoints of lower rank will not be considered to be statistically significant. 
Confidence intervals and p- values will be presented for all secondary efficacy endpoints for 
descriptive purposes, regardless of the outcome of the closed testing procedure. 
Additional information on multiple comparisons is detailed in the SAP. 
9.4.1.3. Tertiary/exploratory endpoint(s)  
Summaries and analyses of tertiary and exploratory endpoints will be described in the SAP. 
9.4.2. Safety Analyses 
All safety data will be summarized using the Safety Set.  
9.4.2.1. Analysis of Adverse Events  
The analysis and reporting of AEs will be based on treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
defined as AEs with onset on or after the first dose of ravulizumab. The incidence of TEAEs will 
be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, with additional summaries 
showing severity, relationship to study drug, TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and TEAEs resulting in death. Summaries of treatment- emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) 
will also be summarized by SOC and preferred term, with an additional summary showing relationship to study drug. These summaries will be presented by treatment group (ravulizumab, placebo).  
9.4.2.2. Analysis of Clinical Laboratory Parameters, Vital Sign Measurements and 
Electrocardiogram Parameters  
Laboratory measurements as well as their changes from Baseline at each visit and shift from 
baseline, if applicable, will  be summarized. ECGs, including ECG interpretation heart rate, PR, 
QRS, QT, and QTc intervals, and vital signs will also be summarized.  
9.4.2.3. Other Safety Analyses 
The number and percentage of patients in each of the C- SSRS categories as well as shifts from 
baseline will be presented.  
9.4.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group, using

medications; and any medication taken on or after the first dose of study drug will be considered 
as concomitant medications. Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized for all 
patients in the Safety Analysis Set, including ISTs for relapse prevention and acute relapse treatment. Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
(WHO Drug; the most current version available at the time of the analyses).  
9.4.7. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Anti -Drug Antibody Analyses  
Individual serum concentration data for all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ravulizumab 
and who have evaluable PK data will be used to derive PK parameters for ravulizumab.  
Graphs of mean serum concentration -time profiles will be constructed. Graphs of serum 
concentration -time profiles for individual patients may also be provided. Actual dose 
administration and sampling times will be used for all calculations. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for serum concentration data at each sampling time, as appropriate. Assessment of 
population-PK may be considered using data from this study or in combination with data from other studies. 
Pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed for all patients who receive at least 1 dose of 
ravulizumab and who have evaluable PD data. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for all ravulizumab PD endpoints at each sampling time 
(Section  1.3). The PD effects of ravulizumab will be evaluated by assessing the absolute values 
and changes and percentage changes from baseline in free C5 serum concentrations over time, as 
appropriate. Assessments of ravulizumab PK/PD relationships may be explored using data from 
this study or in combination with data from other studies. 
For assessment of immu nogenicity, the presence of confirmed positive ADAs will be 
summarized. Additionally, following confirmation of positive ADAs, samples will be assessed 
for ADA titer and presence of neutralizing antibodies.

Alexion Confidential  10.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting 
10.3.1. Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse Event Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occur rence in a patient or clinical study patient, temporally associated 
with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of 
study drug.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, 
not related to progression of underlying disea se). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may have been 
present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or a concomitant 
medication. Overdose per se will not be repo rted as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose 
taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of 
sequelae.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be reporte d as an AE 
or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the 
definition of an AE or SAE.  
 
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are 
associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than 
expected for the patient’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the patient ’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the 
start of the study that do not worsen.  
10.3.2. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 86 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  An SAE is defined as an AE that, at any dose:  
1. Results in death  
2. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, 
if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization signifies th at the patient has been detained (usually involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occu r during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the 
event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospita lization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an AE.  
4. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained 
ankle) which may interfere with or pre vent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the  above definition. These events should 
usually be considered serious.  
• Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
10.3.3. Recording and Follow -Up of Adverse Event and/or Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the  Investigator to review all documentation 
(eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE or SAE information in the CRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investi gator to send photocopies of the patient’s medical records to Alexion 
in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by Alexion. In this case, all patient identifiers, wit h the exception of the patient number, will be redacted on the 
copies of the medical records before submission to Alexion.  
• The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will 
be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and 
assign it to 1 of the following categories from National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, published 27 Nov 2017:  
• Grade 1: Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Grade 2: Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Grade 3: Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 87 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  • Grade 4: Life -threatening  
• Grade 5: Fatal  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the AE duration at e ach 
level of intensity to be evaluated. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each episode, if the severity of the intermittent event changes.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 o f the predefined outcomes as described in the 
definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and each occurrence 
of each AE or SAE. An Investi gator causality assessment must be provided for all AEs (both 
nonserious and serious). This assessment must be recorded in the eCRF and on any additional forms, as appropriate. The definitions for the causality assessments are as follows:  
− Not related (unrelated): There is no causal association with study drug  
− Related: There is causal (temporal) association to the study drug. Other conditions (concurrent illness, concurrent medication reaction, or progression/expression of 
disease state) do not appear to explain the event; the event corresponds with the 
known pharmaceutical profile; improvement on discontinuation; reappearance on 
rechallenge.
 
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying d isease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as 
well as the temporal relationship of the event to study drug administration will be considered and investigated.  
• This protocol will use the current Investigator’s Brochure as the Reference Safety Document. The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE will be determined by the Sponsor, based on the Reference Safety Document. The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) in 
his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigat or must  document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
− There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Al exion. However, it is very important 
that the Investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor or designee.
 
• The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light  of follow -up information and 
send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
 
Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements 
and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Alexion to elucidate the nature and/or 
causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a patient dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the 
Investigator will provide Alexion with a copy of any post -mortem findings including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to Alexion within 24 hours of receipt of the 
information.

Alexion Confidential  10.3.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting to Alexion or designee via an Electronic Data Collection 
Tool  
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Alexion or designee immediately and within 24 hours 
of awareness.  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to Alexion or designee will be the electronic data 
capture (EDC) tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable at the time that the Investigator or site becomes aware of an 
SAE, the site will use the paper Contingency Form for SAE reporting via fax or email. Facsimile 
transmission or email may be used in the event of electronic submission failure.  
- Email:  or Fax:  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.  
• When further information becomes available, the EDC should be updated within 24 hours with the 
new information and an updated SAE report should be submitted to Alexion Global Drug Safety 
(GDS).  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line 
to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study patient or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the 
site can report this information on a paper SAE form to Alexion GDS.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting to Alexion via Paper Report Form  
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Alexion or designee immediately and within 24 hours of 
awareness.  
• SAEs will be reported using the Safety Reporting Form and submitted to Alex ion GDS. The 
Investigator must complete, sign, and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information 
recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy via email or 
facsimile to the contact information provided belo w: 
− Email:  or Fax:  
−  
• Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should be entered into the eCRF and sent 
to Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator or study site staff becoming aware of this addit ional 
information via the reporting process outlined above.  
• For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following:  
− Appropriate and requested follow -up information in the time frame detailed above  
− Causality of the serious event(s)  
− Treatment of/intervent ion for the SAE(s)  
− Outcome of the serious event(s)  
− Medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information  
• All paper forms and follow -up information submitted to Alexion GDS must be accompanied by a 
cover page signed by the Investigator.  
• Paper source documents and/or reports should be kept in the appropriate section of the study file.

Alexion Confidential  10.4. Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information  
10.4.1. Definitions  
10.4.1.1. Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following me narche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study drug, additional evaluation should be considered. 
10.4.1.2. Women in the Following Categories A re Not C onsidered WOCBP  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
• For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the patient’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.  
− A high follicle stimu lating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement 
is required.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
10.4.2. Contracept ion Guidance : 
Before receiving study drug, female patients who consider themselves to be postmenopausal 
must provide evidence of postmenopause based on amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior to Day 1 
visit. Confirmatory serum follicle -stimulating hormone level (> 30 IU/L) may be obtained by the 
Investigator at screening. In the absence of 1 year of amenorrhea, multiple elevated FSH levels 
Protocol Amendment   Version 2.0  
ALXN1210 -NMO- 307  01 Sep 2021 
Page 90 of 126 
Alexion Confidential  will be required . The reason for not obtaining an FSH should be documented by the Investigator 
at the time of screening.  
Patients of childbearing potential must use a highly effective or acceptable method of 
contraception (as defined below) starting at Screening and conti nuing for at least 8 months after 
the last dose of study drug. 
Highly effective contraceptive methods include:  
1. Hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
2. Intrauterine device  
3. Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
4. Bilateral tubal occlusio n 
5. Vasectomized partner provided that the partner is the patient’s sole sexual partner  
6. Sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk associated with the study drug treatment; reliability of sexual abs tinence 
needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient  
Acceptable contraceptive methods include:  
A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicid e 
(double barrier methods)  
The above-listed method(s) of contraception chosen for an individual patient can be determined 
by the Investigator with consideration for the patient’s medical history and concomitant 
medications.  
Patients with a spouse/partner of childbearing potential or a pregnant or breastfeeding spouse or 
partner must agree to use double barrier contraception (male condom plus appropriate barrier 
method for the female partner) while on treatment and for at least 8 months after the last dose of 
study drug. Double barrier contraception is required even with documented medical assessment of surgical success of a vasectomy.  
Male patients must not donate sperm and female patients must not donate ova while on treatment and for at least 8 months afte r the last dose of study drug. 
10.4.3. Pregnancy Testing  
Patients of childbearing potential should only be included after a menstrual period and a negative 
highly sensitive serum pregnancy test. 
Additional pregnancy testing should be performed per the time points specified in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). 
Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected.

Alexion Confidential  10.4.4. Collection of Pregnancy Information 
10.4.4.1. Male Patients with Partners Who Become Pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male patient’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male patient is in this study. This 
applies only to male patients who receive study drug. 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female 
partner directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
Sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the 
estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
10.4.4.2. Female Patients Who Become Pregn ant 
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The initial Information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Outcome and Breastfeeding Form and submitted to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a patient's pregnancy. 
• The patient will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow -up information on the patient and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be 
required for longer than 3 months beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
• While pr egnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion (occurring at < 22 weeks 
gestational age) or still birth (occurring at >  22 weeks gestational age) is always 
considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post-study pregnancy 
related SAE considered reasonably related to the study drug by the I nvestigator will 
be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section  8.4. While the I nvestigator is not 
obligated to actively seek this information in former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
• Any female patient who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study drug, and each pregnancy will be followed to term and the Sponsor 
notified regarding the outcome.

Alexion Confidential  10.6. Appendix 6: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 
The Neurostatus EDSS (using the Kurtzke neurologic evaluation) is a method of quantifying 
disability in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The EDSS replaced the previous Disability Status Scales 
used in MS. 
The EDSS quantifies disabili ty in 7 Functional Systems (FS) and allows neurologists to assign a 
Functional System Score (FSS) in each of these. The FS are:  
• pyramidal 
• cerebellar  
• brainstem  
• sensory  
• bowel and bladder 
• visual 
• cerebral  
EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.0 refer to people with MS who are fully ambulatory. EDSS steps 4.5 to 9.5 
are predominantly defined by the impairment to ambulation. 
Neurostatus Expanded Disability Status Scale  
0 Normal neurological examination (all FS grade  0) 
1.0 No disability, minimal signs in one FS (one FS grade 1) 
1.5 No disability, minimal signs in more than one FS (more than one FS grade 1) 
2.0 Minimal disability in one FS (one FS grade  2, others 0 or 1) 
2.5 Minimal disability in two FS (two FS grade 2, others 0 or 1) 
3.0 Moderate disability in one FS (one FS grade 3, others 0 or 1) though fully ambulatory; or 
mild disability in three or four FS (three/four FS grade  2, others 0 or 1) though fully 
ambulatory  
3.5 Fully ambulatory but with moderate disability in one FS (one FS grade 3) and mild 
disability in one or two FS (one/two FS grade 2) and others 0 or 1; or fully ambulatory 
with two FS grade 3 (others 0 or 1); or fully ambulatory with five FS grade  2 (others 0 or

Alexion Confidential  10.14.  Appendix 14: Management of Potential Infusion- Associated Adverse 
Events During Study Drug Administration  
Intravenous and infusion -associated reactions are a potential risk with the use of mAbs; these 
reactions can be nonimmune or immune mediated (eg, hypersensitivity reactions). Signs and 
symptoms may include headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest 
tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, 
hypertension, lightheadedness, hypotension, palpitations, and somnolence. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions may include hives, swollen face, eyelids, lips, or tongue, 
or trouble with breathing.  
All administration -, IV- , and infusion -associated reactions will be reported to the Investigator 
and qualified designee. The Investigator and qualified designee are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of AE or SAE and remain 
responsible for following up events that are serious, considered related to the study drug, or study procedures; or that caused the patient to discontinue the study drug (Section 7 ).  
Definitions and procedures for recording, evaluating, follow-up, and reporting AEs and SAEs are outlined in Section  10.3. 
Patients who experience a reaction during the administration of study drug should be treated 
according to institutional guidelines. 
Patients who experience a severe reaction during administration of study drug resulting in 
discontinuation of study drug should undergo all scheduled safety, PK, and PD evaluations 
required by the protocol. The Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of any infusion reaction 
requiring interruption or discontinuation of study drug. All AEs that may indicate an infusion related response will be graded according to the CTCAE v5.0 or higher. 
If anaphylaxis occurs according to the criteria listed in Table  13, then administration of SC 
epinephrine (1/1000, 0.3 mL to 0.5 mL, or equivalent) should be considered. In the case of 
bronchospasm, treatment with an inhaled beta agonist also should be considered. Patients 
administered an antihistamine for the treatment or prevention of an infusion reaction should be 
given appropriate warnings about drowsiness and impairment of driving ability before being discharged from the center.

Alexion Confidential  Table  13: Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:  
• Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or bot h 
(eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula), and at least 1 of the following:  
o Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) 
o Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
• Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes 
to several hours):  
o Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)  
o Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze/bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)  
o Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
o Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
• Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):  
o Systolic BP of less than 90  mmHg or greater than 30% decrease from that patient’s baseline  
Abbreviations: BP  = blood pressure; PEF  = peak expiratory flow.

Alexion Confidential  10.15.  Appendix 15: Identification of Cases of Interest 
A Case of Interest is an event judged by the Treating Physician to not be an On- trial Relapse 
(ie, it is not an Investigator confirmed On -trial Relapse), but which meets the following criteria 
to be considered a Case of Interest and submitted to the RAC for adjudication: 
• Patients who were seen by the Treating Physician for a 24- to 48-hour relapse 
evaluation visit and where the T reating Physician concluded that an On- trial Relapse 
did not occur, OR 
• A sentinel AE (eg, AEs of: weakness, sensory changes, especially in a dermatomal 
distribution, characteristic visual changes of NMOSD, or pseudo exacerbation of 
NMOSD) AND either:  
o An MRI was per formed contemporaneously OR  
o Neurologic symptoms were treated (by hospitalization or IVMP) OR  
o Contemporaneous objective worsening of the Treating Physician’s Neurologic Exam ination  (defined by answer of “worse” to clinically meaningful change 
question). 
Cases of Interest involving a patient seen for a potential relapse where the Treating Physician 
concluded that an On- trial Relapse did not occur will be identified in real -time as they occur 
throughout the study.  
Additionally, periodically throughout the study, searching for sentinel AEs associated with neurologic changes on the Treating Physician’s Neurologic Exam ination, MRI, and/or treatment 
with hospitalization or IVMP will be done. This process will occur mid study, at 25% completion, 75% completion, and the end of the study. A meeting to review potential cases will be held and attended by at least one representative for Medical, Biostatistics, and Clinical 
Operations with optional attendance from Data Management. Events reviewed in this  meeting 
that do not meet the definition of a Case of Interest will be recorded along with a brief 
description of the reason they do not meet the criteria for a Case of Interest.  
Case of Interest Sentinel AE term identification  
Review of the AE term list to identify sentinel events will be done at least 4 times during the study. This list will be updated based on a review of SAEs, MRI indications, neurologic 
exam ination  changes and treatments associated with AEs. At the time the study is 80% complete 
a final review will be conducted to update terms and to search AEs again to identify all sentinel 
AEs in the search term list.  
The following AE terms are examples of ones to be flagged as sentinel AEs and used to identify Cases of Interest.  
The final list of AE terms will be maintained by Biostatistics in the SAS environment.

Alexion Confidential  10.16.  Appendix 16: Remote Source Data Verification During COVID -19 
Pandemic 
To ensure the rights, safety, and well-being of study patients, as well as the integrity of the trial 
and its data during the COVID-19 pandemic, when onsite study monitoring activities are 
restricted, remote source data verification (rSDV) may be employed wherever permitted by local 
regulations. 
Study ALXN1210- NMO-307 is a Phase 3, pivotal study in patients with NMOSD, a rare and 
devastating neurological disease. Alexion has assessed that the inability to complete ongoing 
SDV could pose a risk to the robustness of the study data. Delaying ongoing verification of key 
efficacy (primary and secondary) endpoints and important safety endpoints could result in late identification of incorrect or missing data, which could impact the integrity of the study data.  
Remote SDV will be carried out in written agreement with the Investigator and, if applicable, the 
institution, under conditions ensuring adequate data protection and patien ts’ rights. Depending 
on local regulation and agreement with the site Investigator and institution preference, rSDV 
may be conducted through direct and controlled read- only monitor access to institution electronic 
medical records systems, passive access to source documents via live image transmission, and/or 
sharing of redacted copies of source documents via a secure, validated, and access -restricted 
system. Regarding the electronic sharing of redacted copies of source documents, the following requirements must be followed:  
• Scanned or electronic documents to be uploaded (as PDF, jpeg, or other image 
format) that are of sufficient resolution to ensure readability, in black and white or 
color. 
• To ensure completeness of the shared content, the monit or will prepare a written 
request to the investigative site listing the source data needed to conduct rSDV and will perform a quality check on the list of documents shared by the site against the list of requested source data.  
• Site staff must perform a qua lity check ensuring source documents are redacted 
before making them available to monitors. A data breach management policy and a security team will be in place to identify violations and to ensure correct and timely 
action. 
• To prevent loss of or unauthori zed access to source data, investigative site personnel 
will need to actively grant access to their specific monitor. The monitor will only have viewing rights, thereby preventing loss, alteration, or download of source data. 
• Traceability of pseudonymized documents reviewed remotely will be kept by the 
monitor for verification onsite.  
The detailed scope of rSDV will be outlined in supporting study plans (eg, Clinical Monitoring 
Plan).  Conduct of rSDV will only be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Alexion Confidential  10.17.  Appendix 17: COVID -19 Risk Assessment  
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder can cause irreversible morbidity and even mortality, if 
untreated. As such, and due to the limited number of available treatment options, the benefit a 
patient may receive from joining an investigational study with a therapeutic treatment is potentially significant. The fact that Study  ALXN1210- NMO-307 is open- label and every patient 
is treated with ravulizumab also contributes to the potential benefit a patient may derive from participating in the study. Given that treatment for NMOSD does involve immunosuppression, there is a theoretical concern that the risk for infection may be higher than in patients not 
receiving immunosuppressants. However, there is no specific data to further inform this risk. The 
site In vestigator will therefore balance the risk/benefit considerations in the study patient taking 
these factors into account.  
The potential risks identified, and mitigation measures put in place in light of the COVID -19 
pandemic are provided in Table  15.

 During the time that the 
COVID -19 pandemic is active, 
Alexion will not open study sites or enroll new patients at 
sites unless the sites have the 
resourcing and capabilities to 
implement the study per 
protoc ol.

Alexion Confidential  Table  15: Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures due to COVID -19 
Risks Category  Summary of Data/  
Rationale for Risk  Mitigation Strategy 
Data quality and 
integrity  Lack of availability of site personnel to perform 
study assessments and capture study specific data in 
a timely manner and to maintain adequate quality standards. 
Lack of availability of site personnel to ensure adequate and continuous chain of custody, storage conditions, and monitoring for investigational 
product and biological samples.  
Inability of study monitors and quality personnel to conduct in- person visits to exercise adequate 
oversight of study execution at investigational sites.  
Missing data (COVID -19 pandemic may impact 
study visit schedules, and increase missed visits 
and/or patient study discontinuations inadvertently resulting in missing data [eg, for protocol -specified 
procedures]).  During the time that the 
COVID -19 pandemic is active, 
Alexion will only open study sites that report enough 
personnel capacity to 
sufficiently conduct clinical study -related activities.  
During this timeframe, site capacity will be reviewed by the 
site Investigator and th e study 
Medical Monitor prior to 
Screening. Each site is also 
evaluated for the capacity to 
perform remote monitoring visits and remote source data 
verification.  
During the time that the 
COVID -19 pandemic is active, 
it will be important to capture specific information in the eCRF that explains the reason 
the data is missing (eg, missed 
study visits or patient study discontinuations due to 
COVID -19).

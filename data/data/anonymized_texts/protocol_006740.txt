 2.  Study Schema 
 
Purpose:  To determine the effects of the anti -HIV pill Truvada on gene transcription in the 
upper and lower gastrointestinal tract  
 
 Design:  Open- label, cohort study  
 
 
Population:  HIV-negative men initiating HIV pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)  
 
 
Study size:  Up to 20  evaluable subjects  
 
 
Regimen:  Truvada (tenofovir plus emtricitabine) prescribed for daily use by participants’ 
primary care providers  
  
Duration:  Each subject will have an eval uation including blood draw, upper endoscopy and 
anos copy , with biopsies prior to initiating PrEP and approximately 2 months after 
initiating PrEP.   We will ask for confirmation of negative HIV test results 1- 2 
months after study completion.

 3.  Background and Rationale  
Current antiretroviral treatment ( ART) is extremely effective in controlling HIV replication and in 
many patients suppresses the number of virions measurable in peripheral blood to undetectable 
levels.  Nevertheless, whenever ART is stopped, HIV levels rebound due  to the reactivation of 
integrated HIV proviruses in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes [ 1].  During effective ART, it would 
theoretically require 60 years of treatm ent to eliminate the latent reservoir in T cells [2].   
 
Maintenance of the latent viral reservoir depends on viral silence and cellular proliferation.  
Some latently -infected cells do not express viral proteins and because of this silence escape 
immune system detection.  Proliferation of virally -silent cells then increases the host pool of viral 
DNA [3-5].  It is typically assumed that the maintenance of infection is entirely determined by 
characteristics of HIV itself and its effects on immune activation, so little attention has been 
given to the possibility that ART drugs  could contribute to viral latency.   
 
Tenofovir, a phosphonated nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ), is being 
considered for topical pre- exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP), so we conducted a comprehensive 
systems biology assessment of its impact on  the mucosa in MTN -007, a rectal microbicide trial 
[6-8].  Surprisingly, tenofovir’s effects bear potential relevance to HIV cure.  It strongly inhibited 
the transcription of many nuclear proteins, suggesting that it could contribute to silencing 
integrated HIV provirus.  The drug also inhibited the anti -inflammatory function of mucosal 
epithelial cells and stimul ated signatures of increased cell growth, suggesting that it could 
contribute to proliferation of latently -infected cells.   
 
These findings prompted our hypothesis that tenofovir, and perhaps NRTIs in general, have 
unappreciated effects on HIV latency, and may in fact prevent HIV cure by promoting the 
survival of cells with integrated provirus .  Thus, effectively suppressing HIV with an NRTI -free 
regimen could have curative potential.   
 
An important step for investigating this hypothesis is the determinat ion whether tenofovir’s 
inhibition of anti -inflammatory immunological function observed after topical use extends to oral 
administration.   Drug levels in the rectum are lower after oral dosing than topical application [9, 
10], but the cumulative effect of longer -term oral treatment likely leads to similar funct ional 
consequences .  To investigate the effect of o ral NRTI treatment on  gut immune homeostasis, 
we plan to perform global transcriptome analysis using similar mRNA expression microarrays as 
in MTN -007, as well as digital droplet PCR analyses for specific anti -inflammatory genes such 
as IL -10, in a cohort of Seattle MSM who give rectal biopsies before and after three months  of 
oral PrEP with Truvada.  Samples will also be tested for active NRTI drug levels.   
 
We plan to compare findings in the rectal mucosa to findings in duodenal biopsies, because 
drug co ncentrations after oral medication are expected to be higher in the upper GI tract than in 
the rectum.  The small bowel has been implicated as an important site for harboring residual 
HIV provirus during suppressive ART [11, 12], which is somewhat paradoxical, since high ART 
concentrations should in theory restrict the size of the viral reservoir.  Determining NRTI drug concentrations and the drugs’ transcriptional effects in the duodenum –  both has never been 
done before - may help to resolve this paradox.   
 For comparative purposes, we plan to perform similar studies with peripheral blood cells.   
 Lastly, NRTIs are mutagenic to E. coli  [13, 14].  In conjunction with their broad trans criptional 
effects, as uncovered by our studies (see above), this implies that NRTI drugs may also change 
6 
 the composition of the gut microbiome.  By disrupting the gut microbiome and causing pro -
inflammatory gene expr ession changes [15], tenofovir/emtricitabine may further perturb gut 
immune homeostasis.  Altered immune homeostasis could then feed back to alter the gut 
microbiome, because a disruption of the mucosa’s tolerogenic response to GI commensal 
bacteria could compromise the protective immunological niche that commensals need to thrive 
[16].  For these reasons we will also obtain cytobrushes from the rectal and duodenal mucosa to 
analyze the gut microbiome by 16S rRNA gene sequencing  on the Illumi na Miseq platform.

 7.  Study Regimens  
Truvada (tenofovir  300mg + emtricitabine 200mg) for daily use will be prescribed by the 
participant’s primary care physician.  All prescription refills and monitoring will occur through that 
mechanism.  
 
8.  Concomitant Studies and M edications  
Subjects will be allowed to participate in any other HIV research study as long as all protocol -
specified evaluations can be performed and the other study does not prohibit participation or 
provide medications that interact with Truvada.  
 
PEP 
Participants seeking PEP will be referred to their PCP or to the Madison Clinic at Harborview. If 
subjects receive PEP, they will not be eligible for the follow -up procedures.  
 
 
  
10 
 9.  Data Collection and Analyses  
All blood (except for routine blood work and HIV testing) and tissue specimens will be 
transported to the Hladik Laboratory.  Venipuncture specimens can be transported at room 
temperature. Biopsy specimens should be collected in RNA later (n=2), formalin (n=1), and in 
empty tubes (n=2) and transported on ice.  
 
RNA expression studies will be performed in the Hladik Lab using Illumina 24- plex microarray 
hybridization chips.  Drug levels in blood and tissue cells will be measured by mass  
spectrometry in the laboratory of Dr. Craig Hendrix at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.  
Microbiome sturdies will be done in the laboratory of Dr. David Fredricks.  Samples for these 
analyses will be distributed and shipped to the Hendrix and Fredri cks Labs from the Hladik Lab.  
All specimens sent from the clinic to the Hladik Lab, and then on to the Hendrix and Fredricks 
Labs, will be de- identified, i.e., specimen labels and accompanying information sheets will not 
allow the PI or any laboratory mem bers to identify the study subjects.  Communication with 
study subjects will only be done by clinic personnel.   
 All tests and data analyses will be performed for research purposes only.  All experimental data 
will be  analyzed by the Hladik Group, with help from collaborator Dr. Paul Edlefsen, a bio-
mathematician with experience in high dimensional data analysis.   
 
Microarray data will be analyzed by standard statistical tools available from the Bioconductor 
Suite in R as described in detail previously [ 15].  Microarray findings may be confirmed by 
immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections, also performed and analyzed in the Hladik 
Lab.   
 
Drug levels will be measured by mass spectrometry and analyzed as described in detail in 
previous publications [ 17-19].   
 
Microbiome data will be identified to species and genus levels by high- throughput, multiplexed 
16S targeted amplicon sequencing on a M iseq platform by 16S rRNA targets to normalized and 
pooled librari es (performed by GeneWiz ).   
 
To confirm gene expression data, we may perform  a number of follow -up tests  with the 
samples , including : (1) immunohistological staining of tissues;  (2) flow cytometric analysis of 
blood and tissue cells;  (3) proteomics assays with lysed tissue cells, cytobrush supernatants, 
lysed blood cells, and blood plasma .  We will not perform genetic DNA testing and we will not 
establish permanent cell lines from the samples.

 13.  Human Subjects Considerations  
Human subjects application 
This project and all materials  will be reviewed and approved by the UW Human Subjects 
Division prior to conduct of the study and in annual progress reports if the project continues 
beyond the one year study per iod.  Written informed consent will be obtained from all study 
participants.  
 
Procedures  
Endoscopy: The specific procedural  risks of EGD with biopsies are bleeding, infection, 
perforation, and adverse reacti on to the sedating medications.  We quote risk of any of these 
happening to be less than 0.01%.    
 
Anoscopy : Risks of anoscopy with biop sies are highly uncommon but could include mild to 
moderate discomfort, bleeding, or infection.   Participating in receptive anal intercourse after 
anoscopy might lead to an increased risk for transmission of HIV . Participants will be advised to 
avoid receptive anal intercourse for the 24 hours prior to anoscopy and to use condoms for 
receptive anal intercourse for 7 days after anoscopy or until no blood is found.  
 
Confidentiality  
All study -related information will be stored securely at the study site.  All participant information 
will be stored in locked file cabinets in areas with access limited to study staff.   
 
As part of the study, subjects will be given a study -specif ic code (e.g. Initials -####).  All study -
specific  laboratory specimens, reports, study data collection, and administrative forms will be 
identifie d by this study  code.   
 
All records that contain names or other personal  identifiers (e.g. consent forms, contact 
information) will be stored separately from study records identified by code number.  All local 
databases will be secured with password- protected access systems.   
 
Communicable disease reporting 
HIV is exempt from reporting requirements in the state of Washington as long as persons 
diagnosed with HIV are referred to One on One or their primary care providers for care .  
Participants will be made aware of all reporting requirements during the study informed consent process.

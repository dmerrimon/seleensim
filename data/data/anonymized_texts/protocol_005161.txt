LY4501902.Synopsis
Study Rationale
Currently there are a limited number of therapiesapproved for the treatment of children with 
pulmonary arterial hypertensio n (PAH); bosentan ( United States [ US]and European Unio n 
[EU]) and sildenafil ( EU).  There is a growing body  of evidence, however, supporting the use of 
therapies approved in the adult populat ion with PAH that has led to widespread off -label use in 
this pediatric populat ion.  There continues to be, however, a need for robust data to inf orm 
prescribing physicians regarding the safet y and efficacy o f all treatment options, including 
tadalafil, in the pediatric PAH population.
This is the first Phase 3 study  of tadalafil for use in treating PAH in pediatric pat ients.

LY450190Study Design:   A Phase 3, international, randomized multicenter, 2 -period, double -blind, placebo -controlled, add -
on (in addition to the patient’s current endothelin receptor antagonist [ERA]) study to evaluate tadalafil efficacy, 
safety, and population PK in pediatric patients with PAH.
Screening and eligibility evaluation will be performed during an approximately 28 -day period prior to 
randomization and the administration of tadalafil.  Period 1 is a 24 -week study drug treatment phase. During this 
study period, patients will continue to receive stable ERA therapy.  Period 2 is an open -label extension (OLE) 
period that will evaluate the long -term safety of tadalafil while providing continued access to tadalafil for pediatric 
patients completing Period 1 .  Patients entering Period 1 of the study will be stratified into 1 of 3 weight cohorts 
based on their weight at the time of the screening visit (heavy -weight: ≥40 kg; middle -weight:  ≥25 kg to <40 kg;

LY450190Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Primary Measures (Period 1) :
The primary efficacy measure is 6MWDin meters assessed in a subset of patients ≥6 to <18 years of age 
who are developmentally capable of performing a 6MW test .
Secondary Measures (Period 1) :
Time to CW and the incidence of CW.
Secondary Measures (Period 2) :
Incidence of and time to CW.
Additional Measures (Period 1) :
WHO functional classification
Cardiac MRI parameters:
-LV ejection fraction
-RV end diastolic volume
-RV end systolic volume
-RV ejection fraction
Echocardiography parameters:
-tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)
-eccentricity index
-pericardial effusion
-maximal tricuspid regurgitant velocity
NT-Pro-BNP concentratio ns.
Additional Measures (Period 2) :
6MW distance in meters measured in patients who are ≥6years of age and who are developmentally 
capable of performing a 6MW test.
WHO functional classification
Safety:  Period 1: Safety during Period 1 will be assessed through AEs including abnormalities detected by ECG or 
physical examination, clinical chemistry and hematology panels, urinalysis, vital signs, and eye examinations.  
Period 2:  AEs, changes in body wei ght and height, inhibin B biomarker (male patients only), eye examinations, 
Tanner scale, and intelligence tests, and concomitant medications.  
Health Outcomes :
CGI-I, CHQ-PF28 (in patients ≥5yearsof age).
Pharmacokinetics :  Population PK assessment of plasma tadalafil concentrations at steady -state.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 7
LY450190Statistical Methods: Results of statistical hypothesis tests will be reported using 2 -sided p-values, unless 
otherwise specified for a particular endpoint. 
Sample Size : At least 34patients will be stratified by weight and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tadalafil or placebo 
treatment in this study (17 to placebo treatment and 17 to tadalafil treatment).  
With 2 patient snot having postbaseline 6MWD,a sample size of 32 randomized patients is assumed to be ≥6 to 
<18 years of age who are developmentally able to complete the 6MW Dtest.  This sample size will provide 71% 
power to detect a placebo -adjusted mean difference in change in 6MWD of 40 meters with a standard deviation of 
60 metersand a two -sided significance level of 0.2.  
Efficacy:  Efficacy analyses of Period 1 data, except 6MW measurements, will include all patients who were 
randomized and took at least 1 dose of study medication.  The analysis of 6MW data will include only the subset of 
randomized patients ≥6 to <18 years of age wh o took at least 1 dose of study medication and were capable of 
performing a 6MW test. Changes from Day 1 to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in 6MW distance will be analyzed 
with a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM).
Change from Day 1 of Perio d 1 in 6MW distance and WHO functional class will be reported for all patients who 
participate in Period 2.
The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in 6MW distance will be analyzed using a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). Terms in th e model will include visit, baseline 6MW measurement, PAH etiology, 
type of ERA therapy, and treatment group.
The proportion of patients who experience a change in WHO functional class will be summarized.   Changes will 
also be categorized as “worsening, “n o change,” or “improving” over the study period.  The percentages of patients 
in these categories will be summarized by treatment groups .
Aninterim analysis of 6MW data is planned in approximately Q1 2017 when approximately 50% of all 
randomized patients (Period 1) have baseline and Week 24 6MWmeasurements available for analysis.   The results 
of this interim analysis will be reviewed by a data monitoring committee (DMC) to assess evidence of efficacy and 
the accuracy of study design assumptions.
The database will be locked ,and data collected during Period 1 will be analyzed when all randomized patients 
have ended participation in Period 1.  These results will be reported in a clinical study report.  An addendum to the 
initial clinical study report will be prepared at the conclusion of Period 2 to present analyses of the OLEdata.
Changes from Day 1 to endpoint in hemodynamic parameters collected via echocardiogram and MRI will be 
analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models.  Similarly, c hanges in log -transformed NT -Pro-BNP 
values will be analyzed with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model.
Safety:  The analy sis of safety  will include all patients who took at least 1 dose of study medication. The 
differences in the percentages of patients experiencing AEs across various criteria (for example, treatment -
emergent, treatment -related, serious, etc.) will be summarized.
Changes from Day 1 in clinical laboratory measurements, biomarker (inhibin B) concent rations, blood pressure, 
and heart rate (HR) will be analyzed with ranked ANOVA models with a term for treatment group. Differences in 
categorical changes will be summarized.
Changes from Day 1 in composite intelligence scores will be assessed according to the published instructions for 
each instrument.  The numbers and percentages of patients in each treatment group with shifts in Tanner stage at 
Year 1 and Year 2 will be summ arized.  
Health Outcomes :  An ANCOVA analysis will be used to examine changes from Day 1 to Weeks 16 and 24 in 
CHQ-PF28 scores.  Patient outcome will be assessed using the CGI -I at Weeks 16 and 24 (Visits 7 and 9) using an 
ordinal scale with 7 response ca tegories ranging from “Very Much Better” to “Very Much Worse”.  Responses will 
also be grouped into 3 derived categories (“Worse”, “No Change”, and “Better”) for additional analysis.  The 
proportion of patients in each of the 7 response categories and each of the 3 derived categories will be summarized 
by treatment group.  
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 8
LY450190Pharmacokinetics :  Plasma tadalafil concentration -time data will be pooled and evaluated using a population PK 
approach.  The effects of body weight, age, and sex on apparent clearance (CL/F) will be explored.  If the number 
of patients taking different types of ERA is sufficient to quantify the effect of ERA on apparent clearance, then this 
will also be done.  Due to random PK sampling times and the low number of samples available from each 
individual patient, it may be necessary to combine the data from this study with the densely sampled data from 
Study LVIG to better characterize the population PK of tadalafil in this patient population.

adverse event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and

LY450190A Double-Blind Efficacy  and Safety  Study of the 
Phosphodiesterase Ty pe 5 Inhibitor Tadalafil in Pediatric 
Patients with Pulmonary  Arterial Hy pertension
5.Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertensio n (PAH) is a rare, chronic and progressive disease characterized 
by elevated pulmo naryartery pressure and pulmo nary vascular resistance, leading to right -heart 
failure and death (Rich 1998; Barst 2004).  PAH can be further classified into idiop athic PAH, 
heritable PAH, and associated PAH.  Conditions that are associated with PAH include 
connective tissue diseases (particularly systemic sclerosis and lupus), congenital heart disease, 
portal hypertensio n, human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) i nfection, and so me drugs 
(particularly anorexi gens).
Therapies that are currently approved for the treatment of PAH in adults, in various geographies 
around the world, include prostacy clin and its analogues (epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, and 
beraprost), the endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) (bosentan and ambrisentan), and the 
phosphodiesterase ty pe 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil).
While PAH is more commo n in the adult populat ion, it does occur in children with a similar, if 
not worse, prognosis wit hout treatment.  However, with treatment the outcome appears better in 
children than in adult s.  Due to limited clinical data in children, treatment decisio ns are 
extrapolated from adult studies. Similar clinical strategies fro m adults have been suggested for 
the management of PAH in children ,but these guidelines must be used wit h caution 
(McLaughlin et al. 2009a).  Currently, bosentan isthe only approved drugfor the treatm ent of 
pediatric patients with PAH in the United States (US).  In the European Unio n (EU), bosentan 
and sildenafil areapproved for the same pediatric indicat ion.  There is a growing body  of 
evidence supporting the use of therapies approved in adults that has led to widespread off -label 
use (Beghetti 2009).  There is a nee d, therefore, to provi de physicians wit h safety and efficacy  
results of all treatment options, including tadalafil, in the pediatric populat ion.
Tadalafilis an orally administered, potent, and selective PDE5 inhibitor that has been 
investigated at doses of 2.5 mg to 100 mg (predominant ly in adult m en at doses of 10 mg and 
20mg on-demand, and 2.5 mg and 5 mg taken once daily).  Tadalafil is current ly approved in the 
US, EU, and Japan for the treatment of erectile dysfunct ion (ED), both on -demand and once 
daily.  Tadalafil is the active ingredient of Adcirca ®, that was recently approved for the treatment 
of PAH (pulmo nary hypertensi on Group 1) in adults in the EU, US, Canada, and Japan.  
Tadalafil was also approved for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the US.
PAH is associated with impair ed release of nitric oxide (NO) due to little or no expressio n of NO 
synthase in the vascular endothelium o f pulmonary arteries (Giaid and Saleh 1995).  PDE5 is the 
predominant phosphodiesterase isoenzyme in the pulmo nary vasculature.  As such, PDE5 
inhibition potenti ates the ni tric oxide-mediated pulmo nary vasodilator and antiproliferative 
effects in patients (adults and children) with PAH.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 21
LY450190The safety and efficacy  of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in adults have been investigated in a 
16-week placebo controlled study  (Study H6D-MC-LVGY [LVGY]) which demonstrated that, 
tadalafil 40-mg once-daily dosing is effect ive in the treatment of adult patients with PAH and is 
associated with an increase in exercise capabilit y.  Tadalafil 40 mg was well tolerated in the 
adult PAH pati ent populati on with a safety profile similar to that observed in the ED patient 
population.
There is limited experience wit h regards to the safety , tolerability, and efficacy of tadalafil in 
pediatric PAH pat ients.  A recent report on ta dalafil in children with PAH has demonstrated that 
tadalafil was well -tolerated in this pat ient population (Takatsuki et al. 2012).  In a company -
sponsored clinical trial, a single 14 -year-old female pati ent (73 kg) received tadalafil 2.5 mg in 
Study LVGY.  This patient completed Study  LVGY and subsequently enrolled in the extensio n 
Study H6D-MC-LVGX (LVGX), in which she received tadalafil 40 mg.
It has been suggested that the clinical course of PAH in children is less predictable than in adult s.  
If untreated, the condit ion may progress more rapidly in children, leading to reduced survival in 
children than in adult s over time.  Importantly , the safet y and efficacy o f PAH therapies 
approved for adults have not been robustly established in pediatric patients due to limited data in 
children.  Given the efficacy and safet y results of tadalafil for the treatm ent of PAH in adults 
(Study LVGY), and recogni zing the importance of providing prescribers and pat ients with 
recommendat ions reflecting tadalafil experience across developmental stages, Lilly is pursuing 
the development of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in pat ients, aged ≥6months to <18 years.
This study , H6D-MC-LVHV (LVHV), is a phase 3, internat ional, rando mized, double -blind 
(Period 1), placebo-controlled (Period 1) add -on (in addit ion to the pati ent’s current ERA) study  
to explore the efficacy, safet y, and populat ion pharmacokinet ics (PK) of tadalafil administered 
orally once daily  in children wi th PAH.  Pati ents will receive study  drug for 6months inthe 
double-blind period (Period 1), and will then be eligible to enroll into an open -label 2-year 
extension period (Period2). 
Study LVHV will include children who, at the time of screening, are ≥6months of age and 
<18years of age.  Patients will be st ratified into 3 weight cohorts (Heavy -weight, ≥40kg; 
Middle-weight, ≥25kg to <40 kg; and Light -weight, <25kg), and then rando mized to tadalafil or 
placebo.  The dose of each weight cohort in this study will be established and may  be redefined 
based on s afety monitoring committee (SMC) and Sponsor review o f the PK and safet y results 
from Study H6D-MC-LVIG (LVIG).  Study  LVIG is an open -label, multiple ascending- dose 
study to evaluate the safet y and PK of tadalafil administered orally as a tablet or suspen sion to 
children with PAH. Study LVIG includes 2 study  periods: PK/safet y (Period 1) and an open -
label safet y extension (Period 2).  The primary  objective of Peri od 1 of Study  LVIG is to 
characterize the PK o f tadalafil in a pediatri c populati on with PAH.The object ives of Period 2 
are to evaluate the long -term safety of tadalafil as well as clinical  worsening (CW) of PAH in 
this patient population.
The study  design for thi s study was developed to treat pediatric patients who are on stable PAH 
therapy of an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) as standard of care instead of PAH

LY4501907.Investigational Plan
7.1.Summary of Study Design
FigureLVHV.7.1illustrates the study  design and the respect ive study periods. The Study  
Schedule is in Attachment 1.
This is a Phase 3, internat ional, randomized mult icenter, 2-period, double -blind (Period 1), 
placebo-controlled (Period 1), add -on (ie, in addit ion to the patient’s current ERA) study  to 
evaluate the efficacy , safety, and population PK of tadalafil in pediatric patients with PAH.
Study LVHV will enroll pediatric PAH pat ients ≥6months to <18 years of age with WHO 
functional class II or III ( Attachment 8) andwho are already receiving treatment with an ERA.  
Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or active drug in a 1:1 ratio, based on 
weight cohort, PAH eti ology, and type of ERA.  Patients will receive study  treatmentfor 
6months in the double -blind period (Period 1), and then will be eligible to enroll into an open-
label 2-year extension period (Period 2) during which pat ients will receive tadalafil.
At least34 patients will be rando mly assigned to treatment in Peri od 1 of thi s study.  To achieve 
a representative distribut ion of patients’ ages, enrollment will be monitored throughout the study  
to achieve ≥30% of all patients < 12years of age.
Patients entering the study  will be stratified into 1 of 3 weight -cohorts,based on the patient’s 
weight at the time of the Screening visit:
Heavy-weight:  ≥40kg
Middle-weight:  ≥25kg to <40 kg
Light-weight:  <25 kg
If a patient’s weight changes during Period 1, such that he/she falls into a different weight 
cohort, he/she wil l continue to receive the study  drug dose appropriate to his/her original weight 
cohort.
Patients will also be stratified by  type of ERA (bosentan or other) and PAH etiology .
If a patient will be part icipating in Period 2, and if that patient’s weight chan ges at the concl usion 
of Period 1 (at the Visit9 or Early Terminat ion visit) or during Period 2, such that he/she falls 
into a different wei ght cohort (defined as at least 1 kg above or below the weight cohort 
thresholds of 25 kg and 40 kg), then the patient’s dose of study  drug may be adjusted so that they  
are receiving the appropriate weight cohort -related dose.
Dose selection for this study will be based on pediatri c PK and safet y data from  Study LVIG and 
the PK and safet y data from  the adult PAH de velopment plan.  The sel ected dose for each weight 
cohort will reflect exposures comparable to the approved 40- mg dose of tadalafil in adult s, 
unless unexpected safet y concerns unique to the pediatric populat ion are revealed.  Dosing of all 
weight cohorts is also described in Section 9.

LY450190Study LVHV will start to enroll pat ients once the appropriate PK and safet y data in Study  LVIG 
have been evaluated by  a Safety Monitoring Commi ttee (SMC).  Pl anned tadal afil doses 
(TableLVHV.9.1) for all weight cohorts in Study  LVHV may be redefined prior to the start of 
the study based on SMC and Sponsor review of the PK and safet y data from Study LVIG.  The 
safety of patients in Study  LVHV will  be monitored by an external  data monitoring committee 
(DMC).
7.1.1.Screening Phase (Visit 1)
Screening a nd eligibilit y evaluations will be performed during an approximately 28 -day period 
prior to randomizing patients to study  treatment (Attachment 1).  At or before Visit 1, the study  
and potenti al risks will  be explained to patients and parents/legal representatives (hereafter, 
“parent” i s used to refer to “parent” or “legal representati ve”). Parents will sign and date the 
informed consent form  (ICF), and the patients will sign and date the assent document (if capable) 
if required by the inst itutional review board (IRB) or local law prior to any screening or Day  1 
assessments.  Qualified patients who meet inclusio n and exclusio n criteria will be enro lled into 
Period1.
The Screening visit (Visit 1) will consist of a full clinical assessment, as detailed in the Study  
Schedule ( Attachment 1 ), including a medical evaluation, assessment of PAH severit y, physical 
examination, concomitant medicat ions, laboratory  tests, and the Clinician Glo bal Impressio n of 
Severity (CGI-S, Day 1 only).  
7.1.2.Study Period 1:  Double -Blind Treatment Phase (Visits 2 to 9)
Study Period1 is a 24-week, double -blind treatment phase that will include 8 site 
Visits(Attachment 1).  During this study  period, patients will continue to receive stable ERA 
therapy.
Day 1 (Visit 2) assessments that were not collected during screening will be collected prior to 
randomization at Day 1 (Visit 2).  Patients who have co mpleted all Day 1 (Vi sit 2)assessments 
and who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomly assigned to either placebo or tadalafil 
at Day 1 (Visit 2) by an interactive vo ice or web response system (IXRS) .  Investigators will 
remain blinded to the patie nt’s treatment assignment.  The first dose of assigned treatment will 
be administered at Day 1 (Visit 2) .
The 6MW test will occur on Day  1 (Visit2), and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (Visits 4 to 9) 
for those pati ents who are ≥6years of age at Day  1 (Visit2) and are developmentally capable o f 
performing the test. 
Echocardi ography to obtain cardiopulmo nary hemodynamics will occur at Day  1 (Visit 2) and 
Weeks8, 16, and 24 (Visits 5, 7, and 9, respectively).  Cardiac MRI to obtain cardiopulmo nary 
hemodynamics will occur at Day  1 (Visit 2) and Week 24 (Visit9) at selected sites that have 
been using MRI as routine PAH patient management.  The detailed procedures for 
echocardiography and cardiac MRI will be provided separately to the Invest igator sites.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 28
LY450190A single blood sample will be co llected at Weeks 2, 4, 16, and 24 (Visits 3, 4, 7, and 9, 
respectively ), for analysis of plasma tadalafil concentrations (Section 10.4.1. and Attachment 1 ).
Safety evaluations will consist of vital signs, ECGs, physical examinat ion, laboratory  
evaluations, eye examinations, and conco mitant medications; these will be performed at times 
specified in the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1).  AEs will be assessed at all site visitsduring the 
study.
7.1.3.Study Period 2: Open-Label Extension (Visits 10-17)
During Peri od2 the long -term safety of tadalafil in pediatric patients with PAH will  be 
evaluated.
Patients who parti cipated in Peri od1 will be eligible to participate in Period 2.  Patients who 
experience CW (defined in Section 10.1.2) during Period 1 will be discont inued from Period 1 
and may also participate in Period 2, at the Investigator’s discretion.
Investigator site visits during Peri od2 will occur every 3 months in accordance with the LVHV 
study schedule ( Attachment 1).
Period2 will cont inue for at least 2years or un til the Sponsor concludes the study .
Patients receiving tadalafil in Period 1 will cont inue at the same dose in Period 2, unless the 
patient has changed his/her weight cohort at the end of Period 1 (at Visit 9 or the Early  
Termination visit).  Patients receiving placebo in Period 1 will receive tadalafil in Period 2 at the 
corresponding tadalafil dose for the patient’s weight cohort at entry  into Period2 
(TableLVHV.9.1).  During Period 2, the dose of tadalafil may b e adjusted if the patient’s weight 
changes by  at least 1 kg over or below the weight cohort thresho lds of 25 kg and 40 kg. If this 
weight change occurs, the patient’s dose of study  drug may be adjusted so that they  are receiving 
the appropriate weight coh ort-related dose.   During this study  period, patients will continue to 
receive stable ERA therapy , which coul d be adjusted at the Invest igator’s discretion.
Patients who experience CW ( Section 10.1.2) during Period 2 will be managed according to the 
best treatm ent options, and will continue to be monitored for safet y and efficacy as described in 
the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1).
7.2.Discussion of Design and Control
Study H6D-MC-LVHV (LVHV) is a Phase 3, internat ional, randomized, mult icenter, 2-period, 
double-blind and placebo -controlled (Period 1), add -on study (in addition to the patient’s current 
ERA) to evaluate tadalafil efficacy , safety, and popul ation PK in pediatric patients with PAH.  A 
multicenter trial is necessary  to accrue the required number of pediatric patients with PAH to 
adequately  characteri ze the efficacy and safet y of tadalafil in this patient popul ation in a timely 
manner.  The efficacy  and safet y of tadalafil will be compared with that of pl acebo group during 
Period 1.
This study  design requi res patients to be receiving an ERA (such as bosentan or ambrisentan), 
and allows for the use of conventional PAH therapies (see Section 8.1).  Endothelin receptor 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 29
LY450190antagonists are required, as there are sufficient data available in the adult populat ion to 
reasonably  predict safet y with ERA therapy  (Study LVGY).  A placebo-only treatment arm is 
not being proposed for this study , as assigning pediatric PAH pat ients to treatm ent with placebo 
alone may be viewed as unethical .  To ensure that treatment assignment is balanced wit hin type 
of ERA, rando mization to treatm ent will be stratified by  type of ERA (bosentan or other).
Stratificat ion by PAH etio logy is justified, as the prognosis o f patients with PAH is, in part, 
dependent on etiology .  For exam ple, patients with PAH associ ated with connective tissue 
disease have a worse prognosis than pat ients with idiopathic PAH, while patients with PAH 
associated with congenital heart disease have a better survival (Kähler and Co lleselli 2006;
McLaughlin et al. 2004 ). 
Randomization stratified by weight is considered reasonable to ensure an appropriate distribution 
of treatments withinweight cohorts.  Historically, male and female pediatric growth charts could 
be globally applied to clinical research based on common weight and age patterns; however, 
these may not be applicable to pediatric patients wit h PAH due to differences in diseas e 
conditions and due to a modest divergence in body weight and age patterns across geographies.  
Therefore, treatment randomizat ion will be stratified by  weight cohort.
This study  is designed to evaluate the efficacy of tadalafil compared with placebo in p ediatric 
patients with PAH.  The primary efficacy endpo int will be the change from Baseline (Day  1) to 
Week 24 in6MW distance assessed in those patients who are ≥6years of age at Day  1 (Visit2) 
and are developmentally capable o f performing the test.   
Due to the expected low mortalit y event rate in this populat ion, mortality rate is not considered 
an appropriate primary endpo int in PAH studies; therefore, the use of a composite endpo int to 
define CW (Section 10.1.2) will provide more statistical power to detect a therapeutic effect in a 
limited sample populat ion with limited individual event rates (Ventetuolo et al. 2008).  The 
proposed definit ion of CW endpo int (Section 10.1.1) is similar to that used in other trials and 
takes into account a recent publicat ion that offered recommendations bas ed on histori cal review 
of PAH studi es on CW as an endpoint (McLaughlin et al. 2009b).  While the frequency of events 
of CW in pat ients with mild or moderate functional class (II, III) are expected to be low after 
16weeks, evaluat ion of this endpo int at 24 weeks (6 months) will increase the likelihood of 
detecting a treatment effect ( Rubinet al. 2002).
Exercise capacit y is an important prognostic indicator of PAH (Miyamoto et al. 2000). The 
distance wal ked during a 6MW test i s the most accepted PAH exercise capacit y test,as it is 
simple, well tolerated, and non -invasive (Peacock et al. 2 010) and has therefore been the most 
commonly used clinical  trial endpoint for PAH patients ≥6years of age (Haworth and Beghetti 
2010).For Study  LVHV, it isexpected thatapproximately 34 enrolled patients will be 6 years of 
age or older who are develop mentally capable of performing the 6MW test. The change in 
6MWDcompared with placebo will  be evaluated up to Week 24.

8.2.1.Rationale for Inclusion and Exclusion of Certain Study 
Candidates
Inclusion criteria [1], [2], [3], and [4] are in place to ensure that PAH is properly characterized in 
pediatric patients.
Inclusion criteria [5] and [6] are in place to ensure that patients receiving PAH therapy (s) are 
stabilized with regards to their therapy (s) prior to entry  into this study .
Inclusion criterion [7] is in place to prohibit inclusion of female pat ients who are pregnant or 
who are at risk of beco ming pregnant.
Inclusion criterion [8] is in place to protect the safety  of each patient.
Exclusion criteria [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] , [24], and [32] are in place 
to prohibit patients who have physical exist ing condit ions that would confound the trial results 
and, in the case of exclusion criterion [24], to prevent undue risk to an infant or fetus .
Exclusion criteria [19], [20], [21], [ 22], and [23] are in place to prohibit the enrollment of 
patients who are taking medicat ions that would confound the trial results .
Exclusion criteria [25], [26], and [28] are in place to prevent a previously  enrolled patient from 
re-entering the study  that may have already had study  medication.  This would confound the 
analysis.
Exclusion criteria [27] and [29] are in place to assure that the patients can take the medicat ion in 
the forms that are available in this trial.
Exclusion criteria [30] and [31] ar e in place to prevent possible study bias fro m close relations.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 34
LY4501908.3.Discontinuations
Patients who experience CW (defined in Sect ion 10.1.2) during Perio d 1 may, at the 
Investigator’s discret ion, participate in Period 2, during which pat ients will receive open -label 
tadalafil treatment and standard of care as deemed by  the Invest igator, and will cont inue to be 
monitored for safet y and efficacy (ie, CW).   Patients who conti nue to Peri od 2 (because they  
either completed Peri od 1 or experi enced CW in Peri od 1) will have all o f the Week 24 (Visit 
9/Early Terminat ion) assessments performed (Attachment 1) before proceeding to Period 2.
For patients who discont inue Period 1 and who do not participate in Period 2, AEs occurring 
after a patient has taken the last dose of study  drug will be collected for 30 da ys after the last 
dose of study  drug or up to the end of Period I (whichever is longer), regardless of seriousness or 
the Investigator's opinio n of causat ion.  Patients who discont inue in Period 1 and who do not 
participate in Period 2, will have all o f the Week 24 (Visit 9/Early Terminat ion) assessments 
performed (Attachment 1 ).  If a patient discont inues prior to or at Visit 8, the fo llow-up visit will 
be perform ed 24 weeks after the patient’s init ial study drug dosing (Visit 9). If a patient 
discontinues after Visit 8, the fo llow-up visit will occur 30 days after the patient has taken the 
last dose of study  drug. This visit can be done by phone.  Discontinuation of the study  drug for 
abnormal liver tests i s discussed in Sect ion 10.3.4.1.
8.3.1.Discontinuation Proc edures
The nature of any condit ions, clinical signs or symptoms, or abnormal laboratory  values present 
at the time of discont inuation and any applicable follow -up procedures will be documented.
8.3.2.Discontinuation of Patients
The criteria for enrollment m ust be followed explici tly.  If a patient who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertent ly enrolled, that patient will be discont inued from the study, and 
Lilly or its designee must be contacted.
Patients will be discontinued from the investigational product and fro m the study in the 
following circumstances:
Enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an investigational product or enrollment in 
any other ty pe of medical research judged not to be scient ifically or medically co mpatible 
with this study
The subject develops a condit ion or begins a therapy  that woul d have excluded 
entry into the study , except the following:
-Exception:  A patient receiving an ERA who develops an AST or ALT >3 times ULN 
may remain in the study , but must have ERA dosage adj ustments and monitoring that 
are consistent with the adult recommendations in the respect ive ERA labels.
The Investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn.  If this decisio n is 
made because of a serious adverse event (SAE) or a clinically  significant 
laboratory  value, the study  drug is to be discontinued and appropriate measures 
are to be taken.  Lilly  or its designee is to be al erted immediately (Section 10.3).
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 35
LY450190If the patient becomes pregnant during the study, the pat ient must discontinue the 
study immediately .
The patient, the patient’s parent, or the attending physician requests that the 
patient be withdrawn from  the study .
The Investigator or Lilly  stops the study  or stops the patient’s participat ion in the 
study for medical, safet y, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable 
laws, regulations, and good clinical practice (GCP).
The Investigator determines that the pat ient is repeatedly nonco mpliant with study  
procedures and/or study  drug.
If an Invest igator, study site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, 
the patient must be discont inued from the study.  In cases where there are ethical reasons 
tohave the patient remain in the study, the Invest igator must obtain specific approval 
from the Lilly clinical research physician (CRP).
If the patient experiences priapism then the patient must be discont inued from the study.
Patients requi ring treatment with any of the prohibited medicat ions.
Patients who discont inue the study early will have the Week 24 (Early Terminat ion visit) 
procedures performed as shown in the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).
Patients who discont inue the study will have an Early Terminat ion Visit performed at the time of 
the patient’s study  discontinuati on, or at the earliest possible date (Attachment 1) .  This early 
termination visit will be used to collect as many data/samples as practical from the patient.  The 
early termination data/sample collect ions will be the same as those collected at end of Week 24 
of Period1, or the final visit of Period 2, depending on the timing of discont inuation.
For discontinued patients during Period 1 who do not participate in Period 2, AEs occurring a fter 
a patient has taken the last dose of study  drug will  be collected for an addit ional 30 days after the 
last dose of study  drug or up to the end of Period I (whichever is longer), regardless of 
seriousness or the Invest igator’s opinio n of causat ion.  The information can be co llected by 
phone.  Di scontinued patients will not be replaced. 
8.3.3.Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study site participation may be discont inuedif Lilly, the Investigator, or the ethical review board 
(ERB) of the study  sitejudges it nec essary for medical, safet y, regulatory, or other reasons 
consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and good clinical pract ice (GCP).
8.3.4.Discontinuation of the Study
The study  will be discontinued if Lilly judges it necessary for medical, safet y, regulatory, or 
other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and GCP.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 36
LY4501909.Treatment
9.1.Treatments Administered
Patients who m eet all eligibilit y criteria will be randomized to receive tadalafil or matching 
placebo once daily  for 24 weeks in Peri od1.  In Period 2, all patients will receive tadalafil in an 
open-label fashion.  Tadalafil doses for each weight cohort will be fixed (TableLVHV.9.1). 
Tadalafil tablets or tadalafil in suspensio n will be administered orally wit h water in the morning 
of each dose day .  The ready -to-use tadalafil suspensio n should be mixed well by shaking and 
then administered within 1 hour.  The study  drug suspension will be dire ctly administered into 
the mouth using a standard sy ringe. Additional dilution or combinat ion with other substrates or 
vehicles is not allowed.  Patients may be dosed whether or not they  have eaten.  Consumpt ion of 
grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoided 1 hour prior to and after dosing.
The proposed tadalafil dose for each weight cohort for this study  (TableLVHV.9.1) may be 
amended prior to the first enrollment into each weight cohort, based on the PK and safet y data 
from the respective weight cohort in Study LVIG. However, the selected dose for each weight 
cohort is intended to reflect exposures comparable to the approved 40 -mg dose of tadalafil in 
adults, unless unexpected safet y concerns unique to the pediatric population are revealed.
During Peri od 1, patients, study  site personnel , and the Sponsor will be blinded to the treatment 
assignment.  During Period 2, all pat ients will receive tadal afil in an unblinded fashio n.
The Investigator or his/her designee is responsible for explaining the correct use of the 
investigat ional agent(s) to the patient and parent, verifying that instructions are fo llowed 
properly, maintaining accurate recor ds of invest igational product dispensing and co llection, and 
returning all unused medication to Lilly  or its designee at the end of the study .
Patients and/or parents will be instructed to contact the Invest igator as soon as possible if he or 
she has a com plaint or probl em with the invest igational product so that the situation can be 
assessed.
9.2.Materials and Supplies
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country ’s regulatory requirements.
The dose formulations that will be used in this st udy consist of tadalafil tablets, 2.5, 5, 10, or 
20mg, an oral suspensio n formulation (2.0mg/mL tadalafil), or m atching placebo. Study 
medication tablets will be provided in bottles or blister.
Tadalafil oral suspension and matched placebo will be avail able as a ready -to-use oral 
suspension containing 2 mg/mL tadalafil.  Tadal afil liquid suspensio n will be provided in a bottle 
and doses will be delivered to the patient using a standard syringe. 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 37
LY4501909.3.Method of Assignment to Treatment
Eligible pat ients will be randomized at the study  level and stratified by weight cohorts of heavy , 
middle, or light (Section 7.1), PAH etio logy (idiopathic-heritable, connect ive tissue/congenital 
heart disease, or other) and ty pe of concomitant ERA (bosentan or other).
Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a co mputer-generated random sequence 
using an IXRS.  The IXRS will be used to ass ign bottles of tablets or liquid suspensio n 
containing double -blind study  drug to each patient.  An appropriate amount of invest igational 
product will be assigned to each patient to cover the study  visit interval.  Site personnel will 
confirm that they  have located the correct bottles by  entering a confirmat ion number found on 
the bottles into the IXRSprior to dispensing the investigational product to the patient.
9.4.Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose select ion strategy  for pediatrics withPAH in this study  will be based on data from the 
tadalafil clinical development program, including data from the LVIG pediatric study  and Study  
LVGY in adults wit h PAH.  The goal is to utilize tadalafil doses administered once -daily that
deliver tadalafil exposures similar to those observed in adults receiving tadalafil 40 mg once-
daily. 
The proposed tadalafil dose for each weight cohort for this study  (TableLVHV.9.1) may be 
amended prior to the first enrollment into each weight cohort, based on the PK and safet y data 
from the respective weight cohort in Study LVIG.   Additionally, if PK data fro m Study LVIG 
demonstrate a poten tial relationship between body weight and individual tadalafil exposure, a 
weight-adjusted dosing scheme (such as mg/kg) may  be adopted.

c2 mg/mL tadalafil or placebo; directly administered into the mouth using a standard syringe .
Notes:  If dosage for each weight cohort is redefined, other strength of tablets, such as 2.5 mg or 5 mg, may be used 
to achieve the desired concentration.
If a patient’s weight changes during the study, such that he/she falls into a different weight cohort category, he/she 
will continue to receive the study drug dose appropriate to his/her original weight cohort.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 38
LY4501909.5.Selection and Timing of Doses
During Peri od 1, after the collect ion of all Day 1 assessments, patients will be rando mized to 
either tadalafil or pl acebo at Visit 2 (Day  1). The first dose of assigned treatment will be 
administered at this visit.  Patients and/or parents will be instructed to administer each 
subsequent dose (tablet or suspensio n) once daily, with or without food, in the morning. During 
Period2, every patient will be admini stered tad alafil for up to 2 years.  
If a daily dose is missed, the next dose should be administered the fo llowing day at the ty pical 
dosing time and a record of the missing dose should be provided to the Investigator.
9.6.Blinding
During Peri od 1, the IXRSwill be used to assign investi gational productcontaining double -blind 
study drug (tadal afil or placebo) to each patient according to body  weight cohort assi gnment.  
Placebo and act ive drug, either tablet or liquid suspensio n, for a particular weight cohort will be 
similar in appearance and taste, and the number of tablets or the vo lume of liquid suspensio n of 
the study drug will be the same for each weight cohort.
The IXRSwill be used to assign the appropriate package of invest igational product (treatment 
and dose) for each visit.  Patients and/or parents will be instructed to administer a fixed dose 
from the assigned package daily ( TableLVHV.9.1).
Patients, study site personnel  who record study  data, and the Sponsor will be blinded to the 
treatment being administered to study  patients.  To preserve study  blinding, access to the 
randomization table and treatment assignments will be restricted to a minim um number of Lilly 
personnel prior to database lock.
Emergency  unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IXRS.  This option may be used 
ONLY if the patient’s well-being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment.  All 
calls result ing inan unblinding event are recorded and reported by  the IXRSand will result in 
the patient being discont inued from the trial.
The Investigator should make every effort to contact the Lilly CRP prior to unblinding a 
patient’s treatment assignment.  If a pati ent’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly  must be 
notified immediately by telephone.
During Peri od1, if an Invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is 
unblinded, the patient must be discont inued from this study .  
9.7.Concomitant T herapy
Chronic use of drugs that are known potent inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided.  
Additional drugs are to be avo ided during the study, unless required to treat an AE or for the 
treatment of an ongoing medical problem.
If the need for c oncomitant m edication arises, inclusi on or continuat ion of the patient may  be at 
the discretion of the Invest igator after consultat ion with a Lilly clinical pharmaco logist or CRP.  
Any addit ional medication used during the course of the study  must be docum ented.  Medi cines 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 39
LY450190and therapies that would prevent a patient from enrolling in the study  are identified in the 
exclusion section of this protocol (see Section 8.2).
Patients who receive any conco mitant medicat ion listed in the exclusion criteria fo llowing 
randomization but before study  drug administrati on should not receive study  drug.  Pati ents 
requiring treatm ent with any of the prohibited medicat ions during the study  will be discont inued 
from the study and shoul d complete the Early Terminat ion assessments ( Attachment 1). Patients 
receiving prostacy clin or its analogues during Period 2 only , however, will  be allowed to 
continue in the study .
Dosage adj ustment of ERA medicat ions and mo nitoring patients for aminotransferase 
abnormalities must be followed according to adult re commendat ions in the respective ERA 
labels.
Post-study therapy wit h another PDE5 inhibitor should be delayed at least 96 hours after the last 
dose of the study  drug is administered.
Patientsand/or parents will be instructed to consult with the Invest igator or Study  Coordinator at 
the study site before taking newly -prescribed medications.  All non -study medications will be 
recorded on source documents at all visit s.  Non-study medications screen failures will not be 
reported to Lilly  unless the m edication is linked to an SAE or AE that the Invest igator believes 
may have been caused by  a protocol  procedure.
9.8.Treatment Compliance
Every attempt will be m ade to sel ect patients and/or parents who have the abilit y to understand 
and comply with instructions.  To ass ure appropriate drug accountabilit y, adherence will be 
emphasized at the start- up meeting, accountabilit y forms will be provided in the clinical trial 
records’ binder (or similar file), and pat ient adherence will be mo nitored throughout the study .
The Investigator will advise the pat ient and/or parents that the medicat ion should be taken at 
approximately  the same t ime of day.  If a daily dose is missed, the next dose should be 
administered the fo llowing day at the typical dosing time and a record of the missing dose should 
be provided to the Invest igator.
Each patient and/or parent will be instructed to return all study  drug packaging and material to 
the study site at each visit.  The study  site will keep a record of all drug dispensed and returned 
throughout the study.  These data will be recorded on the respect ive patient’s electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  Patient compliance with study drug will be assessed at each visit starting at 
Day 1 (Visit2).  Compliance will  be assessed by  direct questi oning, counting returned tablets, or 
suspension vo lume reconciliat ion.  Compliance with the prescribed regimen will be documented.
The Investigator (or designee) at each invest igational site will be responsible for keeping a drug 
accountabilit y log.  Drug recon ciliation will be performed at the end of the study .

10.1.4.Appropriateness of Efficacy Measures
10.1.4.1. 6MW Test
The 6MW test is the most accepted exercise capacity  test and i s also the m ost comm only used 
clinical trial endpoint in adult pulmo nary hypertensi on studies.  The reliable use of the 6MW test 
is limited in patients <6 y ears of age; therefore, 6MW test will be measured in patients who are 
≥6 years of age and who are, in the opinio n of the Investigator, devel opmentally capable 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 42
LY450190(mentally and physically).  A 6MW test assessment will be conducted at time points specified in 
Attachment 1.  The 6MW test will be recorded and evaluated by  following 6MW test guidelines 
(Attachment 7).  If a patient has decrease of 20% or more in 6MW distance compared wit h
Day1 along with worsening o f WHO functional class by 1 class or more, another 6MW test will 
be conducted 5 to 10 days later to confirm the change.  An unencouraged 6MW ( Attachment 7) 
will be used to ensure that patients are not pressured during the test. If the 6MW test and PKare 
conducted on the same day , the PK blood sam ple should be obtained prior to the 6 MW test.
10.1.4.2. Time to Clinical Worsening
Time to CWhas been considered a useful endpo int for assessing the effect iveness of PAH 
therapies on patient’s clinical status and degree of disease progression (Peacock et al. 2010 ). 
Clinical composite endpo intsareincreasingly gaining favor as the prefer red endpo int for PAH 
therapy evaluation and can be used across the entire age rang ein the pediatric population. 
Because it isclinically relevant, time to CW has been used in many PAH trials as eit her a 
primary or secondary  efficacy endpoint formeasuring treatment effect (Haworth and Beghetti 
2010). In this study, time to CW will be eval uated based on CW events that are defined in 
Section 10.1.2.
10.1.4.3. Echocardiography and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
The value o f echocardiography in diagnosing pulmonary  hypertensio n has been examined in 
various settings, including idiopathic pulmo nary hypertensio n, pulmonary hypertensi on in 
systemic sclerosi s, and pulmo nary hypertensi on associated with diffuse parenchymal lung 
disease.  Echocardiography provides both estimates of pulmo nary artery pressure and an 
assessment of cardiac structure and funct ion.  These features just ify its application as the most 
commonly used screening tool  in patients with suspected pulmo nary hypertensio n.  In this study 
echocardiography will be used to evaluate changes fro m Day 1 to Week 24 in the parameters 
noted in Section 6.3.1.
Compared with echocardi ography, MRI has been considered as a potential important diagnostic 
tool for the com prehensive evaluat ion of pulmo nary hypertensi on; it has not been fully evaluated 
for PAH patient management.
All echocardi ograms and MRIs will be transferred to a central imaging laboratory  designated by  
Lilly.  A technical expert at the central imaging laboratory  will then conduct a full review of the 
echocardiograms and MRIs. All data fr om the central  review will be provided to Lilly for 
analytical and study  report purposes.
10.1.4.4. NT-Pro-BNP
NT-Pro-BNP is a 76 amino acid N -terminal fragment of brain natriuretic pept ide (Bhalla et al. 
2004) that might have prognostic value in pat ients with chronic pulmonary hypertensio n, and 
could serve as a potential indicator of the efficacy  of vasodilator therapy  in patients with 
pulmonary hypertensio n (Fijalkowska et al. 2006; Nagaya et al. 2000).
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 43
LY45019010.2.Health Outcome/Quality of Life Measures
The following Heal th Outcome measures are al so considered secondary  measures and will be 
collected at the times shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1).
Quality of life (QoL), as m easured by  CHQ-PF28 (Attachment 6) will be co llected for patients 
aged ≥5years old.  The CHQ -PF28 is a generi c QoL instrum ent that has been designed and 
normalized for children 5 to 18 years of age.  The CHQ measures 14 unique physical and 
psychosocial concepts ( Attachment 6 ).  The CHQ- PF28 will survey  the patient or parent to 
provide answers about the physical and psychosocial well -being of the patient.
The CGI-I Scale is a standardized assessment tool and assesses the patient’s improvement or 
worsening fro m Day 1 (Attachment 4 ).  The CGI -I is intended to allow clinicians to rate a 
patient’s improvement fro m Day 1, taking into account the patient’s clinical condit ion and the 
severity of side effects com pared to the patient’s condit ion at the beginning of the trial.
The CGI-S (Attachment 5) provides an overall rat ing of the illness severity at baseline and as 
such, will be co llected at Baseline only. 
10.3.Safety Evaluations
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly  or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The Investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.
The Investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before complet ing the study .  The 
patient should be followed until the event is reso lved or explained.  Frequency o f follow-up 
evaluation is left to the di scretion of the Invest igator.
10.3.1.Period1
Safety during Peri od 1 will be evaluated using reported AEs (which will include abnormalit ies 
detected by  ECG or physical examinat ion, as well as clinically significant laboratory  
abnormalities, body weight and height, vital signs, and eye examinat ions) and conco mitant 
medications.  Tadal afil concentrations and protocol clinical laboratory  data may be collected for 
patients reporting an SAE.
10.3.2.Period2
Safety during period 2 will be evaluated by  monitoring AEs, body  weight and height, ey e 
examinations, concomitant medicat ions, Tanner scale, and intellectual abilit y and cognit ive 
functioning assessment.  Testicular integrit y toxicity will be checked by  monitoring changes in 
inhibin B bio markers in male patients fro m 9 years to less than 18 years of age. Inhibin B levels 
in patients below the age of 9 y ears must be collected in an exploratory  manner. Tadalafil 
concentrations and protocol clinical laboratory  data may be collected for pati ents reporting a n 
SAE.  
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 44
LY45019010.3.3.Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requirements that m ay be less stringent.  
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical s tudy is to 
establish drug effect.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to invest igational product 
or drug delivery system should be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are 
collected for regulatory  reporting an d drug safet y evaluation.
Study site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing 
conditions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in 
the study.
After the ICF is signed, site pe rsonnel will record any change in the condit ion(s) and the 
occurrence and nature of any AEs.  All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to Lilly 
or designee.
In addition, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of invest igational product 
must be reported to Lilly or its designee via eCRF/electronic data entry .
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs, labs, vital sign measurements, other procedures, 
and so on that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its de signee.
Investigators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, investigat ional product, and/or drug delivery  
system via electroni c data entry .
Study site personnelmust al ert Lilly or i ts designee within 24 hours of the Invest igator 
unblinding a patient’s treatment group assignment for any reason.
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly  or its designee via electronic data entry  the circumstances 
and data leading to any  such dosage reducti on or discontinuat ion of treatm ent.
10.3.3.1. Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse event (SAE) collect ion begins after the patient has signed infor med consent and 
has received invest igational product.  If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed 
consent, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the event will NOT be co llected unless the 
Investigator feels the event may have been cau sed by a protocol procedure.
Previously  planned (pri or to signing the ICF) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the 
underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study .
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 45
LY450190Study site personnel  must alert Lilly or i ts designee of any seriousadverse event (SAE) within 
24 hours of Investigator awareness of the event via a sponsor -approved method.  Alerts issued 
via telephone are to be immediately  followed with official notification on study -specific SAE 
forms.  An SAE i s any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcomes:
death 
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion
a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the Invest igator for any other reason
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered seri ous adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medicaljudgment, they  may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Serious adverse events occurring after a patient has taken the last dose of invest igational product 
will be collected 30 day s after the l ast dose of investigat ional product, regardless of the 
Investigator’s opinio n of causat ion.  Thereafter, SAEs are not required to be reported unless the 
Investigator feels the events were related to either investigational pro duct, or drug delivery 
system, or a protocol procedure.
Potential study endpoints (that is, CWas defined in Section 10.1.2), that meet serious cri teria, 
will not be reported as an SAE unless deemed by  the Invest igator to be possibly  related to 
studydrug.  
Information on SAEs expected in the study  population independent of drug exposure and, that 
will be assessed by  the sponsor in aggregate at leas t twice a year during the course of the trial, 
may be found in the IB. 
Additional laboratory  samples and a blood sample for tadalafil concentration analysis may be 
collected as needed at time of an SAE.
10.3.3.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the Invest igator identifies as related to invest igational product or procedure.  
Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording and e xpedited reporting of SUSARs 
that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated detailed guidances.
10.3.4.Safety Measures
10.3.4.1. Hepatic Monitoring
ALT and AST elevat ions may occur with the use of ERA medicat ions.  If a study patient 
experiences elevated ALT or AST >3X upper limit  of normal (ULN) or elevated total bilirubin 
>2X ULN, the patient should have ERA dosage adjust ments and monitoring that are consistent 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 46
LY450190with the adult recommendati ons in the respect ive ERA l abels.  Details for hepat ic monitoring 
depend upon the severit y and persistence o f observed laboratory  test abnorm alities.  
To ensure patient safet y and to com ply with regulatory  guidance, the Invest igator is to consult 
with the Lilly designated medical m onitor regarding the collect ion of addit ional, specific 
recommended clinical information and fo llow-up laboratory  tests, if a study  patient experi ences 
elevated ALT or AST >3X ULN or elevated total bilirubin >2X ULN.
Guidelines for the evaluat ion and man agement of pati ent with abnormal liver tests will be 
provided in the Invest igator training document.
Discontinuati on of the study  drug for abnorm al liver tests should be considered by the 
Investigator after consultation with the Lilly designated medical mo nitor when a pati ent meets 
one of the fo llowing condi tions: 
ALT or AST >8 X ULN
ALT or AST >5 X ULN for more than 2 weeks 
ALT or AST >3 X ULN and total bilirubin level >2 X ULN or prothrombin t ime >1.5 X 
ULN
ALT or AST >3 X ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vo miting, right upper-
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)
10.3.4.2. Vital Signs
Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) will be measured as specified in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachment 1) and as clinically indicated.  Blood pressure will be measured after the patient has 
been in a supine posit ion for at least 2 minutes, using the same arm for each measurement 
(Attachment 3).  The interpretation of diastolic and systolic measurements are left to the 
discretion of the Investi gator.
10.3.4.3. Eye Examination
An eye examinat ion will be performed according to the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1).  The 
examination includes pat ient medical eye history , external eye examination and retinal 
examination using an ophthalmoscope.  There are no clinical data on treatment-related effect on 
eyeswith tadalafil in pediatric populat ion. Studies during the nonclinical development of 
tadalafil and the clinical  adult populati on did not ind icate treatm ent-related effect on retina.  
Since this is the first study  to investigate tadalafil in the pediatric population, general eye safet y 
monitoring was deliberately  included as one of safety  parameters to ensure there is no effect on 
retinas in th e pediatric PAH population.  
10.3.4.4. Inhibin Monitoring
Inhibin B will be co llected by a single blood draw at the times indicated in the Study Schedule 
(Attachment 1) from all male patients.   Inhibin B is being monitored to check for potential 
testicular integrit y toxicity.In patients below the age of 9 years, this will be an exploratory  
assessment and results are blinded.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 47
LY45019010.3.4.5. Collection of Electrocardiograms
For each subject, a single 12 -lead digital ECG will be collected locally according to the Study 
Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before 
ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG collect ion.
ECGs may be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed cli nically necessary .  Collecti on of 
more ECGs (m ore replicates) than expected at a particular time point is allowed when needed to 
ensure high qualit y records.
ECGs will be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the Invest igator or qualified designee) at the 
site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the patient is still 
present, to determine whether the patient meets entry  criteria at the relevant visit(s) and for 
immediate patient management, should any clinically relevant f indings be ident ified. The 
Investigator (or qualified designee) must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time 
of collection.
After enro llment, any clinically significant changes from baseline in the pat ient’s ECG will be 
recorded as an AE in the patient’s eCRF.
10.3.4.6. Intellectual Ability and Cognitive Functioning Assessment
The patient's intellectual abilit y (intelligence quotient, IQ) will be assessed at Day  1 (Visit2, 
prior to first dose of study  drug), and after 1 y ear and 2 years following treatment initiation.  The 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children –Fourth Edit ion (WISC-IV) is the preferred instrument 
for IQ assessment.  Due to age restrictions of the WISC -IV, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scale -Fourth Edit ion (WAIS-IV) and Wechsle r Preschool and Primary  Scale of Intelligence 
(WPPSI-III) Test may also be used as detailed below.  Patients may be assessed with a different 
scale at subsequent visits depending on their age.
Patients who are aged 2 years 6months through 5 years 11months at Day 1 (Visit2) will 
be administered the WPPSI -III at Day  1 (Visit2) and follow-up visits.  For patients who 
completed the WPPSI -III at Visit 2, they will be administered the WISC -IV at any 
subsequent visit if their age exceeds or if they are older than 7years 3months.
Patients who are aged 6 years 0months through 15 years 11months at Day  1 (Visit2) 
will be administered the WISC- IV at Day  1 (Visit2) and follow-up visits.  For pati ents 
whose age exceeds 16 years 11months at subsequent visits, th e WAIS-IV will be 
administered.
Patients who are ages 16 years 0months or older at Day  1 (Visit2) will be administered 
the WAIS-IV at Day  1 (Visit2) and all subsequent visits.
If the recommended versio ns of the IQ scales listed above are not available i n the patients’ 
primary language, the site may  use the m ost recent versio n of the available scale in that 
geography .  Investigator or site study personnel should ensure the instrument 
administrator/examiner and interpreter, either at the Invest igator site or from an external 
evaluation service, meet the qualificat ion, training, and interpretation requirements per the 
instrument manual.  The IQ scal es will be administered at the times according to the Study  
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 48
LY450190Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  Comprehensive reporting of the patient's IQ is not required in this 
study.
Patients will not be excl uded from the study  if none of the recommended instruments are 
available in the patient’s primary  language or if no qualified examiner is available to conduct the 
evaluation.  Not obtaining an intellectual abilit y assessment for thi s study will not be a protocol 
violation, but notificat ion of this must be provided to the Lilly research physician prior to the 
patient's enrollment.
10.3.4.6.1. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children -Fourth Edition (WISC -IV)
The fourth edit ion of the WISC assessment (WISC -IV) is administered to children ranging fro m 
6years to 16 years, 11 months.  It cont ains 10 core subtests and 5 additional tests, and takes 60 
to 90 minutes to complete.  In this study , the 10 core subtests needed to derive a Full Scale IQ 
score are required to be completed:  Block Design, Similarit ies, Digit Span, Picture Concepts, 
Coding, Vocabulary , Letter-Number Sequencing, Matrix Reasoning, Comprehensio n, and 
Symbol Search.  The scaled score for each subtest and Full Scale IQ composite score are 
required to be entered into the eCRF.
10.3.4.6.2. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -Fourth Edition (W AIS-IV)
The WAIS –IV structure was m odified to align wit h the WISC –IV and to reflect current theory  
regarding cognit ive ability.  The WAIS -IV is used as an intelligence measure for persons aged 16 
to 90years and 11 months.  The ant icipated time for complet ion of WAIS-IV is approximately  
60 to 90 minutes.  In this study , the 10 core subtests needed to derive a Full Scale IQ score are 
required to be com pleted:  Vocabulary , Similarities, Inform ation, Symbo l Search, Coding, Vi sual 
Puzzles, Block Design, Digit Span, Ari thmetic, and Matrix Reasoning.  The scaled scores for 
each subtest and Full Scale IQ composite score are required to be entered into the eCRF.
10.3.4.6.3. Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Test -3rd Edition 
(WPPSI-III)
The WPPSI -III is an intellige nce test designed for children aged 2 years 6months to 7years 
3months.  The anticipated time for completion of WPPSI -III is approximately 25 to 60 minutes.  
In this study, the core subtests needed to compute a Full Scale IQ score are required to be 
completed.  For ages 2 years 6months to 3years 11months, these 4 core subtests are:  Receptive 
Vocabulary , Information, Block Design, and Object Assembly .  For children ages 4 years 
0months to 7years 3months, these 7 core subtests are:  Informat ion, Vocabulary, Word 
Reasoning, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning, Picture Concepts, and Coding.  The scaled score 
for each subtest and Full Scale IQ score are required to be entered into the eCRF.
10.3.5.Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRPwill monitor safety data throughout t he course of the study .  In addition, the DMC 
will review safet y data periodically, as outlined in the DMC charter.
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures and will review 
trends, laboratory  analytes, and AEs at peri odic intervals.  The Lilly CRPwill, as is appropri ate, 
consult with the functionally independent Global Patient Safet y therapeutic area physician or 
clinical scient ist, and review trends and laboratory analytes periodically.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 49
LY450190The Lilly CRPwill monitor blinded sa fety data throughout the course of the study .  A DMC 
independent of Lilly will mo nitor unblinded safet y data throughout the course of the study by 
periodic reviews of safet y data, as outlined in the DMC charter.
The Lilly CRPwill consult with the funct ionally independent Gl obal Patient Safety therapeutic 
area physician or clinical scientist as appropriate.  In the event that Lilly safet y monitoring 
uncovers an issue that needs to be evaluated further by  unblinding at the group level, the safet y 
concern wil l be communicated to the DMC.  The DMC will review the unblinded data and 
conduct appropriate analyses of the safet y data, as deemed necessary .
10.3.6.Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study participants, m onitor quality, and to 
facilitate process and product improvements.
Complaints related to unblinded concomitant drugs/drug delivery  systems are reported direct ly to 
the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert.
For blinded studies, all product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and 
released by Lilly  or delegate will be reported.
Lilly collects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery  systems used in 
medical research studies in order to ensure the safety  of study participants, m onitor quality, and 
to facilitate process and product improvements.  Investigators are instructed to report product 
complaints as they would for products i n the marketplace.
The Investigator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion ofthe product complaint reported and any associated 
AEs using the study -specific co mplaint form s provided for this purpose
faxing the completed product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lilly or its designee
If the Investigator is asked to return the produc t for investigation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.
10.4.Sample Collection and Testing
Attachment 1lists the schedule for sample collect ions in this study.
Attachment 2lists the specific tests that will be performed for this study.
Attachment 9provides a summary o f the maximum number and vol ume of invasive samples, for 
all sampling, during the study .  Fewer invasive sampling may actually  occur, but thi s will not 
require a protocol amendment.
Section 12.2.8summarizes the Plasma tadalafil concentration -time data analyses.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 50
LY45019010.4.1.Samples for Standard Laboratory Testing
Blood and Urine samples will be collected at the times specified in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachment 1).  Standard laboratory  tests including chemistry , hematology, coagulation, and 
urinalysis panels will be performed.  A urine pregnancy test will be performed (if applicable).  
Clinical labora tory tests will  be analyzed by a central  laboratory; however, pregnancy testing 
may be repeated locally during the study , if indicated by  the Invest igator.  Attachment 2 lists the 
specific tests that will be performed for this study .
Laboratory  analyte results that coul d unblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative sites 
or other blinded personnel until the study  has been unblinded.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory  safety report.
Samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to 
comply with applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory  certificat ion standards.
10.4.2.Exploratory Work
Genetic testing is a mandatory  part of thi s study.  Genetic material derived from  samples may  be 
tested for drug metabo lism enzyme po lymorphisms, transpor ter polymorphisms, associat ion of 
genetic variants with PAH, and variance in response to tadalafil.  Pharmacogenet ic data will not 
be provided back to the Invest igator nor will it be shared with pat ients in the trial.
10.4.2.1. Samples for Genetic Testing
There is growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable response to therapy  may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribution, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, t he disease 
etiology and/or the m olecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where local 
regulations allow, a 0.5 mL blood sample will be collected on a DNA filter paper (FTA card) for 
pharmacogenet ic analysis.  It is a one -time collection, a s noted in the Study Schedule 
(Attachment 1).
Samples will be stored and analysis may  be performed on genet ic variants though t to play a role 
in endothelial cell dysfunct ion, blood pressure and intracellular levels o f cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) (including but not limited to GNB3, ACE, ENOS, PDE5) to evaluate 
their association with observed clinical outcomes to LY450190.
In the event of an unexpected AE or the observat ion of unusual response, the samples may be 
genotyped and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genet ic association wit h response to 
LY450190.  These investigat ions may be limited to a focused candidate gene study  or, if 
appropriate, genome wide associat ion studies may be perform ed to identify regions of the 
genome associated with the variabilit y observed in drug response.  Samples will be used only for 
investigat ions related to disease and drug or class of drugs under study  in the context of this 
clinical program.  They will not be used for broad exploratory  unspecified disease or populat ion 
genetic analysis.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 51
LY450190Samples will be identified by the pat ient number (coded) and stored for up to 15 years after the 
last subject visit for the study at a facility selected by  the Sponsor.  The sam ple and any  data 
generated fro m it can only be linked back to the patient by  Investigator site personnel.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 52
LY45019011.Data Quality  Assurance
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will do the fo llowing:
Provide instructi onal material to the study  sites, as appropriate.
Sponsor a start -up training sessio n to instruct the Investigators and Study  
Coordinators.  This sessio n will give instructi on on the protocol, the completion 
of the eCRFs, and study  procedures.
Make periodic visits to the study  site.
Be available for consultation and stay  in contact wit h the study  site personnel  by 
mail, telephone, and/or fax.
Review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard com puter edits to detect errors 
in data collect ion.
Verify the qualit y of the data.
In addition, Lilly or its representatives may periodically check a sample of the patient data 
recorded against source documents at the study  site.  The study  may be audited by Lilly Medical 
Quality Assurance (MQA) personnel, its designated representatives, or regulatory  agencies at 
any time.  Auditors will make every  effort to provide Invest igators ample notificat ion of 
upcoming audits.
A central laboratory  will be used to ma intain consistency  of methods and to com pile laboratory  
data across study  sites and/or across studies.
The following measures will be taken for drug accountabilit y:
Drug accountabilit y will be emphasized at start -up meetings.
A drug accountabilit y form will be provided in the clinical study  records binder or similar 
file.
Drug accountabilit y will be checked during m onitoring visits.
To ensure the safet y of participants in the study , and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the Invest igator will keep records of laboratory  tests, clinical notes, and patient medical 
records in the patient files as original source documents for the study .  If requested, the 
Investigator will provide the sponsor, applicable regulatory  agencies, and applicable ERBs with 
direct access to original source documents.
11.1.Data Capture S ystem
An electronic data capture sy stem will be used in this study .  The site maintains a separate source 
for the data entered by  the site into the sponsor -provided electronic data capture syst em.  Some 
or all of a patient’s data (for example, rating scales, daily dosing schedules, subject diaries, or 
event diaries) may be entered into the electronic data capture (EDC) system direct ly via an eCRF 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 53
LY450190at the time that the informat ion is obtained.  In instances where no prior written or electronic

LY45019012.Sample Size and Statistical Methods
12.1.Determination of Sample Size
The primary efficacy measure is 6MWDand will be evaluated in this study  during Peri od 1. 
At least34patients will be stratified by weight and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tadalafil or 
placebo treatm ent in this study  (17to placebo treatment and 17 to tadalafil treatment).  
With 2 patients not having postbaseline 6MWD , a sample size of 32 randomized patients is 
assumed to be ≥6 to <18 years of age who are devel opmentally able to com plete the 6MW D
test.  This sample size willprovide 71% power to detect a placebo -adjusted mean difference in 
change in 6MWD of 40 meters with a standard deviat ion of 60 m etersand a two -sided 
significance l evel of 0.2. 
12.2.Statistical and Analytical Plans
The Statistical Analysis Plan will include additionaldetails regarding the statist ical analyses of 
datafrom this study.
12.2.1.General Considerations
Efficacy analyses of Period 1 data, except 6MW measurements, will include all patients who 
were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study  medication.  The analysis o f 6MW data will 
include only  the subset of randomized pat ients ≥6 to <18 years of age who took at least 1 dose of 
study medication and were able to perform a 6MW test.  Patients will be analyzed according to 
the randomized treatment assignment .  Patients with no post Day 1data for a particular efficacy 
endpoint will be excluded fro m the analysis o f that endpoint.  Additional sensitivity analyses 
utilizing imputed values for missing post Day 1 data may be conducted for specific endpoints.  
Safety analyses will include all rando mized pat ients who took at least 1 dose of study  
medication.
All efficacy measures will be summarized by descript ive statist ics for each treatm ent group.  For 
continuous variables, summary  statistics will include the numbe r of observations, mean, median, 
minimum and maximum values, and standard deviation or standard error.  For categorical 
variables, counts and percentages will be tabulated for each category .  The 25thpercentile, 
median and 75thpercentile will be presente d for variables that are analyzed using rank -
transformed data.
Given the small sample size , noformal comparison will be made between treatment groups . 
Hence, the overall treatment difference p -value and the visit -wise p-values will not be reported.
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a princi pal feature of the protocol.  Any other change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for the change, will be described in the 
clinical study  report.  Addi tional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed 
appropriate.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 55
LY45019012.2.2.Patient Disposition
The number and percentage of patients screened and rando mly assigned to treatment will be 
presented by investigative site and weight cohort.  Reasons for screen failure will be 
summarized.  The final disposit ion of rando mized patients and reasons for early discont inuation 
will be summarized for Period 1 and Period 2.
12.2.3.Patient Characteristics
Patient charact eristics will be summarized for each treatment group.  Patient characteristics at 
Day 1will include age, sex, race, ethnicit y, weight cohort, weight (kg), height (cm), and Tanner 
score.
Day 1disease characteristics that will be summarized include PAH et iology, duration of PAH, 
prior PAH therapies received, ty pe of concomitant ERA therapy , WHO functional class, and 
6MW.  Addit ionally, patient disease severit y at Day 1as assessed by CGI- S will be summarized.
Day 1 data are defined as the most recent data c ollected pri or to randomizat ion.
12.2.4.Concomitant Therapy
Previous and concomitant therapies will be coded using the World Healt h Organization Drug 
Dictionary (WHO Drug).  Previ ous therapi es are those therapi es that started and stopped prior to 
the first dose o f study medication.  Concomitant therapies are those therapies that started on or 
after the first dose of study  medication or those therapi es that started prior to the first dose of 
study medication and were ongoing when the first dose of study  medication was given.  Previous 
and conco mitant therapi es will be summarized by  drug class and therapy  name by treatment 
group for all rando mized pat ients.  Summaries will consist of the number and percent of patients 
taking a drug from each drug class and therapy  name.
12.2.5.Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will be assessed in Period 1 by reconciling the number of doses of study  
treatment dispensed at Visits 2 through 8 wi th the number of doses returned at Visits 3 through 9, 
and in Period 2 by reconciling the num ber of doses dispensed at Visits 9 through 16 wi th the 
number of doses returned Visit s10 through 17.  Treatment compliance at each visit will be 
calculated as the number of doses of treatment taken during a visit interval divided by  the 
number of days in the visit interval.  Overall treatment compliance for a study period will be 
defined as the number of doses of treatment taken during the study  period divided by the number 
of days that the patient was actively participating in the study  period.
12.2.6.Primary Ou tcome and Methodology
The primary  efficacy endpoint ofchange from baseline (Day 1) in 6MW distance will be 
analyzed at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 with a mixed effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM).  This analysis will include only pat ients who are ≥6to <18 years of age and are 
developmentally able to complete 6MW testing during Period 1.  Factors in the MMRM model 
include visit, baseline 6MWD, PAH etio logy, type of endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) 
therapy,and treatment group.  Within the mod el, the effect of PAH et iology will only be 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 56
LY450190included if there are at least 3 patients per treatment arm at each PAH aet iology level.  Similarly, 
the effect of ERA therapy  will only  be included if there are at l east 3 pati ents per treatm ent arm 
at each ERA therapy level.   
As the study  has a limited number of pat ients enrolled, an inspect ion of the model estimated
mean change in 6MWD and corresponding CIs will be used instead of significance testing to 
ensure whether they  are trending in the right directio n.  The overall treatment difference p -value 
and the visit -wise p-values will not be reported.
These object iveswill be assessedand results reported at the end of Period 1.
12.2.7.Efficacy Analyses
Secondary  and additional efficacy  endpoints will  include all  patients who were randomized to 
treatment and took at least 1 dose of study  medication.
The proporti on of patientswho experience a change in WHO funct ional class will be 
summarized.   Changes will also be categorized as “worsening, “no change ,” or “improving” over 
the study period.  
The incidence of CW (Section 10.1.2) will be summarized as the number and percentage of 
patients in each treatment group who experience at least one criterion of the CW definit ion 
during the study  period.  
Changes fro m Day 1to endpoint in hemod ynamic param eters collected via echocardi ography
and MRI will be analyzed wit h analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models.  Models will include 
terms for Day 1value, weight cohort, PAH etio logy, type of ERA therapy, and treatment group.
These obj ectives will be analyzed and results reported at the end of Period 1.  No adjust ments for 
multiple comparisons will be made for the analysis of these endpo ints.
During Peri od2, the incidence and time to first occurrence of CW during Period 2 will be 
assessed.  The percentage of patients who participate in Period 2 and who experience one of the 
CW criteria will be summarized.  In addit ion, change fro m Day 1of Period1 in 6MW and WHO 
functional class will be reported for all pat ients who participate in Peri od2.
Changes fro m Day 1in NT-Pro-BNP values will be analyzed wit h an analysis o f variance 
(ANOVA) model.  NT- Pro-BNP values will be log -transformed for analysis.  Day 1values for 
NT-Pro-BNP concentrations will be the last value collected prior to random ized treatment 
assignment at Day  1 (Visit2).
12.2.8.Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Plasma tadal afil concentrati on-time data will be pooled and evaluated using a populat ion PK 
approach.  The model structure to be used for this evaluat ion is expected to be the same mode l 
structure determined to be suitable for tadalafil PK data in pediatric patients in Study  LVIG.  The 
effects of body  weight, age, and sex on apparent clearance will be explored.  If the number of 
patients taking different ty pes of ERA is sufficient to qua ntify the effect of ERA on apparent 
clearance, then thi s will also be done.  Due to random PK sampling times and the low number of 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 57
LY450190samples available fro m each individual patient, it may be necessary  to combine the data from  this 
study with the densely samp led data from Study  LVIG to better characterize the population PK 
of tadalafil in this patient popul ation.
12.2.9.Health Outcome/Quality of Life Analyses
An ANCOVA analysis will be used to examine changes fro m Day 1to Weeks 16 and 24 in 
CHQ-PF28 scores.  The models will include terms for Day 1score, Day 1value, weight cohort, 
PAH etio logy, type of ERA therapy , and treatm ent group.
Patient outcom e will be assessed using the CGI -I at Weeks 16 and 24 (Visits 7 and 9)using an 
ordinal scale with 7 response categories ranging from “Very Much Better” to “Very Much 
Worse.”  Responses will also be grouped into 3 derived categories (“Worse, ” “No Change ,” and 
“Better”) for additional analysis.  The proportion of pat ients in each of the 7 response categories 
and each of the 3 derived categories will be summarized by  treatment group.  
12.2.10. Safety Analyses
Safety during Peri od1 will be assessed through AEs including abnormalit ies detected by  ECG or 
physical examinat ion, clinical chemistry  and hematol ogy panels, urinalysis, vital signs, ey e 
examinations, and concomitant medicat ions.  During Period 2, safety will be m onitored using 
AEs, changes in body  weight and height, inhibin B bio marker (male pat ients only), eye 
examinations, Tanner scale, and intelligence tests.  The analysis o f safety will include all pat ients 
who took at l east 1 dose of study  medication.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
preferred term.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as events that first occurred or 
worsened after the first dose of study  medication on Day 1 (Visit 2).  Treatm ent-related adverse 
events are defined as events that are determined to be possibly or probably treatment -related by  
the Investigator.  The percentages of pat ients experiencing AEs across various criteria (for 
example, treatment -emergent, treatm ent-related, serious, etc.) will be displayed by  treatment 
groups.
Changes fro m Day 1in clinical laboratory  measurements, inhib in B biomarker concentrations, 
blood pressure, and HR will be analyzed wit h ranked ANOVA models with a term for treatment 
group.  Observed laboratory  values and changes from Day 1in laboratory  values will be 
evaluated for categorical changes based on norm al rangesand displayed by  treatment groups .   
Changes fro m Day 1in composite intelligence scores will be assessed according to the published 
instructions for each instrument.  The numbers and percentages of patients in each treatment 
group with shift s inTanner stage at Year 1 and Year 2 will be summarized.  Day 1values for 
laboratory  data, vital signs, body  weight and height, inhibin B bio marker, Tanner scale, and 
intelligence tests will be the last values collected prior to randomized treatment assignm ent at 
Day 1 (Visit2).
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 58
LY45019012.2.11. Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup an alyses will be conducted as deemed appropriate and necessary .  Detailed 
descriptionsof the subgroup variables will be provided in the statistical analysis plan .
12.2.12. Interim Analyses
The database will be loc ked and data collected during Period 1 will be analyzed when all 
randomized patients have ended participat ion in Period1.  This will not be considered an interim 
lock per se, as i t will be the final l ock for Period 1. These results will be reported in a c linical 
study report.  An addi tional clinical study  report will be prepared at the conclusio n of Period 2 to 
present analyses of the OLE data.
Summaries of pat ient safety data, including reported and adjudicated clinical endpoint events, 
will be mo nitored by a DMC throughout the study.  In addition, an interim analysis o f the 6MW
data is planned.  The interim analysis is planned to occur in approximately Q1 2017.  Heavy-and 
mid-weight cohorts, likely  to be com prised of patients ≥6 to <18 years of age who are 
developmentally able to com plete the 6MW test, will be the first cohorts to enroll in Study  
LVHV.  As a result, it is expected that approximately 50% of all rando mized pat ients will have 
6MW test scores at baseline and Week 24 at th e time of the planned interim analysis.  This 
would provide 65% power to detect a 35 m difference in change in 6MW distance with a 
standard deviat ion of 60 m and a 0.05 significance level . The results of this interim analysis will 
be reviewed by the DMC f or Study LVHV for evidence of efficacy and to confirm the accuracy  
of study design assumpt ions.  Other efficacy endpoints may  be examined at the time of the 
interim analysis ,as appropri ate.
Only the DMC is authorized to evaluate unblinded interim efficacy and safety analyses.  Study  
sites will receive information about interim results only  if they need to know for the safet y of 
their patients.

a.Patients who continue to Period 2 (because they completed or discontinued Period 1), will have all of the Week 24 (Visit 9/ET Visit) assessments performed 
before proceeding to Period 2.  Patients, who discontinue P eriod 1 and do not participate in Period 2, will also have all of the Week 24 (Visit 9/ET Visit) 
assessments performed.
b.This follow -up visit will be conducted only for patients who discontinue from the study during Period 1 and wi ll not participate in P eriod 2.  If a patient 
discontinues prior to or at Visit 8, the follow -up visit will be performed 24 weeks after the patient’s initial study drug dosing (Visit 9). If a patient 
discontinues after Visit 8, the follow -up visit will occur 30 days after the patient has taken the last dose of study drug. This visit can be done by phone.
c.Including family history of menarche.
d.Eye examination includes patient medical eye history, external eye examination and retinal examination using ophthalmoscopy.
e.6MW test will be performed for those patients ≥6years of age and who are, in the opinion of the Investigator developmentally capable (mentally and 
physically) of performing a 6MW test.  Patient with worsening of WHO functional class by 1 class or more and a decrease of ≥20% in the 6MW d istance, 
another 6MW will be repeated 5 to 10 days later to confirm the change. An unencouraged 6 -MW will be used to ensure that p atients are not pressured during 
the test.  A separate “practice” 6MW test must be done before or during Visit 2 (Day 1).
f.To be performed locally.  Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collection and remain supine b ut awake during ECG

Blood Pressure Collection Protocol
According to the American Heart Associat ion (AHA) blood pressure is most conveniently 
measured in children by  the auscul tation method using a standard sphygmo manometer.  
Therefore, the invest igation sites will be encouraged to use this method rather than a utomated 
devices.  An exception is allowed in the case o f young infants in whom auscultation is difficult 
and in intensive care settings where frequent measurements are needed.  
Correct blood pressure measurement in children requires a cuff which is appro priate for the size 
of the child’s upper arm.  This will require a cuff bladder that covers 80% of the 100% of the 
circumference of the arm.  Thus the recommended size for infants is 6×12 cm and the 
recommended size for older children is 9×18 cm.  A standa rd adult cuff, a large adult cuff and a 
thigh cuff for l eg blood pressure m easurement and for use in children with very  large arms 
should also be available.
Blood pressure will be measured after the patient has been in a supine posit ion for at least 2 
minutes, using the same arm for each measurement. The interpretation of diastolic and systolic 
measurements is left to the discret ion of the Invest igator.

of Improvement (CGI -I)
The Clinical Glo bal Impression of Improvement (CGI -I) Scale (Guy 1976) is a standardized 
assessment tool and assesses the patient’s improvement or worsening fro m Day 1.  The CGI -I is 
intended to allow clinicians to rate a patient’s improvement fro m Day 1, taking into account the 
patient’s clinic al condition and the severi ty of side effects com pared to the patient’s condit ion at 
the beginning of the trial.  The Global Improvement subscale ranges from 1 (very much 
improved) to 7 (very  much worse).
The following is the CGI- I question the will be use d in this trial:
How woul d you rate the overall improvement in this pat ient's symptoms o f pulmonary arterial 
hypertensio n compared to patient’s condit ion at the beginning of the trial?
1 = Very much improved
2 = Much improved
3 = Minimally improved

LY450190Attachment 7. Protocol LVHV Guidelines for Conduct of 
Unencouraged 6 -Minute Walk Test
(modified fro m Am J Respir Crit Care Med . 2002; 166:111 -7)
The test should be conducted along a long, flat, enclosed corridor with a hard surface that is 
seldom traveled.  If weather permits, the test may be conducted outdoors.  The corridor must be 
as quiet as possible while the test is underway to minimize exte rnal interference.  The distance 
that the patient has to walk before changing directions must be 30 meters in length, so as not to 
artificially reduce the distance walked during the test.  The length of the corridor should be 
marked every  3 meters and turn around points should be marked with a bright ly colored cone.  A 
starting line, which marks the beginning and end of each 60 -meter lap, should be marked on the 
floor with brightly co lored tape.
1.Before starti ng the test, record all pertinent information s urrounding the test, i.e., starting 
location, length of hallway , direction the subject will be walking, time of test, patient’s 
general condit ion/feeling on the day  of the test, and any  other physical or m edical 
information that may potentially influence t he results of the test.
2.Instruct the patient as fo llows:
“The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes.  You will walk back 
and forth in this hallway .  Six minutes is a l ong time to walk, so y ou will be exerting 
yourself.  You wil l probably get out of breath or become exhausted.  You are permitted to 
slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary .  You may lean against the wall while 
resting, but resume walking as soon as y ou are able.  You will be walking back and forth 
around the cones.  You should pivot briskly  around the cones and continue back the other 
way without hesitation.  Now I’m  going to show you.  Please watch the way  I turn 
without hesitation.”
(Demonstrate by  walking one l ap yourself.  Wal k and pivot around a cone brisk ly.)
“Are you ready to do that?  I am  going to use this counter to keep track of the number of 
laps you complete.  I will click it each time y ou turn around at this starting line.  
Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE for 6 minutes, but d on’t run 
or jog.
Start now, or whenever y ou are ready .”
3.Have the pat ient stand at the starting po int.  Simultaneously, give the patient a signal to 
start walking as qui ckly as possible, record the start time, and cont inue timing for the 6 -
minute period.
4.Do not talk to any one during the walk.  Use an even tone of vo ice when using the 
standard phrases of encouragement.  Watch the patient.  Do not get distracted and lose 
count of the laps.  Each time the participant returns to the starting line, click th e lap 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 72
LY450190counter once (or mark the lap on the worksheet).  Let the participant see y ou do it.  
Exaggerate the click using body  language, like using a stopwatch at a race.
After the first minute, tell the patient the fo llowing (in even tones):  “You are doing well.  
You have 5 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing:  “Keep up the 
good work.  You have 4 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing:  “You are 
doing well.   You are halfway done.”
When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing:  “Keep up the 
good work.  You have only 2 minutes left.”
When the timer shows 1 minute remaining, tell the patient:  “You are doing well.  You 
have only  1 minute to go.”
Do not use other words of encouragement (or body language to speed up).
If the patient stops walking during the test and needs a rest, say this:  “You can lean 
against the wall if you would like:  then cont inue walking whenever you feel able.”   Do 
not stop the timer.  If the patient stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to continue 
(or you decide that they  should not conti nue), wheel  the chair over for the pati ent to sit 
on, discontinue the walk, and note on the worksheet the distance, the time stopped, and 
the reason for stopping prematurely .
When the timer is 15 seconds fro m completion, say this:  “In a m oment I’m going to tell 
you to stop.  When I do, just stop right where y ou are and I will co me to you.”
When the timing of the 6 -minute Period1 is complete, the patient should be instructed to 
stop walking and the time recorded.  The patient must not move the final lo cation until 
the person conducting the test marks that location.  Once the patient’s final locat ion has 
been marked, all ow the pati ent to leave the test course.
Measure the distance fro m the starting point to the final locat ion and calculate the 
distance wal ked as foll ows:
Distance walked = (number of “laps” completed) x (length of 1 “lap” in meters) + 
(distance of any partial lap).
Record the distance walked by  the patient.
If a subject uses oxy gen during the Day  1 6-minute walk test, subsequent 6 -minute walk tests 
must be conducted with the subject using oxy gen.  Similarly, subjects performing the 6 -minute 
walk test on roo m air at Day 1 should have subsequent 6 -minute walk tests performed while on 
room air.

Study Rationale
Currently no therapies are there are a limited number of therapies approved in the United States 
(US) for the treatment of children wit h pulmonary arterial hypertensio n (PAH); bosentan (Uni ted 
States [US] and European Unio n [EU]) and sildenafil (EU) .  There is a growing body  of 
evidence, however, supporting the use of therapies approved in the adult populat ion with PAH,
that has led to widespread off -label use in this pediatric populat ion.  There continues to be, 
however, a need for robust data to inform prescribing physicians regarding the safet y and 
efficacy of all treatment options, including tadal afil, in the pediatr ic PAH populat ion.
This is the first Phase 3 study  of tadalafil for use in treating PAH in pediatric pat ients.

Pharmacokinetics :  Population PK assessment of plasma tadalafil concentrations at steady -state.
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 83
LY450190Statistical Methods: Results of statistical hypothesis tests will be reported using 2 -sided p-values, unless 
otherwise specified for a particular endpoint. 
Sample Size : The sample size of 34 randomized patients will provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 3.6 in 
time to first incidence of CW during the 24 week Period 1 follow -up, based on a two -sided 0.3 significance level 
and assumptions of an estimated placebo eve nt rate for CW during Period 1 of 15%, and an estimated 
discontinuation rate for causes other than CW during Period 1 of 10%.  In addition, a sample size of 134 patients is 
expected to include at least 96 patients (48 per treatment arm) who are able to com plete the 6MW test ,which will 
provide 80% power to detect a placebo -adjusted mean difference in change in 6MW distance of 35m with a 
standard deviation of 60m and a two -sided significance level of 0.05. At least 3 4patients will be stratified by 
weight an d randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tadalafil or placebo treatment in this study (1 7to placebo treatment and 
17to tadalafil treatment).  
With 2 patients no thaving postbaseline 6MWD, a samplesize of 32 randomized patients is assumed to be ≥6 to 
<18 years of age who are developmentally able to complete the 6MW test .  This sample size will provide 71% 
power to detect a placebo -adjusted mean difference in change in 6MWD of 40 meters with a standard deviation of 
60 metersand a two -sided significance level of 0.2.   
Efficacy:  Efficacy analyses of Period 1 data, except 6MW measurements, will include all patients who were 
randomized and took at least 1 dose of study medication.  The analysis of 6MW data will include only the subset of 
randomized patient s ≥6 to <18 years of age who took at least 1 dose of study medication and were capable of 
performing a 6MW test. Changes from Day 1 to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in 6MW distance will be analyzed 
with a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM).
The primary efficacy endpoint of time to first occurrence of CW during Period 1 will be analyzed using a Cox 
proportional hazard model.  Comparisons between treatment groups will be assessed for significance at a 0.3 alpha 
level.  The incidence of CW will be summarized as the number and percentage of patients in each treatment group 
who experience at least 1 criterion of the CW definition during the study period.  A Fisher’s exact test will be used 
to compare the incidence rates.  The percentage of patient s who participate in Period 2 and who experience one of 
the CW criteria will be summarized.  In addition, c Change from Day 1 of Period 1 in 6MW distance and WHO 
functional class will be reported for all patients who participate in Period 2.
The primary eff icacy endpoint of change from baseline in 6MW distance will be analyzed using a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). Terms in the model will include visit, baseline 6MW measurement, PAH etiology, 
type of ERA therapy, and treatment group.
The proportio n of patients who experience a change in WHO functional class will be summarized. analyzed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test.   Changes will also be categorized as “worsening, “no change ,” or 
“improving” over the study period.  The percentages of patients in these categories will be summarized 
bycompared between treatment groups with a chi -square test .
Aninterim analysis of 6MW data is planned in approximately Q1 2017 when approximately 5 0% of all 
randomized patients (Period 1) have baseline and Week 24 6MWmeasurements available for analysis.   The results 
of this interim analysis will be reviewed by a data monitoring committee (DMC) to assess evidence of efficacy and 
the accuracy of studydesign assumptions.
The database will be locked ,and data collected during Period 1 will be analyzed when all randomized patients 
have ended participation in Period 1.  These results will be reported in a clinical study report.  Anaddendum to the 
initialclinical study report will be prepared at the conclusion of Period 2 to present analyses of the OLE data.
Changes from Day 1 to endpoint in hemodynamic parameters collected via echocardiogram and MRI will be 
analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) m odels.  Similarly, c hanges in log -transformed NT -Pro-BNP 
values will be analyzed with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model.
Safety:  The analy sis of safety  will include all patients who took at least 1 dose of study medication. The 
differences in the per centages of patients experiencing AEs across various criteria (for example, treatment -
emergent, treatment -related, serious, etc.) will be summarized assessed by Fisher’s exact tests .
Changes from Day 1 in clinical laboratory measurements, biomarker (inhibin B) concentrations, blood pressure, 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 84
LY450190and heart rate (HR) will be analyzed with ranked ANOVA models with a term for treatment group. Differences in 
categorical changes will be summarized assessed by Fisher’s exact tests .
Changes from Day 1 in composite intel ligence scores will be assessed according to the published instructions for 
each instrument.  The numbers and percentages of patients in each treatment group with shifts in Tanner stage at 
Year 1 and Year 2 will be summarized.  
Health Outcomes :  An ANCOVA analysis will be used to examine changes from Day 1 to Weeks 16 and 24 in 
CHQ-PF28 scores.  Patient outcome will be assessed using the CGI -I at Weeks 16 and 24 (Visits 7 and 9) using an 
ordinal scale with 7 response categories ranging from “Very Much Bett er” to “Very Much Worse”.  Responses will 
also be grouped into 3 derived categories (“Worse”, “No Change”, and “Better”) for additional analysis.  The 
proportion of patients in each of the 7 response categories and each of the 3 derived categories will be summarized 
by treatment group.  Differences between treatment groups will be tested using a CMH test.
Pharmacokinetics :  Plasma tadalafil concentration -time data will be pooled and evaluated using a population PK 
approach.  The effects of body weight, age, and sex on apparent clearance (CL/F) will be explored.  If the number 
of patients taking different types of ERA is sufficient to quantify the effect of ERA on apparent clearance, then this 
will also be done.  Due to random PK sampling times and the low nu mber of samples available from each 
individual patient, it may be necessary to combine the data from this study with the densely sampled data from 
Study LVIG to better characterize the population PK of tadalafil in this patient population.

5. Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertensio n (PAH) is a rare, chronic and progressive disease characterized 
by elevated pulmo naryartery pressure and pulmo nary vascular resistance, leading to right -heart 
failure and death (Rich 1998; Barst 2004).  PAH can be further classified into idiopathic PAH, 
heritable PAH, and associated PAH.  Conditions that are associated with PAH include 
connective tissue diseases (particularly systemic sclerosis and lupus), congenital heart disease, 
portal hypertensio n, human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) i nfection, and so me drugs 
(particularly anorexi gens).
Therapies that are currently approved for the trea tment of PAH in adults, in various geographies 
around the world, include prostacy clin and its analogues (epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, and 
beraprost), the endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) (bosentan and ambrisentan), and the 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil).
While PAH is more commo n in the adult populat ion, it does occur in children with a similar, if 
not worse, prognosis wit hout treatment.  However, with treatment the outcome appears better in 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 85
LY450190children than in adults.  Due to limited clinical data in children, treatment decisio ns are 
extrapolated from adult studies. Similar clinical strategies fro m adults have been suggested for 
the management of PAH in children ,but these guidelines must be used wit h caution 
(McLaughlin et al. 2009a).  Currently, no therapies are bosentan is the only approved drugfor 
the treatment of pediatric patients with PAH in the United States (US).  In the European Unio n 
(EU), bosentan and s Sildenafil is the only drug that has beena reapproved in the European 
Union (EU) for the treatment of pediatric PAH patients for the same pediatric indication .There is 
a growing body  of evidence supporti ng the use of therapies approved in adults ,that has led to 
widespread off -label use (Beghetti 2009).  There is a need, therefore, to provide physicians with 
safety and efficacy results o f all treatment options, including tadalafil, in the pediatric 
population.
Tadalafil is an orally administered, potent, and selective PDE5 inhibitor that has been 
investigated at doses of 2.5 mg to 100 mg (predominant ly in adult m en at doses of 10 mg and 
20mg on-demand, and 2.5 mg and 5 mg taken once daily).  Tadalafil is current ly approved in the 
US, EU, and Japan for the treatment of erectile dysfunct ion (ED), bo th on-demand and once 
daily.  Tadalafil is the active ingredient of Adcirca ®, that was recently approved for the treatment 
of PAH (pulmo nary hypertensi on Group 1) in adults in the EU, US, Canada, and Japan.  
Tadalafil was also approved for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the US.
PAH is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide (NO) due to little or no expressio n of NO 
synthase in the vascular endothelium o f pulmonary arteries (Giaid and Saleh 1995).  PDE5 is the 
predominant pho sphodiesterase isoenzyme in the pulmo nary vasculature.  As such, PDE5 
inhibition potentiates the ni tric oxide-mediated pulmo nary vasodilator and antiproliferative 
effects in patients (adults and children) with PAH.
The safety and efficacy  of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in adults have been investigated in a 
16-week placebo controlled study  (Study H6D-MC-LVGY [LVGY]) which demonstrated that, 
tadalafil 40-mg once-daily dosing is effect ive in the treatment of adult patients with PAH and is 
associated with an increase in exercise capabilit y.  Tadalafil 40mg was well tolerated in the 
adult PAH pati ent populati on with a safety profile similar to that observed in the ED patient 
population.
There is limited experience wit h regards to the safety , tolerability,and efficacy of tadalafil in 
pediatric PAH pat ients.  A recent report on tadalafil in children with PAH has demonstrated that 
tadalafil was well -tolerated in this pat ient population (Takatsuki et al. 2012).  In a company -
sponsored clinical trial, a single 14-year-old female pati ent (73 kg) received tadalafil 2.5 mg in 
Study LVGY.  Thi s patient completed Study  LVGY and subsequently enrolled in the extensio n 
Study H6D-MC-LVGX (LVGX), in which she received tadalafil 40 mg.
It has been suggested that the clini cal course of PAH in children is less predictable than in adult s.  
If untreated, the condit ion may progress more rapidly in children, leading to reduced survival in 
children than in adult s over time.  Importantly , the safet y and efficacy o f PAH therapies 
approved for adults have not been robustly established in pediatric patients due to limited data in 
children.  Given the efficacy and safet y results of tadalafil for the treatm ent of PAH in adults 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 86
LY450190(Study LVGY), and recogni zing the importance of providing pr escribers and pat ients with 
recommendat ions reflecting tadalafil experience across developmental stages, Lilly is pursuing 
the development of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in pat ients, aged ≥6months to <18 years.
This study , H6D-MC-LVHV (LVHV), is a phase 3, internat ional, rando mized, double -blind 
(Period 1), placebo-controlled (Peri od 1) add -on (in addit ion to the pati ent’s current ERA) study  
to explore the efficacy, safet y, and populat ion pharmacokinet ics (PK) of tadalafil administered 
orally once daily  in children wi th PAH.  Pati ents will receive study  drug for 6months in the 
double-blind period (Period 1), and will then be eligible to enroll into an open -label 2-year 
extension period (Period2). 
Study LVHV wil l include children who, at the time of screening, are ≥6months of age and 
<18years of age.  Patients will be stratified into 3 weight cohorts (Heavy -weight, ≥40kg; 
Middle-weight, ≥25kg to <40 kg; and Light -weight, <25kg), and then rando mized to tadala fil or 
placebo.  The dose of each weight cohort in this study will be established and may  be redefined 
based on safet y monitoring committee (SMC) and Sponsor review o f the PK and safet y results 
from Study H6D-MC-LVIG (LVIG).  Study  LVIG is an open -label, multiple ascending- dose 
study to evaluate the safet y and PK of tadalafil administered orally as a tablet or suspensio n to 
children with PAH. Study LVIG includes 2 study  periods: PK/safet y (Period 1) and an open -
label safet y extension (Period 2).  The prima ry objective of Peri od 1 of Study  LVIG is to 
characterize the PK o f tadalafil in a pediatri c populati on with PAH. The object ives of Period 2 
are to evaluate the long -term safety of tadalafil as well as clinical  worsening (CW) of PAH in 
this patient population.
The study  design for thi s study was developed to treat pediatric patients who are on stable PAH 
therapy of an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) as standard of care instead of PAH 
treatment-naïve patients, as that is seen as unethical by the prescr ibing community, and has the 
agreement of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency 
(EMA).  The primary  efficacy measure will be 6-minute wal k distance(6MWD) distancefor US 
regulatory assessment, and time to CW for EU regulatory assessment .  Safety will be assessed 
using spontaneously  reported adverse events (AEs), vital signs, laboratory  analytes, 
electrocardi ograms (ECGs), eye examinat ions,and concomitant medicat ions.
More detailed informat ion about the known benefits and risk s of tadalafil may be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .

7.Investigational Plan
7.1Summary of Study Design
FigureLVHV.7.1illustrates the study  design and the respect ive study periods. The Study  
Schedule is in Attachment 1.
This is a Phase 3, internat ional, randomized mult icenter, 2-period, double -blind (Period 1), 
placebo-controlled (Period 1), add -on (ie, in addit ion to the patient’s current ERA) study  to 
evaluate the efficacy , safety, and population PK of tadalafil in pediatric patients with PAH.
Study LVHV will enroll pediatric PAH pat ients ≥6months to <18 years of age with WHO 
functional class II or III ( Attachment 8) andwho are already receiving treatment with an ERA.  
Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or active drug in a 1:1 ratio, based on 
weight cohort, PAH eti ology, and type of ERA.  Patients will receive study  treatmentfor 
6months in the double -blind period (Period 1), and then will be eligible to enroll into an open-
label 2-year extension period (Period 2) during which pat ients will receive tadalafil.
At least134 34patients will be rando mly assigned to treatment in Period 1 of this study .  To 
achieve a representative distribut ion of patients’ ages, enrollment will be mo nitored throughout 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 88
LY450190the study to achieve ≥50% ≥30% of all patients < 12years of age and ≥20% of all pat ients < 
6years of age .
Patients entering the study will be stratified into 1 of 3 weight -cohorts, based on the patient’s 
weight at the time of the Screening visit:
Heavy-weight:  ≥40kg
Middle-weight:  ≥25kg to <40 kg
Light-weight:  <25 kg
If a patient’s weight changes during Period 1, such that he/ she falls into a different weight 
cohort, he/she will cont inue to receive the study  drug dose appropriate to his/her original weight 
cohort.
Patients will also be stratified by  type of ERA (bosentan or other) and PAH etiology .
If a patient will be participating in Period 2, and if that patient’s weight changes at the conclusio n 
of Period 1 (at the Visit9 or Early Terminat ion visit) or during Period 2, such that he/she falls 
into a different wei ght cohort (defined as at least 1 kg above or below the weight cohort 
thresholds of 25 kg and 40 kg), then the patient’s dose of study  drug may be adjusted so that they  
are receiving the appropriate weight cohort -related dose.
Dose selection for this study will be based on pediatri c PK and safet y data from  Study LVIG and 
the PK and safet y data from  the adult PAH devel opment plan.  The sel ected dose for each weight 
cohort will reflect exposures comparable to the approved 40- mg dose of tadalafil in adult s, 
unless unexpected safet y concerns unique to the pediatric population are revealed.  Dosing of all 
weight cohorts is also described in Section 9.
…
7.2.Discussion of Design and Control
Study H6D-MC-LVHV (LVHV) is a Phase 3, internat ional, randomized, mult icenter, 2-period, 
double-blind and placebo -controlled (Period 1), add -on study (in addition to the patient’s current 
ERA) to evaluate tadalafil efficacy , safety, and popul ation PK in pediatric patients wit h PAH.  A 
multicenter trial is necessary  to accrue the required number of pediatric patients with PAH to 
adequately  characteri ze the efficacy and safet y of tadalafil in this patient popul ation in a timely 
manner.  The efficacy  and safet y of tadalafil will be compared with that of pl acebo group during 
Period 1.
This study  design requi res patients to be receiving an ERA (such as bosentan or ambrisentan), 
and allows for the use of conventional PAH therapies (see Section 8.1).  Endothelin receptor 
antagonists are required, as there are sufficient data available in the adult populat ion to 
reasonably  predict safet y with ERA therapy  (Study LVGY).  A placebo-only treatment arm is 
not being proposed for this study , as assigning pediatric PAH pat ients to treatment with placebo 
alone may be viewed as unethical .  To ensure that treatment assignment is balanced wit hin type 
of ERA, rando mization to treatm ent will be stratif ied by type of ERA (bosentan or other).
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 89
LY450190Stratificat ion by PAH etio logy is justified, as the prognosis o f patients with PAH is, in part, 
dependent on etiology .  For exam ple, patients with PAH associ ated with connective tissue 
disease have a worse prognosis than patients with idiopathic PAH, while pat ients with PAH 
associated with congenital heart disease have a better survival (Kähler and Co lleselli 2006;
McLaughlin et al. 2004 ). 
Randomization stratified by weight is considered reasonable to ensure an appro priate distribution 
of treatments within weight cohorts.  Historically, male and female pediatric growth charts could 
be globally applied to clinical research based on common weight and age patterns; however, 
these may not be applicable to pediatric patien ts with PAH due to differences in disease 
conditions and due to a modest divergence in body weight and age patterns across geographies.  
Therefore, treatment randomizat ion will be stratified by  weight cohort.
This study  is designed to evaluate the efficacy of tadalafil compared with placebo in pediatric 
patients with PAH.  For the US regulatory  agency, tT he primary efficacy endpo int will be the 
change from Baseline (Day  1) to Week 24 in6MW distance assessed in those patients who are 
≥6years of age at Day  1 (Visit2) and are developmentally  capable of performing the test .  For 
the EU regulatory  agency, the primary endpoint will be the time to CW through Week 24 .
Due to the expected low mortalit y event rate in this populat ion, mortality rate is not considere d 
an appropriate primary endpo int in PAH studies; therefore, the use of a composite endpo int to 
define CW (Section 10.1.2) will provide more statistical power to detect a therapeutic effect in a 
limited sample populat ion with limited individual event rates (Ventetuol o et al. 2008).  The 
proposed definit ion of CW endpo int (Section10.1.2) is similar to that used in other trials and 
takes into account a recent publicat ion that offered recommendations based on historical review 
of PAH studi es on CW as an endpo int (McLaughlin et al. 2009b).  While the frequency of events 
of CW in pat ients with mild or moderate functional class (II, III) are expected to be low after 
16weeks, evaluat ion of this endpo int at 24 weeks (6 months) will increase the likelihood of 
detecting a treatment effect ( Rubin et al. 2002) .
Exercise capacit y is an important prognostic indicator of PAH (Miyamoto et al. 2000). The 
distance wal ked during a 6MW test i s the most accepted PAH exercise capacit y test,as it is 
simple, well tolerated, and non- invasive (Peacock et al. 2010) and has therefore been the most 
commonly used clinical  trial endpoint for PAH patients ≥6years of age (Haworth and Beghetti 
2010).For Study  LVHV, it isexpected thatapproximately 75% of the 134 34enrolled pat ients 
will be 6 years of age or older who are developmentally capable of performing the 6MW test. 
The change in 6MW Ddistancecompared with placebo will  be evaluated up to Week 24.

12.Sample Size and Statistical Methods
12.1.Determination of Sample Size
Two different primary endpo intsThe primary efficacy measure is 6MW D andwill be evaluated 
in this study  during Peri od 1.  For the US regulatory assessment, the primary efficacy measure is 
6MW distance.  For the EU regulatory  assessment, the primary  efficacy measure is time to first 
occurrence of CW.
Atotal of 134 At least 34patients will be stratified by weight and rando mized in a 1:1 ratio to 
tadalafil or placebo trea tment in this study  (67 17to placebo treatment and 67 17to tadalafil 
treatment).  The statistical significance of each endpoint will be established using separate error -
spending funct ions.
The sample size of 134 rando mized pat ients will provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 
3.6 in time to first incidence of CW during the 24 week Period 1 follow-up.  This estimate is 
based on a two -sided 0.3 significance level, an assumpt ion of an exp onential parameter of 0.0271 
for the placebo treatm ent group (that i s, an estimated placebo event rate for CW during Period 1 
of 15% and an estimated tadalafil event rate for CW during Period 1 of 4.4%) and a commo n 
exponential censoring parameter for both treatment groups of 0.0176 (that is, an est imated 
discontinuat ion rate for causes other than CW during Period 1 of 10%).
With 2 patients not having postbaseline 6MWD, A a sample size of 134 32randomized patients 
is assumed to beto include at least 96 pat ients (48 per treatment arm ) who are ≥6 to <18 years of 
age andwho are devel opmentally able to com plete the 6MW Dtest.This sample size will provide 
71% power to detect a placebo -adjusted mean difference in change in 6MWD of 40 meters with 
a standard deviation of 60 m etersand a two- sided significance l evel of 0.2 .These data will 
provide 80% power to detect a placebo -adjusted mean difference in change in 6MW distance of 
35 m with a standard deviat ion of 60 m and a two- sided significance l evel of 0.05.
12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans
The Statistical Analysis Plan will include additionaldetails regarding the statist ical analyses of 
datafrom this study.
12.2.1. General Considerations
Efficacy analyses of Period 1 data, except 6MW measurements, will include all patients who 
were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study  medication.  The analysis o f 6MW data will 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 93
LY450190include only  the subset of randomized pat ients ≥6 to <18 years of age wh o took at l east 1 dose of 
study medication and were able to perform a 6MW test.  Patients will be analyzed according to 
the randomized treatment assignment.  Patients with no post Day 1data for a particular efficacy 
endpoint will be excluded fro m the analysis of that endpoint.  Additional sensitivity analyses 
utilizing imputed values for missing post Day 1 data may be conducted for specific endpoints.  
Safety analyses will include all rando mized pat ients who took at least 1 dose of study  
medication.
All efficacy measures will be summarized by descript ive statist ics for each treatm ent group.  For 
continuous variables, summary  statistics will include the number of observat ions, mean, median, 
minimum and maximum values, and standard deviation or standard error .  For categorical 
variables, counts and percentages will be tabulated for each category .  The 25thpercentile, 
median and 75thpercentile will be presented for variables that are analyzed using rank -
transformed data.
Results of statistical hypothesis test s will be reported using two -sided p-values, unless otherwise 
specified for a particular endpoint. Given the small sample size, no formal co mparison will be 
made between treatment groups. Hence, the overall treatment difference p -value and the visit -
wise p-values will not be reported.

12.2.6.Primary Outcome and Methodology
The primary  efficacy endpoint for the US regulatory  assessment ofchange fro m baseline (Day  1) 
in 6MW distance will be analyzed at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 with a mixed effects model 
for repeated m easures (MMRM).  This analysis will include only  patients who are ≥6to <18 
years of age and are developmentally able to complete 6MW testing during Period 1.  Factors in 
the MMRM model include visit, baseline 6MWD, PAH etio logy, type of endothelin receptor 
antagonist (ERA) therapy ,and treatment group.  Wit hin the model, the effect of PAH etio logy 
will only be included if there are at least 3 patients per treatment arm at each PAH et iology level.  
Similarly, the effect of ERA therapy  will only be included if there are at least 3 patients per 
treatment arm at each ERA therapy  level.Terms in the m odel will include visit, baseline ( Day 1)
6MW distance, PAH etio logy, type of ERA therapy , and treatment group.  Treatm ent effects will 
be reported as least -squares means and associated confidence intervals with the overall treatment 
effect p-value interpreted for evidence of efficacy. 
The primary  efficacy endpoint for the EU regulatory  assessment of time to first occurrence of 
CW (Secti on10.1.1)during Period 1 will be analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model.  
The analysis model will include terms for weight cohort, PAH etio logy, type of ERA therapy , 
and treatment group.  Comparisons between treatment groups will be assessed for significan ce at 
a 0.3 alpha level.  
As the study  has a limited number of pat ients enrolled, an inspect ion of the modelmean change 
in 6MWD and corresponding CIs will be used instead of significance testing to ensure whether 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 94
LY450190they are trending in the right direct ion.  The overall treatment difference p -value and the visi t-
wise p-values will not be reported. Kaplan-Meier plots of the proportion of patients without CW 
over time will be presented for all subjects and by treatment group and weight cohort.   Analyses 
of CW will use adjudicated data reported by the CEC.
Theseobjectives will be analyzedassessedand results reported at the end of Period 1.
12.2.7.Efficacy Analyses
Secondary  and additional efficacy  endpoints will  include all  patients who were randomized to 
treatment and took at least 1 dose of study  medication.
The proporti on of patients who experience a change in WHO funct ional class will be 
summarized. analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test.   Changes will also be 
categorized as “worsening, “no change,” or “improving” over the study  period.  The percentages 
of patients in these categories will be compared between treatment groups with a chi -square test.
The incidence of CW (Section 10.1.2) will be summarized as the number and percentage of 
patients in each treatm ent group who experience at least one criterion of the CW definit ion 
during the study  period.  A Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare the incidence rates.  
Changes fro m Day 1to endpoint in hemod ynamic param eters collected via echocardi ography
and MRI will be analyzed wit h analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models.  Models will include 
terms for Day 1value, weight cohort, PAH etio logy, type of ERA therapy, and treatment group.
These object ives will be analyzed and results reported at the end of Period 1.  No adjust ments for 
multiple comparisons will be made for the analysis of these endpo ints.
During Peri od2, the incidence and time to first occurrence of CW during Period 2 will be 
assessed.  The percentage of patients who particip ate in Period2 and who experience one of the 
CW criteria will be summarized.  In addit ion, change fro m Day 1of Period1 in 6MW and WHO 
functional class will be reported for all pat ients who participate in Period 2.
Changes fro m Day 1in NT-Pro-BNP values will be analyzed wit h an analysis o f variance 
(ANOVA) model.  NT- Pro-BNP values will be log -transformed for analysis.  Day 1values for 
NT-Pro-BNP concentrations will be the last value collected prior to randomized treatment 
assignment at Day  1 (Visit2).

12.2.9.Health Outcome/Quality of Life Analyses
An ANCOVA analysis will be used to examine changes fro m Day 1to Weeks 16 and 24 in 
CHQ-PF28 scores.  The models will include terms for Day 1score, Day 1value, weight cohort, 
PAH etio logy, type of ERA therapy, and treatment group.
Patient outcom e will be assessed using the CGI -I at Weeks 16 and 24 (Visits 7 and 9) using an 
ordinal scale with 7 response categories ranging from “Very Much Better” to “Very Much 
H6D-MC-LVHV(c) Clinical Protocol Page 95
LY450190Worse.”.  Responses will also be grouped i nto 3 derived categories (“Worse ,”,“No Change ,”,
and “Better”) for addit ional analysis.  The proportion of pat ients in each of the 7 response 
categories and each of the 3 derived categories will be summarized by  treatment group.   
Differences between treatment groups will be tested using a CMH test.
12.2.10.Safety Analyses
Safety during Peri od1 will be assessed through AEs including abnormalit ies detected by  ECG or 
physical examinat ion, clinical chemistry  and hematol ogy panels, urinalysis, vital signs, ey e 
examinations, and concomitant medicat ions.  During Period 2, safety will be m onitored using 
AEs, changes in body  weight and height, inhibin B bio marker (male pat ients only), eye 
examinations, Tanner scale, and intelligence tests.  The analysis o f safety willinclude all pat ients 
who took at l east 1 dose of study  medication.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
preferred term.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as events that first occurred or 
worsened after the first dose of study medicat ion on Day 1 (Visit 2).  Treatm ent-related adverse 
events are defined as events that are determined to be possibly or probably treatment -related by  
the Investigator.  The differences in the percentages of patient s experiencing AEs across various 
criteria (for example, treatment- emergent, treatment -related, serious, etc.) will be displayed by 
treatment groups analyzed using Fisher’s exact test .
Changes fro m Day 1in clinical laboratory  measurements, inhibin B bio marker concentrati ons, 
blood pressure, and HR will be analyzed wit h ranked ANOVA models with a term for treatment 
group.  Observed laboratory  values and changes from Day 1in laboratory  values will be 
evaluated for categorical changes based on normal ranges and displayed by  treatment groups .  
Differences in categorical changes will be assessed by  Fisher’s exact tests.  Changes fro m Day 1
in composite intelligence scores will be assessed according to the published instructions for each 
instrument.  The numbers and percentages of patients in each treatment group with shifts in 
Tanner stage at Year 1 and Year 2 will be summarized.  Day 1values for laboratory  data, vital 
signs, body  weight and height, inhibin B bio marker, Tanner scale, and intelligence tests will be 
the last value scollected prior to randomized treatment assignment at Day 1 (Visit 2).
12.2.11.Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses will be conducted as deemed appropriate and necessary.  Detailed 
descriptionsof the subgroup variables will be provided in the statistical analysis plan .
Additional analyses will examine time to first incidence of CW and change in 6 MW distance 
within subgroups defined by  weight cohort, ERA type, and PAH etiology .  The subgroup -by-
treatment interacti on p-values will be exa mined to determine if there is evidence that treatment 
effects change across levels o f the specified subgroup.  Addit ional analyses of wit hin subgroup 
treatment effects m ay be perform ed to invest igate and quant ify significant interactions.
This study  is not powered to detect differences wit hin these subgroups.  As such, all results of 
subgroup analyses will be considered exploratory .

Abstract:  
Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains one of the most prevalent and successful surgical 
procedures performed on patients seeking return to function fr om arthritic pain.  Effective pain 
control is critical after surgery to permit earlier mobilization, maximize patient satisfaction, 
and facilitate outpatient surgery. Multimodal analgesia protocols are the back bone for post -
operative functional recovery after TJA , and efforts to optimize these protocols with new FDA 
approved medications remain of significant importance. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a recent  FDA approved medication: bupivacaine +low dose meloxicam 
extended release (ER) solution  (HTX -011) , for post -operative pain control after total knee 
arthroplasty. This is a 1:1 randomized, single blinded, clinical trial studying this new medication against our institution’s standard of care arthroplasty block cocktail. Patients will be randomized by dynamic allocation into treatment and active control groups. The primary 
outcome of interest is pain control over 72 hours after surgery collected through pain diaries recording an 11 -point numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 -10. These scores will be comput ed as 
area under the pain curve at 24, 48 and 72 hours, and standardized by daily morphine 
equivalents required to arrive at our end points. Additional endpoints include distance walked with PT at discharge, , length of stay in the hospital, and adverse events.  We hypothesize that this new medication will provide superior analgesia at 72 hours and reduced opioid consumption, in comparison to our current standard of care.

1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the procedures described in this protocol, applicable U nited States  
government regulations and Mayo Clinic policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
Total joint arthroplasty remains one of the most prevalent and successful surgical 
procedures performed on patients seeking return to function fr om arthritic pain.  Effective pain 
control is critical after surgery to permit earlier mobilization, maximize patient satisfaction, 
and facilitate outpatient surgery.

Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL   As advancements in medicine and surgery continue to progress, more emphasis is being 
placed on earl ier ambulation following surgery as it has been shown to improve outcomes  and 
decrease hospital length of stay and decrease  total cost of care.1-3. Optimizing peri operative 
pain control is crucial to achieving these goals.  
Current practice for perioperative pain management during TKA involves the use of 
multimodal analgesia (MMA) . MMA  includes multiple oral and IV medications tasked with 
blocking sensory input around the knee for a period around the indexed surgery4. Together, 
MMA protocols are designed to reduce the need for opioids, decrease postoperative pain 
intensity and encourage earlier discharges . These effects drive down costs  of care. Included 
with these medications are periarticular injections, which have proven effective in achieving 
both pain intensity and functional improvement after surgery.5 While multiple agents have 
been tested in practice including bupivacaine hydrochloride and ropivacaine as components to MMA protocols, observed effects are often limited to approximately 8 to 12 hours post -
operative
6. More recently, certain bupivacaine liposomal emulsions designed to have 
prolonged effect have been tested with conflicting evidence reported in their efficacy compared to “shorter acting” substances beyond 24 hours
7. Thus, continuing to examine new medications 
and optimize MMA protocols is an important ongoing pursuit both from a quality 
improvement, patient outcome, and cost effectiveness point of view. 
Recently, the FDA approved a new periarticular extended release (ER) solution 
consisting of low dose meloxicam + bupivacaine for total knee arthroplasty pain control. Their decision is based on the results of a recent Phase 2b clinical trial investigating this drug against standard local periarticular analgesic options.
4 In this Phase 2 clinical trial, 232 patients 
undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia were studied,

Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  and the authors’ results ultimately demonstrated that the unique, needle -free, instillation  of 
400mg bupivacaine/12mg meloxicam  ER solution  intraarticularly prior to closure provide d 
superior pain reduction out to 72 hours following TKA compared to placebo and  active control 
groups. Bupivacaine + meloxicam ER solution (HTX -011, Zynrelef)  is FDA -approved for 
three specific surgical indications: bunionectomy, herniorrhaphy, and total knee arthroplasty, 
with the FDA approval stemming from primarily industry involved studies4,8,9.  N otable 
benefits included prolonged duration of pain control out to 72 hours postoperative and a 
concomitant decrease in opioid requirements after surgery10.  
The primary goal of this study is to investigate whether this medication will improve 
patient care at our institution by conducting the first, non- industry supported, randomized, 
single- blinded clinical trial comparing bupivacaine + low dose meloxicam ER solution to our 
institutional standard practice arthroplasty block cocktail  during total knee arthroplasty by 
providing superior analgesia through 72 hours. Our second goal is to evaluate the impact of 
this medication on patient opioid consumption after surgery and return to ambulation end 
points in comparison to our standard of care. We hypothesize that this medication will provide 
improved pain control at 72 hours post- operative resulting in less consumption of opioids and 
improved ambulation at 72 hours compared to our current standard of care. However, these effects may be associated with a significant increase in cost of care.

due to a proprietary polymer based formulation with prolonged elusion pharmacokinetics. It is found to be safe, with  existing  clinical studies suggesting its most common side effects 
being headache, nausea and constipation
4,8,9.  
 
1.2 Clinical Data to Date  
Recently, the FDA approved this  new periarticular pain medication, low dose 
meloxicam + bupivacaine ER solution  for total knee arthroplasty pain control, bunionectomy 
and open inguinal herniorraphy4,8,9. For total knee arthroplasty (TKA) , this approval  decision 
is based on the results of a recent clinical trial investigating this drug against local periarticular 
analgesic options  (active control) and placebo groups .4 In th at Phase 2 clinical trial, 232 
patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia were 
studied, and the authors’ results ultimately demonstrated that the application of the study drug, 
400mg bupivacaine/12mg meloxicam  ER solution, intraarticularly prior to closure of a 
standard TKA midline incision provides superior pain reduction through 72 hours following TKA compared to their placebo or active control groups. The recent  FDA approval of this new 
analgesic medicat ion stemmed from primarily industry involved studies, with notable benefits 
being prolonged duration of pain control out to 72 hours postoperative and a concomitant decrease in opioid requirements after surgery
10. Importantly, we asked our pharmacist to 
critically review the safety of single shot adductor canal blocks , spinal anesthesia, and local 
skin anesthetic  in patients receiving this study medication. Nathaniel Brinkman, Pharm D., 
RPh, provided a critical analysis of the dosing of this medication, plasma concentrations and

  Version 2.0 
   
 
Page 12 of 51 
Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  concluded that it is safe to use a single shot adductor canal block plus spinal for patients 
receiving bupivacaine + low dose meloxicam ER solution. His decision is based on available clinical information  which is outlined as follows . Inter -patient variability aside, pertinent data 
points include a local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) from bupivacaine is thought to occur around 2,000ng/mL. Concentration max for HTX -011 400mg in TKA was 695 ng/mL, which 
was reached at 21 hours per the package insert. A poster by Yamamoto et al . included a range 
of 368- 1,550 ng/mL (mean 710 ng/mL) in mammoplasty , i.e. not an intra articular use, which 
reached max concentration at 3.58 hours (1.27- 34.58). Median plasma concentration for 
combination spinal and single shot femoral blockade was 538 ng/mL (range, 176-1,384 ng/mL)
11. The theoretical max if all serum concentration maximums were reached at the same 
time would be 2,079 ng/mL, however the intra articular instillation and prolonged elution of 
this medication protects against simultaneous serum peak concentrations. This extends to the 
use of 75 mg bupivacaine as a local skin anesthetic during closure as is the preference of senior 
author MPA. Local use of bupivacaine in this manner will result in a peak between 200-300 ng/mL at approximately 60 minutes, but the time  to peak was identified as variable. Dr. 
Brinkman expects the combination of spinal anesthesia, adductor blockade and skin infiltration of bupivacaine will have a cumulative peak of 800- 900 ng/mL within the 30-120- minute  
timeframe, well before the bupivacaine +low dose meloxicam ER solution instilled intra articularly peaks, and below the 2,000 ng/mL toxicity threshold.

Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  The overall objective of this study is to investigate whether or not this new FDA approved 
medication is a viable addition to the Mayo Clinic formulary to improve the quality of patient care following total knee arthroplasty. To this end, we will examine pain at 72 hours as our primary outcome. Secondarily, we will also investigate pain at 48 hours in the study versus control group. Pain at 24 hours will be compared between groups as a tertiary goal, while recognizing that the study medication is reported to differentiate itself through its extended duration of effects. We w ill collect opioid use information and monitor for standard safety 
parameters after total knee surgery post- operative. The anticipated duration for complete data 
collection to analysis is one year.  
 2.1 Primary Objective  
 This investigation constitutes a comparative study involving the first non-industry funded investigation of the use of a recently FDA approved periarticular pain medication for controlling postoperative pain following total knee arthroplasty.   Primary Objective  
 To assess the effectiveness of bupivacaine +meloxicam periarticular ER solution in 
controlling postoperative pain out to 72 hours in subjects receiving primary total knee arthroplasty compared to standard arthroplasty block controls.  2.2 Secondary Objective

Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  Secondary outcomes will be evaluating pain control at 24 and 48 hours, total post- operative 
opioid consumption (standardized into MMEs), hospital length of stay, adverse reactions or 
events, distance walked at time of discharge with PT.  
2.1.1 Study Rationale 
Based on available literature, periarticular bupivacaine + low dose meloxicam ER solution has been demonstrated as a new  and safe means of providing prolonged patient analgesia 
after total knee arthroplasty. Its novelty is in both its formulation and needle- free instillation. 
As the available studies to date examining this medication are industry-funded, the primary rationale for examining this FDA approved medication at our institution is to provide an unbiased evaluation of this new medication in the setting of quality improvement initiatives to our institution’s patient care. Multimodal analgesia (MMA) is critical to achieving better 
outcomes after total joint arthroplasty, as it has been shown to decrease hospital length of 
stay through earlier ambulation and patient satisfaction. It also has the benefit of reducing narcotic consumption postoperatively. Continuing to evaluate optimal protocols and new medications for MMA consideration remains of significant value.   Various means of controlling post-operative pain are currently employed at Mayo Clinic. Standard arthroplasty block is a cocktail of multiple medications instilled with a needle prior to closure of total knee arthroplasties. In 100cc of our current  formulation, there is 225mg of 
ropivacaine 5mg/mL, 0.6mg epinephrine 1mg/mL, 30mg ketorolac 30mg/mL diluted in sodium chloride. While effective at controlling patients’ pain intensity postoperatively, ropivacaine’s post- operative analgesic effects are recognized to last for less than 24 hours. As

RCT  
  Version 2.0 
   
 
Page 17 of 51 
Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  the pain following total knee arthroplasty experienced by a patient can be quite limiting at  
first, continuing to evaluate MMA protocols using new, FDA approved medications remains 
of significant value.   An essential component to a new drug reaching FDA approval is an analysis of not only the drug’s efficacy but also its safety profile. Bupivacaine + low dose meloxicam ER solution has been shown through multiple large clinical trials to be safe with its most common 
adverse effects reported as constipation, nausea and headache
4,8,9.   
 
2.1.2 Anticipated Risks  
The existing evidence on this new FDA approved medication suggests that it is safe. The 
adverse effects with >/= 10% incidence that have been reported are constipation, vomiting 
and headache. This is a single one- time intra articular dose of this medication. As such, the 
standard risks of intravenous instillation of local analgesics such as bupivacaine 
(cardiotoxicity) and meloxicam (renal, GI, bleeding and cardiovascular toxicity) are likely mitigated by the local instillation and one -time dose. Further, following thorough discussion 
with on staff pharmacy expert, Nathaniel Brinkman, Pharm D, the elution kinetics of this medication outlined in the available literature does not show brisk accumulation in serum given the local instillation and prolonged elution kinetics of the medication as detailed above in section 1.2. Thus, the drug is considered  safe with adjuvant neural blockade such as spinal 
anesthesia, single shot adductor canal block and local anesthetic instillation to skin during

includes:  
- Hypersensitivity/ allergic response 
- Hypertension 
- Renal toxicity  
- Cardiac toxicity  
- Hepatotoxicity/transaminitis  
- Methemoglobinemia 
- Heart failure and edema  
- Prolongation of postoperative bleeding 
- Drug -drug interactions with other NSAIDs, hemostasis interfering medications (e.g. 
warfarin, aspirin, SSRI/SNRIs) 
 There are also risks associated with the index surgery which are explained to every patient during their informed consent for surgery. These risks include: 
• Death  
• Fever  
• Infection  
• Damage to surrounding neurovascular or ligamentous structures during surgery 
• Stroke 
• Wound complications 
• Deep venous thrombosis or Pulmonary embolism

2.1.3 Potential Benefits  
The anticipated  benefit of this study will be identifying the effectiveness of a new FDA 
approved periarticular analgesic in a non-industry sponsored cohort of subjects receiving 
total knee arthroplasty at a single high-volume orthopedic hospital . This information will 
inform clinical practice through quality improvement initiatives as it may prove worthwhile to be incorporated into existing MMA protocols at our hospital. There is a proposed advantage of this medication having a 72 hour analgesic effect  with an associated  reduction 
in opioid requirements. 
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
• Randomized, single-blinded, standard of care group as a control, single institution, clinical trial 
• 72 hours direct patient study involvement may be contacted out to the point of publication for general follow-up.   
• Patients will be recruited for the study at their preoperative appointments. They will be randomized using a computer algorithm with dynamic allocation . They will not be 
informed as to their study group. They will receive their scheduled pTKA. They will follow up with their pain diaries over the subsequent 72-hours after which time they will return them to the investigational team with pre -paid postage.

3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints 
This is an FDA approved medication for the present indication. It is not investigational in this 
setting but is rather being evaluated for quality improvement of patient care at Mayo Clinic. As such, standard post- operative evaluation for patients who have received total joint 
arthroplasty will be utilized . This will include serial neurovascular examinations and notation 
of any complications including but not limited to unexpected ICU admissions, prolonged hospitalizations, venous thromboembolic disease, wound problems and drug hypersensitivity reactions .  
4 Subject Selection, Enrollment  and Withdrawal  
Consecutive adults greater than the age of 18 years old who have consented for this study and are receiving primary total knee arthroplasty to treat degenerative joint disease are qualified for inclusion. These subjects must all be deemed  healthy for surgery (American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical classification I to III) will be included in this randomized, controlled trial as this simulates our clinical practice population . We will exclude patients 
with contraindications to NSAIDs or bupivacaine including allergies (Type 1

4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
• ASA classification I to III older than or equal to 18 years old 
• All genders 
• Presenting for primary total knee replacement for degenerative joint disease  
• Patient capable of providing their own informed consent 
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
• Vulnerable study populations including prisoners

procedure 
• Compromised health barring the patient from proceeding with surgery  
• Patients unable to provide their own informed consent 
• Pregnancy  
• Patients with documented chronic pain syndromes 
• Patients with a history of prolonged daily opioids (more than 1 month) with an oral 
morphine equivalent of greater than 5mg/day

4.3 Subject Recruitment , Enrollment  and Screening  
Subjects will be identified as those who meet the inclusion criteria and are receiving total 
knee arthroplasty for degenerative joint disease from the clinical practices of participating high-volume adult reconstruction surgeons at the Mayo Clinic that  have agreed to participate 
in our study. We will recruit patients  at their pre -operative visit, where they will be screened 
for exclusion/inclusion  criteria and enrolled by a trained  research coordinator  at the time of 
consent for surgery. We anticipate 25 el igible patients s een in an average month, and assume 
that 70% of patients will agree to participat e. While there should be no loss to follow-up in 
this study (due to the short nature of the follow-up), we assume that up to 10% of subjects will not complete or return their pain diaries.   Thus, we expect that there will be 15 patients 
enrolled with complete  data per month. Preliminary sample size calculations (section 7.1) 
were based on previously published data. However, because of differences in the intervention and follow-up protocol in this proposed RCT , a pilot study of 10 patients following this same 
protocol using this on- formulary medication  will be conducted in a single author (MPA’s) 
clinical practice.  Five patients will rec eive HTX-011 and the other 5 patients will receive the 
standard practice pain block. The data from this pilot study will be used to refine the initial 
sample size estimate and will provide the final sample size determination for the RCT. However , the data from the pilot study will not be included in the full RCT analysis. The

Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  other advantage of the pilot study is that it will provide study personnel an opportunity to 
become familiar with the procedures and flow of subject enrollment and data collection prior to the initiation of the actual RCT. The informed consent document will contain information about the study drug (benefits and safety information), the importance of the study, and the contact information of the investigative team for any questions. At that time, the pain diary will be shown to them with specific education p rovided by the coordinator as to how to use 
the diary  (a second round of education will occur  on the day of surgery when the patient is 
done with their surgery at which time the diary will be provided to them by the coordinator). The coordinator will screen patients for  inclusion/exclusion criterion and confirm selection of 
any patient that they have questions. The coordinator will also remind patients of how to use the diary throughout their 3-day postoperative period through reminder  patient portal 
messa ges organized through Mayo Clinic. Patients will not be notified which treatment arm 
of the study they fall into as this is a single blind, randomized, controlled trial. Given the 
novel needle-free application of this medication compared to the active standard arthroplasty block control group (injection), the surgeons will not be blinded to treatment allocation, however the surgeons will not collect postoperative patient reported outcomes from the patient, who themselves will be blinded. Nurses who take care of the patients in the hospital and assist them in their initial pain diary recording will be blinded to the treatment allocation .

5 Study Device  
Bupivacaine + low dose meloxicam ER solution is a recent FDA approved medication used 
for periarticular instillation to reduce postoperative pain. Bupivacaine + low dose meloxicam 
ER solution has been approved for bunionectomy, open inguinal herniorrhaphy, and total knee arthroplasty  based on recent studies
4,8,9. Its efficacy has been described out to 72 hours 
due to a proprietary polymer design with prolonged drug elusion pharmacokinetics. Bupivacaine exerts its analgesic effect by preventing cell membrane depolarization through blocking sodium ion influx into sensory neurons. Meloxicam  is a non- steroidal  anti-
inflammatory  medication (NSAID) which exerts its effect through blockade of

Description  
Bupivacaine + low dose meloxicam ER solution is a recent FDA approved medication used for periarticular instillation to reduce postoperative pain. Bupivacaine + low dose meloxicam ER solution has been approved for bunionectomy, open inguinal herniorrhaphy, and total knee arthroplasty. Its efficacy has been described out to 72 hours due to a proprietary polymer design with prolonged elusion pharmacokinetics of its two primary ingredient reagents . The drug has been designed and manufactured by Heron Therapeut ics (Heron 
Therapeutics, San Diego, CA) for use as a multimodal analgesic local analgesic during surgery. This medication was recently  approved for formulary status in TKA at Mayo Clinic. 
Traceability will be maintained through standard institutional practice for formulary drugs administered during a patient’s hospitalizatio n. The specific purpose of the use of this 
medication in this study is to evaluate whether it provides superior analgesia for 72 hours in comparison to our standard of care. This quality improvement initiative seeks to augment the care of our patients while concomitantly evaluating  a new FDA approved medication in a 
non-industry sponsored randomized controlled trial for this purpose. This device will be used in patients who have consented for this research and do not have contraindications to receiving this medication during their indexed primary total knee arthroplasty. The goal is to

drug is administered through a novel needle- free instillation into the joint prior to closure, as 
described in the drug manual. No specific training outside of knowledge of the user manual for the medication is required.  
5.1 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
 
A study coordinator will handle subject screening,  recruitment , and informed consent in a 
patient’s preoperative appointment for indexed primary total knee arthroplasty. Upon enrollment, study patients will be assigned to the available study number.   Subjects will be randomized into one of two study groups using dynamic allocation.  To ensure the study groups are balanced on subject demographics, the subjects will be stratified 
on sex, age group (≥70 vs. <70) , and BMI (≥32 vs. <32).  Within each stratum, subjects will 
be assigned to either of the two study groups using a computerized dynamic allocation 
program housed in an online application developed by personnel in the Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics. Using dynamic allocation will ensure  that the subject allocation will 
remain balanced on the stratification factors and the study group assignment throughout the entire subject accrual phase.  This computer- based randomization system will be username 
and password protected and available only to the study personnel. The study group assignment will be concealed from the patient in this single -blind study, as the surgeon will 
instill the medication intraoperatively and cannot be blinded to it given its unique method of needle- free administration .

Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  5.2 Preparation and Administration /Impl antation  of Investigational D evice 
 
Bupivacaine +meloxicam ER formulation is intended for single dose administration only. The drug is applied without a needle into the surgical site following final irrigation and suction and prior to suturing. The recommended dose that we will incorporate is 14cc to deliver 400mg bupivacaine/12mg meloxicam. Following standard sterile practice, the prepackaged , sterile medication kit will be brought to the surgical field for instillation prior 
to closure. The medication is a viscous solution supplied as a kit consisting of single dose glass vial and the following sterile components: Luer Lock syringe, a vented vial spike, Luer Lock cone-shaped applicator(s) and syringe tip cap(s). Per the manufacturer’s complete prescribing information materials, the contents of the drug vial are sterile. The vial exterior is 
not sterile. We will follow standard institutional practice to sterilely prepare  and administer 
this medication for surgery.   
 For the control/standard of care group receiving our standard arthroplasty block cocktail, the surgeon will instill the medication as an injectate into the posterior capsule, and soft tissues, during closure.   Per the manufacturer guidelines, the complete steps to prepare the medication are the following: https://www.zynrelef.com/prescribing -information.pdf

5.3 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
 
Subjects are only required to complete and return pain diaries after surgery. Subjects who do not return a pain diary within 1 week after surgery will be contacted by the study coordinator. If a pain diary is never recovered that subject will require exclusion so as to avoid recall bias of delayed diary completion.

standardized  institutional Multimodal Analgesia Total Joint Pathway  consisting of immediate 
or controlled-release oxycodone, celecoxib and acetaminophen, unless contraindicated. Intraoperative management will include the primary anesthesia type (which will be standardized to spinal anesthesia with a single adductor canal block  consisting of 0.25% 
bupivacaine +/ - epinephrine 10cc total, as deemed safe by the treating anest hesiologist ), 
antiemetics, and supplemental analgesia as deemed necessary . No patients will receive 
Precedex , which is otherwise considered at the physician’s discretion as a component to 
MMA pathways at Mayo Clinic.  All patients will receive a posterior stabilized (PS) total 
knee arthroplasty through a medial parapatellar approach, and all procedures will be performed by high-volume, lower-extremity arthroplasty surgeons at the Mayo Clinic 
Hospital, Methodist Campus in Rochester, Minnesota.

The endpoint of pain out to 72 hours will be assessed by asking patients to record pain scores 
on a 11-point (0 -10) scale every four hours after surgery beginning POD 1 at 8AM in a pain 
diary . The pain diary set up is designed to replicate standard nursing pain score measurement  
intervals following surgery, to ensure continuity of pain scores and ease of collection. The NRS selected for this study is designed to mimic the standard orthopedic nursing pain scales used while a patient is in the hospital. POD 0 pain scores will be collected for each patient from the medical record following standard nursing practice at our institution including early post-operative assessment within one hour on arrival to the PACU, and then gradually increased intervals until q4hour standard checks are reached  for outpatients in a bed and 
inpatients . Additional outcome measures include opioid consumption during and after 
hospitalization converted to  daily oral morphine equivalents documented by either anesth esia 
or the orthopedic nursing staff while patients are inpatient, and then through the patient ’s

also be noted. After 72 hours post- operative, patients will be instructed  to return their pain 
diaries to the investigating team using pre-paid, pre stamped postage from which data will be recorded by the study coordinator.   Standard monitoring for adverse events after total knee arthroplasty will be utilized. This includes monitoring for patient falls while hospitalized, nerve injury through routine neurovascular exams, surgical site infection through physical examination or unanticipated intensive care unit admissions and drug hypersensitivity reactions.   
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
It has been shown that a reduction of 30% in NRS pain scores is associated with a meaningful benefit
12. Therefore, sample size calculations were performed to estimate the 
number of subjects needed to detect a difference of this magnitude or greater  between the 
two study groups.  In a similar study4, patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that 
received  HTX -011 + ropivacaine had a mean area under the curve (AUC) pain score from 0 
to 72 hours of 452.5 with a standard deviation of 194.1.  A difference of 136 represents a 
30% change relative to 452.5. Enrollment of 250 subjects is anticipated to allow for subject non-compliance with completing or returning the diaries. However, a ssuming similar 
variability is observed in the above proposed study, only 44 subjects  with completed diaries per group (88 total) will be required to have 90% power to detect a difference of at least 136 in the AUC of NRS pain scores from 0 to 72 hours between the two study groups.

  Version 2.0 
   
 
Page 35 of 51 
Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  To more accurately estimate the required study sample size, a small pilot study will be 
conducted to refine the above estimates. T he study PI (MPA) will randomize 10 patients 
from his practice scheduled for primary TKA to either the study medication (n=5) or the 
standard medication (n=5). The medications used, procedures followed, and data collected will be identical to those outlined for the full RCT . The data from this pilot study will be 
used to refine the initial sample size estimate and will provide the final sample size 
determination for the RCT. However, the data from the pilot study will not be included in the full RCT analysis.  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
All statistics for this randomized controlled trial will be performed by senior statistician, Dirk 
Larson, M.S. who has developed and approved the following statistical plan. The data will be 
reported descriptively using appropriate summary statistics, including means and standard 
deviations for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Where appropriate, outcomes will be reported with 95% confidence intervals. Because this is a prospective, randomized trial, no formal betwe en-group comparisons of baseline covariates 
will be performed. The primary study outcome will be  patient reported pain over 72 hours 
following total knee arthroplasty. Patients will record their pain on an 11 -point scale (0 -10 
numerical rating scale, NRS) at specified intervals over the 72 -hour period.  For each patient, 
these pain scores will be used calculate the area under the curve (AUC) representing a single measure of pain experienced over the 72- hour period
4,13.    The AUC will be calculated using 
the trapezoid rule14. Secondary outcomes will include the AUC for pain over the first 24 and 
48 hours, maximum pain reported, total post-operative opioid consumption (standardized into

therapist prior to discharge. Outcomes measured on a continuous scale will be compared 
between the 2 study groups using two- sample t -tests if the data are sufficiently normally 
distributed; otherwise non- parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used. Ordinal variables 
will be analyzed using non- parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests.  Binary and nominal 
categorical outcomes will be compared between the study groups using chi -square tests or 
Fisher’s exact tests, if low expected cell counts are observed. Analysis of the primary outcome (AUC
0-72) will be analyzed both with and without accounting for the need for opioid rescue 
medication.  The former will be performed by substituting NRS pain scores during opioid rescue medication usage with the most recent NRS pain value prior to the time of opioid rescue medication use
4. Since this is a prospective, randomized trial, subjects in the two groups are 
expected to be similar with respect to their baseline characteristics; therefore, no formal comparisons of baseline data will be performed. However, if it is determined that an a djusted 
analysis is warranted, this will be done using a general linear models framework. The primary analysis will be conducted using an intent -to-treat approach in which subjects will be analyzed 
in the groups they were randomized to, even if they actually received the intervention for the other study group.  All statistical tests will be two -sided , and the threshold of statistical 
significance will be set at α = 0.05.  
 Handling of Missing Data If a subject ’s pain diary is missing a recording of their pain level or opioid consumption at a 
particular four hour time point after POD 1, we will assess the quality of the rest of the data provided. If sufficient data is deemed available for inclusion, missing NRS pain scores will

Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  be imputed using the last observation carried forward approach. Missing opioid consumption 
data will not be imputed.  If insufficient data is presented  the subject  will be excluded from 
the analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted by performing the analysis of the primary outcome after excluding any subjects for whom any NRS pain scores were imputed.   Multiplicity  
Given the study design and outcome definitions, multiplicity will not be an issue.  The serial NRS pain scores will be converted into a single measure of pain as the area under the curve (AUC) over the 72 -hour period. All other outcomes will also be recorded as a single value 
for each subject. The analysis will entail comparison of the outcomes between the two study groups.  Therefore, there will be no analyses involving multiple comparisons.  
 
Primary Hypothesis:  The primary research hypothesis is that subjects randomized to bupivacaine + meloxicam ER solution instilled periarticular at the time of total knee arthroplasty will have superior analgesia over the first 72 hours post- surgery  compared to subjects r andomized to standard  
arthroplasty block.   This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the area under the curve (AUC) for numerical rating scale (NRS) of pain over the first 72 hours following surgery between the two study groups using two- sample t- tests if the data are sufficiently normally distributed , or non-
parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests  if a high degree of non-normality is observed.  The 
primary analysis will be conducted using an intent- to-treat approach in which subjects will be

intervention for the other study group. A secondary per-protocol analysis may also be performed.  
 Secondary Hypothesis:   
The secondary research hypotheses include the following. 
• Subjects randomized to HTX-011 will have lower mean NRS pain score area under 
the curve from 0 to 48 hours post-surgery compared to subjects randomized to the 
standard arthroplasty block.  
• Subjects randomized to HTX-011 will have lower opioid consumption in the 72 hours 
post- surgery   compared to subjects randomized to the standard arthroplasty block.  
• Subjects randomized to HTX-011 will be able to walk farther - prior to discharge than 
subjects randomized to the standard arthroplasty block.  
The secondary hypotheses will be compared between the two study groups using two- sample 
t-tests; however, if the data are not sufficiently normally distributed for any of these 
outcomes, the comparisons will be performed using non- parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests.   
 Interim Analysis  
Inasmuch as patient accrual is expected to be rapid and the study follow-up period is only 3 days post-surgery, an interim analysis is not likely to be beneficial. Therefore, no interim analysis will be performed.

All subjects randomized into this study, in either the treatment or standard of care group  will 
enter this analysis .  Thus, the primary analysis will be performed using an intent- to-treat 
approach.  I t is not anticipated that many patients will receive a different intervention than 
the one they are randomized to, but if this is the case, a secondary analysis may be performed 
using a per-protocol approach.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
 All adverse events occurring during the study, including those not meeting the criteria of an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) will be recorded.  Records of these events will be maintained and reports submitted to the IRB according to the regulatory requirements.  Expected clinical adverse events and nonsignificant (not serious) clinical adverse events will not be reported. Expected clinical adverse events and anticipated adverse device effects are those listed in Section 1.5.2.

serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 Adverse Effect (Event)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject involved in clinical study of an investigational device; regardless of the causal relationship of the problem with the device or, if applicable, other study related treatment(s).  
 Associated with the investigational device:  There is a reasonable possibility that the 
adverse effect may have been caused by the investigational device. 
 
Life-threatening adverse effect:  Any adverse effect that places the subject, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the effect as it occurred .  It does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  Serious adverse effect:  An adverse effect is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening AE 
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity

Unanticipated adverse effect: Any adverse effect, the nature, specificity, severity, or 
frequency of which is not consistent with the risk information in the clinical study protocol or elsewhere in the current IDE application.  
 General Physical Examination Findings At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization will be documented and reported as an unanticipated adverse device effect unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adve rse event.  
 Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:   
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition.

study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator. 
 Post-study Adverse Event  
Patients will follow up with their surgeon at standard intervals specific to their surgeons’ preference and the patient’s medical condition. If adverse events are identified, patients will be followed by their primary health care team.    Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSO)  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets all of the following three criteria:  
• Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new

• Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" whe n it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND 
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research

9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.

Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term 
survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
9.2 Source Documents  
 
Source data comprise all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, 
recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transc riptions certified after verification 
as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  When applicable, information 
recorded on the CRF shall match the Source Data recorded on the Source Documents.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
A Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed for each subject enrolled into the clinical study.  The investigator-sponsor will review, approve and sign/date each completed CRF; the investigator-sponsor’s signature serving as attestation of the investigator-sponsor’s

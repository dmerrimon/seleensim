1. STUDY DESIGN / SUMMARY :  
 
This will be a single -center prospective randomized control trial that IRB-approved study. We plan to 
enroll 250 female  patients presenting to UAB for stereotactic biopsy.  This study is a prospective will 
target approximately 250 patients. This will be a HIPPA -compliant randomized control trial planned on 
spanning approximately six months’ time. Patients will be entered into the study only based on their 
already scheduled stereotactic biopsy procedure. Patients will be informed of the study and t hey will be 
offered the opportunity to participate or not participate in the study. Their participation is completely 
voluntary. This study will not involve any intervention that is not already a part of standard care. Patients 
will be randomized to two gr oups, one group that will undergo clip placement with approximately with a 5 
mm retraction of the biopsy clip post -placement and one that will involve no retraction prior to 
deployment.  
2. BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALLE  
 
Clip placement after stereotactic biopsy in breast imaging procedures has been an important part of 
breast imaging for years. There have been numerous studies documenting clip migration, and it is now a 
well-known phenomenon.  Numerous case reports describ e varying locations of clips following biopsy, 
some being as much as 5 cm from the biopsy site. This creates a problem in both benign and malignant 
diagnoses. In the setting of a benign biopsy, a clip remains important to provide correlation with a biopsy 
finding and the original suspicious mammographic site. In malignant diagnoses, the implication is more 
significant as the clip provides the localization site for excision. Clip migration has been suspected as the 
cause of up to 60% margin positivity (vs 0%  when localizing the biopsy site by using hematoma 
identification) in breast cancer cases.1 Although there have been recommended methods of deployment, 
vacuuming of cavity, release of compression after biopsy, and first post -biopsy mammography 
positioning techniques, there has been no prospective study assessing technique of clip retraction prior 
to deployment. Our hypothesis is that retracting to clip 5 mm before clip deployment will help to decrease 
clip migration. This will help improved accuracy of biop sy site localization and in cases of malignancy, will 
allow for less complicated, better localized, and improved results of tumor targeting for surgical resection.  
3. OBJECTIVES   
 
3.1 Primary Objective  
 
To determine which method decreases clip migration better, retracting the clip deployment 
apparatus 5 mm before deployment or not retracting.  
 
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
3.2.1  Compare different breast densities (entirely fatty, scattered fibroglandular densities, 
heterogeneously dense, extremely dense) and their impact on cl ip migration  in both 
groups (retracted vs nonretracted).  
 
3.2.2  Compare different approaches (lateral, medial, superior) to biopsy and evaluate if they 
have an impact on clip migration  in both groups (retracted vs nonretracted).  
 
3.2.3  Evaluate if thinner or thicker breasts result in more or less clip migration in both groups 
(retracted vs nonretracted).  
 
3.2.4  Evaluate if patient’s age correlates with more or less clip migration in both groups 
(retracted vs nonretracted).  
 
4. PARTICIPANT SELECTION  
 
     This will be a single -center randomized control prospective  IRB-approved study. We will enroll 250 
female patients  presenting to have stereotactic breast biopsy procedures . We will approach all 
stereotactic biopsy patients (less excluded pa tients), targeting 300 with the goal of 250 by 1 year.  
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
All 18 -99 year -old healthy females with recommendation for stereotactic biopsy.  
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
4.2.1  If there is no clip present on post -clip mammography, the patient will be excluded from the 
trial (even if a clip was replaced).  
4.2.2  If 2 clips were placed (due to one not being seen initially), the patient will be excluded.  
4.2.3  Patients who have undergone reduc tion mammoplasty will also be excluded as this has been 
discussed as a potential reason for clip migration8.  
4.2.4  No pregnant females will be included. There will be no males included.  
4.2.5  There will be no mentally impaired patients included.  
4.2.6  No non-english  speaking patients included in the study.  
4.2.7  There will be no prisoners included in this study.  
4.2.8  Inability to provide written informed consent  
4.2.9  Males will not be included.  
4.3 Inclusion of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. There is no bias towards age 
or race in this trial.  
 
 
5. RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING  
 
5.1 Recruitment Process  
 
Patients will be presenting to the The  Kirklin Clinic at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, 
Fifth floor Mammography for the purpose of previously recommended stereotactic biopsy.  The study 
coordinator , PI, or participating attending radiologist will arrange the interview and provide  all data for 
entry  in a secure web -based research database.  
 
5.2 Screening Process  
 
The study coordinator , PI, or participating attending radiologist will screen  potentially eligible 
patients.  
 
 
6. PROTOCOL PROCEDURES, METHODS, AND DURATION  (LAYMAN’S DESCRIPTION)  
 
After confirmation of patient eligibility, the study coordinator , PI, or participating attending radiologist  
will obtain written informed consent. The informed consent process may take up to 10 minutes . The 
patients will be discharged from the study after data has been recorded .  
 
Standard of Care:  
 
The stereotactic biopsy will proceed as normally scheduled. This procedure involves the patient 
presenting to the fifth floor of The Kirklin Clinic (TKC) at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
Once she checks in, she is escorted to a changing room whe re she changes into a gown. She is then 
has brought back to the biopsy suite by the technologist. The technologist reviews the biopsy 
procedure with the patient. The attending radiologist then is notified and joins the technologist and 
patient in the biops y suite. The radiologist reviews the biopsy with the patient and obtains informed 
consent.  
  
Study protocol:  
 
After informed consent for the procedure, the radiologist will discuss the study with the patient after 
the patient. The patient will have time to ask questions and the radiologist will provide answers. If the 
patient expresses understanding and agrees to participate in the study, consent will be obtained in 
written form on a document separate from her biopsy consent document. This will be placed in a 
secure location and locked in a cabinet in the mammography department on the fifth floor TKC, 
accessible only to the PI.  
 
Standard of Care:  
 
The procedure will take place as normally planned with the patient being positioned in craniocaudal 
(CC), late ral-medial (LM), or medial -lateral (ML) position determined by the radiologist ahead of time. 
The choice of positioning is decided on by the radiologist based on experience and best pathway to 
obtain to target. Images are obtained to verify the target loca tion. The skin is cleaned and skin/breast 
anesthetized. A needle (9 gauge 10 cm Eviva vacuum -assisted needle attached to an ATEC vacuum 
suction machine) is placed to obtain the sample of the biopsy target. The tissue undergoes x -ray 
imaging to ensure adequ ate sampling of tissue. Once sampling is considered appropriate, standard 
steps are performed in the following manner:  
1. After biopsy, the cavity is flushed with sterile saline.  
2. Tubing is disconnected to allow for suction of fluid from the biopsy cavity. Sam ples are retrieved 
from the collection chamber.  
3. ATEC machine is placed on biopsy setting until visualization of x -rayed specimens  
4. When samples are determined to be adequately retrieved, the clip will be placed (the same clip 
will be chosen for all procedur es to improve standardization unless the attending radiologist 
determines another clip would be needed).  
5. Biopsy clip is then advanced to the site.  
At this point, everything performed will is be routine.  
 
Study protocol:  
 
Arm 1: Advancing the clip to the biopsy site and deploying.  
 
Arm 2: Advancing the clip to the biopsy site and retracting 5 mm and then deploying.  
 
Standard protocol  
 
After imaging is obtained to ensure that the clip is visualized, the introducer and clip  are removed 
together.  
 
Patient is then slowly released from mammographic compression maintaining pressure on the breast 
for at least five minutes. Slow release of pressure is performed.  
 
The patient is then informed of post -biopsy changes. Pressure is hel d until hemostasis is achieved 
and a sterile skin glue is applied to the skin incision at the entrance site of the biopsy needle.  
 
A two -view mammogram is performed with the first image obtained in the same position as the 
biopsy is performed.  
 
Clip migrat ion will be measured on the post -biopsy mammogram compared to the pre -biopsy 
mammography exam. Clip migration will be measured by the location of the clip with respect to the 
biopsy site on the immediate post -clip mammography images. While delayed clip mig ration has been 
found in case reports, the number of cases of this phenomenon is not felt to warrant additional 
mammography exams for this study.8 The millimeters of clip migration will be measured on the CC 
view and on the true lateral (ML or LM) views. A lthough migration usually only occurs in one plane, 
both planes will be reviewed and if there is migration in two planes, one component factor 
(Pythagorean Theorem as has been used on prior studies1) will be calculated.  
 
We will consider significant migrat ion is anything greater than 10 mm from the biopsy site. The use of 
10 mm has been documented on prior studies and will be considered as a differentiation point in this 
study between significant and nonsignificant movement. A further reason for the use of the 10 mm 
cut off is that at this institution, Savi Scout devices are commonly used for localization. This device is 
12 mm long and can accurately be placed at a location bridging the biopsy site and biopsy clip. Any 
complications will be reported.  
 
7. RISKS  
 
7.1 Breach of Confidentiality – There is an unlikely  potential risk of a breach of confidentiality.  
 
7.2 Radiation – Study participants will be exposed to radiation from the mammography imaging . 
There is an extremely low risk that the radiation may cause cancer or other radiation effects 
years after the study. Exposure to the radiation through this study is a part of routine 
healthcare.  
 
7.3 Risk of an Unexpected  Imaging Finding – There is a risk that an unexpected  imaging fin ding 
could be detected. In many cases, these are of benefit to the patient, such as detection of a 
unexpected  cancer. In some cases, the unexpected  finding may be indeterminate, such as a 
renal mass that is not clearly benign or malignant. Indeterminate fi ndings may need additional 
workup that will not be covered as a part of this study.  
 
 
8. PRECAUTIONS / MINIMIZATION OF RISKS  
 
Participants will be monitored by study personnel for risks —physical, psychological, social, 
economic, and/or legal —that participants may encounter during their participation in this study 
or as a result of DECT imaging and data collection  required in this  protocol.   
 
8.1 Breach of Confidentiality – The research team is experienced and will utilize best practices to 
avoid a breach of confidentiality.  The risk of confidentially will be minimized by collecting only 
the data that is required by the study, labelin g all data forms and samples with a coded 
identifier, and maintaining all study records in locked files or password -protected computer 
files. 
 
8.2 Radiation – The radiation used in this study is a part of the patient’s standard of care. No 
additional radiation is being used due to the study.  
 
8.3 Risk of an Unexpected  Imaging Finding – All of the research DECT liver CTs will be 
interpreted by a radiologist, a physician with expertise in CT imaging. A formal report will be 
placed permanently in the electronic medical records. Clinically significant unexpected 
imaging findings will be comm unicated by phone with the gastroenterologist, per standard of 
care at UAB.   
 
 
9. BENEFITS  
 
If our  hypothesis is  true that retracting the clip 5 mm before clip deployment will help to decrease clip 
migration , this will help improved accuracy of biopsy site l ocalization and in cases of malignancy, will 
allow for less complicated, better localized, and improved results of tumor targeting for surgical 
resection.  If the hypothesis does not hold true, than this method of clip deployment should no longer 
be used as it does nothing to improve clip migration.  
 
10. ALTERNATIVES  
 
This is not a treatment study. The alternative is to not participate in this study.  
 
 
11. DATA AND IMAGE ANALYSIS  
 
11.1 Image  Evaluation  and Analysis : Clip migration will be measured on the post -
biopsy mammogram compared to the pre -biopsy mammography exam. Clip migration will be 
measured by the location of the clip with respect to the biopsy site on the immediate post -clip 
mammography images. While delayed clip migration has been found in case reports, the 
number of cases of this phenomenon is not felt to warrant additional mammography exams 
for this study.8 The millimeters of clip migration will be measu red on the CC view and on the 
true lateral (ML or LM) views.  Although migration usually only occurs in one plane, both 
planes will be reviewed and if there is migration in two planes, one component factor 
(Pythagorean Theorem as has been used on prior stud ies1) will be calculated.  
 
11.2 We will consider significant migration is anything greater than 10 mm from the 
biopsy site. The use of 10 mm has been documented on prior studies and will be considered 
as a differentiation point in this study between significant  and nonsignificant movement. A 
further reason for the use of the 10 mm cut off is that at this institution, Savi Scout devices are 
commonly used for localization. This device is 12 mm long and can accurately be placed at a 
location bridging the biopsy sit e and biopsy clip. Any complications will be reported.  
 
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATION : 
This is a single -center prospective randomized study  to assess two technique s of clip 
retraction prior to deployment  and to determine which method decreases clip migration better, 
retracting the clip deployment apparatus 5 mm before deployment or not retracting. This will help 
improved accuracy of biopsy site localization and in cases of malignancy, will allow for less 
compli cated, better localized, and improved results of tumor targeting for surgical resection.   
 
12.1 Sample size justification  
 
A total of  250 female patients presenting to UAB for stereotactic biopsy will be randomly 
assigned as 1:1 ratio to Arm1 (n=125) with advancing the clip to the biopsy site and deploying, or 
Arm2 (n=125) with advancing the clip to the biopsy site and retracting 5 mm a nd then deploying .  Our 
hypothesis is that retracting to clip 5 mm before clip deployment will decrease clip migration, e.g. only 
20% or less of breast biopsy  patients  who will have  significant migration (greater than 10 mm from 
the biopsy site ) while advancing the clip to the biopsy site and deploying without  retracting  will have 
at least of 50% significant migration . This size of 125 in each arm will have 99.9% power to test 30% 
difference (20% vs 50%) or >90% power to test at least 20% difference in  proportion of patients who 
will have significant migration  using one -sided Fisher's Exact test at 5% significant level  (Table 1) .

50 15 1 100 
50 20 1 99.6 
50 25 1 95.4 
50 30 1 78.5 
 
A sample size of 125 will also produce  two-sided 95% confidence interval to estimate the mean distance of 
migration with 0.177 standard deviation  to the limits for each arm.  Patients enrollment is expected to be completed 
within one year.  
 
 
13.2 Statistical analysis plan  
 
The primary objective  of the  number and percentage of breast biopsy  patients whose clip has 
greater than 10 mm from the biopsy site as significant clip migration will be estimated and two -sided 
95% confidence interval will be calculated using the method of Clopper –Pearson interval  for each arm 
separately . Fisher exact test will be used to examine if there is significant association  between arms in 
proportion of  significant clip migration. The average of distance of clip migration will be estimated with 
two-sided 95% CI for each arm separately using normal approximation. Two -group student t -test will 
be used to evaluate the mean difference in the distance of migration from the original biopsy site 
between arms.  
Correlation between migration and breast densities (entirely fatty, scattered fibroglandular densities, 
heterogeneously dense, extremely dense), different approaches (lateral, medial, superior) to biopsy, 
if thinner or thicker breasts and age under procedure of retracted (arm2) vs nonretra cted (arm1)  will 
be evaluated in two ways for the secondary objectives. First, we will consider significant clip 
migration (yes, no) as binary outcome . Analysis of  Variance method (ANOVA) will be used to 
compare age differences  with controlling of procedur es, and Cochran  -Mantel -Haenszel Test will be 
used to compare differences in categorical variables, e.g. breast density stratified by retracted (arm2) 
vs nonretracted (arm1).  Logistic  regression analysis will be explored to identify significant factors 
associated with clip migration. Odds ratio and two-sided  95% CI  will be presented for each factor 
significantly contributed in the model.  Second, we will consider distance of clip migration (mm) as 
continuous outcome. ANOVA wi ll be used to evaluate  the strength of association  (beta coefficient in 
the regression  model) and identify significan t of factors associated with the distances  of migration .  
All analysis will be carried out with Statistical  software  SAS v9.4.

SPONSOR:UAB Department of Radiology
General Information You are being asked to take part in a research study. This research 
study is voluntary, meaning you do not have to take part in it. The 
procedures, risks, and benefits are fully described further in the 
consent form.
Purpose The purpose of the study is to see if the technique used to place the 
breast biopsy clip, which is a tiny piece of titanium used to identify the 
site of your biopsy, can reduce the movement of the clip after the 
placement. 
Duration & Visits You will be in this study for one visit. This visit will last up to two 
hours. 
Overview of 
ProceduresThis study will include the standard of care breast biopsy. You will be 
randomized (like a flip of a coin) to one of two groups. In one group, a 
clip deployment device will be inserted and clip placed. In the second 
group, 5 mm of withdrawn of the device will be performed prior to 
clip deployment. Both techniques are currently used by physicians. 
We will not know prior to you consenting to participate which group 
you will be assigned.
Risks The most common risks include bruising and swelling in the breast, 
infection or bleeding at the biopsy site. The clip may or may not be 
placed correctly at the biopsy site regardless of the technique. 
Benefits You may or may not benefit from this study, but the information may 
be useful is helping improve breast biopsies in the future.
Alternatives If you do not want to take part in the study, you will continue your 
treatment and imaging ordered by your doctor without any 
consequence.
Purpose of the Research
We are asking you to take part in a research study. The purpose of this study is to compare two 
techniques used to place a clip during a breast biopsy procedure. We are comparing if the 
technique used to place the breast biopsy clip could reduce the movement of the clip.
This study will recruit 251 patients from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Version Date:  2/11/2022Explanation of Procedures
You have been referred to diagnostic mammography to have a procedure called a breast 
biopsy. You will be seen by a Breast Radiologist as a part of your routine clinical care.
There will be no special test or scans related to this study. You will receive standard of care 
treatment. By deciding to participate in this study, you are giving permission for the Principal 
Investigator and staff to review your medical records.
If you take part in this study, you will be assigned to one of two groups:
the clip is placed by inserting the clip-placing instrument into the site of the biopsy then 
withdrawing it by 5 mm where the clip is placed.the clip is placed by inserting the clip-placing 
instrument into the site of the biopsy where the clip is placed without withdrawing the 
instrument.
You will be randomized (like a flip of a coin) to one of the groups. Both techniques are currently 
used by physicians. We will not know prior to you consenting to participate which group you 
will be assigned.
The breast biopsy procedure you will be undergoing is the standard of care stereotactic 
(mammographic-guided) breast biopsy. It will involve cleaning the skin and making the area 
numb by injecting numbing medicine with a small needle. The area of concern in your breast 
will be identified and a needle will be placed into the breast to obtain a small sample of breast 
tissue. After we complete the biopsy, the clip will be placed using one of the two techniques 
described above. Biopsy clip placement is standard of care for all breast biopsies. There are 
different ways to place the clip and we will be using one of two ways to place the clip in your 
breast. Both methods are used by many different doctors. At the end of the procedure, we 
perform a post-biopsy (two-view) mammogram, which is also standard of care for every biopsy.
Your participation in this study will only be one visit. The visit will be your standard of care 
breast biopsy at The Kirklin Clinic (TKC). When you arrive at the TKC the research staff will be 
available to answer any questions regarding the procedure and consent form. This will take 
approximately 30 minutes. After you have signed the consent the breast biopsy will take up to 
one hour.
Risks and Discomforts
If you decide to participate, you will be assigned to a treatment arm (retracting the clip and not 
retracting) by chance, like the flip of a coin. The treatment you are assigned may prove to be
less effective or have more side effects than the other study group or alternatives; however, 
both treatment arms are routinely used in patient care.  Regardless, the general risks of breast 
biopsies include: bruising and swelling in the breast, infection or bleeding at the biopsy site. The 
clip may or may not be placed correctly at the biopsy site regardless of the technique. As far as 
anyone knows, these risks are equivalent for both techniques.
Benefits
You may or may not benefit directly from taking part in this study. However, this study may 
help us better understand how to improve breast biopsies in the future. This may also 
ultimately improve the outcomes for patients with breast cancer.

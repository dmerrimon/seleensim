1.0 INTRODUCTION 
This document is a protocol for a hum an research study. This study is to 
be conducted according to US and inter national standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and Inte rnational Conference on Harmonization 
guidelines), applicable gover nment regulations and Instit utional research policies 
and procedures. 
1.1 Specific Aims and Hypothesis 
We hypothesize that targeting VPAC1 receptors overexpressed on PC cell 
surfaces with a Cu-64 imaging agent, TP3805 will provide a specific and 
sensitive means for molecular diagnosis of PC at an early stage, to determine its 
recurrence, and to image metastases. 
Our specific aim is to assess the ability of Cu-64-TP3805 to detect PC 
within the prostate gland. 
1.2 Background and Rationale 
Cancer is complex yet commonplace, and the most terrifying disease of 
mankind. Among men in the USA, PC is particularly lethal, second only to 
cancers of the lung and bronchus combi ned [1]. In 2010, more than 30,000 men 
succumbed to PC and more than 240,000 new PC cases were identified in the 
USA [1]. PC affects one in every 6 m en who are 60 years or older and affects 
African-Americans at a rate 2.4 time s greater than European-Americans [1]. 
Great strides have been made both in di agnosis and treatment of PC. However, 
the PC-related death rate has not yet decli ned, and the quality of life of survivors 
has not yet improved [1]. Three prominen t screening tests, the digital rectal 
examination, MRI, and a blood test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) 
determination play a significant role in detecting pathologically advanced PC. 
However, they are not considered reliable t ools for early warning of PC [2], [3], 
[4] nor can they be used reliably to detect recurrent cancer or to determine 
  
  
 
 8 metastatic status of the disease. T he lack of reliable di agnosis, results in 
undertreatment or overtreat ment of patients with minimal benefit, enormous 
morbidity, incontinence, and/or impotence. T herefore, histology remains the 
mainstay of PC confirmation. However, out of >750,000 biops ies performed each 
year in the USA, >65% show benign pat hology, and cost hundreds of millions of 
health care dollars. Various imaging te chniques have been evaluated, but their 
utility to image suspected PC or its metast atic lesions is not fully dependable [3]. 
Furthermore, monitoring the effectivenes s of PC therapy continues to be a 
challenge. 
Our proposed approach to image PC, it s metastases, and recurrence is 
driven by targeting an endogenous genetic  product overexpressed when cells 
suffer genetic damage that ignites cancerous transformation. These characteristic fingerprints, the VPAC1 cell surface receptors, express themselves 
at the onset of the malignancy, and may be prior to elevation of PSA, and well 
before cell morphology is altered [5]. Thus VPAC1 receptors provide a specific 
target that has not ye t been exploited for imaging suspected PC and its 
metastases [5]. VPAC1 mediates VIP (vas oactive intestinal peptide) and PACAP 
(pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide) growth hormone function in all types of PC [6-8]. During the past 10 year s we have successfully initiated the use 
of Cu-64 labeled VPAC1 receptor-specific  peptide constructs to image disease 
specific oncogene products in experim ental animal model s of pancreatic, 
prostate and breast cancer (BC) , and in humans with BC [9-13]. 
We hypothesize that targeting VPAC1 receptors overexpressed on PC cell 
surfaces [6-8] with a pair of Cu-64 im aging agents, TP3939 (a  VIP analog) or 
TP3805 (a PACAP analog), will provide a specific and sensitive means for 
molecular diagnosis of PC at an early stage, to dete rmine its recurrence, and to 
image metastases. This molecular approach for diagnosis is both novel and feasible for deployment in the clinic. Furt hermore, it promises to reduce the need 
for invasive biopsies, and meet the co mpelling need to reduce overtreatment, 
and surgery yielding minimal benefit, inc ontinence, or impot ence. Importantly, 
PET imaging costs much less than biopsy combined with histology [14-16]. 
The need for developing oncogene receptor  specific agents, such as 
those proposed here, is compelling. T he primary tools for PC screening, the 
serum PSA and the digital rectal examinati on are neither specific nor sensitive, 
as many men with elevated PSA have been found not to have PC [2]. Transrectal 
ultrasonography (TRUS) provides an axia l and sagital examination of the 
prostate gland, and allows physicians to estimate its volume. However, in 60-
70% of PC cases are hypoechoic and thus invisible by TRUS [3]. Histologic examination, ther efore, remains the gold standard for PC but requires an 
invasive procedure for tissue sampling. By this time, the PC is usually advanced. 
However, the question still remains as to where to direct the needle for biopsy. As a result, out of the approximately 750,000 prostate biopsies that will be 
performed in the USA in 2010, more t han 2/3 will find beni gn pathology [17]. 
  
  
 
 9 The use of contrast enhanced spiral computerized x-ray tomography (CT) 
is limited to advanced, high-grade tumors  [18]. Using 3D MR spectroscopic 
imaging, PC was diagnosed as possible if th e ratio of choline to  citrate exceeded 
2SD above the normal population and definit e if the ratio exceeded 3SD above 
the normal population [19]. However, sens itivity and specificity were only 80% 
and 46%, respectively [20]. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is known to be a powerful tool for localiz ation of vascular solid tumors [21]. 
DCE-MRI however has low sensitivity (50% ) [22] and has not been able to  
distinguish between PC and benign pr ostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [23]. T2 
weighted endorectal MRI also has low accu racy of PC detection [24]. Much more 
work therefore, is needed to be done [25]. 
Agents for scintigraphic molecular imaging of PC are F-18-FDG, In-111-
ProstaScint [26], C-11-choline, C- 11-acetate [18], F-18-FLT (F-18-
Fluorothymidine) and F-18-Fluorocholine.  Cu-64 Bombesin [27], 2-F-18 
fluoropropianic acid [28] and those target  PSMA [18]. Althoug h C-11-acetate and 
C-11-choline may have improved scint igraphic advantage over F-18-FDG 
imaging, their efficacy in use centers is lacking. The F-18-FDG uptake is high in 
bladder, low in PC and overlaps with upt ake in the normal gland, postoperative 
scar or local recurrence. These complicat e the visualization for PC imaging even 
further [29]. Similarly the low tumor/bl ood ratios and high bladder uptake, of 2-F-
18-fluoropropianic acid, may question its utility in humans [28]. In-111-
ProstaScint or Tc-99m and PSMA antib ody have not been considered to be a 
useful agent [18]. Despite these weaknesses, there ha ve been 195 investigations 
in which F-18-FDG was employed and additi onal 109 in which In-111-ProstaScint 
was utilized (PubMed, 2012). Generally , these agents were used for imaging 
primary and recurrent disease, metastatic  disease and to determine the influence 
of therapy of the PC. In  none of the cases did the agents work with reliability, 
high sensitivity, or specif icity. These investigations demonstrate a compelling 
need for imaging agent that can help physi cians in the managem ent of desperate 
PC patients. Genetic imaging can pr ovide unique opportuniti es not only for 
imaging PC in suspected PC patients, but also for evaluating treatment response 
[13, 30]. 
With Cu-64-Bombesin tumor uptake wa s only 1.32±0.49% ID/g at 4 hr and 
0.28±0.21% ID/g at 24 hrs, which is signif icantly lower than the 7.5±3.6% ID/g at 
4 hr uptake with one of our Cu-64 l abeled VPAC1 specific peptide analogues, 
TP3939, that did not signific antly decline as a function of  time [27, 30]. We used 
the same animal model and the same cell line as those in the Cu-64 Bombesin 
protocol. Additionally, the steady upt ake of Cu-64-TP-3939 makes sense as 
more of the probe continued to bind to  the VPAC receptor s (see later). In 
contrast, the declining and low uptake of Cu-64-Bombesin uptake was puzzling. 
Ionic Cu-64-Cl
2 has been shown to be taken up by PC (3.0±0.7% ID/g) 
[31], via human copper transpor t 1 protein (hCtr1). As can be seen in Table-2, 
the tumor uptake of Cu- 64-TP3939 in the same PC -3 human PC tumors, in 
athymic nude mice, was 7.48± 3.63 %ID/g. The Cu-64-Cl 2 tumor uptake in the 
  
  
 
 10 same model in our laboratory was 4.79 ±0.34 %ID/g, consistent with data 
reported by the investigators referenc ed above. Assuming that the hCtr1 gene 
will carry Cu-64-Cl 2 to MCF-7 human BC, which ov erexpresses VPAC1 receptors 
in nude mice, we repeated the study in MCF-7 model and found that the tumor 
uptake was <2% ID/g. This suggest ed that the uptake of Cu-64-Cl 2 may be 
dependent upon the tumor vascular ity. In order to further  elucidate the nature of 
Cu-64-Cl 2 tumor uptake, we performed cell binding assays using ionic Cu-64-Cl 2 
with PC-3 cells. The data were analyzed as per  Scatchard, strongly indicate that 
the binding was not related to any specific mechanism (Preliminary Results). These findings suggest that Cu-64-Cl
2 for PC imaging cannot 
be reliable. The need for better agents still persists. 
Rapidly evolving 
advances in genomics and proteomics shed new light on the genesis of many diseases every day and provide us with new approaches in molecular imaging, to diagnose and treat them. Fig. 1 is the schematic presentation that illustrates cell signaling pathways that overexpress specific fingerprints at t he onset of a malignant diseas e within the cell nucleus or 
cytoplasm and on the cell surface. Little or no attempts have yet been made to 
utilize these databases to image PC. In this investigation, we chose to target the 
well characterized, overexpressed VPAC1 surface receptor in human PC. 
Our early data in xenografts, trans genic mice that spontaneously grow PC, 
and mimic pathogenesis of human PC are promising, and so  are the early results 
in PET imaging of human BC in which we have also targeted VPAC1 receptors in nineteen patients. 
Background 
VPAC1 and VPAC2 Overexpression: 
Reubi and colleagues [6-8] exami ned more than 600 tumors and their 
metastases using histochemistry and conclusively reported that VPAC1 and 
VPAC2 receptors are over expressed on a variety of frequently occurring human 
tumors including those of the breast, pr ostate. On 100% of the human prostate 
tumors examined (n=35), VPAC1 receptor s were predominantly overexpressed 
Fig. 1. VPAC1 receptor activates prostate cancer cell proliferation
  
  
 
 11 on PC tissues and VPAC2 on stroma, to a lesser extent. Although VPAC1 
receptors exist on normal cells, their expression is lower on normal than on malignant cells [32, 33] on which the receptor density is high (10
4/cell) [34, 35]. A 
28 amino acid peptide VIP has high affini ty for VIP recept ors and the 27 amino 
acid peptide PACAP have high affinity for VIP and PACAP1 combined oncogene 
receptors expressed on malignant cell surfac e. Therefore, we hypothesize that 
radiolabeled VIP and PACAP1 or their analogues will provide us with excellent 
compounds for accurate and sensitive detection of human PC, once PC is 
suspected. The probe can also detect me tastases, and determine therapeutic 
effectiveness. This will bridge the large void that exists today. 
Why Investigate VPAC1 Biomar ker? Why Cu-64?  And Why PET? 
The implications of diagnosis 
by receptor-specific imaging in the management of PC, and cancer in general, cannot be overemphasized [5]. If successful, the VPAC1-targeted 
peptides are will provide a specific 
and sensitive means for a true, early diagnosis in all patients suspected of having PC, and a guide to the most appropriate therapy. It can detect metastatic lesions and distinguish PC from benign masses. We have targeted VPAC1 receptors which are expressed also on human (BC). and 
have achieved success in PET imaging of BC in nineteen humans (Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b). Our studies in a transgenic (MMTVneu) mouse model that spontaneously grow BC, and overexpress VPAC1 receptors, demonstrated that Cu-64-TP3805 correctly imaged all eight unknown BC and its metastases. All eight tumors expressed VPAC1 receptors (RTPCR).  Cu-64-TP3805 did not image two benign 

  
  
 
 12 lesions which did not express VPA C1 receptors and demonstrated superb 
specificity [36]. Our Preliminary result s in imaging PC also show reasonable, 
hypothesis-driven, success both in experimental human PC grown in 
immunocompramised mice as well as spon taneously arising PC in TRAMP mice. 
VPAC1 surface biomarkers are a st raightforward target [27, 37]. 
These data attest three important parameters as they pertain to this 
proposal: i) That the BC imaging data gener ated in mice by targeting VPAC1 are 
reliable and provide a firm foundation for translation into humans to image BC. ii) 
The PI and his team have the appropriate  expertise and ability to drive basic 
research into clinical applications and iii) These data strongly support our 
hypothesis that the proposed in vestigation will enable us to initiate studies in 
patients suspected to have PC  or are suffering from PC. BC PET imaging either 
with F-18 VIP analogues or Tc-99m-VIP analogues was less successful than that 
with Cu-64 VIP/PACAP analogu es [37-39]. Copper chemistry is well known and 
Cu-64 (t ½ 12.8 hr) half-life is long enough  to obtain commercially and use in 
humans conveniently. Position em ission from Cu-64 is 19%. 
The relatively low (4-6 mm) spatial resolution of current human PET  
scanners may be a problem. However, our  tumor uptake/g with 4±10% mCi Cu-
64/injection will be 240 μCi (6% ID/g) for ~7 μCi in 20 mg, a 1.7 mm diameter 
tumor. This amount of radioactivity will be large enough for unequivocal delineation. We further anticipate t hat the continuous reassessment and 
refinement in PET technique will also add to its improved resolution in years to 
come [40, 41]. The Cu-64 PET images with Cu-64 TP3805 promise early,  accurate, and specific BC images, as we have seen in humans (Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b) 
by targeting VPAC1 receptors with SU V of 9-11. Cu-64-TP3805 unequivocally 
detected twenty out of twent y malignant lesions in nineteen patients we have 
studied so far. Additionally, four involv ed lymph nodes were also delineated. 
(Please see attached manuscript (J Nucl  Med, 54, No. 7, 2013). Because the 
prostate is anatomically dist ant from the liver, we expect  that PC lesions will be 
distinct despite the relatively high liver  uptake. Furthermore the lack of bladder 
uptake facilitates PC delineation (please s ee later, Fig. 9). We further anticipate 
that metastatic bone lesions in PC pati ents will also be readily discerned by PET 
imaging. 
Innovation: 
We have designed, synthesized and c haracterized specific probes to 
target VPAC1, labeled them with Tc -99m for SPECT and with Cu-64 for PET 
imaging of BC and PC (Preliminary Resu lts, below). This molecular approach 
targets a specific biomarker, discover ed through modern advances in genomics 
and proteomics. Their translation to PC  patients is a natural and timely 
progression into a new clinical capability.  Our earlier results, including human BC 
imaging, are highly encouraging [9, 38]. Thes e results lead us to hypothesize that 
one or more of the VPAC1-specific pepti des will provide us with a tool for 
sensitive and specific PET imaging of suspected primary and metastatic PC 
  
  
 
 13 lesions. We expect that VPAC1 receptor  specificity will differentiate malignant 
lesions from benign masses noninvasively,  Unequivocal identification of PC 
lesions could help physicians tailor an appropriate therapeutic intervention. The 
anticipated reduction in false positives and false negatives should reduce 
morbidity and mortality, and improve the qualit y of life of PC patie nts.  This novel 
approach to image PC by targeting a gen e product is hypothesis-driven and 
based upon our own experience and the weal th of information yielded by recent 
advances in genomics and proteomics. W hen prostate cells undergo genomic 
modulations for whatever reason, they overexpress VPAC1 cell surface 
receptors. These changes occur well ahead of shed PSA or cell-morphologic 
alterations, the histology of which forms the basis of current PC diagnosis. The 
specificity of genomic biomarkers, shoul d permit us to image PC in patients. 
Biological fluids, including urine, represent  a promising source of biomarkers for 
detection and prediction of PC prognosis.  Because urine is available non-
invasively and readily, numerous studi es targeting DNA, RNA, protein and 
metabolite based biomarkers have been per formed.  However, none have yet 
reached the clinic].  Even FDA approved PCA3 test has low sensitivity and 
limitations in predicting aggressive PC . 
VPAC1 cell surface genomic receptors ar e over-expressed at the onset of the 
malignancy, prior to elevation of PSA, and well before cell morphology is altered . 
We hypothesized that VPAC1 receptors expressed in high density on PC can be 
targeted for detection of shed tumor cells (S TC) in patient urine, using TP4303, a 
VPAC1 specific biomolecule label ed with a near infrared fluorophore. 
    The success of these goals will meet  the compelling need to a) localize 
primary PC, that can guide biopsy procedures . b) detect recurrent  disease and c) 
image metastatic lesions with improved re liability. Reliable detection of PC can 
reduce the need for invasive biopsies, and minimize overtreatment, including 
surgery. It is important to  note that overtr eatment can cause incontinence or 
impotence. Thus, VPAC1 imaging addresses serious healthcare issues that 
current approaches cannot resolve, despite  the great strides made in recent 
decades. 
The results of our previous translati onal research and early applications in 
imaging BC in humans 
are published [11, 13, 
42, 43] [35-38, 44] [36]. Our studies in a transgenic (MMTV-neu) mouse model that spontaneously grow BC, and overexpress VPAC1 receptors demonstrate that Cu-64-TP3805 correctly imaged all

PUV/BGV ratios for the lesion (IDC, ER+, PR+, HER
2-) were 2.9 for F-18-FDG and 2.2 (lowest of
the series) for Cu-64-TP3805.

1.3 Study Therapy 
This is a diagnostic product developed by  the PI to specifically target 
genomic biomarker VPAC1 that is expr essed on breast and PC cells in high 
density.  With FDA approved eIND (101550) and all institutional approvals, the PI 
has used this radiopharmaceutical Cu -64-TP3805 in nineteen human subjects 
with BC.  The sensitivity of  this agent to image BC le sions and sentinel nodes 
was 100%. 
This project for imaging PC will use the same agent, Cu-64-TP3805 for 
which the approval by FDA is obtained. 
1.4 Preclinical Data 
1.4.1 Vasoactive Intestinal Pe ptide (VIP) and its Analogues: 
VPAC1 receptors are overexpressed on all PC, including metastatic 
lesions (Fig. 3) [6, 8, 45]. High expression of VPAC1 receptors (>104/cell) has 
been observed by others [34, 35, 39]. Both VIP28 and PACAP27 have high affinity for VPAC (VPAC1 and VPAC2) receptors. VIP is a 28-amino acid peptide (Fig.4) initially isolated from porcine intestine [46]. VIP, whose structure is common in humans, pigs and rats, is a hydrophobic, basic peptide containing three lysine [18, 24, 25] and two arginine 
[17, 45] residues. From the essential histidine residue at the N-terminus to the amidated C-terminus, all 28 amino acids of VIP are required for high affinity binding and biological activity [47]. 
VIP gene receptors (VIP1 and 
VIP2) have been detected on the cell membrane of normal intestinal [48] and bronchial epithelial ce lls [48, 49] and are 
overexpressed on various cancer cells, including colonic adenocarcinoma [50-53], pancreatic carcinoma [53] and cancers of the prostate [6, 8, 45]. VIP (Tyr10 and Tyr22) labeled with I-123 successfully imaged a number of human 
  
  
 
 15 
Table 1 :  Amino acid sequence of TP3805 and TP3939tumors [32]. Following PACAP homology, these gene receptors are recently 
named VPAC1 (for VIP1 and PACAP2 co mbined) and VPAC2 (for VIP2 and 
PACAP3 combined).   
VPAC1 receptors are internalized a fter binding to VIP28 [39]. Imaging 
results of F-18-VIP hav e not been encouraging [35, 39]. Because VPAC1 
receptor density is greater in malignant tissue than in benign tissue, tumors can 
be imaged with greater contrast relati ve to normal tissue [7, 39, 54]. 
Two analogues of VIP28 with severa l-fold greater potency have been 
identified [55]. We have developed methods to include chelators (Fig.4) to bind a 
single Tc-99m and Cu-64 cation without co mpromising VIP biological activity. 
Each PC cell has ~104 receptors and each cm3 tumor includes ~109 cells, 
amounting ~1013 receptor s/cm3 tumor. Assuming, cons ervatively, that only 5% 
of these receptors were occupied with Cu-64-VIP, eac h cm3 tumor would contain 
5x1011 molecules of Cu -64-VIP, i.e., 200 μCi of Cu- 64. With high target to 
background ratios, a lesion containing 10 μCi Cu-64 can be unequivocally 
delineated by a human PET scanner. The tumor uptake with our Cu-64-TP3939 
7.5% ID/g [30]. For a human dose  of one mCi, one calculates 75 μCi Cu-64/g 
tumors. Up to 25 mCi Cu-64 probe (A TSM) has been administered to humans 
[56]. A tumor weighing <20 mg (1 .7 mm diameter) can contain 4-5 μCi and be 
easily detectable particularly when the bladder and the normal stromal activity 
are negligible and when tumor/normal prosta te radioactivity ratios averaged 
nearly 4 at 4 hr post injection and 2.7 at  24 hr post injection [30]. Theoretically, 
this should be not only a specific, but also a sensitive technique to detect a 
relatively small number of  malignant cells that cannot  be detected non-invasively 
by any other technique available today. These facts support our  hypothesis that 
Cu-64-VIP analogues may serve as useful  PET molecular probes to detect 
VPAC1 expression for early imaging of PC , its recurrence, metastatic lesions, 
and in long-term should also help physicians to determine effectiveness of therapy. 
The fact that PACAP27 recognizes and ha s high affinity (kd=1.5 nM) for 
both VIP1 and PACAP (VPAC1) receptors that are overexpressed on PC cells 
suggests that PACAP may also be a suitable agent to image PC [8, 57-67]. 
Our data show that these Cu-64 probes are highly stable in vivo [30] [38]. 
Furthermore, the high VIP affinity fo r receptors on malignant cells and 
subsequent internalization [ 10, 11, 13, 30, 37, 43] [38]  minimizes its proteolysis 
and allows cell detection, as we have demonstrated in both mice and humans [30, 36, 37]. We synthesized one analogue of VIP28 (TP3939) and one of PACAP27 (TP3805) that are more potent and biologically stable than VIP28. Their amino acid sequences are given in Table-1. These analogues have the high IC50 values (4.4 nM and 5.3 
  
  
 
 16 nM, respectively) among the many that  have been synthesized and evaluated 
[55, 67]. 
The rationale for choosing TP3939 VIP analogues was as follows. VIP28 
is comprised of three aromatic moieties  at Phe6, Tyr10, and Tyr22, a negatively 
charged site at Asp3 and a lone pair structur e at His1. Although all five sites are 
required for complete binding to receptor s with high affinity, substitutions at 
position 22 of 3-OCH3-4-OH-Phe and Lys 12, Nle17, Val26, Thr28-VIP produced 
the best results, increasing potency by 4 times (IC50 = 4.4 nM vs. 15 nM) over 
VIP28 [55](52). Higher affinity may enhance tumor uptake and improve image 
quality. Again, our recent  preliminary data in humans , obtained using Tc-99m-
TP3654, a VIP analogue are consistent  with this hypothesis [43, 68]. 
PACAP, a 38-amino acid peptide, isol ated from bovine hypothalamus [69], 
was named PACAP because it stimulated the accumulation of intracellular and 
extracellular cAMP in monolayer cultures  of rat anterior pi tuitary cells [70]. 
PACAP, a neurotransmitter and member of  the VIP family, is 10 times more 
potent than VIP in stimulati ng adenylate cyclase in pi tuitary cells [70]. PACAP 
has three gene receptors, PACAP1, 2, and 3.  Gottschall et al [69] isolated 27-
amino acid PACAP (PACAP27) from bov ine hypothalamus and concluded that 
PACAP38 and PACAP27 were equally active and derived from a single 176-
amino acid precursor. PACAP27, like VIP, has an amidated C-terminus and 
histidine at the N-termi nus. Nineteen of the 27 ami no acids of PACAP27 are 
identical to VIP. It is for these r easons we chose to investigate a PACAP 
analogue TP3805 which also has higher IC50 value than VIP28. 
1.4.2 Synthesis and Biological Eval uation of VIP and PACAP Analogues: 
Synthesis of N2(S-benzyl)2 Containing VIP: 
Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) bound to a C-terminal diaminodithiol 
(N2S2) chelator was synthesized on a Wang resin using an ABI 341A peptide 
synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) [ 37] [30, 38]. The analogues were  
prepared, purified and char acterized by American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, 
CA) and named after their molecular weights as TP3805 and TP3939. A 
schematic presentation of TP3939 is given in Fig. 4.  Although peptides have 
been conjugated with chelating agents such as DOTA (1, 4, 7, 10-
tetraazadocdecane –N, N”, N’”, N””, -tetra acetic acid) it requires a prepared and 
pre-purified peptide to which DOTA is to be conjugated. The conjugated product 
then needs further purificati on and characterization. Pr eparation of our analogues 
is a one step process that provides effi ciency, saves time and provides a N2S2 
type of chelating moiety for strong  chelation with Cu -64 or Tc-99m. 
1.4.3 Preclinical Animal Studies: 
Preclinical animal studies included i) TP3805 functional studies to assess 
its biochemical characteristics, ii) cell binding studies to examine its receptor 
specificity and (Kd) binding affinity, iii) re ceptor blocking studies to confirm its 
  
  
 
 17 receptor specificity, iv) tissue distribut ion studies in athymic nude mice bearing 
human PC tumors, v) imaging (PET/CT) spontaneously grown PC  in transgenic 
TRAMP mice and vi) in vivo stability ( 30, 37, 38).  As per the suggestion by 
CCRRC reviewers, the details  of these data are eliminated from this revised 
application. 
1.5 Toxicity Studies: 
We plan to inject no more than 20 μg of a peptide to a standard 70 kg 
patient.  We planned to inject i.v. to a group of three adult female rabbits, each 
10 times, 50 times, and 100 times excess dose, adjusted to body weight (i.e. 
2.86 μg/kg, 14.3 μg/kg, or 28.6 μg/kg).  Preparations we re made using decayed 
Cu-64 solution, as described previously.  We initiated our work with three adult 
female, white New Zealand rabbits (age > 15 wks, body weight > 3 kg).  The 
fourth rabbit served as a control.  On day-1 of the experiment, each rabbit was 
weighed in a calibrated, el ectronic scale by placing a rabbit in a plastic box, 
which was placed on the scale and its weight  tared.  Animal body weights were 
read and recorded on an individual chart.  All rabbit work described below was 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out 
with assistance from a trained technologis t from the institut ional laboratory 
animal services department.  A staff veterina rian was available for consultation.    
The animals (named A, B, and C) were  then placed in a rabbit restraint 
box and two arterial blood samples, 3 mL each, were obtained from ear artery of 
each rabbit.  One anti-coagulated sample was then given to the institutional 
hematology laboratory.  The other was centrifuged and serum was collected.  
Part of the serum was retained in our laboratory for cAMP (cyclic Adenosine 
MonoPhosphate) assay, and t he other portion was provi ded to the institutional 
clinical laboratory for determination of  comprehensive metabolic panel.  This 
procedure was followed on each rabbit.  Each rabbit was then given 28.6 μg x 
body weight of pepti de preparation in 500 μL 0.8% NaCl through a lateral ear 
vein and the syringe wa s flushed with another 500 μL of 0.9% NaCl.  Animals 
were watched for any reaction for 10 minut es and another pair of 3 mL arterial 
blood samples was obtained through ear ar tery.  Each rabbit was then watched 
twice daily, and on day 5, 10, and 17 they were weighed, weight recorded, and 
two venous blood samples from each  rabbit were obtained for cAMP 
measurements and for blood and serum c hemistry as described above.  After 
drawing blood sample, on day 17, animals were sacrificed and samples of liver, 
spleen, kidney, lungs, and heart were remov ed.  The tissues were then placed in 
10% formalin; the tissues (5 x 3 treated ra bbits plus 5 from a normal, untreated 
rabbit) were given to institutional hist ology research laboratory to obtain 5 μ thick, 
H+E stained histology slides.  These sl ides were then examined by Dr. Peter 
McCue, Professor of Pathol ogy at our (TJU) hospital. 
cAMP assays were performed in trip licate on a total of 15 blood samples 
from the three experimental rabbits, along with the standar ds provided with a 
cAMP direct immunoassay kit obtained from  Biovision (Mountain View, CA).  A 
calibration curve was prepared and assays were performed in triplicate.  Optical 
  
  
 
 18 density was measured at 450 nm.  The readings were averaged for each serum 
sample and percent change in cAMP with respect to the sample obtained before 
peptide administration were  calculated and tabulated. 
1.5.1. Results of toxicology studies 
i) Comprehensive metabolic panel  
Results are tabulated in Table-2, in  parts I and II.  For all electrolytes, 
enzymes and protein measurem ents, each rabbit sample prior to injecting the 
peptide served as its own control.  Resu lts are presented as % difference for 
each rabbit at each time point and then as % average of the difference.  The % 
difference averaged out < 25% except for bilirubin, which averaged 100%.  We 
believe this is within the normal fluct uation range of 0.1 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL.

Compl
ete blood count and differential 
Complete blood and blood differential anal ysis was performed on each rabbit 
blood sample obtained prior to peptide in jection (control) and then at 10 min, 5d, 
10d, and 17d post injection.  Data are summa rized in Table-3, parts I and II.  The 
data are presented as % difference with respect to the control sample for the hematological parameters in each blood sample obtained after administration of 
the diagnostic agent.  In none of the data points (except last reading for WBC in 
animal A) was the difference greater than 6% (well below  10%).  These data too 
are consistent with the lack of ev idence that the agent had induced any 
pharmacologic effect.

ii) Body Weight 
The animal body weights are summarized in Table-4.  No animal suffered 
any body weight loss, suggesting that the peptide administration induced no 
adverse events leading to reduced dietary intake, altering animal body chemistry, 
or physiology that would adversely influe nce body weight.  In fact, there was only 
an increase in the body weight, which is an expected normal phenomenon indicating normal health in all three animals.

The data on determination of serum cAMP (pmol/mL) in all three rabbits 
are given in Table-5.  Data strongly show  that in none of the rabbits, at any time 
during the 17 day experimental period, wa s there any statisti cally significant 
change (p = 0.34 or greater) in cAMP.  The normal serum cAMP range in rabbits 
is 12.76-20.93 pmol/mL.  The cAMP values  in rabbits B and C were well within 
this range.  In rabbit A however, the c ontrol serum cAMP value was 21.095.  At 
the 10 min time point, this value was 21.78 and at day 10 it was 22.22.  These values are not statistically, significantly different within themse lves.  These data 
too indicate that the cAMP levels were not altered by  the administration of the 
peptide.

iv) Histology 
The animal histology data are presented in Table-6 (signed by Dr. McCue, 
Professor of Pathology) and in  Fig. 5 as stated by Prof essor McCue, no specific 
pathologic changes in organs examined were induced at any time in any of the 
animals.

a Normal and Treated Rabbits (400x)

(Table 6)
  
  
 
 24 v) Conclusion 
These data in all three rabbits for 17 days after the administration of the 
highest (x100) peptide concentration dose di d not show any pharmacologic effect 
in any parameter studied.  We therefore concluded t hat the studies in lower 
concentration (x10 and x50) doses w ould be unnecessary, and we could not 
justify sacrificing so many otherwise normal rabbits. 
1.6 Radiation Dosime tric Calculations 
The mouse tissue distribution data obt ained at 4hr and 24hr post injection 
was converted into % ID/organ and normali zed for a kg body weight.  All organs 
were weighed and average weight was used.   Blood weight was estimated at 7% 
of the body weight, intestine at 40% body  weight (32) and mu scle at 9.3% body 
weight (33).  Dosimetric calculations  were performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 
program obtained from Vander bilt University.  Data, the effective dose 
equivalent, is presented in Table-7 in mSv/mBq and rem/mCi. 
Table-7:  Estimated Absorbed Radiation Dose for Cu-64-Peptide 
 
 
                

  
  
 
 25 For whole body imaging, (G roup-A, please see sectio n 1) we shall enroll 6 
patients. In order to determine optimal image quality, we sha ll inject 2 patients 
with 3 mCi (±10%), 2 pati ents with 3.5 mCi (±10%) and 2 with 4 mCi (±10%). 
Image quality will be determined by a physician. Imaging time shall be 
approximately 45 mins. 
Patients in group B wil l undergo PEM imaging using only the dose as 
determined from above. Howe ver, this dose shall not be more than 4±10% mCi. 
It is estimated that the dose received by kidneys, (total) blood, gall bladder wall, 
lungs, pancreas, uterus, and osteogenic ce lls will be high among all organs.  
However, the overall abs orbed radiation dose is le ss than that from the 
commonly used diagnostic dose of 5- 10 mCi of Ga-67 (Table-8) (34). 
Table-8:  Radiation Dosimetry for Ga-67 

  
  
 
 26 Please note that we expect the lung absorbed dose to be much smaller.  
This is because the mice lungs from which this human absorbed dose was derived had micrometastases in their l ungs, secondary to the primary breast 
cancer.  In normal lung mice, the uptake is only 25% of that seen here.  Therefore, in the studies with human lungs, free of canc er or cancer metastases, 
we anticipate much less absorbed r adiation dose than presented here. 
1.7 Chemistry preparations and controls (CMC) 
1.7.1 Preparation 
The preparation will consist of 20 μg of the peptide in 4 μL of sterile 0.1M 
acetate buffer pH = 4.6, to which will be added 400 μL of 0.2 M glycine buffer, pH 
= 9, 100 μg of SnCl2·2H
2O in 20 μL 0.05M HCl, and 1000 μg of glucoheptonate 
in 20 μL sterile water, and up to 10 mCi of Cu-64 in 1-2 μL 0.1M HCl.  The 
mixture will be heated for 90 min. at 50°C. (Please note: Since we have 
increased the dose to be administered,  we have increased the quantity of 
radioactivity to be added to  the vial. This has change d the incubation time and 
temperature. This change has no infl uence on the pharmacokinetics or the 
biological activity of the preparation). 
HPLC analysis will be performed.  A ty pical HPLC profiles given in Fig. 6 
shows 97.4% radiochemical purity. 
The mixture will then be diluted with 500 μL of 0.9% sterile NaCl solution, 
filtered through 0.22 μ filter.  4±10% mCi of this solution will be drawn into a one 
mL, sterile syringe for injection.

 27 1.8 Clinical Data to Date: 
PET Imaging of Human Breast Cancer Using Cu-64-TP3805: 
Human BC also overexpresses VPAC1 rece ptor (Fig. 3). Fig.  2.a, Fig. 2.b 
and 2.c show that Cu-64 TP3805can detects not only the primary BC (six out of 
six malignant lesions in four  patients studies so far) but  also the sentential lymph 
nodes. These data provide the evidence t hat the Cu-64-TP3805 analogue data in 
mouse model, can be successfully transla ted to accurately image human tumors 
and provide a confidence that this PC imaging investigation is worthwhile. 
In the USA and abroad, prostate cancer (PC) takes thousands of lives every 
year. Yet its early and accurate detecti on continues to be challenging. At the 
onset of PC, VPAC1, which belongs to the superfamily of G-protein coupled 
receptors, expresses in high density on PC cells, but not on benign or normal 
cells. Our extensive preclinical findings, and preliminary data in humans, have 
shown that 64Cu-TP3805 has a high affinity for VPAC1, is stable in vivo, and has 
the ability to image breast tumors in  humans and spontaneously grown PC in 
TRAMP mice. The goal was to determine the ability of 64Cu-TP3805 to image PC 
in men and to evaluate the findi ngs with pathologic examinations. 
Methods : 25 men scheduled for radical pr ostatectomy and who signed IRB 
approved consent form were PET imaged pr eoperatively. Standardized Uptake 
Values (SUVs) were determined, malignant  lesions (SUV > 1.0) were counted, 
and data compared with histologic findings.  In addition, de-paraffinized whole 
mount pathology slides (n=68) from  6 VPAC1 PET imaged patients, 3 benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients (n =9), one malignant lymph node (n=3), and 
one benign lymph node (n=3) were incubated with 64Cu-TP3805, washed with 
PBS, dried and subjected to digital autor adiography (DAR). Slides were then 
H&E stained, read by a pathologist, and DAR images were compared with foci 
delineated as PC, benign, cyst, or prosta tic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). 
Results : In 25 patients, 212 lesions had SUVs > 1.0 as compared to 127 lesions 
identified by histology. While the status of the remaining 85 PET lesions remains 
to be determined, in 68 histological slides from 6 PET imaged patients, DAR 
identified 105/107 PC foci (missed 2 due to artifact), 19/19 high grade PIN 
(HGPIN), 2/2 ejaculatory ducts (ED)  and 5/5 urethra verumontanum (UV). 
Additionally, DAR found 9 PC lesions not previously identified by histology. The 
positive and the benign lymph nodes were correctly identified by DAR, and 
for the 3/3 BPH patients without PC , and 5/5 cysts, DAR was negative. 
Conclusion : 64Cu-TP3805, a VPAC1 receptor specific biomolecule delineates 
PC lesions in vivo and ex vivo, prov ides normal images for benign masses, and 
is worthy of further studies in patients. 
   
 
In this investigation, we will use t he same preparation, Cu-64-TP3805 that 
has been prepared and used in the pr evioius human subjects with 100% 
success. Although no preparat ion will either be compounded or used out of the 
Jefferson campus, we will use a “kit” t hat will be ready to be heated following the 
  
  
 
 28 addition of 440 μL of sterile H2O and then Cu-64 activity. These kits will contain 
all chemicals in sterile, 10 mL glass vials. Reagents will be added to the vial, 
snap frozen in dry ice, lyophilized and the vials will be sealed in N2 atmosphere. 
They will be stored at 4°C and examined fo r Cu-64 labeling and shelf life stability. 
 
Such preparations will be convenient and assure consistency of reagents. Such 
kits prepared previously in our laborator y were stable for mo re than two years. 
We expect similar stability, but will be used only after careful examination of their 
reproducible and stable preparations, as  examined by HPLC. There will be only 
one patient studied at a time. The syringe containing the Cu-64-TP3805 will be 
clearly labeled with patient’s name. “Cu-64-TP3805” name, the amount of 
radioactivity, and the time at which the dose was dispensed. 
Please note that under this eIND 101550 and with all institutional 
approvals, the agent was adm inistered to nineteen fema les with known BC. All 
malignant lesions including involved lymph nodes were unequivocally delineated (100%). There were no adverse events ex cept three patients sensed flushing 
which resolved without any medication withi n a few minutes. Therefore, we will 
not change this preparation (Cu-64-TP3805) . A preprint (J Nucl Med July 2013) 
of this investigation, reference [79]. 
1.9 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
During the nineteen BC patient studies as per the suggestion by the FDA, 
a dose escalation study was performed us ing 3 mCi±10% (n=2), 3.5 mCi±10% 
(n=2), and 4 mCi±10% (n=2).   From these studies, it  was concluded that the 
image quality was much better with a 4 mCi±10% Cu-64-TP3805 dose while the 
radiation dose (liver target organ) to the liver and all other organs were well 
within the dose delivered by routine diag nostic nuclear medicine procedures.  
Based on this, FDA approved the use of 4 mCi±10% dose to the next thirteen 
patients.  In this PC PET study theref ore, we will use 4 m Ci±10% dose which is 
also approved by the FDA (eIND 101550) for this PC PET study.  We will strictly 
adhere to this dose. 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective:  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of Cu-64-
TP3805 to detect Prostate cancer  in patients with persistently elevated  PSA. 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 General Design 
This is a single institution, open-l abel pilot phase I feasibility diagnostic 
imaging study. 
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
  
  
 
 29 The primary endpoint of study will be to determi ne the ability of Cu-64-
TP3805 to detect PC foci within the pros tate gland in patient s with persistialy 
elevated PSA as compared with  tumor maps derived by histology of biopsy 
specimens obtained guided biopsy.  
3.3 Primary Safety Endpoints 
As stated previously in section 1. 9, we will use 4 mCi±10% Cu-64-TP3805 
dose given with FDA approval to fifteen of the nineteen BC patie nts.  The peptide 
quality (20 µg) will also  be kept unchanged. 
There was no toxicity in this entire study of the nineteen subjects except 
three subjects sensed flushing whic h resolved within minutes without any 
medication.  It is reasonable therefore to anticipate that in this PC study too, 
there will be no adverse events (AE) due to  dose administered.  Nevertheless, a 
physician (either Dr. Intenz o or Dr. Kim) will be available during and after the 
injection.  An up to date first aid box wi ll be available.  The Research Coordinator 
will call each subject 24 hrs later and make note of any AE patients may have 
experienced.

4.4 Subject Recruitment and Screening 
A total of 20 patients wit h persistently elevated PSA,  presented at Urology 
Associates Office of TJU, and are scheduled   for a biopsy, will be enrolled. Drs. 
E. Trabulsi, C. Lallas, and L. Gomella sha ll determine the patient  eligibility, and 
inform the PI, Dr. Mathew Thakur, and the research c oordinator, Nancy Pedano. 
Each patient shall sign an IRB approved consent form. Each patient shall be 
administered IV with 4 mCi ± 10% Cu-64-TP3805. 
4.5 Early Withdrawal of Subjects 
4.5.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects 
Patients who withdraw cons ent or who do not comple te the investigational 
imaging or who do not have radical prosta tectomy will be wit hdrawn from study 
and will not be included in the analysis. 
4.5.2 Data Collection and Follo w-up for Withdrawn Subjects 
Withdrawn subjects will be removed fr om the analysis and no follow up will 
be undertaken. 
5.0 STUDY IMAGING AGENT 
5.1 Description 
In this investigation, we will use t he same preparation, Cu-64-TP3805 that 
has been prepared and used in nineteen prev ious human BC subjects with 100% 
success. Although no preparat ion will either be compounded or used out of the 
Jefferson campus, we will use a “kit” t hat will be ready to be heated following the 
addition of 440 μL of sterile H2O and then Cu-64 activity. These kits will contain 
all chemicals in sterile, 10 mL glass vials. Reagents will be added to the vial, 
snap frozen in dry ice, lyophilized and the vials will be sealed in N2 atmosphere. 
They will be stored at 4°C and examined fo r Cu-64 labeling and shelf life stability. 
Such preparations will be convenient and assure consistency of reagents. Such 
kits prepared previously in our laborator y were stable for mo re than two years. 
We expect similar stability, but will be used only after careful examination of their 
reproducible and stable preparations, as  examined by HPLC. There will be only 
one patient studied at a time. The syringe containing the Cu-64-TP3805 will be 
clearly labeled with patient’s name.  A ll preparations were sterile.  However, 
sterility will be examined on each dose. 
5.2 Treatment Regimen 
A protocol assistant from the Urology  Department will assist with accrual 
and enrollment, and a clinical coordinator from the R adiology Department will 
guide the patient through the imaging pr ocedure. IRB approved informed consent 
  
  
 
 31 will be obtained by one of t he investigators. The patient s will be asked to read the 
IRB-approved consent form and encouraged to ask any questions they deem necessary.  Four ±10% mCi of Cu-64-TP 3805, prepared as described here in will 
be injected through an indwelling intraveno us line and the lines will be flushed 
with 5 ml sterile 0.9%  saline. Patient vital signs ( heart rate, respiratory rate, blood 
pressure) will be monitored bef ore administration, at 15 minute post injection and 
then at the end of  the sc an.  Patients will be scanned at 90 minutes with whole 
body PET/CT.  Imaging time will be approx imately one hour.  Patients will be 
contacted over the phone 24 hours late r and asked for any unlikely adverse 
events.  Any AE shall be recorded and notif ied immediately to IRB, FDA and to 
CCRRC. 
Whole body PET/CT imaging will be acquired by a trained and 
experienced technologist at Jefferson C enter City Imaging fa cility located within 
the TJU campus. Images will be read either by Dr. Intenzo or Dr. Kim.  Data will 
be recorded. Care will be taken of patient privacy. 
5.3 Risks 
Based on the previous nineteen reci pients of Cu-64-TP3805, we do not 
anticipate any adverse events after the i. v. administration of  peptide analog, the 
patients will remain in the clinic for at  least two hours and observed either by the 
technologist or by the research coor dinator. Dr. Kim and Dr. Intenzo will be 
available should their expertise be required. A first aid box equipped 
appropriately will be at hand all the time. 
Patient vital signs (heart rate, resp iratory rate, blood pressure) will be 
monitored before administration, at 15 mi nute post injection and then at the end 
of the scan.  Patients will be scanned at  90 minutes with whole body PET/CT The 
nursing staff will also watch for any flus hing or redness. Each reading will be 
recorded. 
Twenty-four hours later, we will te lephone each patient to ask for any 
adverse events the patient may ex perience. These will be recorded. 
5.4 Method for Assigning Subj ects to Treatment Groups 
Not applicable. 
5.5 Preparation and Administra tion of Study Imaging Agent 
The Cu-64 peptide analog will be prepar ed using the methods described 
previously. Sterile reagents and glassware will be used. The dose, no more than 
five mL in volume, will be dispensed.  Sterility tests wil l be performed and 
recorded. To maintain the procedure uniformity, we will prepare kits and use them for instant Cu-64 labeling. HPLC  analysis will also be performed for 
determination of radiochemical purity and data recorded. 
Four ±10% mCi of Cu- 64-TP3805, prepared as de scribed here in will be 
injected through an indwelling intravenous li ne and the lines will be flushed with 5 
ml sterile 0.9% saline.  
  
  
 
 32 5.6 Subject Compliance Monitoring 
Not applicable. 
5.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Not applicable. 
6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1 Study Visit Schedul e (see appendix 15.1) 
Screening 
Potential subjects identified by t he urologic oncologist s (Drs. Trabulsi, 
Lallas and Gomella) who have persistent ly elevated PSA, 4 or greater and 
scheduled for MRI fusion/TRUS .  The clin ical coordinator will screen the patient 
for eligibility as per the in clusion and exclusion criteria .  Eligible subjects will 
review and sign the informed consent.  The coordinator will schedule the Cu-64-
TP3805 PET imaging study at least one week but not more than 3 weeks before 
their scheduled  MRI Fusion/TURS biopsy 
Visit 1 
The clinical coordinator  will meet the subject and guide them through the 
imaging process.  They will monitor t he patient before, during and after the 
imaging study, as previously described. 
Follow-up 
The clinical coordinator will follow up with the subjects by phone the day 
after the study imaging procedure to ensure that there were no adverse 
reactions.  The coordinator s will be available as needed for the time period  until 
their scheduled  biopsy  procedure for questions or concerns. 
7.0 STATISTICAL PLAN 
7.1 Sample Size Determination 
7.2 We will study 20 patients with persistent ly elevated PSA for a Cu-64 PET 
imaging in whom  biopsy are ordered.  These patients shall be PET imaged 
with our Cu-64 peptide probe first and t hen a week or so later the image 
guided biopsy shall be performed. T he image guided biopsy is the standard 
of care procedure. The objective is to validate the PET imaging results with 
the histology of biopsy results. Genera lly, approximately 60%  of the patients 
with elevated PSA have prostate cancer. We expect 80% accuracy in identifying 20 subjects as having hi stologically determined cancer/absence 
of cancer. The 95% confidence interval of this level of accuracy for this 
sample size is + or – 17.5%. Thus  we expect to find an accuracy level 
between 62.5% to 97.5%. Please note this is a pilot study, not designed to be an efficacy determination trial. Statistical Methods 
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis 
  
  
 
 33 20 subjects completing the investigat ional imaging and undergoing  biopsy 
and PET imaged with 4 mCi ± 10% Cu-64-TP3805. 
 
7.4 Replacement of Participants 
Participants who are consented but are not dosed will be replaced 
8.0 SAFETY AND AD VERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event 
An AE is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of  the study.  Interc urrent illnesses or 
injuries should be regarded as adverse event s.  Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be adv erse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. 
A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospital stay 
 results in persistent or signi ficant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not  be immediately life 
threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize 
the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did 
not result in in-patient hospitalization or  intensive treatment of bronchospasm in 
an emergency department would typically be considered serious. 
All adverse events that do  not meet any of the cr iteria for serious should 
be regarded as non-serious adverse events . 
Adverse Event Reporting Period 
  
  
 
 34 The study period during which adver se events must be reported is 
normally defined as the period from the in itiation of any study procedures to the 
end of the study treatment follow-up.  Fo r this study, the study treatment follow-
up is defined as 24 hours followin g the study imaging procedure. 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is pr esent at the start of the study.  A 
preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, 
intensity, or the character of the c ondition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically signific ant abnormality should be recorded as a 
preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new  clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that m eet the definition of an adve rse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the in vestigator until 
the events are resolved, the su bject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the inve stigator should instruct 
each subject to report any s ubsequent event(s) that the s ubject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonabl y be related to participation in this 
study.  The investigator s hould notify the study sponsor  of any death or adverse 
event occurring at any time after a s ubject has discontinued or terminated study 
participation that ma y reasonably be related to this  study.  The sponsor should 
also be notified if the inve stigator should become awar e of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a 
subject that has participated in this study. 
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
At each contact with the s ubject, the investigator must seek information on 
adverse events by specific questioning an d, as appropriate, by examination.  
Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source 
document, and also in the appropriate adver se event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related si gns, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though should be 
grouped under one diagnosis. 
All adverse events occurring during t he study period must be recorded  
The clinical course of each event  should be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, or until it has been det ermined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the 
end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any 
serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be 
possibly related to the study  treatment or study parti cipation should be recorded 
and reported immediately. 
  
  
 
 35 8.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of 
the study at his/her site.  This safety  monitoring will include careful assessment 
and appropriate reporting of adverse ev ents as noted above, as well as the 
compliance and implementation of the KCC data and safety-monitoring plan.  Medical monitoring will incl ude a regular assessment of the number and type of 
serious adverse events by both the assigned Medical Monitor and the KCC 
DSMC. 
8.3.1 Medical Monitori ng and AE/SAE Reporting 
A Medical Monitor is a ssigned to this study at the Thomas Jefferson 
University.  This is a physic ian/pharmacist who is not dire ctly involved in the trial, 
and is not currently collaborating with the sponsor/investiga tor on any other trial.  
The role of the Medical Monitor is to re view all reportable AEs/SAEs (in real-time) 
including grading, toxicity assignments,  non-reportable AEs (quarterly), protocol 
violations/deviations, as well as all other safety data an d activity data  observed in 
the ongoing clinical trial oc curring at Thomas Jefferson  University. The Medical 
Monitor may recommend reporti ng of adverse even ts and relevant safety da ta, and 
may also recommend suspension or terminat ion of the study to the DSMC and TJU 
IRB. 
Every KCC investigator initiated protocol includes requirements for 
reporting of adverse events based on CTC 4.0. All events are reported to the IRB 
and Medical Monitor using a password pr otected web-site. In addition all 
unexpected and serious adverse events ( SAEs) are reported to the TJU IRB and 
to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if applicable. The investigator is required to submit all unexpected and se rious adverse events to the TJU IRB 
and the Medical Monitor within the timefram es outlined in the below table. All 
AE/SAEs will be reported to the DSMC at the quarterly DSMC review meetings; 
however, if the Medical Moni tor determines corrective action is necessary, an “ad 
hoc” DSMC meeting will be called. Fatal adverse events related to treatment 
which are unexpected must be reported within 24 hours to the TJU IRB and 
the DSMC. Fatalities not related to th e study drug/device must be reported 
within 5 days. A summary of the reporting requirements for KCC investigator 
initiated Phase I and Phase II studies are presented below.

Safety Reporting Requirements for IND Holders 
In accordance with 21 CFR 212.32, sponsor-investigators of studies 
conducted under an IND must comply  with following safety reporting 
requirements: 
Expedited IND Safety Reports: 
7 Calendar-Day Telephone or Fax Report:  
The Sponsor-Investigator is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or life-
threatening adverse event t hat is unexpected and assessed by the investigator to 
be possibly related to the use of Cu-64- TP3805.  An unexpected adverse event 
is one that is not already described  in the Investigator Brochure. 
Such reports are to be telephoned or  faxed to the FDA within 7 calendar 
days and insert funding sponsor within 24 hour s of first learning of the event.  
Each telephone call or fax transmissi on (see fax number below) should be 
directed to the FDA new drug review divi sion in the Center for Drug Evaluation 
and Research or in the product review division for the Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research, whichever is re sponsible for the re view of the IND 
15 Calendar-Day Written Report:   
The Sponsor-Investigator is also required to notify the FDA and all 
participating investigators,  in a written IND Safety Report, of any serious, 
unexpected AE that is considered possibly related to the use of Cu-64-TP3805. 
An unexpected adverse event is one t hat is not already described in the 
Investigator Brochure. 
Written IND Safety Reports should in clude an Analysis of Similar Events in 
accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32.  All safety reports previously filed 
with the IND concerning similar events should be analyzed.  The new report 
should contain comments on the significanc e of the new event in light of the 
previous, similar reports. 
Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events are to be 
submitted to the FDA, insert funding sponsor, and all participating investigators 
within 15 calendar days of first learni ng of the event.  The FDA prefers these 
  
  
 
 37 reports on a MedWatch 3500A Form but alte rnative formats are acceptable (e.g. 
summary letter). 
IND Annual Reports 
In accordance with the regulati on 21 CFR § 312.32, the Sponsor-
Investigator shall within 60 days of the anniversary date that the IND went into 
effect submit a brief report of the progress of the invest igation.  Please refer to 
Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR § 312. 32 for a list of the elements required 
for the annual report.  All IND annual repor ts submitted to the FDA by the 
Sponsor-Investigator should be copied to in sert funding sponsor.  Copies of such 
reports should be mailed to:  NIH,  Program Director Dr. H. Baker 
8.3.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the KCC.  The DSMC is a multidisciplinary 
committee charged with overseeing the m onitoring of safety of participants 
in clinical trials, and the conduct, progr ess, validity, and integrity of the 
data for all clinical trials at the Thomas Jefferson University KCC. The 
committee meets quarterly to  review the progress and safety of all active 
research protocols that are not monitored by another safety and data 
monitoring committee or board. 
 The DSMC meets quarterly. Additi onal DSMC meetings are scheduled 
based on the nature and number of trials  being monitored over a specified 
time period. The DSMC meets (by conference call) within 24 hours following the notification of an unexpect ed adverse event felt to be related 
to the study drug. 
 Prior to each DSMC meeting, each board member, is provided a printout 
of all reported AEs and SAEs occurring during the reporting period for this 
clinical trial. The principal inve stigator provides a detailed and 
comprehensive narrative assessment of  current adverse events to date, 
indicating their possible significanc e and whether these toxicities have 
affected the conduct of the trial. DS MC members are provided with the 
principal investigator’s  assessment, a written report summarizing adverse 
events, safety data, and activity dat a observed during the specified time 
period described in each protocol, as  well as recommendations from the 
Medical Monitor. A review of outco me results (response, toxicity and 
adverse events) and factors external to  the study (such as scientific or 
therapeutic developments) is discuss ed, and the Committee votes on the 
status of each study. 
 A summary of the board’s action is sent to each inve stigator, the CCRRC 
and Thomas Jefferson University IRBs. The DSMC actions may include recommendations/requirements that will lead to improved patient safety 
and/or efficacy, significant benefits or risks that have developed, or other 
changes determined to be necessary. The DSMC may also take note of 
  
  
 
 38 slow accrual or lack of scientific pr ogress, and refer such issues to the 
CCRRC. The DSMC provides the invest igator with the rationale for any 
decision made. 
9.0 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
9.1 Confidentiality 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed 
according to the requirements of t he Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Thos e regulations require a signed subject 
authorization informing the s ubject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects 
in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of 
their PHI. 
In the event that a subject revokes aut horization to collect or use PHI, the 
investigator, by regulation, retains the ab ility to use all information collected prior 
to the revocation of subject authorizatio n.  For subjects that have revoked 
authorization to collect or use PHI, atte mpts should be made to  obtain permission 
to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their 
scheduled study period. 
9.2 Source Documents 
Source data is all information, orig inal records of clinical findings, 
observations, or other activities in a clin ical trial necessary for the reconstruction 
and evaluation of the trial.  Source dat a are contained in source documents   
Examples of these original docum ents, and data records include: hospital 
records, clinical and office charts, labor atory notes, memoranda,  subjects’ diaries 
or evaluation checklists, pharmacy disp ensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copies or transcr iptions certified after verification as 
being accurate and complete, microfiches , photographic negatives, microfilm or 
magnetic media, x-rays, subj ect files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the 
laboratories, and at medico-t echnical departments involved in the clinical trial. 
9.3 Case Report Forms 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data colle ction instrument 
for the study.  All data r equested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data 
must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure 
was not done or the question was not asked,  write “N/D”.  If the item is not 
applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.   All entries should be printed legibly 
in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a 
single straight line through the incorrect ent ry and enter the correct data above it.  
  
  
 
 39 All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT 
ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification 
above the item, then in itial and date it. 
9.4 Records Retention 
This is a FDA regulated study.  It is the investigator’s responsibility to 
retain study essential documents for at l east 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in their count ry and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in th eir country or at least 2 years have 
elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  T hese documents should be retained for a longer period 
if required by an agreement with the sponso r.  In such an instance, it is the 
responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/ins titution as to when these 
documents no longer need to be retained. 
10.0 STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING 
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
The investigator will allocate adequate time for monitoring activities.  The 
Investigator will also ensure that the m edical monitor or other compliance or 
quality assurance reviewer is given acce ss to all the above noted study-related 
documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit. 
KCC Investigator Initiated Phase I Studies  
Phase I studies require continuous m onitoring by the PI of the study with 
quarterly safety and monitoring reports submitted to the CRMO and the DSMC. 
Each protocol is assigned to a medical monitor (a physician or other member of 
the DSMC who has expertise in the ther apeutic area of the protocol and is not 
directly involved in this trial). The medi cal monitor reviews all adverse events (in 
addition to unexpected adverse  events), safety data and ac tivity data observed in 
the ongoing clinical trial at each new dose level, prior to dose escalation. 
The PI provides a report to the DSMC  of all AE/SAEs, safety and toxicity 
data, and any corrective action that occurred on a quarterly basis. The medical monitor also provides a summary of thei r review. The summary of all discussions 
of adverse events are submitted to t he DSMC, and these reports are reviewed 
during the DSMC meetings t hat take place quarterly. Pa tients are only identified 
by initials, and no other personal health information (PHI) is included in the 
reports. 
The medical monitor may recommend reporting adverse events and 
relevant safety data not previously reported, and may recommend suspension or 
termination of the trial based on t heir review of AE/SAE data observed 
throughout the life of a clinic al trial. In such circ umstances, and “ad hoc” DSMC 
meeting will be called to discuss correct ive action with the PI. If for any reason 
the PI of the trial disagrees  with the conclusions of t he Medical Monitor or DSMC, 
  
  
 
 40 the issue will be referred to the Associate Di rector of Clinical Investigations, who 
will be responsible for dispute resolution. 
The summary of all discussions of adv erse events are included in the KCC 
investigator’s reports to the TJU IRBs as part of it s annual progress report. The 
DSMC and the TJU IRBs may, based on the monitor’s recommendation suspend 
or terminate the trial. The quarterly sa fety and monitoring reports include a 
statement as to whether this  data has invoked any stopping criteria in the clinical 
protocol. 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and 
inspections by the IRB, the funding sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and 
University compliance and quality assu rance groups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, r egulatory documents, data collection 
instruments, study data et c.).  The invest igator will ensure the capability for 
inspections of applicable study-relat ed facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic 
laboratory, etc.). 
Participation as an investigator in  this study implies acceptance of 
potential inspection by government  regulatory authorities and applicable 
University compliance and quality assurance offices. 
10.2.1 Independent External  and Internal Audits  
In addition to review by the DS MC, all studies initiated by KCC 
investigators are audited by an indepen dent auditor once they have achieved 
10% of target accrual. However, a st udy can be audited at any time based on 
recommendations by the IRB, DSMC, C CRRC and/or the Director of Clinical 
Investigations, KCC. Studi es are re-audited once they have achieved 50% of 
target accrual. Special audits may be recommended by the IRB, DSMC or 
CCRRC based on prior findings, allegations  of scientific misconduct and where 
significant irregularities are found th rough quality control procedures. Any 
irregularities identified as par t of this process would result in a full audit of that 
study. 
In addition to the audits at 10 and 50%, the CRMO randomly audits at 
least 10 percent of all patients entered into  therapeutic KCC trials  and other trials 
as necessary, on at least a bi-annual basis, to verify that there is a signed and 
dated patient consent form, t he patient has met the elig ibility criteria, and that 
SAEs are documented and reported to the TJU IRB. 
All audit reports are submitted to the DSMC for review and action (when 
appropriate). A copy of th is report and recommended DSMC action is sent to the 
CCRRC and TJU IRB. The co mmittee regards the scientif ic review process as 
dynamic and constructive rather than punitive. The review process is designed to assist Principal Investigators in ensuri ng the safety of study subjects and the 
adequacy and accuracy of any data generat ed. The TJU IRB may, based on the 
DSMC and auditor’s recommendation, suspend or terminate the trial. 
  
  
 
 41 11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
This study is to be conducted accord ing to US and international standards 
of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on 
Harmonization guidelines), applicable gover nment regulations and Institutional 
research policies and procedures. 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly 
constituted independent Instit utional Review Board (IRB ), in agreement with local

8 1. Introduction  
1.1 Study Significance  
The landmark 2014 Surgeon General’s Report concluded that for individuals with 
cancer, persistent smoking results in increased toxicity, poor cancer treatme nt, 
response, and i ncreas ed risk for disease recurrence and second primary 
cancers.1 Accordingly, in 2016 the Tobacco Control Research Working Group’s 
priorities presented to the NCI’s Board of Scientific Advisors emphasized the 
need to develop and test ef fective cessation t reatme nts for cancer patients with 
persistent tobacco use.22 We propose to conduct the first study to examine the 
effectiveness and implementation of a virtually -delivered evidence -based 
tobacco treatment into cancer care for patients at  NCORP community si tes, 
including NCORP minority/underserved community sites ( >30% of patients are 
racial/ethnic minorities or rural residents ). Since 80% of patients receive their 
cancer care in the community, 17 and as many community -based oncology 
netwo rks serve large rur al pop ulations and lack resources, this is a tremendous 
opportun ity to examine and implement an evidence -based treatment to an NCI 
priority population of vulnerable patients.  NCORP community sites identified 
evidence -based cessation serv ices as a priority.  In 20 16 the NCI -AACR Cancer 
Patient Tobacco Use Assessment Task  Force 23 delineated implementation 
strategies. Our proposal evaluates 3 of these priorities: evaluation of 1) effective 
means of delivering tobacco treatment, including mot ivational approache s and 
telemedicine; 2) the effects of cessation treatment modera tors; and 3) cost -
effectiveness.  
NCORP community sites provide access to a diverse population of cancer 
patients making them ideal for studying effectiveness and implementat ion of 
tobacco trea tment in real-world cancer care settings. The NCI recently launc hed 
NCORP to coordinate trials among its community sites, which are organized 
networks of community -based oncology programs, including 
minority/underserved community sites. The goal of NCORP i s to c onduct cancer 
control research in communities where patien ts receive their care, with a priority 
on improving access and evaluating innovative cancer care delivery models, 
particularly among underserved and underrepresented populat ions. Our proposal 
is clo sely aligned with NCORP priorities  
Tobacco use following a  cancer diagnosis is prevalent and compromises 
treatment outcomes. About 10% to 30% of cancer patients are smoking at the 
time of diagnosis, 5-8, 24, 25 and the majority of cancer patients who  smoke  at 
diagnosis continue to smoke following diagnosis.7,26 Quitting smoking upon 
cancer diagnosis may improve cancer treatment effectiveness, reduce risk of 
recurrence and of developing new primary tumors,1,13-15, 27 -30 and improve 
chances of survival.5, 31 -33 Conversely, continuing to smoke may result in 
diminishe d quality of life,5, 34 , 35 treatment delays and increased treatment 
complications.6,10-12, 36 -44 
National initiatives emphasize the importance of identifying smokers in can cer 
care settings. In 201 1, the Joint Commission and Medicare adopted National 
Hospital Quality Measures  for hospitals to report on how often hospitalized 
smokers receive cessation advice, counseling, and medication.45 Smoking status 
was designated as a co re objective in the  2010 “Meaningful Use” EHR 
documentation.46, 47 The 2013 AACR re leased guidelines emphasize the 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
9 provision of tobacco cessation services to cancer patients.48 The American 
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends cessa tion counselin g to all 
smokers as a cor e quality indicator.49 In 2015 the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN) published Smoking Cessation guidelines to formalize 
these initiatives.2We propose to implement a virtually -delivered tobacco 
treatment to help communit y cancer centers me et nat ional recommendations.  
Integrated, evidence -based services  are needed, but are lacking, during cancer 
care.  The USPHS Practice Guidelines recommend that evidence -based tobacco 
treatment – specifically, combined medication and couns eling – be delivered  to all 
smokers in health care settings, yet little progress has  been made to integrate 
these guidelines into cancer care.50 A survey of comprehensive cancer centers 
found that almost all believed that having a tobacco treatment program is “very 
important”  but o nly half had any such type of program.51 This is unfortuna te, as 
cessation closer to the time of diagnosis results in a higher likelihood for 
continued abstinence,5, 52 -55 effective interventions exist,5,52-55 and many cancer 
patie nts who smoke want to qui t smoking.52, 53, 56, 57  Additionally, little work has 
been done to explore the delivery and effectiveness of tobacco treatment among 
racial/ethnic minority cancer patients who are at risk for continued smoking. 3, 58, 
59 Lastly, t obacco use remains unaddr essed after treatment completion.60 A 
recent national stud y61 found that smokers treated for cancer were significantly 
more likely than smokers without cancer to try to quit smoking.  
Tobacco use is not being assessed or intervened upon during cancer care. 
Assessment of tobacco dependence among cancer patients is lacking; 62-64 in 
particular, rates of smoking assessment are lower in non -academic medical 
settings (i.e., community settings).65 Unfortunately, during treatment, many 
smok ers are not advised  to qu it,66, 67 and most cancer patients do not get 
assistance ( e.g., medications, counseling) to quit and/or stay quit.68-70 Only 30% -
40% of oncologists provide assistance to help patients quit smoking. 62, 63, 71  
Furthermore, tobacco use assessments and  cessa tion support have not been 
incorporated in most cooperativ e group clinical trials.72 Lack of adequate training, 
lack of expertise in providing cessation treatment, and lack of patient support 
resources such as dedicated cessation c ounseling programs,  have been 
reported as leading impediments to implementation of cessation treatment in 
cancer care. 51, 62, 63 
Cancer patients who smoke have socioeconomic, biologic and psychosocial 
vulnerabilities. Individuals with lower incomes and ed ucation have a high er 
prevalence of smoking.73, 74, 75  Dr. Park found that Cancer Care Outcomes 
Research & Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) participants who were smoking 
at diagnosis had less education and more often had public health insurance 
(p<.001).7 Cancer patients a re at risk of financial hardship.76 A recent study of 
Medicaid p atients demonstrated that barriers to treatment access still exist.77,78 
Cancer patients who report persistent smoking need intensive treatment, often 
endorsing high rates o f nicotine dependen ce and  household smoking.79 Cancer 
patients who smoke often expe rience internalized stigma; 80, 81 smokers who 
perceive stigma are less likely to disclose their smoking status and receive 
needed treatment.82 NCORP community sites enable us to reach vulnera ble 
cancer patients.  
Implementation of tobacco treatment into co mmunity cancer centers wou ld be 
facilitated by cost data.  A significant barrier to translation of behavioral 
interventions into practice is failure to conduct analyses of in tervention costs.83 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
10 Emerg ing health care finance mechanisms that move away from fee -for-service 
payment (accountable care organization, episode -based payment, etc.) will 
heighten the demand for cost data. Smoking cessation trials conducted with 
cancer pati ents have  not exami ned tr eatment costs. Our current R01 trial results 
will contribu te the first cost analyses of smoking cessation treatments for cancer 
patients at the time of diagnosis, but these are limited to comprehensive cancer 
centers. The proposed trial will extend t his wo rk and be the first cost analyses to 
be conducted in cance r community settings.  
Implementation outcomes to be gained from the proposed hybrid -
effectiveness trial.  In summary, the NCI, ASCO, AACR, and NCCN promote 
incorporating toba cco treatment into the de livery of cancer care, but this has 
never been done in com munity cancer centers. Trial findings will establish the 
effectiveness and cost of utilizing a virtual strategy to deliver evidence -based 
tobacco treatment in community onco logy settings and p rovide  detailed initial 
data on implementation processes that wi ll inform subsequent testing of multi -
level implementation strategies for broad national dissemination into community 
cancer care settings.  
Building on current work to enhan ce virtual tobacco treatm ent delivery.  Our 
preliminary R01 (the Smokefree Support S tudy 1) data demonstrates that an 
intensive tobacco treatment, delivered in -person (during outpatient and inpatient 
cancer center appointments) and via phone, targeted to th e needs of recently  
diagn osed cancer patients (breast, lung, GU, GI, ob/gyn, lympho ma, head and 
neck, and melanoma), is effective. We believe that face -to-face contact is an 
important ingredient in patient -counselor rapport. In our previous study, patients  
had the opportunit y to m eet counselors in -person during treatments, but the wide 
geographic distribution of cancer clinics within community -based setting limits the 
ability for tobacco treatment access and in -person contact. Recent pilot studies 
reported on the feasibility of usi ng videoconferencing to deliver psychosocial care 
to cance r patients,117-119 and behavioral interventions using videoconferencing 
technology have been found to be as effective as in -person delivery. 120-123 There 
have been only two  studies using vide oconfe rencing to deliver smoking cessation 
programs, but both required patients to come into clinics  to use the technology; 
both found it to be feasible to deliver and reported high reported patient 
satisfaction. Dr. Carlson concluded th at videoconferencin g deli vered cessation 
groups  produced quit rates similar to  in-person  groups.120 Dr. Richter compared a 
videoconferencing -delivered program, delivered within  primary care clinics, to a 
telephone -delivered program and found that videoconf erencing increased 
utilization of cessation medication.124 To our knowledge, our st udy is the first to 
offer virtual delivery, via remote videoconference, of a tobacco treatment to 
cancer patients. We will leverage existing systems; we developed 
English/Sp anish treatment pro tocols , electronic data capture systems, 
medication algorithms, cost tracking templates, and motivational interviewing 
counseling fid elity and supervision materials . The proposed trial improves reach 
by: 1) using videoconferencing to bri ng a tobacco counse lor (s ynchronous visits) 
directly to patients; 2) bringing tobac co treatment into community cancer centers; 
3) offering tobacco treatment to diverse patients; and 4) incorporating 
involvement of cancer clinicians, t hrough delivery of bri ef videos .

Dr. Park has conducted multisite tobacco treatment trials wit h cancer patients 
and low SES smokers.85, 125 -127 Dr. Park directed an efficacious 24 -site RCT to 
test a smoking cessation intervention for childhood cancer survivors assign ed to 
a telephone -based p eer motivational counseling plus NRT patch intervention 
versus usual care.125,126 Drs. Park and Rigotti collaborated on an RCT for 607 
low-SES, English and Spanish -speaking smokers that compared quitline referral 
to phone -based mot ivational counselin g call s with a tobacco counselor 
embedded in the health care sys tem and NRT.84 The intervention significantly 
increased tobacco abstinence at 9 months compared to usual care (18% vs. 8%; 
p<.001). Drs. Rigotti and Park also collaborated o n an RCT of a smoki ng 
cessation intervention for 397 hospitalized smokers.95 An intervention using 
automated calls (IVR) and free NRT was significantly more efficacious compared 
to quitline referr al (26% vs.15%; p<.01). Dr. Pa rk conducted a pilot smoking 
cessation study which support ed the feasibility of an Intensive Treatment 
(motivational counseling plus varenicline) vs. usual care for patients at the MGH 
thoracic clinic.79 Dr. Ostroff led a rand omize d trial evaluating the ef ficacy of a 
gradual smoking tapering intervention combined  with nicotine patch in 185 
cancer patients awaiting hospitalization for surgical treatment (6 -month 
abstinence was 32%).128 Dr. Ostroff  also co -led a large cluster,randomiz ed trial 
testing th e effe ctiveness of several systems -level, implementation strateg ies to 
improve adherence to tobacco treatment guidelines in community -based public 
health dental clinics.129 In June 2016, Drs. Park, Ostroff and Perez participated in 
a new  NCI initiative, SP eeding  Research -tested INTerventions which focuses on 
integratin g research trial -based interventions into real -world settings. They 
conducted 30 interviews with stakeholders to discuss barriers to implementing 
tobacco treatment training and programs for on cology  patients. These interviews 
confirmed 1) the need for a na tional tobacco treatment program, 2) the need for 
tobacco treatment delivery to be specialized for cancer patients, and 3) that 
oncology clinicians, although strongly suppor tive of tobacco tre atment  for their 
patients, lacked tobacco treatment training exp erience and time.130 In September 
2016, Drs. Wagner , Park and Ostroff were awarded an NCI supplement to 
administer the AACR tobacco assessment to 1000 patients (at enrollme nt, 3 and 
6 months) in EC OG/ACRIN NCORP tria ls to determine the effects of tobacco u se 
on patient’s a) physical and psychological symptoms and b) cancer treatment 
duration, dose intensity, and therapeutic benefit. These developments strengthen 
the team’s a bility to assess imp lemen tation of tobacco treatment in cancer care 
settings.  
1.2.1  Curren t R01 preliminary findings  (Smokefree Support Study 1) . 
The proposed study was informed by the recently completed RCT 
which Drs. Park and Ostroff conduct ed at MGH and Memor ial Sloan 
Kettering (MSK)  to assess integration of an Intensive Treatment (IT; 
11 se ssions of motivational counseling, in -person and phone, plus 
choice of FDA -approved medication) versus MSK’s usual care with 
recently diagnosed cancer patients (4 sessions of MI counseling plu s 
FDA-approved medication advice).127Among patients who are 
potentially eligible based on chart screen, approximately one -third 
enrolled; among known eligible smokers who agreed to be screened, 
70% enrolled. Based on preliminary analyse s as of February 201 8, 
303 patients were  enrolled  and randomized to a treatment arm  (56% 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
12 female, mean age = 58; 82% white, non -Hispanic; 10 % Black; 5.0% 
Hispanic). This includes patients diagnosed with thoracic, head and 
neck, GI, GU, breast, lymphoma,  melanoma, and ob/gyn c ancer s. 
Using intention -to-treat analyses counting non -responder s as 
“smokers”  (86% 6-month survey response rate and 87% cotinine 
validation response rate), cotinine validated 6 -month abstinence rates 
are 19% in the Standard Care group and 33% in the Inten sive 
Treatment group ( p<.02). Using intention -to-treat, 57% of I ntervention 
Treatment group participants were adherent to sustained counseling 
(> 7 sessions), which was associated with increased 6 -month quit 
rates (p<.0001).  These data support preliminary effec tiveness of the 
proposed intervention treatment . 
1.3 Approach  
1.3.1  Design Overview  
We propose a hybrid -effectiveness design,18 Hybrid Type 1 enabling 
us to test the effectiveness of our clinical intervention while also 
gathering key informa tion on its delivery  and potential for 
implementation in a real -world situation. Thi s design choice fits the 3 
recommended conditions for Hybrid Type 1 use, specifically: 1) strong 
face validity for the intervention that would support applicability to the 
new setting (NCORP c enter s), population (more diverse cancer 
patients), or delivery method (synchronous videoconferencing); 2) 
strong base of indirect evidence (data from different but associated 
populations) for the intervention; and 3) minimal risk assoc iated with 
the inter venti on, both its direct risk and any indirect risk through 
replacement of a known adequate intervention. Our design compares 
the effectiveness and implementation of Enhanced Usual Care (EUC: 
Asking about tobacco use, Advising current t obacco users to quit  and 
Referral to NCI Q uitline) versus an evidence -based Virtual 
Intervention Treatment (VIT; Asking about tobacco use, Advising 
current tobacco users to quit and Referral to a centralized NCORP 
tobacco coach for a videoconferencing inte rvention).  
1.3.2  Virtual A pproa ch: Referral and Delivery  
An IT platform  will be used to re cruit patients to the study  via a Virtual 
Clinician Referral . Brief, educational videos will be created for  
patients. Through this virtual clinician referral , clinicians ca n engage in 
a suppor tive collaborative care approach to underscore the 
importance of  cancer patients addressing their tobacco use and 
encouraging treatment participation.  
These brief videos can be accessed via a computer, tablets , or 
smartphones , and sent via secure email pla tform. To enhance patient 
engagement and standardized clinician care delivery, MGH staff will 
be available to support our brief video  development and 
implementation. Working with the MGH team, we will develop a brief 
(approximately  1-2 minutes) video that introduces the study and 
encourages participation in the study. These videos will build on our 
extensive experience in recruiting and retaining participants in study 
trials.  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
13 In an effort to standardize usual care, a script  will be provi ded to each 
individu al site, and the virtual clinician referral  will be recorded by a 
site-designated oncology provider at each participating NCORP 
center. These brief videos will introduce the tobacco treatment 
program and ask about smoking behavior, norm alize tobacco use to  
decrease internalized stigma, advise  cancer patients of the 
importance of quitting/decreasing their smoking, encourage 
behavioral and medication support, refer patients to the program, and 
encourage follow -up with the treatment group r eferral.  
1.3.3  Conceptual Frame work for Treatment  
Our tobacco counseling sessions, which a ddress tobacco use in the 
context of a cancer diagnosis, combines two theoretical lenses —a 
coping with illness model and a health behavior change model. The 
Self-Regulation  Model (SRM)147,148 focus es on the dynamic process 
between beliefs, emotions and cop ing, and has been widely used to 
study patients’ coping with canc er. Applying the SRM to a cancer 
diagnosis, changes in beliefs about cancer outcomes may lead 
smokers to en gage in quitting as a strategy to cope with the cognitive 
and emotional threat of ca ncer. If individuals’ evaluation of the effects 
of quitting, physical changes (e.g., breathing has improved) and 
environmental influences (e.g., smokefree home), make them feel 
better, then th ey wi ll stay quit. If quitting smoking decreases a sense 
of sham e and anxiety, this will increase chances of staying quit. The 
HBM149 posits that when faced with a health threat, individuals are 
more likely to change a behavior if they feel the threat is s eriou s, they 
are at risk, they are able to make the change, and the cha nge would 
decrease their risk. Applying the Health Belief Model (HBM) to a 
cancer diagnosis, smokers will be more likely to engage in tobacco 
treatment and quit if t hey 1) believe that conti nued smoking after a 
cancer diagnosis threatens health, 2) understand that continuing to 
smoke puts them at risk for poor outcomes, 3) are confident they can 
quit, and 4) believe quitting will improve outcomes.  
1.3.4  Rationale  for NRT  
The selection of combi natio n NRT is based on the current 
recommendations for the NCCN Smoking Cessation Guidelines2 and 
data from our prior clinical trial demonstrating safety and strong 
patient preferences. Smokefree Support Study 1  intervention arm 
partici pants were  offered a  choice of NRT (patch and /or lozenge) , 
bupropion sustained relea se (Zyban, Wellbutrin), or varenicline 
(Chantix) . In preliminary analyses as of February 2018, 80% of 
Intervention Treatment group participants elected to receive a 
smoking  cessation medicatio n, am ong which 83% selected NRT.  
Reported NRT medication side ef fects have been minor (e.g., tingling 
sensation on tongue, vivid dreams). Thus, given patient preferences 
and safety results from the R01 trial, combined with the ability t o 
deliver the NRT vi a mai l, patch and lozenge will be used in this trial. 
Additional ly, NRT is being used by many state quitlines, has 
successfully been used with cancer patients,150,151 is available over -
the-counter, and is covered by Medicaid and many pr ivate insurers. 
Lastly, the NCCN guidelines concluded that b lood2 nicotine levels 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
14 from NRT, including combination NRT, are significantly less than from 
smoking cigarettes; additionally, there is insufficient evidence that 
NRT causes cancer in humans or inc reases risk of myoca rdial 
infarction or cardiovascular disease.51,152,153 
1.3.5  Counseling  Approach  
Counselors will contact patients directly (via phone, e -mail,  or text 
messaging) to schedule the virtual counseling sessions. Counseling 
sessions will be conduct ed via MGH TeleHealt h, which  connects 
providers to patients through virtual HIPAA -compliant 
videoconferencing technology including: phone, video, email, mob ile 
applications and remote monitoring. These virtual visits are conducted 
via a videoconference pla tform that addresses  clinica l privacy and 
security (e.g., Zoom, Doximity, or other H IPPA -compliant platform). 
2017 Pew findings154, 155 showed that 74% of a dults ages 50 -64 
(average projected age of proposed study sample) own Smart 
Phones, and 87% use the internet; thus, a we b-based option is a 
feasible modality.156 
The VIT session materi als have been created at the 8th grade reading 
level.160 The counseling will be delivered by a study -designated 
tobacco treatment coach based at MGH and trained in a Motiva tional 
Interviewing (MI) sty le161-162, structured according to the 5As format 
and pe rsonalized to participant’s cessation readiness and cancer 
treatment phase (initiation, transitions, surveillance) . MI is an 
empathic and supportive style of treatment 161 for smoking 
cessation ,162 proven effective in treating low SES smokers and 
smokers wi th medical co -morbidities.16,85 Dr. Park has effectively used 
MI to promote quitting among childhood cancer survivors an d lung 
cancer patients.79,126 MI is particularly eff ective with cancer p atients;  1) 
MI focuses on building and maintaining self -confiden ce, and our pilot 
work showed that cancer patients report low confidence; 2) the main 
MI tools (e.g., affirmations, refl ections) are effective when addressing 
sensitive top ics, such as cancer and smok ing-related beliefs (e.g., 
shame, fear of recurrence), a nd in delivering sensitive information 
(e.g., risks of smoking during cancer treatment);161 and 3) MI skills will 
encour age and sustain quit motivation.  
Of note, the interv ention counseling as  deliver ed here is a psycho -
educational program, and is not bein g delivered as clinical care.

15 2. Objectives  
We propose to conduct the first study to examine the effectiveness and implem entation 
of a virtually -delivered, evidence -based to bacco treatment into  cancer care for patients 
in community oncology settings. Our st udy is designed to compare the effectiveness and 
implementation of an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC; control group) versus a Virtual 
Intervention Treatment (VIT; intervention gr oup) for tobacco ces sation i n newly 
diagnosed cancer patients who smoke. Trial findi ngs will establish the effectiveness and 
cost of utilizing a virtual strategy to deliver evidence -based tobacco treatmen t in 
community oncology settings and provide detaile d initial data on im plementa tion 
processes that will inform subsequent testing of mu lti-level implementation strategies for 
broad national dissemination into community cancer care settings.  
2.1 Study Aims : 
2.1.1  Aim 1: To assess treatment effectiveness, by comparing  the 
proportions of particip ants in the Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) and 
Virtual Tobacc o Treatment (VIT) study arms abstinent post 
enrollment .  
2.1.2  Aim 2:  To assess the potential effect of  potential moderators ( e.g., 
sociodemographics, medical  and smoking history , cancer variables) 
on treat ment effectiveness between the two arms.  
2.1.3  Aim 3:  To asses s the processes of implementation and dissemination 
(acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, treatment fidelity, cost 
effectiveness, penetration/reach, and sustainability ) of delivering  
tobacco trea tment intervention s at community oncology sites.  
2.2 Primary  Objective:  
2.2.1  Treatment effectiveness (Aim 1)  
To compare the proportions of participants in the Enhanced Usual 
Care (EUC) and Virtual Tobacco Treatment (VIT) study arms with 
biochemically -verifi ed 7-day point -prevalence abstinence from 
cigarettes at 6-months  post enrollment.  
We will define biochemically -verified 7 -day point -prevalence 
abstinence at 6 month follow -up by:  
• saliva cotinine (<  15 ng/ml) , or 
• expired air CO (<  10ppm)  
2.3 Secondary O bjective s: 
2.3.1  Secon dary treatment effectiveness (Aim 1)  
Secondary smoking o utcomes (5) include : 
• Biochemically -verified 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 3 -
months follow -up 
• Self-reported 7 -day point prevalence cigarette abstinence at 3 - 
and 6 -months follow -up 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
16 • Signi ficant r eduction  (> 50% reduction in reported number of 
cigarett es per day)  in daily smoking from baseline to 3 - and 
baseline to 6-months follow -up 
• Continuous (no self -reported smoking  since last survey point) and 
sustained abstinence a t 6 months  (cotinine -verifie d at 3-months 
and 6 -months)  
2.4 Exploratory O bjectives  
Aim 2 : To assess the potential effect of known and potential moderators on 
treatment effectiveness between the two arms.  
Exploratory analyses will examine the moderator  and medi ator effects on 
treatment ef fectiveness (Aim 2).  
Moderators /Mediators  of primary int erest:  
• Sociodemographics:  Sex, age, marital status, race/ethnicity, education level, 
financial burden , health insurance,  internet and smartphone access and 
modality  
• Smoking  history:  Years smok ed, dail y smoking rate, other tobacco/nicotine 
use (e.g., cigars , cigarettes), current/past use of tobacco treatments, nicotine 
dependence  
• Cancer variables:  Cancer type, cancer stage, treatment, and days since 
diagnosis  
• Site characteris tics: Site, geograph ic locat ion, clinic volume, baseline 
organizational readiness, s ite usual care  
Additional moderators /mediators  to be explored:  
• Medical history:  ECOG Performance Status,  alcohol use  
• Quality of life/emotions:  Emotional distress, coping, anxiety, depression  
• Cancer an d smoking beliefs:  Stigma,  quit motivation, self -efficac y to quit, 
importance of quitting, perceived benefits of quitting smoking , quit -smoking 
medication beliefs  
• Physical symp toms:  Cravings  
• Environmental influences:  Level of se cond -hand smoke expo sure, pe rceived 
social support , perceived provider support  
Aim 3 : To assess the processes of implementation and dissemination 
(acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, treatment fidel ity, cost effectiveness, 
penetration/reach, and sust ainability) of our i ntervent ion at community oncology 
sites 
Guided by Proctor and co lleagues’ (2011) recommendations for measurement of 
implementation outcomes, we will explore the following to gain an in itial 
understanding of the  implementation process (A im 3).  
Implementatio n Outcom es 
• Acceptability:  Patient satisfaction with content/deli very of their randomly 
assigned tobacco treatment  
• Adoption:  Site program uptake, changes in organizational readiness  to deliver 
tobacco treatment  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
17 • Appropriateness:  Perceived  fit and relevance o f the VIT and EUC 
intervention s from the perspective of represen tative site staff 
• Tobacco Treatment fidelity:  Delivery of all components of the Smokefree 2.0 
Study Treatment Interventi ons (EUC and VIT).  
• Cost:  Incremental cost per quit o f the VIT interventi on relat ive to the EUC 
control over the 6 -month follow -up period  
• Feasibility:  Ease of delivery and suitability for routine care of the VIT and 
EUC intervention s 
• Penetration/Reach:  Patient participation rate at each site, reasons for study 
ineligibility and refusal , comparison of sociodemographic and cancer variable 
characteristics of enrollees and refusers of the study  
• Sustainability:  Resources needed and preference for a site -based cen tralized 
tobacco treatment program  
Using existing staff data collection  survey and interview tools as well as synthesis 
of notes from m inutes of monthly meetings with CCDR Leads and study 
investigators, we will enhance our understanding of the implementation process 
(Aim 3) by: 1) examining organizational characteristics that  influence adoption of 
tobacco treatment interventions; and 2) i dentifying and developing strategies to 
address barriers for impleme ntation of tobacco use assessment and treatment in 
the trial. This exploratory research will add to the limited knowledge ab out 
contextual factors influencing the engagement of community o ncology sites in the 
adoption of tobacco use assessment and treatmen t; and inform how best to 
engage community oncology practices in the integration of smoking cessation in 
cancer care.

18 3. Participant Selection  
3.1 Selection of NCORP Si te Staff Participants  
In order to achieve Aim 3, we will enroll a subset of staff (n=approximately 110) 
from a minimum of 11 participating NCORP sites. We are seeking to elicit  
implementation process perspectives fro m key stakeh olders (clinicians and 
resea rch administration staff ) who would most likely be instrumental in making 
tobacco use assessment and treatment routine part of cancer care. Guided by 
his/her knowledge of key s takeholders’ roles and responsibilities,  the Cancer 
Care Delivery Research (CCDR ) Leader and site PI fro m each participating site 
will be responsible for identifying approximately 10 multidisciplinary staff 
members to complete brief (approximately 15 minut e) surveys and participate in 
focus grou p interviews  (approximately 45 -60 minute s). The focus group inte rview 
will be conducted approximately 24 -36 months after site activation, upon the 
completion of 36-month follow -up surveys by the site. Although specific site staff 
participant composition wi ll vary somewha t by site, we envision parti cipation of 
the CCDR Leader, the Site PI, 2 -3 oncology nurses, 2 -3 additional medical 
oncologists and 2 -3 additional staff members.  
In terms of eligibility criteria, eligible N CORP site staff participants will be English -
speakin g, employed at the NCORP sit e for at least three months, and able to 
provide informed consent to participate in this study (see Informed Consent for 
NCORP Staff). The CCDR Lead and Site PI will be respons ible for consenting 
each other and th e other staff p articipants. The CCDR Lead w ill update the 
REDCap  Roster survey with the dates of consent for each participant. The 
consent date entered into the MSK REDCap Roster survey will be used as the 
source docume ntation by MSK staff to send out  the baseline survey  to those 
consented particip ants. Given the minim al risk, minimal burden and broad 
relevance of this research to CCDR priorities for enhancing high quality cancer 
care, we do not anticipate any difficulty  recruiting staff participants. In th e event 
that th ere is staff turnover, the C CDR Leader will be re sponsible for identifying 
one or more replacement staff participants who will provide 12 and 36-month 
follow -up surveys and participate in the focus group interview. Given our 
assumption that the selected st aff represent key site stake holders and that the 
quantitative (baseline, 12 and 36-month follow -up surveys) and qualitative data 
(focus group interview) will be analyzed at the level of the site, some var iation in 
pre- and post -trial partici pants will is a llowable and will not dimini sh the 
accomplishment  of Aim 3 . 
3.1.1  Staff Eligibility Criteria  
3.1.1.1  Must be English speaking

This s tudy is supported by the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  
IRB Approval:  
For CTEP and Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) studies open to the National Clinical 
Trials Network (NCTN) and NCI Com munity Oncology Research Program (NCORP) 
Research Bases af ter March 1, 2019, all U.S. -based sites must be members of the NCI 
Central Institutional Review Board (NCI CIRB). In addition, U.S. -based sites must accept 
the NCI CIRB review to activate new studie s at the site after March 1, 2019. Local IRB 
review will c ontinue to be accepted for studies that are not reviewed by the CIRB, or if 
the study was previously open at the site under the local IRB. International sites should 
continue to submit Research Ethi cs Board (REB) approval to the CTSU Regulatory 
Office foll owing country -specific regulations.  
Sites participating with the NCI CIRB must submit the Study Specific Worksheet for 
Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB using IRBManager to indicate their intent to o pen the 
study locally. The NCI CIRB’s approval of the SSW is automatically communicated to the 
CTSU Regulatory Office, but sites are required to contact the CTSU Regulatory Office at 
CTSURegPref@ctsu.coccg. org to establish site preferences for applying NCI CIRB 
approvals across their Signatory Network. Site preferences can be set at the network or 
protocol level. Questions about establishing site preferences can be addressed to the 
CTSU Regulatory Office by  emailing the email address above or calling 1 -888-651-
CTSU (2878).  
In addition, the Site -Protocol Principal Investigator (PI) (i.e., the investigator on the 
IRB/REB approval) must meet the following criteria to complete processing of the 
IRB/REB approval record:  
• Holds an Active CTEP status;  
• Rostered at the site on the IRB/REB approval (applies to US and Canadian sites 
only) and on at least one participating roster;  
• If using NCI CIRB, rostered on the NCI CIRB Signatory record;  
• Includes the IRB number of the  IRB providing approval in the Form FDA 1572 in the 
RCR pr ofile; and  
• Holds the appropriate CTEP registration type for the protocol.  
Additional Requirements

Patient Enrollment  
Patients must not start protocol intervent ion prior to registration.  
The Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN) is a web -based registration system 
available on a 24/7 basis. OPEN is integrated with CTSU regulatory and roster data and 
with the Lead Protocol Organization (LPOs) registration/rand omization systems or 
Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient 
registration/rand omization assignment. OPEN will populate the patient enrollment data in 
NCI’s clinical data management system, Medidata Rave.  
Requirements for OP EN access:  
• A valid CTEP -IAM account;  
• To perform enrollments  or request slot reservations: Be on a LPO roster, E TCTN 
Corresponding roster, or PO roster with the role of Registrar. Registrars must hold a 
minimum of an AP registration type;  and 
• Have an appro ved site registration for a protocol prior to patient enrollment.  
To assign an Investigator (IVR) or Non -Physician Investigator (NPIVR) as the treating, 
crediting, consenting, drug shipment (IVR only), or receiving investigator f or a patient 
transfer in OP EN, the IVR or NPIVR must list the IRB number used on the site’s IRB 
approval on their Form FDA 1572 in RCR. Prior to accessing OPEN, site staff should 
verify the following:  
• All eligibi lity criteria have been met within the proto col stated timeframes.

4.7.4  Medidata Rave is a clinical data manage ment system being used for 
data collection for this trial/study. Access to the trial in Rave is 
controlled through the CTEP -IAM system and role assignments.  
Requirements to access Rave v ia iMedidata: : 
• A valid and active CTE P-IAM account; and  
• Assigned a Rave role on the LPO or PO roster at the enrolling site 
of: Rave CRA, Rave Read Only, Rave CRA (LabAdmin), Rave 
SLA, or Rave Investigator. To hold Rave CRA or Rave CRA (Lab 
Admin) role, sit e staff must hold a minimum of an AP registration 
type;  
Rave role requirements:  
• Rave CRA or Rave CRA (Lab Admin) role must have a minimum 
of an Associate Plus (AP) registration type;  
• Rave Investigator role must be registered as an Non -Physician 
Investigato r (NPIVR) or Investigator (IVR); and  
• Rave Read Only ro le must have at a minimum an Associates (A) 
registration type.  
Refer to https://ctep.cancer.gov/investigatorResources/default.ht m for 
registration types and documentation required.  
Upon initial site registration approval fo r the study in Regulatory 
Support System (RSS), all persons with Rave roles assigned on the 
appropriate roster will be sent a study invitation e -mail from iMedi data. 
To accept the invitation, site staff must log in to the Select Login 
(https://login.imedid ata.com/selectlogin ) using their CTEP -IAM 
username and password, and click on the accept link in the upp er 
right-corner of the iMedidata page. Site staff will not be able to access 
the study in Rave until all required Medidata and study specific 
trainings are completed. Trainings will be in the form of electronic 
learnings (eLearnings),and can be accessed by  clicking on the link in 
the upper right pane of the iMedidata screen. If an eLearning is 
required and has not yet been taken, the link to the eLearning  will 
appear under the study name in iMedidata instead of the Rave EDC 
link; once the successful complet ion of the eLearning has been 
recorded, access to the study in Rave will be granted, and a Rave 
EDC link will display under the study name.   
Site staff that have not previously activate d their iMedidata/Rave 
account at the time of initial site registration  approval for the study in 
RSS will also receive a separate invitation from iMedidata to activate 
their account. Account activation instructions are located on the CTSU 
website in the R ave section under the Rave resource materials 
(Medidata Account Activat ion and Study Invitation Acceptance).

4.7.4.1  The Data Quality Portal (DQP) provides a central location 
for site staff to manage unanswered queries and form 
delinque ncies, monitor data quality and timeliness, 
generate reports, and revie w metrics.  
The DQP is located on the CTSU members’ website under 
Data Management. The Rave Home section displays a 
table providing summary counts of Total Delinquencies 
and Total Queri es. DQP Queries, DQP Delinquent Forms 
and the DQP Reports modules are a vailable to access 
details and reports of unanswered queries, delinquent 
forms, and timeliness reports. Review the DQP modules 
on a regular basis to manage specified queries and 
delinqu ent forms.  
The DQP is accessible by site staff that are rostered to a 
site and have access to the CTSU website. Staff that have 
Rave study access can access the Rave study data using 
a direct link on the DQP.  
To learn more about DQP use and access, click o n the 
Help icon displayed on the Rave Home, DQP Queries, and 
DQP Delinq uent Forms modules.  
NOTE:  Some Rave protocols may not have delinquent 
form details or reports specified on the DQP. A 
protocol must have the Calendar functionality 
implemented in Rave b y the Lead Protocol 
Organization (LPO) for delinquent form details 
and reports to be available on the DQP. Site 
staff should contact the LPO Data Manager for 
their protocol regarding questions about Rave 
Calendaring functionality.  
4.7.5  ECOG -ACRIN Systems for Ea sy Entry of Patient Reported Outcomes 
(EASEE -PRO) System  
We will use a combination of EASEE -PRO and mailed questionnaires 
for this study. A proxy or family member can complete the 
questionnaires on behalf of the patient as lo ng as they can speak 
English or Spanish. The questionnaires are only available in English 
or Spanish.  
Access to the study in EASEE -PRO is granted to all participants 
registered to the study through the OPEN registration system with a 
valid participant email address. Upon registration, an account 
verification email will be sent to the user with a link to ac tivate their 
account. The user will be required to enter some verification 
information (e.g. DOB) in order to activate their EASEE -PRO account. 
Additionally, site persons with the appropriate roles i n RSS will be 
granted access a fter IRB approval is obtain ed. In some studies, this 
access may allow CRAs to assist the participant accessing baseline 
surveys, educational materials, or other EASEE -PRO materials.  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
29 EASEE -PRO Participant Access:  
To access EASE E-PRO, the participant must have an active EASEE -
PRO user  account. Upon registration to the study in OPEN, an 
account activation email will be sent to the address entered for the 
participant in OPEN eligibility checklist. This email address must be a 
valid email address for the participant. All participants in t he 
EAQ171 CD Study are required to have access to the internet and a 
valid email address to participate. (If the patient email address were 
entered incorrectly in OPEN, the CRA must contact the  OEAU ( pro-
help@stat.brown.edu  to manually correct the error.) To activate their 
account, users must click the link in the email and verify their account 
before they can login and complete surveys  or view web education 
materials. Once the account is act ivated, participants may login to the 
EASEE -PRO system through the OEAU -PRIDE web portal 
(https://pride.stat.brown.edu/Participant -Login ). Upon login, users will 
be presented with a list of ava ilable surveys and materials they can 
view.  
EASEE -PRO CRA Access:  
To access EASEE -PRO, the site user must have an active CTEP IAM 
account ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam ). In addition, site users 
that are a member of ECOG -ACRI N must have the mapped ECO G-
ACRIN roles or explicit Rave roles (Rave CRA) in RSS at the enrolling 
site. Site users that are not members of ECOG -ACRIN must have the 
Rave roles on the CTSU roster at the enrolling sites. The Site 
Admi nistrator or Data Adminis trator at the enrolling si te may assign 
the appropriate roles from the Site Roles tab on the CTSU website. To 
login, CRAs will use their CTSU(IAM) credentials on the OEAU -
PRIDE web portal ( https://pride.stat.brown.edu/CRA -Login ) using the 
familiar IAM inte rface.  No e -learnings are  required for use of this site.  
The ECOG -ACRIN Outcomes and Economics Assessment Unit can 
be contacted for Patient Reported Outcome Questions via emai l at 
pro-help@stat.brown.edu . An EASEE -PRO instructional guide for 
both sites an d patients can be found on  both the E -A and CTSU 
websites.  
Please see below for additional details on the EASEE -PRO system.  
1. A sec ure environment for control of user records, information, and 
transactions (SECURIT): Provides a secure – limited access poi nt 
for entering data into the  restricted secure PII Database, for 
management of user data, creating user accounts, and reporting. 
The SECURIT web management interface requires the secure 
hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) to ensure encryption of 
transmitt ed data.  
a) PII database: is a dedicated secure limited access database, 
used to store protected PII.  
i) Secure: All communications to the PII database through 
SECURIT are encrypted. The database resides behind a 
firewall and cannot be reach from outside t he OEAU.  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
30 ii) Limited access: this database is restricted not only by 
username and password but is also restricted to specified 
internal OEAU computers by IP address, so that only 
authorized users logging in at the OEAU from pre -specified 
computers may acce ss/enter PII.  At no time is outside 
access allowed to this database.  
iii) Protected restricted PII (e.g. SSN) are encrypted at the 
time of data entry and double data entered for verification. 
All users regardless of their security level are blinded to 
this protected data, and it cann ot be decrypted without the 
encryption key, housed in a safe, in a location separate 
from the OEAU. Thi s type of data is generally collected for 
long term follow -up where it may be needed to be 
decrypted for select patients in order to search registries 
like the national death index to determine survival status of 
lost participants. In these instances, with  appropriate 
approvals, the Database Administrator will decrypt this 
data in accordance with the approved retrieval 
specific ation.  
b) User records: This functionality allows OEAU personnel, using 
specific computers within the OEAU, to create user records, 
enter user information into the PII database, and establish 
user web accounts in the separate user database. Allows the 
mana gement of users and their dat a, including the ability to 
update a participant’s preferred contact method, address, and 
participation  status ( e.g., no longer wishes to be contacted 
with respect to the PRO component of the study).  
c) Information: This functio nality allows the OEAU to rec ord all 
participant contact, document any changes to the participant, 
and make any important notes rel ated to the participant. Note 
that a paper based patient contact form will require completion 
by the patient. Site staff will  need to fax the patient cont act 
forms to the OEAU office. See section 11.2.  
d) Transactions: SECURIT provides a reporting and moni toring 
interface to the PRO database, which is used to store non -PII 
patient reported survey responses.  
i) Allows OEAU to mon itor per patient form complet ion status 
using the tracking management facility. This facility reports 
on what data is currently exp ected from participants, 
CRAs, and the OEAU interviewers.  
ii) Aggregate reporting: this series of reports allows the 
OEAU to monitor the distribution of p atients over data 
completion methods and form completion methods (both 
overall and by site).  
2. Database utility and control environment (PRO -DUCE): This 
utility interfaces with the main clinical database containing 
CRF/trigger  data (Medidata RAVE), monitors the clinical 
database for events (eg., participant registrations, scheduled 
procedures, and other trig gers) and establishes event 
scheduling. The system sets up e -mail reminders to CRAs, 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
31 participants [and SMS text message re minders, when 
applicable to the study], and OEAU personnel to ensure timely 
completion of surveys.  
3. Web entry systems (PROWESs): a Web site where 
participants complete online surveys  
a) PROWESs provides a front facing web portal for 
participants to complete questionnaires and have those 
results stored in the PRO database.  
b) Secure site using HTTPS an d requiring a username and 
password lo gin. 
c) On login, user is presented with brief instructions; including 
approx. time for completion, number of questions to be 
completed in this session, a ny important information 
regarding this survey (including help a nd contact 
information)  
d) PROWESs is a one -way interface,  data cannot be returned 
from the PRO -DB to the user.  
4. Valet Interface and data entry system (PROVIDES).  
a) The PROVIDES system is a we b interface that allows site 
CRAs to act as a valet and enter  a participant’s responses 
to a survey in to the PRO database should the survey be 
completed on paper. This allows Site CRAs to enter forms 
completed by the patient on site.  
b) Secure site using H TTPS and requiring a username and 
password login.  
c) Which fo rms can be entered is restricted by usern ame, site 
affiliation, and role, thus Sites RAs can only enter surveys 
predesignated as on -site data collection surveys and only 
for their own patients.  
d) On login, user is presented with brief instructions; is 
requested to select the protocol, case numbe r, timepoint 
and verify the case Id by providing the participant 
birthdate.  
e) PROVIDES is a one -way interface, data cannot be 
returned from the PRO -DB to  the user.  
4.7.6  REDCap System to be used for Site Staff Surveys  
The site staff roster and survey data colle cted for this study will be 
managed through REDCap (Research Ele ctronic Data Capture). 
REDCap is a free, secure, web -based application designed to support  
data collection and storage for research studies. REDCap is fully 
compliant with HIPPA regulations. R EDCap is a tool for the creation of 
customized, secure data mana gement systems including web -based 
data entry forms, reporting tools, and a full array of security features 
including user and group based privileges with a full audit trail of data 
manipulati on and export procedures. More specifically, REDCap will 
be used  to distribute and collect the  roster,  baseline, 12 -month follow -
up, and 36-month foll ow-up NCORP site staff surveys.  For this study, 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
32 the REDCap data management software system will be support ed by 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). REDCap is 
maintained on MSKCC -owned servers that are kept in a locked server 
room with appropriate e nvironmental modifications (e.g. proper 
ventilation, power redundancy and fault tolerance arrangement)  and 
backed up nightly with some back -up tapes stored off -site. The 
MSKCC Information Systems group is responsible for applying all 
operating system patch es and security updates to the REDCap 
servers. All connections to REDCap utilize encrypted (SSL -based)  
connections. Nationally, the REDCap software is developed, 
enha nced, and supported through a multi -institutional consortium led 
by Vanderbilt University . 
4.7.7  Qualitative  Data  
Focus Groups: This data will be stored using qualitative database 
software (NVivo) located on the MSKCC secure file network.  
Patient Exit Interviews: This data will be stored using qualitative 
database software (NVivo) located on the MGH secure file networ k. 
4.8 Instructions for Patients who Do Not Complete Baseline Survey and/or Do Not 
Start Assigned Study Inte rvention  
If a patient is registered to Step 1 and does not compl ete the baseline survey 
within 30 days , the patient is considered off study and no additio nal data will be 
requested and patients will not be available to register to Rand omization (Step 
2). Rev. Add 4 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
33 5. Methodology  
5.1 Recruitment and Accrual  
Participants will be recrui ted from NCORP Community and Minority/Underserved 
sites.  
Screening may occur in accordance  with local site policies and procedures. 
NCORP site staff may determine the foll owing criteria by scr eening new patient 
lists/schedules, medical record reviews, or b y approaching patients in clinic or via 
phone. Sites will provide weekly number totals (vi a a distributed REDCap survey) 
of smokers seen at this subcomponent site, patient s ineligible (and rea son), 
smokers approached to participate, and patients refused (a nd reason).  
For potentially eligible  patients, the site staff will also verbally confirm  the 
following additional criteria  (as it is less readily -discernable from chart re view) , 
via phone or i n clinic (in accordance with local site policies and procedures) : 
• ECOG performance status (ineligible if 3 or above; eligible if 2 or below or no 
ECOG lis ted) 
• Cancer diagnosis (type; i.e., lung) and date (subject step 0 registration mu st 
be within 124 days  of diagnosis date)  
• Age (must be 18 years or older)  
• Language (must be English or  Spanish speaking)  
• Confirm they have s moked, even a puff, of a cigarette i n the last 30 days  
• Confirm they intend to receive  their cancer care or monitoring  at NCORP site 
(not a  one-time consult or second -opinion)  
• Conf irm they have telephone, e -mail access, and have access to the internet 
with a camera -enabled device (e.g., sma rtphone, tablet, computer, laptop 
with a webcam/camera).  
The recommended process i s as follows: Site s taff to review new patient list or 
schedules, particularly the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients with 
upcoming visits to identify all patients who are identified as current smokers. This 
list can either be created using an au tomated report with information obtained 
from the relevant EMR fields (e.g., tobacco use) or manually by site staff. It is 
recommended that this list  of potentially eligible patients be generated at least on 
a weekly basis. If information on the smoking st atus of patients is either missing 
or unknown, site staff should ask the patient about their current smoking status 
and update their record. The tota l count of current smoker s onsite should be 
documented in the MSK REDCap Survey.  
EMRs of current smokers sh ould be reviewed for  patients who are adult (≥ 18 
years) and newly dia gnosed (within past 4 months). Site staff should then 
approach these patients t o confirm smoking status,  receipt of care at the NCORP 
site, and email/web access, as well as any above -listed criteria that we re unable 
to be discerned from chart review.  
Only patients who are still eligible after this initial chart review step should be 
approached about the stud y. For patients who are deemed ineligible, or whom 
refuse to be fully screened upo n approach, during t his screening process, site 
staff will document reasons in the MSK REDCap Survey (see Section 5.1.1 ). Rev. Add2

34 For pat ients who meet study criteria, the site staff will ask the patient if it is okay 
for central coordinat ing study staff to contact them with a brief, informational 
video about the study . Verbal permission may occur per sites usual pr actice (via 
telephone or in clinic). For patients who refuse, reasons  for refusal  will be 
documented and tr acked in the  study s pecific  enrollment log. Patients who agree 
to be contacted about the study will be registered in OPEN (Screening Step 0). 
Patient  contact information  and screening characteristics (criteria collected 
above) will be entered  into OPEN.  Once a Patient’s infor mation is in OPEN, the 
virtual clinician referral (informational video) will be sent to the email address 
provided by EASEE PRO. It is highly recommended that site staff have an 
interested and eligible participant view the video at the time of visit and th en also 
obtain written consent (OPEN Step 1).  
Participants may choose to wait to sign consent, but give verbal consent to view 
the outreach recruitment vi deo. Site staff will then follow -up with all patients who 
received a virtual clini cian referral to ass ess their interest in participating in the 
study. Additionally, EASEE -PRO will prompt site staff when a patient has 
watched the v irtual clinician referral  video, to help facilitate recruitment efforts. 
Follow -up attempts may occur at up coming clinic visits  or via phone. It is 
recommended site staff make at least 3 outreach attempts (e.g., approaches in 
clinic, or voicemails), unless  a refusal or enrollment decision is received first. For 
those who refuse or are ineligible for the study, reasons will be docu mented in 
RAVE and ongoing secure data transfers will be sent to MGH. Otherwise, 
interested, eligible patients will be given an i nformed consent form to r eview and 
sign, and will be consented to the study by the NCORP site staff.  
Once a  patient has signed written consent, they will be registered to OPEN Step 
1 of the study and be prompted to complete the Baseline Survey in EASEE -PRO . 
After completion of the  Baseline Survey, the patient will then be eligible to 
register to OPEN Step 2 of the study, which wil l randomize them to a treatment 
arm. Following OPEN Step 2, NCORP site staff  will send patient contact 
information, study ID, dat es of consent and randomi zation, provider information, 
and randomization arm assignment to MGH centralized study staff via the site’s 
Enrollment Log REDCap project . MGH site staff will then email participants’ 
provider an email notification of enrollment i n the study.  
5.1.1  Screening P rocedure and Log  
All smokers on new patient lists or schedules should be screened.  
Inclusion criteria are: 
• Age >18  
• Diagnosed within the past 124 days (Note: patient must  still be in 
the 124 day window at step 0 registration.)  
• Primary language English or Sp anish  
• ECOG performance score < 3  
Patients who meet inclusion criter ia are approach ed directly to confirm 
eligibili ty. To be eligible patients must:  
• have smoked a cigarette in the past 30 days,  
• plan to receive care at the site, and  
• have telephone, e -mail access, and h ave access to the internet 
with a camera -enabled device (e.g., smartph one, tablet, computer, Rev. Add2  
Rev. Add 3 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
35 laptop wi th a webcam/camera).  Sites will provid e the cumulative 
total number of smokers seen at their site, the number of smokers 
approached, number of patients who  are ineligible and refuse, and 
reasons for ineligibility and refusal . These totals will be provided to 
the MSK coordinating center via a R EDCap survey.  
Eligible  patients are asked for consent to be contacted about the 
study. Those consenting are entered i n OPEN and their OPEN ID is 
recorded. If the patient refuses to be co ntacted, the reason for refusal 
is record ed. 
For patients who are eligible and provide written consent (OPEN Ste p 
1), the site staff will enter  sociodemographic, clinical, and contact dat a 
into their site specific REDCap  Project Enrollment Log.  
The data wi ll be securely exported from RED Cap and a ssessed for 
completeness at the DCC on an ongoing basis.  Complete screens will 
be stored in the study database at the  DCC.  DCC staff will provide 
feedback to the site contact about any data quality issues v ia 
passwo rd-protected emails. The timing and frequ ency of the data 
exports will be coordinated between the site and DCC staff.  
5.1.2  Accrual Target  
Sites participating in this trial should anticipate an  accrual goal (i.e., 
patients who complete the baseline survey) of 25  cases per 
subcomponent site. In  recognit ion of variability of patient flow across 
NCORPS, please contact the MGH Coordinating Center to discuss 
more feasible recruitment targets.  
5.1.3  Brief Video Development  
The original template script will be developed by t he study 
investigative team and vetted by  ECOG -ACRIN NCORP PI advisory 
committee chair. This approved script will be disseminated to 
participating sites. Sites will follow the brief video  instructions on how 
to record and upload the video to the online stu dy account. Final 
approval of th e brief video will be conducted by Drs. Park, Ostroff, and 
Wagner. The approved video will be uploaded to the site’s study 
account. The video will then be sent to the patient via the site’s patient 
portal.  
5.2 Enhanced Usual Car e (EUC) (Arm A)  
The EUC reflects  the NCCN  Smoking Cessation Guideline recommendations2 
and mirrors what is often delivered at cancer centers and community settings: 
assessment of smoking status, provision of quitting advice, and referral to the 
national NC I Smokers’ Q uitline for free cou nseling . Some participating NCORP 
community sites might provide additional tobacco treatment, which we will 
assess and document as well.  
All participants r andomized to EUC will have received the assessment of 
smoking status and provision of quitting advice  through the screening and 
recruitment ( virtual clinician referral ) process, and will additionally be referred to 
the NCI Smoking Quitline (smokefree.gov).  Referrals will be sent via email by 
EASEE PRO automatically upon ran domization t o the EUC arm see Rev. Add2  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
36 supplementa l Appendix P). Referrals will also be sent via mailed letter (see EUC 
Referral Letter Supplemental Appendix Z1A) by the MGH study staff to the 
address provided by EUC participants.  
On an ongoing basis, the NCI Quitl ine will provide reports on part icipant 
engagement (date and duration of Quitline call) with quitline services. This 
interaction will be documented in Rave.  
5.3 Virtual Intervention Treatment  (VIT) (Arm B)  
The VIT group will be offered  up to 11 counseling sess ions over  approximately  6 
months  (approxi mate schedule: 4 weekly sessions through week 4; 4 biweekly 
sessions through week 12; and 3 monthly sessions through week 24) and up to 
12 weeks o f free FDA -approved combination NRT (patch and lozenge combined, 
or may elect to receive either optio n alone) . 
VIT participants will receive their 11 counseling sessions via MGH TeleHealth, 
which connects providers to patients through virtual HIPAA -compli ant 
videoconferencing technology including: phone, video, email, m obile applications 
and remote monit oring. These virtual visits are conducted via a videoconference 
platform that addresses clinical privacy and security (e.g., Zoom, Doximity, or 
other HIPPA -compliant platform). Participants can use this videoconference 
platform on their computer, tablet or  smartphone. The counseling will be 
delivered by a study -designated tobacco treatment coach based at MGH. Since 
the counseling takes place virtually, parti cipants will be emailed handouts that 
are traditionally provided a s hardcopies in person. These hando uts, distributed at 
the end of Session 1, include a pill diary, 11 Reasons for Cancer Patients to Quit 
Smoking, and Health Benefits When You Quit Smoking.  
5.3.1  Terminology  
Counseling structure and content: The initial session wil l last 
approximately 40 minutes;  follow -up sessions will last approximately 
15 minutes.  
All counseling sessions will be structured in a 5 As, patient -centered 
format16 and will include  a variety of psycho -educational topics (see 
Table below).

During the initial session, the tobacco counselor:  
1. introduces the study and provides an overview of the goals and 
structur e of the program;  
2. gathers a comprehensive smoking history;  
3. asse sses participants’ concerns abou t smoking;  
4. offers a personalized message to quit smoking;  
5. assess participants’ importance and confidence to quit and pros 
and cons for quitting and c ontinuing to smoke; and  
6. evaluates participants’ readiness to quit.  
The tobacco counselor tailors p articipants’ quit plan based on their 
quit stage, which falls into one of 3 branching logics:  
1. not ready to quit or make changes;  
2. not ready to quit, b ut ready to make changes; and  
3. ready to quit.  
The tobacco counselor  assists the participant in setting a goal for the 
week and schedules a follow -up session for the next week. 
Participants then receive 3 weekly sessions, 4 biweekly sessions, and 
3 monthl y (booster) sessions. The str ucture of each follow -up 
treatment sessi on mirrors the initial weekly se ssions, wherein the 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
38 tobacco counselor assesses quit progress a nd cancer care treatment, 
examines importance and confidence to quit, monitors and intervenes  
on medication use, and tailors quit advice and strategies based on 
participants’ quit readiness; how ever, each session also introduces 
novel topics identified to be relevant concerns among cancer patients 
who are trying to quit  
5.3.2  Provision of medication: Ni cotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)  
At the initial counseling session, t he tobacco counselor will discus s 
use of NRT. Using a decision tree (see Appendix VII  and Appendix 
VIII) the tobacco counselor will review contraindications of the patch 
and l ozenge. The lead CRA and oncolog y clinicians will be informed, 
via password protected emails s ent by the tobacco counselor, that 
over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy (patch/lozen ge) 
medication was dispensed as a means of collaborative care; this i s 
the standard of care for nicot ine replacement therapy. This method 
was reviewed by the ECOG -ACRIN regulatory officer and MGH IRB 
and it was determined that oncology clinician notificati on prior to 
treatment was not needed. The coordinating site staff  will inform the 
NCORP oncology prov ider of the NRT assignment and participants 
will be offered an  initial 4 -week supply of nicotine replacement 
patches and lozenges. Although use of  medicati on will be promoted, it 
is not required for study participation. Medi cation will be administered 
acco rding to the USPHS guidelines16. Two 4 -week refills will be 
discussed with the patient and dispensed accordingly. Side effects will 
be monitored and discus sed weekly with the MPIs. Treating clinicians 
will be contacted for N RT-related questions/concerns. T he tobacco 
counselor will adjust the NRT dose to control withd rawal symptoms 
and minimize adverse effects. NRT will be  housed at the MGH and  
mailed to part icipants  by MGH study staff . NRT has been safely 
distributed through quit lines in this way. 85, 127 NRT kits will include 
instruction and patient information shee ts in English and Spanish 
written for a 6th grade reading level. Use of NRT will be supported  
during each session.  
5.4 Patient Assessments (Arms A & B)  
Patients assig ned to both arms will complete s urveys in the EASEE -PRO system 
at the following time points:  
• Baseline (Supplemental Appendix A)  
• 3 months (Supplemental Appendix B)  
• 6 months (Supplemental A ppendix C)  
The baseline survey (Supplemental Appendix A) should take  approximately 20 
minutes to com plete. The 3 month (Supplemental Appendix B) and 6 month 
(Supp lemental Appendix C) survey should each take approximately 15 minutes 
to complete.  While the preferred method of follow -up data collection is 
participants complet ing the surveys through the EASE E-PRO system, study staff 
may contact participants to assist w ith data collection over the telephone. If the 
study participant prefers a paper copy of the survey, study staff may mail 
participants surveys to be completed and  returned.  Rev. Add3

39 5.5 Adverse Event Report ing Requirements  
All adverse event grades described throughout  this protocol and all 
reportable adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common 
Terminol ogy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  
All appropriate treatment areas should have acce ss to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE ver sion 5.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
5.5.1  Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are a 
required part of every clinical trial, are done so investigators and 
regulatory agencies can detect and analyze adverse events and risk 
situations to ensure the saf ety of the patients enrolled, as well as 
those who will enroll in fut ure studies using similar agents .  
5.5.2  Terminology  
• Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurr ence 
asso ciated with the use of an agent  in humans [(in this protocol 
Nicotine Replacement Th erapy (NRT)], whether or not considered 
agent  related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY  unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symp tom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not con sidered related to the 
medicinal product.  
• Attribution:  An assessment of the relationship between the 
adverse event and the protocol agent (NRT), using the followin g 
categories.  
ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT  related  to the Nicotin e 
Replacement Therapy (NRT)  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  to the Nicotine 
Replacement Therap y (NRT)  
Possible  The AE may be related  to the Nicotine 
Replac ement Therapy (NRT)  
Probable  The AE is likely related  to the Nicotine 
Replacement Therapy (N RT). 
Definite  The AE is clearly related  to the Nicotine 
Replacement Therapy (NRT)  
• CTCAE:  The NCI Co mmon Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events provides a descri ptive terminology that is to be utilized for 
AE reporting. A grade (severity) is provided for  each AE term.  
• Expectedness:  Expected events are those that have been  
previously identified as result ing from administration of the agent 
(NRT). An adverse event i s considered unexpected, for expedited 
reporting purposes, when either the type of event or t he severity of 
the event is NOT listed in  the protocol (please refer to Section 8) 
or drug package insert.  Rev. Add2  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
40 5.5.3  Expedited Ad verse Event Reporting Procedure  
Adverse events requiring expedited reporting will use CTEP’s Adverse 
Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS). CTEP’s guidelines for CTE P-
AERS can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov .   
A CTE P-AERS report must be submitted electronically via the CTEP -
AERS Web -based application locate d at http://ctep.cancer.gov , so 
that ECOG -ACRIN and all appro priate regulatory agencies will be 
notified of the event in an  expeditious manner.  
In the rare event when Internet connectivity is disrupted a 24 -hour 
notification is to be made by telephone to  
• the AE Team at ECOG -ACRIN (85 7-504-2900)  
• the FDA (1 -800-FDA-1088) 
For this study, an electronic report MUST be submitted vi a CTEP -
AERS immediately upon re -establishment of internet connection.  
Supporting and follow u p data: Any supporting or follow up 
documentation must be uploaded to  the Supplemental Data Folder in  
Medidata Rave within 48 -72 hours. In addition, supporting or follow up 
documentation must be faxed to the FDA (800 -332-0178) in the same 
timeframe.  
CTEP T echnical Help Desk:  For any technical questions or system 
problems re garding the use of the CTEP -AERS  application, please 
contact the NCI Technical Help Desk at ncictephelp@ctep.nci.nih.gov  
or by phone a t 1-888-283-7457.  
Many factors determine the requirements for expedit ed reporting of 
adverse event s on each individual protocol. The instructions and 
tables in the  following sections have been customized for protocol 
EAQ171CD and outline the specific exped ited adverse event reporting 
requirements for study EAQ171CD.

a A death while on study treatment (NRT) or within 30 days of the last dose of NRT requires both 
routine and expedited reporting, regardless of causality . Attribution to NRT or other cause must 
be provided.  
NOTE:  A death due to progressive disea se of the patient’s cancer should be reported as a 
Grade 5 “ Disease progression ” under the System Organ Class (SOC) “ General disorder 
and administration site con ditions ”. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underl ying disease (e.g. radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: 
clinical deteriorati on associated with a disease process) should be included within the 
CTEP -AERs report.  
NOTE:  Any death that occurs > 30 days after the last dose of NRT and i s attributed 
possibly, probably,  or definitely to the NRT must be reported within 7 calendar 
days of  learning of the event .   
b Protocol -specific expedited reporting requirements: The adverse e vents listed below also require 
expedited reporting for this tr ial: 
Serious Events:  Any event f ollowing treatment that results in persistent or significant 
disabil ities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or birth defects  must be 
reported in CTEP -AERS with in 7 calendar days of learning of the event. For 
instructions o n how to specifically report the se events, please contact the 
AEMD Help Desk at aemd@tech -res.com  or 301 -897-7497. This will need to 
be discussed on a c ase-by-case basis.  
5.5.6  Other recipients of adverse event reports a nd supplemental data  
Adverse eve nts determined to require expedited reporting must also 
be reported by the institution, according to the local policy and 
procedures, to the Institutional Review  Board responsible for oversight 
of the patient.  
5.6 Duration of In tervention  
Patients assigned to Arm B will receive up to 12 weeks of NRT. NRT will be 
dispensed in 4 -week increments.  
Patients assigned to Arm B will receive counseling for approximately 6 mont hs. 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD

44 6. Measurement of Effect  
6.1 Biochemical S amples  
6.1.1  Primar y effectiveness outcome  
The primary outcome is 7 -day point -prevalence tobacco abstinence at 
6-months follow -up, confirmed biochemically by saliva cotinine or 
expir ed air CO. Point -prevalence is biochemically verifiable and highly 
correlated with continuous  and sustained abstinence.168 
6.1.2  Secondary effectiveness outcome  
7-day point -prevalence tobacco ab stinence at 3 -months follow -up is a 
secondary effectiveness outcome , confirmed biochemically by saliva 
cotinine or expired air CO . Point -prevalence is biochemica lly verifiable 
and highly correlated with continuous and sustai ned abstinence.168 
6.1.3  Definition of  biochemically -confirmed quit  
6.1.3.1  Saliva samples  
Saliva samples will be collected from  all subjects who 
report being quit at 3 - and/or 6 -month follow -up who do not  
report concurrent NRT or e -cigarette use.  Saliva samples 
will be  tested for cotinine, which is a  chemical the body 
makes when exposed to nicotine.  
6.1.3.1.1  Saliva cotinine s cores of < 15ng/ml167, 168 will 
be considered biochemically -confirmed quit.  
6.1.3.2  Expired air CO sa mples  
Expired air CO breath tests will be offered to all subjec ts 
who report being quit at 3 - and/or 6 -month follow -up who 
also report concurrent NRT or e -cigarett e use . The expired 
air tests will show carbon monoxide levels in the breath.  
6.1.3.2.1  Expired air CO s amples with a reading of  
< 10ppm168 will be considered 
biochem ically -confirmed quit.  
6.2 Patient a ssessments  
6.2.1  Secondary smoking outcomes  are commonly used in tobacco 
cessation trials and in our previous work.127 Reduction in smoking is 
important as most adult smokers reduce smoking as they try to 
quity206; self -reported s moking status will additionally be used as it has 
been reported that deception of smoking status cla ssification among 
cancer patients is low.207 
6.2.1.1  Self-reported quit status  
Patients will be asked  on the 3 - and 6 -month follow -up 
surveys, how long it has been since they last smoked a 
cigaret te, even one or two puffs. “Current smoker” will be 
defined as smoki ng a cigarette, even one or two puffs, in 
the past 7 days.  (See Supplemental Appendices B: 3 -
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
45 month Survey and C: 6 -month Survey). This will be used to 
gener ate secondary outcomes of self -reported 7 -day point 
prevalence abstinence, continuous and sustained 
abstinence (See Section 2.3 for definitions).  
6.2.1.2  Significant reduction in daily smoking  
Patients will be asked at baseline, 3 -, and 6 -month follow -
ups, in the past 30 days, (1) on how many days they 
smoked cigarett es, and (2) how many cigarettes per day 
they typically smoked. “Significant reduction” will b e 
defined as a > 50% reduction in cigarettes per day from 
basel ine to 3 - and 6 -month follow -ups. (See Supplemental 
Appendix A: Baseline Survey)  
6.2.2  Exploratory objecti ves – Moderators  and Mediators: We will collect 
information on the following baseline factors  and modifiable 
characteristics that may affect the association  between treatment 
group and eff ectiveness outcomes. The following factors have been 
selected from t he theoretical models, the Self -Regulation Model 
(SRM)147,148  and the Health Belief Model (HB M)149, that have informed 
this intervention, as well as based o n our previous research.127 
6.2.2.1  Soci odemographics  
Patients will be asked information about their 
sociode mographic characteristics (i.e., sex, age, marital 
status, race/ethnicity, education level, h ealth insurance) at 
baseline. Financial burden will  be assessed  using 3 items 
from Dr. Park’s n ational health insurance survey.205 
6.2.2.2  Medical history  
Alcohol use   
Patients will be asked about alcohol use using the Alcohol 
Use Disorders Identification Test (A UDIT -C), 194 a three -
item brief screening test for heavy drinki ng or alcohol 
dependence.  
6.2.2.3  Smokin g history  
Patients will be asked information about their smoking 
history (i.e., # of years smoked, daily smoking rate, 24-
hour quit attempts, other tobacco/nicot ine use, current and 
past use of tobacco treatments) using item s adapted from 
the Cancer Patien t Tobacco Use Questionnaire (C -TUQ), 
developed by the NCI -AACR Cance r Patient Tobacco Use 
Assessment Task Force designed to capture information 
about tobacco use  for cancer patients and survivors. 195, 
196Nicotine dependence  will be assessed using the 2 -item 
Heaviness of Smoking Index from the Fagerstrom Test for 
Nicotine Dependence (FTND), which has predictive validity 
with the FTND. 171-173 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
46 6.2.2.4  Quality of life and e motions  
Emotional distress  will be assessed using the NCCN’s 
one-item Distress Thermometer  that asks the respondents 
to rate their current level of distress on a s cale ranging 
from “0” (No distress) to “10” (Extreme distress).174,175 
Coping  will be assesse d using a 1 -item, 10 -point scale 
asking how the subject has bee n able to cope with the 
current stress in their life, ranging from “0” (Not at all able) 
to “10” (Ve ry much able).  
Anxiety  will be assessed using the PROMIS Item Bank 
Emotional Distress -Anxiety -Short Form 4a which was 
developed for the general adult popula tion and which 
evaluates anxiety  symptoms (e.g., “My worries 
overwhelmed me”) over the past 7 days o n a 5 -point Likert 
scale with raw scores ranging from 4 -20. 188, 198 
Depression  will be asses sed using the PROMIS Item Bank 
Emotional Distress -Depression Sh ort Form 4a which was 
developed for the general adult population and which 
evaluates depression symp toms (e.g., “I felt hopeless”) 
over the past 7 -days on a 5 -point Likert scale with raw 
scores  ranging from 4 -20. 188, 198  
If a patient is determined as at acute risk, the study 
investigato rs will reach out to the patient’s oncology team 
immediately to reco mmend a visit to the emergency room . 
The tobacco counselors will be trained to assess suicida lity 
and be supervised by licensed psychologists to assess the 
best real -time approach to the s afety issues that may arise.  
We will include a standard disclaimer a t the end of each 
study survey that stipulates that survey responses are not 
reviewed in real  time. We will also provide guidance for 
individuals who feel t hat they need additional psychos ocial 
support and possibly mental care:  
“We do not review these surv eys in real time.  Many 
individuals in a similar situation may feel distressed , and 
the study investigators  encourage you to speak to your 
cancer care team t o find out about local psychosoc ial 
support services. Your well -being is important to us. The 
Americ an Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS) helpline 
and chat services are available to anyone wh o may need 
psychosocial support for coping with cancer and its 
treatment (1 -866-APOS -4-HELP). I f you are feeling highly 
depressed or anxious, you may call and spea k to a 
professional hotline counselor at 800 -273-8255.”  
6.2.2.5  Cancer beliefs  
Cancer stigma  will be measured using the Internalized 
Stigma and Constrained Disclosu re subscales of the Lung 
Cancer Stigma Inventory (LCSI). These subscales have 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
47 been modified in wordi ng for use in the general cancer 
population. The LCSI has preliminary psychometric 
evidence d emonstrating reliability and validity. 199, 200 Items 
assess to  what degree the subject has exp erienced certain 
situations since their cancer diagnosis (i.e., “I h ave been 
careful who I’ve told about my cancer”), and are scored on 
a 5-point Likert scale ra nging from “Not at all” to 
“Extremely”.  
6.2.2.6  Smoking beliefs  
Quit-smoking medication beliefs  will be  assessed using a 
modified version of the Attitudes about Nicotine 
Replacement Therapy Scale (ANRT -12)201, which asks 
about the subjects’ thoughts on the benefit s of using 
nicotine replacement therapy (i.e., “NRT is easy to use”) on 
a 5-point agreement sca le ranging from “1” (Strongly 
disagree) to “5” (Strongly agree).  
Self-efficacy to quit  and importance of quitting  will be 
assessed using two 1 item, 10 -point mea surements161 
ranging from “0” (Not confident at all; or; Not im portant at 
all) to “10” (Very co nfident; or; Very important).  
Perceived benefits of quitting smoking  will be evaluated 
using 5 questions about the benefits of quitting for 
decreasing risk for s econd primary cancer or recurrence 
and increasing cancer treatm ent efficacy, scored on a 
scale from “0” (Not at all) to “10” (Very much) (i.e., how 
much does quitt ing smoking reduce your chances of 
developing your cancer again?”).87   
Quit-smoking medicati on beliefs  will be assessed using a 
modified version of the Att itudes about Nicotine 
Replacemen t Therapy Scale (ANRT -12)201, which asks 
about the subjects’ thought s on the benefits of using 
nicotine replacement therapy (i.e., “NRT is easy to use”) on 
a 5-point agreement scale ranging from “1” (Strongly 
disagree) to “5 ” (Strongly agree).  
Stigma  will be assessed using a 6 -item scale measuring 
stigma related to being a  smoker, which has been modified 
from a previously used measuring smoking related stigma 
amon g smokers with comorbid behavioral health 
conditions.208 Items ask how strongly subjects agree or 
disagree with statements such as “I have avoided telling 
others t hat I am a smoker” or “I have worried that others 
will view me unfavorably because I am a smo ker”. 
6.2.2.7  Physical symptoms  
Cravings  will be assessed using a singl e item from the 
Mood and Physica l Symptoms Scale (MPSS)202 which 
evaluates urges to smoke over the l ast 24 hours on a scale 
from “0” (Not at all) to “5” (All the time).  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
48 6.2.2.8  Environmental influences  
Level of second -hand smoke exposure  will be assessed by 
evalua ting the number of smokers in th e household and 
existence of a household smoking policy using 2 ques tions 
from the 2008 National Social Climate Survey of Tobacco 
Control.187 
Perceived social su pport  will be assessed using the 
PROMIS Item Bank Emotional Sup port 4a Short Form188 
203 which was developed for the general adult population 
and which evaluates perceived feelings of being cared for 
and valued as a person (e.g., “I have someone who will 
listen to me when I need to talk”) on a 5 -point Likert scale 
ranging from “1” (Never) to “5” (Al ways).  
Perceived provider support  will be assessed using the 
Patient  Reported Oncology Provider 5As Delivery, a 
Yes/No scale asking subjects if their cancer doct or or 
nurse has delivered any of the 5A’s (i.e., “Advised you t o 
quit smoking cigarettes”) in a  recent consult.  204 
6.2.3  Exploratory objectives – implementation outcome s: We will assess 
patient satisfaction with the proposed virtual treatment delivery 
modality and intervention content. Patient feedback will be taken into 
consideration in further refining  of intervention protocols, and is 
important for gathering key infor mation on intervention delivery and 
potential for implementation in real -world situations.  
6.2.3.1  Acceptability  
Satisfaction with various aspects of the tobacco tr eatment 
program will be evaluate d through participant survey 
responses and post -treatment interviews . 
6.2.3.1.1  Surveys  
At the 6 -month survey (Supplemental 
Appendix C), participant satisfaction will be 
assessed using a mixture of multiple -choice 
question items: (1) To what extent has the 
tobacco t reatment program met your 
needs? (2) Did you get the kind of smoking  
cessation assistance that you wanted; (3) 
How helpful was the smoking cessation 
assistance?;  (4) How would you rate the 
quality of the assistance you recei ved? (5) 
Would you recommend thi s program?; as 
well as open -ended free -text items about 
aspects of t he program they found the 
most/least helpful, challenges faced to 
participation, and any reco mmendations for 
additional topics or programs that would 
have i mproved their experience at this  time.

49 6.2.3.1.2  Semi -Structured Individual Patient 
Interviews  
Following completion of their 6 -month 
follow -up surveys, 40 intervention VIT 
participants will be randomly selected 
(based on smoking status) to participate in 
in-depth ex it interviews. Using a semi -
structured interview guide, stu dy staff will 
conduct these virtual interviews. All 
participants will be asked open -ended 
questions about a) program engagement: 
(1) What did you think of the clinician video 
that you received enco uraging you to enroll 
in the stu dy?, (2) reasons for it bei ng helpful 
or not; b) counseling: (1) What counseling 
components/NRT did you find the most 
helpful? Why?; (2) What counseling 
components/NRT did you find the least 
helpful? Why?; c) NRT medication dose and 
access: (1) Please tell  me if you used any 
NRT med ication. How much? How 
difficult/easy was it to access?; d) logistics 
and overall impressions: (1) What were 
some of the challenges you faced to 
participating?, (2) Probe: virtual 
assessments, mail ed NRT, etc.; e) 
videoconferenci ng delivery: (1) Please tel l 
me about your experience connecting with 
your tobacco counselor via a virtual screen. 
What did you like about it? Dislike about it? 
Difficulties to using the program? Benefits to 
using the progra m?; and f) cessation advice 
and assistance received from on cology care 
team.  
6.2.4  Patient Remuneration  
Patient par ticipants will receive $20 in gift cards for each survey 
completed (baseline, 3  months, and 6  months; 3 total possible). 
Subjects who complete a bi ospecimen sample (saliva or CO b reath 
test) will receive $40 in gift cards for each sample completed (3mo., 
and 6mo; 2 total possible). Subjects who are randomly selected for an 
exit interview will be p rovided $20 in gift cards for participation (1 
possibl e). Therefore, subjects have the  opportunity to receive up to 
$160 in remuneration.  (See Supplemental Appendi ces G -M for Patient 
Remuneration Letters). The central coordinating site (i.e., MGH) will 
be responsible for managing the disbursement of gift card s directly to 
participants.  
6.3 NCOR P Site Staff Assessments  
At the practice (organizational) level, little is kn own about the acceptability of 
integrating tobacco treatment delivery into routine oncology c are. In this trial, 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
50 implementation outcomes will be as sessed with mixed methods using qualitative 
(focus group interviews) and quantitative (surveys) data to be co llected from a 
subset of Site PI, CCDR Leader, and other oncology clinicians and research 
administrative staff from each participating NCORP site ( See Section 3.1). As 
shown in the NCORP Site Staff Schema (p 7), surveys will be collected at 
baseline (pre -patient participant enrollment, and then again at approximately 12 
and 36 months following baseline).  
The NCORP Site Staff assessments will be manage d by Dr. Ostroff and her 
study designated research assistant. The baseline, 1 2 and 36 month follow -up 
surveys will be collected using REDCap, (Research Electronic Data Ca pture), a 
data management software syst em supported by the Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center (MSKCC) Information Systems group . 
Staff Survey of Site Character istics, Organizational Readiness and 
Perceived Tobacco Treatment Feasibility, Acceptability a nd 
Appropriateness:  
As described in Sec tion 3.1, the CCDR Leader and site PI from each 
participating NCORP site will i dentify a subset of approximately 10 clinicians 
(nurses, oncologists) and administrative staf f (site coordinators, support staff)] t o 
provide data about the implementation of toba cco use assessment and 
treatment. Data collec tion will include qualitative ( focus group interviews) and 
quantita tive (survey) research methods.  The baseline site staff su rveys will be 
administered prior to the  first site patient enrollment. Post surveys will be 
cond ucted approximately 12 and 36 months post the baseline survey. The group 
interview will be conducted at the 36 -month follow -up as well. (See Supplemental 
Appendices D: Baseline Site Staff Survey, E: 12-month Site Staff Survey, F: 36 -
month Site Staff Survey ). 
The content of the mixed methods data collection will focus on several 
impleme ntation outcomes including Appropriateness, Feasibility, Acceptability, 
and Sustainability. T he focus group interviews  will last for approximately 45 -60 
minutes, and the surveys w ill require approximately 15 minutes for completion. 
Site staff participants will be remunerated $100 incentive in total for completion of 
each wave of pre - and post -trial surveys ($20 per survey ) and focus group 
interview ($40) . 
6.3.1  NCORP Site Characteristics : 
At the time of site registration, the CCDR Lead or their designee(s) 
will complete the site rostering survey. This survey requests that 
applicable CTEP IDs be grouped into larger practice group s with 
shared providers, populations served an d services offe red. For each 
practice group, the CCDR Lead or their designee(s) will complete 
items regarding practice characteristics including safety net 
designation, minority/underserved NCORP status, geogra phic site 
location, practice volume, provider mix and ownersh ip, and tobacco 
cessation services that are available for patients treated at each 
practice group.  
6.3.2  Organizational Readiness for Implementing Tobacco Use Assessment 
and Treatment : 
Organizational r eadiness for the treatment of tobacco use in the 
context of c ancer care and the feasibility of implementing the various Rev. Add 4 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
51 components of the tobacco  treatment interventions (EUC and VIT) will 
be assessed by participating staff pre - and post -trial. Perceptions  of 
site organizational readiness will be measured using the 7-item 
Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC, Shea et 
al 2014) meas ure assessing two subscales, change commitment and 
change efficacy, on a 5 -point ordinal scal e ranging from ‘Ag ree’ to 
‘Disagree’. A total organizational readiness score, a nd subscale 
change commitment and change efficacy score are created.  144,145  
6.3.3  Perceiv ed Tobacco Treatment Feasibility, Acceptability and 
Appropriateness:  
Staff participants will also rate perceive d feasibility, acceptability and 
appropriateness of the vario us tobacco treatment interventions being 
tested in this trial (Weiner et al, 2017) o n a 6 -point ordinal scale 
ranging from ‘Strongly Disagree’ to ‘Strongly Agree’ Aggregate and 
intervention -speci fic summary scores for tobacco treatment feasibility, 
accepta bility and appropriateness are derived. The NCORP Staff 
Survey will take approximate ly 20 minutes to complete and will be 
administered at baseline, defined as after site registr ation and before 
the first patient is registered, and at approximately 12 and 36 months 
after site registration  (See Supplemental Appendices D: Site Staff 
Baseline Survey, E: Si te Staff 12 -month survey and F: Site Staff 36-
month survey) . 
6.3.4  Focus Group Interview  
The focus  group interview will assess implementation processes 
including barriers and fa cilitators for sustaining tobacco treatment as 
routine cancer c are practice in the N CORP site.  The question probes 
for our implementation -focused focus group interviews will be guided 
by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research 
(CFIR)20 and w ill address the 1) the intervention, 2) inner setting, 3) 
outer settings, 4) individ uals involved, and 5) the process for 
sustaining tobacco treatm ent following trial completion . 
The focus group interview will be conducted using videoconference 
software (e .g., Zoom, Doximity, or other HIPPA -compliant platform).  
enabling  audio recording of the focus group interview for subsequent 
coding of primary implementation themes. The focus gro up interviews 
will be scheduled at the convenience of the NCORP staff parti cipants 
and is expected to take about 45 -60 minutes to complete. F ocus 
group interviews will take place at the end of the trial (after patient 
participant enrollment is closed and 36-month follow -up surveys 
completed)  
Focus group Interviews will be recorde d, transc ribed and analyzed 
using NVivo qualitative software. Content analyses will be conducted 
by the two  RAs and overseen by Drs. Park and Ostroff. The coders 
will meet to develo p the thematic fram ework, categories, and coding 
plan. To ensure coding rel iability, coding discrepancies will be 
resolved through discussion and comparison of raw data. Coding will 
continue until a high level of reliability (Kappa= >0.80) is established. 
Drs. Ostroff and Pa rk will provide an expert review of the analyses . Rev. Add2  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
52 The qu alitative and quantitative findings  will provide detailed initial 
data on implementation processes that wil l inform subsequent testing 
of multi -level implementation strategies for b road national 
disse mination into community cancer care settings.  
6.3.5  Monthly Meeting Minutes Data  
We will conduct content analysis of monthly meeting minutes with 
CCDR Leaders and other NCORP site staff to summarize 
engagement of participating sites. We will explore indicators of 
engagement (quantity and quality) by documenting the proportion and 
representativeness of participating stakeholders (Site PIs, CCDR 
leads, oncology nurses) engaged in monthly meetings, how 
(approaches used and level of engagement) an d when (which parts of 
the research process) stakeholders e ngage, and what they did to 
facilitate integration of tobacco assessment and treatment in cancer 
care delivery (strategies for identifying current smokers).  
6.4 Cost 
We w ill assess NCORP staff time re quired to screen all patients for smoking 
status and identify all current smokers. Each CCDR Leader will fill in costs, 
including local staff effort (time x base salary) related to eligibility screening. This 
data will be coll ected via the weekly Patient S creening Log (Appendix Z2D) All 
staff time costs will be estimated based on national average wages by job type.  
Counseling delivery cost s will include the counselor’s time, including efforts to 
contact patients, as well as sup ervisors’ time, all of which w ill be tracked within 
study databases . 
NRT delivery costs will be estimated using national average retail prices. Overall 
costs will be standardized per randomized study participant across sites for the 
cost-effectiveness . 
6.5 Treatment fidelity/adaptations  
We will collect data about EUC fidelity by asking patients at follow -up whether 
they were advised to quit by their oncology providers and  whether they were 
referred to the Quitline or other tobacco cessation counseling services . All trial 
participants will be given a Smokefree Study 2.0 brochure about the NCI Quitline 
providing instructions to c all for tobacco treatment. The MGH Coordinatin g 
Center will be responsible for providing and documenting distribution of the 
Quitline br ochure to all Smokefree Study 2.0 Trial participants. The Quitline call 
center routinely asks participants to identify how they found out about the 
Quitline. For the duration of this trial, the Quitline will record whether callers 
identify the Smokefree St udy as the source of referral.  In addition, the Quitline 
routinely collects limited demographic information, including caller’s telephone 
number, which will serve as the caller identifier allowing us to link the Quitline 
database with Smokefree Study 2.0 p articipants. Twice yearly, the  MGH 
Coordinating Center will send an Excel list of Smokefree Study 2.0 participant 
study IDs with corresponding telephone numbers to th e NCI Quitline Call Center 
requesting lookback for any caller NCI Quitline contact within the past 6 months. 
In other wo rds, a data manager from the NCI Quitline Call Center will review the 
data every 6 months to see if a person who entered the study on Sm okefree has 
also contacted the NCI Quitline. The MGH Coordinating Center will record the Rev. Add2  Rev. Add 3 Rev. Add 4 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
53 date(s) and duration of Quitlin e contact into Smokefree Study 2.0 Access 
database. The NCI Quitline will be listed in the Research Authorization .   
For VIT  interventio n participants, the number  of contacts, session content and 
completion, and NRT dispersal will be documented. For EUC pa rticipants, 
information on the number of  quitline sessions and NRT dispensed will be 
obtained from quitline vendors. MGH research staff  will also record the 
percentage  of virtual clinician referral videos ( brief videos ) opened . Patient 
engagement will be a ssessed by documenting dispensal and patient -reported 
NRT use. All of the treatment fidelity of this data will be monitored by MGH 
resea rch staff and recorded in an Access database (see MGH protocol).  
Following Stirman and col leagues’ recommendations (2013 ),165 we will track any 
intervention  modifications (e.g., counselor adherence to the VIT manual , 
medication changes).  
6.6 Reach and Adoptio n 
Site coordinators will document the percentage of all current smokers who 
participate at  each site. Using a Patient Sc reening Log (Appendix Z2D), we will 
assess the number of eligible patients who were approached and the number of 
eligible patients who e nrolled. Reasons for ineligibility, refusal, and 
characteristics of refusers, ineligibles,  and drop outs will be documen ted. 
Consistent with the hybrid effectiveness implementation trial design, we will 
collect characteristics of ineligibles and refusers t o inform future dissemination 
efforts such that we can evaluate the critical question of w hom we are not 
reaching for to bacco treatment.  
The MGH RA will track uptake and utilization on the sites that are engaged in 
study activities (i.e., participation in monthly calls and patient program 
enrollment).

ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
60 Patient is advised to pick "quit day" and begin using nicotine 
transdermal patches on that day and simultaneo usly stop smoking. 
They may continue to smoke if not immediately able to/willing to stop 
smoking, however every effort should be made to decrease the 
amount smoked while on replacement therapy, as continued smokin g 
can increase adverse effects.  It is impor tant for patients to  complete 
the full program, but some may need to use NRT for longe r periods to 
keep from smoking.  
Apply to clean, dry, non -hairy area of skin (typically upper arm or 
shoulder), bein g sure to rotate sight placed. Do not use the same 
sight for two consecutiv e applications. Try to not repeat any sight 
more than once in a 7 day period.  
Apply new patch upon awakenin g and wear patch for 24 hours. In the 
event patient experiences vivid dreams or insomnia, remove patch 
before bedtime.  
Do not cut  patch, as this will  result in uneven administration of 
medication and can increase risk of adverse e ffects and decrease 
efficacy.  
After removing a patch, fold in half placing the sticky ends together, 
place in its original pouch, and discard out of the re ach of children and 
pets. The patch still contains small amounts of nicotine which are 
poisonous children and pets . 
8.1.5  Availability/How Supplied  
Nicotine transdermal patches are FDA approved for smoking 
cessation aid and are commercially available.  
8.1.6  Side Effec ts 
There are no sign ificant safety concerns associated with using more 
than 1 over -the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) 
simultaneously or at same time as another nicotine -containing product 
(including cigarettes), however the potential for nicotine overdose is  
increased if patient continues to smoke.  Every effort should be made 
to decrease the number of cigarettes smoked to zero while using 
replacement therapy.  
Below are the most commonly reported adverse events related to 
nicotine transderm al patch. Please ref er to the package 
insert/investigator’s brochure for the comprehensive list of adverse 
events.  
Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
diarrhea), headache, insomnia, vivid dreams, and applicat ion site 
irritation.  
Contact your doctor if  you experience these side effects and they are 
severe or bothersome.  
The incidence of developing dependence on nicotine replacemen t is 
considered to be very low.  Smokers may worry that they will become 
dependent on nicotine replacement , but nicotine depen dence rarely 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
61 occurs. Nicotine replacement therapy has not been shown to increase 
or cause development of cancer.  
Use of nicotine transdermal patches may not be appropriate in the 
following populations and should be carefully monitored b y a 
physician  
• non-smokers, occasional smokers, and children under 18 years of 
age (see Warnings),  
• known hypersensitivity of the skin, allergy to nicotine or any patch 
components,  
• generalized skin disorders,  
• recovery phase of acute myocardial infarction, un stable or 
worsening angina pectoris, severe cardiac arrhythmias, and 
recent cerebrovascular accident.  
Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:  
Transdermal nicotine is considered US FDA Category D. The adverse 
effects on fetal and maternal health caused by cigarette sm oking are 
clearly es tablished. Nicotine freely passes into the placenta and is 
found in both amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood (Luck & Nau, 
1984; Hibberd et al, 1978). Nicotine is readily transferred to the fetus 
throughout pregnancy; the fetus is ac tually exposed to hi gher nicotine 
concentrations than the mother (Luck et al, 1985). The use of 
cigarettes or nicotine gum during the third trimester of pregnancy has 
been associated with diminished breathing movement in the fetus. 
There are no conclusive data to support diff erent pregnancy 
categories for the various nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) 
products (Lyman & Raebel, 2001).  
If you are pregnant or breast -feeding, only use this medicine on the 
advice of your health care provider. Smoking can serious ly harm your 
child. Try to stop smoking without using any nicotine replacement 
medicine. This medicine is believed to be safer than smoking. 
However, the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully 
known."  
8.1.7  Potential Interactions  
There is increased  risk of nicotine ov erdose in patients who continue 
smoking while using a nicotine replacement therapy, or those utilizing 
more than one form of  nicotine replacement therapy. Caution should 
be used to prevent overdose, and smoking should be completely 
discontinued while using  therapy.  
Signs and symptoms of nicotine overdose may include:  
abdominal or stomach pain, cold sweat, confusion, convulsions 
(seizures), disturbed hearing and vision, drooling, extreme 
exhaustion, pale skin, rapid heartbeat, an d tremors . Contact your 
docto r if you experience any of these symptoms .

waking up.  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
63 Smokers who smoke first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up:  
• Use one 4 -mg lozenge every 1 to 2 hours for weeks 1 to 6, 
followed by one 4 -mg lozenge every 2 to 4 hours for weeks 7 to 9, 
then one 4 -mg lozenge every 4 to 8 hours for weeks 10 t o 12.  
Smokers who smoke their first cigarette > 30 minutes after waking up:  
• Use one 2 -mg lozenge every 1 to 2 hours for weeks 1 to 6, 
followed by one 2 -mg lozenge every 2 to 4 hours for weeks 7 to 9, 
then one 2 -mg lozenge every 4 to 8 h ours for weeks 10 to  12. 
Patient is advised to pick "quit day" and begin using nicotine polacrilex 
lozenge on that day an d simultaneously stop smoking. They may 
continue to smoke if not immediately able to/willing to stop smoking, 
however every effort shou ld be made to decrea se the amount smoked 
while on replacement therapy, as continued smoking  can increase 
adverse effects. It is important for patients to complete the full 
program, but some may need to use NRT for longer periods to keep 
from smoking.  
Place  the lozenge in your  mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly 
dissolve (20 - 30 minutes). Avoid chewing or swallowing the lozenge. 
Patients should also avoid eating or drinking 15 minutes before using 
or while the lozenge is in your mouth.  
Patients may experi ence a tingling sens ation in their mouth when 
using the lozenge. While using the lozenge occasionally move the 
lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely 
dissolved.  
To improve your chances of quitting, use at least 9 lozenges per day  
for the first 6 wee ks 
Avoid using more than one lozenge at a time or continuously use one 
lozenge after another since this may cause hiccups, heartburn, 
nausea or other side effects. Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 
hours or 20 lozenges per day.  
8.2.5  Avail ability/How Supplied  
Nicotine polacrilex lozenges are FDA approved for smoking cessation 
aid and are commercially available.  
Product is supplied as a 2 mg or 4 mg oral lozenge or troche.

66 9. Statistical Consideration s 
9.1 Estimated Effect S ize 
Based on our current trial preliminary findings (Preliminary Studies) and previous 
trial with low SES smokers, 85 we conservatively estimate 7 -day point -prevalence 
tobacco abstinence at 6 -month follow -up will be 1 5% for the standard  care group 
and 3 2% for the intervention group. This estimate is based on our current trial, 
which has a higher intensity control group.  
9.2 Power calculation:  
9.2.1  Aim 1. Primary effectiveness outcome.  
The study will have 80% power to detect a 17% difference in 7 -day 
point -prevalence  tobacco abstinence with a two -sided significance 
level of 0.01 with 280 participants.

9.3 Estimate of drop -outs/loss to follow -up: 
We estimate that 10% of participants will die within 6 -months of enrollment , so an 
additional 10% (n= 28) will be recruited.   
9.4 Total Sample size:  
308 patient  participants . 
9.5 Plans for handling missing data:  
At the outset, we will examine the frequency distributions of all variables. Data 
from all sites will be pooled for analysis, after confirming there is no significant 
heterogen eity among  sites or adjusting as needed. We will compare the baseline 
characteristics  to assess whether randomization distributed covariates evenly. 
Outcome analyses will be intent -to-treat; we will classify participants who are lost 
to follow -up and those  who do not provide a saliva or an expired air sample as 
current smokers. We will det ermine whether there is differential dropout in the 
groups and consider developing probability -of-completion weights189 to obtain 
unbiased  estimates of treatment effect.  We will assess whether data are missing 
at random. We will perform sensitivity analysi s using: 1) a complete case 
analysis and 2) multiple imputation for missing data.190 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
68 9.6 Plans for analyzing the primary objectives: treatment effectiveness (Aim 1)  
The primar y objective is to compare the proportions of participants in the study 
arms with 7 -day point -prevalence abstinence from cigarettes at 6 -months post 
enrollment. We will define 7 -day point -prevalence by saliva cotinine (< 15 ng/ml) 
or expired air CO (<10 ppm ). All participants who report being quit and no NRT or 
e-cigarette use will be reque sted to provide saliva samples, expired air CO will be 
measured in participants who report being quit and report concurrent NRT or e -
cigarette use . If a participant is los t to follow -up or does not provide a saliva or 
CO sample, they will be considered a c urrent smoker. The primary analysis will 
be performed from an intent -to-treat perspective. Chi -square tests will be used to 
compare the outcomes between treatment groups. Outcomes will be considered 
different with p<0.01 . 
As a randomized study, it is hoped  that the two groups will be balanced between 
potential confounders. Appropriate comparisons between the groups will be 
performed (chi -squared tests, t -tests, etc.) to ide ntify any potential confo unders 
that were not balanced. If significant areas of imbal ance are identified, logistic 
regression modelling will be performed to adjust for potential confounding.  
9.7 Plans for analyzing the secondary objectives: secondary treatment  effectiveness 
(Aim 1)  
The 5 secondary  objectives (defined in Section 2.3) include various  ways of 
measuring abstinence at different times of assessment.  In order to adjust for 
multiple comparisons, differences will be considered significant at 
0.01/N=0.01/5=0.002 level . 
Similar to the primary o bjective is to compare the proportions of participants in 
the study arms with 7 -day point -prevalence abstinence from cigarette s at 3 -
months post enrollment. We will define  7-day point -prevalence by saliva cotinine 
(< 15 ng/ml) or expired air CO (<  10 ppm).  All participants who report being quit 
and no NRT or e -cigarette use will be requested to provide saliva samples, 
expired air CO will be measured in participants who repo rt being quit and report 
concurrent NRT or e -cigarette use. If a participant is lost to follow -up or does not 
provide a saliva or CO sample, they will b e considered a current smoker.  Chi-
square tests will be used to compare the outcomes between treatment g roups.  
Another secondary objective is to compare the proportions of participants in t he 
study arms that self -report cig arette abstinence at 3 -months. The participant will 
be asked, “In the past 7 days, have you smoked a cigarette, even a puff.” With 
the an swer recorded as “Yes” or “No”. If the self -report response is unavailable, 
the parti cipant will b e considered a current smoker. Chi-square tests will be used 
to compare the outcom es between treatment groups. The process will be 
repeated using self -reporte d cigarette abstinence at 6 -months.  
Another secondary objective is to compare the pro portions of participants in the 
study arms that report a continuous abstinence at 6 months. The participants will 
be asked, “ How long has it been since  you last smoked a c igarette (even one or 
two puffs)?”  at 6 months.  If the response is more than  or equal  to 3 months  (e.g. 
time since previous survey) , the participant will be considered having a 
continuous abstinence at 6 months.  If the self -report response is unavailable, the 
participant will be considered not having a continuous abstinence at 6 months.  
Chi-square tests will be used to compare the outc omes between treatment 
groups . 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
69 Another secondary objective is to compare the proportions of participants with 
sustained abst inence  at 6 months . To qualify as a sustained abstinence at 6  
months, the participant  must qualify as biochemically -verified 7 -day point 
prevalence cigarette abstinence at 3 and 6 mont hs, using the definition above.  If 
either measure is not available the p articipant will not  be considered sustained 
abstinence at 6 months . Chi-square tests will be used to compare the out comes 
between treatment groups.  
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach will be used to study the 
treatment effect over time, incorp orating 3 & 6 month follow -up data. This will 
take into account the repeated measures  structure of observations within the 
same individuals over time and allow for analysis of incomplete data across time.  
9.8 Plans for analyzing the exploratory objectives:  
9.8.1  Aim 2: To assess the potential effect of known and potential 
moderators on treatment eff ectiveness between the two arms.  
We will export the moderator effects on treatment effectiveness.  
There are 2 outcomes collected at 2 time points  and 2 outcomes at 1 
time point : 
• Biochemically -verified 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 3 - and 
6-months fo llow-up 
• Self-reported cigarette abstinence at 3 - and 6 -months follow -up 
• Continuous abstinence at 6 months (no self -reported smoking 
since last survey point)  
• Sustained abst inence at 6 months (biochemically -verified 
abstinence at 3 and 6 months)  
The moderato rs of primary interest are:  
• Sociodemographics: Sex, age, marital status, race/ethnicity, 
education level, financial burden , health insurance, internet and 
smartphone acces s and modality  
• Smoking history: Years smoked, daily smoking rate, other 
tobacco/nicot ine use (e.g., cigars, cigarettes), current/past use of 
tobacco treatments, nicotine dependence (2 -item “Heaviness of 
Smoking Index” from the FTND)  
• Cancer variables: Cance r type, cancer stage, treatment, and days 
since diagnosis  
• Site characteristics:  
• Site, geographic location, clinic volume,  
• baseline organizational readiness (9 -item survey for readiness 
to implement NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation using 
Weiner’s Organ izational Readiness for Implementing Change 
(ORIC) survey144,145) 
• site usual care (re corded on the 2017 landscape survey)  
Additional moderators to be explored:  
• Medical history: ECOG Performance Status, alcohol use (3 items 
form the AUDIT -C) 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
70 • Quality of life /emotions: Emotional distress, coping, anxiety, 
depression  
• Cancer and smoking beliefs : Stigma , quit motivation, self -efficacy 
to quit, importance of quitting, perceived benefits of quitting 
smoking , quit -smoking medication beliefs  
• Physical symptoms: Cravin gs 
• Environmental influences: Level of second -hand smoke exposure, 
perceived social support , perceived provider support  
For each of the 6, we will test the effects of these moderators  listed 
above on the outcomes. We test the effects of these moderators in 
logistic regression models to determine their associ ation with tobacco 
abstinence. Once a parsimonious multivariate model is developed, 
treatment arm will be included to test for the effect of the i ntervention 
on the moderators. Interactions between the tr eatment arm and the 
moderators will assess the relationship between the moderators an d 
the treatment group on the effectiveness outcomes.  
Also, GEE will be used to look at longitudinal models.  
Multiple comparisons will be accounted for by considering Bonfe rroni 
adjustments.  
9.8.2  Aim 3: To assess the processes of implementation and dissemination  
(acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, treatment fidelity, cost 
effectiveness, penetration/reach, and sustainability) of our intervention 
at community oncology sites.  
To gain an initial understanding of implementation processes, for Aim 
3 we will foll ow Proctor and colleagues’ recommended taxonomy for 
measurement of implementation outcomes19. Specifically, we will 
measure acceptability (satisfaction with content/delive ry), adoption 
(program uptake), appropriateness (relevance), cost, and treatment 
fidelity/adaptation and penetration (reach) and sustainability. These 
implementation outcomes will be assessed with mixed methods using 
qualitative and quantitative data to be  collected from patient s, tobacco 
treatment counselor s, NCORP oncology PIs and provid er 
clinicians/staff, and EHR documentation . 
We will use descriptive statistics to summarize implementation 
outcomes (Acceptability, Adoption, Appropriateness, Fidelity, Co st, 
Penetration and Sustainability) and conduct treatment group 
comparisons (i.e., Ac ceptability).  
We will explore organizational readiness  and site level engagement 
using existing quantitative and qualitative data respectively.  In order 
to examine the generalizability of the study findings to the full NCORP 
network of cancer care delive ry sites, we will use the most recent 
(2017) existing N CORP Landscape data to conduct preliminary 
analyses comparing participating and nonparticipating sites on 
relevant site characteristics.  Rev. Add 4 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
71 9.8.2.1  Acceptability  
Satisfaction with various aspects of the tobacco t reatment 
program will be evaluated through participant survey 
responses and post -treatment in terviews with a subset of 
patient participants. Patient Surveys. At the 6 -month 
surveys, participant satisfaction will be assessed:  
1 To what extent has the tobacc o treatment program met 
your needs?;  
2 How satisfied were you with the smoking cessation 
assistance received?;  
3. How helpful was the smoking cessation assistance?;  
4. Would you recommend this program?  
Proportions of participants answering these questions will 
be compared between the arms using chi -squared tests.  
9.8.2.2  Adoption  
Using the baseline, 12 - and 36-month staff surveys, we will 
conduct paired t -tests and chi -square test to assess 
pre/post changes in organizational readiness (ORIC) and 
tobacco treatmen t delivery practices.  
9.8.2.3  Appropriateness  
To measure perceived fit and relevance, we will report on 
the 12 - and 36-month staff surveys and interviews of 
NCORP PIs, clinicians, and staff about the VIT’s a) 
suitability, b) applicability, and c) match for their p atients 
and site, as well as d) perceptions of site usual care 
content and implementation.  
9.8.2.4  Fidelity 
We will evaluate the use and effectiveness of brief videos  
on enrollment using the Fisher’s exact test: brief videos  
open (y/n) and enrollment (y/n). Using participant self -
reported survey data, counselor process data, and quitline 
data, we will ev aluate study treatment and non -study 
treatment (i.e., site -specific usual care, outside resources) 
utilization. We will dichotomize medication and cou nseling 
use in to low vs. high ( ≥ 8 weeks of NRT;  ≥ 8 sessions) 
levels of treatment utilization.191 Within each group, we will 
use chi -square tests and ANOVAs to explore the 
association between participant characteristics and 
treatment utilization. We will use chi -square  tests to 
compare  the association of treatment utilization ( brief 
videos  open, level of medication and counseling use) on 
smoking outcomes. To predict smoking outcomes, we will 
use logistic regression models, which will include 
medication and counseling us e levels, adjusti ng for 
confounders . 
9.8.2.5  Cost Rev. Add2  Rev. Add3  
Rev. Add 4 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
72 We will calculate the incremental cost per quit of the 
intervention relative to EUC over the 6 -month follow -up 
period as follows: (total per -person costs of intervention – 
total per -person costs of EUC)/(cessation rate with the 
intervention – cessation rate with EUC ).192 Cessation rates 
will be based on the primary outcome. Statistical 
uncertainty in cost and effectiveness inputs will be 
incorporated into the increme ntal cost per qui t 
comparisons using Monte Carlo simulation methods 
allowing us to determine whether these ratios are 
significantly different from zero and allowing us to assess 
the proportion of simulation outcomes above or below 
relevant thresholds. The robustness of the  cost-
effectiveness ratio estimates will be further examined in 
sensitivity analyses in which each parameter is varied, 
singly and in combination, through plausible ranges. We 
will also generate “best case” and “worst case” analyses. 
Using Wilcoxon rank s um tests and trend tests ( Cochran –
Armitage ), we will explore patient and site characteristics 
associated with implementation outcomes . We will also 
collect cost data on EUC components including staff time 
required to assess smoking status  and refer curren t 
smokers to this tobacco treatment trial.  
9.8.2.6  Penetration  
We will compare proportion of smokers who participate at 
each NCORP site using chi -square tests. We will analyze 
data collected from the study sites ’ screening logs 
maintained in REDCa p (see A ppendix Z 2D). This 
procedure is outlined in Section 5.1. We will compare 
patient characteristics between enrollees and refusers  and 
screenees from DCP -001 using univariate analyses (chi -
square or Fisher’ s exact tests and  Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests) to examine the associations of patient characteristics 
(e.g. sociodemographics, medical and smoking history, 
cancer treatment , when available ) with enrollment (Y/N) . 
9.8.2.7  Sustainability  
We report on interviews with the  NCORP site 
PIs/c linicians/staff to assess sustainability. Specifically, we 
report on: a) challenges likely to be encountered in 
providing cessation medications, b) challenges likely to be 
encountered in providing cessation counseling, c) 
resources needed to maintain deliv ery of tobacco 
treatment and d) preferences for a site -based centralized 
tobacco treatment program.  
9.8.2.8  Organizational readiness  
We will use staff survey data collected at baseline and 
follow -up to explore the association between 
organization al readiness and site characteristics, and 
whether there  are differences in organizational readiness Rev. Add2  
Rev. A dd3 
Rev. Add 4 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
73 by professional/specialty groups, practice type, etc. Within 
site/practice level analysis will examine aggregate ORIC 
scores stratified by survey responden t type (e.g., CCDR 
leads, medical oncologists, oncology nurses) and how 
organizational readiness differs across these individuals. 
Organizational readiness will be operationalized as an 
ORIC survey score from the 12 -item ORIC survey which 
uses a five -point  Likert scale ranging from 1 (disagree) to 5 
(agree). Se ven items represent the change efficacy 
subscale and five items represent the change commitment 
subscale. Change efficacy scores will be calculated from 
five items assessing expertise, coordination, a bility to 
manage site politics, ability to handle challe nges, 
organizational supports, and tracking implementation 
progress. Change commitment scores will be computed 
from the five items assessing staff commitment, 
determination, motivation and the ability  to do whatever it 
takes to implement tobacco use assess ment and 
treatment. Predictors of baseline organizational readiness 
will be implementation context variables such as NCORP 
site designation, organizational, clinical staff, and 
population characterist ics, and the capacity to provide 
cancer care delivery se rvices. Additional determinants of 
organizational readiness, particularly, change valence, a 
determinant of change commitment211 – how staff 
perceive tobacco treatment interventions and informational 
assessment, a determinant of change efficacy211 – staff 
perceptions of resource availability and situational factors 
favorable to implementing tobacco treatment interventions 
will be explored in multivariable models. Baseline, 12 -and 
36-month ORIC survey s cores will be analyzed for 
longitudinal changes in chang e efficacy and commitment 
over the course of the study period.  
9.8.2.9  Site level engagement  
We will carry our content analysis of monthly meeting 
minutes. Data will be stratified by representation of 
stakeh olders in monthly meetings (Who); at what point i n 
the project stakeholders are engaged (When); how 
stakeholders engage in the research project e.g., 
consultations, advisors/experts, information, recruiting or 
retaining participants, dissemination efforts (How and how 
much); and the impact stakeholders h ave on the project 
(What). Engagement interactions will be quantified into 
high, moderate and low levels of engagement. We will then 
assess the association between engagement level and 
organizational and cli nical characteristics (i.e., 
organizational, clin ical, patient population, characteristics) 
and capacity to provide cancer care delivery services (i.e., 
smoking cessation and treatment services).  Rev. Add 4 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
74 Qualitative data from focus groups described in Aim 3 will 
be used to examine the process of engaging commun ity 
oncology sites in community engaged research (CEnR), 
evaluate facilitators and barriers to engagement, and 
identify implementation strategies to facilitate engagement 
and the adoption of tobacco treatment  at the sub affiliate 
level. Guided by the CFIR2 0 we will use domains depicting 
engagement (inner setting, process, characteristics of 
individuals) and select constructs within the domains20 to 
examine determinants of engagement, select appropriate 
impleme ntation strategies to facilitate engagement, and  to 
understand where those strategies can be employed in the 
implementation process.  
Data will be analyzed using an inductive approach and the 
constant comparative method.212 Using a three -stage 
analytical a pproach,213 we will begin with open coding, 
data immersion and marginal remarks. Axial coding will 
then be used to allow for the identification of relationships 
between codes. Finally, selective coding will be used for 
the integration of all codes into cor e categories/themes. 
We will code for 1) facilit ators and barriers to engagement 
and 2) implementation strategies to facilitate engagement 
and the adoption of tobacco treatment interventions within 
the CFIR domains and constructs. Independent coding 
with c lear documentation of thematic development follo wed 
by assessing for inter -rater reliability (alpha >.80) among 
coders and iterative data processing will ensure that the 
qualitative results are confirmable. Strategy domains such 
as the action, action targe t, and implementation outcome 
affected will be d escribed.

9.11 Study Monitoring  
This study wi ll be monitored by the ECOG -ACRIN Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC). The DSMC meets twice each year. For each meeting, all 
monitored studies are reviewed for safety and progress toward comple tion. When 
approp riate, the DSMC will also review interim a nalyses of outcome data. Copies 
of the toxicity reports prepared for the DSMC meetings are included in the study 
reports prepared for the ECOG -ACRIN group meeting (except that for double 
blind stud ies, the DSMC may  review unblinded toxicity data, while onl y pooled or 
blinded data will be made public). These group meeting reports are made 
available to the local investigators, who may provide them to their IRBs. Only the 
study statistician and the DSM C members will ha ve access to interim analyses of 
outcome d ata. Prior to completion of this study, any use of outcome data will 
require approval of the DSMC. Any DSMC recommendations for changes to this 
study will be circulated to the local investigators i n the form of add enda to this

76 10. Specimen Submission  and Analysis  
Participants who self -report smoking abstinence of at least 7 days  at mo nth 3 and/or 
mont h 6 (Supplemental Appendix B or C) , on eit her the survey or during survey 
outreach, will be requested to provide saliva for cotinine assessments (Section 10.1). 
EASEE PRO triggers a notification  to MGH and/or NC ORP site staff based on the 
following crit eria: 1) smoking status; 2) NRT use; and 3) e -cigarette use. Saliva samples 
will be tested only for cotinine. To avoid false -positives, participants who report use of 
NRT or e -cigarettes within the  last week will b e offered the opportunity to instead 
compl ete an expired air CO sample (Section 10.2). Saliva cotinine  results will not be 
provide d to the site or the patients. The expired air CO sample results  may be shared 
with the patient  by site staff  at time of th e measure, at the discretion of the physician.  
Smokerlyzers® will be deployed as needed to the centralized site coordinator or 
administrator. We will include a mailing label for them with a pre -stamped address to 
ship it back to us.  Saliva kits will be mai led directly to the patient by MGH. Only one 
Smokerlyzer® will be distributed to each site.  To request a Smokerlyzer® , please 
contact the study team.  
Questions may be directed to the Smokefree Supp ort Study team at  617-643-4765 or 
SmokefreeSupportStudy2@partners.org . 
10.1 Saliva Cotinine Assessments  
For this trial, saliva will be submitted to J2 Laboratories to assay and tested for 
cotinine level s. J2 Laboratorie s is a premier forensic drug and alcohol t esting and 
clinical diagnostic laboratory located in Tuscon, AZ that has successfully 
partnered with the study team for previous saliva cotinine testing (Smokefree 
Support Study 1). Saliva sample t esting results wi ll be sent to the EAQ171CD 
research staff at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The results will not be 
returned to the participant or the institution.  
The saliva sample will be tested only for cotinine to determine the study 
participan t’s exposure to c igarette smoke and nothing else. Saliva sa mples will 
be destroyed after they are assayed for cotinine. No samples will be retained for 
additional research purposes.  
10.1.1  Saliva Submission  
Saliva assessments are requested from patients who self -report 
smoking ab stinence of at least 7 days  and who do not  report the use 
of NRT or e -cigarettes within the last week. Saliva  kits will  be shipped 
directly to the patient by MGH for all subjects who report being quit on 
3- and/or 6 -month follow -up surveys . 
If a sample is designated insufficient for testing by the  lab, MGH will 
notify the participant, who will be offered the opportunity to complete 
additional samples.  
NOTE:  To avoid false -positives, participants who report use of 
NRT or e -cigarettes within the last week wil l be offered the 
opportunity to instead co mplete an expired air CO sample 
(Section 10.2).

10.2 Expired CO  Assessments  
As CO samples must be completed in -person, samples will be completed with a 
member of the local research staff at the site at which the subject was recruited 
and is receivi ng their cancer c are. The NCORP site research staff will be  trained 
in safe and proper use of the CO monitor and test results interpretation. With the 
aim of decreasing participant burden, samples may be completed at an existing 
clinic visit in accordance with patient pref erences.  
Sites will be provided with a n Expired CO Smokerlyzer® which will be used for all 
participants on EA171CD requiring an expired CO assessment.  
Prior to first assessments, contact the Smokefree Support Study team at 617 -
643-4765 to receive training on the use of the Smokerlyzer®, including use of the 
required software or app.  
For each assessment, follow the Test Instructions  and operation manual 
provided. Quick summary of instructions are:  
• Fill in the patient ID, date and time of ass essment on the  Expired CO 
Smoking Status Slip (Appendix IV ) 
• Have the participant complete the questions on the Expired CO Smoking 
Status Slip  
• Obtain the CO assessment, following the instructions provided with the 
instrume nt 
• The participan t should be standing, to allow proper exha lation  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
79 • The participant is to inhale as deeply as possible and hold their breath 
while the display counts down 15 seconds. If they are unable to do so, 
please see the manual on how to address this.  
• At the end of the  countdown, the participant is to blow slo wly into the 
mouthpiece until their lungs are empty  
• Record the results of the assessment on the Expired CO Smoking 
Status:  ppm,  and %COHb  
The results of the CO expiration assessment results and th e participant’s 
answers to the  Expired CO Smoking Status Sl ip are to be entered into 
mediDATA Rave. It is requested that the actual form be uploaded to Rave as 
well. Site staff should please also scan or send the Expired CO Smoking Status 
Slip to the MGH R esearch team via secure email. A copy of the results may be  
given to the participant using the Smokerlyzer® breath CO Test Results , a copy 
which is provided in Appendix IV . 
11. Patient -Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Admi nistration  
11.1 Data C ollection Approach for Patient  Reported Ou tcomes  
We will use a combination of EASEE -PRO and mailed questionnaires for this 
study as described in Section 4.7.5. A proxy or family member can complete the 
questionnaires on behalf of the patie nt as long as the y can speak English or 
Spanish . The questi onnaires are only available in English or Spanish.  
EASEE -PRO’s PRODUCE sub -system allows for the collection and notification of 
study critical events. This allows EASEE to interface with a variety of systems 
and us e external APIs to retrieve data necessary  for study operations.  
11.2 Questionnaire Administr ation Process  
At the time EASEE -PRO account activation, patients will be asked to complete 
paper -based Patient Contact Information Form. The form colle cts information 
used to maintain contact with the participa nt over the course of the study, 
including nam e, home address, phone number, and may include the name of a 
primary (or other) physician to whom requests for patient location may be made 
and a close  friend or family  member.  
This form is retained in the stud y participant’s chart at the site and is not 
submitted to the ECOG -ACRIN RAVE database; the completed form is faxed to 
the central ECOG -ACRIN Outcomes and Economic Assessment Unit (OEAU) 
located at  Brown University  so that the participants can be contacted  for the 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) porti on of the study. The contact information 
is stored in a dedicated SQL database (PII -DB) and IS NOT accessible by 
ECOG -ACRIN database. The OEAU RA will not have access t o the main ECOG -
ACRIN database that contai ns clinical data.  
11.2.1  Patient Contact Infor mation Form  
On the Patient Contact Information Form, patients will be asked for 
telephone numbers and addresses to facilitate contacting for 
completion of que stionnaires.  Pat ients will be asked if they would like 
text message reminders of survey availabil ity as well as email 
reminders.  While the default survey administration method will be on -
line, questionnaires will be sent by mail as requested by the patie nt or Rev. Add2  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
80 as needed b y the study personnel. Administration of q uestionnaires, 
both web -based and paper  will be coordinated by the OEAU. 
Administration of the questionnaires will be triggered based on 
completion of study milestones marked by submission of forms  in 
RAVE and EASE E-PRO.  
Patients will be prompted to comple te web -based forms via an email 
prompt (push notifications or SMS as applicable to the study). These 
notifications will include a link to the web site for questionnaire 
completion. Questionnaires w ill be completed on line using a unique 
patient account. Th e web site will reference a toll -free p hone number 
and email address that patients can use to reach the OEAU staff 
should they have questions or need assistance. All data will be stored 
on a secure  server. Patients  who do not complete the web 
questionnaire s within 3 working days of the initial request e -mail will 
receive up to 3 additional reminders, each 3 days apart. These 
reminders, like the initial notification, will provide a link to the website 
for the curren t surveys, ask th e participant to confirm t hat they have 
been able to access the web site, and pro vide both the e -mail address 
and the toll free help number for support.  
If patients still have not responded within 14 days of the original e -
mail, the OEAU R esearch Associate  may attempt to telephone the 
patient and administer the questionnaire over the t elephone. The 
OEAU may send a questionnaire in the mail if the on -line version is 
not completed.  If questionnaires are telephone -administered, they will 
be m arked as such in the database. All surveys,  while desired within 3 
days of the event, will remain available for participants until either the 
surveys are completed or they are off -study.  Since the completion 
date is recorded for all surveys, the study tea m will be able to  make 
relevant determinati ons for inclusion of this data in specific analyses. 
However, after telephone follow -up, no additional or extraordinary 
means will be employed to collect overdue/missing questionnaires.  
11.2.2  Mailed questionnaire comple tion  
Mailed ques tionnaire packets will inc lude a letter introducing the study 
and include a study -specific toll -free phone number that patients can 
use to reach the OEAU staff should they have questions or need 
assistance, questionnaires, and pre -addresse d, stamped envelo pes 
for return mailing to the OEAU. If patients do not complete the paper 
questionnaire within 10 working days of the date of the mailing, the 
OEAU RA may attempt to telephone or text the patient. If the patient 
has not received the paper questionnaires, a dditional questionnaires 
will be sent after confirming the correct mailing  address. If the 
questionnaire is available to the patient, the OEAU RA will urge the 
study patient to complete and return the questionnaire. If the patient 
has stil l not responded w ithin 20 working days of t he original mailing, 
the OEAU may attempt to tel ephone the patient and telephone 
administer the questionnaire. If questionnaires are telephone -
administered, they will be marked as such in the data base.

82 12. Electronic Data Capture  
Please refer to the EAQ171 CD Forms Comple tion Guidelines for the forms submission 
schedule. Data collection will be performed in Medi data Rave , EASEE -PRO , and 
REDCap . 
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System  (CDUS) version 3.0. 
Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarter ly from the ECOG -ACRIN Operations 
Office – Boston to CTEP by electronic mea ns. 
Patient indiv idual and NC ORP PI/Clinici an/Staff Focus Group Interview Analyses : 
Data analyses will occur coincident to data collection so that we can ascertain if thematic 
satur ation (the point at which no new data are generated) has been achieved for each 
strata (trea tment group,  site). Interv iews will be recorded, transcri bed and analyzed 
using NVivo qualitative software. Content analyses will be conducted by the two RAs 
and ov erseen by Drs. Park and Ostroff. The coders will meet to develop the themat ic 
framework, cat egories, and  coding plan. To ensure coding reliability, coding 
discrepancies will be resolved through discussi on and comparison of raw data. Coding 
will continue un til a hi gh level of reliability (Kappa= >0.80) is established. Patient 
individual interview r esults will be analyzed by  strata comparisons. NCORP site 
participants’ focus group interviews will be analyzed according to appropriateness and 
feasibility.  
13. Patien t Consent and Peer Judgment  
Current FDA, NCI, state, federal and institutio nal regulations c oncerning in formed 
consent  will be followed  for the main portion of the study.  
13.1 Waivers of Consent  
13.1.1  Screening  
Per 45 CFR 46.117c, a waiver of documentation of consent  for the 
screening of study eligibility and recruitment of smokers is justi fied for 
the foll owing reason s 
• screening el igibility review of medical records by clinical research 
staff does not affect the rights or welfare of subjects because 
medical record in formation is screened to establish preliminary 
eligibility prior to approac hing a potential subject,  
• screening eligibi lity review of medical records cannot practicably 
be done with the waiver due to the number of services 
participating in which the patient s may be eligible. Screening 
eligibility decreases the burden on patients o f introducing a 
research stud y to patients who can easily be identified through 
screening activities as not eligible for a research study,  
• screening eligibility review of medical re cords involves no more 
than minimal risk because the person accessing the i nformation 
has un dergone trai ning in confid entiality of medical records, and 
the records are viewed solely to screen for eligibility criteria and 
only minimal information found in t he screening process will be 
recorded for research purposes.  
ECOG -ACRI N EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
83 13.1.2  Waiver of elem ents of informed consent – site staff  
We re quest a waiver of specific elements of consent regarding 
medical treatment, medical risks, and injury to site staff participants. 
This stu dy does not involve medical treatment of site staff, and these 
elements of informed consent would not ap ply to site st aff 
participating in the individual staff surveys and focus group interviews. 
We have therefore removed these sections from the model cons ent 
form. Omission of this information does not constitute greater than 
minimal risk and wou ld not adver sely affect th e site staff participants .

VWD on prophyla cticregimen) will be included, composed of:
a)up to 22 adult subjects transitioning from Study 071301;
b)up to 34 pediatric subjects transitioning from Study 071102;
c)at least 7 up to 15 new ly enrolled adult (aged ≥18years) and pediatric/adolescent (aged 12 to <18 years) 
subjects who have been receiving VWF products for on -demand (OD) treatment.
The number of subjects in this study is prim arily driven by the number of subjects who could transition from the 
2 parent studies, 071301 and 071102, as w ell as practical considerations and the EMA Guideline on the Clinical 
Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor Products (CP MP/BPWG/220/02). Sample size is

traumatic) in adult and pediatric subjects
Exploratory
In adult and pediatric subjects treated w ith rVWF (vonicog alfa):
To obtain additional data on the efficacy of perioperative bleeding management with rVWF (vonicog alfa) if 
surgery is required
To assess pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and to monitor 
incremental recovery of rVWF (vonicog alfa) over time in adult and pediatric subjects
To assess health -related Quality of Life (HRQoL) data, treatment satisfaction and health resource utilization 
over time for subjects receiving rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophylaxis
Rationale:
To evaluate the long -term safety and hemostatic efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophylaxis in adult and 
pediatric/adolescent (aged 12 to <18 years) subjects with severe VWD w ith the option of once weekly dosing, 
and to further assess the safety and efficacy of rVWF in OD treatment of bleeding episodes, a nd in perioperative 
management of surgical bleeding in adult and pediatric subjects of all ages with severe VWD.
Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration:
Recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF, vonicog alfa) is administered intravenously.
Prophylactic Treatment
a.Cohort 1 : Adult subjects from Study 071301 who will continue with the same prophylactic treatment 
regimen from Study 071301, which is expected to be 50 (±10) IU/kg recombinant von Willebrand factor: 
Ristocetin cofactor (rVWF:RCo) tw ice weekly for the majority of subjects. 
b.Cohort 2 : Adult subjects from Study 071301 who experienced no clinically significant bleeding episode 
over the past 6 months and who elected to follow  the recommendation by the investigator to start 
prophylactic treatment in this study with reduced dosing frequency and/or change of dose per infusion.
c.Cohort 3 : Pediatric/adolescent subjects aged 12 to <18 years who: 
 transition from Study 071102 with at least 3 bleeding episodes (not including menorrhag ia) that 
required treatment with a VWF product and occurred over the past 12 months, and
 are considered eligible for prophylactic treatment per investigator's medical/clinical assessment 
may receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) for prophylaxis if they elect to go on prophylactic treatment following 
the recommendation by the investigator. 
The dosage selected may be either: 
a) Twice weekly 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo, or
b) Once w eekly 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo 
based on the investigator's assessment and recommendation.
Dosage may be individualized w ithin this range and, in consultation with the sponsor, increased up to 
80IU/kg if considered necessary to assure effective prophylaxis, based on:
 subject’s available historical PK data
 type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced 
 monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures for the subject

d.Cohort 4: Newly enrolled adult and pediatric/adolescent (aged 12 to <18 years) subjects who: 
 were previously treated w ith VWF products for bleeding episodes OD, with at least 3 bleeding 
episodes (BE), excluding menorrhagia, that occurred over the past 12 months, and
 are considered eligible for prophylactic treatment based on the investigator's medical/clinical 
assessment 
will receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) at once weekly dose of 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Dosage may be 
individualized within this range and, in consultation with the sponsor, increased up to 80 IU/kg if 
considered necessary to assure effective prophylaxis, based on:
 subject’s available histor ical PK data
 type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced
 monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures for the subject
For all subjects on prophylaxis, dose and/or dose frequency will be increased based on bleeding episo de dose -
escalation criteria. Dose escalations (not exceeding the upper limit of 80 IU/kg rVWF:RCo per dose) and/or 
increase of dose frequency will only be allowed in case of insufficient therapeutic response w ith breakthrough 
bleeding episodes. The criteri a for dose and/or dose frequency escalation are specific to each bleeding location 
but, in general, involve 1 significant breakthrough bleeding episode despite the subject being compliant with 
scheduled prophyl actic treatment. For subjects who require a do se escalation due to a breakthrough bleed, the 
frequency should preferentially be kept the same but the dose (IU VWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased 
upto 80 IU VWF:RCo. Based on the subject's bleeding history, investigator's clinical judgement and the 
pharmacokinetic data (if available), dose escalation by increasing the dose frequency should be considered. 
Changes in dose or dose frequency should only be done in consultation with the Sponsor. (For details on dose 
escalation, please refer to protocol Section 6.2.2.1.2 .)
Treatment of Bleeding Episodes
Cohort 5 : will consist of pediatric subjects of all ages (aged <18 years) from Study 071102 w ho are 
considered not eligible for prophylactic treatment based on the investigator's medical/clinical assessment or 
who elect notto follow the recommendation by the investigator to transition to prophylaxis
Cohort 6 : will consist of adult subjects from Study 071301 who are considered by the principal investigator 
(PI) as medically more suitable for OD treatment or who prefer to switch back to OD treatment regimen
Dosage and frequency must be individualized based on the subject’s weight, VWD type and severity of bleeding 
episode and monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. In general, an initial dose of 40 to 
60IU/kg VWF:RCo is recommended. Depending on the subject’s baseline factor VIII (FVIII) level, rVWF 
should be given with or w ithout 30 to 45 IU/kg AD VATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (rVWF: rFVIII ratio of 
1.3± 0.2:1). The rFVIII dose should be calculated according to the difference between the subject´s baseline 
plasma FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C), and the desired peak FVIII:C level to achieve appropriate plasma 
FVIII:C level. In cases of major bleeding episodes, a dose of up to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may be infused. If 
necessary, subsequent doses of 40 to 60 IU/kg VWF:RCo will be administered every 8 to 24 hours with or 
without ADVATE [rFVIII, octoco g alfa] (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below  30 IU/dL 
during the treatment period) to maintain VWF:RCo and FVIII levels for as long as deemed necessary by the 
investigator.

rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 D ec2021
The dose and frequency o f administration of rVWF will be individualized based on the type of surgery, PK 
results, and VWF and FVIII levels. In general, the dose will be tailored to raise the VWF:RCo concentration to 
100% of normal for major surgeries, and to 50% to 60% of normal for minor and oral surgeries. 
For subjects undergoing elective surgery , an rVWF prim ing dose is to be infused 12 to 24 hours prior to surgery 
in subjects w ith inadequate levels of FVIII, to allow  the endogenous FVIII levels to increase to at least 30 IU/d L 
(for minor and oral surgery) or 60 IU/dL (for major surgery) before the loading dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa).
For both elective and emergency surgery , an rVWF loading dose should be administered within 3 hours prior to 
surgery. ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alf a) may be administered in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in order to 
raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels. 
The detailed dosing calculations are provided in the protocol, as a general guidance, a loading dose of 40 to 60 
IU/kg rVWF:RCo should be adm inistered. ADVATE, at a dose of 30 to 45 IU/kg may be infused sequentially, 
preferably within 10 minutes after the rVWF infusion in subjects whose FVIII plasma levels already are (or are 
highly likely to be) less than 40 to 50 IU/dL for minor/oral surgery or 80 to 100 IU/dL for major surgery before 
the initiation of the surgery. At the discretion of the investigator, the ADVATE dose may be increased in subjects 
requiring emergency surgery who did not receive a preoperative priming dose.
The peri -and postop erative substitution regimen will be individualized according to PK results; intensity, and 
duration of the hemostatic challenge; and the institution’s standard of care. Dosing should be guided by the 
dosing recommendations (provided in protocol) and conti nued until healing is achieved.
PK Assessment
For subjects in Cohort 4, the PK dose is 50 (±5) IU/kg rVWF:RCo for the initial PK assessment at the beginning 
of the study. Additionally, subjects in Cohorts 1 -4 will undergo steady state PK assessment at the EOS ,and the 
PK dose is their last scheduled prophylactic dose.
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3b, prospective, open label , uncontrolled, non -random ized, multicenter study evaluating 
long-term safety and efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) for prophylaxis (preventative treatment before bleeds 
occur) and OD (treatment of acute bleeds when they occur) treatment of bleeding episodes in pediatric and adult 
subjects with severe VWD. The study plans to include cohorts as below :
Prophylactic treatment cohorts
1.Adult subjects transitioning from the phase 3 Prophylaxis study (Study 071301) w ho will remain on the 
same prophylactic dose as in Study 071301
2.Adult subjects transitioning from Study 071301 w ith no clinically significant bleeding episode for the past 
6months who will start this phase 3b study at a low er dose/frequency compared to the dose received in 
Study 071301
3.Pediatric/adolescent subjects aged 12 to <18 years transitioning from the phase 3 pediatric study 
(Study 071102) who switch from receiving OD treatm ent to receiving once weekly or tw ice w eekly 
prophylaxis 
4.Newly enrolled adult and pediatric/adolescent (aged 12 to <18 years) subjects switching from OD treatment 
with VWF products, starting once weekly prophylaxis with rVWF (vonicog alfa) in this phase 3 b extension

On-demand treatment cohorts
5.Pediatric subjects of all ages from Study 071102 who will continue with receiving OD treatment 
6.Adult subjects from Study 071301 who will switch back from prophylactic treatment to OD treatment
Adult subjects transitioning from Study 071301 w ho agree to continue prophylactic treatment will be given an 
opportunity to re -evaluate their prophylactic dose at the beginning of this study; if a subject experienced no 
bleeding episode over the last 6 months of their pr ophylactic treatment in Study 071301, the subject may be given 
a reduced dosage in this study (at the discretion of the principal investigator based on the detailed guidance 
provided in the protocol) (Cohort 2). Otherwise subjects will continue with the pr ophylactic treatment regimen 
from Study 071301 (Cohort 1), which is expected to be 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo twice weekly for the majority 
of subjects.
Pediatric/adolescent subjects aged 12 to <18 years transitioning from the pediatric study 071102 w ho are 
considered eligible by the investigator for switching to prophylaxis may select to go on prophylactic treatment 
with rVWF (vonicog alfa) (Cohort 3) at a dose of either 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo once weekly or twice weekly 
based on the investigator's assessment and recommendation. Dosage may be individualized w ithin this range and, 
in consultation with the sponsor, increased up to 80 IU/kg if considered nec essary to assure effective prophylaxis, 
based on: a) subject’s available historical PK data; b) type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has 
experienced; c) monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures for the subject.
Newly enrolle d adult and pediatric/adolescent ( aged 12 to <18 years )subjects (Cohort 4) will all be initially 
assigned to a prophylactic regimen of 50(±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo once per w eek with rVWF (vonicog alfa) if 
they are considered eligible and recommended by the in vestigator to receive prophyla cticregimen and they 
choose to agree w ith the investigator’s recommendation. The starting dose, after consultation with the Sponsor, 
can be increased up to 80 IU/kg if considered necessary to assure effective prophylaxis.
Theremaining pediatric subjects (aged <18 years) from all age cohorts in Study 071102 who will not transition to 
prophylaxis (Cohort 5) and adult subjects from 071301 who are assigned (either based on medical assessment or 
individual preference) to switch ba ck to OD regimen (Cohort 6) w ill receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) as OD (to treat 
acute bleeds when they occur) treatment in this study.
For all subjects on prophylactic treatment (Cohorts 1 to 4), dose and/or dose frequency will be increased based on 
bleeding episode dose -escalation criteria. (Please refer to Section 6.2.2.1.2 in the protocol for dose escalation 
details.)
For all cohorts, during the entir e study observation period, any bleeding episodes requiring substitution therapy 
with VWF will be treated w ith rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa). If surgery 
is needed, subjects will receive rVWF (vonicog alfa), w ith or w ithout ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa), for 
management of perioperative bleeding.
Once assigned, the cohort number of a subject will remain unchanged during the study. Change of treatment 
regimen will not result in switching of cohorts.
Minimum observation time for this study is 12 months and after this initial 12 -month period, subjects w ill 
continue to be enrolled until rVWF (vonicog alfa) is commercially available in their respective countries or until 
subjects have been treated in the study for a maximum of 3 years, whichever occurs first.

Statistical Analysis:
Analy sis Sets
The safety analysis set will be composed of all subjects who received any amount of rVWF (vonicog alfa).
The full analysis set (FAS) will be composed of all enrolled subjects who received IP treatment.
The PK analysis set (PKAS) will be composed of all subjects who received at least one study drug infusion with 
one quantifiable post -dose measurement without any significant protocol deviations or events with potential to 
affect PK.
The per protocol analysis set (PPAS) w ill be composed of all subject s in the FAS who have no major deviations 
from the protocol affecting the study results with respect to efficacy. Major protocol deviations will be defined in 
the Protocol Deviation Plan.
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint, spontan eous ABR during the first 12 months on prophylactic treatment with 
rVWF (vonicog alpha), will be calculated as the number of spontaneous (as assessed by the investigator) bleeds 
requiring treatment with a VWF product during the first 12 months on study tre atment, and summarized through 
descriptive statistics by prophylactic cohort (Cohorts 1to4), and age group. The primary analysis will be based 
on the FAS and will be repeated on the PPAS as sensitivity analysis.
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Safety
Safety analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set by age group overall and by cohort ,by dose regimen ,
if necessary ,on 12, 24 -month data and the entire study data.
Treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with start dates on or after t he first exposure to IP. 
Summaries on AEs will be based on TEAEs unless otherwise indicated.
Frequency counts and percentages will be calculated for AEs and SAEs and presented in summary tables. AEs 
will be cross -tabulated for relatedness, seriousness, and severity. AEs will be categorized according to MedDRA 
dictionary and summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. Counts, frequency and annualized 
rates for thrombotic events and hypersensitivity reactions together with exact Clopper- Pearson 2-sided 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) on their occurrence will be tabulated.
Temporally associated AEs are defined as AEs that begin during infusion or within 24 hours (or 1 day where time 
of onset is not available) after completion of infusion, irres pective of being related or not related to treatment. 
Temporally associated AEs will be presented in summary tables. Causally related AEs will be presented 
similarly.

A listing of all AEs will be presented by subject identifier, age, sex, preferred term an d reported term of the AE, 
duration, severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, causality assessment by investigator, onset date, stop date, 
and medication or non -drug therapy to treat the AE.
For immunogenicity analysis, frequency counts, and proportions will be calculated for subjects with the 
occurrence of neutralizing (inhibitory) antibodies to VWF and FVIII, occurrence of binding antibodies to VWF 
and FVIII, and occurrence of binding antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary proteins, mouse IgG a nd rFurin.
Vital signs and laboratory parameters will be summarized descriptively. Shift tables will be prepared for 
laboratory parameters. Clinically significant abnormal values in routine laboratory parameters and vital signs will 
be summarized.
Efficacy of Prophylaxis
All secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed on the FAS by age group and cohort on 12 -month data and the 
entire study. Continuous endpoints will be summarized by mean (2 -sided 95% CI when appropriate), standard 
deviation (SD), median, range, and quartiles. Categorical endpoints will be summarized by proportions and 
2-sided 95% CI w ill be provided w hen appropriate.
The spontaneous ABR (as calculated for the primary endpoint) will be summarized through descriptive statistics 
by prophylact ic cohort (Cohorts 1 to4) and age group.
For the cohorts receiving prophylactic treatment (cohorts 1 to 4) the number and proportion of subjects w ith 
dosing frequency of 1, 2, and ≥3 w eekly will be evaluated at the end of 12 -month treatment period and at the end 
of the study, in total and by cohort and age group, accompanied by a 2 -sided 95% CI.
The number and proportion of subjects with categorized spontaneous ABR (i.e., 0, 1 to 2, 3 to 5, or >5 bleeds) 
will be provided by cohort and age group, accompanied by  a 2-sided 95% CI.
Summary statistics for the time to first bleeding event under each prophylaxis treatment regimen will be provided 
by cohort and age group using Kaplan -Meier plots.
The spontaneous ABR (as calculated for the primary endpoint) will als o be summarized by location of bleeding 
(GI, epistaxis, joint bleeding, menorrhagia, oral and other mucosa, muscle, and soft tissue, etc.).
Summary statistics for the total number of infusions, average number of infusions per w eek, as w ell as number 
(propo rtion) of subjects on different prophylaxis dosing regimens will be provided by cohort and age group when 
applicable and overall for prophylaxis arms. The total w eight -adjusted consumption of rVWF (vonicog alfa) (and 
of ADVATE [rFVIII, octocog alfa] if app licable) during prophylactic treatment will be provided similarly.
The count and proportion of subjects that require no transfusion over time to maintain hemoglobin level will be 
calculated and summarized by cohort and age group. The ferritin levels over time will be summarized 
descriptively.
Efficacy of Treatment of Bleeding Episodes
The analysis will be performed on the FAS overall by age group and by treatment arm. The efficacy rating will be 
followed for the first 12 months (on study treatment) only.

For the number of infusions of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) per bleeding episode, 
for the weight -adjusted consumption of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) per bleeding 
event as well as for the overall hemostatic efficacy rating at resolution of bleed, summary statistics will be 
presented.
The cause, type, severity, and localization of bleeding episodes w ill also be recorded and summarized. Bleeding 
episodes w ill be organized by where they occur in addition to w hether they occurred spontaneously or due to a 
traumatic event.
Analysis of Exploratory Outcome Measures :
Efficacy of Perioperative Management
The analysis will be performed on the FAS for the first 12 months of study data, except for the w eight -adjusted 
dose that will be followed for the entire study.
Descriptive statistics will be performed for the following outcome measures:
Intraoperative actual versus predicted blood loss (assessed by operating surgeon) at completion of surgery.
Intraoperative hemostatic efficacy score on a scale of excellent, good, moderate or none (assessed by 
operating surgeon) at completion of surgery.
Overall hemostatic efficacy by the investigator 24 hours after the last perioperative infusion of rVWF 
(vonicog alfa) or at day 14 pos t operation, w hichever occurs first.
Daily intra -and postoperative weight -adjusted dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or w ithout ADVATE 
(rFVIII, octocog alfa) through postoperative day 14.
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
For subjects in the PKAS, the following PK param eters , based on the serial PK assessment, will be calculated for 
each adult subject and for each pediatric subject when applicable in Cohort 1, 2, 3 ,or 4 and reported using 
descriptive statistics for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB: IR, T 1/2,MRT, AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-96h, Cmax, Tmax, V ss, 
and CL. The corresponding PD of rVWF (vonicog alfa), as measured in FVIII activity (FVIII:C) based on the PK 
assessment, will be assessed using C max, Tmaxand AUC 0
-96h. These PD parameters will be listed and summarized 
descriptively.
Incremental recovery will be summarized by visit and displayed graphically over time for each subject in 
prophyla cticcohorts (Cohort 1 to 4) for the initial 12 months of prophylactic treatment .
HRQoL, Treatment Satisfaction and H ealth Resource Utilization
The analysis will be performed on the FAS by cohort and age group at baseline, 6 and 12 months, and at the end 
of the study.
HRQoL, treatment satisfaction and health resource use data will be summarized descriptively and listed p er

2.INTRODUCTION
2.1Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most frequently  inherited bleeding disorder, affecting 
approximately  1% of the general population, although the inci dence of clinically  relevant cases is 
lower, about 100 cases per million (Gill 2007 ; Goodeve et al. 2010 ; Mannucci 2004) .
VWD is classified into 3 main ty pes (1, 2, and 3) with peculiar phenot ype and genot ype 
(Gill 2007 ):
1.Type 1 VWD, accounting for up to 70% of patients diagnosed with von Willebrand factor 
(VWF) disease, is a partial quantitative deficiency, induced by  mutations, mostly  missense 
mutations that produce a wide range of pathoph ysiologic effects including abnormal 
transcription, subcellular storage and secretion and accelerated clearance. Type 1 VWD 
patients mostly  display  mild clinical sy mptoms.
2.Type 2 VWD, which accounts for about 20% to 30% of the patients, is further divided into 
4 subty pes (2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. 
Mutations causing VWD ty
pes 2A, 2B, 2M, 2N variously  affect VWF multimer assembly  
and pr oteol ysis, VWF -dependent platelet adhesion, or the VWF factor VIII (FVIII) binding 
site. The bleeding diathesis is usually  moderate and affects primaril y the mucosal tissues. 
Patients with 2N VWD are sometimes misdiagnosed as having mild hemophilia A.
3.Type3 VWD, account for 1% to 5% of VWD patients, exhibiting a total or near total 
absence of VWF protein and activity  and consequently  very  low FVIII levels (<10 IU/dL) 
(Sadler et al. 2006 ). Type 3 VWD is associated with severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms 
(bleeding occurs in mucosal tissues, muscle, and joints). The inheritance pattern is 
codominant alleles (with both parents exhibiting ty pe 1 VWD). The mutations responsible 
for ty pe 3 VWD are highly  varied and include large deletions in the VWF gene as well as 
missense mutations that prevent VWF bios ynthesis and secretion.
All VWD patients, particularly  those with ty pe 2 or ty pe 3 disease, are at increased risk for 
life-threatening bleeding, requiring immediate or even prophy lactic VWF replacement therap y 
tocorrect VWF deficiency and/or the secondary  FVIII deficiency . The aim of VWD treatment 
isto correct the dual defect of hemostasis, i.e., the abnormal coagulation expressed b y low levels 
of FVIII and abnormal platelet adhesion expressed by  the prolonged bleeding time. 
Desmopressin (1
-deamino - 8-D-arginine -vasopressin, DDAVP) is the treatment of choice for 
type 1 VWD because it induces the release of normal VWF from cellular compartments that 
correct the FVIII/VWF levels and the prolonged bleeding time in the majority  of cases 
(Castaman et al. 2003 ). In ty pe 3 and severe forms of types 1 and 2 VWD, DDAVP is not

effective; therefore, for these patients, FVIII and VWF replacement therapy  is used in bleedings, 
surgery , and secondary  long -term prophy laxis (Mannucci 2004) .
2.2Product Background and Clinical Information
VWF is a large multimeric gl ycoprotein (with multimers ranging in molecular weight from 
500to >20000 kDa) that is normally  found in plasma, alpha -granules of platelets, and 
intracellular organelles known as Weibel -Palade bodies. The VWF is carrier molecule for FVIII, 
an essential cofactor of secondary  hemostasis that leads to fibrin clot formation, and facilitates 
platelet adhesion to subendothelium at sites of vascular injury  (Hantgan et al. 1990 ).
Human VWF produced by  recombinant technology  provides a new perspective in treatment of 
VWD ( Fischer 1999) . Limitations associated with plasma -derived VWF (pdVWF) concentrates 
can be overcome b y recombin ant VWF (rVWF). Takeda (formerly  Baxalta and later Shire; 
hereafter referred to as the sponsor) has developed an rVWF, which is s ynthesized by  a 
geneticall y engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that expresses the VWF gene 
(Turecek et al. 2010 ). The differ ences between pdVWF and rVWF are listed in Table 10.

cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container product. The only  proteins present 
in the final container product, other than rVWF, are trace quantities of murine 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) (from the immunoaffinity purification of ADVATE and rVWF); host 
cell (i.e., CHO) protein; rFurin, a propeptide processing enzy me that is u sed to mature the 
pro-rVWF into active rVWF; and rFVIII. Consequently , the theoretical risk of contamination

with an adventitious virus is minimal. Recombinant VWF has undergone extensive in vitro and 
in vivo non -clinical investigation supporting its safe evaluation in humans. The clinical 
development program consists of 5 completed trials (4 in VWD and 1 in hemophilia). 
Available data support the safet y and efficacy  of rVWF (and rVWF administered with ADVATE 
for the first dose to correct FVIII deficiency ) for the prevention and treatment of spontaneous 
and trauma -induced bleeding episodes in adults (18 to 64 y ears) diagnosed with VWD.
Recombinant VWF was granted licensure in the United States in December 2015 under the brand 
name VONVENDI for on- demand (OD) treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults 
diagnosed with VWD, and has been available on the market since August 2016. Also, in 
April 2018, VONVENDI was approved b y the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the 
United States (US) for the additional indication of perioperative management of bleeding in 
adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with VWD. On 31 August 2018, the European Commission 
implemented the decision granting marketing authorization for VEYVONDI (vonicog alfa) for 
the treatment of hemorrhage and surgical bleeding and for the prevention of surgical bleeding in 
adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is 
ineffective or not indicated. On 4 October 2018, VEYVONDI (vonicog alfa) was granted 
licensure in Switzerland by Swissmedic for the treatment of hemorrhage or surgical bleeding in 
VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contra -indicated. 
VEYVONDI should not be used in the treatment of Hemophilia A. On 10 January  2019, 
VONVENDI was authorized in Canada for the treatment and control of bleeding episodes, and 
perioperative management of bleeding in adults (age ≥18) diagnosed with 
VWD. On 
25March 2020, VONVENDI was authorized in Japan by  Ministry  of Health, L abour and 
Welfare (MHLW) for treatment and control of bleeding tendency in patients diagnosed with 
VWD. On 15 April 2020, VEYVONDI was authorized in Australia by Therapeutic Goods 
Administration (TGA) for treatment of haemorrhage and surgical bleeding and for preventi on of 
surgical bleeding in adults (age 18 and older) with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) 
treatment alone is ineffective or not indicated.
A detailed description of rVWF is also provided in the investigator’s brochure (IB).
2.2.1 Nonclinical Studies
2.2.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics
Primary  pharmacod ynamics (PD) were evaluated in different surrogate models of efficacy  using 
VWF -deficient mice, VWF -deficient dogs, and VWF -deficient pigs. An in vitro PD study  
provided evidence that rVWF containing ultralarge multimers ( ULM) is beneficial with respect 
to formation of rVWF -platelet conglomerates and that recombinant A Disintegrin And 
Metalloproteinase with a ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13) is an 
effective regulatory  counterpart to ultralarge rVWF multimer s.

2.2.1.2 Safety Pharmacology
The anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of the co -infusion of ADVATE and rVWF and 
the co- infused product’s effects on blood pressure (BP), cardiac, and respiratory  functions and 
parameters of coagulation activation were investigated in 4 in vivo studies in different animal 
models. Safety  Pharmacology  Studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs revealed no risks for 
anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE in combination with rVWF. All 
observations in safet y pharmaco logy studies are considered to lie within the biological variability  
of animal models or occurred due to known species -specific anaph ylactoid effects of excipients.
2.2.1.3 Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of both rVWF alone and combined with human rF VIII 
(rVWF+ADVATE) were conducted in VWD mice, VWD dogs, VWD pigs, rats, and 
cynomolgus monkey s. Human rVWF stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD 
pigs, and VWD dogs. Furthermore, the h ypotheses that the area under the plasma 
concentration/time c urve (AUC) with rVWF alone and rVWF+ADVATE is not inferior to 
theAUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats. 
ThePKcharacteristics of ADVATE were not affected by  co-administration of rVWF in 
cynomolgus monkey s. The P K data in the FVIII knock out mice model are inconclusive and 
might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII 
could be shown in a double knock -out model in a dose dependent manner.
2.2.1.4 Toxicology
Single dose toxi city studies were conducted in C57BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and 
cynomolgus monkey s. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . 
Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice
are not capable of sufficiently  cleaving the rVWF subunit as murine ADAMTS13 does 
notdecrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF (Varadi et al. 2009 ). The 
observed s ymptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated 
pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safety of repeated administration of rVWF with 
orwithout ADVATE (daily  over 14 day s) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent 
(cynomolgus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects 
(regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment
-related histopathologic changes in the 
heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U von Willebrand

serum chemistry  parameters, platelet aggregation, and gross pathology . rVWF combined with 
ADVATE was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey s after daily  IV (bolus) administration of 
100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF combined with 77 IU/kg ADVATE over a period of 14 day s. No 
adverse effects could be detected in this species. There were no signs of hemolysis, thrombosis, 
or thrombocy topenia after repeated IV application of rVWF with or without ADVATE. 
Therefore, 100 U VWF:RCo/kg/day  rVWF with or without 77 I U/kg ADVATE was considered 
the no observed adverse effect level in this study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti -drug 
antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in 
drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. These antibodies 
substantially  reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a si ngle 
dose administration. No adverse effects due to antibody  formation were observed in both 
species. rVWF combined with ADVATE was well tolerated locall y and no genotoxic potential 
was evident after 2 in vitro and 1 in vivo genotoxicity  study .
A study  on the influence of co- administration of VWF and ADVATE on the immunogenicit y of 
ADVATE in 3 different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 
hemophilic C57BL /6J mice, and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF 
does not ne gativel y impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE in an y of the 3 different hemophilic 
mouse models.
Please see Section 4of the IB for further details on non-clinical studies of rVWF.
2.2.2 Clinical Studies
2.2.2.1 Completed Studies
To date, the clinical development program consists of 5 completed trials of rVWF in VWD:
1.Phase 1 Study  070701, which investigated PK and tolerability  in patients with severe 
type 1, t ype 2, and t ype 3 VWD
2.Phase 3 Study  071001, which investigated the efficacy , safet y, and PK of rVWF in patients 
with severe VWD
3.Phase 3 Study  071401, which included a single subject who was in urgent need of rVWF 
due to anaph ylactic reactions to pdVWF
4.Phase 3 Study  071101, which investigated the safety  and efficacy  of rVWF in VWD 
patients undergoing elective surgical and invasive procedures.
5.Phase 3 Study  071301, investigating the efficacy  and safet y of proph ylaxis with rVWF in 
adult subjects with severe VWD

In addition, a Phase 1 study  (071104), which investigated the safet y of rVWF administered 
together with recombinant FVIII (rFVIII; ADVATE) in hemophilia A patients h as also been 
conducted.
The results of Phase 1 Study  070701 showed rVWF administered with rFVIII (ADVATE) at a 
ratio of 1.3:1 to be safe and well tolerated in adult patients with severe VWD up to the highest 
investigated dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo. The resul ts of the Phase 1 study  supported further 
evaluation of rVWF. The completed Phase 3 Study 071001 investigated the efficacy  and safet y 
of rVWF for the treatment of bleeding episodes when administered with ADVATE for the first 
infusion, and without ADVATE fo r the subsequent infusions (if needed) as long as hemostatic 
FVIII clotting activity  (FVIII:C) levels (>40%) were maintained. rVWF was shown to be safe 
and well tolerated. Most of the bleeds (81.8%) were controlled with 1 infusion of rVWF.
ThePK profile f or rVWF is comparable to plasma -derived VWF:FVIII (pdVWF:pdFVIII) 
concentrate with a tendency  toward a longer VWF:RCo half -life (T 1/2) and sustained stabilization 
of FVIII:C, obviating the need for additional rFVIII after the first infusion. rVWF was well 
tolerated in Study  071104 in subjects with hemophilia A. A slight trend was observed towards a 
higher T 1/2of rFVIII when administered together with 50 IU/kg rVWF, with the highest increase 
in rFVIII T 1/2in subjects with the lowest VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) ba seline levels. 
Study  071101 evaluated the efficacy  and safet y of rVWF with or without ADVATE in subjects 
with severe VWD undergoing major, minor, or oral elective surgical procedures. The study  
showed rVWF to be safe and well tolerated. Intra -and postope rative hemostasis were rated 
“excellent” or “good” for all treated subjects. As expected, postinfusion increases in 
concentrations of VWF:RCo, VWF:Ac, VWF:Ag, von Willebrand factor collagen binding 
activity  (VWF:CB), and FVIII:C were observed. The VWF:RCo activity  was consistent with that 
previously  observed in clinical studies (Study 071001 and Study 070701).
Study  071301 evaluated the efficacy  and safet y of prophylactic treatment with rVWF at a 
starting dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg twice weekl y in subjects with severe VWD. The study  showed 
rVWF to be safe and well tolerated. Prophy laxis with rVWF reduced the mean on -study  
spontaneous treated annualized bleeding rate (sABR) by  95% in subjects who switched from OD
with a VWF to proph ylactic treatment with rVWF (Prior OD subjects) and by  45% in subjects 
who switched from prophy laxis with plasma -derived VWF to rVWF prophy laxis (Switch 
subjects). Most (78.3%) subjects had zero treated spontaneous BEs while on rVWF proph ylaxis. 
FVIII activity  trough levels increased si gnificantly  for the Prior OD group from the initial 
assessment to the final assessment (geometric least squares [L S] means of 3.83 IU/dL  and 
18.7 IU/dL  at the initial and final assessments, respectivel y; p<0.0001). For the Switch group, 
trough levels of FV III activity  from the first PK/PD assessment (done after 5 to 6 infusions of

SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
rVWF) were similar to trough levels at study  completion (both assessments done at stead y state). 
Comparable dose -normalized C maxand AUC of FVIII activity  at steady  state, evaluated at 
different times during the study , were observed. For both the Prior OD and Switch groups, the 
VWF:RCo C maxremained stable throughout prophylactic treatment with rVWF.
No severe allergic reactions or neutralizing antibodies against rVWF or rFVIII hav e been 
observed during clinical development. One out of 100 VWD subjects treated with 
rVWF/vonicog alfa in clinical trials developed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the 
perioperative period after undergoing total hip replacement surgery .
Overall, the data support : a)the safet y and efficacy of rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII (ADVATE) for 
OD treatment and control of bleeding episodes as well as in perioperative management of 
surgery  related bleeding , and b)the efficacy  and safet y of rVWF when used for regular
prophy lactic treatment in adults diagnosed with VWD.
Please see Section 5 of the IB for further details on clinical studies of rVWF.
2.2.2.2 Ongoing Studies
One other Phase 3 stud y is ongoing: Phase 3 Study 071102, investigating the efficacy  and safet y
of rVWF in the treatment and control of bleeding episodes and in elective and e mergency  
surgeries, and the PK of rVWF in c hildren diagnosed with s evere VWD.
2.3Study Rationale
The purpose of this Phase 3b continuation study  is to evaluate the long -term safet y and 
hemostatic efficacy
 of rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophy laxis in adult and pediatric/adolescent (age 12 
to <18 y ears) subjects with severe VWD with the option of once weekly  dosing, and further 
assess the safety  and efficacy  of rVWF in OD treatment of bleeding episodes, and in 
perioperative management of surgical bleeding (if/when surgical treatment is required for a 
subject alread y participating in this study).
2.4Population to be Studied
Up to 71 pediatric /adolescent and adult subjects with severe VWD (including at least 5 newl y 
enrolled subjects with type 3 VWD on proph ylaxis regimen) will be included, composed of: a) 
up to 22 adult subjects transitioning from Stu dy 071301; b) up to 34 pediatric /adolescent subjects 
transitioning from Study  071102; c) at least 7 up to 15 newly enrolled adult and 
pediatric/adolescent (aged 12 to <18 y ears) subjects who have been receiving VWF products for 
OD treatment. Enrolled subjects (i.e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will 
be eligible to participate in the study  if they  meet all of the inclusion criteria (see Section 5.1) 
and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 5.2).

2.5Benefit/Risk Assessment 
The benefit for the individual subject is anticipat ed to outweigh the potential risks 
ofrVWF during this Phase 3b clinical study. Both adult and pediatric /adolescent (aged 12 to 
<18years) subjects may  benefit from aproduct that may  prevent bleeding episodes by  infusions 
at frequencies as lowasonce a weekand minimizes excessive FVIII administration.
Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variabilit y with respect to treating or 
preventing bleeds in VWD patients, especially  mucosal bleeds with unpredictable efficacy  
outcomes. The sponsor's rVWF product consistently  contains ultra -large von Willebrand Factor 
(ULVWF) multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13. The 
initial presence of these ULVWF multimers, which are subsequentl y cleaved by the 
patient’s endogenous ADAMTS13, may  result in improved platelet and collagen binding and 
may therefore carry  an increased risk of thrombosis. In contrast, these ULVWF multimers may  
provide more predict able treatment outcomes. By  using a recombinant product, the risk of 
contamination with blood- borne viruses or variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease associated with the 
use of products of human or animal origin has been virtually  eliminated. As with any  IV pro tein 
product, allergic -type hypersensitivity  reactions may  occur, as well as neutralizing antibodies to 
VWF.
In summary , the benefits outweigh the potential risks of rVWF administration at this stage of 
product development. The key  societal benefit is a be tter understanding of advanced treatment 
options for VWD patients undergoing surgical procedures and enhanced product availability .
Please refer to the IB for a detailed benefit /risk assessment of rVWF.
Alway s refer to the latest version of the rVWF IB for the overall benefit/risk assessment and the 
most accurate and current information regarding drug metabolism, PK, efficacy , and safety  of 
rVWF.

4.STUDY DESIGN
4.1Overall Design
This is a phase 3b, prospective, open -label, uncontrolled, non -randomized, multicenter study  
evaluating long -term safety  and efficacy  of rVWF (vonicog alfa) for prophylaxis and on- demand 
(OD) treatment of bleeding episodes in pediatric and adult subjects with severe VWD. The study  
plans to include cohorts as summarized below:
Prophy lactic treatment arm cohorts:
1. Adult subjects transitioning from the phase 3 Prophy laxis study  (Study  071301) who will 
remain on the same prophy lactic dose as in Study  071301
2.Adult subjects transitio
ning from Study  071301 with no clinically  significant bleeding 
episode for the past 6 months who will start this phase 3b study  at a lower dose/frequency  
compared to the dose received in Study  071301
3.Pediatric/adolescent subjects aged 12 to <18 years trans itioning from the phase 3 pediatric 
study  (Study  071102) who switch from receiving OD treatment to receiving once weekl y 
or twice weekl y proph ylaxis 
4.Newl y enrolled adult and pediatric/adolescent (aged 12 to <18 y ears)subjects switching 
from OD treatment 
with VWF products, starting once weekl y proph ylaxis with rVWF 
(vonicog alfa) in this phase 3b extension study
On-demand treatment arm cohorts:
5.Pediatric subjects of all ages from Study  071102 who will continue with receiving OD 
treatment 
6.Adult subjects fr om Study  071301 who will switch back from prophy lactic treatment to 
OD treatment
Adult subjects transitioning from Study  071301 who agree dto continue prophy lactic treatment 
were given an opportunity  to have their proph ylactic dose re-evaluated at the begi nning of this 
study ; if a subject experienced no bleeding episode over the last 6 months of their prophy lactic 
treatment in Study  071301, the subject might have beengiven a reduced dosage in this study  (at 
the discretion of the principal investigator base d on the detailed guidance provided in the 
protocol) (Cohort 2). Otherwise subjects continued with the prophy lactic treatment regimen from 
Study  071301 (Cohort 1), which was expected to be 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo twice weekl y for 
the majority  of subjects , at the beginning of this study .

SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
Pediatric/adolescent subjects aged 12 to <18 years transitioning from the pediatric study  071102 
who were considered eligible by  the investigator for switching to prophy laxis might have 
select edto go on proph ylactic treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa) (Cohort 3) at a dose of either 
50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo once weekl y or twice weekl y,based on the investigator's assessment 
and recommendation. Dosage might have beenindividualized within this range and, in 
consultation with the sponsor, increased up to 80 IU/kg if considered necessary  to assure 
effective proph ylaxis, based on: a) subject’s available historical PK data; b) ty pe and severity  of 
bleeding episodes the subject has experienced; c) monitor ing of appropriate clinical and 
laboratory  measures for the subject.
Newl y enrolled adult and pediatric/adolescent (aged 12 to <18 y ears)subjects (Cohort 4) will all 
be initially  assigned to a prophy lactic regimen of 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo once per week with 
rVWF (vonicog alfa) if they  are considered eligible and recommended by the investigator to 
receive proph ylacticregimen and they  choose to agree with the investigator’s recommendation. 
The starting dose, after consultation with the Sponsor, can be inc reased up to 80 I U/kg if 
considered necessary  to assure effective prophy laxis.
The remaining pediatric subjects (aged <18 years) from all age cohorts in Study 071102 who will 
not transition to prophy laxis and will cont inue to receive OD treatment (Cohort 5) and adult 
subjects from 071301 who were assigned (based on medical assessment and/or subject's 
individual preference) to switch back to OD regimen (Cohort 6) will receive rVWF (vonicog 
alfa) as OD treatment in this study . 
For all subjects on prophyla ctictreatment (Cohorts 1 to 4), dose and/or dose frequency  will be 
increased based on bleeding episode dose- escalation criteria (please refer to Section 6.2.2.1.2 in 
for dose escalation details).
For all cohorts, during the entire stud y observation period, an y bleeding episodes requiring 
substitution therapy  with VWF concentrate will be treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or 
without ADVATE (rFVIII, oc tocog alfa). If surgery  is needed, subjects will receive rVWF 
(vonicog alfa), with or without ADVATE (rFVIII,  octocog alfa), for management of 
perioperative bleeding; however, for pediatric subjects aged <18 years, if/when they  need 
surgical intervention/p rocedures during their participation in this study , the assessment whether 
they can be treated with the I P for the peri -operative management of bleeding requires 
consultation with the study medical monitors (also see Section 6.2.2.3) .
Once assigned, the cohort number of a subject will remain unchanged during the stud y. Change 
of treatment regimen will not result in switch of cohorts.

Minimum obse rvation time for this study  is 12 months and after this initial 12-month period, 
subjects will continue to be enrolled in the stud y until rVWF (vonicog alfa) is commerciall y 
available in their respective countries, or until subjects have been treated in th e study  for a 
maximum of 3 y ears, whichever occurs first. An interim anal ysis is planned once the subjects in 
the proph ylactic treatment arms complete the initial 12 months on study  treatment. Additional 
interim analy ses may  be performed as needed to suppo rt submissions to health authorities.
4.2Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The phase 3b extension/continuation study  with rVWF/vonicog alfa is designed to:
Explore additional doses/dose intervals for prophylaxis indication ( eg, once weekly dosing)
Allow for proph ylaxis in pediatric/adolescent subjects (Cohort 4)
Generate long term safety  and efficacy  data in adult and pediatric subjects
4.3Justification for Dose
Efficacy  of 40
-60 IU/kg for prophy lactic treatment was evaluated in adult VWD patients in a 
phase 3 study (071301) . Based on experience with plasma derived VWF products and the 
relativel y long MRT for rVWF, it is of significant interest and relevance to evaluate a wider 
dosing range, including once weekl y dosing.

4.7Study Stopping Criteria
This study  will be stopped if 1 or more of the following criteria are met in the absence of any  
other possible and medically  plausible causal attribution (e.g., underl ying or concurrent 
condition, use of concomitant medication, subjec t’s medical history , etc.):
1.Two subjects develop a life -threatening or fatal thromboembolic event 
2. Two subjects develop life-threatening or fatal severe h ypersensitivity  reactions 
(e.g., anaph ylaxis)
3.Any subject develops acute hepatic failure
4.Two subjects develop rVWF neutralizing antibodies that are considered clinically  
significant b y the investigators and are associated with significant decrease of efficacy or 
serious adverse reactions.
The study  may  be stopped at any  time by  the sponsor.
The sponsor ultimately  will decide whether to terminate, temporaril y halt or modify the stud y 
based on the data monitoring committee (DMC)’s review and recommendation on all relevant 
cases including those that meet the stopping criteria listed above.
4.8Global Health Eme rgencies and Clinical Trial Continuity
Global health emergencies, such as the COVID -19 pandemic, present significant logistical 
challenges for man y clinical sites around the world. Variable restrictions are being placed on site 
resources and operations and on an individual participant’s ability  to attend clinic visits. I n some 
places, medical visits are occurring, and in others, research clinics are operating with onl y 
emergency  staff.
Because of these challenges, additional measures and procedures may  need to be adopted to 
protect participant safet y and to ensure that participants do not experience gaps in the conduct of 
the study .
This protocol includes measures approved for implementation within this clinical trial to protect 
participant safety  and to ens ure the integrit y of the clinical trial, as a result of COVID -19 onl y. 
These measures may be implemented in accordance with any  requirements and expectations set 
out by  local Independent Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees and National 
Competent Au thorities, as necessary . In order to maintain the scientific integrity  of the study , 
and adhere to updated guidance from regulators, procedures have also been put into place to 
ensure that the actions taken to mitigate the impact of COVID- 19 are well docum ented in the 
trial database.

particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container 
permit. The reconstituted solution in the sy ringe should be clear, colorless and free from 
particles. It is not uncommon for a few flakes or particles to remain in the produc t vial after 
reconstitution. The filter included in the Mix2Vial device removes those particles completel y. 
Filtration does not influence dosage calculations. The solution filtered intothe sy ringe to be 
administered , should be clear and colorless in appea rance. If not, do not administer the product. 
Plastic sy ringes provided by  the sponsor must be used since coagulation factors tend to stick to 
the surface of glass s yringes.
Investigational product infusions should be given at a slow enough rate to ensure the subject’s 
comfort. The rate should not exceed 4 mL /minute. The investigator/ subject shall ensure that no 
visible residual volume remains in the sy ringe(s) and that the complete content is administered. 
Upon completion of the infusion, the butterfl y catheter should be flushed with at least 2 mL  of 
saline solution. I n case of a (central) venous access device, the flush should be with at least 
10mL of saline solution. The I P infusions should be administered over a duration of 2 to 
20minutes, depending o n the volume.
Only  the actual potencies of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) as stated 
on the vial labels and described in the Pharmacy  Manual should be used. A variation of up to 
10% of the intended dose for proph ylactic infusions and of the intended dose for treatment of 
bleeding episodes is permissible and the exact dose should be recorded on the Case Report Form 
(CRF). Using of partial vials can only  be allowed for pediatric subjects with a potential concern 
of exceeding the dose ran ge for stud y treatment per protocol .
At study  visits where recovery  anal ysis is being done, vials with the same lot numbers should be 
used throughout the PK IP infusion per subject.
For treatment of bleeding episodes, sequential administration will be done: separate s yringes of 
the appropriate dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and , if/when needed, ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog 
alfa) will be prepared for sequential infusion. rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be infused first 
sequentially  followed preferabl y within 10 minut es by  infusion of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog 
alfa). Onl y the actual potencies of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) as 
stated on the vial labels and described in the Pharmacy  Manual should be used.
If/when ADVATE use is considered necessary , the final dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa): ADVATE 
(rFV III, octocog alfa) should be at a ratio of (1.3± 0.2):1.
6.2.1 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment

b) Once weekl y 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo
based on the investigator's assessment and recommendation. Dosage may  be individualized 
within this range, in consultation with the sponsor, increased up to 80 IU/kg if considered 
necessary  to assure effective prophy laxis, based on:
subject’s available historical PK data
type and severity  of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced 
monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures for the subject
d.Cohort 4: Newly  enrolled adult and pediatric/adolescent (aged 12 to <18 years) subjects 
who: 
were previousl y treated with VWF products for bleeding episodes OD, with at least 
3 bleeding episodes (BE), excluding menorrhagia, that occurred over the past 
12months, and
are considered eligible for prophy lactic treatment based on the investigator's 
medical/clinical assessment 
will receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) once weekl y 50 (±10) IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Dosage may  be 
individualized within this range and, in consultation with the sponsor, increased up to 
80IU/kg if considered necessary to assure effective proph ylaxis, based on:
subject’s available historical PK data
type and severity  of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced 
monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory  measures for the subject
6.2.2.1.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment for Prophylaxis
At the discretion of the investigator, a subject may be considered suitable for home treatment 
only after the subject has received at least 1 infusion of IP in the clinic, either during planned 
prophy lactic IP exposure or during the treatment of bleeding episodes, and meets the following 
additional criteria:
1.Fully  understands the concept of a clinical study  and related documentation (documented 
training of at least 30 minutes),
2.Has a history  of previous experience with home treatment including self- administration 
and treatment with VWF containing concentrates,

3.Has adequate time for initial training of the stud y drug preparation (preparation, mixing 
and infusion of the IP(s) (documented training of at least 30 minutes).
This applies both to subjects who were on prior OD treatment and to subjects rolling over from 
adult prophy laxis regimen. I n the event a healthcare professional is required to administer I P,
he/she must be trained and qualified by  the investigator on the above procedures prior to the 
decision for home treatment. 
Subjects who receive home treatment may  receive I P through a direct -to-patient (DTP) process, 
and the site will follow-up with the subject or, for pediatric subjects, the subject’s parent(s) or 
legally  authorized representative. When utilizing DTP, the investigator remains responsible for 
ensuring the safety  of subjects and the dispensation of the I P. A Subject Guideline detailing all
instructions and information listed above will be provided to each subject.
6.2.2.1.2 Dose Escalation
For all subjects on prophy laxis, if escalation criteria are ever met during the study , dose 
escalation , per protocol, will be performed. Dose escalations (not exce eding the upper limit of 80 
IU/kg rVWF:RCo per dose) and increase of dose frequency  will only  be allowed in case of 
insufficient therapeutic response with breakthrough bleeding episodes. The criteria for dose 
and/or frequency  escalation are specific to eac h bleeding location but, in general, involve one 
significant breakthrough bleeding episode despite the subject being compliant with scheduled 
prophy lactictreatment. For subjects who require a dose escalation due to a breakthrough bleed, 
preferentiall y, the frequency  should be kept the same but the dose (IU/kg VWF:RCo per 
infusion) should be increased up to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo. Based on the subject's bleeding history, 
the investigator' clinical judgement and the pharmacokinetic data (if available), dose escala tion 
by increasing the dose frequency  should be considered. An y increase in dose or dose frequency  
should be done in consultation with the Sponsor. Table 12presents the criteria for dosing 
escalation per each bleeding location. 
All dose adjustments need to be done in consultation with the sponsor .

If a subject does not adequately  respond to rVWF (vonicog alfa) therapy , he/she will be 
evaluated for the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti- VWF antibodies (see 
Section 8.4.3.13.1 ). If a subject experiences a bleed while receiving rVWF (voni cog alfa) 3 times 
per week, the investigator should treat the bleed with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at doses up to 80 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg at a frequency  determined by  the investigator until the bleed resolves. Upon 
resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will ret urn to their assigned prophy laxis regimen. It 
is essential for the success of this study  that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens. Therefore, 
procedures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 6.5). If 
oneinfusion of I P is missed, the subject may  administer the I P as soon as possible. The subject 
should adhere to their treatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this 
and the previous IP infusion. For example, if a subject routinely  infuses IP on Monday  and 
Thursday , in the case he/she misses the Monday  time point, he/she may  infuse the I P on the next 
day (Tuesday ) and thereafter, proceed with infusi ng the IP on Thursday  (considering a minimum 
12 hours between the infusions) and then return to the initial schedule. If more than 30% of 
infusions of I P are missed within the visit interval of 3 months the subject will be discontinued 
from the study  (see Section 7.2).Any foreseeable or unforeseeable changes to the planned 
prophy lactic dosing regimen due to COVID -19 related constraints should be 
communicated /reported to the Sponsor and study  teams as soon as possible.
6.2.2.2 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes
If an acute bleeding episode occurs, the subject will be treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or 
without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa). It is the sponsor’s opinion that, in many  cases, 
treatment with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) may  not be necessary , since rVWF (vonicog 
alfa) proph ylaxis will serve to increase endogenous FVIII levels. However, if end ogenous FVIII 
is below 30% or is unknown and cannot be estimated from the subject’s PK study, an infusion of 
rVWF: ADVATE at an rVWF: ADVATE ratio of (1.3± 0.2) : 1 should be administered initially . 
Subsequent infusions should be with rVWF:RCo 40 to 60 I U/kg with or, in many  cases, without

rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
ADVATE ( 30 to 45 IU/kg , only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/L 
during the treatment period). Dosing may  be adjusted downward or upward up to 80 IU/kg 
rVWF at the treating ph ysician’s discretion based upon the subject’s prior history , PK and other 
factors. If FVIII levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon 
the individual subject’s PK data. Using ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in addition to rVWF 
(vonicog a lfa) in subsequent doses carries the risk of an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, 
reduced doses of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and/or prolongation of the dose interval 
should be considered.
The following is general guidance and the sponsor’s suggesti on for treatment of breakthrough 
bleeds, however , each principal investigator (PI) will determine the treatment based on the local 
acceptable practice how to monitor and adjust treatment for a bleeding episode. An effort should 
be made to discuss with the sponsor (or sponsor’s delegate) the treatment strategy .
In general, the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels 
of >0.6 IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of >0. 3 IU/mL ( 30%). In major bleeding episodes, subsequent 
doses should k eep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessary  
by the investigator for subsequent day s. In moderate bleeding episodes, the dose and trough level 
may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary  by the investigator. Treat
ment for 
minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of only  1 or 2 doses of rVWF (vonicog alfa) I P. If 
the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by  at least 12 hours; 
if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by  at least 
24hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. 
Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 13.

BW = body weight; CNS = central nervous system; GI = gastrointestinal: IU = international unit; 
VWD = von Willebrand disease; VWF:RCo = von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor 
a Menorrhagia is defined as excessive bleeding during menstruation. A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined 
by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >185 and normal cervical 
cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment o f excessive menstrual bleeding for at 
least one menstrual cycle during the prior year.
Dosage and frequency must be individualized based on the subject’s weight, VWD ty pe and 
severit y of bleeding episode and monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory  measures. In 
general, an initial dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg VWF:RCo is recommended. Depending on the 
subject’s baseline FVIII level, rVWF should be given with or without 30 to 45 IU/kg ADVATE 
(rFV III, octocog alfa) (rVWF: rFVIII ratio of 1.3± 0.2 : 1). I n cases of major bleeding episodes, a 
dose of up to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may  be infused. If necessary , subsequent doses of 40 to 
60IU/kg VWF:RCo will be administered every 8 to 24 hours with or without ADVATE [rFVIII, 
octocog alfa] (only to be administer ed if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/dL during the 
treatment period) to maintain VWF:RCo and FVIII levels for as long as deemed necessary  by the 
investigator.
In the phase 1 stud y 070701, 1.0 IU/kg VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by  
0.017 IU/mL  (1.7 %). In the same study , the observed mean T1/2 for rVWF (vonicog alfa) was 
19.3 hours, with a standard deviation of 10.9 hours.
Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but
especiall y for the pe diatric subjects, rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided.
Subjects with non
-neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially  be treated with a 
dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history  which may  differ 
from the recommendations provided in Table 13. Subjects should be monitored for lack of 
efficacy  as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (mandatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where 
testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6 hours. Re -
dosing with rVWF (vonicog alfa) in 
combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) using the same (initial) dose and adaptation 
of the dosing frequency  should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or 
VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% de pending on bleeding severit y. The number of 
subsequent infusions and the dosage levels prescribed will be determined by the investigator on 
the basis of the clinical severit y, response to current therap y, available laboratory  data, and the 
subject’s histor
ical treatment for similar bleeding episodes.

6.2.2.2.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment for Bleeding Episodes
If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study  site immediately  
andthe site investigator should provide instructions on the treatment regimen .
If the subject initiates the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study  site 
if a visit is needed as per the standard of care at the center. In the event a healthcare professional 
is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y 
the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. Once a 
subject has received 1 infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in the clinic (either during plan ned IP 
exposure or during the treatment of a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home 
treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see 
Section 6.2.2.1.1 ).
If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions must be 
administered at the stud y site or, due to extraordinary  circumstances such as COVID -19,by other 
healt h-care providers who are informed/trained about the study  treatment and I P administration 
specifics .
If a roll-over subject experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the 
screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit, the subject will be treated with IP (rVWF with or 
without ADVATE). Treatment with I P must occur at the study  site unless the subject has 
previously  qualified for home treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa). If rVWF (vonicog alfa) 
treatment is not feasible, the subject may  use his/her standar d of care, such as commercial 
pdVWF/FVIII products. If a new subject screened for eligibility  for Cohort 4 experiences a 
bleeding episode that requires VWF treatment between the screening and the prophy laxis 
initiation visit, the subject will be treated with his/her standard of care, such as commercial 
pdVWF/FVIII p roducts. 
For Cohort 4 subjects, a washout period of at least 5 day s is required prior to rVWF (vonicog 
alfa) PK infusion at the PK assessment visit. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode 
requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be used to treat the 
bleed. Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated 
once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of an y symptoms related with the bleeding 
episode. Dose and frequency  of rVWF ( vonicog alfa) infusions or an y other replacement therap y 
to stop the bleed should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF), and the reason 
for the use of an y non -IP product or therap y should be documented.

6.2.2.3 Management of Perioperative Bleeding
Subjects enrolled in this study  who require surgery  or dental procedures will be treated with IP to 
manage their surgical bleeding then afterwards will resume their prophy lactic rVWF (vonicog 
alfa) treatment schedule. Pediatric and adolescent subjects who completed Study  071102 and 
enrolled in this study  to continue receiving on- demand treatment with rVWF or adolescent 
subject(s) enrolled in this study  to start receiving prophy lactic treatment with rVWF will be 
treated with IP to manage surgery /procedure re lated bleeding if/when they  require surgical, 
invasive or oral/dental procedures if their corresponding age cohort in Study  071102 has been 
opened to allow enrollment of surgery  subjects for the ty pe of surgery /procedure (minor or oral, 
or major surgeries) required in this study . If the corresponding age cohort in Study 071102 has 
not been opened for the ty pe of surgery  required in this study  for pediatric/adolescent subjects, 
the subject should be treated with standard of care therapies as concomitant trea tment. New 
subjects who have an alread y scheduled surgical intervention at the time of screening for 
Cohort 4, are not eligible for participation in the study .
Major, Minor and Oral Surgery Definition:
The following definitions and criteria are used to ser ve as a guidance for major, minor and oral 
surgery .
Major surgeries generally refer to major orthopedic surgery  (e.g., joint replacement, arthroscopic 
or open s ynovectom y, arthrodesis, hardware removals like plates or intramedullary  nails, etc.), 
major abdominal surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic hernioplast y, cholecy stectomy , colon or 
small bowel resection, etc.), major gy necological surgery  (e.g. open or laparoscopic 
myomectom y, hysterectomy , removal of endometriosis, poly ps, cy sts, adhesioly sis, etc.), m ajor 
head and neck surgery  (e.g.: tonsillectomy , adenoidectomy , rhinoplasty , lymphadenectom y, 
thyroidectomy, parotidectomy . etc.), an y intracranial, cardiovascular or spinal surgery and an y 
other surgery  which has a significant risk of large volume blood l oss or blood loss into a 
confined anatomical space. Extraction of impacted third molars is generall y also considered 
major surgery  due to the expected difficult y of surgery and the expected blood loss.
Minor surgeries generally refer to interventions such as placement of IV access devices, removal 
of small skin lesions, arthroscop y, gastroscop y, colonoscopy  or conization.
Oral surgeries comprise extractions of fewer than 3 teeth, if the teeth are non -molars and have 
no bony  involvement.
A summary  schedule of visit assessments is included in Table 4and Table 8.

rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
The dose and frequency  of administration of rVWF will be individualized based on the t ype of 
surgery , PK results, and VWF and FVIII levels. In general, the dose will be tailored to raise the
VWF:RCo concentration to 100% of normal for major surgeries, and to 50 to 60% of normal for 
minor and oral surgeries.
For subjects undergoing elective surgery , an rVWF priming dose is to be infused 12 to 24 hours 
prior to surgery  in subjects with inadequa te levels of FVIII, to allow the endogenous FVIII levels 
to increase to at least 30 IU/dL  (for minor and oral surgery ) or 60 IU/dL (for major surgery ) 
before the loading dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa).
For both elective and emergency  surger y, an rVWF loading dose should be administered within 
3 hours prior to surgery . ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) may  be administered in addition to 
rVWF (vonicog alfa) in order to raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels.
If not assessed prior to the preoperative priming dose , an IR may  be calculated for subjects 
undergoing minor and oral surgery . The preoperative loading dose will be calculated as the 
difference in the target peak and baseline plasma VWF:RCo levels divided by  the IR 
(ΔVWF:RCo x BW (kg) /I R). The PK results will be provided prior to the planned surgery . If the 
IR is not available, assume an IR of 1.7 IU/dL per IU/kg and calculate the initial dose as follows: 
(100 –baseline plasma VWF:RCo) x BW (kg) / 1.7. For minor and oral surgery , the IR from the 
Preoperative Priming Dose visit will be used to guide dosing. As a general guidance, a loading 
dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo should be administered. ADVATE, at a dose of 30 to 
45IU/kg may  be infused sequentially , preferabl y within 10 minutes after the rVWF infusio n in 
subjects whose FVIII plasma levels alread y are (or are highl y likel y to be) less than 40 to 
50IU/dL  for minor/oral surgery  or 80 to 100 IU/dL for major surgery  before the initiation of the 
surgery . At the discretion of the Investigator, the ADVATE do se may  be increased in subjects 
requiring emergency  surgery  who did not receive a preoperative priming dose.
The peri - and postoperative substitution regimen will be individualized according to PK results; 
intensity  and duration of the hemostatic challenge ; and the institution’s standard of care. Dosing 
should be guided b y the dosing recommendations and continued until healing is achieved. 
Subjects undergoing minor surgery  will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every  12-24 hours 
or every  other day , target ing ≥30IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII) for at least the first 48 hours. Subjects 
undergoing oral surgery  will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at least once within the first 
8-12 hours, targeting ≥30 IU/dL  (rVWF and FVIII). Subjects undergoing major surgery  will be 
infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every  12-24 hours for at least the first 72 hours post -surgery , 
targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level >50 IU/dL, followed by  further treatment 
post-72 hours for as long as deemed necessary  by the I nvestiga tor, targeting a VWF:RCo and 
FVIII:C trough plasma level of 
≥30 IU/dL. Dose modifications based on pre- infusion

VWF/FVIII levels will be performed as needed. For subsequent infusions post -surgery , in case 
pre-infusion levels are not available prior to the consecutive infusion in a timely manner, 
pre-infusion levels from the previous dose may  be used by  the investigator for dosing guidance.
6.2.2.4 PK Assessment
For subjects in Cohort 4, the PK dose is 50 (±5) IU/kg rVWF:RCo for the initial PK assessment 
at the begi nning of the study . Additionall y, subjects in Cohorts 1 -4 will undergo stead y state PK 
assessment at the EOS, and the PK dose is their last scheduled proph ylactic dose.

min/max t hermometer) would require manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor must 
be notified immediately  upon discovery  of any  excursion from the established range. 
Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The spo nsor 
will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the investigational product and will provide 
supportive documentation as necessary . Under nocircumstances should the product be dispensed 
to subjects until the impact has been determined and the pro duct is deemed appropriate for use 
by the sponsor.
The sponsor should be notified immediately  if there are an y changes to the storage area of the 
investigational product that could affect the integrity  of the product(s), e.g., fumigation of a 
storage room.
6.3.4 Special Handling
Before administration, the reconstituted product has to be brought to room temperature. Storage 
of rVWF post -reconstitution should be limited to 3 hours at room temperature. 
In case large volumes of rVWF are required, it is possible to p ool not more than 2 vials of rVWF 
together. The contents of each reconstituted product can be drawn in a single sy ringe.
The rVWF FDP (dosage strength: 650 VWF:RCo IU per vial) is reconstituted with a sterile 
water for injection (SWFI) with a nominal volum e of 5 mL  and a minimum extractable volume 
of 5 mL .
The rVWF FDP (dosage strength  1300 VWF:RCo IU per vial) is reconstituted with a sterile 
water for injection (SWFI) with a nominal volume of 10 mL  (minimum extractable volume of 
10mL). The SWFI is manufactured b y Siegfried Hameln GmbH (Germany).
The ADVATE FDP (dosage strength: 500 IU per vial and 1000 IU per vial) is reconstituted with 
a sterile water for injection (SWFI) with a nominal volume of 2 mL  (minimum extractable 
volume of 2 mL ).
If ADVATE is needed in addition to rVWF, sequential administration will be done with rVWF 
being infused first. Mixing of rVWF and ADVATE is not permitted.

DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL
7.1Discontinuation of Study Treatment
If investigational product is discontinued, regardless of the reason, the evaluations listed for End 
of Study  Visit will be performed as completely  as possible. Whenever possible, all discontinued 
subjects should also undergo the protocol -specified evaluations at EOS Visit. Comments 
(spontaneous or elicited) or complaints made b y the subject must be recorded in the source 
documents. The reason for discontinuation, date of di scontinuation of the investigational product, 
and the total amount of investigational product administered must be recorded in the source 
documents.
Subjects who discontinue will not be replaced.
7.2Reasons for Discontinuation 
The reason for discontinuation must be determined by  the investigator and recorded in the 
subject’s source document. I f a subject is discontinued for more than 1 reason, each reason 
should be documented in the source and the most clinically  relevant reason should be indicated. 
Reasons for discontinuation include, but are not limited to:
Adverse event
Protocol deviation
Withdrawal by  subject
Lost to follow -up
Lack of efficacy
Other (eg, pregnancy )
Additionally , the investigator and sponsor have the discretion to discontinue any  subject from the 
study  if, in their judgment, continued participation would pose an unacceptable risk for the 
subject.
If a subject is withdrawn from study  participation due to personal concerns related to public 
health emergenc ies such as COVID -19 (other than an AE related to the emergency), this should 
be specified as the reason for subject withdrawal in the eCRF. Investigators should use the 
“Other” discontinuation reason and specify  the relation to the public health emergency . Any

for the following reasons:
1. The subject is scheduled for an extended treatment period >3 months with non- topical 
immunomodulating drugs other than anti -retroviral chemotherap y (e.g., α -interferon, 
corticosteroid agents [equivalent t o hydrocortisone greater than 10 mg/day]) during the 
course of the stud y.
2. Subjects with chronic hepatitis B or C develop ALT/AST levels exceeding 5 times the 
upper limit of normal (ULN) for >1 month.
3.Subjects who experience severe h ypersensitivity  reaction s, e.g., anaph ylaxis upon exposure 
to rVWF (vonicog alfa).
4.Subjects who develop a neutralizing inhibitor to rVWF (vonicog alfa) and/or ADVATE 
(rFV III, octocog alfa) (biological assay s) that results in significant clinical effect, including 
but not limited to increasing the weekl y dose of rVWF by >50%.
5. Subjects who demonstrate clinical signs of thromboembolic events.
6. The subject becomes pregnant. IP exposure will be discontinued. Attempts will be made to 
follow the subject through completion of the pregnancy and up to 1 year post delivery , if 
feasible. The investigator will record a narrative description of the course of the pregnancy  
and its outcome.
7.The subject begins lactating. IP exposure will be discontinued. The investigator will record 
a narrative desc ription of the course of the bab y’s development.
8.The subject is not compliant with the prophy lactic treatment regimen and does not adhere 
to the frequency  of IP administration. Once >30% of infusions are missed within a visit 
interval (3 months), the subje ct will be discontinued from further participation in the study .
9.The subject repeatedl y uses other VWF products for proph ylaxis or for the treatment of 
bleeding episodes in the absence of an acceptable justification to the sponsor.
10. Withdrawal from the Study
A subject may  withdraw from the study  at any  time and for an y reason without prejudice to 
his/her future medical care b y the ph ysician or at the institution, or may  be withdrawn at an y 
time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor (e.g., in the i nterest of subject safet y). The 
investigator is encouraged to discuss withdrawal of a subject with the medical monitor when 
possible.

A minimum of 3 documented attempts must be made to contact any subject who is lost to 
follow -up at an y time point prior to the last scheduled contact (office visit or telephone contact). 
At least 1 of these documented attempts must include a written communication sent to the 
subject’s last known address via courie r or mail (with an acknowledgement of receipt request) 
asking that the subject return to the site for final safety  evaluations and return any  unused 
investigational product.

8.STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
8.1Informed Consent and Enrollment
Prior to performi ng an y trial assessments that are not part of routine medical care for the subject, 
the investigator will obtain written informed consent as described in Appendix 1.5 . Any  patient 
who provides informed consent (i.e., signs and dates the informed consent form (I CF)) is 
considered a subject enrolled in the study .
8.2Subject Identification Code (SIC)
The following series of numbers will comprise the SI C: protocol identifier (e.g., 071304) to 
beprovided b y the sponsor, 2- or 3-digit number study  site number (e.g., 02) to be provided 
bythe sponsor, and 3- or 4-digit subject number (e.g., 0003) reflecting the order o f enrollment 
(i.e., signing the informed consent form). For example, the third subject who signed an informed 
consent form at stud y site 02 will be identified as Subject 071304 -020003. All study  documents 
(e.g., CRFs, clinical documentation, sample contain ers, drug accountability  logs, etc.) will be 
identified with the SI C. Additionally , a uniquel y coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not 
contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e.g., collection of a 
subject’s in itials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data 
privacy .
8.3Study Schedule
The overall study  design is illustrated in Figure 1andFigure 2. Details on the procedures to be 
performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in
 Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, 
Table 5,Table 6and  Table 7. Study  assessments are detailed in Section 8.4.
In acknowledgement of hospital, local, state, or national government restrictions or other site 
related factors caused b y unavoidable circumstances (eg, COVID -19 pandemic) which may  
prevent Investigators from conducting the stud y according to the Schedule of Assessments at the 
clinical study  site, Investigators may  seek approval from the Medical Monitor(s) to continue 
subjects in the study  despite departure from the Schedule of Assessments. I nvestigators are 
expected to evaluate the impact to the safet y of the study  participants and site personnel for 
subjects to continue the study  assessments/procedures as previously  planned and consider 
rescheduling/replanning of the visits and assessments/p rocedures in consultation with the study  
Medical Monitor(s). In evaluating such requests, the Medical Monitor(s) will give the highest 
priority  to the safet y and wellbeing of the subjects. For subjects that are impacted, an y 
procedures not conducted per th e original stud y plan will be documented in the study  records 
including the cause for the change(s) made.

When approval is given for a subject to miss an in- person stud y visit, a study site ph ysician will 
speak directly  with the subject, or if applicable, the subject’s parent(s)/legally  authorized 
representative(s) b y telephone or other medium (eg, a computer- based video communication) 
during each visit window to assess subject’s safet y and overall clinical status. During this 
contact, the stud y site physic ian or other qualified site staff should also, at a minimum, conduct 
the following assessments: AE collection, concomitant medication documentation. Other study  
assessments may  be performed remotel y as applicable, and may  involve audio or video 
recording. Additionall y, sites may send site staff to subjects’ residences to conduct study  
assessments contingent upon local regulations. Assessments that cannot be completed during the 
protocol specified window will be considered missing data, such departures will be recorded in 
the study  records including the reason for the missed assessment and will be considered protocol 
deviations. Alternativel y, sites may  seek approval to extend the visit window in order to conduct 
an on -site visit.
8.3.1 Screening Visit 
In order to thoroughl y assess a potential subject’s condition and ability to fully  compl y with the 
requirements of the protocol, a joint pre- screening medical evaluation of potential subjects shall 
be conducted b y the Investigator and the Study Medical Monitors (incl uding Sponsor’s and 
CRO’s Medical Monitors) prior to performing an y screening tests and/or procedures. One aspect 
of this pre -screening medical evaluation is to assess the overall condition of patients with respect 
to the required blood volume to be collec ted for the test samples necessary for screening and 
baseline (including PK) assessments and procedures. General recommendations provided in the 
review article published by  The Bulletin of the World Health Organization (Howie 2011 )will be 
taken into account as well as the guidelines b y the Investigator’s institution and other parameters 
pertaining to each individual patient under consideration for screening, to ensure patient safet y 
and compliance with the criteria provided in this protocol and the stud y consent forms. A 
summary  of the discussion/pre -screening medical evaluation including Study  Medical Monitors’ 
signatures will be documented b y the CRO’s Study Medical Monitor.
To initiate screening procedures, at least 72 hours must have elapsed since the last VWF 
administration, and the subject must not be actively  bleeding at the time of screening. The 
screening visit will be delay ed if the subjects presents with an ac ute bleeding episodes or acute 
illness (e.g. influenza, flulike sy mptoms, inflammatory  diseases) until the event has resolved. All 
screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility shall take place within 42 day s prior to the 
first infusion of I P. If th e IP is not infused within 42 day s, all screening assessments except blood 
group, genetics, multimeric pattern and HRQoL, must be repeated to reconfirm eligibility . Upon 
completion of screening procedures, subject eligibility  will be confirmed by  the sponsor on a 
subject eligibility  form before additional study  procedures are undertaken. The subject will 
receive an e -diary  at the beginning of their study participation that will include IP infusion logs

(including the regular prophy lactic treatment infusions) , bleeding episodes and treatment, AEs, 
concomitant medications and treatments
,and patient reported outcomes (including qualit y of life 
and health resource use data) . Multimer anal ysis and VWD gene mutation anal ysis should be 
performed at screen ing if not available in the subject’s medical history . If multimer analy sis and 
VWD gene mutation analy sis cannot be performed at screening , given the subject meets all 
eligibility  criteria, these assessments may  be performed during the subject’s participa tion in the 
study  and as soon as possible.
The study  site is responsible for maintaining a screening and enrollment log that includes all 
subjects who provided informed consent/assent. The log also will serve to document the reason 
for screening failure. I f a subject does not satisfy  all screening criteria, the same subject may  be 
re-screened at a later date. A complete or partial re -screen may  also become necessary  at the 
discretion of the investigator or sponsor. All screening data will be collected and r eported in 
CRFs, regardless of screening outcome. For the purpose of analy sis, onl y the data from the most 
recent screening visit will be used. If a subject is re -screened, the End of Study  CRF should be 
completed, and a new ICF, new SIC, and new CRF are r equired for that subject.
Subjects who fail screening due to a single laboratory  test result which does not meet eligibility  
criteria may  have that laboratory  test repeated at the discretion of the Investigator. This will 
include a repeat of onl y the faile d assessment; complete rescreening will not be necessary . In 
these cases, a new SIC is not required, the subjects will maintain their original SI C. The repeat of 
a screening value is allowed once. A repeat assessment must take place within 42 day s of the 
initial screening for any subject requiring repeat of a screening assessment. If this timeframe is 
exceeded, then all screening assessments must be repeated and the subject assigned a new SIC.
Subjects transitioning from 071301 or 071102 can use the end of study  assessments in their 
previous rVWF stud y for screening visit assessments in this extension study. An y additional 
required screening assessments will be performed the same day. Therefore, whenever possible 
the Screening visit should coincide with the EOS visit of the previous rVWF study . However, if 
this is not possible, a small gap between the Screening visit and the EOS of the prior study may 
be allowed upon consultation with the Sponsor. Subjects’ eligibility  should be confirmed no later 
than 42 days after the end of study  visit in their prior study ,which is to also serve as the 
continuatio nstudy ’s screening visit. Additionally , transitioning subjects will receive the first 
prophy lactic IP treatment either as part of the IR determination of the EOS visit of the previous 
rVWF study  (when the Screening visit coincides with the EOS visit of the prior study ) or at the 
screening visit of this continuation study  (when the 2 visits are not on the same day ).
For the 
transitioning /roll-over subjects from stu dies 071102 and 071301 , in the event of a subject 
experiencing a bleeding episode that requires factor replacement treatment between the screening

visit and the subsequent visit, the subject will be treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa). If rVWF 
(vonicog alfa) is not available for an y reason, (e.g.,  study  site visit for I P administration not 
feasible, IP not available due to extraordinary  circumstances s uch as COVID -19, etc. )the subject 
may use standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products, and the reason for the use 
of non
-IP products should be clearly documented.
For newly  enrolled subjects in Cohort 4, in the event of a subject experiencin g a bleeding 
episode that requires factor replacement treatment between the screening visit and the subsequent 
visit (ie ,initial PK assessment/baseline visit), the subject will be treated with his/her standard of 
care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII produ cts, and the reason for the use of non- IP products 
should be clearl y documented.
8.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Assessment -Initial PK (Cohort 4 only)
Subjects in Cohort 4 will complete the initial PK assessment as shown in Table 3and Table 7. 
After screening and confirmation of eligibility , subjects will undergo
a PK assessment. PK 
assessment is to be performed following a washout period of at least 5 days. The subject should 
not be activel y bleeding at the time of PK assessment. Subjects will receive a dose of 
50(±5) IU/kg rVWF:RCo to determine VWF and FVIII activities. Blood samples will be drawn 
within 30 minutes pre- infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion (15 [±5] minutes, 
30[±5] minutes, 60 [±5] minutes, 3 [±0.5] hours, 6 [±0.5] hours, 12 [±0.5] hours (can be 
performed at 10 [±1] hours for the subject’s convenience), 24 [±0.5] hours, 30 [±2] hours, 
48[±2] hours, 72 [±2] hours, and 96 [±2] hours). Samples for measurement of FVIII and VWF 
activity  taken through to 6 hours post -infusion will be obtained from an extremity  different from 
that used for the infusion of I P. Where needed, the phlebotomy  site will be kept patent via an 
infusion of normal saline. I n this event, at least 5 mL  of blood will be collected and discarded 
before collection of the next test sample into a fresh sy ringe.
If the subject has a central venous catheter, the central line should be used to administer the 
infusion and a peripheral venipuncture should be used to collect the blood samples. In the event 
that a blood sample must be drawn through the central line used for administrat ion of I P, the line 
must first be flushed with at least 10 mL  normal saline or other suitable catheter flush solution 
that does not contain anticoagulant. At least 5 mL of whole blood must be collected and 
discarded prior to obtaining the sample.
If a subj ect experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening and the 
PK infusion with the I P for Initial PK assessment visit and the subject is treated with his/her 
standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products, a washout pe riod of at least 5 day s 
is required prior to rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK infusion at the PK assessment visit. I f a subject 
experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF (vonicog

alfa) should be used to treat the bleed and no subsequent blood sample will be drawn in that 
specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 6.2.2 has to be followed for the treatment 
of the bleeding episode. Once recovered, the subject is eligible to repeat the PK assessment.
8.3.3 Prophylaxis Initiation Visit (Cohort 1, Cohort 2, Cohort 3, and Cohort 4)
The proph ylaxis initiation visit will occur within 42 day s after screening and upon confirmati on 
of eligibility . For subjects transitioning from Study  071301 and 071102 to Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 in 
this study , the prophy laxis initiation visit is expected to be on the same day  of screening visit 
unless approved b y the Sponsor under special circumstances (eg, COVID -19). For new subjects 
in Cohort 4, t he last post -infusion laboratory  assessments coincide with the initiation visit for 
prophy lactic treatment. After the blood samples are drawn for laboratory  assessment for the 
96-hr post-infusion PK assessmen t, the subject receives the first IP infusion for proph ylactic 
treatment (proph ylaxisinitiation visit). The 96 -
hrpost-infusion PK sampling should be 
conducted on the same day  along with the drawing of prophy laxis pre -infusion sample (Table 7). 
Details on dose are provided in Section 6.2.2.1 .
8.3.4 Follow -Up Study Visits
Visits will be performed after the proph ylaxis initiation visit at 1 month (±1) week, 2 months 
(±1) week and 3 months (±2) weeks and thereafter every  3 months (±2) weeks for subjects in 
Cohort 1, Cohort 2, Cohort 3, and Cohort 4. Fol low-up (FU) study  visits for subjects in 
ODtreatment arm (Cohort 5 and Cohort 6) will be performed at every  3 months (±2) weeks after 
screening. Additional visits may  occur if clinicall y indicated (see Section 8.3.5 )
. When possible, 
site visits should be scheduled on day s when the subject s in Cohorts 1-4 are expected to infuse 
planned proph ylactic rVWF (vonicog alfa). Within 2 hours prior to the prophy lactic rVWF 
(vonicog alfa) IP infusion, a phy sical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed 
within 30 minutes prior to I P infusion and 30 minutes ± 15 minutes after IP infusion. I R will be 
determined at each FUvisit (until the 12 -month visit) based on VWF:RCo activity  assessed prior 
to and after IP infusion. Immunogenicit y will be assessed quarterly throughout the study at the 
scheduled FUvisits, or, during unscheduled visits, if sampling for immunogenicity assessment 
cannot be pe rformed during scheduled visits due to special circumstances.
The blood sample for IR anal ysis will be drawn within 30 minutes prior to IP infusion and 
30minutes ± 5 minutes after IP infusion. rVWF (vonicog alfa) will be infused at the regular 
prophy lactic dose. For each subject’s recovery  analy sis IP infusion, vials from the same lot 
number should be used. Testing for VWF:RCo VWF:CB, rVWF:Ag, and FVIII:C level will be 
performed using the blood sample obtained before and after I P infusion. 
The blood sample prior to I P infusion will also be used for the assessment of neutralizing and 
binding antibodies, clinical chemistry  and hematology . For OD subjects, a washout period of at

rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
least 72 hours after the last infusion applies before the blood draw for the imm unogenicit y 
assay s.For subjects receiving regular proph ylactic treatment in Cohorts 1- 4, if an I P infusion is 
administered (for an y reason, including treatment of a breakthrough bleed or a delay ed planned 
prophy lactic infusion) after the last scheduled prophy lactic infusion and before the scheduled FU 
visit during which the next scheduled prophy lactic infusion would be expected to be 
administered, the FU visit should be rescheduled for proper pre -infusion sampling to be 
performed for assessment of neutralizing and binding antibodies, clinical chemistry  and 
hematology .
The evaluation of IP consumption and treatment compliance will be performed based on 
subject’s diary  entries. If a subject is not compliant with the prophy lactic tr eatment regimen and 
does not adhere to the required frequency  of administration of I P infusions (>30% of infusions 
were missed within a visit interval [3 months]) the subject will be withdrawn from the study .
At the 6 months ± 2 weeks and 12 months ± 2 wee ks visits an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be 
performed and PRO data will be collected.
For the hemostatic efficacy  assessment, the following information will be recorded b y the subject 
in the patient diary : bleeding location, t ype, severity, onset and reso lution date and time, infusion 
date and time, clinical efficacy  according to the rating scale. If at any  time during the study  a 
subject’s bleeding episode does not adequatel y respond to rVWF (vonicog alfa) therap y, he/she 
will be evaluated for the presenc e of neutralizing and total binding antibodies.
8.3.5 Unscheduled Visit
For an y unscheduled visit (except for collection of I P) a clinical assessment will be performed as 
per the scheduled follow -up visits except for HRQoL, ECG, and IR determination unless the 
unscheduled visit serves as a replacement for an y missed scheduled FU visit (missed FU visit 
would still be a protocol deviation but should be captured along with the reason for not having 
performed the scheduled FU visit) . Subjects who have >1 bleeding episode in 3 months, or an 
increased frequency  of bleeding, should go to the study  site for an unscheduled visit. Follow -Up 
visits after the subject has experienced a bleed may be requested b y the investigator. Additional 
assessments may  be requi red which are at the discretion of the investigator.
8.3.6 End of Study Visit/Termination Visit
Subjects will participate in this study  for at least 12 months. After this 12 -month period, the end 
of study  visit is scheduled once rVWF (vonicog alfa) is commercial ly available in their 
respective countries or until subjects have been treated in the stud y for a maximum of 3 y ears, 
whichever occurs earlier. Any  subject who discontinues the study  treatment should have a 
termination visit as soon as possible after the d ecision to discontinue trial treatment. If asubject’s

decision to discontinue the study  participation occurs prior to rVWF (vonicog alfa) is 
commerciall y available in their respective countr yor until the subject has been treated in the 
study  for a maximum of 3 y ears but after the subject has completed at least 12 months on study  
treatment, then the subject will be considered as “completed study  treatment”. A washout period 
of at least 72 hour s is required between the last infusion and the EOS/ termination visit. The 
EOS/termination visit will comprise a full assessment for safety  and immunogenicity .
Additionally , Subjects in Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4 will undergo a PK/PD assessment at the End of 
Study  Visit using their last scheduled prophy lactic dose. The EOS PK assessment I P infusion 
should occur 96 hours after the preceding infusion and will be given at the study  site after the 
blood sample for immunology  testing is drawn. Blood samples for PK/ PD anal ysis will be drawn 
within 30 minutes pre
-infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion (15 ±5 minutes, 
30±5minutes, 60 ±5 minutes, 3 ±0.5 hours, 6 ±0.5 hours, 12 ±0.5 hours, 24 ±0.5 hours, 
30±2hours, 48 ±2 hours, 72 ±2 hours and 96 ±2 hours). If a subject experiences a bleeding 
episode during this PK assessment, no subsequent blood sample will be drawn. The subject, once 
recovered, is eligible to repeat the PK assessment.
8.3.7 Follow -up Period
Not applicable.
8.3.8 Additional Care of Subjects after the Stud y
No aftercare is planned for this study .
8.3.9 Subject Diary
An electronic subject diary  will be provided to each subject at the screening visit to record the 
following information:
IP infusions to include date, start and stop times of the infusion, number of v ials utilized, 
and infusion volume for prophy lactic treatment or treatment of spontaneous and traumatic 
bleeding episodes
Details of bleeding episodes (site, ty pe, severity  and date/time of bleeding) and response to 
treatment as described in Section 8.4.2.4
Subjective (subject’s) 
hemostatic efficacy  assessments
Untoward events/unwanted experiences
Concomitant medications (including immunizations) and non -drug therapies
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)

SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
Subjects and/or their legally  authorized representatives will be trained on use of the diary . The 
diary  will be provided in electronic format and remain with the subject for the duration of the 
study . The investig ator will review the diary  for completeness and request missing information 
periodicall y and in a timely manner. The investigator will record/capture any unwanted 
experience reported b y the subject which may qualify as an AE on the AE eCRF.
Infusions perfo rmed at the study  site will first be recorded in the site’s source documents and not 
in the subject diary .
Subject entries in the diary will serve as source records. During study  participation the 
investigator has access to the database holding the subject diary  data. After study  closure, the 
investigator will receive the diary  records for their subjects, including audit trail records, in PDF 
format. The data will be transmitted to the CRF by a validated transfer.
E
-diary  use is not optional; it is required per protocol. Therefore, if the subject or caregiver 
experiences an y problem with the use of the e -diary , they  should inform the site/I nvestigator
immediately  and follow the instructions given to record an y information on the use of IP 
(including the regu lar planned proph ylactic infusions and infusions to treat any  acute bleed ), on 
the bleeds experienced, untoward events, concomitant medications, and health resource use, until 
these data can be recorded in a properl y working e -diary .
8.4Study Assessments 
8.4.1 Dem ographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
Subject demographic information and Other Baseline Characteristics including gender, age, and 
race, medical history , prior medications, latest bleeding episodes, OD treatment, investigator 
assessment of hemostati c efficacy , etc. will be collected prior to the subject receiving the first 
dose of IP.
8.4.2 Efficacy
8.4.2.1 Assessment of Spontaneous Bleeding Episodes/ABR
The ABR will be assessed based upon each individual spontaneous bleed, requiring coagulation 
factor replacement therapy, i.e., rVWF (vonicog alfa) treatment. The following details on 
bleeding episodes will be recorded b y the subject in the electronic diary (for home treatment), by
the subject’s healthcare provider in the site’s source documents (for treatments away  from the 
primary  investigative site), or b y authorized, qualified personnel at the participating site in the 
subject’s medical records (for hosp ital-based treatment):
Location of bleed; i.e., joint, menorrhagia, epistaxis, gastrointestinal, soft tissue, muscle, 
body  cavity , intracranial, etc.
For non-commercial use only
Takeda CONFIDENTIAL Page 96
rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
Type of bleed; i.e., spontaneous, traumatic, unknown
Severity  of bleed; i.e., minor, moderate, and major ( see Table 13)
Date and time of onset of bleed
Date and time of each infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) or rVWF (vonicog alfa) -
ADVATE 
(rFV III, octocog alfa) used to treat a bleeding episode
Date and time of resolution of the bleeding episode
Type and number of analgesics as well as additional hemostatic treatments required
Other concomitant medications
Non-drug therapies
AEs (refer to Appendix 3.1)
Study  site personnel are qualified after they  have undergone training during the qualification of 
the site. All ty pes of bleeds, including traumatic bleeds, will be recorded, however onl y 
spontaneous bleeds requiring VWF treatment will be considered for the assessment of ABRs 
used for primary  outcome assessment.
Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location (e.g., right knee) with the same etiology  
(i.e., spontaneous versus injury ) within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a 
single bleed by the investigator . Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same 
injury  (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) should be counted as a single bleeding 
episode by the investigator .
All efforts should be made to use rVWF for treatment of bleeding episodes. If needed ,the use of 
a VWF concentrate other than I P for the treatment of bleeding episodes will not disqualify  the 
subject from further participation in the study  and will not be considered a protocol deviation but 
should be reported to the medical monitors and the study  team . The use of non -IP product and 
the reason should be documented.
8.4.2.2 Evaluation of Spontaneous ABR Before rVWF Prophylaxis and ABR Under rVWF
Prophylactic Treatment
At screening, the subject’s medical history  will be recorded, including the number of all 
spontaneous bleeding episodes within the past 12 months OD treatment. The ABR during the 
12months before proph ylactic treatment will be the b aseline for evaluation of ABR under rVWF 
prophy lactic treatment (Cohort 4). The maximum interval of bleed -
free periods as well as trauma 
induced bleeding episodes will also be recorded.

8.4.2.3 Number of Infusions and Total Weight -adjusted Consumption of rVWF and 
ADVATE
The number of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ,if/when needed , ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (in 
case of bleeding episode treatment) infusions will be logged in the subject diary . Based on these 
entries the weight -adjusted consumption will be calculated.
8.4.2.4 Assessment of Efficacy for Treatment of Bleeding Episode
Investigators will be asked to assess and record hemostatic efficacy  after resolution of each 
bleeding episode, as soon as possible, preferabl y within 24 hours after the bleed resolution, using 
the 4
-scale rating s ystem outlined in Table 14.In order to perform the hemostatic efficacy  
assessment for an y acute bleeding episode, the investigator should be contacted b y the 
subject/subject’s care giver as soon as a bleeding episode is experienced b y the subject. Once 
contacted by the subject/ care-giver, the investigator should collect the information on the nature
eg, spontaneous or traumatic) , location (eg, oral/gum, nose/epistaxis, etc) , and severit y (eg, 
severe, moderate, mild/minor) of the b
leed to be able to provide the subject with the instruction 
on how to treat the bleed (eg, how man y infusions of I P may  be needed to stop the bleeding) .

estimate on the number of IP infusions needed to treat the bleeding episode will be 
used by  the investigator to compare it to the number of actual infusi ons that were given to the 
subject to stop the bleed to be able to assess the hemostatic efficacy  per 4 -point Efficacy  Rating 
Scale ( Table 14).

8.4.2.5 Assessment of Efficacy for Treatment for Surgical Bleeding
For those undergoing surgery , the operating surgeon will be asked to assess and record actual 
versus predicted blood los s and intraoperative hemostatic efficacy  immediately  after surgery .
The investigator will be asked to assess and record an overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy  
24 hours after the last perioperative rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusion or at day  14 post -operat ion, 
whichever occurs first, using the 4 -scale rating s ystem described in Table 15.

8.4.3 Safety
8.4.3.1 Adverse Events
At each stud y visit, subjects will be questioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs have 
occurred since the previous visit (e.g., “Have you had an y health problems since your last 
visit?”) . AEs are collected from the time informed consent is signed. See Appendix 3 for AE 
definitions, assessment, collection time frame, and reporting procedures.

8.4.3.2 Thromboembo lic Events 
Thromboembolic events are considered important identified risk of rVWF treatment, hence, 
indices of thromboembolic events such as clinical evidence of thrombosis will be monitored 
during the stud y. In the case of clinical signs of any thrombotic event other than superficial 
thrombosis, additional diagnostic procedures are required according to each institution’s standard 
of care which may  consist of, but are not limited to the following:
For DVT: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), compression ultrasound or impedance 
plethy smograph y.
For pulmonary  embolism: ECG, chest radiography, perfusion/scintiscan or MRI .
For m yocardial infarction: ECG, cardiac enzymes, echocardiograph y
For stroke: diffusion
-weighted magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography , 
ABCD scoring, carotid imaging
Results of diagnostic procedures may  be forwarded to the sponsor to be reviewed by  an 
independent external expert panel, such as the Data Monitoring Committee, if applicable.
8.4.3.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction
Anaph ylactic reaction is highl y likely when an y of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips, tongue -uvula) and 
at least one of the following:
a.Respiratory  compromise (e.g., dy spnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory  flow [PEF], and hy poxemia)
b.Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated s ymptoms of end -organ d ysfunction (e.g., 
hypotonia [collapse], sy ncope, and incontinence)
2.
Two or more of the following that occur rapidly  after exposure to a likel y allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours):
a.Involvement of the skin or mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing , 
swollen lips -tongue -uvula)
b.Respiratory  compromise (e.g., dy spnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)

d.Persistent gastrointestinal sy mptoms (e.g., crampy abd ominal pain, vomiting)
3.Reduced BP after exposure to a known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a.Infants and children: low sy stolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in 
systolic BP
b.Adults: sy stolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline BP
If a subject develops a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaph ylaxis) in the course of the clinical 
study  this needs to be reported as SAE ( Appendix 3 ). Additional blood draws for Anti- VWF 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody  testing will be drawn.
8.4.3.4 Urgent Safety Measures
An urgent safet y measure is an immediate action taken, which is not defined by the protocol, in 
order t o protect subjects participating in a clinical trial from immediate harm. Urgent safety  
measures may  be taken by  the sponsor or clinical investigator, and may  include any  of the 
following:
Immediate change in study  design or stud y procedures
Temporary  or permanent halt of the clinical trial 
Any other immediate action taken in order to protect clinical trial participants from 
immediate hazard to their health and safet y
The investigator may  take appropriate urgent safety  measures in order to protect subjects against 
any immediate hazard to their health or safet y. The measures should be taken immediately and 
may be taken without prior authorization from the sponsor. I n the event(s) of an apparent 
immediate hazard to the subject, the investigator will notify  the sponsor immediately  by phone 
and confirm notification to the sponsor in writing as soon as possible, but within 1 calendar day 
after the change is implemented. The sponsor will also ensure the responsible ethics committees 
(ECs) and relevant competent au thority (s) are notified of the urgent measures taken in such cases 
according to local regulations.
8.4.3.5 Untoward Medical Occurrences
Untoward medical occurrences occurring before the first exposure to I P are not considered AEs 
(according to the definition of AE , see Appendix 3 ). However, each serious untoward medical 
occurrence experienced before the first IP exposure (i.e., from the time of signed informed 
consent up to but not including the first IP exposure) will be described on the Serious Adverse

Event Report (SAER). These events will not be considered as SAEs and will not be included in 
the anal ysis of SAEs.
8.4.3.6 Non-Medical Complaints
A non- medical complaint (NMC) is any  alleged product deficiency  that relates to identity , 
quality , durabilit y, reliability , safet y and performance of the product but did not result in an 
AE. NMCs include but are not limited to the following:
A failure of a product to exhibit its expected pharmacological activit y and/or design 
function, e.g. reconstitution difficulty
Missing components
Damage to the product or unit carton
A mislabeled product (e.g., potential counterfeiting/tampering)
A bacteriological, chemical, or ph ysical change or deterioration of the product causing it to 
malfunction or to present a hazard or fail to meet label claims
Any NMCs of the product will be documented on an NMC form and reported to the sponsor 
within 1 business day . If reque sted, defective product(s) will be returned to the sponsor for 
inspection and anal ysis according to procedures
8.4.3.7 Medical, Medication, and Non -Drug Therapy History
At screening, the subject’s medical history  will be described for the following body  systems 
including severity  or surgery  and start and end dates, if known: ey es, ears, nose, and throat; 
respiratory ; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal; musculoskeletal; neurological; endocrine; 
hematopoietic/lymphatic; dermatological; and genitourinary . The subject’s medical history  will 
also include documented history  of OD or pdVWF prophy laxis treatment for at least the past 
12months and a documented history , e.g., patient charts and prescription information, of all 
bleeding episodes within the past 12 months (up t o 24 months if available).
All medications taken and non- drug therapies received in the 30 day s prior to study  entry  and all 
concomitant medications and non
-drug therapies during study  will be recorded on the CRFs. 
COVID -19 vaccination information will be recorded as prior or concomitant medication.
Data on medical history , drug and non -drug therapy  history  of subjects transitioning from study  
071301 or 071102 will be used from the eCRF of the prior studies, will be updated, if applicable,

8.4.3.8 Physical Examination
At screening and subsequent study  visits, a phy sical examination will be performed by  the 
investigator. A complete phy sical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
cardiovascul ar, respiratory , gastrointestinal, and neurological s ystems. 
A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the general appearance, 
head and neck, ey es and ears, nose and throat, chest, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities and 
joints, lymph nodes, skin, and neurological. 
Abnormalities identified at the screening visit and at subsequent study visits will be 
recorded inthe subject’s source documents. At study  visits, if a new abnormal or worsened 
abnormal pre -existing condition is de tected, the condition will be described on the AE CRF. 
Ifthe abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it was due to an error, due to a preexisting 
disease not clinicall y significant, a s ymptom of a new/worsened condition alread y recorded as an 
AE, or d ue to another issue that will be specified, the investigator will record the justification on 
the source record. 
8.4.3.9 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be assessed pre -and post -infusion at each visit, if not stated otherwise:
Height (cm) (Screening only ) and weight (kg) (pre- infusion only )
Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) baseline measurements will be measured after a 
10-minute rest in the supine/semi- recumbent position.
Pulse (beats/min) will be measured at the distal radial arteries under the same conditi ons as 
above.
Respiratory  rate (breaths/min) will be measured over a period of 1 minute under the same 
conditions as above.
Body temperature (ºC or ºF) may be determined by oral, rectal, axillary, or tympanic 
measurement at the discretion of the investigat or. However, the same method should be 
used for all measurements in 1 subject.
Vital signs will be measured at screening and within 30 minutes before and 30 ± 15 minutes after 
administration of I P, at each study  visit, and at study  completion/termination. Blood pressure will 
be measured when subjects are in the supine/semirecumbent position.
The investigator will assess whether a change from baseline (screening visit) in vital signs may  
be deemed clinically  significant and whether the change should be consi dered and recorded as an 
AE. If assessed as an AE, the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign, will be recorded 
For non-commercial use only

SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
on the AE eCRF. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or 
etiology  of an abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when 
clinically  indicated. Any  abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the 
investigator.
8.4.3.10 Electrocardiogram
A standard 12- lead ECG at rest will be performed at screening, at the 6- month and 12 -month 
follow -up visit and at the study  termination visit and evaluated for medical significance b y the 
investigator.
8.4.3.11 Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory  tests will be performed according to the laboratory ’s standard procedures.
Reference ranges will be supplied by  the laboratory  and used to assess the results for clinical 
significance and out -of-range changes which may be associated with, or constitute, an AE. 
Theinvestigator should assess out -of-range clinical laboratory  value s for clinical significance, 
indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinically  significant or clinicall y significant. Abnormal 
clinical laboratory  values, which are unexpected or not explained by  the subject’s clinical 
condition, may , at the discretion of t he investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible 
until confirmed, explained, or resolved. 
A complete list of the clinical laboratory  tests to be performed is provided in Appendix 2 .
8.4.3.11.1 Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values
For VWF and FVIII laboratory  assessments no evaluation of clinical significance is necessary .
Each other laboratory  value (except results to determine genetics of the underly ing VWD disease 
and blood group) has to be assessed b y the investigator and the assessment will be recorded on 
the eCRF. The investigator will determine for each abnormal labor atory  value whether the value 
is considered clinicall y significant or not and provide the reference range including the units. For 
clinically  significant values, the investigator will indicate if the value constitutes a new AE and 
record the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF, is a s ymptom or related to a 
previously  recorded AE, is due to a pre -existing disease, or is due to another issue that will be 
specified. If the abnormal value was not clinically significant, the investigator will indic ate the 
reason, i.e. because it is due to a preexisting disease, due to a lab error, due to variation or due to 
another issue that will be specified. 
Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology  of an 
abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically  indicated. 
Any abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator. In

general, all laboratory  tests will be performed at central laboratories, ex cept the pregnancy  and 
blood group tests which will be performed at the local laboratory . In some cases, i.e. under 
extraordinary  circumstances including an y condition that may  be considered of medical urgency  
per investigator’s assessment or limitations d ue to public health safet y measures, local laboratory 
can be used (e.g. to ensure the immediate availability  of the result) after discussion with medical 
monitor and explicit approval by  sponsor/CRO, and a back-up sample should be drawn for 
confirmatory  measurement at the central laboratory. In principle, results from the central 
laboratory  will be used for data analy sis purposes. Any  abnormal laboratory  value that is
considered clinically  significant by  the investigator based on a local laboratory  test result 
(reference range and the units to be provided) should be confirmed b y a central laboratory  test 
result for which the sample is drawn/collected within 24 hours of the abnormal finding b y the 
local laboratory .
Any seroconversion result for HIV, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), 
hepatitis C virus (HCV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) shall be re -tested.
8.4.3.12 Pregnancy Test
A urine and/or serum beta -hCG pregnancy  test will be performed on all females of child -bearing 
potential at the screening visit an d, if deemed necessary  by PI, can be ongoing basis at any  time 
during the stud y, if pregnancy is suspected; or on withdrawal of the subject from the study .
8.4.3.13 Immunology
8.4.3.13.1 Antibodies to VWF and FVIII
All subjects will be tested for binding and neutralizing anti bodies to VWF and FVIII at each 
ofthe scheduled visits. Testing will be done prior to I P infusion and with at least a 72 -hour 
wash -out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any  suspicion of inhibitor development 
(e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may  be tested at 
the discretion of the investigator. 
The assay s to detect neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been validated. 
Caution is advised in interpreting positive results. In particul ar, an y clinical association, changes 
in the natural history  of the disease, effect of therapy , etc. needs to be taken into account for final 
judgment. The sponsor’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice . As part of 
the AE follow -up, a ny sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central 
laboratory  testing. Onl y confirmed neutralizing anti-VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors. 
These subjects need to be closely  monitored and therapy  adjusted accordingly .

SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
8.4.3.13.1.1 Neutra lizing Antibodies to VWF
Three functional VWF assay s, VWF:CB, VWF:RCo, and FVIII binding (VWF:FVIIIB), will be 
used to test for the presence of inhibitory  anti- VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to 
VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be mea sured b y the Bethesda assay with 
Nijmegen modification (Kasper 1991) . The amount of inhibitor is expressed as Bethesda units 
(BU) per mL. One BU is thereby defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured 
activity  in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples.
If a subject has a measur able baseline level of VWF activity  in the respective assay , it is taken 
into account in the calculation of the residual activity . However, if baseline levels are too high 
(>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may  not be reliabl y detected.
To exclude false positive results, the detection limit for anti-VWF inhibitors was set to 1 BU/ml 
for all 3 assay s. The rationale for this cut -off value is the relativel y high confidence interval (CI) 
of the underl ying assay s, making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the 
Bethesda reference curve uncertain (Lillicr ap 2008 ).
A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti -VWF inhibitors, 
if detected.
8.4.3.13.1.2 Binding Antibodies to VWF
The presence of total b inding anti -VWF antibodies will be determined by  an enzy me-linked 
immunosorbent assay  (ELISA). For this assay  (ELISA), recombinant human VWF will be coated 
onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control
or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated 
antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti- human 
antibody  (secondary  antibody ).
Plasma samples are analy zed for binding antibodies against the specific antigen in 2 steps. First, 
the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, 
the specificit y of positive antibody  results is confirmed. I nbrief, all samples are serially  dilut ed 
(initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2).
Thetiter endpoint, defined as the highest dilution that still gives a positive signal above cut off 
level, is determined in 2 independent duplicates. The cut off level is established based on 
background signal level of healthy  plasma donors (n>100) and set to include 5% false positives 
to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay  is validated allowing an assay  
variability  of ±1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤2 titers steps may  be due to variability of 
theELISA assay . Specificity  has to be confirmed in a competition assay  when a sample has a

rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in 
the screening assay  at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive 
screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject 
sample (re -screen) and for the subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is 
> 2titer steps. Antib ody titers of subject samples will only  be reported as positive, if the 
results of the screening and confirmatory  anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be 
reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (indepen dent of the 
result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure).
A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively  if a sample tests 
positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer 
increases by  more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closel y monitored and therap y 
adjusted accordingly .
8.4.3.13.1.3 Neutralizing Antibodies (Inhibitors) to FVIII
Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII will be assessed b y the Nijmegen modification of 
the Bethesda assay  in a central laboratory . To verify  a FVIII inhibitor , additional testing (such as 
tests for Lupus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive FVIII inhibitor tests will be confirmed 
by a second test performed on an indepen dent sample obtained 2 to 4 weeks following the first
test. Only  confirmed positive FVIII inhibitor test result will be reported as an SAE.
8.4.3.13.1.4 Binding Antibodies to FVIII
Binding ant ibodies against FVIII will be anal yzed using a proprietary  enzyme immunoassay . 
Thetesting strategy  will be as described for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing 
samples will be identified in a screening assay  followed by  a confirmatory  assay  to exclude false 
positive results.
8.4.3.13.2 Antibodies to Other Proteins
Plasma will be assay ed for the presence of antibodies against CHO protein (total Ig), murine IgG 
and human Furin (total Ig) using proprietary  enzyme immunoassay s. Antibodies to the other 
proteins will be tested at Screening, every  6months during follow -up, and at the End of Study  
visit. Antibody  containing samples will be identified in a screening assay  followed by a 
confirmatory  assay  to exclude false positive results.
8.4.3.13.2.1 Anti -CHO Protein
Total Ig antibodies against CHO protein will be analy zed. For this assay  (ELISA), C HO protein 
derived from cultures of untransfected cells and propagated under the identical cell culture 
conditions used for ADVATE production will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated 
with dilutions of the positive control, negative control or test sample. Antibodies against CHO

protein that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti- human antibody  (secondary  antibody ).
8.4.3.13.2.2 Anti -Murine IgG
A commerciall y available ELISA (Medac, Hamburg, Germany ) will be used to detect and to 
quantify  IgG antibodies originating from human plasma that are directed against mouse -IgG 
(human anti - mouse antibodies [HAMA]). Microtiter plates coated with mouse IgG will be 
incubated with d ilutions of the standard, the positive control, the negative control or the test 
sample. Antibodies against mouse IgG that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen 
and form a bridge to a peroxidase coupled mouse IgG antibod y that will be used for detection 
(bridging format of the ELISA assay ).
8.4.3.13.2.3 Antibodies to Human Furin
Total Ig antibodies a gainst human Furin will be analy zed. For this assay  (ELISA), recombinant 
human Furin will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive 
control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human Furin that are present in 
the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP) -coupled goat anti- human antibody  (secondary  antib ody).
8.4.4 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
For subjects in Cohort 4, a PK/PD assessment using a dose of 50 IU (±5) IU/kg rVWF:RCo will 
be performed at the baseline visit, and a washout period of at least 5 day s is required before the 
infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) for PK assessment can be administered.
Subjects in Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4 will undergo a PK/PD assessment at the End of Study  Visit 
using a scheduled dose. The PK assessment IP infusion should occur 96 hours after the preceding 
infusion and will be given at the study  site after the blood sample for immunology  testing is 
drawn.
At both the initial and EOS PK/PD assessment, blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes 
pre-infusion, and at 11 time points postinfusion (15 [±5] minutes, 30 [±5] minut es, 
60[±5] minutes, 3 [±0.5] hours, 6 [±0.5] hours, 12 [±0.5] hours (may  be drawn at 10 [ ±1] hours 
for subject convenience) , 24 [±0.5] hours, 30 [±2] hours, 48 [±2] hours, 72 [±2] hours and 
96[±2] hours). VWF activity  will be determined using the VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and the 
VWF:Ag assay . FVIII activity  will be measured using the 1- stage clotting assay  to assess the PD 
of rVWF (vonicog alfa).
If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK/PD assessment, no subsequent blood 
sample will be drawn in that specific PK/PD period. The guidance provided in Section 6.2.2 has

to be followed for the treatment of the bleeding episode. The subject, once recovered, is eligible 
to repeat the PK/PD assessment.
IR will be determined at each follow -up visit (until the 12 -month visit) based on VWF:RCo 
activity  assessed prior to and after I P infusion. rVWF (vonicog alfa) will be infused at the regular 
prophy lactic dose. The blood sample for IR analy sis will be drawn within 30 minutes prior to I P 
infusion and 30 minutes ±5 minutes after IP infusion. 
8.4.5 Health -related Quality of Life (HRQoL), Treatment Satisfaction and Healthcare 
Resource Utilization
8.4.5.1 HRQoL
Health related Qualit y of Life assessment for the subjects ≥18 y ears of age, is based on 
3questionnaires: EuroQoL 5 -dimension questionnaire 3 level version (EQ -5D- 3L)
(Rabin and de Charro 2001) , Short Form (36) Health Survey  (SF-36) 
(Ware and Sherbourne 1992) , and Von Willebrand I mpact Questionnaire (V -WIQ) 
(Ito et al. 2011 ). Assessment for pediatric subjects between 2 and 18 y ears of age at screening, is 
based on 3 questionnaires: EQ -5D-Y (for subjects aged ≥7 years, parent- proxy  version for ages 4 
to<7 years) (Rabin and de Charro 2001 )and PedsQL TM(Varni et al. 1999) , Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS) Pain Score. Pediatric subjects aged <2 y ears will not complete HR QoL 
questionnaires.
A named member of study site staff will administer these questionnaires to all subjects at the 
following time points:
Screening visit/baseline (PK assessment) visit
Study  follow -up visit (after 6 months [±2] weeks)
Study  Completion Visit (after 12 months [±2] weeks)
The SF -36 is a validated, generic HRQoL instrument, measuring phy sical, emotional, social 
functioning as well as overall general health. I t captures the following 8 domains: Role Phy sical, 
Bodily  Pain, Phy sical Functionin g, General Health, Vitality , Social Functioning, Role Emotional

groups of 2 to 4 y ears (21 items) and 5 to 7 y ears (23 items) and a child version for the age group 
of 8 to 12 y ears (23 items).
The EuroQoL 5 -dimension questionnaire 3 level, EQ-5D- 3L, is a tool to assess health status in 
subjects ≥18years of age that has 5 socially  relevant domains: mobility , self -care, usual activity , 
pain- discomfort, and anxiety -depression. The subject uses a visual analog scale to provide a 
self-assessment of their health, ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state ) to 100 (best 
imaginable health state). For children 7 to 17 y ears, there is a child version, EQ -5D-Y, and a 
parent -proxy version is used for children 4 to <7 years of age.
A VAS Pain scale will be used for subjects to rate their level of pain.
8.4.5.2 Treatment Satisfaction 
Treatment Satisfaction will be assessed using The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for 
Medication -9 (TSQM -9) (Bharmal et al. 2009 ), which is a validated measure used to assess 
treatment satisfaction with medication in patients. It is comprised of 9 questions that provide 
scores on 3 scales: Effectiveness (3 items), Convenience (3 items), Global Satisfaction (3 items).
Three sub-scales domain scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing higher 
satisfaction with the treatment on that domain.
8.4.5.3 Healthcare Resource Utilization 
The subject’s use of health resources such as hospitalizations, emergency  room visits, and 
doctor’s office visits will be recorded. The impact of VWD on the subject’s health will also be 
assessed through recording the number of day s missed from school or work.

9.STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be anal yzed by the sponsor or its agent. 
The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the efficacy  and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for 
summarizing other study  information su ch as subject disposition, demographics and baseline 
characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The 
SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused and spurious data will be addressed.
Any protocol deviations surrounding COVID-19 or other public health emergencies will be 
clearl y identified, described, and documented in a sy stematic way  and in line with regulatory  
authorities’ recommendations. These protocol deviations will be summarized separatel y in the 
clinical study
 report. These data may  be handled differentl y in the final data anal ysis, with 
documentation in the SAP.
To preserve the integrit y of the statistical anal ysis and study  conclusions, the SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock, or earlier if required by applicable standard operating 
procedures.
All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS Ò(SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC 27513) 
version 9.4 or later. 
9.2Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monitoring Committee
An interi m anal ysis will be performed after all subjects in prophy lactic treatment cohorts have 
completed the 12 -month visit. Additional interim anal yses may  be performed as needed to 
support submissions to health authorities. The interim analy sis will be performed on a cleaned 
snapshot of the study  database. The interim anal ysis data will be used in preparing an interim 
clinical study  report and in support of regulatory  submissions.
A DMC will be involved in the management of this study . The purpose of the DMC is t o ensure 
the safet y of the subjects in the study  by reviewing the study  data on an ad hoc basis. Further 
details regarding the DMC can be found in the DMC charter, which will be available prior to the 
administration of investigational product. 
9.3Sample Size and Power Considerations

occurrence will be tabula ted.
Temporall y associated AEs are defined as AEs that begin during infusion or within 24 hours 
(or1 day  where time of onset is not available) after completion of infusion, irrespective of being 
related or not related to treatment. Temporall y associated A Es will be presented in summary  
tables. Causally related AEs will be presented similarly .
A listing of all AEs will be presented by subject identifier, age, sex, preferred term and reported 
term of the AE, duration, severit y, seriousness, action taken, out come, causality  assessment b y 
investigator, onset date, stop date and medication or non- drug therap y to treat the AE.

with the occurrence of neutralizing (inhibit ory) antibodies to VWF and FVIII, occurrence of 
binding antibodies to VWF and FVIII, and occurrence of binding antibodies to CHO proteins, 
mouse IgG and rFurin.
Vital signs and laboratory parameters will be summarized descriptivel y. Shift tables will be 
prepared for laboratory  parameters. Clinically  significant abnormal values in routine laboratory  
parameters and vital signs will be summarized.
9.7Other Analyses
9.7.1 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
A listing of PK blood sample collection times as well as derived sampling time deviations for 
VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, and FVIII activity  will be provided. 
PK and PD parameters will be derived using noncompartmental methods with Phoenix ®
WinNonlin ® Version 6.4 or higher (Certara, L.P. Princeton, New Jersey , US) and/or SAS ®
Version 9.4 or higher (SAS I nstitute, Inc., Cary , North Carolina, US).
All PK and PD analy ses will be based on the PKAS and will use actual elapsed time from the 
start of infusion, rather than scheduled sampling times, wherever possible. A de viation from the 
protocol specified blood sample drawing time window will not be a reason to exclude an 
observation from the analy sis. Samples with unknown actual and planned collection date/time or 
where the concentration could not be determined, or where results were biologicall y implausible 
will be excluded from the anal ysis.
If any concentration data are considered spurious (e.g. lack of biological plausibility ), the reason 
for exclusion from the analy sis and the anal ysis from which the data point was e xcluded will be

Prior to implementing changes in the study, the sponsor and the IRB/EC must approve an y 
revisions of all informed consent documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a 
subject safet y issue.
For sites outside the EU, the investigator is responsible for keeping the IRB/EC apprised of the 
progress of the study  and of any changes made to the protocol at least annually  or more 
frequentl y in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the 
IRB/EC. This can be the responsibility  of the sponsor or investigator for sites within the E U; or 
for multicenter studies, the coordinating principal investigator, according to national provisions. 
The investigator must also keep the local I RB/EC informed of any  serious and significant AEs as 
required b y IRB/EC procedures.
Privacy and Confidentia lity
All US-based sites and laboratories or entities providing support for this study , must, where 
applicable, compl y with the HIPAA of 1996. A site that is not a covered entity as defined b y 
HIPAA must provide documentation of this fact to the CRO.
The co nfidentialit y of records that may be able to identify subjects will be protected in

After subjects have consented to take part in the study , the sponsor and/or its representatives 
reviews their medical records and data collected during the study . These records and data may , in 
addition, be reviewed b y others including the following: independent auditors who validate the 
data on behalf of the sponsor; third parties with whom the sponsor may  develo p, register, or 
market rVWF; national or local regulatory  authorities; and the I RBs/ECs which gave approval 
for the stud y to proceed. The sponsor and/or its representatives accessing the records and data 
will take all reasonable precautions in accordance w ith applicable laws, regulations, and 
guidelines to maintain the confidentialit y of subjects’ identities. Subjects are assigned a unique 
identify ing number; however, their initials and date of birth may  also be collected, if permitted 
under local laws gove rning privacy . 
The results of studies containing subjects’ unique identify ing number, relevant medical records, 
and possibly  initials and dates of birth, where allowed per local law, may  be transferred to, and 
used in, other countries which may  not afford the same level of protection that applies within the 
countries where this study is conducted. The purpose of an y such transfer would include: to 
support regulatory  submissions, to conduct new data anal yses to publish or present the study  
results, or to answer questions asked by  regulatory or health authorities.
Study Results/Publication Policy
The term “Publication” shall mean an y paper, article, manuscript, report, poster, internet posting, 
presentation slides, abstract, outline, video, instructional mate rial, presentation (in the form of a 
written summary ), or other public disclosure of the study  results, in printed, electronic, oral, or 
other form. The parties understand and agree that participation in the study  may  involve a 
commitment to publish the da ta from all sites participating in the study  in a cooperative 
publication with other investigators prior to publication or oral presentations of the study  results 
on an individual basis. The site agrees not to publish or present the site’s study  results until such 
time as either the aggregate multi- site study  results are published in a cooperative publication or 
for a period of 1 year after termination or completion of the study  at all participating sites, 
whichever shall first occur. After that time, the s ite may  publish the site’s study  results in 
scientific journals or present the study  results at symposia or other professional meetings in 
accordance with the following provisions:
If the stud y is part of a multicenter study, the first publication of the s tudy results shall be made 
by the sponsor in conjunction with the sponsor’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication 
of the compiled and analy zed study  results. If such a multicenter publication is not submitted to a 
journal for publication by  the sponsor within an 18 -month period after conclusion, abandonment, 
or termination of the study at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be no multicenter 
study  publication of the study  results, an investigator may individuall y publish the stud y results

from the specific site in accordance with this section. The investigator must, however, 
acknowledge in the publication the limitations of the single site data being presented.
At least sixty  (60) day s prior to submitting an abstract, manuscript, or other document for 
publication, a cop y of the proposed publication will be provided to the sponsor by the site for 
review. Upon the sponsor’s request, the site agrees to remove an y and all confidential 
information (expressly  excluding study  results) ide ntified in the publication and to delay  such 
submission or presentation for an additional sixty  (60) day  period in order to allow the sponsor 
time to file any  patent application(s). All publications of the study  results shall appropriatel y 
reference the mu lti-site study  publication, if an y, or the fact that the study results are a subset of 
data resulting from a larger multi- site study .
The sponsor is committed to transparent dissemination of all scientific, technical and medical 
manuscripts generated from sponsor -supported research. Therefore, after January  1, 2018, the 
sponsor will require the submission of all sponsor-supported research manuscripts to journals 
that offer public availability  via Open Access (including publisher platforms/repositories and 
self-archiving). Open Access refers to the free at point of entry , online availability  of published 
research output with, where available, rights of re- use according to an End User License.
Unless otherwise required by  the journal in which the publication appears, or the forum in which 
it is made, authorship will comply  with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(ICMJE) Rec ommendation for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarl y

APPENDIX 3. ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR 
RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP, AND RE PORTING
Appendix 3.1 - Adverse Event Definitions
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship 
with this investigational product or medicinal product. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including a clinically  significant laboratory  finding), sy mptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
causality  is suspected (I CHGuidance ERA 1995).
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an y event emerging or manifesting at 
or after the initiation of treatment with an investigational product or medicinal product or an y 
existing eve nt that worsens in either intensity  or frequency  following exposure to the 
investigational product or medicinal product.
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward clinical manifestation of signs, sy mptoms or 
outcomes (whether cons idered related to investigational product or not and at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening. Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to 
an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer 
to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizations 
that are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled investig ations procedures or surgery  
for pre -existing conditions and have not worsened after initiation of treatment should not 
be classified as SAEs. 
For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be 
classified as an SAE; ho wever, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an 
elective or previously  scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as 
SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Results in a congenital abnormality /birth defect
For non-commercial use only
Takeda CONFIDENTIAL Page 128
rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may  be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subjec t and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such medical events include:
Bronchospasm associated with anaph ylaxis requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home; bloo d dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV), 
hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or 
parvovirus B19 (B19V)
For this protocol, the following events will not be collected as SAE(s):
Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore, are not AEs; they  will 
be evaluated in the context of effi cacy. If a bleeding episode was caused by  an injury , the 
injury  would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a 
bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of skin). Therefore, any  VWD -related bleeding event (e.g., 
epistaxis, gast rointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) will not be 
reported as AEs. However, the investigator may  decide that the event is an AE if the event 
also would have occurred in a health y individual under the same circumstances.
Seroconvers ion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study  
period.
Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity, specificit y, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safet y Information 
(RSI ). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product, but are not 
specificall y mentioned as occu rring with the particular product under investigation. 
The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using the IB as the RSI . This 
determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously  observed, but 
not on the basis of what might be anticipated form the pharmacological properties of a product.

SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is defined as any  suspected 
adverse reaction to study  treatment (i.e., inclu ding active comparators) that is both serious and 
unexpected. 
The event(s) must meet all of the following:
Suspected adverse reaction
Serious
Unexpected
Assessed as related to study  treatment
Symptoms of the Disease under Study
Symptoms of the disease und er study  should not be classed as AEs as long as they  are within the 
normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected disease progression and are part of the efficacy  or 
effectiveness data collected in the study . Significant worsening of s ymptoms should be record ed 
as an AE.
Preexisting conditions prior to randomization or initiation of study  medication are described in 
the medical history , and those that manifest with the same severity , frequency , or duration after 
drug exposure, are not be recorded as AEs. Howev er, when there is an increase in the severity , 
duration or frequency  of a preexisting condition, the event must be described on the AE CRF.
Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory  parameter, vital sign measure, or ECG assessment 
can represent an AE if the change is clinically  relevant or if, during administration of 
investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a value in the normative range to 
a value that is outside the normal range and considered clinically  significant, or a further waning 
of an alread y clinicall y significant value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation 
from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuin g 
administration or after the end of administration with the investigational product, and the range 
of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, should also be considered.
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal cl inical laboratory  (such as hematology  
panel or clinical chemistry panel), vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the 
pretreatment evaluation observed closest to the start of study  treatment, further investigations 
should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible

rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
explanation (e.g., concomitant disease or expected disease evolution) is found for the abnormal 
values.
The investigator should assess, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of the 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory  value, vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y 
significant and represents an AE.
Collection of ECG parameters is suggested to be performed in triplicates and conducted b y a 
central laboratory  for all study  subjects. 
Appendix 3.2 - Collection of Adverse Events 
All AEs/SAEs are collected from the time the informed consent document is signed until the 
defined follow -up period stated in Section 8.3.7. This includes events occurring during the 
screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not investigational product is 
administered. 
All AEs/SAEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline 
status or all variables have returned to baseline), regardless of whether the subject is still 
participating in the stud y. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved 
(the investiga tor does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event), or the 
event is otherwise explained.
Appendix 3.3 - Assessment of Adverse Events
Severity  Categorization
The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including t he start and stop 
dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity is captured as a new event. 
Worsening medical conditions, signs or sy mptoms present prior to initiation of investigational 
product, must be recorded as new AEs.
For exam ple, if a subject reports mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to initiation of dosing with the 
investigational product, and the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose a 
new AE of severe d yspepsia (with the appropriate date of onset) should be documented in the 
source.
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions:
Mild: A ty pe of AE that is usually  transient and may  require only  minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not general ly interfere with usual activities of 
daily  living.
For non-commercial use only
Takeda CONFIDENTIAL Page 131
rVWF
SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
Moderate: A t ype of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. 
The event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permane nt risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe: A t ype of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may  require intensive therapeutic intervention.
Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused b y the investigational product. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-
effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality  assessment must be 
documented in the source.
The following additional guidance may  be helpful:
Table A1 Adverse Event Relationship Categorization
Related The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling enough and/or follows a known or suspected 
response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s 
medical conditio n, other therapies, or accident.
Not related The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or 
biologic relationship exists between the inv estigational product and the event.
Outcome Categorization
The outcome of AEs must be documented in the source during the course of the study . Outcomes 
are as follows:
Fatal
Not Recovered/Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae
Recovering/Resolving
Unknown

If applicable, action taken (i.e., dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, 
drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF.
COVID -19 Vaccination -related AE
If applicable, AE will be assessed by  the Investigator whether it is related to COVID -19 
vaccination and the assessment will be recorded on the AE CRF.
Appendix 3.4 - Safety Reporting
Reference Safety Information
The RSI  for this study  is included in the IB which the sponsor has provided under separate cover 
to all investigators.
Reporting Procedures
All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by  the investigator to the Takeda Global 
Patient Safety  Evaluation (GPSE) Department and the CRO/Takeda me dical monitor within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the event. Note: The 24- hour reporting requirement for SAEs 
does not apply  to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Appendix 3.9) 
unless they  result in an SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Takeda “Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form 
for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol”, verify  the 
accuracy of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents 
(Note: Source documents are not to be sent unless requested), and fax or e -mail the form to the 
Takeda GPSE. A cop y of the Takeda “Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for Se rious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required by  Protocol” (and an y applicable follow -up 
reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Takeda medical monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact information section of the protocol.
Appendix 3.5 - Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to investigational product) are collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 8.3.7 and 
must be reported to Takeda GPSE Department and the CRO/Takeda medical monitor within 
24hours of the first awareness of the event.
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  the 
investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to Takeda GPSE
Department within 24 hours of the reported first becoming aware of the event.

SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
Append ix 3.6 - Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates
The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution 
date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the 
event is considered chronic. I n the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge 
dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y.
In addition, any  signs or sy mptoms reported b y the subject after signing the informed conse nt 
form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE,
must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate.
Appendix 3.7 - Fatal Outcome
Any SAE that results in the subject’s death (e.g., the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution 
date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s 
death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, wit hout a resolution date recorded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously  taken (e.g., drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of withdrawn should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death.
Appendix 3.8 - Pregnancy
All pregnancies are reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined 
follow -up period stated in Section 8.3.7.
Any report of pregnancy  for any  female study  participant or the partner of a male participant 
must be reported within 24 hours to the Takeda GPSE Department using the Takeda 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. 
A copy of the Takeda Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form (and an y 
applicable follow -
up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Takeda medical monitor using the 
details specified in the emergency  contact information section of the protoc ol. The pregnant 
female stud y participant must be withdrawn from the study.
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately  30 calendar day s postpartum.

SHP677 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 20 Dec 2021
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, elective abortion or 
congenital abnormalit y are considered SAEs and must be reported using the “Takeda Clinical 
Study  Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as 
Required b y Protocol”.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as a n SAE using the “Takeda Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required b y Protocol” as well as the “Takeda 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form”. The test date of the first
positiv e serum/urine b -hCG test or ultrasound result will determine the pregnancy  onset date.
Appendix 3.9 - Abuse, Misuse, Overdose and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they  result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Appendix 3.1. 
Note: The 24- hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports of abuse, misuse, 
overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE.
The categories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category .
Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product w hen used for a 
non-medical purpose (e.g., to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner 
that may  be detrimental to the individual and/or society .
Misuse 
–Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at 
any dose. (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as 
directed at the dose prescribed by  the protocol.)
Overdose –Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of investigational product higher 
than the protocol -prescribed maximum dose (VWF:RCo 80 I U/kg).
Medication Error – An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of 
an investiga tional product. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only  
as defined below.
Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation.
The administration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reportable as a 
medication error.

The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a 
reportable medication error.
All investigational product provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by  the 
parent/lega lly authorized representative/caregiver.
Appendix 3.10 - Urgent Safety Measures 
An urgent safet y measure is an immediate action taken, which is not defined by the protocol, in 
order to protect subjects participating in a clinical trial from immediate harm, these do not 
constitute de facto deviation from the protocol. Urgent safet y measures may be taken b y the 
sponsor or clinical investigator, and may  include any  of the following:
Immediate change in study  design or stud y procedures
Temporary  or permanent h alt of a given clinical trial or trials
Any other immediate action taken in order to protect clinical trial participants from 
immediate hazard to their health and safet y
The investigator may  implement urgent safety  measures to protect study  subjects from 
immediate hazard to their health or safet y. The measures should implement immediately  and 
does not require prior authorization from the sponsor. In the event(s) of an apparent direct hazard 
to the subject, the investigator will notify  the sponsor immediatel y by phone and confirm 
notification to the sponsor in writing as soon as possible, and within 1 calendar day after the 
change is implemented. The sponsor will also ensure the responsible EC(s) and relevant 
competent authorit y(s) are notified of the urgent safet y measures taken in such cases according to 
local regulations.
Appendix 3.11 
-Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee and 
Site Reporting
The sponsor is responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory  authorities: US central IRBs/EU 
central ECs of related, unexpected SAEs.
In addition the sponsor is responsible for notify ing active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs 
occurring during all interventional studies across the rVWF program.
The investigator is responsible for noti fying the local IRB/EC of SAEs or significant safet y 
findings that occur at his or her site as required b y IRB/EC procedures (see Appendix 1.5).

Appendix 3.12 – Postmarketing Experience
The most common postmarketing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in association with 
rVWF/VONVENDI treatment include infusion- related reactions (IRR) and anaph ylactic 
reactions. IRR may  clinically  manifest by  the followi ng symptoms: tachy cardia, flushing, rash, 
dyspnea, and blurred vision. I n the 2 spontaneous postmarketing cases reported as of 
30June 2021, the sy mptoms resolved and the patients fully  recovered in 20 minutes to 4 hours 
upon stopping the infusion. Two post- marketing cases of anaph ylactic reactions have been 
reported with use of VONVENDI in the post marketing setting. This ADR has never been 
observed in clinical trials.

APPENDIX 4. CONTRACE PTIVE GUIDANCE 
Female participants:
Female participants of childbea ring potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to use a 
highl y effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described below.
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependenta
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Com bined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb
Oral 
Intravaginal 
Transdermal 
Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
Oral 
Injectable 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independenta
Implantable progestogen only hormonal contraception associated w ith inhibition of ovulationb
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the w omen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.
Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk assoc iated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
participant.
NOTES: 
a) Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical 
studies. 
b) Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case, 2 highly effective methods of contraception should be 
utilized during the treatment period and fo r at least [X, corresponding to time needed to eliminate study 
treatment plus 30 days for study treatments with genotoxic potential]  after the last dose of study treatment

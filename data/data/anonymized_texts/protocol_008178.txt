1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
The purpose of this amendment is to:
●Align the treatment duration for subjects with GT1a infection and 
compensated cirrhosis (F4 fibrosis stage) with the recommended treatment 
duration that is found in the US prescribing information for the recently-approved AbbVie product containing the regimen included in this 
study (i.e., ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333).  The treatment duration for 
these patients is extended from 12 to 24 weeks in this amendment, with 12 weeks considered for some patients based on prior treatment history.
●Specify that at least 50, but no more than 110 subjects with fibrosis stage of F3 will be allowed to enroll.  Previously, enrollment of these subjects was capped at 100.
●Remove references to a patient portal, which will not be implemented for the study due to administrative reasons.
●Add the contact information for a new Emergency Medical Service that can be 
contacted by the investigator during a medical emergency if the Primary Study 
Designated Physician for the study is unavailable.
●Remove the evaluation of adherence to study drug regimens with the Subject 
Care Plan Model from the secondary objectives.  Adherence to the prescribed 
regimen (measured by pill counts for each type of tablet) will be conducted as a secondary efficacy endpoint.
An itemized list of all changes made to the protocol under this amendment can be found

Protocol Title:   
An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate Long-term Outcomes with ABT-450/Ritonavir/ABT-267 
(ABT-450/r/ABT-267) and ABT-333 With or Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Adults With Genotype 1 
Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (TOPAZ II)
Primary Objective:   
!To evaluate the effect of response to treatment (assessed by SVR 12status) on the long-term 
progression of liver disease in adults with chronic HCV GT1 infection who received treatment 
with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without ribavirin, as measured by all-cause death, liver-related death, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, and hepatocellular 
carcinoma.
Secondary Objectives:
!To evaluate the percentage of subjects achieving a 12-week sustained virologic response, SVR
12
(HCV RNA < lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] 12 weeks following treatment) in adults 
with chronic HCV genotype 1 (GT1) infection who receive treatment with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 
and ABT-333 with or without ribavirin.
!To assess the change from baseline in quality of life and fatigue following treatment (assessed 
by Short Form 36 Version 2 health survey [SF-36v2] and the Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy – Fatigue [FACIT–F]) questionnaires) by baseline fibrosis stage.
!Adherence to the prescribed regimen (measured by pill counts for each type of tablet).
Investigators:   
Multi-center trial:  Investigator information is on file at AbbVie.
Study Sites:

Methodology:   
The TOPAZ studies are composed of 2 studies (TOPAZ-I [Study M14-423; to be conducted in non-US 
regions] and TOPAZ-II [Study M14-222; to be conducted in the US]) due to administrative reasons.  This study (TOPAZ-II) is a Phase 3b, open-label, multi-center study designed together with companion study TOPAZ-I, which shares the primary objective of evaluating the effect of SVR
12status on the long-term 
clinical outcomes in adults with GT1 chronic HCV infection with or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either treatment-naïve or IFN/RBV (IFN or pegIFN with RBV) treatment-experienced.  In both studies, subjects will be treated with ABT-450/r/ ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without ribavirin 
(RBV).
Approximately 600 subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at approximately 50 US sites.  
At least 100, but no more than 150 subjects with fibrosis stage of F4 will be allowed to enroll.  At least 50, but no more than 110 subjects with fibrosis stage of F3 will be allowed to enroll.  The Metavir score system will be used to interpret the liver biopsy and determine the fibrosis stage.  In the absence of a liver biopsy, the equivalent Metavir score corresponding to the results of a screening FibroScan or FibroTest 
will be used to determine the fibrosis stage.
This study will utilize a Subject Care Plan Model.  The subject care plan model is a mechanism that 
allows subjects to receive reminders for upcoming study visits, reminders to take study drugs, information about  their HCV RNA values (if applicable) and/or receive disease specific education and 
encouragement at varying frequencies of contact.  
Subjects will be contacted by a designated nurse educator, contracted by the sponsor, throughout the trial.  
The nurse educator may interact with subjects by phone, email, in-person visit, postal mail, text message or combinations of these listed communications to facilitate the assigned subject care plan level.  After enrollment, the subjects will undergo a subject care plan model assessment that will be conducted by a 
designated nurse educator.  The care plan has three levels as detailed below:
Care Plan Level 1:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a low level of support will be assigned to 
Care Plan Level 1 and will be contacted approximately 2 to 3 times per week.
Care Plan Level 2:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a moderate level of support will be 
assigned to Care Plan Level 2 and will be contacted approximately 2 to 3 times per week and receive 
once daily study medication reminder.
Care Plan Level 3:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a high level of support will be assigned to 
Care Plan Level 3 and will be contacted approximately 3 to 5 times per week and receive twice daily 
study medication reminders.
The designated nurse educator will assign a care plan level after their initial assessment and may adjust 
the care plan level as needed throughout the trial.  The subject care plan model support will continue until 
subjects have completed their Post-Treatment Week 12 Visit.
The study will consist of a Screening Period, Treatment Period and a Post-Treatment Period. 
Treatment Period:  HCV GT1-infected subjects who are either treatment-naïve or previously treated with 
IFN/RBV (IFN or pegIFN with RBV) will receive ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT 333.  Subjects with 
HCV GT1a infection and all GT1-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis will also receive RBV.  The treatment duration will be 12 weeks for all subjects except HCV GT1a infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis, who will receive treatment for 24 weeks unless a treatment duration of 12 weeks 
is selected by the investigator based on the subject's prior treatment history.

Methodology (Continued):   
HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis who were assigned to 12 weeks of treatment 
under a previous version of this protocol will be assigned to 12 additional weeks of treatment unless 1) the investigator determines that a 12-week duration of therapy is appropriate based on the subject's prior treatment history; or 2) the subject has already completed the original study drug treatment and additional treatment cannot be initiated within 15 days of the date that the original 12-week treatment was 
completed.
Post-Treatment Period:  Subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be followed for up to 
260 weeks.  All subjects dosed with study drug who complete or prematurely discontinue study drug will 
be followed in the Post-Treatment Period for 5 years (PT Week 260) and will continue onto their 
post-treatment care plan (as part of the Subject Care Plan Model) through Post-Treatment Week 12.
The Post-Treatment Period will assess safety, antiviral response, and clinical outcomes, including 
all-cause death, liver-related death, liver decompensation, occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and 
liver transplantation.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
1)  The percentage of subjects achieving SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after the last actual dose 
of study drugs).  The SVR 12rate and corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson 
score method for the binomial proportion will be presented.
2)  The mean change from baseline in quality of lif e and fatigue to Post-Treatment Week 12 and to 
Post-Treatment Week 24 (assessed by Short-Form 36 Version 2 health survey (SF-36v2) and the 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT–F) questionnaires) will be assessed by subjects' fibrosis stage at baseline using an ANCOVA model with baseline fibrosis stage as the factor 
and baseline PRO score and SVR
12status as covariates.
3)  Adherence to the prescribed regimen (measured by pill counts for each type of tablet).
Safety:
The overall number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent adverse events will be 
tabulated by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term.  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be provided by severity rating and relationship to study drug.  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital sign measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized.  Laboratory test and vital sign values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be identified and the number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically significant values will be 
calculated.
Resistance: 
The following resistance information will be provided for a subset of the subjects who experience 
virologic failure:  1) the amino acid variants at baseline at signature resistance-associated positions identified by population nucleotide sequencing and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, 2) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature resistance-associated positions identified by population nucleotide sequencing and comparison to the baseline sequence, and 3) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature resistance-associated positions identified by population nucleotide sequencing and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference 
sequence.  
In addition, the persistence of viral resistance-associated amino acid variants will be evaluated in selected 
samples during the 5-year (through PT Week 260) Post-Treatment Period.

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with 170 million individuals 
chronically infected worldwide and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or both.
1  Cirrhosis develops after prolonged HCV infection.2  Complications 
of cirrhosis include hepatic decompensation (ascites, encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome, or hepatic synthetic dysfunction) and hepatocellular carcinoma, which ensues at a rate of about 3% per year.
3-6  Without liver transplantation, 
decompensated cirrhosis leads to death in 50% to 72% of patients after 5 years.7  As a 
result of the high prevalence of HCV infection and resultant complications, HCV is the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States and the world as a whole.
8  
Because a majority of patients are believed to have acquired their infection as young adults in the 1970s,
9,10the number of patients chronically infected for more than 20 years 
continues to rise,11,12and the prevalence of cirrhosis and related complications is expected 
to increase .13  In a cohort study of patients with HCV from the United States Department 
of Veterans Affairs (VA), the prevalence of cirrhosis has increased significantly over the past 10 years.
14  Based on a multicohort natural history model, the proportion of patients 
with cirrhosis in the United States is projected to reach 25% in 2010 and 45% in 2030.15
Treatment of HCV-infected patients could reduce the risk of cirrhosis, decompensation, cancer and liver-related deaths.  Among patients from the VA treated with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin therapy, achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) was associated with significant reduction in all-cause death compared to subjects who did not achieve SVR (5-year mortality rate in HCV genotype 1-infected patients:  6.7% versus 14.4%, respectively) .
16  In addition, the 5-year occurrence of the composite clinical events 
of death, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma were significantly lower in HCV-
infected patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who achieved SVR versus those without SVR (9.2% versus 28.2%, respectively) .
17  Patients with SVR following treatment 
with pegIFN with or without ribavirin (RBV) have also shown improvement in liver 
histology and a reduction in liver-related mortality in several studies .18-20  Moreover, 
, patients with compensated cirrhosis who achieve SVR essentially eliminate their 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
18
subsequent risk of decompensation, may achieve histologic regression, and decrease their 
risk of hepatocellular carcinoma by two-thirds .21-23  In patients with advanced fibrosis and 
d cirrhosis, viral suppression by more than 4 logs 10with pegIFN and RBV was associated 
with marked reduction in death/liver transplantation, and in liver-related morbidity and mortality .
24
Combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) targeting different steps of viral replication have the potential to significantly improve HCV treatment compared to the current interferon-containing regimens for HCV genotype 1 infection by increasing SVR rates, eliminating IFN as a component of therapy, increasing the safety and tolerability of treatment, shortening duration of therapy and simplifying the treatment algorithm.  In addition, wider application of DAA therapy and better responses with combination DAA regimens could significantly reduce the public health burden of this disease.
AbbVie's IFN-free regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection 
includes 3 DAAs targeting different steps in HCV replication.  ABT-450 is a nonstructural protein 3/nonstructural protein 4A (NS3/NS4A) protease inhibitor co-administered with the pharmacokinetic enhancer, ritonavir (ABT-450/r); ABT-267 (ombitasvir) is a NS5A inhibitor, and ABT-333 (dasabuvir) is a NS5B non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor.  The 3-DAA regimen has been studied with and without ribavirin in over 2,300 patients in Phase 3 trials across a variety of patient populations including those with compensated cirrhosis.  Based on Phase 3 data, the regimen with or without RBV appears to be safe, well tolerated and efficacious in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1-infected subjects including those with compensated cirrhosis.  The overall efficacy results (intent to-treat) from the Phase 3 studies are listed in Table 1 .

Phase 3 Placebo-Controlled Studies:  Studies M11-646 and M13-098  
Study M11-646 and Study M13-098 are randomized, placebo-controlled studies that 
assessed the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of therapy with 3 DAA + RBV in HCV genotype 1-infected treatment-naïve subjects (Study M11-646) and prior pegIFN/RBV non-responders (Study M13-098) without cirrhosis.  Subjects received 3-DAA + RBV for 12 weeks of treatment.  Subjects randomized to the placebo arm received placebo for 12 weeks, after which they received open-label 3-DAA + RBV for 12 weeks. 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
20
In Study M11-646, a total of 631 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose 
of study drug, of which 67.7% had HCV genotype 1a and 32.3% had HCV genotype 1b.  The SVR
12rate for treatment-naïve subjects receiving 3-DAA + RBV for 12 weeks was 
96.2%.  Virologic failure was noted in 7/322 (2.2%) genotype 1a subjects (on treatment virologic failure:  n = 1; relapse:  n = 6) and 1/151 (0.7%) genotype 1b subjects (relapse). 
In Study M13-098, a total of 394  subjects were randomized and received at least one dose 
of study drug, of which  58.4% had HCV genotype 1a, 41.4% had HCV genotype 1b, 49.0% were prior pegIFN/RBV null responders, 21.9/% were prior pegIFN/RBV partial responders, and 29.2% were prior pegIFN/RBV relapsers.  The SVR
12rate for 
treatment-experienced subjects receiving 3-DAA + RBV for 12 weeks was 96.3%.  Virologic failure (all relapse) was noted in 5/173 (2.9%) genotype 1a subjects and 2/123 (1.6%) genotype 1b subjects. 
Phase 3 Regimen-Controlled Studies:  Studies M13-389, M13-961 and M14-002
Studies M13-389, M13-961, and M14-002 are randomized, regimen-controlled trials that 
assessed the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with 3 DAAs with or without RBV.  Study M13-961 and Study M14-002 are placebo-controlled studies, while Study M13-389 is an open-label study.  The patient population was different in each of the 3 studies.  Study M13-389 enrolled genotype 1b-infected subjects with prior non-response to pegIFN/RBV, M13-961 enrolled genotype 1b-infected subjects who were treatment-naïve, and Study M14-002 enrolled genotype 1a-infected subjects who were treatment-naïve.  All three studies excluded subjects with cirrhosis.
In Study M13-389, a total of 186  subjects were randomized and received at least one dose 
of study drug, of which 34.9% were prior pegIFN/RBV null responders, 28.5% were prior pegIFN/RBV partial responders, and 36.6% were prior pegIFN/RBV relapsers.  The SVR
12rates were 96.6% in the 3-DAA + RBV arm and 100% in the 3-DAA without RBV 
arm.  The difference in SVR 12rates between the 2 regimens met the protocol-specified 
criteria for noninferiority; hence, the 3-DAA regimen without RBV demonstrated 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
21
noninferiority compared to 3-DAA + RBV.  No subject in either arm experienced 
on-treatment virologic failure or post-treatment relapse. 
In Study M13-961, a total of 419 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose 
of study drug.  The SVR 12rates for treatment-naïve subjects with HCV genotype 1b 
infection who received either 3 DAAs with or without RBV for 12 weeks were 99.5% and 99.0%, respectively.  The difference in SVR
12rates between the 2 regimens in this study 
also met the protocol-specified criteria for noninferiority.  One of the 419 treated subjects (3-DAA + RBV arm) experienced on-treatment virologic failure.  
In Study M14-002, 305 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of study 
drug.  The SVR
12rates for treatment-naïve subjects with HCV genotype 1a infection who 
received either 3 DAAs with or without RBV for 12 weeks in Study M14-002 were 97.0% and 90.2%, respectively.  The SVR
12rate in the 3-DAA arm did not achieve noninferiority 
to the 3-DAA + RBV arm.  Virologic failure was noted in 2/100 (2.0%) subjects (ontreatment virologic failure:  n = 1; relapse:  n = 1) in the RBV-containing regimen and 16/205 (7.8%) subjects (on treatment virologic failure:  n = 6; relapse:  n = 10) in the RBV-free regimen.  The difference between arms demonstrates that RBV contributes to the efficacy in genotype 1a-infected patients and suggests that 3-DAA + RBV is the optimal regimen for these patients.
Phase 3 Study in Cirrhotics:  Study M13-099
Study M13-099 is a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial in treatment-naïve subjects 
or subjects previously treated with pegIFN/RBV with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection with compensated (Child-Pugh A, score ≤ 6) cirrhosis.  The 3 DAAs + RBV were 
administered for either 12 or 24 weeks of treatment.
A total of 380 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug, of 
which 68.7% had HCV genotype 1a, 31.3% had HCV genotype 1b, 42.1% were treatment-naïve, 36.1% were prior pegIFN/RBV null responders, 8.2% were prior pegIFN/RBV partial responders, and 13.7% were prior pegIFN/RBV relapsers. 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
22
The SVR 12rates for subjects with compensated cirrhosis treated with 3-DAA + RBV for 
12 or 24 weeks were 91.8% and 95.9%, respectively.  Virologic failure was noted in 
13/208 (6.3%) subjects (on treatment virologic failure:  n = 1; relapse:  n = 12) receiving the 12-week regimen and 4/172 (2.3%) subjects (on treatment virologic failure:  n = 3; relapse:  n = 1) receiving the 24-week regimen.
Analyses of subgroups suggest that the overall difference in SVR
12rates was driven 
largely by a lower SVR 12rate among genotype 1a prior null responders who received 
12 weeks of treatment, while other subgroups had comparable response rates when treated 
for 12 or 24 weeks.  Thus, a 12-week treatment regimen is recommended for all patients with cirrhosis with the exception of genotype 1a prior null responders, for whom 24 weeks of treatment provides a higher SVR.
Integrated Safety Results
A summary of treatment-emergent adverse events from the pooled analyses of data from 
the phase 3 studies is presented in Table 2 .  A majority of subjects experienced at least 
one event, but most subjects experienced events that were mild in severity.  Rates of severe adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation were low across studies but numerically higher in the study of subjects with cirrhosis.

The most common adverse events regardless of causality are listed in Table 3 . 
Adverse events that occurred at a ≥ 5% incidence in the 3-DAA + RBV regimen versus 
the placebo were considered to be adverse drug reactions related to the study treatment.  
These include fatigue, nausea, pruritus, insomnia, asthenia, and anemia.  The frequency of these events was generally lower in the arm treated without RBV.  In general, rates of adverse events were similar in patients with cirrhosis versus patients without cirrhosis.

Transient elevations in total (predominantly indirect) bilirubin may occur due to ABT-450 
inhibition of the bilirubin transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and RBV-induced hemolysis.  The elevations generally peaked by Weeks 1 – 2, declined through the end of treatment and returned to within the normal range by 4 weeks post-treatment.  Rates of

hyperbilirubinemia were lower in subjects treated with 3-DAA without RBV compared to 
3-DAA with RBV.  The rates and degree of hyperbilirubinemia were higher in patients with cirrhosis, but the temporal pattern of elevation followed by resolution was similar and few were symptomatic (jaundice).  Rates of ≥ grade 2 hemoglobin reductions were 
6% among subjects without cirrhosis who received the 3-DAA + RBV regimen for 12 weeks, and 7% and 11% among subjects with cirrhosis who received the 3-DAA + RBV regimen for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively.  Grade 3 hemoglobin values were rare.  The decline in hemoglobin was largely managed with RBV dose reductions; use of hematologic growth factors and blood transfusion were rare.  The anemia reported in the clinical trials was primarily observed when the 3-DAA regimen was administered with RBV.
Transient asymptomatic post-baseline serum ALT elevations of > 5 × ULN occurred at a 
frequency of 1% across active treatment arms and were evaluated by an external hepatic panel.  The ALT elevations were asymptomatic, usually occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment and typically declined with ongoing treatment.  A disproportionate number of the cases were in women on concurrent systemic estrogen-containing therapy (i.e., contraceptives or hormone replacement) and discontinuation of the hormonal therapy with continuation or brief interruption of the DAA regimen led to resolution in serum ALT elevation.  Concomitant use of systemic estrogen-containing medications is a risk factor for these post-baseline elevations in serum ALT.  No ALT elevations greater than 5 times ULN were observed in subjects receiving progestins only or in subject receiving topical vaginal estrogen preparations.  Among the cases of serum ALT elevation thought to be related to the DAA regimen, none resulted in hepatic dysfunction and they generally resolved or improved with ongoing treatment.  All cases had resolved completely in the post-treatment follow-up.
ABT-450/ritonavir, ABT-267 (and its major, inactive human metabolites) and ABT-333 
had no effects on embryo-fetal development in rodent and/or nonrodent species at maximal feasible exposures that provided AUC multiples at least 4-fold higher than 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
26
exposures at the recommended clinical doses.  Clinical studies in women who are 
pregnant have not been conducted.
In summary, the 3-DAA regimen, with or without RBV, was well tolerated with a low 
discontinuation rate.  Adverse events were typically mild, and many of the adverse events and laboratory abnormalities observed were attributable to the presence of RBV.  Transient, asymptomatic serum ALT elevations were observed at a low rate, were not associated with hepatic dysfunction and generally resolved with ongoing treatment.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and 
drug-drug interactions can be found in the Investigator's Brochure for ABT-267, ABT-450, ABT-333 and product label for ritonavir and ribavirin .

The current study is intended to evaluate the long-term outcomes with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without RBV for treatment-naïve and IFN/RBV treatment-experienced adults with chronic HCV GT1 infection, with or without compensated cirrhosis.
3.1 Differences Statement
The combination of 3-DAA with or without RBV for 12 and 24 weeks was explored in 
treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced HCV GT1-infected subjects, with (12 and 24 weeks) or without  (12 weeks only) compensated cirrhosis,  in several phase 3 studies,  These Phase 3 studies have been conducted in a randomized, controlled, double-blind or open-label fashion.  This study is a Phase 3b, single arm, open-label study in approximately 600 treatment-naïve and IFN/RBV treatment-experienced subjects with or without compensated cirrhosis. 
This is the first study to evaluate SVR
12and clinical outcomes through 5 years following 
treatment with 3-DAA with or without RBV for 12 or 24 weeks in chronic HCV 
GT1-infected subjects.  The study population comprises HCV GT1a- and 1b-infected subjects in the United States who are treatment- naïve or IFN/RBV treatment-experienced.  The study will include up to 25% of subjects with compensated

M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
27
cirrhosis which approximates the projected prevalence among chronic HCV-infected 
subjects in the United States.15
3.2 Benefits and Risks
This Phase 3b study is a single arm study in which eligible HCV genotype 1-infected subjects will receive ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without RBV for either 12 or 24 weeks.  The combination of 3-DAA with or without RBV has been evaluated in several phase 3 studies.  Treatment with 3-DAA + RBV for 12 weeks resulted in SVR
12in 
96.2% of HCV GT1-infected, treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis in Study M11-646, and in 96.3% of HCV GT1-infected, pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced subjects without cirrhosis in Study M13-098.  In Study M13-961, 99.5% and 99.0% of HCV GT1b-infected treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis achieved SVR
12following treatment with 3-DAA with or without RBV for 12 weeks, 
respectively.  Similarly, in Study M13-389, 96.6% and 100% of HCV GT1b-infected pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced subjects without cirrhosis achieved SVR
12following 
treatment with 3-DAA, with or without RBV for 12 weeks, respectively.  ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without RBV was also evaluated in Study M14-002.  In Study M14-002, 97.0% and 90.2% of HCV GT1a-infected treatment-naïve subjects achieved SVR
12following treatment with and without RBV, 
respectively, suggesting that 3-DAA with RBV is the optimal regimen for HCV GT1a-infected subjects.  In this study, HCV GT1a infected subjects will receive 3-DAA with RBV.
The likelihood of successfully curing HCV in compensated cirrhotic subjects following 
treatment with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 coadministered with RBV was evaluated in Study M13-099.  In Study M13-099, 91.8% and 95.9% of HCV GT1-infected treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced subjects achieved SVR
12following treatment for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively.  Analysis of subgroups 
demonstrated that the difference in SVR 12rates between treatment arms was due to the 
lower SVR 12rate in GT1a-infected pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced prior null 
responders treated for 12 weeks.  Among HCV GT1a-infected subjects, partial responders 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
28
and relapsers had higher SVR rates than null responders in the 12-week treatment group, 
while similar SVR rates were seen among the null responders, partial responders and relapsers treated for 24 weeks.  SVR rates were high across all subgroups in HCV GT1b-infected subjects treated for 12 and 24 weeks.  For this reason, in previous versions of the protocol, HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis and who were prior null responders to IFN/RBV were assigned to receive 3-DAA with RBV for 24 weeks, while HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis who were not prior null responders to IFN/RBV were assigned to received 3-DAA with RBV for 12 weeks.  In order to align the treatment duration for subjects with GT1a infection and compensated cirrhosis with the recommended treatment duration that is found in the US prescribing information for the recently-approved AbbVie product containing the regimen included in this study (i.e., ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333), the protocol now specifies that all HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis will be assigned to receive 3-DAA with RBV for 24 weeks, unless a treatment duration of 12 weeks is selected by the investigator based on the subject's prior treatment history.  HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis who were assigned to 12 weeks of treatment under a previous version of this protocol will be assigned to 12 additional weeks of treatment unless 1) the investigator determines that a 12-week duration of therapy is appropriate based on the subject's prior treatment history; or 2) the subject has already completed the original study drug treatment and additional treatment cannot be initiated within 15 days of the date that the original treatment was completed.
ABT-450/r, ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without RBV have been well tolerated in the 
Phase 3 studies.  Adverse events that are known, and those not previously described, may occur with the DAAs or RBV as detailed in the informed consent for this study.  In addition, subjects may experience inconvenience or discomfort related to the study visits or study procedures.  
Risks associated with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 coadministered with or without 
RBV, including the risks of toxicity and virologic failure, appear limited and manageable 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
29
based on the results from the phase 3 studies.  Given the potential high rate of cure in 
HCV GT1-infected subjects, the risk-benefit profile is favorable.
4.0 Study Objectives
Primary Objective(s):
●To evaluate the effect of response to treatment (assessed by SVR 12status) on 
the long-term progression of liver disease in adults with chronic HCV GT1
infection who received treatment with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 
with or without ribavirin, as measured by all-cause death, liver-related death, 
liver decompensation, liver transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Secondary Objectives:
●To evaluate the percentage of subjects achieving a 12-week sustained virologic 
response, SVR 12(HCV RNA < lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] 12 weeks 
following treatment) in adults with chronic HCV genotype 1 (GT1) infection 
who receive treatment with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or 
without ribavirin.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, multi-center study designed together with companion study 
TOPAZ-I, which shares the primary objective of assessing the effect of treatment response on long-term clinical outcomes in adults with GT-1 chronic HCV infection with 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3

or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either treatment-naïve or IFN/RBV (IFN or 
peg IFN/RBV) treatment-experienced.  In both studies, subjects will be treated with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without ribavirin (RBV).
In the TOPAZ-I and TOPAZ-II studies, the primary objective is to assess the effect of 
treatment response (SVR
12) on long-term clinical outcomes, based on the data from both 
studies combined.  The studies differ based on geographic region (this study will be conducted in the US while the TOPAZ-I study will be conducted outside the US) and based on certain procedures that are not related to the primary outcome.  For example, this study will utilize a Subject Care Plan Model to facilitate subjects' adherence to the study drugs, and the TOPAZ-I study will assess the long-term change from baseline in liver elastography. 
Subjects will be considered to be non-cirrhotic based on a liver biopsy within 24 months 
prior to or during screening demonstrating the absence of cirrhosis (e.g., a METAVIR Score of 3 or less, Ishak score of 4 or less) or, if a liver biopsy is unavailable, a screening FibroScan
®result of < 12.5 kPa or a screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.72 and Aspartate 
Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) ≤ 2. 
Subjects will be considered to have cirrhosis based on previous histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on a liver biopsy (e.g., Metavir Score of > 3 [including 3 – 4 or 3/4], Ishak score of > 4) or, if a liver biopsy is unavailable, a screening FibroScan score ≥ 14.6 kPa or a 
screening FibroTest > 0.72 and APRI > 2. 
In the absence of a qualifying liver biopsy, subjects with a screening FibroScan result that 
is ≥ 12.5 kPa and < 14.6 kPa, a FibroTest result that is ≤ 0.72 and an APRI > 2, or a 
FibroTest result that is ≥ 0.73 and an APRI ≤ 2, should be evaluated based on the 
investigator's clinical judgment to determine the presence or absence of cirrhosis.
Subjects will be considered treatment-naïve if they have never received any antiviral 
treatment for hepatitis C infection.
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3

Subjects will be considered treatment-experienced if they have received prior IFN/RBV 
(IFN or pegIFN with RBV) excluding DAAs.  Subjects with HCV RNA levels that document the type of prior response to IFN/RBV treatment will be categorized as one of the following:
●Null-responder:  failed to achieve a 1 log
10IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA by 
Week 4 or a 2 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA by Week 12 during a prior 
IFN/RBV or pegIFN/RBV treatment course;
●Partial responder:  achieved at least a 2 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA 
by Week 12 during a prior IFN/RBV or pegIFN/RBV treatment course but 
failed to achieve HCV RNA undetectable at the end of treatment; 
●Relapser:  achieved HCV RNA undetectable at end of a prior IFN/RBV or 
pegIFN/RBV treatment course but HCV RNA was detectable following cessation of therapy.
Subjects with a less well-characterized IFN/RBV treatment experience, including those 
subjects with incomplete HCV RNA and treatment date documentation, will be categorized as one of the following:
●Prior relapse/breakthrough:  Achieved at least one documented result of HCV 
RNA undetectable during a prior IFN/RBV or pegIFN/RBV treatment course.
●Prior nonresponder:  Did not achieve a documented result of HCV RNA 
undetectable or HCV RNA was detected at the end of treatment during a prior 
IFN/RBV or pegIFN/RBV treatment course, with insufficient data available to 
categorize as a breakthrough, partial or null responder.
●IFN intolerant:  Did not meet any of the above definitions of treatment-failure 
and discontinued IFN/RBV or pegIFN/RBV therapy due to IFN or pegIFN intolerability.  
The study is designed to enroll approximately 600 subjects to meet scientific and 
regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.

At least 100, but no more than 150 subjects with fibrosis stage of F4 will be allowed to 
enroll.  At least 50, but no more than 110 subjects with fibrosis stage of F3 will be allowed to enroll.  The Metavir score system will be used to interpret the liver biopsy and determine the fibrosis stage.  In the absence of a liver biopsy, the equivalent Metavir score corresponding to the results of a screening FibroScan or FibroTest will be used to determine the baseline fibrosis stage as listed below:

APRI ≤ 2, should be evaluated based on the investigator's clinical judgment to determine the fibrosis stage (either 
F3 or F4).
The resulting Metavir score, as shown in the above table, will be documented via 
recording in the IRT system.  
After meeting the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled to either 12 or 24 weeks of 
treatment.

This study will also utilize a Subject Care Plan Model.  The Subject Care Plan Model is a 
mechanism that allows subjects to receive reminders for upcoming study visits, reminders to take study drugs, information about their HCV RNA values (if applicable) and/or receive disease specific education and encouragement at varying frequencies of contact.  
Subjects will be contacted by a designated nurse educator, contracted by the sponsor, 
throughout the trial.  The nurse educator may interact with subjects by phone, email, in-person visit, postal mail, text message or combinations of these listed communications to facilitate the assigned subject care plan level.  After enrollment, the subjects will undergo a Subject Care Plan assessment (as part of Subject Care Plan Model) that will be conducted by a designated nurse educator.  The care plan has three levels as detailed below:
Care Plan Level 1:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a low level of support 
will be assigned to Care Plan Level 1 and will be contacted approximately 2 to 
3 times per week.
Care Plan Level 2:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a moderate level of 
support will be assigned to Care Plan Level 2 and will be contacted approximately 
2 to 3 times per week and receive once daily study medication reminder.
Care Plan Level 3:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a high level of support 
will be assigned to Care Plan Level 3 and will be contacted approximately 3 to 
5 times per week and receive twice daily study medication reminders.
The designated nurse educator will assign a care plan level after their initial assessment 
and may adjust the care plan level as needed throughout the trial.  The Subject Care Plan Model support will continue until subjects have completed their Post-Treatment Week 12 Visit.  Details regarding Subject Care Plan Model are described in Section 5.3.1.1 .
The study will consist of a Screening Period (Section 5.1.1), Treatment Period 
(Section 5.1.2 ) and a Post-Treatment Period (Section 5.1.3 ).

5.1.1 Screening
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study specific procedures, will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system and will undergo the study procedures identified in Section 5.3.1 associated with the Screening Visit.  The investigator or his/her 
designated and qualified representatives will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 during the period from the 
Screening Visit through Study Day 1 prior to dosing and record the results of this assessment and the details of the informed consent process in the subject's medical records. 
Eligible subjects have up to 42 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into the study.
5.1.1.1 Rescreening
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria with the exception of up to three exclusionary 
laboratory parameters may rescreen once within the 42 day screening period without prior AbbVie approval.  However, subjects with any of the following exclusionary values will not be allowed to rescreen:  exclusionary HCV genotype, a positive hepatitis B surface antigen, positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, or confirmed pregnancy.  Subjects with more than three exclusionary laboratory results will require approval from the AbbVie Study Designated Physician prior to rescreening.  Subjects being rescreened because of an exclusionary laboratory parameter(s) must have the laboratory parameter(s) repeated within the same screening period.
For subjects who do not meet the study eligibility criteria, the site personnel must register 
the subject as a screen failure in both IRT and electronic data capture (EDC) systems.
5.1.2 Treatment Period (TP)
After meeting the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled to either 12 or 24 weeks of 
treatment as described in Section 5.1and Table 5 .

HCV GT1-infected subjects who are either treatment-naïve or previously treated with 
IFN/RBV (IFN or pegIFN with RBV) will receive ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333.  Subjects with HCV GT1a infection and all GT1-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis will receive RBV.  The treatment duration will be 12 weeks for all subjects except HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis, who will receive treatment for 24 weeks unless a treatment duration of 12 weeks is selected by the investigator based on the subject's prior treatment history.  Subjects will receive study drug regimens according to criteria listed in Table 5 .

* Note:  Follow the genotype 1a dosing recommendations in patients with an unknown genotype 1 subtype or with 
mixed genotype 1 infection.
** Treatment for 12 weeks may be considered for some patients based on prior treatment history (See response rates 
in GT1a cirrhotics by prior treatment history protocol Section 3.0, Table 1 ).
The site will enter subject's genotype (1b / Non-1b), fibrosis stage and prior IFN/RBV null responders and nonresponder information in the IRT system ( Table 5 ).
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV (if applicable) will be administered as described in Section 5.5.1 (Treatments Administered).  Subjects will receive instructions 
about the study at the Day 1 Visit.  The study drugs will be dispensed at the visits indicated in Table 7 .
After enrollment, all subjects will continue to return to the site on an outpatient basis for the study visits and procedures as identified in Table 7 .  Subjects could also return to the 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV

site as an unscheduled study visit for additional safety visits if the investigator feels 
necessary.  All subjects will be assigned to a care level based on the assessment as 
described in Section 5.3.1.1 (Subject Care Plan Model).  Sites should ensure that subjects 
adhere to the study visits listed in  Table 7 .  Subjects who cannot complete their study 
visit per the visit schedule should ensure they do not run out of study drug prior to their next study visit.  Compliance is critical to ensure adequate drug exposure.
Some of the Treatment Period study visits and visit activities (including but not limited to 
vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and concomitant medication assessment) may be conducted in the home or non-hospital/clinic environment by qualified individuals at the request of the Investigator, with approval from the Sponsor, and with the agreement of the subject.
Virologic failure criteria will be evaluated and applied by the Investigator as detailed in 
Section 5.4.3 .
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period should return for a Treatment Discontinuation Visit and undergo the study procedures as outlined in Table 7
and as described in Section 5.3.1.1 .  Ideally, this should occur on the day of study drug 
discontinuation, but is recommended to be no later than 2 days after their final dose of study drug and prior to the initiation of any other anti-HCV therapy if applicable.  Following completion or premature discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will enter the 260-week Post-Treatment Period.
The Treatment Period will assess safety, antiviral response, and clinical outcomes, 
including all-cause death, liver-related death, liver decompensation, occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation.
5.1.3 Post-Treatment (PT) Period
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drugs will enter into the 
Post-Treatment Period and return to the site on an outpatient basis for the study visits and procedures as identified in Table 7 .  The Post-Treatment Period will begin the day 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV

following the last dose of study drug treatment and last for approximately 260 weeks as 
outlined in Table 7 .  Subjects could also return to the site as an unscheduled study visit for 
additional safety visits if the investigator feels necessary.  Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue during the Post-Treatment Period should return to the site for a 
Post-Treatment discontinuation visit and undergo the study procedures as outlined in Table 7 and as described in Section 5.3.1.1 .
All subjects will continue to receive the assigned subject care plan until the completion of Post-Treatment Week 12 Visit.  Upon completion of Post-Treatment Week 12 Visit, all subjects in each care plan level will receive one final session with the nurse educator for final education.  Details regarding Subject Care Plan Model are described in Section 5.3.1.1 .
Some of the Post-Treatment Period study visits and visit activities (including but not limited to vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and concomitant medication assessment) may be conducted in the home or non-hospital/clinic environment by qualified individuals at the request of the investigator, with approval from the Sponsor, and with the agreement of the subject.
The post-treatment period will assess safety, antiviral response, and clinical outcomes, 
including all-cause death, liver-related death, liver decompensation, occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation.
5.2 Selection of Study Population
The study population consists of HCV genotype 1-infected adult subjects with or without 
compensated cirrhosis, who are treatment-naïve or IFN/RBV (IFN or pegIFN with RBV) treatment-experienced.

5.2.3 Prior, Concomitant, and Prohibited Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of screening, or receives during the study, must be recorded along with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage information including dose, route and frequency. 
During the Post-Treatment Period, all medications will be collected until 30 days 
following the last dose of study drugs.  Only anti-HCV medications and concomitant medications relevant to SAE of death will be collected thereafter.
The AbbVie Study Designated Physician should be contacted if there are any questions 
regarding concomitant or prior therapies.
5.2.3.1 Prior Therapy
Subjects may be either treatment-naïve or IFN/RBV (IFN or pegIFN with RBV) 
treatment-experienced.
Prior or current use of any investigational or commercially available anti-HCV agents 
other than IFN or RBV, including telaprevir, boceprevir, sofosbuvir, simeprevir or an investigational agent, excludes a subject from this study.  Subjects who previously participated in trials of investigational anti-HCV agents may be enrolled if they can produce documentation that they received only placebo.
5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications within 2 weeks or 
10 half-lives of the medication, whichever is longer, prior to initial study drug administration and through 2 weeks following discontinuation of study drugs.  Subjects 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
43
must review and sign an Informed Consent form prior to discontinuing any prohibited 
medications for the purpose of meeting study inclusion criteria.
The investigator or a qualified designee should confirm that a concomitant medication can 
be safely administered with DAAs (including ritonavir) and RBV (if applicable).  Some medications may require dose adjustments due to potential for drug-drug interactions.  The investigator or qualified designee should review concomitant medication(s) label(s) and should also utilize the drug-drug interactions (DDI) tool that will be provided by the sponsor to screen concomitant medications at each visit for potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) with study drugs.  The site should document their DDI review in the source or print report and maintain it in the subject's study files.
Management of hematologic growth factor therapy is the responsibility of the 
investigator; growth factors will not be provided by AbbVie, and AbbVie will not reimburse for the expense of growth factors or their use.
Investigators should refer to the package inserts for erythropoiesis stimulating agents for 
additional information regarding their use.
Prior to enrollment, subjects should agree to practice two effective methods of birth 
control while receiving study drugs starting with Study Day 1 and for 30 days after stopping study drug or for 6 months after stopping study drug if receiving RBV.  Subjects using systemic estrogen-containing medications (including estrogen containing oral contraceptives) have a higher risk for elevated ALT levels.  Subjects using these kinds of medications must discontinue them at least 2 weeks prior to initial study drug administration or 10 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer.  Subjects may replace the systemic estrogen-containing contraceptive with a progestin-only hormonal contraceptive method.
During the Post-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess concomitant medications.  
Subjects may revert to pre-study doses, at a minimum of 2 weeks following discontinuation of study drugs, if applicable.

5.2.3.3 Prohibited Therapy
In addition to the medications listed in Table 6 , use of known strong inducers of CYP3A 
or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 is prohibited within 2 weeks or 10 half-lives 
of the medication, whichever is longer, prior to the initial dose of study drugs and through the first 2 weeks after the subject has completed study drugs in the Treatment Period.
The investigator or a qualified designee should refer to the RBV labeling and DDI tool 
that will be provided by the sponsor for a list of prohibited medications.  The site should document their DDI review in the source or print report and maintain it in the subject's study files.  Anti-HCV medications other than those specified in the protocol will not be allowed during the Treatment Period of the study.
Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications.  Subjects must be 
consented prior to discontinuing any prohibited medications for the purpose of meeting study inclusion criteria.  During the Post-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess prohibited medications and subjects may resume previously prohibited medications or revert to pre-study doses, at a minimum of 2 weeks following discontinuation of study drugs, if applicable.

5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Table 7 are discussed in detail in this section with the 
exception of the assessment of concomitant medications (Section 5.2.3 ), and the 
collection of adverse event information (Section 6.4).  All study data will be recorded in 
the subject's source documentation and then on the appropriate eCRFs, with the exception 
of laboratory data which will be provided to the Sponsor electronically from the laboratory(ies).
Informed Consent and RBV Information
Signed study-specific informed consent will be obtained from the subject before any study 
procedures are performed.  Subjects taking RBV will be given the RBV Medication Guide (where applicable/locally available).  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Medical History
A complete medical history, including history of tobacco, nicotine containing products and alcohol use, will be taken from each subject during the Screening Visit.  An updated medical history will be obtained prior to study drug administration and will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at visits specified in Table 7 .  A 
symptom-directed physical examination may be performed at any other visit, when 
necessary.
The physical examination performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the baseline physical 
examination for clinical assessment.  Any significant physical examination findings after the first dose will be recorded as adverse events.

Vital Signs, Weight, Height
Body temperature, blood pressure, pulse and body weight will be measured at the visits 
specified in Table 7 , or upon subject discontinuation.  Blood pressure and pulse rate will 
be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes.  The vital signs performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.  The subject should wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing.  Height will only be measured at Screening; the subject will not wear shoes.
12-lead Electrocardiogram
A 12-lead resting ECG will be obtained at the Screening visit and will serve as the 
baseline assessment.  The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection.
The ECGs will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site ("local 
reader").  The local reader from the site will sign, and date ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
Normal ECG
Abnormal ECG – not clinically significantAbnormal ECG – clinically significant
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the 
subject's source.  The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine-generated measurements and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.  
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained at a minimum for the clinical laboratory tests outlined in Table 8
at the visits indicated in Table 7 .

Blood samples for serum chemistry tests should ideally be collected following a minimum 
8-hour fast at the following visits: Day 1, Final Treatment Visit, and PT Week 52, 104, 156, 208, and 260.  The remaining visits may be non-fasting.  
Subjects whose visits occur prior to the morning dose of study drug should be instructed 
to fast after midnight.  Subjects whose visits occur following the morning dose of study drug should be instructed to fast after breakfast until the study visit occurs.
At the Day 1 study visit, a fasting blood sample is to be collected prior to the first dose of 
study drug which is administered at the Day 1 study visit.  Blood samples should still be drawn if the subject did not fast for at least 8 hours.  Subjects should be reminded to eat prior to their first dose of study drug (e.g., suggest they bring a light snack).  Fasting status will be recorded in the source documents and on the laboratory requisition.  The baseline laboratory test results for clinical assessment for a particular test will be defined as the last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.
A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.  Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shipping of these samples will be provided by the central laboratory chosen for this study.  The certified laboratory chosen for this study is ICON.  Samples will be sent to the following address:

Pregnancy Test
Serum and urine pregnancy tests are not required for female subjects with documented 
prior bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or for subjects who are confirmed to be postmenopausal.  
Confirmation of postmenopausal status measured by FSH will be obtained at the 
Screening Visit only for all female subjects.
For females of childbearing potential:
●A serum pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening visit only and 
analyzed by the central laboratory.  
●Pregnancy testing will be performed as specified in Table 7 regardless of 
treatment regimen.
●Subjects that receive a RBV containing regimen will have pregnancy tests 
performed monthly throughout the Treatment Period and for a minimum of 6 months after the discontinuation of RBV, or according to the local RBV 
label and/or local treatment guidelines for RBV. 
●Urine pregnancy testing will be performed on-site during the study visit if 
there is a scheduled visit.  If there is not a scheduled study visit, subjects may 
either have pregnancy testing performed at the site as an unscheduled study 
visit or a urine pregnancy test may be conducted by the subject at home with a pregnancy test kit provided by the site.  If a urine pregnancy test is performed 
at home, site personnel should contact these female study subjects to capture 
the results of any study-related pregnancy tests in the source records only.
●If a urine pregnancy result is positive, a confirmatory hCG serum test should 
be collected and sent to the central lab.
Concomitant Medication Assessment
Use of medications (prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins and herbal 
supplements) from the time of signing the consent through 30 days after last dose of study drug will be recorded in the eCRF at each study visit indicated in Table 7 .  During the 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
54
Post-Treatment Period, all medications will be collected until 30 days following the last 
dose of study drugs.  Only anti-HCV medications and concomitant medications relevant
to SAE of death will be collected thereafter as indicated in Table 7 .  The investigator or 
his/her designated and qualified representatives should review concomitant medication(s) 
label(s) and should also utilize the DDI (drug-drug interactions) tool that will be provided by the sponsor to screen concomitant medications at each visit for potential drug interaction with study drugs.  The site should document their DDI review in the source or print report and maintain it in the subject's study.  The sites should refer to Section 5.2.3
(Prior, Concomitant, and Prohibited Therapy).
Hepatitis and HIV Screen
HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCVAb and anti-HIV Ab will be performed at Screening.  A positive anti-HIV Ab test must be confirmed.  The investigator or his/her representatives must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject.  The site will report these results per local regulations, if necessary.
HCV Genotype and Subtype 
Plasma samples for HCV genotype and subtype will be collected at Screening.  Genotype 
and subtype will be assessed using the Central lab. 
HCV RNA Levels
Plasma samples for HCV RNA levels will be collected as indicated in Table 7 and 
analyzed using the COBAS®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan®HCV Test, v2.0.  For this 
assay, the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) is 15 IU/mL.Liver Biopsy, FibroScan or FibroTest
At Screening, subjects should meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria before undergoing a liver biopsy if a historical biopsy is not available.
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
55
Subjects who have not had a liver biopsy within 24 months prior to screening, but who 
otherwise meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will undergo either a liver biopsy or non-invasive test (FibroScan or FibroTest/APRI prior to enrollment) to determine presence or absence of cirrhosis.  APRI should be calculated 
from samples drawn on the same day.   Selection of liver biopsy or non-invasive testing 
should be based on local standard practice.
FibroTest will be performed as indicated in Table 7 .
Child-Pugh Score and Category 
The Child-Pugh score will be calculated and documented at the Screening Visit for 
Cirrhotic subjects only.  Subjects who were considered to be non-cirrhotic at screening visit but identified as cirrhotic (according to definitions listed in Section 5.1) during the 
screening process will return to the site prior to the baseline visit for Child-Pugh assessment.
The Child-Pugh score uses five clinical measures of liver disease (3 laboratory parameters 
and 2 clinical assessments).  Child-Pugh score will be determined at the screening visit as indicated in Table 7 .  The Child-Pugh score will be automatically calculated prior to 
Day 1 by EDC RAVE once the investigator or designated site personnel enters the subject's parameters (as listed in Table 9 ).  A total score of 5 – 6 is considered Class A 
(compensated disease); 7 – 9 is Class B (significant functional compromise); and 10 – 15 is Class C (decompensated disease).

For subjects without cirrhosis:  Liver ultrasound will be performed at the Screening 
Visit, Post-Treatment Week 52, Post-Treatment Week 156 and Post-Treatment
Week 260.
Subjects with a historical negative liver ultrasound, CT or MRI (within 3 months prior to screening) are not required to undergo a screening ultrasound.
A positive Ultrasound result suspicious for HCC during the treatment or post-treatment 
period will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI. 
Assessment of Clinical Outcomes
The following clinical outcomes will be assessed during the study at visits outlined in 
Table 7 :
●All-cause death:  Death due to any cause.
●Liver-related death:  Death as the result of a liver-related cause, based on the 
opinion of the clinical site principal investigator.
●Liver transplantation:  Any subject who had undergone liver transplantation.
●Liver decompensation:  Development of any of the following conditions:  ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding.
●Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):  Any subject in whom, at any time during 
the study, HCC developed.  HCC is defined by histologic confirmation or a 
> 1 cm mass lesion on cross-sectional imaging that meets the diagnostic criteria of HCC according to AASLD guidelines .

Clinical Outcome events that occur during the Treatment Period through Post-Treatment 
Week 4 are to be recorded and documented in the AE/SAE eCRF (Section 6.0) in addition 
to being captured in the Clinical Outcome eCRF.  Clinical Outcome events that occur after Post-Treatment Week 4 are to be recorded in the Clinical Outcome eCRFs only, except when the clinical outcome is death, in which case the SAE eCRF would also need to be completed. 
An independent outcome committee will review and adjudicate the validity of each 
clinical outcome as per the charter.  
HCV Resistance Testing Plasma Sample
A plasma sample for HCV resistance testing will be collected at the study visits, indicated 
in Table 7 .  Specific instructions for preparation and storage of the samples will be 
provided by the central laboratory, the Sponsor, or its designee.
Subject Care Plan Model
The Subject Care Plan model is a mechanism that allows subjects to receive reminders for 
upcoming study visits, reminders to take study drugs, information about their HCV RNA values (if applicable) and/or receive disease specific education and encouragement at varying frequencies of contact.
Subjects will be contacted by a designated nurse educator, contracted by the sponsor, 
throughout the trial.  The nurse educator may interact with subjects by phone, email, in-person visit, postal mail, text message or combinations of these listed communications to facilitate the assigned subject care plan level.
The investigator or his/her designated site personnel will register each subject in the 
web-based care model portal after enrollment.  However, if the web-based portal is not operable, or the site information is not available in the portal, the nurse educator may obtain this information verbally from the site.  The subject profile form will collect broad 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
59
demographic information, including but not limited to, the subject's contact information 
and best time of contact. 
Once the subject profile is registered, the subject will be contacted after enrollment by the 
nurse educator, for administration of a brief care plan assessment that will be approximately 10 to 30 minutes in duration.
The nurse educator will make three contact attempts and if possible, will leave a voice 
message requesting the subject to call them back and/or allow the subject to also leave a voice message for the nurse educator.  If the subject cannot be reached after three attempts, the investigator or his/her designated site personnel will be notified and the nonresponsive subject will be assigned to care level 1 by the nurse educator.  Subjects who do not have access to internet or do not have email will be contacted by phone or postal mail.
After the completion of initial assessment, the nurse educator will assign each subject to 
one of the three care plan levels that may be adjusted throughout the trial dependent upon subject responsiveness, needs or request of the subject.  Each care plan level provides varying levels of support as outlined below for subjects during study drug treatment and will continue until the subject has completed Post-Treatment Week 12 Visit. 
Subject Care Plan Levels:
Care Plan Level 1:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a low level of support 
will be assigned to Care Plan Level 1 and will be contacted approximately  2 to 
3 times per week.
Care Plan Level 2:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a moderate level of 
support will be assigned to Care Plan Level 2 and will be contacted approximately 
2 to 3 times per week and  receive once daily study medication reminder. 
Care Plan Level 3:  Subjects that are assessed as requiring a high level of support 
will be assigned to Care Plan Level 3 and will be contacted approximately 3 to 
5 times per week and receive twice daily study medication reminders.
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3

Investigative site personnel will be notified of any subjects that cannot be reached after 
approximately two phone call attempts to perform any necessary follow-up (confirm subject status, verify contact information, etc.).  The site may enter subjects' scheduled visit dates, actual visit dates, concomitant medication, and treatment duration into the web-based portal.  The nurse educators or site personnel may use the web-portal as a resource to confirm that the subject is taking their AM and PM doses.
Upon completion of the Post-Treatment Week 12 Visit, all subjects in each care level will 
receive one final session with the nurse educator for final education.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Instruments (Questionnaires)
Subjects will complete the self-administered PRO instruments (where allowed per local 
regulatory guidelines) on the study days specified in Table 7 .  Subjects will be instructed 
to follow the instructions provided with each instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Subjects who are functionally unable to read or understand any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaires to them.  Site personnel will encourage completion of each instrument at all applicable visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
In this study, PRO instruments will be consistently presented so that subjects will 
complete the Short-Form 36 Version 2 health survey (SF-36v2) instrument first, and the FACIT–F instrument second.  PRO instruments should be completed as of the first study procedure at each visit and prior to any discussion of adverse events or any review of laboratory findings, including HCV RNA levels.
Short Form 36 – Version 2 Health Survey (SF-36v2)
The SF-36v2 is a non-disease specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 
instrument with extensive use in multiple disease states.  The SF-36v2 instrument comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a subject's functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
61
social functioning, role emotional and mental health) with a recall period of 4 weeks.  
Domain scores are aggregated into a Physical Component Summary score and a Mental Component Summary score.  Higher SF-36v2 scores indicate a better state of health.  Completion of the SF-36v2 should require approximately 10 minutes.
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT–F)
The FACIT–F is a symptom specific instrument with a focus on measuring fatigue in a 
variety of chronic diseases or health conditions.  It was originally developed from interviews with oncology patients and clinical experts to assess anemia-associated fatigue.  Its 13-item-version assesses peripheral, central, or mixed fatigue with a recall period of 7 days and yields a summed total score ranging between 0 and 52.  Higher FACIT–F scores indicate a lesser degree of fatigue.  Completion of the FACIT–F (version 4) should require approximately 5 – 10 minutes.
Assignment of Subject Numbers
A subject number is assigned at screening via IRT.  Screening numbers will be unique 
4-digit numbers and will begin with 1001, with the first 2 digits representing the investigative site and the last 2 digits representing the subjects at that site.  Enrolled subjects will keep their screening number as their subject number.
Study Drug Dispensation
Study drugs will be dispensed at the visits as indicated in Table 7 .
Study Drug Returned for IRT Reconciliation 
At each visit noted in Table 7 , the number of tablets of ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333, 
and RBV (if applicable) remaining in each kit (blister card for DAAs or bottle for RBV) 
will be entered into the IRT system.  Additional information regarding treatment compliance can be found in Section 5.5.6 .

Table 7 .  Archive plasma and serum samples are being collected for possible additional 
analyses, including but not limited to, study drug or metabolite measurements, viral load, safety/efficacy assessments, biomarkers of inflammation, HCV gene sequencing, HCV resistance testing, and other possible predictors of response, as determined by the Sponsor.
Specific instructions for preparation and storage of archive samples will be provided by 
the central laboratory, the Sponsor, or its designee. 
5.3.1.2 Blood Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis
IL28B Sample
One (required) 4mLwhole blood sample for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation will 
be collected from each subject at screening for Interleukin 28B (IL28B) pharmacogenetic analysis and related markers.  If the sample is not collected at this visit, it may be collected at any time throughout the study.  This sample will not be used for any testing other than IL28B genotypes.
Specific instructions for sample collection and storage will be provided by the central 
laboratory, the Sponsor, or its designee.  Samples will be used only for IL-28B testing and then destroyed.

The following safety evaluations will be analyzed during the study:  adverse event 
monitoring and vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory test assessments.
5.3.4 Pharmacogenetic Variable
IL28B status will be determined for each subject and analyzed as a factor contributing to 
the subject's response to study treatment.  These IL28B genotype results may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of IL28B and response to ABT-450, ABT-267, ABT-333, or drugs of these classes.  The results may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to IL28B and study treatment, or drugs of these classes.

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.
Subjects that discontinue study regardless of cause should be contacted (minimally as a 
telephone assessment) at each scheduled yearly visit to collect the survival status only if they provide consent.  Details regarding informed consent are provided in Section 9.3.
If the subject prematurely discontinues during the Treatment Period or the Post-Treatment Period, the procedures outlined for the applicable Premature D/C Visit should be completed as defined in Table 7 .  Ideally for study drug discontinuation, this should occur 
on the day of study drug discontinuation, but no later than 2 days after their final dose of study drug and prior to the initiation of any other anti-HCV therapy.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment.  The last dose of any study drug and reason for discontinuation from the Treatment Period will be recorded in the EDC (electronic data capture) system.  
If a subject has an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved laboratory result that is 
significantly outside of the reference range at the time of study drug discontinuation, the investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved.
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject 
reports becoming pregnant during the Treatment Period, the administration of RBV (if applicable) to that subject must be discontinued immediately and DAAs may be continued 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
65
at the principal investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if the benefit of 
continuing DAAs is felt to outweigh the potential risk.  Specific instructions regarding subject pregnancy can be found in Section 6.6.  Subjects will be monitored for SVR in the 
Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.2 .  The investigator is also encouraged 
to report the pregnancy information to the voluntary RBV Pregnancy Registry, if applicable.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intendedtermination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.  
If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the 
investigator and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination.
5.4.3 Discontinuation of Subjects Meeting Virologic Failure 
Criteria 
The following criteria will be considered evidence of virologic failure.  Subjects 
demonstrating any of the following will be discontinued from study drug:
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV 
RNA measurements of > 1 log
10IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during 
treatment;
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ LLOQ) at any point during treatment after HCV RNA 
< LLOQ
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
66
Confirmatory testing, where required, should be completed as soon as possible.  Also, 
when confirmation is required, the subject should remain on study treatment until the virologic failure has been confirmed.
If any of the above criteria are met while on DAA therapy, the subject will discontinue 
study treatment as described above.  If the investigator believes the virologic failure is due to study drug interruption and/or is compliance related, the AbbVie Study Designated Physician should be contacted to discuss alternative management.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
ABT-450/r/ABT-267 will be provided by the Sponsor as 75 mg/50 mg/12.5 mg tablets.  
ABT-450/r/ABT-267 will be taken orally as 2 tablets once daily which corresponds to a ABT-450 150 mg/ritonavir 100 mg/ABT-267 25 mg dose.  ABT-333 will be provided by the Sponsor as 250 mg tablets.  ABT-333 will be taken orally as 1 tablet twice daily, which corresponds to a 250 mg dose BID.
RBV will also be provided as 200 mg tablets.  Ribavirin is dosed based on weight, 
1000 to 1200 mg divided twice daily per local label.  For example, for subjects weighing < 75 kg, RBV may be taken orally as 2 tablets in the morning and 3 tablets in the evening which corresponds to a 1000 mg total daily dose.  For subjects weighing ≥ 75 kg, RBV 
may be taken orally as 3 tablets in the morning and 3 tablets in the evening which corresponds to a 1200 mg total daily dose.
For subjects with CrCl ≥ 30 to < 50 mL/min, RBV should be given as alternating daily 
doses of 200 mg and 400 mg as described in Section 6.7.6 ; Table 13 ).

The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only 
within the context of this study.  The study drugs supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or returned to the Sponsor.  Upon receipt of study drugs, the site will acknowledge receipt within the IRT system.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
At the Screening Visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the 
use of IRT.  For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria (or who are unable to enroll before enrollment has closed), the site personnel must contact the IRT system and identify the subject as a screen failure.
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
enrolled into the study on Study Day 1.  Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number assigned at the Screening Visit throughout the study.  For enrollment of eligible subjects into the study, the site will utilize the IRT system in order to receive unique study drug kit numbers.  The study drug kit numbers will be assigned according to schedules computer-generated before the start of the study by the AbbVie Data and Statistical Sciences Department.
Contact information and user guidelines for IRT use will be provided to each site.  Upon 
receipt of study drugs, the site will acknowledge receipt in the IRT system.

5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the doses for this study is discussed in Section 5.5.1 .  Study drug dosing will 
be initiated at the Study Day 1 Visit.  ABT-450/r/ABT-267 will be dosed QD and 
ABT-333 will be dosed BID.  Thus with normal dosing, 2 ABT-450/r/ABT-267 tablets and 1 ABT-333 tablet should be taken in the morning, and 1 ABT-333 tablet should be taken in the evening.  RBV (if applicable) will be dosed BID.  
All study drugs should be dosed together and administered with food at approximately the 
same times in the morning every day, i.e., the AM dose of ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV (if applicable) should be taken together with food and the PM dose of ABT-333 and RBV (if applicable) should be taken together and with food.  
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open-label study.5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than those described in the protocol.
All study drugs will be dispensed to subjects by study-site personnel under the direction 
of the investigator.  At the start of the study, each subject should receive counseling regarding the importance of dosing adherence with the treatment regimen with regard to virologic response and potential development of resistance.  The start and stop dates of all study drugs will be recorded in the source documents and eCRFs.
During the Treatment Period, subjects will be instructed to bring all study drug kits (full, 
partial or empty) to the study site at each study visit.  The study site personnel will inspect the contents of the bottles and blister cards at Study Visits defined as Study Drug Returned for IRT Reconciliation in Table 7 and record the status of each one as well as 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
70
the exact number of remaining tablets of ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 or tablets of 
RBV (if applicable) and the date of reconciliation in the IRT system.  If poor adherence is 
noted, the subject should be counseled and this should be documented in the subject's source.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The investigator or his/her representative will verify that study drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts using the IRT system.  A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be kept by the investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives and will include lot number, number of tablets dispensed, subject number, username of person who dispensed study drug and date dispensed for each subject.  Final accountability will be verified by the monitor at the end of study drug treatment at the site.
During the study, should an enrolled subject misplace or damage a study drug kit, the IRT 
system must be contacted and informed of the misplaced or damaged study drug.  If the kit is damaged, the subject will be requested to return the remaining study drug to the site.  Replacement study drug may only be dispense d to the subject by contacting the IRT 
system.  Study drug replacement(s) and an explanation of the reason for the misplaced or damaged study drug(s) will be documented within the subject source documentation.  Study drug start dates for each drug and the last dose of the regimen will be documented in the subject's source documents and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  The status of each kit, number of tablets remaining in each one returned, and the date of reconciliation will be documented in the IRT system at Study Visits defined as Study Drug Returned for IRT Reconciliation in Table 7 .  The monitor will review study drug accountability on an 
ongoing basis.
Upon completion of or discontinuation from the Treatment Period, all original study drug 
bottles (containing unused study drugs) will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed on site.  All destruction procedures will be according to instructions from the Sponsor and according to local regulations following completion of drug accountability 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
71
procedures.  The number of tablets of each type of study drug returned in each kit will be 
noted in the IRT system.  Labels must remain attached to the containers.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
The combination regimen of ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without RBV for 
12 and 24 weeks has been evaluated in treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced HCV GT1-infected subjects, with or without compensated cirrhosis, in the Phase 3 studies.  Based upon the results from Studies M11-646, M13-098, M13-961, M13-389, M14-002 and M13-099 (discussed in detail in Section 3.0), AbbVie 
plans to evaluate the same combination regimen used in the Phase 3 studies in a study population of treatment-naïve and IFN/RBV treatment-experienced HCV GT1-infected subjects, with or without compensated cirrhosis.  The intention of this study is to assess the effect of treatment response on long-term clinical outcomes and evaluate the SVR
12
following treatment with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333, with or without RBV.  Given the above considerations, it is anticipated that the study design will maximize the SVR rates in the population.  As such, the absence of randomization, blinding and control groups is appropriate.  No hypothesis testing is planned; statistical analyses will be descriptive.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.  HCV 
RNA assays are standard and validated.  The SF-36v2 and FACIT–F instruments are standard in the literature and thoroughly validated in the general population and in subjects who have chronic health conditions.  The SF-36v2 health survey is the standard Health-related Quality of Life instrument in hepatitis C subjects worldwide and FACIT–F has been used in hepatitis C registration clinical trials as an assessment tool for fatigue.

5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
This study plans to enroll both HCV treatment-naïve and IFN/RBV treatment-experienced 
subjects with genotype 1 chronic HCV, with or without compensated cirrhosis.  The subject population to be studied is reflective of the current demographics of chronic HCV infection in the United States.  Moreover, this study population has been evaluated in the phase 3 studies where more than 2,300 subjects received the combination regimen that is planned to be administered in this study.  In the Phase 3 studies, treatment with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with RBV for 12 weeks resulted in SVR
12in 96% to 
99% of HCV GT1-infected, treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis, and 96% to 100% of HCV GT1-infected, pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced subjects without cirrhosis.  Similarly, high SVR
12rates (99% to 100%) were seen in HCV GT1b-infected 
treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced subjects without cirrhosis following treatment with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333, without RBV for 12 weeks.  Among subjects with compensated cirrhosis, 92% and 96% of HCV GT1-infected treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced subjects achieved SVR
12
following treatment with ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 with RBV for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively.  The DAA regimen ABT-450/r, ABT-267 and ABT-333 with or without RBV have been well tolerated in the Phase 3 studies, as evidenced by the low rate of treatment discontinuation and serious adverse events.  
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333:
Doses of the three DAAs to be used in this study have been administered in the Phase 3 
Studies M11-646, M13-098, M13-389, M13-961, M14-002 and M13-099 have shown high SVR
12rates in combination with each other, with or without RBV, with a favorable 
safety profile.  The maximum dose of ABT-450/r/ABT-267 75 mg/50 mg/12.5 mg tablets will not exceed 150 mg/100 mg/25 mg per day for 24 weeks.  The maximum dose of ABT-333 250 mg tablets administered in this study will not exceed 500 mg per day for 24 weeks.  
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
73
RBV
The daily dose of RBV (if applicable) in this study is 1000 or 1200 mg, divided 
twice daily, and based on subject weight.  This dose is approved for treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C infection in combination with pegIFN.  The same dose was studied in the Phase 3 Studies M11-646, M13-098, M13-389, M13-961, M14-002 and M13-099 and was found to be generally safe and well tolerated and resulted in high SVR rates. 
The maximum RBV dose administered in this study will not exceed 1200 mg, divided 
twice daily for 24 weeks.
6.0 Adverse Events
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being related to study drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Definitions
6.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
74
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.7regarding toxicity 
management)] and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition or the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
Protocol-defined clinical outcomes consist of:
●All-cause death:  Death due to any cause.
●Liver-related death:  Death as the result of a liver-related cause, based on the 
opinion of the clinical site principal investigator.
●Liver transplantation:  Any subject who had undergone liver transplantation
●Liver decompensation:  Development of any of the following conditions:  ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding.
●Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):  Any subject in whom, at any time during 
the study, HCC developed.  HCC is defined by histologic confirmation or a 
≥1 cm mass lesion on cross-sectional imaging meets the diagnostic criteria of 
HCC according to AASLD guidelines.

M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
75
Clinical Outcome events that occur during the Treatment Period through Post-Treatment 
Week 4 are to be recorded and documented in the eCRF as an AE/SAE in addition to being captured in the Clinical Outcome eCRF(s).  Clinical Outcome events that occur after Post-Treatment Week 4 are to be recorded in the Clinical Outcome eCRFs only, except when the clinical outcome is death, in which case the SAE eCRFs would also need to be completed.
These outcomes will form part of the study endpoints and will be reported in the clinical 
study report at the end of the study.  
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
76
Important Medical 
Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples 
of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
6.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts 
the subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the 
subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or 
life-threatening.
6.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of DAAs (ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333)  and to the use of RBV (if applicable):
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
77
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the investigator for a serious adverse event.
6.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related non-serious adverse events will be 
collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study treatment has elapsed, all adverse events and serious adverse events will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  After Post-Treatment Week 4 until the end of the study, only SAE of death will be collected.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

with the subject, if the benefit of continuing therapy is felt to outweigh the potential risk 
(Section 5.4.1 ).
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected for pregnancies occurring up to 30 days after the end of treatment with DAAs only, or 6 months (or per local RBV label) after the last dose of RBV for treatment with DAAs plus RBV.  The investigator is encouraged to report the pregnancy information to the voluntary RBV Pregnancy Registry, if RBV is included within the regimen.
Subjects who discontinue study medications due to pregnancy will be monitored for SVR 
in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3 .
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.7 Toxicity Management
For the purpose of medical management, all adverse events and laboratory abnormalities 
that occur during the study must be evaluated by the investigator.  A table of Clinical Toxicity Grades for evaluating laboratory abnormalities is provided in Appendix C .  This 
table should be used in determination of the appropriate toxicity management as discussed in Sections 6.7.1 through 6.7.5 .
A drug-related toxicity is an adverse event or laboratory value outside of the reference range that is judged by the investigator or the Sponsor as having a "reasonable possibility" of being related to the study drug (Section 6.3).  A toxicity is deemed "clinically 
significant" based on the medical judgment of the investigator.  Laboratory abnormalities will be managed as deemed clinically appropriate by the investigator until satisfactory resolution.
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
81
Investigators should avoid interrupting study drugs for more than 7 consecutive days.  The 
Investigator should ensure that any study drug interruptions or RBV (if applicable) dose modifications and associated adverse events are promptly entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
The toxicity management guidelines below should be followed throughout the Treatment 
Period of the study.
6.7.1 Grade 1 or 2 Laboratory Abnormalities and Mild or Moderate 
Adverse Events
Subjects who develop a mild or moderate adverse event or Grade 1 or 2 laboratory 
abnormality, other than those discussed separately in Section 6.7.4 (Management of 
Decreases in Hemoglobin) for subjects receiving RBV, Section 6.7.5 (Management of 
ALT Elevations), and Section 6.7.6 (Creatinine Clearance) may continue study drugs with 
follow-up per study protocol and in accordance with local standard of care.
6.7.2 Grade 3 or 4 Laboratory Abnormalities 
With the exception of Grade 3 or higher abnormalities of total bilirubin, uric acid, 
phosphorus, total cholesterol, triglycerides, or glucose (in subjects with a history of diabetes), if a subject experiences a Grade 3 or greater abnormal laboratory parameter during the Treatment Period, the abnormal laboratory test should be repeated.  If the Grade 3 or greater abnormality is confirmed, the investigator should assess whether the abnormality can be managed medically without interruption of study drug, or whether study drugs should be interrupted and the laboratory parameter followed until it improves.  If study drugs are interrupted and restarted and the abnormality recurs, then study drugs should be permanently discontinued. 
Decreases in serum hemoglobin or in calculated creatinine clearance or elevations of 
serum ALT should be managed according to the guidance in Section 6.7.4 , Section 6.7.5 , 
, and Sectio n 6.7.6 below.  Grade 3 or greater abnormalities of total bilirubin, uric acid, 
phosphorus, total cholesterol, triglycerides or glucose (in subjects with a history of 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
82
diabetes) should be managed medically as appropriate and do not require confirmation or 
study drug interruption unless deemed necessary by the investigator.
6.7.3 Severe Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events
If a subject experiences a severe adverse event or a serious adverse event that the 
investigator considers to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug, the investigator should assess whether the adverse event can be managed medically without interruption of study drug, or whether study drugs should be interrupted until the event improves.  If study drugs are interrupted and restarted and the adverse event recurs, then study drugs should be permanently discontinued. 
If a subject experiences a severe adverse event or serious adverse event that is considered 
unrelated (no reasonable possibility) to the study drugs, it is not necessary to interrupt study drugs unless an interruption is required because of the nature of the event (e.g., unable to take oral medications).  
The investigator should ensure that all serious adverse events are reported to AbbVie 
within 24 hours of awareness.  Serious adverse event follow-up information, including associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations), must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of awareness by entering updated SAE information into the appropriate eCRFs. 
Severe adverse events and any associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations) should 
be entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
6.7.4 Management of Decreases in Hemoglobin
For subjects not receiving ribavirin:
Hemoglobin decreases should be managed according to grade based on the guidance in 
Section 6.7.1 and Section 6.7.2 above.
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
83
For subjects receiving ribavirin:  
Reductions in hemoglobin are a well characterized side effect of ribavirin exposure.  If a 
subject receiving the standard dose of RBV experiences a hemoglobin decrease meeting one of the criteria outlined in Table 12 , a confirmatory test should be performed.  If the 
hemoglobin decrease is confirmed, the management guidelines in Table 12 should be 
followed.  Management will be different for subjects without a history of known cardiac disease and subjects with known cardiac disease.  Subjects experiencing decreases in hemoglobin that do not meet the criteria outlined in Table 12 may need hemoglobin 
evaluations at more frequent intervals at the discretion of the investigator.  
The dose of RBV should not be further modified in subjects with creatinine clearance 
< 50 mL/min who are receiving a reduced dose of RBV.  Reductions in hemoglobin in these subjects should be managed as medically appropriate and as outlined in Table 12 .
Use of hematologic growth factors (such as erythropoietin or filgrastim) or blood transfusions are permitted at the discretion of the investigator.  Management of hematologic growth factor therapy is the responsibility of the Investigator, and growth factors will not be provided by AbbVie.
Alternate management of hemoglobin decreases outside of these criteria is permitted with 
approval of the AbbVie Study Designated Physician.

Table 12. Ribavirin Dose Modification Guidelines in Management of 
Hemoglobin Decreases
Hemoglobin Value Intervention
Subjects with creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min
< 10 g/dL and ≥ 8.5 g/dL Reduce RBV dose.*  Study drugs may be 
continued.  If hemoglobin increases to ≥ 10 g/dL, 
may increase RBV; with gradual dose increases in 
200 mg increments towards original dose
< 8.5 g/dL Interrupt ribavirin.  Manage the subject as 
medically appropriate.
If hemoglobin increases to ≥ 8.5 g/dL, RBV may 
be restarted.
Additional guidance for subjects with history of stable cardiac disease and creatinine clearance 
≥50 mL/min
Hemoglobin decrease of ≥ 2 g/dL during any 
4-week treatment periodReduce RBV dose.*  If a subsequent hemoglobin 
result is greater than the level that triggered the 
dose reduction, RBV dose may be increased; with 
gradual dose increases in 200 mg increments 
< 12 g/dL after a 4-week RBV dose reduction Interrupt ribavirin.  Manage the subject as 
medically appropriate.
If hemoglobin increases to ≥ 12 g/dL, RBV may 
be restarted.
For subjects with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min
< 10 g/dL Interrupt RBV.  Manage the subject as medically 
appropriate.If hemoglobin increases to ≥ 10 g/dL, RBV may 
be restarted.  If creatinine clearance increases to 
≥50 mL/min, refer to guidance above.
*1stdose reduction of ribavirin is by 200 mg/day.  If needed, 2nddose reduction of ribavirin is by an additional 
200 mg/day.  Subjects whose dose of ribavirin is reduced to 600 mg daily receive one 200 mg tablet in the morning 
and two 200 mg tablets in the evening.
6.7.5 Management of ALT Elevations
Transient asymptomatic grades 3 – 4 ALT elevations have been observed in 
approximately 1% of subjects receiving ABT-450/r-containing regimens.  If a subject experiences a post-baseline increase in ALT to > 5 × ULN that is increased from the 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
85
previous measurement, the subject should have a confirmatory ALT measurement 
performed. 
If the ALT increase is confirmed to be > 5 × ULN and increased from the previous 
measurement, the recommendations below should be followed:
●Evaluate for alternative etiology of ALT elevation:  update medical history and 
concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable), and obtain additional testing as 
appropriate.
●Manage the subject as medically appropriate.
●Repeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and INR within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
●Discontinue study drugs if any of the following is observed at any time:
○ALT level is > 20 × ULN
○Increasing direct bilirubin, increasing INR, or onset of symptoms/signs of 
hepatitis.
Alternate management of ALT increases is permitted with approval of the AbbVie Study 
Designated Physician.
6.7.6 Creatinine Clearance
If calculated creatinine clearance (by Cockcroft-Gault formula) is confirmed to have 
decreased to < 50 mL/minute, (in a subject with a baseline creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min), or to below 30 mL/minute (in a subject with a baseline creatinine clearance 
< 50 mL/min), medical evaluation should include a full review of current medications, including those taken on an as needed basis, those which are sold over the counter and any dietary and herbal supplements, and appropriate dose reduction or discontinuation based on impaired renal function should be done (if applicable).  Ribavirin dose should be adjusted as in Table 13 .  Alternative management of RBV dose in the setting of reduced 
renal function will require approval of the AbbVie Study Designated Physician.
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
86
The investigator should also consider whether drug-drug interactions with concomitant 
medications may have contributed to the decrease in creatinine clearance, and whether discontinuation or substitution of the possible interacting drug might be needed.  For example, drug interactions between DAAs and some antihypertensive medications could potentially increase exposures of the antihypertensive, which may lead to reduction in renal function.  If anti-hypertensive medications are adjusted, vital signs should be monitored to ensure appropriate blood pressure control.  Refer to Section 5.2.3 for 
additional information regarding drug-drug interactions.
Table 13. Dosing of RBV in Subjects with Renal Impairment
CrCl Value RBV Dose
30 – 50 mL/min Alternating doses, 200 mg and 400 mg every other day.
< 30 mL/min 200 mg daily
Hemodialysis 200 mg daily
If creatinine clearance improves, the site should perform all necessary readjustment of any 
dose modifications that have been made.  If creatinine clearance improves to above the level that triggered the RBV dose reduction, RBV dose may be increased accordingly.
The Investigator should ensure that any concomitant medication changes, RBV dose 
reductions, and study drug discontinuations, as well as consequent related adverse events are entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
Clinical Toxicity Table will be appended to protocol in Appendix C .  
7.0 Protocol Deviations
AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol.  The 
principal investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified) after a subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notifying Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Independent Review

drug.  The primary efficacy analysis on clinical outcomes will be performed on all 
subjects in the ITT population. 
The ITT-II population will consist of all subjects enrolled in this study only who receive 
at least one dose of study drug.  All other efficacy, safety, resistance and demographic analyses will be performed on all subjects in the ITT-II population.  
No data will be imputed for any efficacy or safety analyses except for the PRO 
questionnaires and for analyses of the HCV RNA endpoints.  If a respondent answers atleast 50% of the items in a multi-item scale of the SF-36v2, the missing items will be imputed with the average score of the answered items in the same scale.  In cases where the respondent did not answer at least 50% of the items, the score for that domain will be considered missing.  Similarly, the missing items of the FACIT–F questionnaire will be imputed with the average score of the answered items in the same scale as long as more than 50% of the items in the scale were answered.  The SF-36v2 Mental and Physical Component Summary measures will not be computed if any domain is missing.  
HCV RNA values will be selected for the SVR
12analysis based on the defined visit 
windows.  When there is no HCV RNA value in a visit window based on defined visit 
windows, the closest values before and after the window, regardless of the value chosen for the subsequent and preceding window, will be used for the flanking imputation described below. 
If a subject has a missing HCV RNA value at a post-baseline visit but with undetectable 
or unquantifiable HCV RNA levels at both the preceding value and succeeding value, the HCV RNA level will be considered undetectable or unquantifiable, respectively, at this visit for this subject.  In addition, if a subject has an unquantifiable HCV RNA level at the preceding value and an undetectable HCV RNA level at the succeeding value, or vice versa, the HCV RNA level will be imputed as unquantifiable at this visit for this subject.  Subsequent to this flanking imputation, if a subject is missing a value for the visit window associated with the analysis, the subject will be imputed as a visit failure (i.e., not undetectable or unquantifiable).  For SVR
12analysis, if there is no value in the appropriate 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV
M14-222 ProtocolAmendment 3
89
window but there is an HCV RNA value after the window, then it will be imputed into the 
SVR 12window.
8.1.1 Demographics
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects in the ITT 
population.  Demographics include age, weight, height, and BMI, and the frequency of gender, race and ethnicity.  Baseline characteristics will include HCV genotype 1 subtype (1a, 1b, other), IL28B genotype ([CC, CT, or TT] and [CC or non-CC]), treatment history (treatment-naïve  [IFN-eligible, IFN-ineligible] or IFN/RBV treatment-experienced [null responder, partial responder, relapser, prior relapse/breakthrough, prior nonresponder, IFN-intolerant]), baseline HCV RNA levels [(continuous) and ( ≤ 800,000 IU/mL or 
> 800,000 IU/mL)], baseline HOMA-IR (< 3 mU × mmol/L
2or ≥ 3 mU × mmol/L2), 
baseline fibrosis stage (F0-1, F2, F3, F4), tobacco (user, ex-user, or non-user) and alcohol use (drinker, ex-drinker, or non-drinker) status.  Summary statistics (N, mean, median, SD, and range) will be generated for continuous variables (e.g., age and BMI) and the number and percentage of subjects will be presented for categorical variables (e.g., gender and race).  
8.1.2 Efficacy
The primary efficacy analysis on clinical outcomes will be performed on all subjects in 
the ITT population.  All other efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT-II population.
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by the central 
laboratory using the COBAS
®AmpliPrep HCV assay version 2.0.  For this assay, the 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) is 15 IU/mL.
Incidence of all-cause death, liver-related death, liver decompensation, liver 
transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma as defined in protocol Section 5.3.1.1 will 
be collected during the 5-year (PT Week 260) Post-Treatment Period.

8.1.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint is to assess the effect of response to treatment on clinical 
outcomes by comparing the time to incidence of the following events between subjects who achieve SVR
12and those who do not using a Cox regression model:
●All-cause death
●Liver-related death
●Liver decompensation
●Liver transplantation
●Hepatocellular carcinoma
●Composite of any of the above outcomes
The primary analysis will be conducted among subjects in the ITT population as described in Section 8.1.
8.1.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
1. The percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after 
the last actual dose of study drug).  The simple percentage of subjects achieving 
SVR 12will be calculated and a two-sided 95% confidence interval of the 
percentage will be computed using the Wilson score method for the binomial proportion.  
2. The mean change from baseline in quality of life and fatigue to Post-Treatment 
Week 12 and to the Post-Treatment Week 24 (assessed by Short-Form 36 Version 2 health survey [SF-36v2] and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue [FACIT–F] questionnaires) will be assessed by subjects' fibrosis stage at baseline.

Summary statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum and maximum) at Baseline and each 
applicable visit will be provided.  In particular, the comparison of the mean change from baseline to Post-Treatment Week 12 and to Post-Treatment Week 24 in the SF-36v2 Vitality domain score, SF-36v2 Mental Component Summary Score and Physical Component Summary score and in the FACIT–F score among subjects who had different fibrosis stage at baseline will be performed using ANCOVA analyses with baseline fibrosis stage (F0-F1, F2, F3 and F4) as factor and baseline PRO score and SVR
12status as covariates.
3. Adherence to each tablet type (ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333, and RBV) during 
the Treatment Period will be calculated as the percentage of tablets taken relative to the total tablets expected to be taken for each tablet type.
8.1.2.3 Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup efficacy analyses on the clinical outcomes and the percentage of subjects 
achieving SVR
12will be performed as appropriate and useful.
8.1.2.4 Additional Efficacy Endpoints
The following additional efficacy endpoints will be summarized and analyzed:
●The number and percentage of subjects meeting each and any of the following 
SVR 12non-response category:
○On-treatment virologic failure (rebound or fail to suppress)
○Relapse
○Premature study drug discontinuation with no on-treatment virologic 
failure
○Missing SVR 12data 
○Other
●Additional analysis on the PRO data will be performed as useful and appropriate.

8.1.3 Resistance
For subjects who do not achieve or maintain SVR 12and who are included in the analyses 
described below, the sample closest in time after virologic failure with an HCV RNA 
level ≥ 1000 IU/mL will be used if the HCV RNA level at the time of failure is 
< 1000 IU/mL.  The prototypic reference strains with their associated GenBank Accession IDs for sequence analyses are genotype 1a-H77 (NC_004102) and 1b-Con1 (AJ238799).
For each DAA target, resistance-associated signature amino acid variants will be 
identified by AbbVie Clinical Virology.  Amino acid positions where resistance-associated variants have been identified in vitro and/or in vivo are 1) for ABT-450:  36, 43, 56, 155, 156, and 168 in NS3 for genotype 1a; 56, 155, 156, and 168 in NS3 for genotype 1b; 2) for ABT-267:  28, 30, 31, 32, 58, and 93 in NS5A for genotype 1a; 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 58, and 93 in NS5A for genotype 1b; and 3) for ABT-333:  316, 414, 446, 448, 451, 553, 554, 555, 556, 558, 559, and 561 in NS5B for genotype 1a; 316, 368, 411, 414, 445, 448, 553, 556, 558, and 559 in NS5B for genotype 1b.
The following definitions will be used in the resistance analyses:
●Baseline sample:  sample collected before the first dose of DAA study dru g.
●Baseline variant:  a variant in the baseline sample determined by comparison 
of the amino acid sequence of the baseline sample to the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA target (NS3, NS5A, or 
NS5B).
●Post-baseline variant:  an amino acid variant in a post-baseline time point 
sample that was not detected at baseline.
●Linked variant by population sequencing:  variants at 2 or more signature resistance-associated amino acid positions identified within a target by population sequencing, and no mixture of amino acids is detected at any of 
these positions.

For those samples evaluated, a listing by subject of all baseline variants relative to 
prototypic reference sequence at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions will be provided for each DAA target (NS3, NS5A, and/or NS5B).  In addition, a summary of the number and percentage of subjects with each baseline variant at a signature resistance-associated amino acid position within each target by HCV subtype out of the total number of baseline samples sequenced will also be provided.
The HCV amino acid sequence at post-baseline time points with an HCV RNA level of 
≥1000 IU/mL that are analyzed will be compared to the baseline and appropriate 
prototypic reference amino acid sequences.  Listing by subject and time point of all post-baseline variants at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions relative to the baseline and to the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequences will be provided. 
Linkage between variants at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions by 
population sequencing will also be evaluated.  A listing by subject and time point of the linked variants by population sequencing will be provided.  In addition, a summary of the number and percentage of subjects with linked variants within each target by HCV subtype out of the total number of baseline samples sequenced will be provided.
The persistence of resistance-associated substitutions that emerged for each target (NS3, 
NS5A, and NS5B) will be assessed by population sequencing at selected post-treatment time points in a subset of subjects.  Listings by subject and time point of all post-baseline variants at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions relative to the baseline amino acid sequence will be provided for each DAA target (NS3, NS5A, and NS5B).
8.1.4 Safety
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety 
analyses.

8.1.4.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug through 30 days post-study drug dosing) will be tabulated by primary MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events by severity rating and relationship to study drug will also be provided.  Subjects reporting more than one adverse event for a given MedDRA preferred term will be counted only once for that term using the most severe incident for the severity rating table and the most related for the relationship to study drug table.  Subjects reporting more than one type of event within a SOC will be counted only once for that SOC.
Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.1.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Data
Clinical laboratory tests will be summarized at each visit.  The baseline value will be the 
last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.  Mean changes from baseline to each Post-Baseline Visit will be summarized descriptively.
Laboratory data values collected during the Treatment Period will be categorized as low, 
normal, or high based on reference ranges of the laboratory used in this study.  The number and percent of subjects who experience post-baseline shifts during treatment in clinical laboratory values from low/normal to high and high/normal to low based on the normal range will be summarized.
In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting 
pre-specified criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant laboratory values during treatment will be summarized.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.

8.1.4.3 Vital Signs Data
Mean changes in temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and weight 
from baseline to each Post-Baseline Visit will be summarized descriptively.  Number and percentages of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-defined criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant vital signs values during treatment will be summarized.  
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Assuming 4% of subjects do not achieve SVR
12and assuming the 5-year composite event 
rate of all clinical outcomes is 20% in non-SVR 12subjects and 75% of reduction in SVR 12
subjects (Hazard Ratio of 0.25),16,17then based on two sample log rank test in EAST 6.0, 
a sample size of at least 2,000 subjects overall enrolled in the TOPAZ-I and TOPAZ-II 
studies provides greater than 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between SVR
12and non-SVR 12subjects in the rate of clinical outcome events.  Power 
calculations were based on a dropout rate of up to 20%.
8.3 Randomization Methods
This is a single arm, open-label study.  Therefore, there is no randomization in this study.  
Enrolled subjects will receive treatment per the planned study schematic outlined in Section 5.1.  Enrolled subjects will also receive a Care Plan based on the level assessment 
as described in Section 5.3.1.1 .  The Care Plan level may be adjusted as needed 
throughout the trial until subjects have completed their Post-Treatment Week 12 visit.
9.0 Ethics

Subsection Methodology:
Add:  new eleventh paragraph
HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis who were assigned to 12 weeks 
of treatment under a previous version of this protocol will be assigned to 12 additional weeks of treatment unless 1) the investigator determines that a 12-week duration of therapy is appropriate based on the subject's prior treatment history; or 2) the subject has already completed the original study drug treatment and additional treatment cannot be initiated within 15 days of the date that the original 12-week treatment was completed.
Section 3.2  Benefits and Risks
Second paragraph, last sentence previously read:
For this reason, HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis and who were 
prior null responders to IFN/RBV will receive 3-DAA with RBV for 24 weeks.
Has been changed to read:
For this reason, in previous versions of the protocol, HCV GT1a-infected subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis and who were prior null responders to IFN/RBV were assigned to receive 3-DAA with RBV for 24 weeks, while HCV GT1a-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis who were not prior null responders to IFN/RBV were assigned to received 3-DAA with RBV for 12 weeks.  In order to align the treatment duration for subjects with GT1a infection and compensated cirrhosis with the recommended treatment duration that is found in the US prescribing information for the recently-approved AbbVie product containing the regimen included in this study (i.e., ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333), the protocol now specifies that all HCV GT1a-infected subjects with 
ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333 and RBV

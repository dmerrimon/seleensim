Objective  The purpose  of this clinical  evaluation  is to collect  patient  outcome  data on a 
commercially available 510K FDA cleared advanced skin substitute. The 
commercially available product is Helico ll® Advanced Skin Substitute.  
In this trial  two group s of subjects with  Wagner 1  diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), 
will receive standard of care (SOC) treatment for their condition .  Half of the 
patients will have their SOC treatment with  Epifix ® or Grafix ® and the other 
half will receive a 510K FDA  cleared Helico ll® Advanced Skin Substitute as 
the primary treatment . The primary endpoint is the percentage  wound  area 
reduction  of the target ulcer.  Secondary endpoint s include the proportion of 
subjects that obtain complete closure over the 5 -week treatment period, the 
time to achieve complete wound closure of the target ulcer by the end of 5 
weeks, and mean number of IP applications.  
Intervention 
Groups  Group 1: SOC primary dressing with Helico ll®  
Group 2: SOC primary dressing with Epifix ® or Grafix ®

 Safety  Analysis:  
- The number  and type of Treatment  Emergent  Adverse  and Serious 
Adverse Events  
Safety  There is no formal safety objective for this study as Helico ll®,  Epifix ® and 
Grafix ® are commercially available, 510K FDA cleared product s for 
application on diabetic foot wounds.   However, there is the possibility of 
disease transmission due to the risk of viral infection upon application of an 
allograft -tissue -derived skin substitute.  Therefore, in accordance with FDA 
regulations, adverse reactions to the product  will be recorded  and provided  to 
the study  Sponsor  for required  FDA reporting and will be concurrently 
reported to all Investigators and IRBs.  
Adverse  events  associated  with the application  of standard  of care dressing 
will be collected during the course of the study.  
Collection  and reporting  of any adverse  reaction  data,  in accordance  with FDA 
regulations and adverse events associated with product application will  
ensure study subject safety.  
Surveillance 
Schedule  Subjects will undergo a screening  visit to determine eligibility. Eligible 
subjects will then undergo up to a 5-week treatment  phase  involving  weekly  
evaluations over 5 weeks  and after 5 weeks, will exit the study.  A dditional 
weekly visit s will occur  during the 2nd and 3rd week .   
Study 
Duration  It is estimated  that about  3 months will be required  to complete  the study  with 
data collection and reporting.

Page 12 of 63  Confidential  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Costs  of Non-healing  Diabetic  Foot Ulcers  
The economic  burden  of DFUs  costs  the United  States  over $50 billion  each  year.1 The cost 
to treat one patient with DFUs ranges from $11,700 to $16,883.2 Although approximately 
70% of DFUs are shown to heal with good SOC, at least 30% become chronic wounds.3 
These non -healing wounds are at greater risk for infection and lower extremity amputation.4 
Consequently, improved treatment options are important for patients with chronic DFUs to 
improve patient outcomes, lower treatment costs and reduce the risk of complications.  
1.2 Helicoll ®  Advanced Skin Substitute  
Helicoll ® Semi -Occlusive, Self-Adhering  and Sterilized Type -I Collagen Sheet for Wound 
Treatments  and Chronic Ulcers.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE  
Helicoll ® is a translucent, off -white, semi -occlusive, self -adhering and pre -sterilized  
Type -I Collagen Sheet for use as a bioactive membrane. H elicoll®  is flexible with  
moderate tackiness. H elicoll®  is a reconstituted collagen sheet free of contaminants  
like lipids, elastin,  and other immunogenic proteins (US Patented).  
Helicoll ® is 510K cleared (K040314) for use in diabetic foot ulcers and a range of other 
acute and chronic wounds.

2 RATIONALE  FOR  STUDY  
Helicoll ® is an advanced skin substitute device that is  510K cleared for application  on 
diabetic foot wounds and has been shown in case studies and clinical practice to assist in 
wound healing.  Therefore, based on this early promising data, a 24 subject RCT is 
necessary to further validate these case studies and identify the likelihood of wound healing 
with weekly  or as needed  application. For consistency, one type of wound , Wagner 1,  will be 
studied in this trial and DFUs  have been chosen as they are some of the most common 
wounds seen in wound  clinics.

Page 15 of 63  Confidential  4 STUDY  DESIGN  
This study is a prospective, multi -center, RCT designed to collect patient outcome data on 2 
commercially available SOC dressings for the treatment of DFU s.   
There  are two  standard of care  arms in the study:  
 
Arm 1: The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact 
casting [TCC] if the subject’s foot is too large for a CAM  boot), appropriate sharp or surgical 
debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in conjunction with 
debridement)  and wound  care covering  with Helicoll ® applied weekly or as needed followed 
by a padded 3 -layer dressing comprised of first layer - non-adherent and porous, second 
layer – absorbent 4x4 gauze pads  & third layer - soft roll and compressive wrap (Dynaflex™ 
or equivalent).  
 
Arm 2: The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact 
casting [TCC] if the subject’s foot is too large for a CAM boot), appropriate sharp or surgical 
debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in conjun ction with 
debridement)  and wound  care covering  with Epifix ® or Grafix ® followed by a padded 3 -layer 
dressing comprised of first layer - non-adherent and porous, second layer – absorbent 4x4 
gauze pads  & third layer - soft roll and compressive wrap (Dynaflex™ or equivalent).  
The study  involves  two phases:  Screening  and Treatment.  
4.1 Phase  1: Screening  
The Screening Ph ase is designed to determine whether subjects are eligible  to proceed  to 
the Treatment Phase  of the study  and consists  of a series  of screening assessments 
designed to determine eligibility.  
At the Screening  Phase  Visit (SV1),  written  informed  consent  (ICF)  from the subject  will be 
obtained by the Investigator or suitably qualified designee before any protected health 
information is obtained and prior to the performance of any protocol -specific procedures.  
After obtaining ICF, the  Investigator will select the  study target ulcer. Each  subject will have 
only one DFU selected  as the target  ulcer.  If the subject  has more  than one DFU at the SV1 
visit, the Investigator will select the largest DFU that meets the eligibility criteria of the 
protocol as the target ulcer.  If the subject meet s all eligibility criteria at the  Screening Visit , 
then the Screening Visit  and first Treatment visit may occur on the same day.     
4.2 Phase  2: Treatment  
The Treatment Phase (up to 5 weeks) begins with a series of assessments designed to 
confirm the subject’s continued eligibility. Investigators will debride the  target  ulcer, in 
accordance with SOC if required. Subjects whose ulcers continue to meet eligibility criteria 
will then be randomized to one of two groups: (1) SOC  with Helicoll ® primary dressing  
applied  weekly or as needed per investigator discretion  or (2) SOC with Epifix ® or Grafix ® 
applied  weekly  or as needed  per investigator discretion .

Page 16 of 63  Confidential  4.3 Subject  Treatment  Assessments  
4.3.1  DFU Assessments  
During the Treatment Phase, subjects will be evaluated on a weekly basis, with the 
exception of week 2 and 3 where the patient will be seen twice weekly. Weekly/Twice -
Weekly patient outcome evaluations include the Investigator’s assessment of target ulcer 
healing and measurements  of ulcer  size using  a ruler  to measure  wound  area and provide  
photos of wounds, including photos of healed wounds.  
Note:  All procedures  required  during  Screening  are included  in TV1 prior to the first 
treatment visit if  the subject fulfills eligibility criteria . 
Other  evaluations  during  the Treatment  Phase  are detailed  in the procedures  section.  
Subjects  will be seen  weekly  (± 2 days)  until the ulcer  is healed  or they meet  protocol  criteria 
to exit the study with the exception of the 2nd and 3rd week of treatment where the subject will 
be seen twice .  For both groups, assigned treatment  will be applied only once during the 2nd 
and 3rd week  unless the investigator feels an additional application is necessary . If the 
additional application is not necessary,  the additional  visit will involve a dressing change and 
wound evaluation.   
4.3.2  Wound  Healing  Assessment  
Initial  and confirmation  evaluations  of wound  healing  will be subject  to oversight  by the study 
chair who will review all photographs of healed wounds and confirm wound healing.  
4.4 Study  Subjects  
This prospective randomized trial will randomize 24 subjects  in up to 5 centers  located in the 
USA.  
4.4.1  Inclusion  Criteria  
Potential  patients  are required  to meet  all the following  criteria  for randomization  into the 
study:  
1. Subjects  must  be at least 18  years  of age  or older.

Visit CRF.  
4.5.7  Missed  Visits  
If a subject  misses  a visit, the site is to make  every effort  to have  the subject  return  as soon  as 
possible to make up the visit. Once the subject is seen, he/she is to return to his/her original 
weekly visit schedule. For example, if a subject was seen regularly on Mondays but missed a 
scheduled Monday  visit and came  in on  Wednesday, he/she  should return the  next Monday  to 
maintain his/her weekly Monday visit schedule.

FAILURE  
5.1 Subject  Completion  
▪ A subject  whose  target  ulcer  has closed  will be considered  as having  completed  the study  
▪ A subject  who completes  the Treatment  Phase  but still has an unhealed  target  ulcer  will be 
considered as having completed the study  
▪ A subject  who does  not complete  the Treatment  Phase  and still has an unhealed  target 
ulcer will be considered as not completing the study  
5.2 Success  and Failure  
▪ A subject  whose  ulcer  heals  sooner  than 5 weeks  with periodic assessment on a twice 
weekly/weekly basis  will be considered a treatment success .  The relative success  of 
healing  in percentage will be measured for each subject using  the following calculation:  
Percentage of Healing = (Actual days to heal / 28) X 100  
▪ A subject  whose  ulcer  has failed  to heal by 5 weeks  will be considered  a treatment  failure  
▪ A subject  who experiences  an amputation  of the affected  ulcer  area is also considered  a 
treatment failure  
5.3 Premature  Withdrawal  from  the Study  
A subject  who is randomized into the Treatment  Period  of the study  but who does  not 
complete the study has prematurely discontinued.  
All subjects  have  the right to withdraw  at any point  during  treatment  without  prejudice.  It will  be 
documented whether or not each subject completes the study. If for any subject, study 
treatment or observations were discontinued, the reason(s) will be recorded.  
The Investigator  can discontinue  a subject  at any time if it is considered  medically  necessary. 
In addition, the subject will be withdrawn from the study, if any of the following events occur:  
▪ A subject  is significantly  non-compliant  with the requirements  of the protocol  
▪ A subject  becomes  pregnant  or does  not confirm  use of birth control.  (Note:  the pregnancy 
will be followed up to term for safety. Relevant safety information collected after the study 
has been completed will be reported as supplemental information.)  
▪ A subject  has revascularization  surgery  on the lower  extremity  on which  the target  ulcer  is 
located  
▪ The subject’s  target  ulcer  deteriorates  and is infected  to the point  where  there  is exposed 
bone  
▪ An infection  episode  lasting  more  than two weeks  with no response  to allowable 
treatments  
Premature  withdrawal  from the study  may occur  if: 
▪ A subject is  treated  with a prohibited  medication.  This decision  will be made  by the 
Investigator as to whether premature withdrawal is warranted.  
Every attempt should be made to collect follow -up information. The reason for treatment 
discontinuation  or withdrawal  from the study  will be recorded  in the source  documents  and on 8/6/202411:05:38PMEDTSubramanianGunasekaranEnCollCorp

Page 27 of 63  Confidential  the appropriate CRF.  
Before  a subject is  identified  as lost-to-follow  up, the site should  make  all reasonable  efforts  
to contact the subject. Three follow -up attempts are required. These attempts must be 
documented and should include two phone calls and one certified letter.  
In the event  that a  subject is  prematurely  discontinued  from the study  at any  time due to an 
adverse effect or adverse event, the procedures in Section 10  of this protocol must be 
followed.  
5.4 Screen  Failures  
A subject who has signed a consent form, has been assigned a screening number, but is not 
entered into the treatment phase of the study  is classified as a screen failure. Subject 
number, demography and reason for screen failure will be collected. Subjects who fail their 
first screening attempt may be re - screened  again  (i.e., up to two screenings  total)  and may 
be enrolled  if they are found  to meet all inclusion and none  of the exclusion criteria. 
Rescreening follows a subject, not a specific wound, so subj ects cannot be screened > 2 
times for different wounds. Anytime a subject screen fails and later rescreens, they must be 
re-consented for the study.

Directions  For Use 
Helicoll ® comes in a sterile double packaging as a transparent pliable sheet. It has a back  
and a top protection cover sheet of medical grade synthetic polymer.  
 
Upon opening the sterile package, the top sheet of polymer can be removed carefully  
and the remaining can be soaked in sterile water or normal saline solution for 5 to 10  
minutes to easily remove the backing sheet.  
 
Prepare wound area using standard methods to ensure wound is free of debris and  
necrotic tissue. An initial surgical debridement of the wound may be necessary to ensure  
the wound edges contain viable tissue.  
 
Do not apply ointment or any greasy cream on the site prior to Helicoll ®. Do not try to  
over stretch the membrane.  
 
Helicoll ® can be applied on either of its surfaces and it adheres to the wound instantly. In  
case of dry wounds, sprinkle sterile saline solution on the surface and apply  
If there is a need to retain the skin -substitute in place, the perimetry can be taped, sutured or  
stapled as preferred by the doctor. If a secondary dressing is required, a non -adherent gauze  
with or without antibiotic can be placed to prevent unwanted adherence of the bandage to  
Helicoll ®. 
 
Repeated application on every 2nd or 3rd day like a typical wound dressing is not required,  
unless the wound is infected or accumulates excessive exudate underneath, which can be  
drained by making slit openings in the Helicoll ® product.  
 
Depending on the treatment modality, sometimes Helicoll ® may remain intact and gets peeled  
off as the wound heals, which may carefully be removed by moistening with saline soaked  
gauze for a few minutes. However, in some cases, Helicoll ® may get incorporated into the  
wound bed in about 4 to 5 days resulting in complete absorption of Helicoll ®. 
 
For donor site application, after surgical removal of donor tissue, arrest bleeding by  
conventional methods, clean the site and apply Helicoll ®. 
 
Oral or systemic antibiotics may be given as prescribed in infected cases and in non -infected  
cases as a preventive measure for better and faster results.  
 
CAUTION:  Always handle Helicoll ® using aseptic techniques. Helicoll ® should not be applied  
until excessive exudate, bleeding, acute swelling, and infection is controlled. If air pockets  
appear beneath the applied Helicoll ®, it can be gently pressed and removed using sterile  
methods. In case of localized bulging due to fluid accumulation beneath Helicoll ®, a small  
incision can be made to exude fluid. This incision can be patched with a small piece of  
Helicoll ® adhering to the original applied Helicoll ® sheet. After application, use an appropriate,  
non-adherent, secondary dressing to maintain a moist wound environment. Frequency of  
secondary dressing change will depend on the volume of exudate produced and the type of  
dressing used. Do not forcibly remove sections of Helicoll ® that may adhere to the wound.  
Helicoll ® may form a caramel -colored gel, which can be rinsed away with gentle irrigation.  8/6/202411:05:38PMEDTSubramanianGunasekaranEnCollCorp

6.4  Epifix® Product Information  
 
Description  
Human amniotic membrane is a thin, collagenous membrane derived from the 
placenta, the area in which the human fetus grows and develops within the mother’s 
uterus. Human amniotic membrane consists of multiple layers.  
EpiFix is a minimally manipulated, dehydrated, non -viable cellular amniotic membrane 
allograft that contains multiple extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, cytokines 
and other specialty proteins present in amniotic tissue to provide a barrier memb rane 
that enhances healing.  
EpiFix allografts are human tissue products and appearance may vary between 
donors. Variations in color (tan to light brown), opacity, and thickness are normal due 
to the nature of human tissue.  
 
Tissue Uses  
EpiFix Amniotic Membrane Allograft is intended for homologous use in the treatment of acute and 
chronic wounds to reduce scar tissue formation, modulate inflammation, provide a barrier, and 
enhance healing.

ENC-HEL-DFU -02 
Version  1.0 Date:  June 7 , 2024   
Page 33 of 63  Confidential  Contraindications  
EpiFix should not be used on (1) areas with active or latent infection and/or (2) a patient with a disorder 
that would create an unacceptable risk of post -operative complications.  
 
Precautions/Warnings   
• EpiFix  allografts remain suitable for transplantation in an unopened, undamaged package, under 
proper storage conditions.  
• Please inspect the integrity of the package upon receipt. If package and contents appear defective or 
damaged in any way, immediately contact the distributor.  
• This allograft is intended for single -patient use only. Discard all unused material.  
• The procedure should be performed by an authorized medical professional.  
• Strict donor screening and laboratory testing, along with dedicated processing and sterilization 
methods, are employed to reduce the risk of any disease transmission. However, as with all biological 
implants, an absolute guarantee of tissue safety is not  possible. This allograft has the potential to 
transmit infectious disease to the recipient.  
• The reaction of the body to any biological implant is not completely understood.  
• Caution should be used when treating patients with a known sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics. 
• Discard all damaged, mishandled or potentially contaminated tissue.  
• This product has not been tested in combination with other products.  
• DO NOT RE -STERILIZE.  
 
Preparation, Reconstitution and Use   
Prior to implantation, carefully follow the EpiFix allograft preparation steps below using aseptic 
technique:  
 
Wound Bed Preparation   
• Ensure the wound is free from clinical signs of infection.  
• Prepare wound bed as needed.  
 
Removing EpiFix from Packaging   
• The outer peel pouch is NOT sterile. The inner pouch that contains EpiFix is sterile (unless the 
pouches are damaged or compromised).  
 • Carefully open the peelable corner of the outer pouch and extract the inner pouch using aseptic 
technique. Ensure the inner pouch does not come in contact with any portions of non -sterile surface of 
the outer pouch.  
• Using aseptic technique, SLOWLY peel a corner of the inner peel pouch and grasp EpiFix with 
fingers or non -toothed, sterile forceps.  
• Use EpiFix promptly after opening the inner, sterile pouch.  
 
PLEASE TAKE GREAT CARE WHEN REMOVING EpiFix FROM THE INTERNAL POUCH. EpiFix 
IS THIN AND EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT .  
 
EpiFix Preparation   
1. In a dry state, use sterile dry scissors to cut EpiFix  to fit within the wound margins. It is acceptable to 
overlap the wound margins with EpiFix by 1mm.  
2. EpiFix can be applied wet or dry.  
3. EpiFix can be hydrated while on the wound site with sterile saline solution. Simply apply several 
drops of sterile solution to EpiFix. During and following hydration, the embossment on EpiFix will begin 
to fade.

ENC-HEL-DFU -02 
Version  1.0 Date:  June 7 , 2024   
Page 34 of 63  Confidential   
EpiFix Orientation & Application   
EpiFix should be placed on the wound site, using the orientation of the embossment lettering as a 
guide. Proper orientation of EpiFix can be noted when the embossment nomenclature reads correctly 
from left to right. If the mesh process has diminished the a bility to clearly read the embossment, the 
following two alternate methods may be used for placement:  
1. An elongated, horizontal perforation is located in the top left area of the graft connecting two 
adjacent perforations. Proper orientation can be noted when the graft is placed on the wound site 
such that this horizontal perforation remains visually in the top left area of the graft.  
2. The clear side of the inner pouch is indicative of the UP side of the graft orientation. Proper 
placement can be achieved by removing the graft from the pouch with the clear side up and 
moving to the wound site with that same orientation.  
Absorbable, non -absorbable suture material and/or tissue adhesives can be used to fixate EpiFix to the 
wound site, if desired.  
 
Primary Dressing   
• EpiFix should be covered with a non -adherent contact layer.  
• EpiFix should NOT be disturbed, if possible, for several days or before the next application, if needed. 
• If an infection occurs at the graft site, treat infection per institution’s protocol. Secondary Dressing  
• EpiFix requires a moist wound environment. Use appropriate moisture management dressings for the 
wound type and treatment ideology.  
 
Support Therapies   
• EpiFix is compatible with offloading/compression/negative pressure therapies.  
• EpiFix can be used in conjunction with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  
 
Re-application of EpiFix   
• It is recommended that EpiFix grafts are applied weekly until wound epithelialization is achieved. 
However, clinician discretion should be used based on patient and wound condition/progress. It is 
clinically acceptable to apply EpiFix on a biweekly basis  if desired.  
 
Adverse Effects & Reporting   
• As with any procedure, the possibility of infection exists.  
• Proprietary processing and validated sterilization methods are employed to eliminate potential 
deleterious components of the allograft. However, as with all biological implants, the possibility of 
rejection exists.  
• Any adverse reactions, including the suspected transmission of disease attributable to this allograft, 
should be reported immediately to MiMedx®.  
 
Acceptable Storage   
EpiFix allografts should be stored in a clean, dry environment at ambient conditions. EpiFix allografts 
have a 5 year shelf life. Check the label for the expiration date.

7 STANDARD OF CARE, CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS, 
EXCLUDED/ALLOWED  THERAPIES/MEDICATIONS  AND  ALLOWED  
DRESSINGS  
Beginning  at the screening  visit, ALL subjects  must have  their target  ulcer  managed  using  the 
SOC procedures noted below.  
7.1 SOC  Procedures  
7.1.1  Cleaning  the Target  Ulcer  
Remove all dressings. The leg should be elevated for as much time as possible during this 
process. Wash the foot with sterile water or saline solutions. Gently irrigate the target ulcer 
prior to each  dressing  change  with the same  solution.  Wound  cleansers  containing  antiseptics 
(examples: Hypochlorous Acid, Vashe, ExSept, PrepIt, etc.) are prohibited for use during the 
duration of this study.  
During  the Treatment  Phase,  the washing  and cleaning  of the DFU  must  be done  prior to 
application of SOC primary dressing . 
 
For the TV2 and TV3 additional visit  where application of a new Helicoll ® does not occur, the 
primary dressing will be lifted from the wound site along with the Helicoll® Advanced Skin 
Substitute  or Epifix ® or Grafix ®.  If the Helicoll® Advanced Skin Substitute is adherent to the 
wound, moisten gently with saline before attempting to remove. Cleaning of the target ulcer 
as noted above is suggested, however debridement should be limited,  and it is suggested  that 
only a very gentle  removal  of any slough  be performed at the investigator discretion.  Digital 
Photography is then take n and the Helicoll® Advanced Skin Substitute or Epifix ® or Grafix ® 
and primary dressing should be placed back on the wound. If the primary dressing is soiled or 
damaged a new primary dressing can be applied.   
7.1.2  Debridement  of the Target Ulcer  
Debridement is an essential technique and SOC in the treatment of DFU. It is important to 
remove  all non-viable  and necrotic  material  from the target  ulcer  prior to enrolling  the patient. 
Debridement is allowed during the treatment phase at the treating Investigator’s discretion. 
For detailed  guidelines  please  see Appendix  E as well as recommendations  for debridement 
during the 2nd visit in week 2 and 3 in which a new Helicoll ® is not placed.  
7.1.3  Offloading  
Offloading  is essential  if the wound  is to heal. A  diabetic  offloading  CAM  boot will  be given  to 
each subject, and this may be augmented with felt or foam to offload the ulcer or if the 
subject cannot be accommodated into a CAM boot, a TCC will be provided.  
Subjects will be educated on the importance of using the device to offload their DFU and 
instructed  on keeping  dressings dry  and to call or visit the study  site if the dressing  becomes 
soiled,  wet or is removed.  In addition,  subjects  should  be educated  on wound  infection  and if 
they observe infection, to call or visit the study site.  
7.2 Concomitant  Medications  
The subject may be administered any necessary medications, at the discretion of the 
Investigator; provided such medications are not applied topically to the target ulcer surface 
(topical  medication  can be applied  to other  surfaces  around  the ulcer or  other  non-reference 
ulcers).  8/6/202411:05:38PMEDTSubramanianGunasekaranEnCollCorp

Each  abnormality  will be recorded,  and the Investigator  will record  an assessment  of its 
clinical significance.  
8.3.5  Vital Signs  
The following  vital signs  will be collected:  
▪ Height  
▪ Weight  
▪ Seated  blood  pressure  (take  after the subject  has been  seated  for at least  5 minutes)  
▪ Pulse  
▪ Temperature  
8.3.6  Pregnancy  test 
Females  who are of childbearing  potential  must  have  a urine  or blood  pregnancy  test at SV1. 
8.3.7  Laboratory  tests 
The following  laboratory  values  will be collected  per the schedule of visits (Table 1) : 
▪ Serum  Creatinine  
▪ HbA1c  
▪ Blood  Glucose  
8.4 Peripheral  Perfusion  Assessment  
One of the following assessments will be completed to confirm sufficient tissue perfusion for 
trial participation.  
8.4.1  ABI or Arterial  Doppler  Ultrasound  
ABI, also known as the Winsor Index and the Ankle Brachial Pressure Index, is the ratio of 
blood pressure measured at the ankle to that measured at the arm. Details of the procedure 
can be found  in Appendix B.  An ABI < 0.8 indicates  that there  is a high probability  that arterial 
insufficiency is present (positive predictive value 95% in a general practice population).  
It should  be noted  that incompressible,  calcified  arteries  may occur  in diabetes  causing  a 
falsely elevated ABI, so if the subject has other signs or symptoms that could suggest 
peripheral arterial disease, further investigations to determine vascular status may be 
warranted.  8/6/202411:05:38PMEDTSubramanianGunasekaranEnCollCorp

Page 41 of 63  Confidential  A documented  record  of an ABI test performed  using  the target ulcer  leg, within  one month  of 
SV1 is acceptable for the purposes of this study, otherwise this must be completed in the 
Screening Period.  
As an alternative , arterial  Doppler  ultrasound  can be performed  evaluating  for biphasic  dorsalis 
pedis and posterior tibial vessels at the level of the ankle.  
ABI test to be included in week 1, 1.5 and 2 to monitor neo -vascularization . 
8.4.2  SPP 
SPP provides another noninvasive method for measuring microcirculatory pressure of the 
artery at the skin level. It measures the pressure at which perfusion first returns to the 
cutaneous microcirculation following a controlled release of occlusion. SPP is  useful in 
assessing  the ischemic  severity  of lower  limb and predicting ulcer  healing  in chronic  critical 
limb ischemia with  a value of <30  mmHg. See Appendix C for the appropriate technique of 
assessment.  
8.4.3  TCOM  
A TCOM assesses the partial pressure of oxygen molecules dissolved in the blood plasma. 
The amount of oxygen detected by the sensor is a balance of the oxygen delivery and local 
physiologic demands and reflects the metabolic status of the skin; it indicates the level of 
oxygen  available  at the ulcer  site to assist  in the ulcer healing  process.  A TCOM  less than 30 
mmHg of oxygen indicates impaired ulcer healing and ischemic disease. An appropriate 
technique for a TCOM assessment is provided in Appendix D.  
8.5 Pain  Assessment:  NPRS  
Pain intensity  of the reference  DFU is to be assessed  before  any dressing  changes  or other 
ulcer manipulations at all screening and treatment visits.  
The subject will be asked to indicate a numerical value that best represents the current pain 
intensity at the target ulcer site on a scale of 0 to 10, anchored by word descriptors at each 
end, as "no pain"  on the left side and "worst  possible  pain"  on the right side of the number line. 
The number 0 represents “no pain,” the number 5 represents “moderate pain”, and the  
number 10 represents the “worst possible pain.”  The subject indicates the level of pain 
intensity by selecting a number on the line shown in Figure 3 below that represents their 
perception of their current state.

Page 42 of 63  Confidential  8.6 Ulcer  Assessments  
A number  of different  target  ulcer  assessments  are required,  including  appearance,  exudate 
characteristics, infection, and peri -wound characteristics.  
8.6.1  Target  Ulcer  Appearance  Assessment  (Pre-debridement)  
Target  Ulcer  Appearance  Assessment  (pre-debridement)  categories  includes:  
▪ % Granulating  (red/brown  bumpy  tissue  that bleeds  upon  light debridement)  
▪ % Non-viable  tissue  
▪ % Epithelialized  Skin 
Note:  the categories  should  add to 100%.  
8.6.2  Target  Ulcer  Exudate  Assessments  
The Investigator will determine the amount and type, if any, of target ulcer exudate. In 
determining the amount of target ulcer exudate, the Investigator must take into account the 
amount of exudate absorbed into the target ulcer dressing.  Table 2 below details the 
categories  will be used  to quantify  the amount  and describe  the type of target ulcer  exudate:  
TABLE 2: TARGET ULCER EXUDATE ASSESSMENT  
 
Target  Ulcer  Exudate  Assessment  
 
 
Volume  • No exudate  
• Minimal  amount  
• Light  (scant)  or small  amount  
• Moderate  amount  
• Heavy/large/copious  amounts  
 
 
Type  • Not applicable:  no exudate  present  
• Serous:  clear  or light-yellow  watery  plasma  
• Serosanguinous:  pink to light-red watery  plasma  
• Sanguineous:  red with fresh  bleeding  
• Purulent:  thick and opaque  exudate,  of creamy  yellow,  green,  white, 
or tan color  
 
8.6.3  Target  Ulcer  Infection  Assessments  
The presence/absence of the following signs of infection at the target ulcer site will be 
documented  at each  visit. Infection  of the target  ulcer  will be assessed  using  the STONEES 
method  developed by  Woo and Sibbald.19 Table  3 below  lists the criteria for considering an 
target ulcer infected:

Infection  at Target  Ulcer  site prior  to Randomization   
If the infection  occurs  prior to randomization  i.e., prior to TV1, then the subject will be ineligible 
to be randomized . 
Infection  at Target  Ulcer  site after  Randomization   
If infection  of the target  ulcer  site occurs  after randomization  i.e., after Randomization visit  
record the infection as an adverse event and treat it as appropriate with oral antibiotics at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  
 
Note: application  of topical antibiotics  and anti-microbial  dressings  to the target  ulcer  site are 
prohibited.  
A subject with  an infected target ulcer  that is  being  treated  by the Investigator  will remain  in the 
study unless the situation requires an alternative methodology that violates the protocol.  
Antibiotic  interventions  will be recorded  on the Concomitant  Medications CRF, and  the event 
will be categorized  as an Adverse  Event,  serious  if it meets  the definition  of that category.  All 
subjects  who show  evidence  of an ulcer  infection  must  have  it reported  on an Adverse  Event  
CRF. 
All subjects  will be instructed  to contact  the Investigator  if signs  or symptoms  of infection 
develop prior to their next scheduled visit.  
During  an episode  of infection,  the Investigator  should  not continue  TCC,  if it is being  used, 
until the infection is resolved, and dressings should be changed at least every 72 hours.  
Evaluate  the skin surrounding  the target  ulcer  for presence  of signs  such  as erythema,  edema, 
and cellulitis.  
8.6.4  Investigator  Assessment  of Target  Ulcer  Closure  
“Complete  healing ” of the target  ulcer  is defined  as 100%  re-epithelialization  without  drainage.  
At each visit, the Investigator will assess the ulcer by answering the following questions:  
• Is target  ulcer  100%  re-epithelialized?  
• Is drainage  absent?  
Both questions  must  be answered  “yes”  for the target  ulcer  to be considering  having  reached 
“complete closure.”  
The date of complete  healing  is defined  as the date of the first assessment  of 100%  re- 
epithelialization.  
Target  Ulcer  Photographs  and Measurements  
The target  ulcer  will be digitally imaged  with a digital  camera  that is  at least 20  (twenty) 
megapixels, with the photo taken at a focal distance of  approximately  18 inches and a two -
dimensional calibration scale with two photos taken at a • New areas  of breakdown  or satellite  lesions  
• Presence  of swelling  or reddened  skin in peri-wound  area 
• Increased  wound  drainage  
• Unpleasant,  sweet,  or sickening  odor present  
NOTE: An ulcer that is deemed to be infected with three or more of the following 
signs  will undergo  a wound  culture  to confirm  the presence  of infection  and identify 
the pathogenic organism, so the study subject receives the most appropriate 
antibiotic treatment

will also take a ruler and measure length and width of the wound and record appropriately . 
The area will be calculated using a length by width calculation.  
8.7  Randomization   
Subjects  who are eligible  to participate  in the study  will be randomized to one treatment group 
at the time of completion of screening . 
8.8 Assessment  of Offloading  
The following  questions  will be asked  to assess  the performance  of the offloading  during  the 
Screening and Treatment Phase visits and at selected follow -up visits:  
• Did the subject have  the offloading  device  with him or her or is the TCC cast still present? 
(Yes/No)  
• What  percentage  of the time is the subject  using  the offloading  device  while  not sleeping? 
(Note: heel ulcers might still need to be offloaded while sleeping.)  
8.9 Semmes  Weinstein  Monofilament  Test for Peripheral  Neuropathy  
This is a non-invasive  topical  evaluation  of neuropathy  with a monofilament  wire to the foot 
with the target ulcer . The  test will be performed in a standard manner with 10 points being 
evaluated on each visit. At each point,  the Investigator  asks the  subject  whether  they can  feel 
the filament (yes or  no). Note:  If a subject  is missing  a body  part called  out in  the Semmes  
Weinstein  test, the most  skin in the area where the missing body part is located is used for 
the test.

9.2 Statistical  Analysis  
Descriptive  statistical  methods  will be used  to summarize  the data from this study  with no 
hypothesis testing performed for the endpoints.  
A formal  Statistical  Analysis  Plan (SAP)  will be created  prior to database  lock. The primary 
endpoint analysis will be at 5 weeks and a series of secondary and exploratory  endpoints  will 
be analyzed  at 5 weeks  (PAR  will be analyzed  at all  timepoints).  The SAP will provide  a more  
technical  and detailed  description  of the proposed  data analysis  methods  and procedures. Any 
deviation from the analyses outlined in the protocol will be described in the most current 
version of the SAP. All statistical analyses will be conducted using PASW 28.  
No power analysis was conducted as the numbers of subjects enrolled in this trial are too 
small.    
The populations  defined  for analysis  will include  the intent -to-treat (ITT)  and per protocol  (PP). 
Additional analysis populations may be defined to evaluate study results. Any additional 
analysis populations will be defined in the SAP.

10 ADVERSE  EFFECTS  AND  EVENTS  (DEFINITIONS  AND  REPORTING)  
The Investigator is  responsible  for the detection  and documentation  of any  events  meeting  the 
criteria  and definition  of an adverse  effect  or adverse  event  (AE),  as described  in this protocol. 
During the study when there is a safety evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be 
responsible  for detecting, documenting, and  reporting  any adverse  effect or  adverse  event, as 
detailed in this section of the protocol.  
10.1 SOC  Adverse  Events  
Since this a post market study involving commercially available SOC dressings of FDA 
cleared  and approved  medical  devices;  adverse  events  associated  with their use may also 
require reporting to FDA  along with the possible reason for the failure of the treatment 
which may include product handling and other details . 
An AE is defined  as any unfavorable  or unintended  sign,  symptom  or disease  that occurs  or is 
reported by the subject to have occurred, or  a worsening of a pre -existing condition related to 
the procedure  or medical  treatment  (device/drug)  used. All  AEs related  to the study  procedure 
or medical treatment, including intercurrent illnesses, must be recorded in the subject’s 
medical records and on the CRF. CTCAE v 5.0 will be used for AE reporting.  
AEs will be defined  as those  events  that occur  after the first study  treatment  is applied  at TV1, 
through the final study visit. A description of the AE along with the onset date, end date, 
severity, action taken, treatment, outcome, likely cause and relationship to the study 
procedure or products will be recorded in the CRF.  
AEs associated  with each  treatment  arm will be tabulated  and compared  at the end of the 
study. AEs will be elicited through direct questioning, subject reports, and physical 
examination.  
An abnormal  laboratory  test result  is not by itself considered  to be an AE unless  the Investigator 
considers the finding of clinical significance that should be reported in such a manner . 
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of the AE to the procedure or 
medical treatments used and the seriousness and expectedness of the AE at the time of 
occurrence.  A medically  qualified  person  appointed  by the Sponsor  will also assess  this once 
the Sponsor has been notified of an AE. For  enrolled  subjects, all AEs that occur during the 
trial will be documented on the AE CRF.  
AEs reported  during  the study  should  be followed  to resolution  of the AE or within  thirty  days 
from the end of the study. A final assessment of the outcome will be made at that time.  
Each AE related to the study procedure or medical treatment used will be categorized as 
“serious”  or “not serious,”  based  on the definition  of a serious  adverse  event  (SAE).  A SAE is 
defined as an AE resulting in at least one of the outcomes described in Section 10.1.3.  
10.1.1  AE Severity  Assessments  
The guidelines outlined in CTCAE v4.0 will be used for severity assessments. Note : the term 
“severe”  is a measure  of intensity  and that a severe  AE is not necessarily  serious.  Table  5 below 
provides guidance on determining the severity of an AE.  8/6/202411:05:38PMEDTSubramanianGunasekaranEnCollCorp

TABLE 5: AE SEVERITY GRADING SCALE  
 
Severity  Grade  Description  
Mild (1) Awareness  of sign,  symptom,  or event,  but easily  tolerated; 
does not interfere with usual daily activities or tasks.  
Moderate  (2) Discomfort  is enough  to cause  interference  with usual  daily 
activity. It may warrant therapeutic intervention.  
Severe  (3) Incapacitating:  inability  to perform  usual  activities  and daily 
tasks;  significantly  affects  clinical  status;  requires  therapeutic  
intervention.  
Life-threatening  (4) Emergency  treatment  required,  life-threatening,  death.  
A grade  of 1-4 is assigned  by the Investigator  to each  AE. 
10.1.2  AE Causality  Assessments  
AEs will be assigned a relationship (causality) to the study procedure or medical treatments. 
The Investigator will be responsible for determining the relationship between an AE and the 
study  procedure  or medical  treatment.  The type of event,  organ  system  affected  and timing  of 
onset of the event will be factors in assessing the likelihood that an AE  is related to the study 
procedure or medical treatment. The relationship of AEs to study procedures or medical 
treatments will be classified as follows:  
▪ Not Related : No relationship  exists  between  the AE and the study  procedure  or medical 
treatment. The event is attributed to a pre -existing medical condition or an inter -current 
event unrelated to the study procedure or medical treatments.  
▪ Possibly Related : Follows the study procedure or medical treatment but may have 
developed  as a result  of an underlying  clinical  condition  or treatments/interventions 
unrelated to the study.  
▪ Probably  Related : Follows  the study  procedure  or medical  treatment  but is unlikely  to have 
developed as a result of the subject’s underlying clinical condition or other treatment or 
other interventions.  
▪ Definitely Related : Follows the study procedure or medical treatment and physical 
evidence  shows  a convincing  relationship  to the study  procedure  or medical  treatment.  
▪ Unknown : Follows  the study  product  or medical  treatment,  but unable  to determine  the 
relationship to the study procedure or medical treatment.  
10.1.3  Serious  Adverse  Events  
A SAE is any untoward  medical  incident  that occurs  during  the course  of the study  beginning 
after informed consent has been executed.  
A SAE is defined  as any AE that: 
▪ Results  in death  
▪ Is life threatening  (the subject  is at immediate  risk of dying  from the adverse  experience)  
▪ Requires  subject  hospitalization  or prolongs  existing  hospitalization  
▪ Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
▪ Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  8/6/202411:05:38PMEDTSubramanianGunasekaranEnCollCorp

   Page 49 of 63   
Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization  may be considered  a SAE when,  based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment, 
they may jeopardize  the subject and  may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
10.1.3.1  Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events  
The Investigator or delegated site personnel is required to report all SAEs that occur during 
the study.  Once  the Investigator  or delegated  site personnel  becomes  aware  of a SAE, he/she 
must report the SAE to the Sponsor and copy the CRO within 24 hours .  
The study  sponsor  contact  is: Subra Guna , PhD 
Phone:   510-396-8581  
Email :  guna@encoll.com  
A written SAE report must follow and must include a full description of the event and all 
supporting documentation available at the time (e.g., lab reports, culture reports, etc.). 
Additional  follow -up information  as it becomes  available  must  be reported  to the CRO  and/or 
Sponsor.  
The Investigator or delegated site  personnel is also responsible  for reporting all SAEs to  the 
IRB in accordance with  IRB reporting guidelines,  local laws and regulations. The Investigator 
is responsible for maintaining  documentation  in the study  file that indicates  the IRB has been  
properly  notified.  
10.1.3.2  SAE Follow -up 
All SAEs  will be monitored  for a minimum  of 30 days  until they are resolved,  have  stabilized, 
or are clearly determined to be due to a subject’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness (es).

12 QUALITY  CONTROL  AND  QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
12.1 Acceptability  of CRF 
CRFs must be completed for each subject who has signed an ICF. For subjects who are 
screen  failures,  this would  be limited  to Screening  or other  applicable  forms. All  source 
documents and CRFs will be completed as soon as possible after the subject’s visit.  
12.2 Modification  of Protocol  
The Investigator will not modify or alter this protocol without first obtaining the concurrence of 
the Sponsor.  Approval  by the Investigator’s  IRB must  also be obtained  prior to implementation 
of the change, with two exceptions:  
▪ When  necessary  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  hazard  to the subject,  or 
▪ When  the modification  does  not involve  the subject’s  participation  in the trial. 
An amendment  may also require  modification  of the ICF.  The Investigator  will provide  an 
approval letter for the amendment and revised ICF, if applicable, to the Sponsor. An 
amendment must be made in writing, and it must be dated by both the Sponsor and the 
Investigator. All material must be approved by the IRB.  
12.3 Reporting  Protocol  Deviations  
The Investigator is obligated to follow the protocol without departure from the requirements 
written in the protocol. Any time there is deviation from any protocol requirements, a protocol 
deviation is required to be documented within the subject’s source documentation. If the 
deviation may impact subject participation, the Sponsor should be notified and will make the 
determinatio n as to whether the subject will continue in the study. The Sponsor also has the 
right to discontinue  the subject  for protocol  violations. The  IRB may also have  to be contacted 
if safety to the subject or if the scientific soundness of the study is involve d. All protocol 
deviations must be documented in the CRFs. Protocol deviations will be tracked at the site 
level and (by the Sponsor) at the study level for the duration of the trial.

13 ETHICS  AND  REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this protocol and in 
accordance  with principles consistent GCP, ICH  E6, HIPAA  regulations (45 CFR Part 164) 
and the Belmont Principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. No protocol 
changes will be implemented without prior review and approval of the IRB, except where it 
may be necessary  to eliminate  an immediate  hazard  to a study  subject.  In such  a case,  the 
change will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, according to IRB requiremen ts. 
Additionally,  all products  used  in this study  are manufactured,  handled,  and stored  in 
accordance with their FDA labeling.  
13.1 IRB 
The Investigator at each center will provide the IRB with study materials, including but not 
limited to the clinical study protocol, ICF and any advertising materials. The study will not be 
initiated until the IRB provides written approval of the aforementioned documents and until 
approval documents have been obtained by the Principal Investigator and Sponsor or  
Sponsor designee. The site Investigator will not participate in the decision. If the Investigator  
is an IRB member, documentation must be provided indicating recusal from the approval 
process. Appropriate reports on the progress of this study by the Investigator w ill be made to 
the IRB as required by local and applicable government regulations and in agreement with 
policy established by the Sponsor. The Investigator is required to maintain an accurate and 
complete  record  of all  written  correspondence  to and received  from the IRB and must  agree  to 
share all such documents and reports with the Sponsor.  
No changes  from the final approved  protocol  will be initiated  without  IRB prior written  approval 
or favorable opinion of a written amendment, except when necessary to eliminate immediate 
hazards to subjects or when the change involves only logistics or administration.  
13.2 Investigator’s  Responsibilities  
The Investigators  are responsible  for performing  the study  in full accordance  with the protocol 
and the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH GCP Consolidated Guideline 
and any applicable national and local laws and regulations. Information regarding any study 
centers participating in this study that cannot comply with the se standards will be 
documented.  
13.3 Subject  Informed  Consent  Requirements  
Written and oral information about the study in a language understandable by the patient will 
be given to all patients by the Investigator and/or designee. Written informed consent will be 
obtained from each patient before any procedures or assessments tha t would not otherwise 
be required for the care of the patient are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated 
benefits, potential hazards, and insurance arrangements in force are explained, and the 
patient has  been  given sufficient time  to ask questions and consider participation in the  study. 
It will also be explained  to the patients  that they are free to refuse  entry  into the study  and free 
to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment. It is permissible 
for a third person (e.g., a family member) to be present during the explanation of the study.  
The written ICF is to be in compliance with 21 CFR § 50.27 and GCP requirements.  The 
Sponsor  and/or  designated  CRO will  approve  the ICF and all amendments  to the ICF prior to 
submission to the IRB. A copy of the ICF to be used will be submitted by the Investigator to 
the IRB for review and approval prior to the start of the study. Each study site must provide  8/6/202411:05:38PMEDTSubramanianGunasekaranEnCollCorp

14 DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPING  
14.1 Recording  and Collection  of Data 
The primary  source  document  for this study  will be the subject's  medical  record.  If separate 
research records are maintained by Investigators, the medical record and the research 
records will be considered the source documents for the purposes of auditing the study.  
Applicable  source  data will be manually  transcribed  to the approved  CRF.  The Investigator  is 
ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the data transcribed on the forms. All source 
documents and CRFs will be completed as soon as possible after the subject's visit.  
The Investigator will review CRFs to indicate that, to his/her knowledge, they are complete 
and accurate.  If further  changes  are made  after this, the  Investigator  will need  to again  sign 
the Investigator  signature  page.  Designated  source  documents  will be signed  and dated by 
the appropriate study personnel. The Investigator must agree to complete and maintain 
source documents and CRFs for each subject participating in the study.  
All research  data will be entered,  either  electronically  or manually,  into a computerized 
database, designed in accordance with the clinical data manager.  
14.2 Clinical  Data  Management  and Monitoring  
The CRO will  be responsible  for the processing  and quality  control  of the data.  The study  will 
be monitored by the CRO. Monitoring may consist of either on site or remote review of any 
and all applicable study records. All study CRFs and background source documents will be 
made available for monitoring. The study monitor will ensure that the investigation is 
conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements.

submissions to regulatory authorities. It is the intent of the Sponsor and the Principal 
Investigator  to publish  or present  the study  results  together  with the other  sites unless  specific 
permission is obtained in advance from the Sponsor to publish separate results. Co - 
authorship with any of the Sponsor’s personnel will be discussed and mutually agreed upon 
submission of a manuscript for publication.  
All information concerning the Sponsor’s operations (such as patent applications, formulae, 
manufacturing processes, basic scientific data or formulation information supplied to the 
Investigator  and not previously  published)  is considered  confidential  by the Sponsor  and shall 
remain the sole property of the Sponsor. The Investigator agrees not to use it for other 
purposes without written consent.  
Publication and Disclosure: Because this is a multi -center study, sites and Investigators shall 
not independently publish, publicly disclose, present or discuss any results or information 
pertaining to site’s and Investigator’s activities conducted under this agreement, until such a 
multi -center publication is released under Sponsor’s direction; provided, however, tha t if a 
publication  is not released  within  eighteen  (18) months  after completion  of analysis of  all study 
data from all sites within the multi -center study, site and Investigator shall have the right to 
publish the results of and information pertaining to s ite’s and Investigator’s activities  
conducted under this protocol and the clinical trial agreement with sponsor permission.  Site 
and Investigator agree to submit any proposed manuscript, presentation, or other public 
disclosure  regarding  the study  to Sponsor  for review  at least  thirty  (30) days  prior to submitting 
such proposed manuscript to a publisher or delivering or making such presentation or other 
public disclosure to any third party. Within thirty (30) days of its receipt, Sponsor shall advise 
site a nd/or Investigator, as the case may be, in writing of any information contained therein 
that is confidential  information  (other  than research  results included  in a proposed  manuscript) 
or that may  impair Sponsor’s ability to obtain patent protection. Sponsor shall have the  right to 
require site and/or Investigator, as applicable, to remove specifically identified confidential 
information (but may not require removal of research results from a proposed manuscript .  
However, the Sponsor retains all the rights to use their own technical explanation to explain 
the research results which cannot be avoided by the Investigator ) and/or to delay the 
proposed submission or delivery of the proposed manuscript or presentation or other public 
disclosure,  for an additional sixty (60) days to enable Sponsor to seek patent protection.  Site 
and Investigator shall not publish, publicly disclose, present, or discuss any results of or 
information pertaining to sites and Investigator’s activities prior to completion of the trial, even 
if the study is terminated before its completion and the final clinical study report is signed off

Page 60 of 63  Appendix  B: ABI or Arterial  Doppler  Ultrasound 
ABI Technique  
Place  the subject in  the supine  position, with  the arms  and legs at the same  level as the heart, 
for a minimum of 10 minutes before measurement,  
Select  an appropriately  sized  blood  pressure  cuff for both the ankle  and the arms  (see figure 
below), the cuff width should be, at a minimum, 20% greater than the diameter of the 
extremity. The ankle cuff should be placed on the leg between the malleolus and the calf.  
Enough  room  should  be left below  both cuffs  to permit  placement of  the ultrasound  gel, so that 
the Doppler device can adequately detect the brachial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial 
arteries.  
Obtain  the brachial  systolic  pressures  of both  arms. Use  the higher  of the arm pressures  in the 
ABI calculation. Obtain the pressure in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries for the 
extremity with the target ulcer. Use the highest pressure for the ABI calculation.  
Ankle -Brachial  Index  = Highest  ankle  pressure/  Highest  brachial  pressure.  
Care should be taken to cover the index ulcer during the ABI measurement. In addition, 
subjects  should  be informed  that they may experience  discomfort during  the test, secondary  to 
the pressure exerted by the cuff in the area of skin breakdown.  
 
Arterial  Doppler  Ultrasound  Technique  
Place  the subject in  the supine  position, with  the arms  and legs at the same  level as the heart. 
Ultrasound gel will be applied at the ankle level to the anatomic position of the dorsalis pedis 
and posterior tibial vessels. The Doppler will then be applied to each vessel until a waveform 
is established, a printer will be used to document the Do ppler waveform and at least five 
waveforms will be printed for each vessel. The clinician will verify biphasic or triphasic 
waveform.

Appendix  C: SPP 
 
 
 
SPP can be employed  to evaluate  the subject’s  vascular  status. SPP  is obtained  using  a laser 
Doppler.  
 
Technique  
1. Secure the laser Doppler flow sensor within the bladder of a blood pressure cuff equipped 
with a transparent  polyvinyl  chloride  window  for measuring  microcirculatory  perfusion  during 
cuff inflation and deflation.  
2. Place  the subject  in supine  position  and keep  still for five minutes.  
3. Apply the  cuff to the proximal  margin  of the ulcer  and inflate  to 20 mmHg  above  the brachial 
systolic  pressure.  A stable  laser  Doppler  output  value  near zero (< 0.1 volume  %) should  be 
reached before deflating.  
4. Deflate the cuff, first in 10 mmHg -stepwise decrements every five seconds to a pressure of 
50 mmHg,  and then in 5-mmHg  decrements  every  15 seconds  until the laser  Doppler  output 
increased for two consecutive pressure values.  
5. The pressure  at which  this first occurred  is considered  the SPP value.  
Subjects  with SPP less than 30 mmHg  have  vascular  insufficiency  and are not candidates  for 
enrollment.

Page 62 of 63  Appendix  D: TCOM 
Technique  
Place the subject in the supine position, with the arms and legs at the same level as the heart. 
Electrodes must be in contact with the tissue through the contact liquid. If there is air between 
the tissue and an electrode, TCOM values will be questionable. Erroneous readings may also 
occur if electrodes are placed directly over a bone or there is sev ere edema around the wound. 
For the best results,  tests  should  be conducted  at ambient  temperature  (21-23⁰) and the subject 
should not have smoked, nor had caffeine for several hours prior.  
 
 
1. Calibrate  the TCOM  electrode —this takes  about  15-20 minutes.  
2. Clean  the selected  measuring  site with alcohol  or other  skin-preparation  solution.  
3. Dry the site well with a gauze  pad. 
4. Take  a standard  fixation  ring. 
5. Remove  the fixation  ring from the protective  film. 
6. Apply  the fixation  ring to the measuring  site as follows:  
• Press  the center  of the fixation  ring onto the measuring  site with a finger.  
• Run a finger  around  the rim circumference.  
• Press  firmly  to prevent  leaks.  
7. Fill the hole in the fixation  ring with 3-5 drops  of the contact  liquid.  
8. Affix the electrode  into the fixation  ring as follows:  
• Align  the arrow  on the electrode  with one of the marks  on the fixation  ring. 
• Turn the electrode  90° clockwise  to fasten  it in the fixation  ring. 
9. Repeat steps  1 to 8 if more  electrodes  are to be applied; note:  several  electrodes  can be 
calibrated at the same time.  
It is sometimes  advantageous  to simultaneously  use several  electrodes  placed  strategically 
around the wound and calculate mean values from individual readings.  
The normal sequence of events for TCOM is measurement in air, the leg elevation test 
(optional)  and the oxygen  challenge. Shah  et al20 determined  that the optimal  times  for these 
events in terms of measurement time are 20, 5 and 10 minutes, respectively.

Page 63 of 63  Appendix  E: Debridement  
Many chronic wounds contain necrotic tissue that has a black or dark gray appearance. Wound 
eschar is usually full -thickness, dry devitalized tissue arising from prolonged ischemia and 
slough  is an adherent  fibrous  material  commonly  creamy  yellow  in appearance.  Chronic  wounds 
can also have colonized bacteria in the form of biofilm or cells, particularly along the margins of 
a wound, which have stopped dividing - a process known as senescence. Finally, devitalized 
tissue and biofilms can harbor high levels o f cytokines or cellular remnants that maintain the 
wound in the inflammatory or proliferative stages of healing, through cellular trafficking 
processes.  Any of these factors can disrupt the normal stages of wound healing.  
Debridement  is the process  by which  these  elements  are removed  to permit  healing,  in effect 
changing the stalled chronic wound into an acute wound. In this clinical study, we have 
restricted the type of debridement to sharp debridement.  
 
Technique  
Sharp  debridement  comprises  the following  elements:  
1. The target  ulcer  and the surrounding  skin are prepped  with water or  Saline.  
2. Anesthesia,  topical  or injected,  is applied  to the ulcer  as necessary  to reduce  subject 
discomfort.  
3. Using  a sterile  technique,  all non-viable  tissue  in the wound  bed is excised  using  a scalpel 
and scissors.  
4. Excessive  bleeding  is controlled  by using  direct pressure,  but cautery  may be employed  if 
necessary.  
If extensive  surgical  debridement  is necessary  during  the run-in period  (e.g.,  general  anesthesia 
is required), the patient is not a candidate for this trial. Likewise, if other forms of debridement 
(e.g., enzymatic) are required during run -in, based on the opinion of the treating clinician, the 
subject should be screen failed. During the Tr eatment Phase of the trial, other forms of 
debridement  are NOT  permitted.  If this should  happen,  the type of debridement  should  be noted 
in the CRF, using other forms of debridement besides sharp debridement more than once 
during the treatme nt phase will result in the subject being withdrawn from the trial.  
Although  there  is increasing  evidence  that more  frequent  debridement  results  in faster  healing 
on average, the frequency and level of debridement in this trial is left up to the treating 
physician’s judgment. Excessive debridement can be as deleterious to healing as too little 
debridement.  
For wound bed preparation, follow the TIME principles: Tissue management (primarily 
debridement  in this trial),  control  of Infection  and Inflammation  (management  of infection,  control 
of edema, management of exudate, etc.), Moisture imbalance (ensuring that the wound is at all 
times in a moist healing environment, as well as dealing with excessive wound exudate), and 
advancement of the epithelial Edge of the wound (addressing hy poxia, infection, desiccation, 
dressing trauma, hyperkeratosis and calluses, and cell senescence at the wound margin).

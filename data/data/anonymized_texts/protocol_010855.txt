ABSTRACT  
Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intra -ocular malignancy in childhood. Two-thirds of children 
diagnosed with retinoblastoma  have disease in one eye only (unilateral disease). About 85% of the children 
with unilateral retinoblastoma have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and the standard of care in 
these children is enucleation of the eye . Although this procedure is curative in over 90% of children , there 
is a desire among many families to preserve the eye. Furthermore , some  of these eyes have useful vision 
that is lost with enucleation.  
 Systemic chemotherapy in combination with local ophthalmic therapy  has been used with the goal of 
avoiding enucleation. Studies have shown that chemoreduction and l ocal therapy do not provide effective 
control in patients w ith advanced unilateral disease and  a high proportion of these patients eventually 
require either external beam radiation therapy or enuc leation.  
 Localized  delivery of chemotherapy directly into the ophthalmic artery may increase ocular salvage and 
result in less toxicity than systemic chemotherapy. However, this complex technique requires a high level 
of expertise that is currently avail able only at large pediatric centers with excellent infrastructure . Several  
institutions within the United States and in other countries are currently  using this modality. A s more 
centers engage  in this treatment toxicities are being reported, including acute vitreous hemorrhage, 
chorioretinal atrophy, and ophthalmic artery stenosis. A properly designed prospective study to evaluate 
the feasibility and efficacy of this procedure in the context of  a multi -institutional study  is a critical next 
step towards the goal of establish ing guidelines for the safe implementation of the intra- arterial technique 
across COG sites.  
 
ARET12P1 is designed to test the feasibility of delivering melphalan directly into the ophthalmic artery in 
children with newly diagnosed unilateral retinoblastoma with G roup D disease , by the International 
Classification System for Intraocular Retinoblastoma,  who would otherwise be considered for enucleation. 
Response to therapy and  toxicity of the regimens will also be assessed.  This study will be the first attempt 
to perform a well -conducted clinical trial  of intra-arterial  therapy for unilateral retinoblastoma  with 
emphasis on feasibility and efficacy in a multi -institutional tria l.

enucleated for progression.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Retinoblasto ma is the most common primary intra- ocular malignancy in childhood. Two-
thirds of children diagnosed with retinoblastoma  have disease in one eye only (unilateral 
disease). About 85% of the children with unilateral retinoblastoma have advanced disease 
at the time of diagnosis and the standard of care in these children is enucleation of the eye . 
Although this procedure is curative in over 90% of children , there is a desire among many 
families to preserve the eye. Furthermore, some  of these eyes have useful vi sion that is lost 
with enucleation.  
 
Systemic chemotherapy in combination with one or more of other therapies such as 
cryotherapy and laser therapy have been used  as alternative treatments for the prevention 
of metastatic disease and local recurrence and preservation of vision. E xternal beam 
radiation or radioactive plaque therapy  have also been used for effective orbital and 
intraocular disease control.  Shields et al. have shown that chemoreduction alone in patients 
with advanced unilateral disease does n ot provide effective control of disease; in their study 
all such patients eventually required either external beam radiation therapy or enucleation.1 
Furthermore ocular oncologists strongly feel that to treat a patient with intraocular tumor (s) 
with systemic chemotherapy of several months duration with subsequent toxicities is not 
optimal.  
 
In countries like Japan where there is particular emphasis by the families to preserve the 
globe, attempts were made by investigators to inject chemotherapy directly into the internal 
carotid artery with an inflated balloon above the origi n of the ophthalmic artery.2 The aim 
was to facilitate chemotherapy to enter the ophthalmic artery. The drug they chose f or intra -
arterial chemotherapy was melphalan based on in vitro studies.3 Using this technique 
Suzuki and Kaneko reported 563 injection s in 187 patients with a low rate of complications. 
All of the eyes treated also received concomitant therapy with either hyperthermia, external beam radiation and/or, in 1 patient, intravitreal injection s of melphalan. Investigators in the 
US have further developed the technique by performing selective cannulation of the

ophthalmic artery to deliver chemotherapy.4-7 In the most recent update, 95 eyes in 78 
patients (30 unilateral, 48 bilateral) were treated with intra -arterial chemotherapy.7 The 
mean number of procedures was 3.2 per patient and 3.1 per eye. Chemotherapy included 
melphalan alone , or in combination with topotecan, and/or carboplatin. The ocular salvage 
rate was 81.7% for the 39 previously untreated eyes and 58.4% for the 56 R- E V eyes that 
had failed prior treatments. Catheterization was successful in 98.5% of patients. The ocular 
salvage rate was 81.7% for the 39 previously untreated eyes and 58.4% for the 56 R -E V 
eyes that had failed prior treatments. Catheterization was successful in 98.5% of patients. Neutropenia developed after 29 of 255 IA sessions (11.4%) and of these only 8 were grade 
4; only one child required admission for fever and neutropenia. No child required blood 
products. All the children are alive including 2 who developed metastases, 7 and 9 months after enucleation.  
 
Impressive as these results are, the heterogeneity of treatments administered as well as the 
lack of a proper study design to as sess toxicity and outcomes in a prospective manner leave 
many questions unanswered. However several centers in the United States have started performing this procedure. Using this complex technique requires a high level of expertise 
that is only available at large pediatric centers with excellent infrastructure. Furthermore, 
as more centers are engaging in this treatment ocular toxicities are being reported, 
including acute vitreous hemorrhage, chorioretinal atrophy, and ophthalmic artery 
stenosis.
8,9,10 
 Therefore, a properly designed prospective study is felt to be critical. The COG Rare Tumors committee sponsored a meeting of ophthalmologists, interventional radiologists 
and pediatric oncologists from 10 large pediatric centers to design a study that could 
eventually establish guidelines for the safe implementation of the intra- arterial technique 
and to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy in the context of a multi- institutional study. It 
was agre ed that patients with Group D disease, by the International Classification System 
for Intraocular Retinoblastoma, would be the appropriate treatment population and to avoid 
Group E eyes because of the possible increased incidence of high- risk factors for m etastasis 
in these advanced tumors.
11,12 On this study, t here will be a rapid central review of 
RETCAM images at the time of enrollment and at the end of the 3rd cycle. Central review 
has worked very well within COG in the past. Of the 7 patients excluded from the study 
ARET0331 which was opened for patients with Group B disease, 6 had either Group C or 
D disease and therefore would have been significantly under -treated if they were enrolled 
on ARET0331.  
 
Melphalan is an ideal drug for this technique. It does not need to be metabolized to an 
active agent and the half life of melphalan oral formulation is 90 minutes vs.75 
minutes for the intravenous formulation . It is rapidly excreted mainly through the non-
renal route. The dose used for intra- arterial injection s for retinoblastoma is low and its 
efficacy in this setting has been proven by the above studies. In the largest and most recent 
report on IA therapy in children with retinoblastoma an initial dose finding phase was 
described where efficacy and toxicity were assessed during examination under anesthesia every 3 -4 weeks after treatment.
7 The recommended doses of melphalan from this study 
were 3 mg for patients between 6 and 12 months of age, 4 mg between the ages of 12 months and 24 months and 5 mg between 24 months and 36 months. Initial drug dosage 
was based on age which provides an estimate of the ocular size.
13,14 However upon further 
review of the literature addressing growth in globe volume, we feel that consistent and uniform dosing across the ages will be obtained with 3 mg (6 to 11.99 months), 3.5 mg

2.2 Central Reviews for Eligibility, Assessment of Responses and IA Technique  
Through previous COG protocols a central review mechanism was set up to review 
eligibility based on initial stage. In this study this mechanism will be used not only to 
confirm eligibility but also response at the end of the 3rd cycle. Three ophthalmologists 
with one alternate will be on the review panel to assess eligibility and three interventional 
radiologists with one alternate will review interventional radiology recordings of the  first 
IA injection  on every patient. The purpose of these reviews is to assess the technique of 
the individual interventional radiologist and the anatomy of the vasculature involving the ophthalmic artery. The reviewers may suggest a dose modification after studying the 
vasculature of the ophthalmic artery .  
 
Several institutions within the United States and institutions in other countries (Italy, 
Switzerland, and Argentina) are using this modality. However this proposal will be the first attempt to perform a well -conducted clinical trial with emphasis on feasibility and 
efficacy i n a multi- institutional trial.  
 
There is an urgent need for the development of a prospective multi -institutional trial to test 
the feasibility of the technique in a cooperative group setting which may serve as a prelude to future studies with agents other than melphalan and more importantly help refine the 
delivery technique so the local toxicities can be minimized.
15-17 
 
2.3 Assessment of Vision  
Historically and in a number of treating centers advanced unilateral retinoblastoma (Groups D/E) is managed with primary enucleation. As such any salvaged eye would have an 
improved visual acuity over controls.  
 
Objective testing of vision in pre -verbal children at baseline is possible with methods such 
as Teller visual acuity. This approach requires a specialty trained technician monitoring the response of a cooperative child, as various striped cards are presented to the infant. Given 
the need to patch the normal eye in a newly diagnosed infant with unilateral disease  many 
children will not be cooperative for this test and the measured acuity may be compromised. In some centers Teller vision assessment is not readily avail able and the quality of the 
technical support may vary. Requiring such a visual assessment at baseline may exclude some centers from participation or delay therapy from being initiated. Also the quality of data across institutions using this technique may render the results inconclusive.  
 Prior reports addressing vision in this cohort have looked at final visual acuity not the 
variance of vision from study entry to exit. In most cases the affected eye will present and 
remain amblyopic. The average age at study entrance will be 22- 23 months but this will 
range on average from 6 months to 4 years. On this study, we will be  assessing visual acuity  
once a year for 4 years, starting 1  year after completion of protocol therapy ; most children  
should be between 3-5 years of age.  
 Options for testing visual acuity in the 3- 5 year age range include: Snellen letters, Snellen 
numbers, Tumbling E, HOTV, and Allen figures. Each test is listed in decreasing order of 
cognitive difficulty. Given these criteria and age range we will be using the single surround 
HOTV – known as the amblyopia treatment study visual acuity protocol. The approach has 
been validated and has a high testability in 3 -7 year olds. It is standardized and has been 
used in multi -center trials for amblyopi a treatment.

We have consulted Dr M Repka a pediatric ophthalmologist with expertise in this field 
who has recommended the above testing method. 
 
2.4 Histopathology of Eyes Enucleated for P rogression 
Eyes enucleated for progression will be processed and sent for central histopathology 
review by Dr Patricia Chevez- Barrios who is a leading expert in the pathology of 
Retinoblastoma. This will be the first prospective study of systematic assessment of histopathology features of eyes that are enucleated for pr ogression following IA therapy.  
 A previous retrospective study of 8 eyes treated with intra -arterial chemotherapy for 
retinoblastoma ha s shown ocular complications that include thromboembolic events. In 
this study the eyes were enucleated for tumor viabi lity, neovascular glaucoma, anaphylactic 
reaction from IAC, and persistent retinal detachment with poor vi sualization of the tumor .
18 
The tumor response  ranged  from minimal (n=1) to moderate (n=1) to extensive (n=4) to 
complete regression (n=2). Viable vitreous seeds (n=4 eyes), invasion into the optic nerve 
(n=3), reaching the lamina cribrosa in 2 cases, and invasion into the choroid (n=1) were 
observed. Histopathologic evidence of ischemic atrophy involving the outer retina and 
choroid was found in 4 eyes. One eye had extensive choroidal and outer retinal atrophy. 
This case showed orbital vascular occlusion and subendothelial smooth muscle 
hyperplasia. Intravascular birefringent foreign mater ial was observed in 5 cases within 
occluded vessels, stimulating a granulomatous inflammatory response. The foreign material comprised cellulose fibers (n=3), synthetic fabric fibers (n=1), or unknown 
composition (n=2). Thrombosed blood vessels were identi fied in 5 eyes and involved 
ciliary arteries in the retrobulbar orbit (n=5), scleral emissarial canals (n=1), small 
choroidal vessels (n=1), and central retinal artery (n=1 ).

institution is strongly encouraged to visit Dr . Pierre Gobin to observe 
the technique prior to enrolling patients on the protocol. 
 
4.1.4 Interventional Radiology Recording 
Interventional radiology recordings of the first IA melphalan injection  must  be 
taken during the procedure and sent to IROC Rhode Island (QARC)  for central 
review w ithin 14 days  of the procedure . If this recording is not submitted within 
the 14 day window, the subject will remain on study for feasibility, but will be considered inevaluable for response and salvage.  
 
4.1.5 EUA 
An examination under anesthesia (EUA) must be performed at the following time  
points: 
1. Up to 14 days prior to enrollment (diagnostic EUA). EUA does not 
have to be repeated prior to the first IA injection.

3. 14-28 days  after  the final IA injection . 
4. As clinically indicated . 
 
Patients with  evidence of  disease progression  (see Section 10.3 for definitions)  at 
the time of  EUA will be removed from protocol therapy  at specified time points . 
RETCAM images and retinal drawings  of the  two (2) most recent  EUAs should 
be sent for central review within 7  days of the EUA showing disease progression . 
 
4.1.6 Local Control Therapy  Guidelines 
Local control (cryotherapy, laser therapy, or plaque therapy ) will be performed as 
needed per ophthalmologist’s discretion at the time of EUA . See Section 15.0  and

4.1.8 Instructions for intra -arterial injection  of melphalan  
The injection must be completed  within 60 minutes of product reconstitution.  
 
Cerebral angiography in infants poses unique technical challenge, with potential risk of severe morbidity to both access and target vessels, as well as risk of possible severe 
neurological morbidity, arising quickly.  
 
Fastidious technique to reduce patient radiation exposure is particularly critical when 
treating infants with retinoblastoma, as the infant brain typically absorbs 50% of the incident skin radiation dose. Digital subtraction angiography exposes patients to a 
much higher radiation dose than do es live fluoroscopy. As such, formal angiographic 
runs should be minimized as much as possible, to a degree that is still consistent with safely performing the procedure and ensuring normal runoff to the brain and eye in 
all arterial branches. Roadmaps and live fluoroscopy are to be generally preferred.  
 For a unilateral treatment, a total skin dose of under 100 mGy (frontal and lateral planes summed) can be expected .  
 The procedure is performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  
 
Oxym etazoline 0.05% (two sprays) is sprayed in the nostril on the treatment side, to 
reduce the blush from the nasal mucosa and risk of epistaxis.  
 
Phenylephrine hydrochloride 10%  ophthalmic solution  (two drops) may be spread over 
the skin of the forehead above the eye on the treatment side, to vasoconstrict the skin and reduce the risk of skin erythema. (optional) 
 
Heparin is administered intravenously at 70 International Units/Kg.  
 
Heparin is administered after femoral artery puncture at the time of microcatheter 
manipulation inside the arteries  
 
One femoral artery (alternatively right/left) is punctured with a 3F micropuncture system 
and a 3F femoral sheath is placed.  
 
A straight microcatheter such as a Marathon (EV3 Irvine, CA) or a Magic 1.5 (Balt , 
Montmorency, France) is advanced over a micro -guide wire such as the Mirage (EV3 
Irvine, CA) int o the internal carotid artery. A 4F guide catheter is usually not necessary. 
A cerebral angiogram is performed.  
 
The microcatheter is placed at the origin of  the ophthalmic artery, without catheterizing 
it. Then, imaging of the ophthalmic artery is performed to visualize the angioanatomy, the choroid blush, and that there is no reflux of contrast into the internal carotid. To minimize 
radiation exposure, this last imaging is performed by subtracted fluoroscopy rather than 
angiography.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 21 
If the ophthalmic artery is not appropriate for selective catheterization, one may 
catheterize the middle meningeal artery and perform a selective angiogram to find if the 
orbital branch is large enough for catheterization and intra- arterial injection .  
 
The chemotherapy drug should be prepared according to Section 6.1  prior to delivery of 
the medication to the angio suite under sterile conditions. The drug is then injected manually by repeated small bolus –pulsatile injection - at a rate of 1 mL/minute.  
 
After completion of administration of the drug flush the catheter while still in place with 
0.5 ml normal saline.  
 All of the drug is expected to reach the ophthalmic artery.  
Operators should perform intermittent contrast or fluoroscopy to ensure that the catheter 
has not moved, or that spasm has not occurred. 
 
After dr ug delivery, another substracted fluoroscopy of the ophthalmic artery is 
performed; the microcatheter is pulled into the internal carotid artery and another internal carotid angiogram performed.  
 The microcatheter is removed, an ACT is performed and if <  2.5 baseline the sheath is 
removed and hemostasis of the femoral artery obtained with manual compression for 10-
20 minutes.  
 
After awakening, the child should be monitored for at least 6 hours post procedure before 
being discharged home for observation.

5.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITIES  
5.1 Dose of melphalan can be increased by 0.5 mg in case of large extraorbital branches 
of the ophthalmic artery (meningeal, ethmoid arteries) for the second and third cycle  
not to exceed the maximum al lowed dose in  Section 5.1.1. This increase in dose will 
be based on central review of the interventional radiology recording of the first 
injection . This central review will be performed within 14 days of receiving the data 
from the institution.  
 
5.1.1 Age based minimum and maximum allowed doses:  
= 6 - 11.99 month: 2.5 - 3.5 mg 
= 12 - 23.99 months: 3.0 - 4.0 mg 
≥ 24 months: 3.5 - 4.5 mg  
 
5.2 The standard dose should be decreased by 0.5  mg if there are signs of poor tolerance 
of previous intra -arterial treatment , not to fall below the minimum allowed dose in 
Section  5.1.1. This includes any Grade 4 inflammation of the eyelids and conjunctiva 
(see grading scale below.)  
 
5.2.1 Grading scale for  inflammation of the eyelids and conjunctiva:  
 Grade 1. Mild erythema of eyelids, orbit or forehead  
 Grade 2. Erythema and swelling over eyelids, orbit or forehead  
 Grade 3. Pain in the eye or orbit with erythema and/or swelling  
 Grade 4. Swelling and/or pain lasting more than 7 days  
 
Patients who develop post -injection c entral artery occlusion that does not recanalize prior to the 
subsequent injection  will be taken off protocol therapy.

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
See the consent document for toxicities.  
6.1 MELPHALAN   - INTRA- ARTERIAL       (08/28/13)  
(L-phenylalanine mustard, phenylalanine mustard, L- PAM, L -sarcolysin,  Alkeran®) NSC #008806  
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Melphalan, a phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard, is a bifunctional alkylating agent. Melphalan 
forms covalent cross- links with DNA or DNA protein complexes thereby resulting in cytotoxic, mutagenic, 
and carcinogenic effects. The end result of the alkylation process results in the misreading of the DNA code 
and the inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in rapidly proliferat ing tumor cells.  It is cell cycle 
non-specific. After IV administration, melphalan  plasma concentrations decline rapidly in a bi -exponential 
manner with distribution phase and terminal elimination phase half -lives of approximately 10 and 
75 minutes, respectively. Plasma m elphalan levels are highly variable after oral dosing, both with respect 
to the time of the first appearance of m elphalan  in plasma (range approximately 0 to 6  hours) and to the 
peak plasma concentration achieved. These results may be due t o incomplete intestinal absorption, a 
variable "first pass" hepatic metabolism, or to rapid hydrolysis. The oral dose averages 61% ± 26% of that following IV administration. The terminal elimination plasma half -life of oral melphalan is 
1.5 ± 0.83 hours. T he steady -state volume of distribution of m elphalan is 0.5  L/kg. The extent of m elphalan  
binding to plasma proteins ranges from 60-90%. Melphalan  is eliminated  from plasma primarily by 
chemical hydrolysis to monohydroxymelphalan and dihydroxymelphalan. The  24-hour urinary excretion 
of parent drug is approximately 10% suggesting that renal clearance is not a major route of elimination of parent drug. Penetration into CSF is low. Despite the fact that the contribution of renal elimination to 
melphalan clearance appears to be low, one pharmacokinetic study suggests dosage may need to be reduced 
in patients with renal impairment.  
 
Toxicity:  
Only limited data exist on the toxicity of intra -arterial melphalan. The anticipated toxicities for intra -arterial 
melphalan are listed in the first table. Toxicities of intravenous melphalan are provided in the second table 
for completeness. It is not known if these toxicities will occur in a patient receiving intra -arterial melphalan 
for retinoblastoma.

Melphalan was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats following oral (6 to 
18 mg/m2/day for 10 days) and intraperitoneal (18 mg/m2) administration. 
Malformations resulting from  melphalan included alterations of the brain 
(underdevelopment, deformation, mening ocele,  and encephalocele) and eye 
(anophthalmia and microphthalmos), reduction of the mandible and tail, as well 
as hepatocele (exomphaly). It is unknown whether the drug is  excreted in breast 
milk.  
 
Formulation and Stability:   
Melphalan for Injection is supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, freeze -dried powder. Each single -use vial 
contains melphalan  hydrochloride equivalent to 50 mg melphalan and 20 mg povidone. Melphalan for 
Injection is reconstituted using the sterile diluent provided. Each vial of ster ile diluent contains sodium 
citrate 0.2 g, propylene glycol 6.0 mL, ethanol (96%) 0.52 mL, and SWFI to a total of 10 mL. Store at 
controlled room temperature 15°-30°C (59°-86°F) and protect from light.  
 
Intra -arterial P reparation : 
• Using appropriate aseptic technique, r econstitute to a concentration of 5  mg/mL by rapidly 
injecting 10  mL of the supplied diluent directly into the vial of lyophilized powder using a sterile 
needle (20- gauge or larger needle diameter) and syringe. Immediately shake vial vi gorously until 
a clear solution is obtained. Rapid addition of the diluent followed by immediate vigorous shaking is important for proper dissolution.  
• Immediately dilute the dose to be administered in up to 20 mL of NS; the final volume of the 
product should be 20 mL. The concentration of the final drug product should be ≤ 0.45 mg/mL .  
• The final drug product should be filtered (e.g., with a 0.22 micron filter) prior to being dispensed.  
• A precipitate forms if the reco nstituted solution is stored at 5°C. Do not refrigerate the reconstituted 
product.

(The time between reconstitution/dilution and administration of melphalan should be kept to a minimum 
because reconstituted and diluted solutions of melphalan are unstable. Over as short a time as 
30 minutes, a citrate derivative of m elphalan has been detected in reconstituted material from the 
reaction of melphalan with the sterile diluent for melphalan. Upon further dilution with saline, nearly 1% label strength of m elphalan hydrolyzes every 10  minutes.)   
 
Guidelines for Administration:  See Treatment  (Section 4.0)  and Dose Modifications
 (Section 5.0)  sections 
of the protocol.  
 
Patients should receive oxymetazoline 0.05% ( e.g., Afrin) two puffs into the nares on the side of the 
procedure—prior to the procedure to reduce blushing.  
 
The drug is then injected manually by repeated small bolus –pulsatile injection - at a rate of 1 mL/minute . 
The injection must be completed within 60 minutes of product reconstitution.  
 
Supplier:  Commercially available. See package insert for further information.

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Sample Size and Duration  
A survey of potential enrollment at the 11 primary institutions participating in this trial indicates 
we can expect  at least  24 patients per year will be enrolled with disease characteristics and organ 
function that meet the eligibility criteria for the protocol.  Thirty -one (31) eligible and feasibility -
evaluable patients will be required in order to apply the statistical rules described below. 
Accounting for the possibility that 10% of patients will be either inevaluable or ineligible, we will 
enroll up to 34 patie nts. At the time of the amendment of the study design, 10 patients were enrolled; 
none were identified as inevaluable for the primary endpoint according to the definition in the 
amended protocol. We estimate enrollment can be concluded within 18 months of implementation 
of the modified design. Twelve months of accrual will be required and up to six months will be 
required to determine the feasibility status of all patients of patients enrolled in the first stage of the 
Study Design . 
 
9.2 Study Design  
The primary goal of this trial is to determine the feasibility of delivering melphalan directly into the ophthalmic artery.  
 
Feasibility Outcome: Intra -arterial (IA) feasibility will be assessed over the 3 injection s into the 
ophthalmic artery. A patient will be considered to have experienced IA therapy feasibility failure 
if: a) the intervention al radiologist is not able to access the ophthalmic artery for chemotherapy 
administrations during the first three cycles of therapy; b) patient develops central r etinal artery 
occlusion after the first or second cycle that does  not reopen by the  time the next injection is due; 
or c) the patient cannot receive all three treatments with IA therapy because of CTC AE 
complications Grade III or IV that are considered possibly, probably or likely related treatment.   
 
Evaluability for Feasibility Outcome: Any patient who does not experience IA feasibility failure 
event and is removed from protocol therapy prior to the third IA injection because: (1) the physician 
stops pr otocol therapy in the best interests of the patient; (2) the parent or guardian refuses further 
therapy; (3) disease is found in the contralateral eye; or (4) the patient does not qualify because repeat eligibility studies are outside enrollment requirements will be considered inevaluable for the 
primary outcome measure and replaced for evaluation of the primary goal . All other patients will 
be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. Each patient will require , at most , 4 months to 
complete the feasib ility evaluation. Any feasibility evaluable patient who does not experience 
feasibility failure will be considered a feasibility success.  
 
Design for the Primary Outcome Measure: Feasibility will be eval uated using a two- stage design.  
 Cumulative Number of 
Feasibility Successes  Decision  
Stage 1: Enter 12 feasibility 
evaluable patients  8 or fewer Terminate the trial because the 
therapy is considered not feasible 
to deliver.  
 9 or more  Proceed to Stage 2.  
Stage 2: Enter 19 additional 
feasibility evaluable 
patients  25 or fewer  Terminate the trial with the 
conclusion the therapy is 
considered not feasible to deliver.  
 26 or more Terminate the trial because the 
therapy is considered feasible to 
deliver.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 33 
 
 
If the true feasibility failure rate is 28%, the regimen will be identified as not feasible to  deliver with 
probability 91%. If the true feasibility failure rate is 10%, the regimen will be identified as feasible to 
deliver with probability 90%. 
 
Assessment of Ocular Salvage Ocular Salvage: Ocular salvage will be assessed over the 2 years following start of protocol therapy. A 
patient will be considered an ocular -salvage success if enucleation because of disease progression or 
toxicity is not required during the 2 years following enrollment onto ARE T12P1. Any patient who is lost 
to follow -up or for whom follow -up is terminated electively prior to 2 years by patient or parent preference 
will be considered inevaluable for the ocular salvage endpoint.  
 
The primary analyti c endpoint of this trial will be feasibil ity of delivery of IA therapy. The accrual target 
for this study will not be adjusted for the number of patients considered not evaluable for the ocular salvage endpoint. 
Design for Ocular Salvage Assessment: Interi m assessment of this aim will not be done since the salvage 
endpoint could require 2 years of follow-up after enrollment to ascertain. The probability of ocular salvage will be assessed after 31 feasibility -evaluab le patients have been enrolled.  
If 11 or fewer patients have ocular salvage (observed salvage rate 32%), we will consider the therapy to 
have an insufficient ocular salvage probability; otherwise, the data will be considered of sufficient inte rest Probability of Acceptance

with respect to ocular salvage for further inv estigation.  If the true probability of ocular salvage is 0.  50, the 
therapy will be considered of sufficient interest for further study with probability 9 3%. If the true probability 
of ocular salvage is 0.25, the therapy will be considered not of sufficien t interest for furth er study with 
probability 94%. If, at any time, 21 or more patients experience ocular salvage failure, enrollment will be 
suspended with the conclusion the therapy does not have a sufficient salvage r ate for further consideration.  
If fewer  or greater  than 31 patients are evaluable for the ocular salvage endpoint, the cutoff for the number 
of patients who have ocular salvage success will be adjusted to preserve the probability of identifying the 
therapy as not of sufficient interest for further examination to be at least 90% when the true probability  of 
ocular salvage is only 25%. Examples of such adjustments are provided in the following table.

Assessment of the Need for Systemic Chemotherapy  
 
Systemic Chemotherapy Administration: The need to administer systemic chemotherapy because of 
progressive disease in the eye considered for IA melphalan feasibility will be assessed over the 2 years 
following start of protocol therapy. A patient will be considered as  requiring systemic chemoth erapy if 
systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy of any kind is required because of disease progression in the affected eye 
at any time during the 2 years following enrollment onto ARET12P1. Any patient who is lost to follow- up 
or for whom follow -up is terminated electively prior to 2 years by patient or parent preference will be 
considered inevaluable for the evaluation of the need for systemic chemotherapy to control progressive 
disease in the affected eye.  
Design for Assessing the Need for Systemic Chemotherapy: Interim assessment of this aim will not be done 
since the salvage endpoint could require 2 years of follow- up after enrollment to ascertain.  
The probability of the need for systemic chemotherapy will be assessed after 31 systemic chemotherapy -
evaluab le pa tients have been enrolled.  If all 31 such patients are evaluable for ocular salvage, the foll owing 
design will be employed. If 19 or more patients require systemic chemotherapy (observed frequency 61% ), 
we will consider the therapy to have an insufficient freedom from systemic chemotherapy probability; 
otherwise, the data will be considered of sufficient interest with respect to freedom from systemic chemotherapy for further investigation. If the true probability of freedom from chemotherapy is 0.50, the 
therapy will be considered of sufficient interest with respect to this endpoint  with probability 9 3%. If the 
true probability of the need for systemic chemotherapy is 0.75, the therapy will be considered not of sufficient interest for this endpoint with probability 94%. If, at any time, 19 require chemotherapy to control 
progressive disease in the affected eye, enrollment will be suspended with the conclusion the therapy does 
not meet the criteria for a treatment sufficient interest for this endpoint.  
If few er or greater than 31  patients are evaluable for the need for chemotherapy endpoint, the cutoff for the 
number of patients who require systemic chemotherapy will be adjusted to preserve the probability of 
identifying the therapy as not of sufficient intere st for further examination to be at least 90% when the true 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1

Assessment of Rate of Metastases of Retinoblastoma 
Metastatic Disease Failure : Patients will be considered for the evaluation of metastatic disease provided 
the individual receives at least 1 dose of IA therapy and is followed until the patient experiences disease 
progression or relapse, is diagnosed with a second malignant neoplas m, dies or completes two years of 
follow-up without any of the aforementioned events occurring, whichever occurs first.  The new finding of 
extraocular disease after the initiation of protocol therapy will be considered metastatic disease failure.  
Appearanc e of intraocular tumor in the other eye either during or after protocol therapy will not be 
considered metastatic disease. Appearance of an isolated pineal tumor during therapy and follow up will 
not be considered as metastatic recurrence especially in the context of a young patient with a genetic 
predisposition to developing bilateral/trilateral retinoblastoma.     
 
Design for Assessing Rate of Metastatic Disease Incidence: The primary analytic endpoint of this trial will 
be feasibi lity of delivery of IA therapy. The accrual target for this study will not be adjusted for the number 
of patients considered not evaluable for the metastatic disease endpoint.  
The probability of metastatic disease will be assessed after 31 feasibility -evaluabl e patients have bee n 
enrolled. If all 31 such patients are evaluable for metastatic disease incidence, the foll owing design will be 
employed. If 1 or fewer patients experience metastatic disease, (observed rate of metastatic disease 
incidence: 3.2%), we will consider the therapy to have a sufficiently low rate of metastatic disease to be 
considered for further evaluation; otherwise, the data will be considered indicative of an excessi ve rate of 
metastatic disease. If the true rate of metastases is 0.10, the therapy will be considered of to have an 
excessive rate of metastases probability 83%. If the true rate of metastases is 0.03, the therapy will be considered have a sufficiently low rate of m etastases with probability 76%.  If, at any time, 2 or more 
patients experience m etastatic disease as defined above, the COG DSMC will be notified and CTEP 
consulted regarding the next steps to tak e with respect to the protocol.  
Because of the definition of evaluability for feasibility, the number of patients evaluable for the occurre nce 
of metastatic disease may differ from 31. In such cases the cutoff for the number of patients who are 
diagnosed with metastatic disease as defined above with be adjusted to preserve the probability of 
identifying the therapy as having an excessive metastatic disease probability to be at least 80% when the 
true probability of metastatic disease  is 10%. Examples of such adjustments are provided in the following 
table.

Evaluation of the toxicities and adverse events associated with delivering multiple doses of intra -arterial 
chemotherapy: The occurrence of each Grade 3 or higher CTC AE adverse experience will be recorded in 
each patient -cycle. The percent age of patients with each toxicity will be tabulated per cycle according to 
the methodology in place for the study progress report at the time. 
 The study will be temporarily suspended for evaluation if there is any episode of stroke or death and the 
study will be terminated if it is determined that the IA procedure was a significant cause.  
 Evaluation of vision outcomes in children treated with intra -arterial chemotherapy: All patients who retain 
the affected eye 1 year after completion of therapy will be evaluated for visual acuity according to the 
Amblyopia Treatment Study V isual Acuity Testing Protocol. The mean visual acuity that will be obtained 
1 year after protocol therapy will be estimated by the average visual acuity amongst patients evaluated

Evaluation of the effects of intra -arterial therapy on the histopathology of eyes enucleated for progression : 
The monitoring rule for ocular salvage will limit the number of eyes available for evaluation. We project a 
maximum of 25 eyes will be availab le for evaluation. As noted in Section 2.0 , various characteristics such 
as viable vitreous seeds and invasion into the optic nerve were observed. In previous examinations there 
has also been evidence of ischemic atrophy involving the outer retina and choroid as well as extensive 
choroidal and outer retinal atrophy. The proportion of enucleated eyes with each of these various 
characteristics will be calculated, as well as the 95% confidence intervals. The expected size of the 
confidence intervals, as a function of the number of eyes available and relative f requency of the particular 
characteristic.

Monitoring for complications of catheter insertion:  
The analytic unit for this outcome is the patient- catheter insertion. Each time a catheter insertion procedure 
is performed, the patient will be monitored for the subsequent 48 hours for the occurrence of any of the 
following complications: (1) thrombosis of the femoral artery; (2) dissection of any artery; (3) hematoma 
at the site of insertion of 3 centimeters or more in diameter; (4) emboli cerebral; or (5) any embolus in the 
lower extremity that results in vascular insufficiency. If any of these 5 events a catheter event will b e 
considered to have occurred. Otherwise, the  patient will be considered free of catheter events for that 
particular insertion. 
 
A Bayesian monitoring rule will be used to assess the consistency of the data with a catheter event rate that 
does not exceed 20% with high probability . Each analytic unit will be considered independent of all other 
analytic units. A beta prior with α=0.2 and β=0.8 to represent that the maximum complication rate 
considered acceptable as 20% with a substantial standard deviation to quantify the uncertainty regarding the complication rate. At each review of the study data where 10 or more patient -catheter insertion instance 
have occurred, the posterior probability of an excessive complication rate will be calculated as:

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA 
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
This study will utilize the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity 
and performance reporting. The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised 
CTCAE version 4.0 will be utilized for reporting beginning October 1st, 2010. All 
appropriate treatment areas should hav e access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0, 
which can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
10.2 Response Criteria  
There are no established response criteria for retinoblastoma that describe the response of 
the entire eye inclusive of all retinal lesions and vitreous disease. The response criteria 
defined below will NOT be use d as study endpoints, but will be used to gather preliminary 
information on overall response and patterns of  failure of eyes treated on this protocol 
therapy that may be useful in designing response criteria for future  protocols. RetCam 
images will be submitted centrally to correlate with reported response from treating site. 
The study endpoint will be defined only by Section 10.3  Definition of Disease Progression 
for an individual eye. 
 
10.2.1 Type I or IV Response  
Complete Type I regression pattern with calcification or Type IV with flat chorioretinal scars, or avascular,  linear, white gliosis regression of all retinal 
tumors documented by at least two EUA’s minimum of three weeks apart. No evidence of active vitreous tumor. No evidence of new lesions. Complete response 
is dated from the time all lesions have complete regression.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 39 
 
10.2.2 Type II or III Response  
Reduction in size with Type II or III regression pattern in some lesions (i.e. not all 
lesions have Type I  and/or Type IV regression pattern). No evidence of active 
vitreous tumor. Partial response is dated from the time of first observation. In addition, there can be no appearance of new lesions or progression of any lesion. 
 
10.2.3 Stable Disease (SD)  
No change in size/regression of retinal tumors and/or persistence of any active 
vitreous tumor. No evidence of new lesions. 
 
10.2.4 Local Recurrence  
Tumor regrowth at prior sites and/or new sites of retinal tumors that can be 
controlled by local therapy and/or plaque. 
 
10.2.5 Retinal Recurrence  
Tumor regrowth at prior sites and/or new sites of retinal tumors that canNOT be controlled by local therapy and/or plaque. 
 
10.2.6 Subretinal Recurrence  
Tumor regrowth involving expansion of new onset of subretinal seeding. 
 
10.2.7 Vitreal Recurrence  
Tumor regrowth involving expansion or new onset of vitreous seeding. 
 
10.2.8 Extraocular R ecurrence  
Tumor regrowth involving optic nerve, and/or orbit. 
 
10.2.9 Metastatic Systemic Recurrence  
Tumor metastases to bone, bone marrow, lymph node, brain and/or other distant organ outside eye.  
 
10.3 Definition of Disease Progression  for an Individual Eye 
Any tumor regrowth requiring enucleation and/or external beam radiation, and/or further 
chemotherapy beyond that given per protocol . At the time of disease progression , the 
pattern of recurrence will be specified using the Response Criteria (10.2.4-10.2.9) by 
choosing all sites of recurrence that apply.  Any extraocular recurrence and/or metastatic 
systemic recurrence will be considered disease progression and the patient will be considered treatment failure.

11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents .  
 
11.2 Determination of Reporting Requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) the characteristics of 
the adverse event including the grade (severity) ; 2) the relationship to the study therapy  
(attribution); and 3) the pri or experience (expectedness) of the adverse event . 
  
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from 
a commercial source. In some cases an agent obtained commercially may be used for indications not included in the package label. In addition, NCI may on some occasions distribute commercial supplies for a trial. Even in these cases, the agent is still considered 
to be a commercial agent and the procedures described below should be followed. 
 
Determine the prior experien ce Expected events are those that have been previously 
identified as resulting from administration of the agent.  An adverse event is considered 
unexpected, for reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of 
the event is not liste d in:  
• The current known toxicities for each commercial agent as provided in the 
Drug Information for Commercial Agents Used by the Children’s Oncology 
Grou p posted on the COG website; or 
• The drug package insert  
 
 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy (eg, 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary malignancy.  
 
All secondar y malignancies that occur following treatment need to be reported via CTEP -
AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy.  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
 
11.3 Report ing of Adverse Events for Commercial  Agents - CTEP -AERS  abbreviated 
pathway 
 
Commercial reporting requirements are provided in Table B. The commercial agent(s) used 
in this study are listed in the front of this protocol immediately following the Study 
Committee roster.   
 
• COG requires the CTEP -AERS  report to be submitted within 7 calendar  days  of 
learning of the event.  
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 41 
during trial registration on all reports.  
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:   The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will 
be utilized for AE reporting and are located on the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.

commercial agent, regardless of attribution. Any death that occurs more than 
30 days after the last dose of treatment with a commercial agent which can 
be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not  due to 
cancer recurrence must be reported via CTEP -AERS . 
 
11.4 Routine Adv erse Event Reporting  
Note:  The guidelines below are for routine reporting of study specific adverse events on 
the COG case report forms and do not affect the requirements for CTEP- AERS  reporting. 
 
The NCI defines both routine and expedited AE reporting.  Routine reporting is 
accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study 
database.   For this study, routine reporting will include all toxicities reported via CTEP -
AERS  and all Grade 3 and higher Adverse Events.  
 
 
12.0 STUDY REPORTING  AND MONITORING   
The Case Report Forms and the submission schedule are posted on the COG web site with each 
protocol under “ Data Collection/Specimens ”. A submission schedule is included.  
 
12.1 CDUS  
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) . Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due 
January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31. This is not a responsibility of institutions 
participating in this trial.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 42 
12.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
To protect the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all clinical trial research 
by the Children’s Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Comm ittee 
(DSMC) reviews reports of interim analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by the study statistician, in conjunction with the study chair’s report. The DSMC may 
recommend the study be modified or terminated based on these analyses.   
 
Toxicity  monitoring is also the responsibility of the study committee  and any unexpected 
frequency of serious events on the trial is to be brought to the attention of the DSMC. The 
study statistician is responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is expected to 
request DSMC review of any protocol issues s/he feels require special review. Any COG 
member may bring specific study concerns to the attention of the DSMC.  
 
The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by the study commi ttee prior to 
implementation (e .g., termination, dropping an arm based on toxicity results or other trials 
reported, increasing target sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines whether and to whom outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified 
in the protocol document. 
 
 
13.0 SPECIAL STUDIES SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS  
13.1 Visual Assessment Study  
This study will test the visual acuity  of the affected eye using a single surround HOTV , also  known 
as the amblyopia treatment study visual acuity protocol . The test will be performed by either an 
ophthalmologist or their appropriately trained designate – an optometrist, ophthalmic technician 
or orthoptist. 
 
This study is required for all patients  who complete all three courses of IA melphalan treatment  
and retain the affected eye one year after the completion of therapy . Most children on this study  
will be between 3- 5 years of age

of protocol therapy .  
 
13.2 Histopathology of Eyes Enucleated for Disease Progression  
This optional study is open to patients who are removed from protocol therapy due to disease progression or due to parent’s request or physician recommendation and subsequently undergo 
enucleation. This study is designed carefully to assess eyes enucleated due to retinoblastoma for the presence certain histopathologic features that are known or suspected to a ffect prognosis 
adversely and to evaluate the changes associated to intra- arterial chemotherapy. See Appendix II
 
for tissue handling guidelines.

14.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING   
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor  unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable p er COG 
administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol). 
14.1 Imaging Guidelines  
CT and MRI guidelines are available on the COG Member site at:  
https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/reference/RefMaterial/DiagnosticIma
gingGuidelines_MRI&CT.pdf . 
 
See also Section 10  for overview of response assessm ent and preferred imaging studies.  
 Patients should have the traditional imaging/staging studies performed at their treating 
hospital for diagnosis (see Table 7.1.1
).  
 
MRI with and without gadolinium of head and orbits is required 2 weeks prior to study 
entry, at end of protocol therapy  and every 6 months for 2 years during follow -up for all 
patients.  If MRI is not available, CT with and without contrast may be substituted.   
 
MRI may have advantages over  CT, especially for intraocular disease, and is thus 
recommended, but not required. It should not be used in place of ophthalmologic exams. 
If MRI is used, it is recommended that both post - gadolinium T1- weighted images be 
obtained for surveillance of intr acranial disease, including trilateral retinoblastoma and 
orbital T2- weighted MRI of the eye with fast spin echo (FSE) and surface coils (thin section 
3-D FSE T2 -weighted sequence) be obtained for surveillance of intraocular disease.4,6,20  
 Head MRI’s (or CT) done at stud y entry and for surveillance are NOT required to be 
submitted for central review. There will be central review of RetCam images and imaging studies that are required for the evaluation  of the radiation therapy.

Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 45 
15.0 GUIDELINES FOR RADIOACTIVE PLAQUE TREATMENT  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from  protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG 
administrative Policy 5.14 (except whe re explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
Radiation t herapy  (RT)  for patients on COG protocols can only be delivered at approved 
COG RT facilities (per COG administrative policy 3.9).  
 
No external beam radiation therapy including intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery,  or proton beam therapy is permitted on this 
protocol. Plaque brachytherapy is the only radiotherapy permitted by protocol.   
For eyes that fail protocol therapy by definitions in Section 10.3
, the further therapy will be 
determined at the discretion of the treating physician and will not be mandated by this protocol.  
15.1 Timing  
There must be at least 6 weeks between the last local ophthalmic therapy (any included in 
Section 16 ) or systemic chemotherapy (whichever was later) and the start of plaque 
radiotherapy 
15.2 Isotope  
Iodine-125 or Ruthenium- 106 can be utilized for plaques.  
15.3 Plaque Size  
The plaque size is chosen so that the tumor base is covered entirely by the plaque with a 
tumor free margin of at least 1 – 2 mm on all sides. (For example, a tumor with a basal 
diameter of 10 mm would be plaqued with a plaque of at least 12-14 mm in diameter.)  
An exception is permissible if the tumor is < 2 mm of the optic nerve. In this case, the 
plaque may be trimmed (or “notched”) around the optic nerve so that the posterior edge of 
the plaque lies between the optic nerve and the posterior edge of the tumor.  
15.4 Radiation Dose 
The tumor dose is prescri bed at the apex of the tumor. The dose rate at the prescription 
point must be > 0.4 Gy/h but < 0.8 Gy/h. 
 Three dimensional (3D) treatment planning is encouraged. International Commision on 
Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Reports 50, 62, and 72 ( www.icru.org
) define 
prescription methods and nomenclature that will be utilized for this study. Imaging studies for this protocol must have slice thicknesses of 1 mm or less. Treatment planning will be 
based on the following definitions: 
 
Gross target volume (GTV)  is the volume of disease seen on planning imaging studies.  
 Clinical target volume (CTV)  is equal to the GTV  
 
Planning target volume (PTV)  is equal to CTV. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 46 
 
If two dimensional (2D) treatment planning is employed, the thickness of the tumor is 
defined as the distance from the interior surface of the sclera to the apex of the tumor. The 
sclera is assumed to be 1 mm thick.  Thus, if a tumor is said to be 3 mm thick, the point of 
dose prescription is 4 mm from the surface of the radioactive plaque, i.e. 3 mm thick tumor 
+ 1 mm thick sclera = 4 mm. If the plaque is placed over one of the ocular muscles, the plaque must be considered to be 1 mm away from the external surface of the sclera, i.e. 3 
mm thick tumor + 1 mm thick sclera + 1 mm muscle thickness = 5 mm. If overlying 
vitreous seeds are present, the dose is designed to include those seeds.  
 
The prescription dose to the tumor apex is 36 Gy  and will serve as the prescription 
dose for this protocol for both 2 D and 3D treatment planning.  
 
This dose, with allowance for minor deviations of up to 10%  or up to 39.6 Gy, has 
supportive data for safety in salvaged eyes in multiple series .
21,22  
 
15.5 Normal tissue dosimetry  
The organs at risk guidelines in this section are recommendations. If the recommended 
doses to the org ans at risk are exceeded because of target volume coverage requirements 
or other conditions, and explanation should be included in the quality assurance documentation.  
 
Table 15.5 : Organs at risk (OAR) and Planning organ at risk (PRV) dose guidelines for 3D 
treatment planning  
Organ  Volume (%)  Dose (Gy)  
Lens  100%  18 Gy  
Optic Nerve  100%  54 Gy  
Lacrimal Gland  100%  30 Gy  
 
15.5.1 For 3D treatment planning the following defines required normal tissue DVH data:  
 
Sclera  
Defined as a 1 mm thick shell making up the radiographic “edge” of the eye. For 
the purposes of this study the cornea wil l be included in this volume for simplicity.  
No scleral necrosis was seen in the salvage series from C. L. Shields, et al. with tumor base dose of 120 Gy and maximal tumor base dose of 358 Gy with 5- year 
follow-up.
21,22 
 Optic nerve  
The optic nerve will generally be shielded by the lip of the plaque and exposure 
minimized by careful plaque positioning. 
 
Lacrimal Gland  
 
Lens

Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 47 
15.5.2 For 2D treatment planning the following define required  
Sclera 
The dose to the sclera is estimated and reported at a point on the central axis of the 
plaque 1 mm from the surface of the plaque. This point is approximately coincident 
with the internal surface of the sclera near the center of the tumor.  
 
Optic nerve   
The dose to the center of the optic disc is calculated and rep orted.  
 
Contralateral Retina  (same eye)  
The dose to the retina opposite the tumor is calculated and reported. The dose is 
calculated 16 mm from the scleral surface at the base of the tumor measured along 
a diameter of the globe passing through the apex of  the tumor for infants ≤ 6 
months of age and 20 mm for patients > 6 months of age.  
Lens  
The dose to the center of the lens is calculated and reported.  
 
15.6 QA Documentation  
No on- treatment review will be required for this protocol. It is recognized that the dose 
distribution from brachytherapy implants is inherently non-uniform. 
 
15.6.1 Institutions are required to submit the treatment plan in digital format. 
Submission of treatment plans in digital format (either DICOM RT or RTOG 
format) is required. Digital data must include CT scans, structures, plan, and dose 
files. Submission may be by either sFTP or CD. Instructions for data submission 
are on the IROC Rho de Island (QARC)  web site at www.qarc.org  under "Digital 
Data." Any items on the list below that are not part of  the digital submission may 
be included with the transmission of the digital RT data via sFTP or submitted separately. Screen captures are preferred to hard copy for items that are not part of 
the digital plan.  
 15.6.2 Supportive Data  
•_All diagnostic im aging used to plan the target volume. Digital format is required 
(DICOM).  
•_Radiotherapy record (treatment chart) including prescription and daily and 
cumulative doses to all required areas and organs at risk.  This included copies 
of the procedure notes related to the placement and the removal of the plaque.  
• _If the recommended doses to the organs at risk are exceeded, an explanation 
should be included for review by IROC Rhode Island (QARC)  and the radiation 
oncology reviewers.  
 
15.6.3 The Brachytherapy Physics Reporting Form available at www.QARC.org
 should 
be submitted for all patients treated with radioactive plaque treatment . The 
completed form should be scanned and e -mailed to DataSubmission@QARC.org 
or faxed to IROC Rhode Island (QARC) .

16.0 OPHTHALMOLOGIC GUIDELINES  
16.1 Local T herapy  
Local therapy is used to eradicate local disease after reduction of the tumor volume by 
chemotherapy and may include cryotherapy, green laser, infrared laser and/or radioactive 
plaque. See Section 15.0  for Plaque Guidelines. The goal of local therapy is to achieve Type 
I regression pattern with calcification or Type IV with flat chorioretinal scars, or avascular, linear, white gliosis.  
 
16.1.1 Cryoablation 
Cryotherapy can be utilized following the completion of the first cycle of IA  
melphalan , for ablating tumor remnants/recurrences after protocol therapy  up to 3 
mm in height that are located at or anterior to the equator. Tumors will be treated 
with 3 freeze -thaw cycles at each session. The ice ball wil l be allowed to thaw 
completely between freezes. Tumor, including any overlying vitreous seeds, must be completely enclosed by ice to be considered treated. If the lesion has an extensive 
base, part of the lesion (up to 4 sites) may be frozen in one sessio n and then the 
additional part of the lesion at a later session with next EUA. It is recommended that no more than 4 different sites be frozen in one eye at a single session. The only 
acceptable regression patterns following cryotherapy are either flat cho rioretinal 
scars or chorioretinal scars with a central calcific deposit; achieving this may require multiple treatments. There is less likelihood of creating vitreous seeds with 
cryotherapy if a tumor has been previously treated with chemotherapy. Extensiv e 
cryotherapy has been associated with significant persistent retinal detachment, particularly if the retina was originally detached prior to chemotherapy. Retinal breaks can be caused by cryotherapy. Including calcified Type I regression in the ice 
ball s hould be avoided if possible. The site of transition between the retina and the 
calcific mass is at risk to develop a retinal break following cryotherapy.  
 
16.1.2 Green Laser Photoablation  
After cycle one of IA melphalan , green laser (argon or 532 nm) can be used to ablate  
tumors up to 8 mm in thickness, especially posterior to the equator following 
chemotherapy. The shorter wave -length 532 nm laser is selected when there is a 
minimal amount of underlying pigmentation to absorb the energy. Through a widely 
dilated pupil, a 500µ spot size is delivered directly to the tumor by indirect 
ophthalmoscopy (the 28D indirect lens gives a larger laser spot on the lesion than 
the 20D lens), at a low energy output, increasing the power by 50 mW increments 
until “blanching” or gentle “whitening” of the tumor occurs. This end- point is 
established at the edge of the tumor with a portion of the spot on the normal retina. Begin with a power of 200 -300 mW and do not exceed 700 mW or 1000 mse c. 
 
The tumor is outlined with burns half on and half off the retina. There should be 30% 
spot overlap. After outlining the tumor, the entire tumor should be covered with 30 
% overlapping spots. The “take” may not be obvious in thicker parts of the tumor. 
Complete coverage is considered “1 laser treatment”. Each numbered lesion should receive a minimum of 3 complete “laser treatments” with only one “complete laser 
treatment” given at each EUA.

The response to laser energy depends to a large extent on the amount of pigmentation 
underlying the area being treated. In patients with significant pigmentation, 
relatively little energy is needed to achieve end -point. Within pigmented scars, the 
uptake of energy varies with the amount of pigment and the exposure has  to be 
adjusted accordingly. In lightly pigmented fundi, more energy is required to achieve 
end point. Small hemorrhages may occur within tumors.  
 
The immediate response to the green laser is whitening of the retina and tumor. 
Reduced volume and increased translucency of the tumor is considered a good 
outcome response, but a flat scar with pigment epithelial proliferation is preferred. Several laser sessions may be required to achieve this. The green laser used with excessive power might cause hemorrhage or  breaks in Bruch’s membrane. Laser -
induced hemorrhage has been associated with vitreous seeding. Inadequate dilation of the pupil can cause laser burns to the iris.  
 
16.1.3 Infrared Laser Photablation 
Infrared laser can be selected to treat RB tumors up to  8 mm thickness that have an 
intact retinal pigment epithelium following IA melphalan . Either the 810 nm diode 
or 1064 nm continuous wave YAG laser apparently has a similar effect on RB 
tumors. Using the operating microscope or indirect ophthalmoscope deli very 
system, a spot size ≥ 1000 -2000 µ is applied directly to the tumor. Starting with a 
low power at 1- second durations, the power or time is gradually increased until a 
slight whitening is observed, which is then applied to the entire surface of the tumor. 
Do not exceed 800 MW in power. Although very little response may be seen acutely 
with the infrared laser, subsequent observations will show a decrease in tumor 
volume with good response. Complete response often results in a residual flat mass, with a white, gliotic appearance, devoid of tum or vessels. This response may be very 
difficult to interpret and the activity can only be judged by repeated observations. The use of excessive power may result in hemorrhage or vitreous dissemination of 
tumor, but starting with low power and gradually inc reasing avoids these problems.  
 
16.1.4 Plaque Radiotherapy 
Plaque radiotherapy may be used to treat local recurrences up to 8 mm in thickness 
and 15 mm in base. See Section 15.0 for guidelines. Proliferative r etinopathy 
secondary to plaque will be monitored on this study, with an early stopping rule if incidence is > 15 % (See 
Statistical Section  9.0). 
 
16.1.5 Frequency of Local Ablative Therapy 
An EUA will then be done within 1 week prior to each cycle of IA melphalan and 
within 4 weeks of completion of the t hird cycle of IA Melphalan. After completion 
of protocol therapy, an EUA is recommended every 1 -4 months until age 3 years, 
then every 4 -6 months until age 5 years, then 6- 12 months. Patients should be 
transitioned to an office exam without anesthesia when old enough to cooperate in 
an effort to ensure that anterior recurrences are not missed, B -scan ultrasonography 
can be used as an adjunct to the office indirect ophthalmoloscopy when scleral depression is not possible.

FIXATION, GROSSING AND SUBMISSION FOR HISTOLOGIC EXAMINATION:  
 
Fixation  
The specimen should be fixed immediately after enucleation. Since th e eye has failed therapy 
harvesting of fresh tumor is not recommended. The eye should be immersed in a container of 50-100 
mL of 10% Formalin. At least 48 hours of fixation are recommended. Do not open cornea or sclera or inject formalin.  
 Basic Goals of Histopathologic Evaluation 
The histopathology part of this study is designed carefully to assess eyes enucleated for retinoblastoma for the presence certain histopathologic features that are know n or suspected to affect prognosis 
adversely and to evaluate the changes associated to intra- arterial chemotherapy.  
 

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 53 
These include:  
• The presence or absence of tumor in the optic nerve surgical margin.  
• The presence and depth of optic nerve invasion , especial ly the presence of retrolaminar nerve 
 invasion 
• The presence and degree of uveal stromal invasion i.e. infiltration of the stroma of the choroid, 
 ciliary body and/or iris, including the presence of grossly visible or massive invasion. For the 
 purpose of this study  massive invasion is defined as follows  
 I: Posterior uveal invasion absent 
 II: Posterior uveal invasion present  
IIA: Largest dimension of intrachoroidal tumor on slide less than 1 mm 
 IIB: Largest dimension between 1 -3 mm 
 IIC: Largest dimension greater than 3 mm ( MASSIVE) 
 IID: Posterior uveal tumor noted grossly ( MASSIVE) 
 The presence of extraocular extension and orbital invasion  
 
Treatment Effect  
• Other histologic features with potential prognostic significance include invasion of the  anterior  
 chamber and trabecular meshwork, and invasion of the scleral and scleral emissarial canals.  
• Changes in the tumor (calcification, giant cells, macrophages, necrosis) 
• Changes in retina and choroid (vascularization, necrosis, atrophy, ischemic chan ges, 
 inflammation)  
• Changes in optic nerve vasculature and cellularity  
• Foreign body reaction in any structure of the eye 
• Anterior chamber changes (cataract, neovascularization of iris)  
• Vascular changes  
 
Grossing Eyes: General Principles and Technique  
 The P-O Segment  
Routinely, histologic sections of eyes are cut from a paraffin block that includes a short cylindrical  
anteroposterior segment of the globe called the P-O or pupil -optic nerve segment. The P-O segment  
includes most of the cornea, iris and pupil anteriorly and the optic nerve posteriorly (Figure 1 & 3). 
 
The Calottes 
The dome- shaped caps of tissue that are removed when the P -O segment is prepared are called calottes  
(French for visor -less cap). The first calotte should include about one-fourth or one -fifth of the 
peripheral anterior chamber. The first calotte should also include the scleral window if one has been 
performed (Figure 1& 3). 
 
Standard Measurements 
Before the globe is opened, a standard series of measurements are made using a caliper o r a millimeter 
rule. The A -P (anteroposterior including the cornea) and the horizontal and vertical dimensions 
(viewed from the front) are measured and recorded in that order. The length of the attached 
segment of optic nerve is also recorded. The horizont al and vertical diameter of the cornea and the 
diameter of the pupil also are recorded (Figure 2). The iris color is also noted.  
 
 Globe: AP, Horizontal, Vertical, length of optic nerve. 
 Cornea - horizontal and vertical 
 Diameter of pupil  
 Other Lesions of  interest - (if any, approximate dimension of intraocular tumor.)

FIGURE 2  
 
Preparing the main P- O Segment  
Eyes should be carefully sectioned using a standard double-edge razor blade or half a blade, which has 
been snapped in half within its protective wrapper. The two ends of the blade are held between the 
apposed surfaces of the thumb and forefinger. The blade is oriented perpendicular to the dissector’s 
chest and a gentle sawing motion is used. A scalpel should never be used to open an eye because it 
tends to indent and compress the eye too forcefully (Figure 3). 
 
 
 
FIGURE 3  
 Removing the First Calotte 

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 55 
During the initial cut (removal of the first calotte), the eye is placed corneal side -down on the cutting 
block and steadied with the non- dominant hand. Guidelines drawn on the eye with colored pencil 
facilitate sectioning and help to assure that the eye is oriented properly prior to sectioning. The incision 
is started posteriorly and extended anteriorly. At the start of the incision, the blade is positi oned close to 
the optic nerve, but external to its dural sheath. A gentle sawing motion is used. Try not to bend the blade during sectioning. In addition, care must be taken to avoid compressing the eye too forcefully, as this can collapse the eye and expr ess the tumor and intraocular contents. The cut should enter the 
periphery of the anterior chamber anteriorly. The first calotte should include about one -fifth to one -
fourth of th e peripheral anterior chamber (F igure 3A). 
 Stereomicroscopic Examination 
After the first calotte is removed, the eye should be examined with a dissecting microscope. If uveal  
invasion by tumor is noted or suspected grossly it should be documented. 
 
Removing the Second Calotte 
The second calotte is then removed. This is most easily  done by placing the eye cut- surface down on 
the cutting block, and making a second parallel cut (Figure 3B- D). 
 
The main PO segment is submitted. At least two levels comprising 10 slides each that include the 
central  portion of the optic nerve head should be cut. 
 Submission of Additional Tissue Segments from the Calottes to Exclude Uveal Invasion.  
It is extremely important to examine the residual tissue in the calottes to exclude uveal stromal 
invasion that may not be evident grossly. 
Both calottes should  be sectioned in a “breadloaf” fashion and submitted entirely (Figure 3E- F). 
If a significant amount of tumor is present in a calotte, one may choose to prepare an addition A- P 
segment of the entire globe prior to preparing the breadloafed segments.

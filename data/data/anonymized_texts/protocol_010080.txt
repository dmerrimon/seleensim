FDY -5301  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 7 of 61 Methodology:  This is a Phase 2A, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center st udy that 
will evaluate  safety, efficacy and PK of FDY -5301 in  subjects with acute STEMI undergoing 
PCI. 
Up to 1 60 patients will be randomized to obtain a final sample size of 80 evaluable patients. 
By evaluable, we mean that a patient must have a complete dataset with regard to measures 
of arrhythmia data and infarc t size. 
Subjects will receive either FDY -5301 or volume matched placebo after informed consent is 
obtained and a STEMI diagnosis has been made based on clinica l and ECG findings, within 
an hour  prior to myocardial reperfusion.  
All subjects will have an ea rly CMR , 14 days of arrhythmia monitoring , and will be followed 
up for safety and efficacy for up to 6 months. Subjects will be monitored in hospital, and 
return for clinic visits at  day 14, day 30 and 3 months post PCI . 
At the clinic  visits, subjects will undergo evaluation to include  measurement of laboratory 
safety parameters , adverse events, ECG . At the 3 month clinic visit, infarct size will also be 
assessed by CMR , and the presence of any persistent arrhythmias will be assessed b y the 
investigator using an ECG rhythm strip . Follow up by phone to determine all cause and 
cardiac mortality status  will occur at 6 months post-study drug . If the subject is unavailable 
then mortality status will be obtained from physician/investigator records.  
Number of patients : Up to 1 60 patients  
Diagnosis and main criteria for 
inclusion:  1. 18-80 year old male subjects  
2. 18 to 80 year old female  subjects who are not of child -bearing potential  
3. Accepted for Primary PCI with diagnosis of first STEMI, based on clinical and ECG 
criteria (ST -elevation at the J -point in two contiguous leads with the cut -off points: 
≥0.2 millivolt (mV) in men or ≥0.15 mV in women in leads V2 -V3 and/or ≥0.1 mV in 
other leads) within 12 hours of symptom onset  
4. Written i nformed consent  prior to study participation  (either by the subject or a

Exclusion Criteria:  1. Previous myocardial infarction  
2. Left bundle branch block (LBBB)  
3. Previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery  (CABG)  
4. Major hemodynamic instability or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia s 
5. Known contraindication  to CMR ( e.g. pacemaker)  
6. Patients with known  thyroid disease , or known a llergy to iodide  
7. Subjects with past or current renal impairment requiring dialys is 
8. Pregnant or females of childbearing potential  
9. Body weight > 12 0 kg or Body Mass Index (BMI) >  35 kg/m2  
10. Use of investigational drugs or devices within 30 days prior to  enrollment into the 
study  
11. Life expectancy of less than 1 year due to non -cardiac pathology  
12. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the time of screening that in the 
judgment of the Investigator or any sub -Investigator would preclude safe comp letion 
of the study  
 
Investigational product, dosage and 
mode of administration:  FDY -5301 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg or placebo will be administered intravenously  
(IV) by bolus injection between  an hour and 5 minutes prior to coronary artery reperfusion.  
Duration of treatment:  
  Treatment is a single IV bolus administration of study drug. Each subject will be involved up 
to 6 months from screening until study exit.  
Reference therapy, dosage and 
mode of administration:  Placebo (normal saline  for injection). Placebo will be indistinguishable from FDY -5301.  
Statistical methods:  The primary outcome for this study  will be t he combined number  and incidence rate of 
Faraday Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,   
FDY -5301  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 9 of 61 several  arrhythmias of interest that occur in each group over a 14 day period post-study drug . 
These arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation, sustained  ventricular tachycardia  (≥125 
BPM, ≥ 30 seconds), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (≥ 125 BPM, ≥ 16 beats, < 30 
seconds) and high degree AV block ( 2nd or 3rd degree, ≥ 8  beats) were chosen because they 
are significant prognostic indicators of depressed left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac 
death [ 1]. The combined number of arrhythmic events in each group will be calculated along 
with the arrhythmia incidence rate defined as the percentage of patients in each group 
experiencing at least one of the defined arrhythmias of interest.  
An exploratory  sub-analysis will be conducted to determine the number and incidence  rate of 
each separate arrhythmia type per dose group.  
Little data exists on the incidence of arrhythmias that occur over an extended period of time 
following AMI and monitoring strategies for this type of assessment have not been optimized 
in a clinical trial  setting. The primary goal of our study is to characterize the occurrence  of 
arrhythmias in this patient population for 14 days post -AMI and to determine the feasibility 
of using ambulatory patch  ECG  monitors to capture this data.  These data should be reg arded 
as exploratory with the objective of identifying a meaningful clinical end point that can be 
easily measured in future , pivotal studies that are adequately powered to detect differences 
across treatment groups.     
As this is the first clinical study  in patients, safety is the primary focus. For this reason, the 
goal is to enroll  a limited number of patients to FDY -5301 while still powering the study to 
detect significant differences in efficacy measures across groups. Estimating a drop -out rate 
of 50%, we will need to enroll up to 1 60 patients in order to obtain a final total  sample size of 
80 patients . A final sample size of 80 patients will provide  80% power to detect a 37% 
reduction  in INF/VV assuming an SD of 10%, a 24% increase in MSI assuming an  SD of 
20% and a 39% reduction in Troponin AUC with an SD of 60%. Equal variance was 
assumed among groups with an unbalanced allocation of patients to placebo (n=20) and 
combined FDY -5301 treatment groups (n=60).

Between group comparisons of infarct size as a proportion of ventricular volume ( INF/VV), 
the myocardial salvage index (MSI) , and absolute MI size ( INF) at 72 +/- 24 hours  and 3 
months post PCI as measured by CMR  will be p erformed . 
 
 
The proportion of patients with ST -segment resolution at 4 hours post study drug . 
Serum levels of troponin calculated as AUC  0-48 hours  post study drug.  
Cardiac -related adverse events including the development of heart failur e out to 3 months of 
follow up  
The incidence of all cause and cardiac mortality out to 6 months post PCI . 
In addition to the measurement of safety and efficacy parameters in this study, serum 
biomarker levels of cardiac injury , inflammation and remodeling will also be assessed .  
After the 14 day follow up visit  to the clinic , analysis of all subjects’ data will be collected 
and analyzed for safety (arrhythmias) and early efficacy outcomes . 
After the 3 month  follow up visit,  analysis of efficacy outcomes including final MSI, 
INF/VV, INF  parameters and car diac function including EDV, ESV, FS and EF will be 
analyzed. All remaining assessments will be analyzed at the conclusion of the  study .  
For P K analysis, Cmax, AUC , Tmax and T1/2 will be calculated for each dose based on plasma 
iodide levels.

3.1 Disease  
The first line of therapy for STEMI includes coronary artery reperfusion by mechanical means (angioplasty). While clearly effective, 
it does  not address the issue of “reperfusion injury”, a secondary damage that develops due to the revascularization of the previousl y 
ischemic myocardial tissue. Even though angioplasty ha s dramatically improved the survival rate, the goal of developing FDY -5301  in 
AMI is to reduce infarct size, and consequent ly improve short and longer -term outcomes after AMI/reperfusion.  
3.2 FDY -5301 Background  
FDY -5301 product (herein after referred to as FDY -5301) is sodium iodide formulated as an isotonic solution in a single us e vial for 
intravenous administration. The solution has a pH between 7.0 and 9.5. A monograph for sodium iodide is listed in the current  United 
States Pharmacopoeia (USP). The chemical formula of sodium iodide is NaI.  
The route of administration is by int ravenous (IV) injection .  
As discussed in the  Investigators Brochure  (IB), the nonclinical safety assessment of FDY -5301 includes pilot and Good Laboratory 
Practice ( GLP ) 7 and 14 day IV repeat dose toxicity studies, pharmacokinetic studies, local tolera bility  studies, a series of in vitro and 
in vivo safety pharmacology, in vitro hemocompatibility, in vitro cytochrome P450 inhibition, in vitro protein binding, and 
genotoxicity studies conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) guidelines . 
An IV bolus single dose toxicity study in rats showed that FDY -5301 was associated with no mortality in animals receiving bolus 
injections of up to 1000 mg/kg. Adverse clinical signs were not observed in either gender.  
In rats, no signs of toxicity were observed at doses up to 74 mg/kg given daily IV for 14 days. In beagle dogs the NOAEL was 
established at 20  mg/kg for 7 days dosing. The observed DLT at 40 mg/kg was reversible gastro -intestinal inflammation.   
Safety pharmacology studies included an in vitro hERG  K+ ion channel assay, a CNS safety pharmacology study (general signs and 
behavior) in rats, a pulmonary safety pharmacology study in rats, and a cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in dogs. Ove rall, the 
results of these studi es show that at the dosing regimen and at expected systemic exposures of FDY -5301 to be achieved in humans, 
no adverse effects are anticipated to occur in any of the major organ systems tested.

Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 21 of 61 FDY -5301 was found not to be mutagenic in the bacterial rever se mutation assay.  
Other studies with FDY -5301 show that the formulation to be used for clinical trials is not expected to cause local perivenous 
irritation. In addition, it does not exhibit protein binding  nor does it inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymatic ac tivity . FDY -5301 was also 
shown to be compatible with human, dog, and rat serum, plasma, and whole blood.  
As well as the extensive experience and known safety of orally administered iodide, it has been used intravenously in humans to 
manage thyrotoxic cris is. 
Faraday has conducted a phase 1 single ascending dose study in healthy volunteer subjects at intravenous doses of up to 10 mg/kg. No  
significant  adverse events were detected, including biochemical measures of thyroid function. The anticipated therapeut ic dose is 
likely in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg  based on nonclinical studies and human PK data . 
3.3 Rationale  
Preclinical pharmacology data to date show that FDY -5301 when administered in conjunction with the revascularization of previously 
ischemic myocardium significantly reduces infarct size, improves myocardial function and coronary perfusion, reduces neutrophil 
infiltration and down -regulates the inflammatory response in the reperfused myocardial tissue. FDY -5301 may reduce myocardial 
reperfusion  injury in patients with AMI undergoing revascularization, and consequently, reduce infarct size. No clinical trials in AMI 
patients have ye t been conducted with FDY -5301 . The anticipated human effective dose based on preclinical data is from 0.5 to 2.0 
mg/kg. The study outlined herein is designed to assess the safety , efficacy  and PK of FDY -5301 in patients with first STEMI about to 
undergo PCI.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety , efficacy, and pharmacokinetics  (PK) of three dose levels  of FDY -5301 compared to 
placebo in STEMI patients undergoing PCI . 
4.1 Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome for this study will be t he combined number  and incidence rate of se veral  arrhythmias of interest that occur in 
each group over a 14 day period post -study drug . These arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation, sustained  ventricular 
tachycardia  (≥125 BPM, ≥ 30 seconds), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (≥ 125 BPM, ≥ 16 beats, < 30 seconds) and high degree 
AV block ( 2nd or 3rd degree, ≥ 8 beats) were chosen because they are significant prognostic indicators of depressed left ventricular 
ejection fraction and cardiac death [ 1]. The combined number of arrhythmic events in each group will be calculated along with the 
arrhythmi a incidence rate defined as the percentage of patients in each group experiencing at least one of the defined arrhythmias of 
interest.  
An exploratory sub -analysis will be conducted to determine the number and incidence rate of each separate arrhythmia typ e per dose 
group.  
Continuous cardiac monitoring will occur for 14 days post PCI  by means of wearable patch devices . 
4.2 Secondary O utcomes  
Infarct size parameters will be assessed by CMR at 72 +/ - 24 hours  and 3 months ; the following will be compared between groups; 
infarct size as a propor tion of ventricular volume  (INF/VV) , myocardial salvage index (MSI) and a bsolute MI size .  
 
• The p roportion of patients with ST -segment resolution at 4 hours post study drug  
• Serum levels of troponin calculated as AUC  0-48 hours post -study drug  
• Persistent arrhythmias at 30 days and 3 months  
• Measures of cardiac function by CMR including end -diastolic volume (EDV), end -systolic volume (ESV), fractional 
shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF).   
• Serum biomarkers of cardiac in jury, inflammation  and remodeling  
•       Cardiac -related adverse events including the development of heart failure  out to 3 months of follow up  
• Incidence of all cause and cardiac mortality out to 6 months of follow up -to be assessed by phone call to patient  or if

Safety and Tolerability:  
Physical examination including vital signs, laboratory measures to include clinical chemistry, hematology and thyroid function tests  
will be performed . Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be recorded.  
12 lead ECGs will be perform ed at intervals at and post baseline .  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma iodide levels will be measured in each patient. The concentration -time profile of plasma  iodide will be derived for each of the 
groups. The pharmacokinetics of iodide will be described as area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), the maximal  
concentration (C max) and the time (T max) when the maximal concentration is achieved. The t erminal half -life (T 1/2), the total body 
clearance (CL), and the volume of distribution (V) will also be derived.

5.1 Overall Study Design  and Plan: Description  
This is a Phase 2A, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Multi -Center  Study of Intravenous FDY -5301 in Acute 
Myocardial Infarction (AMI).  
Study subjects will be recruited at each investigational site (or referred to the investigative site from another institution ) for treatment 
of first STEMI. Subjects will be screened and written informed  consent will be obtained prior to initiation of any study related 
procedures in those subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study.  
Up to 1 60 patients will be randomized to receive either FDY -5301 at doses of 0.5 m g/kg, 1.0mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg or placebo.  
STEMI diagnosis will be made based on clinical and ECG findings including: subjects presenting with ≥ 30 minutes of ischemic chest 
pain, within 12 hours of symptom onset, and  have persistent ST -segment elevation of ≥ 2  mm in at least 2 contiguous leads in ECG.  
  
Study drug administration will occur  by bolus injection  at any time  between an hour and 5 minutes prior to coronary reperfusion . 
All patients who receive study drug and have PCI will be followed up for safety and efficacy for 6 months post -study drug infusion. 
Subjects who do not undergo angioplasty for any reason who received study drug will be followed up for safety, but will be r eplaced 
with a new subject.  
5.2 Number of Centers/ Subjects  
This study will be conducted at up to 2 0 centers in the USA  and Europe. European  sites are not using this version of the protocol and 
will not be submitted to the IND. Up to 1 60 STEMI patients are plan ned for enrolment in this study to obtain a final sample size of 80 
patients.

MRI determination of MSI, MI size, MI/VV , and Cardiac Function  
Cardiac MRI  (CMR)  will be performed at 72 +/ - 24 hours and 3 months post -study drug at the 
study site.   
The 72 hour CMR will include  cine, T2W and LGE imaging  for function, edema and n ecrosis 
respectively . The 3 month CMR will include cine and LGE for function and late scar 
quantification respectively . 
The primary estimate of AAR and hence MSI will be based on CMR imaging of myocardium for 
edema (secondarily  the length of coronary arter y occluded will be document at the time of PCI).  
Cardiac function will be assessed  by CMR and defined  in terms of EDV, ESV, FS and EF.  
All MRI data will be analyzed at a central core laboratory. Detailed instructions for the conduct 
and interpretation of the CMR will be available  in a separate document, including the parameters 
to be analyzed .

Primary Outcome:  The primary outcome for this study will be t he combined number  
and incidence rate of se veral  arrhythmias of interest that occur in 
each group over a 14 day period post -study drug .  
These arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation, sustained  
ventricular tachycardia  (≥125 BPM, ≥ 30 seconds), non-sustained 
ventricular tachycardia (≥ 125 BPM, ≥ 16 beats, < 30 seconds) and 
high degree AV block ( 2nd or 3rd degree, ≥ 8 beats) were chosen 
because they are significant prognostic indicators of depressed left 
ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac death [1].  
The combined number of arrhythmic events in each group will be 
calculated along with the arrhythmia incidence rate defined as the 
percentage of patients in each group experiencing at least one of 
the defined arrhythmias of interest.  
An exploratory sub -analysis will be conducted to determine the 
number and incidence rate of each separ ate arrhythmia type per 
dose group.  
Continuous ECG monitoring will occur from post reperfusion until 
14 days post study drug by means of wearable ECG recorders.  
These will be positioned and activated as soon as feasible after 
treatment with study drug  is complete.  
Blinded , standardized central ized interpretation  will be used for 
analysis of arrhythmias  recorded with the wearable device . 
Descriptions of peri -procedural arrhythmias such as reperfusion 
arrhythmias or VF episodes occurring prior to application  of the 
wearable cardiac monitor will be categorized and documented 
separately on the CRF, with particular emphasis on persistent 
arrhythmias.  
Secondary Outcomes:   Infarct size parameters will be assessed by CMR at 72 +/ -
24 hours  and at 3 months; the following will be compared 
between groups; i nfarct size as a propor tion of ventricular 
volume  (INF/VV) , myocardial salvage index (MSI) and 
absolute MI size  
 The p roportion of patients with ST -segment resolution at 4 
hours post study drug  
 Serum levels of tr oponin calculated as AUC  0-48 hours 
post-study drug

13.1 Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, or clinical 
investigation subject administered an investigational product (pharmaceutical) and which does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding),  symptom, or 
disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the investigational product. A relationship to the investigational product is not 
necessarily proven or implied.  
All adverse event s occurring after a dose of investigational product observed by the investigator 
or reported by the subject (whether or not attributed to investigational product), will be reported 
on the case report form.  
Given that this study specifically recruits STEMI  patients, the MI itself will not be 
characterized as an AE.  
However, complications arising as a consequence of the MI, for example emergent or 
worsening heart failure, death, or  known  arrhythmias will be specifically documented as 
adverse events in the CR Fs.  
Adverse events will be followed until resolved or considered stable  out to 3 months . The only 
serious adverse event that will be tracked longer than 3 months is the i ncidence of death. All -
cause mortality and cardiac -related mortality will be document ed by phone call to the patient at 6 
months.  If the patient is unavailable, then mortality status will be obtained through 
physician/investigator records. The following attributes must be assigned by the investigator:  
description; dates of onset and reso lution; severity; assessment of relatedness to investigational 
product, other suspect drugs, and action taken.  The investigator may be asked to provide follow -
up information.   
13.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The principal investigator ( PI) will classify every AE according to its relationship to study drug 
or trial -related procedures. The categories according to World Health Organization guidelines are 
listed in Table 3 . 
 
Table 3: Relationship of AE to Study Drug or Trial -Related Procedures  
Rating  Classification  Definition  
1 Probable  An AE that:  
• Occurs at a reasonable time interval after administration of the 
Faraday Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,   
FDY -5301  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 46 of 61 study drug;  
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug and;  
• Cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics 
of the patient’s  clinical state or by other therapies  
2 Possible  An AE that:  
• Occurs at a reasonable time interval after administration of the 
study drug;  
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but;  
• Could have been produced by  the patient’s clinical state or by 
other therapies  
3 Unlikely  • An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate that 
the etiology is unrelated to the study drug;  
• Another etiology is specified  
If the AE is classified as unlikely, the PI should provide a likely cause, other illness, concomitant 
medication, or other.  
13.3 Intensity of Adverse Events  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study. The assessment will be based on the investigator’s cli nical judgment. The intensity of each 
AE and SAE recorded in the CRF should be assigned to one of the following categories:  
Mild:  An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities.  
Severe:  An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
13.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined as a significant hazard or side effect, regardless of the 
investigator or sponsor’s opinion on th e relationship to investigational product.  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  (NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" 
refers to an event/reaction in w hich the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event/reaction; it does not refer to an event/ reaction which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Faraday Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,   
FDY -5301  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 47 of 61 • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event or reaction  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening 
or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These 
should also usually be considered ser ious. Examples of such medical events include cancer, 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in hospitalizations, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Serious clinical laboratory abnormalities directly associated with relevant clinical signs or 
symptoms should also be reported.  
All SAEs occurring on study must be reported to the medical monitor within 24 hours of 
occurrence. These include SAEs within 30 days of the last investigational product dose and up to 
the last formal follow -up observational period, whichever period is longer.  
The investigator should notify the Institutional  Review Board ( IRB) of SAEs occurring at the site 
in accordance with local procedures, generally within 72 hours after knowledge of the SAE.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify the appropriate regulatory authorities about the 
safety of any tes t drug. Accordingly, prompt notification of any adverse events by investigators 
to the sponsor is required. The reporting of SAEs will be conducted in accordance with 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local 
regulatory guidelines.  
The initial notification will include at least a description of the event, and the subject 
identification. This information should be supported as needed with written copies of hospital 
case reports, autopsy reports, and other document s when applicable on the SAE CRF or the site’s 
standard SAE form.  
All adverse events reported in this study will be coded using MedDRA. Treatment -emergent 
adverse events will be listed and summarized per treatment.

14.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2A, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Multi -Center Study of 
Intravenous FDY -5301 in Acute Myocardial Infarction  
14.1.1  General Approach/Considerations  
Missing observations will be excluded from the analyses; they will not be substituted by 
estimated va lues. 
Demographics will be tabulated and summarized by descriptive statistics (mean, median, 
standard deviation, range) for continuous data and frequency tables for discrete data. Physical 
examination data from baseline and post -study and medical history d ata at baseline will be listed. 
All clinical safety and tolerability data will be listed for each subject. Hematology and clinical 
chemistry will be analyzed by group mean and outlier analyses.  Laboratory values outside the 
laboratory’s reference ranges a nd associated repeat values together with comments as to their 
clinical significance will be listed separately. Adverse event data will be summarized by group, 
visit, severity, and relationship to the study drug.  
All adverse events reported in this study w ill be coded using MedDRA 1 9.1  
Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be  calculat ed for blood iodide levels.  
14.1.2  Populations  
The safety population includes all subjects who were randomized and received any amount of 
study drug. Subjects who did not receive any study medication will not be included in the safety 
population.  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include subjects who gave informed consent and were 
randomized. This is the “full analysis set” of subjects.  Subjects are included in the ITT 
population according to the treatment assigned.  
The per protocol population will be a subset of the ITT population and will include subjects who 
gave informed consent, were randomized, received any amount of study drug, underwent PCI, 
and underwent an MRI at 72 +/ -24 hours  and 3 months . 
14.1.3  Study Outcomes  
The primary outcome for this study will be t he combined number  and incidence rate of se veral  
arrhythmias of interest that occur in each group over a 14 day period post -study drug . These 
arrhythmias including vent ricular fibrillation, sustained  ventricular tachycardia  (≥125 BPM, ≥ 30 
seconds), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (≥ 125 BPM, ≥ 16 beats, < 30 seconds) and high 
degree AV block ( 2nd or 3rd degree, ≥ 8 beats) were chosen because they are significant 
Faraday Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,   
FDY -5301  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 49 of 61 prognostic indicators of depressed left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac death [ 1]. The 
combined number of arrhythmic events in each group will be calculated along with the 
arrhythmia incidence rate defined as the percentage of patients in each gr oup experiencing at 
least one of the defined arrhythmias of interest.  
An exploratory sub -analysis will be conducted to determine the number and incidence rate of 
each separate arrhythmia type per dose group.  
Secondary exploratory e fficacy outcomes will include : 
Infarct size as a proportion of ventricular volume ( INF/VV), the myocardial salvage index 
(MSI) , absolute MI size ( INF) at 72 +/ - 24 hours and 3 months post study drug measured by 
CMR.  
The p roportion of patients with ST -segment resolution at 4 hou rs post study drug . 
Serum levels of troponin calculated as AUC  0-48 hours post study drug.  
Cardiac -related adverse events including the development of heart failure.   
The i ncidence of all-cause and cardiac mortality out to 6 months post PCI.  
In addition to the measurement of safety and efficacy parameters in this study, serum biomarker 
levels of cardiac injury, inflammation and remodeling will also be assessed.  
14.1.4  Sample Size Estimation  
Little data exists on the incidence of arrhythmias that occ ur over an extended period of time 
following AMI and monitoring strategies for this type of assessment have not been optimized in 
a clinical trial setting. The primary goal of our study is to characterize the occurrence  of 
arrhythmias in this patient popul ation for 14 days post -AMI and to determine the feasibility of 
using ambulatory patch ECG monitors to capture this data.  These data should be regarded as 
exploratory with the objective of identifying a meaningful clinical end point that can be easily 
meas ured in future, pivotal studies that are adequately powered to detect differences across 
treatment groups.     
Estimating a drop -out rate of approximately 5 0%, we will need to enroll up to 1 60 patients in 
order to obtain a final total  sample size of 80 pat ients . A final sample size of 80 patients will 
provide  80% power to detect a 37% reduction  in INF/VV assuming an SD of 10%, a 24% 
increase in MSI assuming an SD of 20% and a 39% reduction in Troponin AUC with an SD of 
60%. Equal variance was assumed among groups with an unbalanced allocation of patients to 
placebo (n=20) and combined FDY -5301 treatment groups (n=60).  
14.1.5  Interim and Final Analyses  
After the 14 day follow up visit to the clinic, all subjects’ data will be collected and analyzed for:

Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 50 of 61 • Safety (14 -day arrhythmias)  
• Early efficacy outcomes including MSI, INF/VV, INF  
• Serum troponin AUC 0 -48 hours post study drug  
• ST-segment resolution by 4 hours post -study drug  
• Cardiac function including EDV, ESV, FS and EF  
After the 3 month follow up visit, analysis of  the following will occur:  
• Early efficacy outcomes including MSI, INF/VV, INF  
• Cardiac function including EDV, ESV, FS and EF  
All remaining assessments will be analyzed at the conclusion of the study.  
14.1.6  General Analysis of Safety and Efficacy Outcomes  
Analysis of the primary safety outcome: characterize the number and incidence  rate of serious 
arrhythmias that occur during a 14 -day interval in this patient population.  No hypothesis will be 
tested and data will be descriptive in nature only.  A more det ailed analysis strategy will be 
outlined in the SAP.  
Analysis of exploratory secondary efficacy outcomes:  For  all variables with a continuous 
outcome including infarct size relative to the VV, MSI, absolute MI size, cardiac function, 
biomarkers of cardiac injury and cardiac troponin levels , a single pairwise comparison to analyze 
difference s between all three FDY -5301 groups (combined) and placebo  will be used . An 
unpaired Student’s T test will be used for the pairwise comparison if th e data are normally 
distributed and a Mann -Whitney rank test will be used for nonparametric data. Each group will 
then be tested using a one -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to obtain a common variance 
followed by  a Dunnett’s post -test to separately compar e each FDY -5301 dose group to placebo.  
For categorical outcome including ST-segment resolution and incidence of all-cause and cardiac 
related mortality or morbidity , odds ratios comparing each FDY -5301 treatment group with 
placebo will be calculated .  
Phys ical examination  data from baseline , post-study and medical history  data at baseline and 
peri-procedural arrhythmia data will be listed  by patient . All clinical safety and tolerability data 
will be listed for each subject. Laboratory values  will be calcula ted as group mean data and 
presented in shift tables. Comments as to the clinical significance of out of range values will be 
listed separately. Adverse event  data will be summarized by group, visit, severity, and possible 
relationship to the study drug.  
14.1.7  Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis  
The concentration of iodide in blood (at different time points and doses) will be summarized for 
each group. The pharmacokinetic analysis will include collections of a concentration -time profile 
in subjects following dosing wit h study drug. Mean, standard deviation (SD) and CV will be 
calculated at each time point. The pharmacokinetic behavior of blood iodide will be described as

The Investigator must ensure that all trial -related site source data, study -related documents and 
reports will be available, and that the provision of direct access for monitoring and auditing by 
Faraday  or its designees will be permitted. In addition, the  Investigator must ensure that all trial -
related site source data, study -related documents, and reports will be made available for 
inspection by the appropriate Regulatory Authority and review by the IRB/EC/IEC.  
The Investigator is responsible for notifyin g Faraday  in advance of an impending regulatory 
inspection. He/she may request that Faraday  provide support for preparation, if necessary, and is 
required to provide updates on the ongoing activities during the inspection and submit any 
citations/objection able findings (i.e., FDA 483) and is required to share any follow up responses 
to the outcome.  
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross -check of the 
eCRFs against the Investigator’s records by the Study Monitor (sourc e document verification). 
The Monitor will also review the Investigator’s drug accountability records to ensure that the 
drug supplies are stored and dispensed appropriately. A comprehensive validation program will 
verify the data and queries will be gener ated for resolution by the Investigator. Throughout the 
study, Faraday  or its  designates may review data as deemed necessary.

A written informed consent in compliance with Part 50 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), wit h the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH guidelines, federal and/or local 
regulations, and advance approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee 
(EC)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) shall be obtained from each subject or a legally 
authoriz ed representative of the subject prior to entering the study or performing any unusual or 
non-routine procedure that involves risk to the subject, including washout of any medications.  
The decision of whether to obtain written consent directly from the subject will be determined by 
the investigator.  If, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is not in a state to fully provide 
written consent, the investigator will obtain writt en consent from a legally authorized 
representative of the subject.  
Before enrollment, each prospective subject or legally authorized representative of the subject 
will be given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the approved informed 
consent form. Once the Principal Investigator or authorized designee is assured that the subject 
or legally authorized representative of the subject understands the implications of participating in 
the study, the subject or legally authorized representative  of the subject will be asked to give 
consent to participate in the study by signing the informed consent form.  
 If study informed consent was given by the subject’s legally authorized representative prior to 
study enrollment, the subject will be provided with a modified consent once they are stable (after 
investigational drug treatment and STEMI procedure) and in the opinion of the investigator 
capable of providing written consent.  This modified informed consent document will cover the 
subject’s agreement  to remain in the clinical trial and proceed with all study related procedures 
and follow -up. 
 
The consent form s must be dated and retained by the Investigator  as part of the clinical trial  
records. The Investigator  will not undertake any investigation spe cifically required for the 
clinical trial until valid consent has been obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was 
obtained must also be documented in the CRF.  Each subject will receive a fully -signed copy of 
each consent form that he/she signs for the clinical trial  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for maintaining the originally signed ICF document  
according to record retention requirements.  
If any institution -specific modifications to study -related procedures are proposed or made by the 
site, the consent should be reviewed by the Sponsor and/or its designee, if appropriate, prior to 
IRB/IEC submission. Once reviewed, the consent will be submitted by the Principal Investigator 
or authorized designee to his or her IRB/IEC for review and appro val prior to the start of the 
study. If the informed consent form is revised during the course of the study, all actively 
Faraday Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,

Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 57 of 61 participating subjects must sign the revised form, unless otherwise indicated, i.e. administrative 
changes.  
 
If subject or subject’s partner , becomes pregnant during their participation in the trial, a separate 
pregnancy  informed consent form will be obtained , to follow the pregnancy, any complications, 
and the health of the baby.  The pregnancy consent should  be obtained at the time th e 
investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy.

The Principal Investigator or designee must document and explain in the subject’s source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. A deviation from the protocol is an 
unintend ed and/or unanticipated departure from the procedures and/or processes approved by the 
Sponsor and the IRB/IEC and agreed to by the Principal Investigator. Protocol violations and 
deviations will be documented by the clinical monitor throughout the course of monitoring visits. 
Principal Investigator will be notified of violations and/or deviations in writing by the monitor. 
The IRB/IEC should be notified of all protocol violations and deviations according to IRB/IEC 
reporting requirements.

19.1 Reporting and Recording of Data  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to record essential information in the medical records in 
accordance with local regulations and requirements. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring 
the accu racy, completeness, legibility and timelines of the data recorded in the eCRF.  
The Principal Investigator agrees to maintain accurate source do cumentation as part of the case 
histories and to accurately enter this information on to the electronic Case Report Forms 
(eCRFs). These source documents are distinct from the eCRFs and are designed to record all 
observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each subject .  
The eCRFs will be reviewed and the source documents verified by the study  monitor during 
routine monitoring visits, in accordance with the Clinical Monitoring Plan, to ensure that data in 
the eCRFs are accurate and complete.  
19.2 Retention of Records  
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement 
with Faraday .  
Faraday  will notify the Investigator/institution when the study records are no longer needed.  
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records must be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator, IRB). Not ice of such 
transfer will  be given in writing to Faraday .  
The Investigator must inform Faraday immediately if any documents are lost, to be transferred to 
another facility, or to be transferred to a different owner.  
The I nvestigator must contact Faraday  prior to destroying any records associated with the study.  
19.3 Confidentiality and Publications  
All clinical trial  findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator  and 
members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written 
approval from the Sponsor.  
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be identified on CRFs 
and other documents by their subject number, initials and/or birth date, not by name  and subject 
in accordance with local requirements . Documents not to be submitted that identify the subject 
(e.g., the signed informed consent) must be maintained in confidence by the Investigator .

Confidential , FDY -5301 -201-US Page 60 of 61 Faraday is committed to the timely communication of data from clinical research tria ls, 
following the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America principles. Where 
possible, authorship will be agreed at the beginning of the study. The authors will form a 
publication committee and this committee will propose and develop appropriat e scientific 
manuscripts or abstracts from the study data. Investigators may not present or publish partial or 
complete study results individually. Any manuscript or abstract proposed by the Investigators 
must be reviewed and approved in writing by Faraday  before submission for publication. Names 
of all Investigators participating in the study will be included in the publication. The publication 
committee for a study will comprise of authors selected in adherence with the International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria for authorship. That is, all authors must meet each 
of the following 3 criteria:  
 Substantial contribution to conception and design or acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data  
 Drafted the article or revised it cri tically for important intellectual content  
 Approved the final version for publication  
Members of the study steering committee generally fulfill the authorship criteria through their 
involvement in protocol design and review, monitoring of and sometimes dir ect involvement 
with recruitment, and thus they will usually be part of the publication committee. If studies are 
multicenter, it may be appropriate to assign group authorship.  
In addition, certain Faraday employees involved in the design and conception of  the protocol, 
study management and data analysis and interpretation are qualified authors and will be included 
in the publication committee e.g., the lead physician, statistician and study project manager or 
their equivalents.

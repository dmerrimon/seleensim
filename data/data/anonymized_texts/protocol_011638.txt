3.0 PROTOCOL  ABSTRACT
The primary  purpose of this study is to determine whether creative writing in newly diagnosed cancer 
patients and those with recent progression in their disease will have a positive impact on their mental 
health. Using a randomized controlled trial approach, emotion thermometers will be employed to 
evaluate participants’ responses on a number of domains, such as anxiety, depression, despair, and 
anger along with a series of survey questions to monitor changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms. 
Open-ended survey questions will be used to capture how a creative writing intervention impacts 
participants’ experience of their illness. Melissa Greene’s Write from the Heart program focuses more 
on creative writing rather than cancer focused topics. Patients in the intervention arm will complete –
one and a half hour group sessions every two weeks over the span of 3 months. Participants in the 
active control arm will be provided a book (i.e., Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) about 
creative writing and will be asked to do activities for 1.5 hrs every 2 weeks for a period of 2-3 months.
4.0 OBJECTIVES
4.1 Primary  Objectives:  
Mental  wellness before and after intervention in the intervention and control groups. A 
validated Emotional Thermometer Scales will be used to predict changes in parameters 
reflecting participants’ mental health pre- and post-intervention. Survey questions 
focused on symptoms of depression and anxiety will be used to monitor for changes in 
mental wellness pre- and post-intervention. 
4.2 Secondary  Objectives : 
Comparison  of mood scores, depression and anxiety symptoms versus frequency of 
attendance in the intervention arm. 
Comparison  of somatic symptom burden between intervention and control group.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms after workshop between genders. 
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms between patients living alone versus with family.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms between various cancer types.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms in individuals who have previously attended a creative writing class versus 
those who have not. 
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms in individuals who completed control group activity and then enrolled in the 
workshops and attended at least one session. 
Comparison  of the frequency of emergency room visits and hospitalizations between 
intervention and control group during the study period.

5.0 BACKGROUND
5.1 Scientific  Background and Gaps 
Cancer is  a life-threatening, feared diagnosis and is a source of great distress in patients.  Hence in 
addition to treating cancer, one must address the emotional well-being of patients. 
Creative activity  has a significant history in providing a wide range of psychological and 
physiological benefits for cancer survivors (King et al., 2012). When individuals experience a stressful 
life event or crisis, the higher verbal functions in the cerebral cortex become less accessible (Hass-
Cohen, 2008.) Therefore, patients who face such stressful life events of cancer are often left without 
words to describe their experiences of feelings (Green & Young, 2015). Findings from Green and 
Young (2015) suggest that creative visual expression, engaging both in an individual and the 
therapeutic setting, offered an opportunity for young adult survivors to express their emotions from 
deep within their bodies. It created self-understanding and a sense of healing. 
In another study  by Bolton (2007) patients indicated that they found the therapeutic writing process 
beneficial. For example, one participant narrated, “It made it less traumatic than it might have been 
otherwise.” Creative writing has been recognized to explore and express personal thoughts, feelings, 
and experiences. Lau Tsu (1973) showed that writing facilitated patients’ ability to discover what they 
thought felt and remembered. Therapeutic creative writing enhanced their awareness of and ability to 
express issues to which attention and focus are required. (Esterhing BA et al., 1999)
There is  a substantial area of agreement that language, narrative storytelling, forms an essential 
element in the construction of a coherent identity, sense of self and connectedness to others, and 
therefore, it is a powerful tool in creative therapy (Smyth, 1998; Wright & Chung, 2001). Roe and 
Davidson (2005) argue that processes of re-authoring one’s life story are actually integral components 
of the recovery process itself. A study by Stanton (2002) of breast cancer patients prompted to write 
about their cancer experience showed a significant decrease in self-reported somatic symptoms and 
medical appointment visits for cancer-related morbidities three months after participation in the study. A 
follow-up study by Stanton (2013) encouraged breast cancer patients to create personal websites to 
chronicle their experience and to communicate with their social network. This study showed significant 
improvement in positive mood and depressive symptoms after 6 months, particularly in patients 
undergoing medical therapy at that time.  These studies further support that the act of narrative story 
telling can improve patient wellbeing. 
Furthermore, King  et al. (2012) suggest that writing can contribute to repair of symbolic functioning 
and contribute to the development of personal identity. The researchers concluded that, of all the 
creative arts, writing is least dependent on equipment and/or special environments. Writing workshops 
are probably better provided by professional writers than by mental health professionals. When health 
professionals provide activities such as a writing workshop, there is a risk that identification with the 
illness is reinforced. On the other hand, when a professional writer provides a similar activity, it is the 
participant’s identity as a writer that is reinforced, rather than their identity as a person with an illness. 
(King et al., 2012)
Moreover, there  is emerging consensus in the UK and USA that there might be advantages if 
writing therapy is received from facilitators who themselves are trained writers and can work in 
collaboration with health care professionals. (Hunt & Sampson, 1998; Mc Loughlin, 2004).

 Institutional  Review Board
page 6  of 69 IRB APPLICATION    5.2   Previous Data  
We conducted  a pilot study to determine feasibility whether cancer patients can be enrolled, 
randomized and retained for four weeks for creative writing classes (Feasibility was defined as 50% of 
our enrolled patients on intervention arm (IA) could attend at least 2 classes). We anticipated enrolling 
45 patients over the period of 2 months with randomization into 2 arms: IA and standard of care (SOC). 
“Write from the Heart” a series of creative writing workshops (CWW) were conducted on IA. Subjects in 
IA had four, 2-hour weekly CWW whereas SOC arm did not receive any session. We used validated 
Emotional Thermometer Scales (ETS), ranging 0 (best)-10 (worst), to predict changes in a number of 
parameters reflecting patient’s mental health pre and post intervention. ETS has five dimensions 
(distress, anxiety, depression, anger and need help), which are all continuous variables.  Due to time 
constraints we were not able to accrue the desired number of patients. A total of 16 patients were 
accrued in 1 month period -11 in IA and 5 in SOC. 7 out of 11 (63%) patients enrolled in IA attended at 
least 75%  of classes. Comparisons were made using two-sample T-tests. Although sample size was 
small, IA  did show a decreasing pattern on Total Emotion Score (TES), particularly in depression and 
anxiety scores  (See table 1 and figure 1, 2). For each visit, post-class scores were lower than pre-class 
scores. We  observed that it is feasible for cancer patients to attend focused workshops geared towards 
mental health wellbeing. IA showed a trend towards mood improvement, although was not shown to be 
statistically significant which may be attributed to the small sample size. Having shown the feasibility of 
such a study, we hope to increase the sample size and include more specific methods for quantifying 
mood improvement in the patient groups. In addition, after reviewing the suggestions (post completion 
of the study) from the patients who attended these sessions on the study, we concluded that 1.5hours 
of class twice a month is feasible and helpful for patients.

6.0 RATIONALE  AND HYPOTHESIS
6.1 RATIONALE:
Cancer generates an  increased sense of distress than non-malignant diseases with poor 
prognoses (Mishel et al., 1984). Persistent mental distress for prolonged periods leads to anxiety and 
depression. The rate of depression in cancer patients is thought to be up to three times higher than in 
the general population (Linden et al., 2012). Depression leads to a poorer quality of life (QOL) and 
affects patient outcomes, with depression resulting in higher rates of mortality in cancer (Colleoni et al., 
2000, Pinquart et al., 2010). A meta-analysis revealed that minor or major depression increases 
mortality rates by up to 39%, and that patients displaying even few depressive symptoms may be at a 
25% increased risk of mortality (Satin et al., 2009). The impact of mood and mental wellbeing on cancer 
progression is considered important by doctors and patients, with >70% of oncologists and 85% of 
patients believing that mood affects the progression of cancer (Lemon et al., 2004). Our previous data 
as mentioned before shows that creative writing is feasible and needs to be further studied to 
understand the effect of group therapy with focused workshop in newly diagnosed or patients with 
recent recurrence. In addition, we observed that the emotional thermometer scale was not enough to 
capture the mood of the patients. For example, some patients felt significantly better after attending 
these sessions and were able to cope with their symptoms but the emotional scale did not reflect that 
benefit. 
6.2 HYPOTHESIS:
This study aims  to look at the impact of participating in creative writing workshop group Write 
from the Heart, on cancer patients’ emotional well-being. Keeping previous studies in mind, a 
STUDY00008646
Approval: 1/24/2020

page 8  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  professional writer  will conduct the workshops, which will enhance the participant’s ability to express 
and enhance their awareness. We anticipate that participation in the workshop will result in a positive 
effect on the parameters being studied, enabling patients to cope with their illness/cancer better.  We 
hypothesize that group sessions of creative writing workshop could be better than individual sessions.

  9.1 Phase
Phase II
9.2 Design
The focus  of this study is to determine the difference in mental health parameters following the 
participation of cancer patients in a creative writing workshop. Participants will be randomized 
within strata formed by cancer type in order to assure that these potentially important 
confounding variables are balanced across groups. Patients will be enrolled on a rolling basis 
over a four to five-month period, allowing patients in intervention arm to participate in 2-3 
months workshops (workshops would be held once every 2 weeks). Patients in control arm will 
be provided a book (Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) about creative writing and will be 
asked to do activities for 1.5 hours every 2 weeks. After three months, control group participants 
can join creative writing workshops at their discretion for the remaining period for writing 
workshops. Both group members will receive follow up surveys twice a month for two months at 
the completion of the participant’s two-month study period.  
9.3 Study  Duration 
Estimated time  to enroll all subjects = 3-5 months (Patients will start being enrolled after IRB 
approval and  we will continue the enrollment up to 4-5 months from the time the 1st class starts 
 for  the intervention group)
Length of  a participant's participation = 2 - 6 months; Follow up after participant’s completion of 
classes =  2 months

10.0 STUDY  PROCEDURES
10.1 Methods:    After enrollment as above, co-investigators of this study or the assigned 
coordinator will be doing the consent. Patient will be randomized to intervention and control 
arms in a 2:1 ratio. The intervention arm will receive a dedicated workshop for one and a half 
hours every 2 weeks.  We aim to start a 6 month long program with weekly creative writings 
workshops, and patient enrollment in the study will continue through the 1st 4.5 months of the 6 
month period so that the last enrolled patient could complete 2 classes per month for two 
months. Each patient will be asked to attend at least two classes per month for a total of two 
months. These workshops will be held at Hershey Medical Center (HMC). At the initiation of the 
study along with consent we will collect baseline scores in both groups for each parameter as 
below. Somatic Symptom Burden (SSM-8 - Figure 2 - reference section), depression symptoms 
using PHQ-9 (Figure 3 – reference section), and anxiety symptoms using GAD-7 (Figure 4 –
reference section) will be collected monthly and following intervention completion. 
We will  collect mood scores pre and post each session. We will use Emotional Thermometer 
Scale (EMS) from Dr. Alex J. Mitchell (Feb. 2010), diagram for scales is shown in figure 1. 
Please see supplementary index for a letter of permission to use from Dr. Mitchell. We will give 
the Thermometer scales and collect scores pre and post each session and also collect scores 
pre and post completion of entire course. Control group will do EMS on monthly basis along with 
other parameters. At the end of the study we will review all participants’ medical charts to count 
view the number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations each participant experienced 
during the study period. These will be further broken down in categories based on cancer 
STUDY00008646

page 12  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  related vs  non-cancer related visits.  We will also review their most current cancer disease 
status after completion of the workshops and categorize whether their status is considered to be 
stable, progressing, or in remission. Both groups will also receive follow up mood and symptom 
surveys twice a month for up to 2 months after completion of the participant’s two to three 
month study period. 
The control  arm will receive a book (i.e., Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) on creative 
writing and asked to read and do writing activities for one and a half hours once every two 
weeks. At the completion of the two-month participation or completion of 4 sessions control 
patients will be given the opportunity to enroll in the creative writing workshops for the 
remainder of the study period of 6 months. We will collect scores from control arm through the 
same Emotion Thermometers Scale on a monthly basis. Pre-intervention scores will be 
obtained at the time of consent or one week prior to the planned start of session 1 for workshop 
(either in the clinic if possible or mail the score sheet to patients with an enclosed stamped 
envelope for return of the scales). Depending on participant preference, we can send them 
emails of the REDCAP surveys containing the same information at set intervals. A sample of the 
REDCAP surveys is included in supplementary materials. We will also send participants in the 
control arm a stamped return envelope on a monthly basis if not able to get score sheets in a 
clinic or over REDCAP, depending on patient convenience and preference. We will call the 
participants once every 3-4 weeks to check in on their progress. Please see a calendar at the 
end for details. 
To assess  for possible confounding results of patients participating in the concurrent exercise 
study, we will ask participants if they are also enrolled in the exercise study at enrollment and 
perform a subset analysis for patients who are in the exercise study. They will be randomized 
into either control or intervention group in the same manner as the other patients in the study. 
We will additionally include a section of the survey to ask about regular exercise (more than 30 
minutes, three times a week) and do a subset analysis of these patients as well.   
 
We will  be collaborating with the Department of psychiatry at HMC - Dr. Aditya Joshi, Dr. 
Michael Hayes, and Dr. Erika Saunders. Any subject who requests psychiatry follow up will be 
referred to Dr. Michael Hayes.  If participants report the presence of suicidal ideation per 
question nine on the PHQ-9 [i.e., Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting 
yourself in some way], they will be referred on an urgent basis to Dr. Michael Hayes or Dr. 
Aditya Joshi. In the event Dr. Hayes and/or Dr. Joshi are unavailable for follow-up,  If any active 
suicidal thoughts are reported, participants will be referred directly to Emergency Department at 
Hershey Medical Center. 
10.2 Clinical  Covariates:  Detailed clinical covariates will be obtained from questionnaires and 
medical record review including demographics (age, gender, race), cancer type and stage, 
psychiatric history, chemotherapy regimen and medication use.  
10.3 Creative  Workshop: Write from Heart: This workshop for cancer patients usually lasts one 
and a half hours and is broken into several parts. Usually beginning with inspirational quotes or 
passages from writings of  respected authors, to shift mood and illuminated deeper thought and 
reflection. The next phase of the class consists of sharing a beautiful or whimsical object 
handed person to person or placed in the middle of the table to stimulate both curiosity and the 
senses. When participants are able to relax fully, in tranquil and focused surroundings the 
imagination easily transforms a bright polished stone or a glass heart with inner fractures into a 
metaphorical image. The technique of journaling is also encouraged in class, as a way to

comfort and consolation, when not in class. Within our setting, it is normal, though not 
mandatory that writing may lean toward the cancer experience. At the end of each series,

the page. 
10.4     Emotional  Thermometers Scale: The Emotion Thermometers tool is a simple rapid modular 
screening tool  for detection and monitoring of emotional disorders in clinical practice. It was 
created by  Dr. Alex J Mitchell and has a simple visual-analogue design. It is easy for most 
patients (including  older people) to understand, quick to administer and simple to score. We 
have already  got permission from Dr. Alex J Mitchell for royalty free usage of this scale for 2 
years starting  from Aug, 2016 till Aug 2018. We will be getting permission from him to extend 
the usage  for an additional 1-2 years. 
10.5    Survey  of Depression and Anxiety symptoms: For anxiety, we will use Generalized Anxiety  
Disorder 7-item  (GAD-7) validated scale by Robert Spitzer et al. For depression we will use 
Patient Health  Questionnaire 9–item (PHQ-9) validated scale by Robert Spitzer et al.  Both of 
these scales  do not require any permission for reproduction, display, distribution or usage. 
10.6 Control group activities:  Participants randomized into the control group were asked to 
maintain their usual follow up while also reading a book on creative writing for one and a half 
hours every other week for three months, logging their activity for verification of task completion.  
Their mode scores will be measured as mentioned above.
11.0 Statistical  Plan
11.1 Statistical  Analysis Plan
Participants’ basic  demographic and baseline clinical measurements will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Those summarizations will be based on all patients as well as on patients 
within each group. This study has several main groups of outcome variables, which reflect several 
different domains of patient’s mental health. The first group is the emotion thermometer (which has 
five sub-scales), the second is the somatic symptom scale (SSS-8), the third is the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the fourth is the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7), 
which measures participants’ anxiety. All the above outcome variable groups are based on 
questionnaires using Likert-scale questions to take the measurements, and each group may 
involve multiple sub-dimensions. Both the intervention group and the control group have repeated 
measures of the outcomes as shown in Figure 1. Graphical methods (such as the line plot of 
mean/SD values vs. time) will first be used to illustrate the mean and standard deviation values of 
the mode, depression, and anxiety scores through the time for both groups. These methods will 
help us detect the patterns of how the scores change over time (within-group change) and how the 
scores differ between groups. We will further use the linear mixed-effect model for repeated 
measures to analyze the within-group and between-group differences. Every sub-dimension will be 
analyzed individually, but we will also analyze the composite score for the dimensions. For the 
patients in the control group this study involves two stages (week 1-12 and week 13-20), and at the 
end of the 12th week, they can join the intervention group. This setting will allow us to study the 
effect of the intervention on the control group alone. For this part of analyses, linear mixed-effect 
models will be set up with the stage serves as an indicator variable in the model. The comparison 
of outcome variables between certain time points will also be done using paired tests. We will 
further investigate the possible factors that might affect the change of outcome variables over time. 
The factors are gender, race, marital status, time from cancer diagnosis (first 3 months, 3-6 
months, more than 6 months) and cancer stages. This part of analyses will mainly be focused on 
the intervention group and the above factors will be examined in the linear mixed-effect models. All 
analyses will be performed using statistical software SAS version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC, USA) and the statistical significance level to be used is 0.05.

page 14  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  11.2 Sample  size considerations:
We plan  to enroll a total of 60 participants in the study – with 40 participants in the intervention 
group and 20 participants in the control group (2:1 ratio). This sample size is mainly determined by 
the capacity of the workshop. With this sample size we are able to detect a standard effect size 
(the mean difference measured in common standard deviation) of 0.45 with at least 80% statistical 
power (using two-sample repeated measure ANOVA model, assuming four time-points, and the 
within-patient auto-correlation being 0.2) . 
12.0 CONFIDENTIALITY
How will  confidentiality of data be maintained?  Check all that apply.
 Paper-based  records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel 
involved in the study.
 Use  of a code number to label all research data
 Use  of a study ID code linking list that will be maintained separate from the research data files 
on the HMC server (identifiers)
 Computer-based  files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through 
the use of access privileges and passwords.
 Prior  to access to any study-related information, personnel will be required to sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.
 Whenever  feasible, identifiers will be removed from study-related information.
 A  Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at 
risk of criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject’s financial standing, employability, 
or liability.
 A  waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the 
subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of 
confidentiality.  (This is not an option for FDA-regulated research.) 
 Precautions  are in place to ensure the data is secure by using passwords and encryption, 
because the research involves web-based surveys.  
 Audio  and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identification of subjects. 
 Other  (specify): All data entered and stored in RedCap database (the proxy PI has an active 
RedCap account) and will be used to transfer data in a deidentified format only.
12.1 Identifiers  associated with data and/or specimens
Identifiers like  dates and medical record numbers will be used.
12.2 Use  of Codes, Master List
Use of  a code linking list will be maintained separate from the research data files on the 
HMC server.  All data entered and stored in HIPAA compliant RedCap database (the 
proxy PI has an active RedCap account) and will be used to transfer data in a deidentified 
format only.
12.3 Storage  of Data 
All electronic files will  be encrypted and/or password protected-EXCEL database, stored 
on a hard drive in locked HMC offices. Paper files will be stored in locked HMC offices/labs of 
the research team. These will be deleted/ shredded/destroyed at the end of study approval 
period. Information will be kept confidential and private and managed according to HIPAA 
guidelines.
12.4 Access  to Data 
Research team consisting  of PI, Co-investigators, team participants, biostatisticians only 
will have access to the data
12.5 Transferring  Data

15.0 RISK/BENEFIT  ASSESSMENT
15.1 Potential Study  Risks
Minimal. It  is an intervention to determine changes in mood scales before and after creative 
writing workshop, and we anticipate minimal risk (breach of confidentiality – measures taken as above) for 
patients regarding their underlying cancer or treatment.
15.2 Potential Study  Benefits
Participants randomized to  the intervention with creative writing workshops may experience an 
improvement in their mood. We suspect that patients may have better adherence to their cancer therapy, but 
we do not expect any effect on cancer overall. 
  15.3 Alternatives to  Participation
Not participating.

Reporting Adverse  Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to the Responsible IRB
The only possible adverse event  or unanticipated problem is the loss of confidentiality, and as far as 
loss of confidentiality is concerned, in accordance with applicable policies of The Pennsylvania State 
University Institutional Review Board (IRB), the investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed or 
reported harm (adverse event) experienced by a subject or other individual, which in the opinion of the 
investigator is determined to be (1) unexpected; and (2) probably related to the research procedures. 
Harms (adverse events) will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the IRB policies and 
procedures.
20.0 STUDY  MONITORING, AUDITING AND INSPECTING
The investigator  will permit study-related monitoring, audits and inspections by the Penn State quality 
assurance program office(s), IRB, the sponsor, and government regulatory bodies, of all study related 
documents (e.g., source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities 
(e.g. workshop room etc.).

We wanted  to bring your attention to 1 protocol change we have completed that we describe below.
1.The  Enrollment Period has been extended from 3 months to 4-5 months after initiation of study 
Rational: Difficulty  with participant accrual. 
Our enrollment  period is based on the last day individuals can enroll and still complete the requested 
number of classes. Previously, for a 6-month class schedule with a request for 3 months of participation, 
we would enroll for three months. By changing the requested participation to 2 classes/month in two 
months as described by the previous amendment, we can extend the enrollment period by two additional 
weeks while still having individuals be able to complete the necessary number of classes.  
Detailed description  of changes
The following changes  have been made in the document “HRP-591 Protocol for Human Subjects 
Research – Study 00008646 Creative Writing Study – IRB – Amendment 1 protocol v3 tracked edits 
8.30” – you can see these same changes on the Tracked Changes version of the protocol as well:
1)Section  9.2 Design, first paragraph, sentence 3 
- changed three to “four-month period”
2)Section  9.5 Study Schema, Figure 1: 
- edited study schema to reflect enrollment for 4-5 months 
3)Section  10.1 Methods 
- Changed enrollment from 1st 3 months to 1st 4-5 months

3.0 PROTOCOL  ABSTRACT
The primary  purpose of this study is to determine whether creative writing in newly diagnosed cancer 
patients and those with recent progression in their disease will have a positive impact on their mental 
health. Using a randomized controlled trial approach, emotion thermometers will be employed to 
evaluate participants’ responses on a number of domains, such as anxiety, depression, despair, and 
anger along with a series of survey questions to monitor changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms. 
Open-ended survey questions will be used to capture how a creative writing intervention impacts 
participants’ experience of their illness. Melissa Greene’s Write from the Heart program focuses more 
on creative writing rather than cancer focused topics. Patients in the intervention arm will complete –
one and a half hour group sessions every two weeks over the span of 3 months. Participants in the 
active control arm will be provided a book (i.e., Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) about 
creative writing and will be asked to do activities for 1.5 hrs every 2 weeks for a period of 2-3 months.
4.0 OBJECTIVES
4.1 Primary  Objectives:  
Mental  wellness before and after intervention in the intervention and control groups. A 
validated Emotional Thermometer Scales will be used to predict changes in parameters 
reflecting participants’ mental health pre- and post-intervention. Survey questions 
focused on symptoms of depression and anxiety will be used to monitor for changes in 
mental wellness pre- and post-intervention. 
4.2 Secondary  Objectives : 
Comparison  of mood scores, depression and anxiety symptoms versus frequency of 
attendance in the intervention arm. 
Comparison  of somatic symptom burden between intervention and control group.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms after workshop between genders. 
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms between patients living alone versus with family.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms between various cancer types.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms in individuals who have previously attended a creative writing class versus 
those who have not. 
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms in individuals who completed control group activity and then enrolled in the 
workshops and attended at least one session. 
Comparison  of the frequency of emergency room visits and hospitalizations between 
intervention and control group during the study period.

5.0 BACKGROUND
5.1 Scientific  Background and Gaps 
Cancer is  a life-threatening, feared diagnosis and is a source of great distress in patients.  Hence in 
addition to treating cancer, one must address the emotional well-being of patients. 
Creative activity  has a significant history in providing a wide range of psychological and 
physiological benefits for cancer survivors (King et al., 2012). When individuals experience a stressful 
life event or crisis, the higher verbal functions in the cerebral cortex become less accessible (Hass-
Cohen, 2008.) Therefore, patients who face such stressful life events of cancer are often left without 
words to describe their experiences of feelings (Green & Young, 2015). Findings from Green and 
Young (2015) suggest that creative visual expression, engaging both in an individual and the 
therapeutic setting, offered an opportunity for young adult survivors to express their emotions from 
deep within their bodies. It created self-understanding and a sense of healing. 
In another study  by Bolton (2007) patients indicated that they found the therapeutic writing process 
beneficial. For example, one participant narrated, “It made it less traumatic than it might have been 
otherwise.” Creative writing has been recognized to explore and express personal thoughts, feelings, 
and experiences. Lau Tsu (1973) showed that writing facilitated patients’ ability to discover what they 
thought felt and remembered. Therapeutic creative writing enhanced their awareness of and ability to 
express issues to which attention and focus are required. (Esterhing BA et al., 1999)
There is  a substantial area of agreement that language, narrative storytelling, forms an essential 
element in the construction of a coherent identity, sense of self and connectedness to others, and 
therefore, it is a powerful tool in creative therapy (Smyth, 1998; Wright & Chung, 2001). Roe and 
Davidson (2005) argue that processes of re-authoring one’s life story are actually integral components 
of the recovery process itself. A study by Stanton (2002) of breast cancer patients prompted to write 
about their cancer experience showed a significant decrease in self-reported somatic symptoms and 
medical appointment visits for cancer-related morbidities three months after participation in the study. A 
follow-up study by Stanton (2013) encouraged breast cancer patients to create personal websites to 
chronicle their experience and to communicate with their social network. This study showed significant 
improvement in positive mood and depressive symptoms after 6 months, particularly in patients 
undergoing medical therapy at that time.  These studies further support that the act of narrative story 
telling can improve patient wellbeing. 
Furthermore, King  et al. (2012) suggest that writing can contribute to repair of symbolic functioning 
and contribute to the development of personal identity. The researchers concluded that, of all the 
creative arts, writing is least dependent on equipment and/or special environments. Writing workshops 
are probably better provided by professional writers than by mental health professionals. When health 
professionals provide activities such as a writing workshop, there is a risk that identification with the 
illness is reinforced. On the other hand, when a professional writer provides a similar activity, it is the 
participant’s identity as a writer that is reinforced, rather than their identity as a person with an illness. 
(King et al., 2012)
Moreover, there  is emerging consensus in the UK and USA that there might be advantages if 
writing therapy is received from facilitators who themselves are trained writers and can work in 
collaboration with health care professionals. (Hunt & Sampson, 1998; Mc Loughlin, 2004).

page 29  of 69 IRB APPLICATION    5.2   Previous Data  
We conducted  a pilot study to determine feasibility whether cancer patients can be enrolled, 
randomized and retained for four weeks for creative writing classes (Feasibility was defined as 50% of 
our enrolled patients on intervention arm (IA) could attend at least 2 classes). We anticipated enrolling 
45 patients over the period of 2 months with randomization into 2 arms: IA and standard of care (SOC). 
“Write from the Heart” a series of creative writing workshops (CWW) were conducted on IA. Subjects in 
IA had four, 2-hour weekly CWW whereas SOC arm did not receive any session. We used validated 
Emotional Thermometer Scales (ETS), ranging 0 (best)-10 (worst), to predict changes in a number of 
parameters reflecting patient’s mental health pre and post intervention. ETS has five dimensions 
(distress, anxiety, depression, anger and need help), which are all continuous variables.  Due to time 
constraints we were not able to accrue the desired number of patients. A total of 16 patients were 
accrued in 1 month period -11 in IA and 5 in SOC. 7 out of 11 (63%) patients enrolled in IA attended at 
least 75%  of classes. Comparisons were made using two-sample T-tests. Although sample size was 
small, IA  did show a decreasing pattern on Total Emotion Score (TES), particularly in depression and 
anxiety scores  (See table 1 and figure 1, 2). For each visit, post-class scores were lower than pre-class 
scores. We  observed that it is feasible for cancer patients to attend focused workshops geared towards 
mental health wellbeing. IA showed a trend towards mood improvement, although was not shown to be 
statistically significant which may be attributed to the small sample size. Having shown the feasibility of 
such a study, we hope to increase the sample size and include more specific methods for quantifying 
mood improvement in the patient groups. In addition, after reviewing the suggestions (post completion 
of the study) from the patients who attended these sessions on the study, we concluded that 1.5hours 
of class twice a month is feasible and helpful for patients.

6.0 RATIONALE  AND HYPOTHESIS
6.1 RATIONALE:
Cancer generates an  increased sense of distress than non-malignant diseases with poor 
prognoses (Mishel et al., 1984). Persistent mental distress for prolonged periods leads to anxiety and 
depression. The rate of depression in cancer patients is thought to be up to three times higher than in 
the general population (Linden et al., 2012). Depression leads to a poorer quality of life (QOL) and 
affects patient outcomes, with depression resulting in higher rates of mortality in cancer (Colleoni et al., 
2000, Pinquart et al., 2010). A meta-analysis revealed that minor or major depression increases 
mortality rates by up to 39%, and that patients displaying even few depressive symptoms may be at a 
25% increased risk of mortality (Satin et al., 2009). The impact of mood and mental wellbeing on cancer 
progression is considered important by doctors and patients, with >70% of oncologists and 85% of 
patients believing that mood affects the progression of cancer (Lemon et al., 2004). Our previous data 
as mentioned before shows that creative writing is feasible and needs to be further studied to 
understand the effect of group therapy with focused workshop in newly diagnosed or patients with 
recent recurrence. In addition, we observed that the emotional thermometer scale was not enough to 
capture the mood of the patients. For example, some patients felt significantly better after attending 
these sessions and were able to cope with their symptoms but the emotional scale did not reflect that 
benefit. 
6.2 HYPOTHESIS:
This study aims  to look at the impact of participating in creative writing workshop group Write 
from the Heart, on cancer patients’ emotional well-being. Keeping previous studies in mind, a 
STUDY00008646
Approval: 1/24/2020
 Institutional  Review Board
page 31  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  professional writer  will conduct the workshops, which will enhance the participant’s ability to express 
and enhance their awareness. We anticipate that participation in the workshop will result in a positive 
effect on the parameters being studied, enabling patients to cope with their illness/cancer better.  We 
hypothesize that group sessions of creative writing workshop could be better than individual sessions.

  9.1 Phase
Phase II
9.2 Design
The focus  of this study is to determine the difference in mental health parameters following the 
participation of cancer patients in a creative writing workshop. Participants will be randomized 
within strata formed by cancer type in order to assure that these potentially important 
confounding variables are balanced across groups. Patients will be enrolled on a rolling basis 
over a four to five-month period, allowing patients in intervention arm to participate in 2-3 
months workshops (workshops would be held once every 2 weeks). Patients in control arm will 
be provided a book (Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) about creative writing and will be 
asked to do activities for 1.5 hours every 2 weeks. After three months, control group participants 
can join creative writing workshops at their discretion for the remaining period for writing 
workshops. Both group members will receive follow up surveys twice a month for two months at 
the completion of the participant’s three-month study period.  
9.3 Study  Duration 
Estimated time  to enroll all subjects = 3-5 months (Patients will start being enrolled after IRB 
approval and  we will continue the enrollment up to 4-5 months from the time the 1st class starts 
for 
the intervention group)

10.0 STUDY  PROCEDURES
10.1 Methods:    After enrollment as above, co-investigators of this study or the assigned 
coordinator will be doing the consent. Patient will be randomized to intervention and control 
arms in a 2:1 ratio. The intervention arm will receive a dedicated workshop for one and a half 
hours every 2 weeks.  We aim to start a 6 month long program with weekly creative writings 
workshops, and patient enrollment in the study will continue through the 1st 4.5 months of the 6 
month period so that the last enrolled patient could complete 2 classes per month for two 
months. Each patient will be asked to attend at least two classes per month for a total of two 
months. These workshops will be held at Hershey Medical Center (HMC). At the initiation of the 
study along with consent we will collect baseline scores in both groups for each parameter as 
below. Somatic Symptom Burden (SSM-8 - Figure 2 - reference section), depression symptoms 
using PHQ-9 (Figure 3 – reference section), and anxiety symptoms using GAD-7 (Figure 4 –
reference section) will be collected monthly and following intervention completion. 
We will  collect mood scores pre and post each session. We will use Emotional Thermometer 
Scale (EMS) from Dr. Alex J. Mitchell (Feb. 2010), diagram for scales is shown in figure 1. 
Please see supplementary index for a letter of permission to use from Dr. Mitchell. We will give 
the Thermometer scales and collect scores pre and post each session and also collect scores 
pre and post completion of entire course. Control group will do EMS on monthly basis along with 
other parameters. At the end of the study we will review all participants’ medical charts to count 
view the number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations each participant experienced 
STUDY00008646
Approval: 1/24/2020
 Institutional  Review Board
page 35  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  during the  study period. These will be further broken down in categories based on cancer 
related vs non-cancer related visits.  We will also review their most current cancer disease 
status after completion of the workshops and categorize whether their status is considered to be 
stable, progressing, or in remission. Both groups will also receive follow up mood and symptom 
surveys twice a month for up to 2 months after completion of the participant’s two to three 
month study period. 
The control  arm will receive a book (i.e., Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) on creative 
writing and asked to read and do writing activities for one and a half hours once every two 
weeks. At the completion of the two-month participation or completion of 4 sessions control 
patients will be given the opportunity to enroll in the creative writing workshops for the 
remainder of the study period of 6 months. We will collect scores from control arm through the 
same Emotion Thermometers Scale on a monthly basis. Pre-intervention scores will be 
obtained at the time of consent or one week prior to the planned start of session 1 for workshop 
(either in the clinic if possible or mail the score sheet to patients with an enclosed stamped 
envelope for return of the scales). Depending on participant preference, we can send them 
emails of the REDCAP surveys containing the same information at set intervals. A sample of the 
REDCAP surveys is included in supplementary materials. We will also send participants in the 
control arm a stamped return envelope on a monthly basis if not able to get score sheets in a 
clinic or over REDCAP, depending on patient convenience and preference. We will call the 
participants once every 3-4 weeks to check in on their progress. Please see a calendar at the 
end for details. 
To assess  for possible confounding results of patients participating in the concurrent exercise 
study, we will ask participants if they are also enrolled in the exercise study at enrollment and 
perform a subset analysis for patients who are in the exercise study. They will be randomized 
into either control or intervention group in the same manner as the other patients in the study. 
We will additionally include a section of the survey to ask about regular exercise (more than 30 
minutes, three times a week) and do a subset analysis of these patients as well.   
 
We will  be collaborating with the Department of psychiatry at HMC - Dr. Aditya Joshi, Dr. 
Michael Hayes, and Dr. Erika Saunders. Any subject who requests psychiatry follow up will be 
referred to Dr. Michael Hayes.  If participants report the presence of suicidal ideation per 
question nine on the PHQ-9 [i.e., Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting 
yourself in some way], they will be referred on an urgent basis to Dr. Michael Hayes or Dr. 
Aditya Joshi. In the event Dr. Hayes and/or Dr. Joshi are unavailable for follow-up,  If any active 
suicidal thoughts are reported, participants will be referred directly to Emergency Department at 
Hershey Medical Center. 
10.2 Clinical  Covariates:  Detailed clinical covariates will be obtained from questionnaires and 
medical record review including demographics (age, gender, race), cancer type and stage, 
psychiatric history, chemotherapy regimen and medication use.  
10.3 Creative  Workshop: Write from Heart: This workshop for cancer patients usually lasts one 
and a half hours and is broken into several parts. Usually beginning with inspirational quotes or 
passages from writings of  respected authors, to shift mood and illuminated deeper thought and 
reflection. The next phase of the class consists of sharing a beautiful or whimsical object 
handed person to person or placed in the middle of the table to stimulate both curiosity and the 
senses. When participants are able to relax fully, in tranquil and focused surroundings the 
imagination easily transforms a bright polished stone or a glass heart with inner fractures into a 
metaphorical image. The technique of journaling is also encouraged in class, as a way to 
promote inner awareness to strengthen writing skills and to guide students to reach for their own 
comfort and consolation, when not in class. Within our setting, it is normal, though not 
mandatory that writing may lean toward the cancer experience. At the end of each series, 
STUDY00008646

 Institutional  Review Board
page 36  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  students would  have learned how to trust their artistic instincts, connect more courageously with 
the world of their emotions and transform their fears and revelations about cancer into words on 
the page. 
10.4     Emotional  Thermometers Scale: The Emotion Thermometers tool is a simple rapid modular 
screening tool  for detection and monitoring of emotional disorders in clinical practice. It was 
created by  Dr. Alex J Mitchell and has a simple visual-analogue design. It is easy for most 
patients (including  older people) to understand, quick to administer and simple to score. We 
have already  got permission from Dr. Alex J Mitchell for royalty free usage of this scale for 2 
years starting  from Aug, 2016 till Aug 2018. We will be getting permission from him to extend 
the usage  for an additional 1-2 years. 
10.5    Survey  of Depression and Anxiety symptoms: For anxiety, we will use Generalized Anxiety  
Disorder 7-item  (GAD-7) validated scale by Robert Spitzer et al. For depression we will use 
Patient Health  Questionnaire 9–item (PHQ-9) validated scale by Robert Spitzer et al.  Both of 
these scales  do not require any permission for reproduction, display, distribution or usage. 
10.6 Control group activities:  Participants randomized into the control group were asked to 
maintain their usual follow up while also reading a book on creative writing for one and a half 
hours every other week for three months, logging their activity for verification of task completion.  
Their mode scores will be measured as mentioned above.
12.0 Statistical  Plan
12.1 Statistical  Analysis Plan
Participants’ basic  demographic and baseline clinical measurements will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Those summarizations will be based on all patients as well as on patients 
within each group. This study has several main groups of outcome variables, which reflect several 
different domains of patient’s mental health. The first group is the emotion thermometer (which has 
five sub-scales), the second is the somatic symptom scale (SSS-8), the third is the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the fourth is the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7), 
which measures participants’ anxiety. All the above outcome variable groups are based on 
questionnaires using Likert-scale questions to take the measurements, and each group may 
involve multiple sub-dimensions. Both the intervention group and the control group have repeated 
measures of the outcomes as shown in Figure 1. Graphical methods (such as the line plot of 
mean/SD values vs. time) will first be used to illustrate the mean and standard deviation values of 
the mode, depression, and anxiety scores through the time for both groups. These methods will 
help us detect the patterns of how the scores change over time (within-group change) and how the 
scores differ between groups. We will further use the linear mixed-effect model for repeated 
measures to analyze the within-group and between-group differences. Every sub-dimension will be 
analyzed individually, but we will also analyze the composite score for the dimensions. For the 
patients in the control group this study involves two stages (week 1-12 and week 13-20), and at the 
end of the 12th week, they can join the intervention group. This setting will allow us to study the 
effect of the intervention on the control group alone. For this part of analyses, linear mixed-effect 
models will be set up with the stage serves as an indicator variable in the model. The comparison 
of outcome variables between certain time points will also be done using paired tests. We will 
further investigate the possible factors that might affect the change of outcome variables over time. 
The factors are gender, race, marital status, time from cancer diagnosis (first 3 months, 3-6 
months, more than 6 months) and cancer stages. This part of analyses will mainly be focused on 
the intervention group and the above factors will be examined in the linear mixed-effect models. All 
analyses will be performed using statistical software SAS version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC, USA) and the statistical significance level to be used is 0.05.

page 37  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  12.2 Sample  size considerations:
We plan  to enroll a total of 60 participants in the study – with 40 participants in the intervention 
group and 20 participants in the control group (2:1 ratio). This sample size is mainly determined by 
the capacity of the workshop. With this sample size we are able to detect a standard effect size 
(the mean difference measured in common standard deviation) of 0.45 with at least 80% statistical 
power (using two-sample repeated measure ANOVA model, assuming four time-points, and the 
within-patient auto-correlation being 0.2) . 
12.0 CONFIDENTIALITY
How will  confidentiality of data be maintained?  Check all that apply.
 Paper-based  records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel 
involved in the study.
 Use  of a code number to label all research data
 Use  of a study ID code linking list that will be maintained separate from the research data files 
on the HMC server (identifiers)
 Computer-based  files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through 
the use of access privileges and passwords.
 Prior  to access to any study-related information, personnel will be required to sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.
 Whenever  feasible, identifiers will be removed from study-related information.
 A  Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at 
risk of criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject’s financial standing, employability, 
or liability.
 A  waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the 
subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of 
confidentiality.  (This is not an option for FDA-regulated research.) 
 Precautions  are in place to ensure the data is secure by using passwords and encryption, 
because the research involves web-based surveys.  
 Audio  and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identification of subjects. 
 Other  (specify): All data entered and stored in RedCap database (the proxy PI has an active 
RedCap account) and will be used to transfer data in a deidentified format only.
12.6 Identifiers  associated with data and/or specimens
Identifiers like  dates and medical record numbers will be used.
12.7 Use  of Codes, Master List
Use of  a code linking list will be maintained separate from the research data files on the 
HMC server.  All data entered and stored in HIPAA compliant RedCap database (the 
proxy PI has an active RedCap account) and will be used to transfer data in a deidentified 
format only.
12.8 Storage  of Data 
All electronic files will  be encrypted and/or password protected-EXCEL database, stored 
on a hard drive in locked HMC offices. Paper files will be stored in locked HMC offices/labs of 
the research team. These will be deleted/ shredded/destroyed at the end of study approval 
period. Information will be kept confidential and private and managed according to HIPAA 
guidelines.
12.9 Access  to Data 
Research team consisting  of PI, Co-investigators, team participants, biostatisticians only 
will have access to the data

15.0 RISK/BENEFIT  ASSESSMENT
15.1 Potential Study  Risks
Minimal. It  is an intervention to determine changes in mood scales before and after creative 
writing workshop, and we anticipate minimal risk (breach of confidentiality – measures taken as above) for 
patients regarding their underlying cancer or treatment.
15.2 Potential Study  Benefits
Participants randomized to  the intervention with creative writing workshops may experience an 
improvement in their mood. We suspect that patients may have better adherence to their cancer therapy, but 
we do not expect any effect on cancer overall.

time during their training to conduct the research. The study team will meet at biweekly intervals 
to review progress and provide feedback.
18.6 Availability  of medical or psychological resources:
We will  be collaborating with the Department of psychiatry at PSHMC - Dr. Aditya Joshi, Dr. 
Michael Hayes, and Dr. Erika Saunders. Any subject who request psychiatry follow up will be 
referred to Dr. Joshi.
18.7 Process  for informing Study Team
The study  team will meet at biweekly intervals to review the progress of the study and to provide 
feedback.
22.0 ADVERSE  EVENT REPORTING: 
Reporting Adverse  Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to the Responsible IRB
The only possible adverse event  or unanticipated problem is the loss of confidentiality, and as far as 
loss of confidentiality is concerned, in accordance with applicable policies of The Pennsylvania State 
University Institutional Review Board (IRB), the investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed or 
reported harm (adverse event) experienced by a subject or other individual, which in the opinion of the 
investigator is determined to be (1) unexpected; and (2) probably related to the research procedures. 
Harms (adverse events) will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the IRB policies and 
procedures.
23.0 STUDY  MONITORING, AUDITING AND INSPECTING
The investigator  will permit study-related monitoring, audits and inspections by the Penn State quality 
assurance program office(s), IRB, the sponsor, and government regulatory bodies, of all study related 
documents (e.g., source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities 
(e.g. workshop room etc.).

page 46  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  Dear Reviewers,
We wanted  to bring your attention to 3 protocol changes we have completed that we describe below.
2.Eligibility criteria  has  been changed from cancer patients with new diagnosis or progression in the last 
three months from consent, to any patient with a cancer diagnosis. 
Rational: Difficulty  with participant accrual. 
Although patients with new  diagnosis or recent progression were originally chosen for this study due to our 
belief that they would most benefit from this intervention, we have found that after a month and a half of 
recruitment, we have only been able to recruit 15 out of our goal of 60 patients. We are concerned that we 
will not be able to meet our enrollment goal and thus want to expand to more patients. We believe that 
time from diagnosis is an important factor and will thus do a subset analysis at the completion of the study 
stratifying by time since diagnosis at enrollment (less than 3 months, 3-6 months, more than 6 months) to 
ensure that we still capture that information. We found that many individuals who we approached felt very 
overwhelmed by their diagnosis and frequency of other visits necessary for initial treatment of the 
diagnosis and were reluctant to add on another commitment. By expanding to patients further along from 
their diagnosis, we hope to be able to increase our study enrollment. 
3.Number  of classes patients are asked to attend has been decreased from 6 classes over 3 months to 4 
classes over two months. 
Rational: Difficulty  with participant accrual. 
In addition  to the above stated reason, we found many individuals expressing reluctance to join the study 
due to concerns about the prolonged commitment to attending classes for three months. We felt that by 
decreasing the number to four sessions over the span of two months, attending 2 sessions per month, as 
opposed to six sessions, every other week over three months, may help us engage more participants, 
allowing them more flexibility with their schedule, particularly during the summer months when many 
individuals have vacation plans. Subsequently, we have noticed that once individuals start attending the 
sessions, they greatly enjoy them and want to continue, thus we believe that despite hanging the minimum 
number of classes we request participants attend, we may still be able to collect data for individual 
patients beyond 2 months. 
4.The  Enrollment Period has been extended from 3 months to 4 months after initiation of study to comply 
with change in number of classes requested from participants. 
Rational: Difficulty  with participant accrual. 
Our enrollment  period is based on the last day individuals can enroll and still complete the requested 
number of classes. Previously, for a 6-month class schedule with a request for 3 months of participation, 
we would enroll for three months. By changing the requested participation to 2 months, we can extend the 
enrollment period by 1 additional month while still having individuals be able to complete the necessary 
number of classes.  
5. Brochure  added 
Rational: Difficulty  with participant accrual. 
We have  received multiple requests from potential participants as well as physicians interested in sending 
their patients to us for a brochure that they can have to help them learn more about the study and contact 
us more easily. We believe that the addition of this brochure may significantly help increase our accrual 
rate, especially by decreasing effort on the part of other providers.

3.0 PROTOCOL  ABSTRACT
The primary  purpose of this study is to determine whether creative writing in newly diagnosed cancer 
patients and those with recent progression in their disease will have a positive impact on their mental 
health. Using a randomized controlled trial approach, emotion thermometers will be employed to 
evaluate participants’ responses on a number of domains, such as anxiety, depression, despair, and 
anger along with a series of survey questions to monitor changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms. 
Open-ended survey questions will be used to capture how a creative writing intervention impacts 
participants’ experience of their illness. Melissa Greene’s Write from the Heart program focuses more 
on creative writing rather than cancer focused topics. Patients in the intervention arm will complete –
one and a half hour group sessions every two weeks over the span of 3 months. Participants in the 
active control arm will be provided a book (i.e., Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) about 
creative writing and will be asked to do activities for 1.5 hrs every 2 weeks for a period of 2-3 months.
4.0 OBJECTIVES
4.1 Primary  Objectives:  
Mental  wellness before and after intervention in the intervention and control groups. A 
validated Emotional Thermometer Scales will be used to predict changes in parameters 
reflecting participants’ mental health pre- and post-intervention. Survey questions 
focused on symptoms of depression and anxiety will be used to monitor for changes in 
mental wellness pre- and post-intervention. 
4.2 Secondary  Objectives : 
Comparison  of mood scores, depression and anxiety symptoms versus frequency of 
attendance in the intervention arm. 
Comparison  of somatic symptom burden between intervention and control group.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms after workshop between genders. 
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms between patients living alone versus with family.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms between various cancer types.
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms in individuals who have previously attended a creative writing class versus 
those who have not. 
Difference  in mood scores, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms in individuals who completed control group activity and then enrolled in the 
workshops and attended at least one session. 
Comparison  of the frequency of emergency room visits and hospitalizations between 
intervention and control group during the study period.

5.0 BACKGROUND
5.1 Scientific  Background and Gaps 
Cancer is  a life-threatening, feared diagnosis and is a source of great distress in patients.  Hence in 
addition to treating cancer, one must address the emotional well-being of patients. 
Creative activity  has a significant history in providing a wide range of psychological and 
physiological benefits for cancer survivors (King et al., 2012). When individuals experience a stressful 
life event or crisis, the higher verbal functions in the cerebral cortex become less accessible (Hass-
Cohen, 2008.) Therefore, patients who face such stressful life events of cancer are often left without 
words to describe their experiences of feelings (Green & Young, 2015). Findings from Green and 
Young (2015) suggest that creative visual expression, engaging both in an individual and the 
therapeutic setting, offered an opportunity for young adult survivors to express their emotions from 
deep within their bodies. It created self-understanding and a sense of healing. 
In another study  by Bolton (2007) patients indicated that they found the therapeutic writing process 
beneficial. For example, one participant narrated, “It made it less traumatic than it might have been 
otherwise.” Creative writing has been recognized to explore and express personal thoughts, feelings, 
and experiences. Lau Tsu (1973) showed that writing facilitated patients’ ability to discover what they 
thought felt and remembered. Therapeutic creative writing enhanced their awareness of and ability to 
express issues to which attention and focus are required. (Esterhing BA et al., 1999)
There is  a substantial area of agreement that language, narrative storytelling, forms an essential 
element in the construction of a coherent identity, sense of self and connectedness to others, and 
therefore, it is a powerful tool in creative therapy (Smyth, 1998; Wright & Chung, 2001). Roe and 
Davidson (2005) argue that processes of re-authoring one’s life story are actually integral components 
of the recovery process itself. A study by Stanton (2002) of breast cancer patients prompted to write 
about their cancer experience showed a significant decrease in self-reported somatic symptoms and 
medical appointment visits for cancer-related morbidities three months after participation in the study. A 
follow-up study by Stanton (2013) encouraged breast cancer patients to create personal websites to 
chronicle their experience and to communicate with their social network. This study showed significant 
improvement in positive mood and depressive symptoms after 6 months, particularly in patients 
undergoing medical therapy at that time.  These studies further support that the act of narrative story 
telling can improve patient wellbeing. 
Furthermore, King  et al. (2012) suggest that writing can contribute to repair of symbolic functioning 
and contribute to the development of personal identity. The researchers concluded that, of all the 
creative arts, writing is least dependent on equipment and/or special environments. Writing workshops 
are probably better provided by professional writers than by mental health professionals. When health 
professionals provide activities such as a writing workshop, there is a risk that identification with the 
illness is reinforced. On the other hand, when a professional writer provides a similar activity, it is the 
participant’s identity as a writer that is reinforced, rather than their identity as a person with an illness. 
(King et al., 2012)
Moreover, there  is emerging consensus in the UK and USA that there might be advantages if 
writing therapy is received from facilitators who themselves are trained writers and can work in 
collaboration with health care professionals. (Hunt & Sampson, 1998; Mc Loughlin, 2004).

 Institutional  Review Board
page 53  of 69 IRB APPLICATION    5.2   Previous Data  
We conducted  a pilot study to determine feasibility whether cancer patients can be enrolled, 
randomized and retained for four weeks for creative writing classes (Feasibility was defined as 50% of 
our enrolled patients on intervention arm (IA) could attend at least 2 classes). We anticipated enrolling 
45 patients over the period of 2 months with randomization into 2 arms: IA and standard of care (SOC). 
“Write from the Heart” a series of creative writing workshops (CWW) were conducted on IA. Subjects in 
IA had four, 2-hour weekly CWW whereas SOC arm did not receive any session. We used validated 
Emotional Thermometer Scales (ETS), ranging 0 (best)-10 (worst), to predict changes in a number of 
parameters reflecting patient’s mental health pre and post intervention. ETS has five dimensions 
(distress, anxiety, depression, anger and need help), which are all continuous variables.  Due to time 
constraints we were not able to accrue the desired number of patients. A total of 16 patients were 
accrued in 1 month period -11 in IA and 5 in SOC. 7 out of 11 (63%) patients enrolled in IA attended at 
least 75%  of classes. Comparisons were made using two-sample T-tests. Although sample size was 
small, IA  did show a decreasing pattern on Total Emotion Score (TES), particularly in depression and 
anxiety scores  (See table 1 and figure 1, 2). For each visit, post-class scores were lower than pre-class 
scores. We  observed that it is feasible for cancer patients to attend focused workshops geared towards 
mental health wellbeing. IA showed a trend towards mood improvement, although was not shown to be 
statistically significant which may be attributed to the small sample size. Having shown the feasibility of 
such a study, we hope to increase the sample size and include more specific methods for quantifying 
mood improvement in the patient groups. In addition, after reviewing the suggestions (post completion 
of the study) from the patients who attended these sessions on the study, we concluded that 1.5hours 
of class twice a month is feasible and helpful for patients.

6.0 RATIONALE  AND HYPOTHESIS
6.1 RATIONALE:
Cancer generates an  increased sense of distress than non-malignant diseases with poor 
prognoses (Mishel et al., 1984). Persistent mental distress for prolonged periods leads to anxiety and 
depression. The rate of depression in cancer patients is thought to be up to three times higher than in 
the general population (Linden et al., 2012). Depression leads to a poorer quality of life (QOL) and 
affects patient outcomes, with depression resulting in higher rates of mortality in cancer (Colleoni et al., 
2000, Pinquart et al., 2010). A meta-analysis revealed that minor or major depression increases 
mortality rates by up to 39%, and that patients displaying even few depressive symptoms may be at a 
25% increased risk of mortality (Satin et al., 2009). The impact of mood and mental wellbeing on cancer 
progression is considered important by doctors and patients, with >70% of oncologists and 85% of 
patients believing that mood affects the progression of cancer (Lemon et al., 2004). Our previous data 
as mentioned before shows that creative writing is feasible and needs to be further studied to 
understand the effect of group therapy with focused workshop in newly diagnosed or patients with 
recent recurrence. In addition, we observed that the emotional thermometer scale was not enough to 
capture the mood of the patients. For example, some patients felt significantly better after attending 
these sessions and were able to cope with their symptoms but the emotional scale did not reflect that 
benefit. 
6.2 HYPOTHESIS:
This study aims  to look at the impact of participating in creative writing workshop group Write 
from the Heart, on cancer patients’ emotional well-being. Keeping previous studies in mind, a

page 55  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  professional writer  will conduct the workshops, which will enhance the participant’s ability to express 
and enhance their awareness. We anticipate that participation in the workshop will result in a positive 
effect on the parameters being studied, enabling patients to cope with their illness/cancer better.  We 
hypothesize that group sessions of creative writing workshop could be better than individual sessions.

9.0 STUDY  DESIGN
  9.1 Phase
Phase II
9.2 Design
The focus  of this study is to determine the difference in mental health parameters following the 
participation of cancer patients in a creative writing workshop. Participants will be randomized 
within strata formed by cancer type in order to assure that these potentially important 
confounding variables are balanced across groups. Patients will be enrolled on a rolling basis 
over a three-month period, allowing patients in intervention arm to participate in 2-3 months 
workshops (workshops would be held once every 2 weeks). Patients in control arm will be 
provided a book (Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) about creative writing and will be 
asked to do activities for 1.5 hours every 2 weeks. After three months, control group participants 
can join creative writing workshops at their discretion for the remaining period for writing 
workshops. Both group members will receive follow up surveys twice a month for two months at 
the completion of the participant’s three-month study period.  
9.3 Study  Duration 
Estimated time  to enroll all subjects = 3-5 months (Patients will start being enrolled after IRB 
approval and  we will continue the enrollment up to 3 months from the time the 1st class starts for 
the intervention group)
Length of  a participant's participation = 2 - 6 months; Follow up after participant’s completion of 
classes =  2 months

groups. Validated Depression and Anxiety questionnaires will be used to predict 
changes, the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively. 
9.4.2 Secondary  endpoints: 
Mood  and symptoms before and after at least 2 sessions of intervention. 
Self-reported  somatic symptoms pre and post intervention in two groups. We will use the 
Somatic Symptom Scale – 8 (SSM-8) to quantify somatic symptom burden. 
Difference  in scores and symptoms between various genders.
Difference  in scores and symptoms between patients living alone versus with family.
Difference  in scores and symptoms in different cancer types.  
Difference  in scores and symptoms versus number of classes attended. 
Differences  between individual mood scores for patients in the control group who later 
switch to intervention group and attend at least one session
Mood  and symptom scores up to 2 months after completion of the study. 
9.4.3    Exploratory endpoints
Difference  in number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations during study period 
between control and intervention group.

10.0 STUDY  PROCEDURES
10.1 Methods:    After enrollment as above, co-investigators of this study or the assigned 
coordinator will be doing the consent. Patient will be randomized to intervention and control 
arms in a 2:1 ratio. The intervention arm will receive a dedicated workshop for one and a half 
hours every 2 weeks.  We aim to start a 6 month long program with weekly creative writings 
workshops, and patient enrollment in the study will continue through the 1st 4 months of the 6 
month period so that the last enrolled patient could complete the 2 month study period of every 
two week workshops. Each patient will be asked to attend at least two classes per month for a 
total of two months. These workshops will be held at Hershey Medical Center (HMC). At the 
initiation of the study along with consent we will collect baseline scores in both groups for each 
parameter as below. Somatic Symptom Burden (SSM-8 - Figure 2 - reference section), 
depression symptoms using PHQ-9 (Figure 3 – reference section), and anxiety symptoms using 
GAD-7 (Figure 4 –reference section) will be collected monthly and following intervention 
completion. 
We will  collect mood scores pre and post each session. We will use Emotional Thermometer 
Scale (EMS) from Dr. Alex J. Mitchell (Feb. 2010), diagram for scales is shown in figure 1. 
Please see supplementary index for a letter of permission to use from Dr. Mitchell. We will give 
the Thermometer scales and collect scores pre and post each session and also collect scores 
pre and post completion of entire course. Control group will do EMS on monthly basis along with 
other parameters. At the end of the study we will review all participants’ medical charts to count 
view the number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations each participant experienced 
STUDY00008646

 Institutional  Review Board
page 59  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  during the  study period. These will be further broken down in categories based on cancer 
related vs non-cancer related visits.  We will also review their most current cancer disease 
status after completion of the workshops and categorize whether their status is considered to be 
stable, progressing, or in remission. Both groups will also receive follow up mood and symptom 
surveys twice a month for up to 2 months after completion of the participant’s two to three 
month study period. 
The control  arm will receive a book (i.e., Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) on creative 
writing and asked to read and do writing activities for one and a half hours once every two 
weeks. At the completion of the two-month participation or completion of 4 sessions control 
patients will be given the opportunity to enroll in the creative writing workshops for the 
remainder of the study period of 6 months. We will collect scores from control arm through the 
same Emotion Thermometers Scale on a monthly basis. Pre-intervention scores will be 
obtained at the time of consent or one week prior to the planned start of session 1 for workshop 
(either in the clinic if possible or mail the score sheet to patients with an enclosed stamped 
envelope for return of the scales). Depending on participant preference, we can send them 
emails of the REDCAP surveys containing the same information at set intervals. A sample of the 
REDCAP surveys is included in supplementary materials. We will also send participants in the 
control arm a stamped return envelope on a monthly basis if not able to get score sheets in a 
clinic or over REDCAP, depending on patient convenience and preference. We will call the 
participants once every 3-4 weeks to check in on their progress. Please see a calendar at the 
end for details. 
To assess  for possible confounding results of patients participating in the concurrent exercise 
study, we will ask participants if they are also enrolled in the exercise study at enrollment and 
perform a subset analysis for patients who are in the exercise study. They will be randomized 
into either control or intervention group in the same manner as the other patients in the study. 
We will additionally include a section of the survey to ask about regular exercise (more than 30 
minutes, three times a week) and do a subset analysis of these patients as well.   
 
We will  be collaborating with the Department of psychiatry at HMC - Dr. Aditya Joshi, Dr. 
Michael Hayes, and Dr. Erika Saunders. Any subject who requests psychiatry follow up will be 
referred to Dr. Michael Hayes.  If participants report the presence of suicidal ideation per 
question nine on the PHQ-9 [i.e., Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting 
yourself in some way], they will be referred on an urgent basis to Dr. Michael Hayes or Dr. 
Aditya Joshi. In the event Dr. Hayes and/or Dr. Joshi are unavailable for follow-up,  If any active 
suicidal thoughts are reported, participants will be referred directly to Emergency Department at 
Hershey Medical Center. 
10.2 Clinical  Covariates:  Detailed clinical covariates will be obtained from questionnaires and 
medical record review including demographics (age, gender, race), cancer type and stage, 
psychiatric history, chemotherapy regimen and medication use.  
10.3 Creative  Workshop: Write from Heart: This workshop for cancer patients usually lasts one 
and a half hours and is broken into several parts. Usually beginning with inspirational quotes or 
passages from writings of  respected authors, to shift mood and illuminated deeper thought and 
reflection. The next phase of the class consists of sharing a beautiful or whimsical object 
handed person to person or placed in the middle of the table to stimulate both curiosity and the 
senses. When participants are able to relax fully, in tranquil and focused surroundings the 
imagination easily transforms a bright polished stone or a glass heart with inner fractures into a 
metaphorical image. The technique of journaling is also encouraged in class, as a way to 
promote inner awareness to strengthen writing skills and to guide students to reach for their own 
comfort and consolation, when not in class. Within our setting, it is normal, though not 
mandatory that writing may lean toward the cancer experience. At the end of each series, 
STUDY00008646

page 60  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  students would  have learned how to trust their artistic instincts, connect more courageously with 
the world of their emotions and transform their fears and revelations about cancer into words on 
the page. 
10.4     Emotional  Thermometers Scale: The Emotion Thermometers tool is a simple rapid modular 
screening tool  for detection and monitoring of emotional disorders in clinical practice. It was 
created by  Dr. Alex J Mitchell and has a simple visual-analogue design. It is easy for most 
patients (including  older people) to understand, quick to administer and simple to score. We 
have already  got permission from Dr. Alex J Mitchell for royalty free usage of this scale for 2 
years starting  from Aug, 2016 till Aug 2018. We will be getting permission from him to extend 
the usage  for an additional 1-2 years. 
10.5    Survey  of Depression and Anxiety symptoms: For anxiety, we will use Generalized Anxiety  
Disorder 7-item  (GAD-7) validated scale by Robert Spitzer et al. For depression we will use 
Patient Health  Questionnaire 9–item (PHQ-9) validated scale by Robert Spitzer et al.  Both of 
these scales  do not require any permission for reproduction, display, distribution or usage. 
10.6 Control group activities:  Participants randomized into the control group were asked to 
maintain their usual follow up while also reading a book on creative writing for one and a half 
hours every other week for three months, logging their activity for verification of task completion.  
Their mode scores will be measured as mentioned above.
13.0 Statistical  Plan
13.1 Statistical  Analysis Plan
Participants’ basic  demographic and baseline clinical measurements will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Those summarizations will be based on all patients as well as on patients 
within each group. This study has several main groups of outcome variables, which reflect several 
different domains of patient’s mental health. The first group is the emotion thermometer (which has 
five sub-scales), the second is the somatic symptom scale (SSS-8), the third is the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the fourth is the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7), 
which measures participants’ anxiety. All the above outcome variable groups are based on 
questionnaires using Likert-scale questions to take the measurements, and each group may 
involve multiple sub-dimensions. Both the intervention group and the control group have repeated 
measures of the outcomes as shown in Figure 1. Graphical methods (such as the line plot of 
mean/SD values vs. time) will first be used to illustrate the mean and standard deviation values of 
the mode, depression, and anxiety scores through the time for both groups. These methods will 
help us detect the patterns of how the scores change over time (within-group change) and how the 
scores differ between groups. We will further use the linear mixed-effect model for repeated 
measures to analyze the within-group and between-group differences. Every sub-dimension will be 
analyzed individually, but we will also analyze the composite score for the dimensions. For the 
patients in the control group this study involves two stages (week 1-12 and week 13-20), and at the 
end of the 12th week, they can join the intervention group. This setting will allow us to study the 
effect of the intervention on the control group alone. For this part of analyses, linear mixed-effect 
models will be set up with the stage serves as an indicator variable in the model. The comparison 
of outcome variables between certain time points will also be done using paired tests. We will 
further investigate the possible factors that might affect the change of outcome variables over time. 
The factors are gender, race, marital status, time from cancer diagnosis (first 3 months, 3-6 
months, more than 6 months) and cancer stages. This part of analyses will mainly be focused on 
the intervention group and the above factors will be examined in the linear mixed-effect models. All 
analyses will be performed using statistical software SAS version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC, USA) and the statistical significance level to be used is 0.05.

page 61  of 69 IRB APPLICATION  13.2 Sample  size considerations:
We plan  to enroll a total of 60 participants in the study – with 40 participants in the intervention 
group and 20 participants in the control group (2:1 ratio). This sample size is mainly determined by 
the capacity of the workshop. With this sample size we are able to detect a standard effect size 
(the mean difference measured in common standard deviation) of 0.45 with at least 80% statistical 
power (using two-sample repeated measure ANOVA model, assuming four time-points, and the 
within-patient auto-correlation being 0.2) . 
12.0 CONFIDENTIALITY
How will  confidentiality of data be maintained?  Check all that apply.
 Paper-based  records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel 
involved in the study.
 Use  of a code number to label all research data
 Use  of a study ID code linking list that will be maintained separate from the research data files 
on the HMC server (identifiers)
 Computer-based  files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through 
the use of access privileges and passwords.
 Prior  to access to any study-related information, personnel will be required to sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.
 Whenever  feasible, identifiers will be removed from study-related information.
 A  Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at 
risk of criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject’s financial standing, employability, 
or liability.
 A  waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the 
subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of 
confidentiality.  (This is not an option for FDA-regulated research.) 
 Precautions  are in place to ensure the data is secure by using passwords and encryption, 
because the research involves web-based surveys.  
 Audio  and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identification of subjects. 
 Other  (specify): All data entered and stored in RedCap database (the proxy PI has an active 
RedCap account) and will be used to transfer data in a deidentified format only.
12.11 Identifiers  associated with data and/or specimens
Identifiers like  dates and medical record numbers will be used.
12.12 Use  of Codes, Master List
Use of  a code linking list will be maintained separate from the research data files on the 
HMC server.  All data entered and stored in HIPAA compliant RedCap database (the 
proxy PI has an active RedCap account) and will be used to transfer data in a deidentified 
format only.
12.13 Storage  of Data 
All electronic files will  be encrypted and/or password protected-EXCEL database, stored 
on a hard drive in locked HMC offices. Paper files will be stored in locked HMC offices/labs of 
the research team. These will be deleted/ shredded/destroyed at the end of study approval 
period. Information will be kept confidential and private and managed according to HIPAA 
guidelines.
12.14 Access  to Data 
Research team consisting  of PI, Co-investigators, team participants, biostatisticians only 
will have access to the data

Protected health  information that will be obtained includes patient name, medical record number, and 
date of birth.  This information will be kept in a password-protected database in Excel sheet, behind the 
Pennsylvania State University firewall as well as the RedCAp database (Co-PI has an active RedCap account).  
Identifying information will be stored in a separate portion of the database, linked to the analytical database 
through an alphanumeric code.  Published data will only report aggregate, de-identified results.
14.0 DATA  AND SAFETY MONITORING
All clinical information will be kept confidential, in a password-protected database or locked, secure 
location and managed according to HIPAA guidelines.

14.9 Multi-center Research
Not applicable
15.0 RISK/BENEFIT  ASSESSMENT
15.1 Potential Study  Risks
Minimal. It  is an intervention to determine changes in mood scales before and after creative 
writing workshop, and we anticipate minimal risk (breach of confidentiality – measures taken as above) for 
patients regarding their underlying cancer or treatment.
15.2 Potential Study  Benefits
Participants randomized to  the intervention with creative writing workshops may experience an 
improvement in their mood. We suspect that patients may have better adherence to their cancer therapy, but 
we do not expect any effect on cancer overall. 
  15.3 Alternatives to  Participation
Not participating.

The only possible adverse event  or unanticipated problem is the loss of confidentiality, and as far as 
loss of confidentiality is concerned, in accordance with applicable policies of The Pennsylvania State 
University Institutional Review Board (IRB), the investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed or 
reported harm (adverse event) experienced by a subject or other individual, which in the opinion of the 
investigator is determined to be (1) unexpected; and (2) probably related to the research procedures. 
Harms (adverse events) will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the IRB policies and 
procedures.
26.0 STUDY MONITORING,  AUDITING AND INSPECTING
The investigator  will permit study-related monitoring, audits and inspections by the Penn State quality 
assurance program office(s), IRB, the sponsor, and government regulatory bodies, of all study related 
documents (e.g., source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities 
(e.g. workshop room etc.).

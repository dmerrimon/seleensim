1. INTRODUCTION  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the analyses and data presentations fo r protocol 
CR-6305 Version 4.0 Amendment 3.0.  
This document will serve as the final guidance for all the statistical analysis for this study and 
will supersede the Statistical Method section in the protocol if there are any discrepancies. Any deviation from the analysis plan will be  documented as such in the clinical study report.  
1.1. Study Objectives 
Primary Objectives:  
The primary purpose of this randomized study is to demonstrate that the 4GT Test lens senofilcon A with new UV -blocker, in its final lens design ECL600, meets the design validation 
requirements related to overall CLUE comfort, logMAR visual acuity, quality of vision in bright light, eye health, and fit acceptance.  
 Secondary Objective:  
The secondary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the Test lens is equal or better than 
marketed product senofilcon A (ACUVUE ® OASYS, Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.) 
with regards to overall CLUE vision and handling.  
 
Other observations of interest include adverse events, keratometry, surface characteristics (deposits and wettability), daily wear time, reasons for discontinuation, and lens damage.  
2. STUDY DESIGN 
2.1. Overview  
This study is a randomized, 2- visit, partially subject-masked, 2- arm parallel, dispensing trial.  
Approximately 236 subjects (118 subjects /arm) will be screen ed and enrolled to ensure that at 
least 224 subjects  (112 subjects/arm) complete  the study . 
 
The study begins with an initial visit (Visit 1). If a subject is found to meet all eligibility criteria, they will be randomized to one of two study lenses (Test or Control) in a bilateral fashion.   If the subject is dispensed study lenses at the initial visit, one follow-up visit will be conducted. 
The follow- up visit will occur approximately two  weeks after the initial visit. Unscheduled 
follow-up visits may occur during the study. Subjects will be advised to wear the study lenses at least five (5) days per week for at least six (6) hours per day for a period of two weeks. There is no planned lens replacement scheduled during this study.

2.3. Targeted Study Population and Sample Size  
Approximately 236 subjects will be enrolled to ensure that at least 224  subjects will complete the 
study (~112 per/arm) .  Enrolled subjects will be habitual wearers of spherical contact lenses.  A ll 
subjects will be the age of 18 and <49 years old.  Eligible presbyopes will be those that wear full 
distance contact lenses in both eyes, then wear reading glasses over them.  Subjects will wear the Test or Control contact lenses approximately 2 weeks each in a bilateral fashion as DW.

2.4. Test Article Allocation and Masking 
Using a computer-generated randomization scheme will be used to randomly assign subjects, in 
blocks of 2, to one of the two possible study lenses  (TEST or CONTROL). The random scheme 
will be generated using the PROC PLAN procedure fr om SAS Software Version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).   The study site must follow the randomization scheme provided and complete enrollment according to the randomization list and not pre- select or assign subjects. The randomized 
assignment of subjects will be performed at the first visit prior to the first fitting. The following must have occurred prior to randomization:  
• Informed consent has been obtained 
• Subject meets all the inclusion / not meets exclusion criteria  
• Subject history and baseline information has been collected.  
 The dynamic nature of the Test lens makes it impossible to completely mask the study lens assignment. The subjects will be aware if they are wearing a photochromic lens or non-photochromic lens due to the function nature of the photochromic dye.  Additionally, there is a slight difference in physical appearance between the Test and Control lenses when the Test lens

3. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
3.1. Primary Endpoints  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints: 
 
CLUE Overall Comfort  
Overall comfort scores will be assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE ™)7 
questionnaire at the two- week follow -up.  CLUE is a validated patient -reported outcomes 
questionnaire to assess patient -experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, 
vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact -lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65.  
Derived CLUE™ scores using Item Response Theory (IRT)  follow a normal distribution with a 
population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive 
response with a range of 0 -120.  A 5-point increase in an average CLUE™ score translates into 
10% shift in the distribution of scores for population of soft contact lens we arers.7 The comfort 
scores will be generated using the flexMIRT software Version 3 or higher (Chapel Hill, NC).  
 
Distance Monocular Contact Lens Visual Acuity    
Distance monocular contact lens visual performance (logMAR) is assessed for each subject eye 
at the two -week follow -up evaluation using EDTRS charts  at a 4-meter distance  under the 
lighting condition, Bright illumination high contrast.  
 The subject is asked to read the visual acuity chart and the investigator will report in eCRF the letters missed  by the subject and the logMAR score will be derived in eCRF. In case the subject 
is unable to read at least 3 letters on the top line of the chart, the investigator will repeat the assessment at a closer distance: The subject starts at 4 meters, then will be moved to 3 meters then 0.5m closer at a time (e.g. 4m, 3m, 2.5m, 2.0m). If the subject correctly reads all 5 letters on 
the last line, the test will be stopped, and 0 missing will be recorded without moving subjects further away from the chart.  
 The formula to compute logMAR score at a different distance other than the chart specified 
distance (i.e. 4 meters)  is: 
 
LogMAR
2 = LogMAR 1 + log10(D 1/D2) 
where: 
• LogMAR 1 is the logMAR score at the chart specified distance D 1; 
• LogMAR 2 is the adjusted logMAR score at a different distance D 2. 
 The procedure is explained in the  in Appendix D of 
the study protocol.  
Vision Satisfaction in Bright Lighting 
Vision satisfaction in bright lighting  will be assessed using the individual item (Item ID: 
V015_1) “I was satisfied with the quality of my vision in bright lighting ” from the CLUE™ 

10 
 
CR-6305, Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0        Page 10 of 33  
VCT-0247 
 
  questionnaire. This item uses the response scale, 1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Disagree, 3: Neither 
Agree nor Disagree, 4: Agree and 5: Strongly Agree.  
 Primary Safety  Endpoints :  
 
Slit Lamp Findings (Grade 3 or Higher) 
Slit Lamp Findings will be assessed for each subject eye at all study visits (schedule and 
unscheduled). SLF is a binary response where Y=1 for at leas t one Grade 3 or 4 slit lamp finding. 
The percentage of eyes with Grade 3 or higher slit lamp findings will be analyzed and will include corneal infiltrates. Eyes with multiple  events will be counted only once.
 
 
The FDA Biomicroscopy Scale measures the sev erity of the ocular clinical findings and goes 
from Grade 0 (none) to Grade 4 (severe). The procedure is explained in the  in section 
12 Appendix D  of the study protocol. The individual ocular finding results are considered as 
other endpoints.  
  
Fit Acceptance Rate  
Acceptable lens fit will be assessed at all study visits (scheduled and unscheduled) for each subject eye.  Fit acceptance rate will be based on the lens fit acceptance of eyes wearing the Test lens only. Fit acceptance is a binary response where Y=1 if lens fit is acceptable and Y=0 
otherwise.  Unacceptable is defined as unacceptable if any one of the following criteria:  
• limbal exposure at primary gaze or with extreme eye movement;  
• edge lift;  
• excessive movement in primary up gaze;  
• insufficient movement in all three of the following conditions: primary gaze, up gaze, and push up test. 
 
 Eyes with multiple unacceptable fitting events will be counted only once. Fit rates of the Control 
lens will also be collected but are not a primary endpoint. 
 The procedure is explained in the  in section 12 Appendix D of the study protocol. The individual lens fitting characteristics are considered as other endpoints.  
3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
CLUE Overall Quality of Vision and Handling  
Overall Quality of vision and handling  scores will be assessed using the Contact Lens User 
Experience (CLUE)1 questionnaire at the two -week follow-up.  
 3.3. Other Endpoints  
• Average daily wear time (in Hours) 
• Subject’s Reported Ocular Symptoms  
• Lens fitting characteristics

7. GENERAL STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1. Statistical Software  
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software Version 
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)2. 
7.2. Summary St atistics 
Throughout the analysis of data, the results for each subject/eye will be used when available for 
summarization and statistical analysis.  Unscheduled visits will be summarized separately and will be excluded from the efficacy statistical analysis  but will be included in the analysis of 
safety endpoints (slit lamp findings and lens fitting) . 
 Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all baseline variables, efficacy variables and safety variables as approp riate.  Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will be provided for categorical data.  
Safety variables will be summarized on both safety and PP populations whereas efficacy variables 
will be summarized on the PP and ITT populations.  
7.3. Reporting Numerical Values  
Means, medians and confidence/credible intervals will be reported to one decimal plac e greater 
than the original data. The standard deviation will be reported to two decimal places greater than 
14 
 
CR-6305, Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0        Page 14 of 33  
VCT-0247 
 
  the original data. Minimum and maximum will use the same number of decimal places as the 
original data. P -values greater or equal than 0.0001 will be reported to 4 decimal places; p -values 
less than 0.0001 will be reported as “<0.0001”. All percentages will be reported to one decimal place. 
 
7.4. Sample Size Justification  
This study was designed and powered to show non- inferiority of the Test lens compared to the 
Control lens with respect to logMAR Visual Acuity, Slit Lamp Findings (Grade 3 or higher) and 
CLUE comfort. It was assumed there was no difference between the Test and Control lens with respect to slit lamp findings and a 1 letter difference (0.02) between the Test and Control lenses with respect to visual acuity logMAR. Based on data from 3 historical studies, it was assumed there was a 2 -point difference between the Test and Control lenses with respect to CLUE 
comfort based on the summary statistics from the first period of the historical studies.   In addition to the endpoints mentioned above this study was also powered to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Test lens relative to the Control lens with respect to vision satisfaction in bright lighting and the proportion of eyes with acceptable fitting while the Test lens is significantly 
superior to 90%.   Unless otherwise specified, the sample size was calculated to achieve a minimum statistical power of 80% and a type I error of 5%.   A total of 5 historical studies were utilized in the sample size ca lculation. Table 5 displays the 
studies, their corresponding study design and the number of subjects enrolled and completed per -
protocol.    Table 5: Historical Studies Included in Sample Size Calculation

for two sample means was used to Test for non -inferiority. A non-infe riority margin of -5 points 
was used since this is considered to be no more than a 10% shift in the distribution of CLUE scores.   
 
Mechanical Lens Fit (Test Lens)  
The estimated sample size to test the primary hypothesis (H0 P T ≤ P0, H1: P T > P0) is 100. The 
sample size was calculated using PROC POWER for one sample proportion using an exact Test of a Binomial Proportion.  
Visual Performance (logMAR)  
Sample size calculation for visual performance (logMAR) was carried out using an approximation of the power of an F -test derived from the non -centrality parameter calculated 
form the observed F statistic of a linear model
8. 
 Model details: visual performan ce was analyzed using a linear mixed model. Lens type was included as the only 
fixed effect.  A compound symmetric (CS) covariance matrix was used to model the correlation between measurements within the same subject.  Below is the variance- covariance matr ix used in 
the visual performance model.

  Slit Lamp Findings  
There were no Grade 3 or higher SLFs observed in any of the historical studies. Assuming  no 
difference between study lenses and  a correlation 0. 70 between left and right eyes within the 
same subject (intra-subject correlation),  a reference rate of no more than 5% was assumed 
(worse-case scenario) with a non -inferiority odds ratio margin of 2. A total of 2000 replicating 
trials were simulated , each replicated sample was analyzed using a gener alized estimating 
equation (GEE) model with a binary distribution and the logit as the link function. Each model included lens type as the only fixed, eye was included as a random effect. The Odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval was used es timate differences between the Test and 
Control lenses. The upper limit of each 95% confidence interval was compared to 2; if the upper limit was below 2 then NI=1; otherwise NI=0. Statistical power was calculated at the average NI. A sample size of 224 (112 per arm) was chosen to achieve a minimum statistical power of 80%.   
 Using a reference rate for the control that does not exceed 5% and no more than a 5% difference 
between the Test and Control lenses translates to an odds ratio margin of 2. A referenc e rate of 
5% was used since this is the worst- case scenario . 
 
Vision Satisfaction 
Vision satisfaction in bright lighting sample size estimate was  calculated using historical data 
. One-thousand boot strap sample s were simulated based on the his torical data. 
For each replicated sample a generalized linear mixed model was used with a multinomial distribution and the cumulative logit as the link function. Lens wear w as included in the model as 
the only fixed effects.  
 Using a reference rate of 0.50 for the Control lens and assuming no difference between the Test 
and Control a 10% difference translate to a cumulative odds ratio margin of 0.67. the reference rate of 0.50 was used since this is considered to be the worst- case scenario.

  As indicated in Table 10 and 11 above, the sample size chosen for this study was primary driven by Slit Lamp Findings (Grade 3 or higher) and CLUE Comfort.  The plan is to enroll 236 eligible 
subjects (118 subject per arm) with a target of 112 subjects to complete each arm in the study. During the enrollment period, the subject drop-out rate with be closely monitored, if an unexpectedly high dropout rate is observed, then the targeted total enrollment number maybe be increased accordingly to ensure that a minimum of 224 subjects complete the study.   
7.5. Statistical Significance Level  
All planned analysis will be conducted with an overall type I error rate of 5% . There will be 
neither adjustment for multiple tests nor adjustment for multiplicity of endpoints. Unless 
otherwise specified, all statistical tests will be 2 -sided. 
7.6. Handling of Missing Data and Drop- outs 
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed. The count of missing values will be included in 
the summary tables and listings.   Subject dropout is expected to be one of the main reasons of missing data in this clinical trial. Past clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not- at-random. 
To evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitivity analysis may be considered by automatically sampling all missing values and incorporating them in the Markov chain for the parameters using the PROC MCMC procedure.

VCT-0247 
 
  All the efficacy analyses will be conducted on PP population. As sensitivity analysis, the efficacy analysis will be repeated on the ITT population  
Visual Acuity 
Distance monocular visual acuity (logMAR) will be tested under bright illumination bright 
contrast conditions at the 2- week follow -up evaluation and will be analyzed using a Bayesian 
normal random-effects model to compare the Test and Control lenses. The regression model will include lens type as the only fixed effect. Clinical site and subject will be included as random effects. Other subject characteristics such as gender and age will be included as fixed effects when appropriate.   The Model: 
Let 
 the visual acuity (logMAR) for the 
  subject at the 
  site, assigned to the 
  lens 
for the 
  eye.  The likelihood for 
   is constructed as follows:  
 ~ N(
 ) 
Where,  
 = 
 + 
  +  
  + 
 
 
In this model, lens we define 
 =0 for the Control lens and 
 =1 for the Test lens. So 
  
stands for the difference between the Test and Control lens with respect to logMAR visual 
performance. A negative 
  indicates the Test performed better than the Control lens.  
 
We assume random subject  effects are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) as 
  N(0, 
 ) as random subject and , the random site effect is i.i.d as 
  ~ N(0, 
 ) for i=1,2 
(lens),  j=1, 2  (eye), k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (site).  
 For the β coefficients, independent non-informative priors N(0, 1000) will be used. For the 
variance of random effects 
and 
 independent non-informative conjugate priors 
inverse-gamma(0.001, 0.001) will be used. For 
 , non-informative conjugate priors inverse-
gamma(0.001, 0.001) will be used where 
 , is the variance of  
 . The metropolis sampler 
algorithm as implemented in the SAS/STAT MCMC 14.214 procedure will be used to estimate 
the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters. Inferences will be made based on the 95% 
posterior credible intervals for relevant parameters.  
 
Hypothesis Testing  
The null and alternative hypothesis for visual acuity (logMAR) to test for non- inferiority of the 
Test lens relative to the Control lens is as follows:  
 
≥ 0.05 
 
< 0.05 
 Non-inferiority will be declared if the upper limit of the 95% credible interval of the difference 
between the Test and Control is below 0.05, i.e. P(
< 0.05) ≥ 0.975. 
 
CLUE Overall Comfort  
21 
 
CR-6305, Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0        Page 21 of 33  
VCT-0247 
 
  CLUE Comfort scores will be analyzed using a Bayesian normal random- effects model to 
compare the Test and Control lenses at the 2 -week follow -up evaluation. The regression model 
will include baseline CLUE comfort scores and lens type as fixed effects. Clinical site will be included as random effects. Other subject characteristics such as age, gender, race and iris category will be included as fixed covariates when appropriate.  
 The Model:  
Let 
 denote the CLUE Comfort score for the 
  subject at the 
  site, assigned to the  
  
lens. The likelihood for 
   is constructed as follows:  
 ~ N(
 ) 
 
Where  
 = 
 +  
  + 
baseline + 
   
 
In this model, we define 
 =0 for the Control lens and 
  for the Test lens. So 
  
stands for the difference between the Test and Control lens with respect to CLUE comfort; A 
positive 
  indicates the Test performed better than the Control.  
 
We assume random site effects are independent  and identically distributed (i.i.d) as 
  ~ N(0, 
)  for site for j =1,  2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (site) . 
 
For the β coefficients, independent non- informative priors N(0, 1000) will be used. For the 
variance of random effect of 
  an independent non- informative conjugate prior, inverse -
gamma(0.001, 0.001) will be used. Starting values for the mean and variance of CLUE scores will be 60 and 400 (since standard deviation of CLUE is normalized to be 20), respectively. The Metropolis s ampler algorithm as implemented in the SAS/STAT MCMC 14.2
14 procedure will 
be used to estimate the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters. Inferences will be made based on the 95% posterior credible intervals for relevant parameters.   
Hypothesis Testing  
The null and alternative hypotheses for CLUE comfort non- inferiority of the Test lens relative to 
the Control lens are as follows:  
  
≤ -5 
 
 > -5 
 
Non-inferiority will be declared if the lower bo und of the 2-sided 95% credible interval of the 
difference between the Test lens and the Control lens is greater than -5, i.e., P(
  > -5) ≥ 0.975.  
 
Vision Satisfaction in Bright Lighting  
The response set will first be reversed in order to appropriately analyze the data in order to provide the odds ratio of having a higher rating with the Test compared to the Control lens. Vision satisfaction in bright lighting at the 2 -week follow -up evaluation will be analyzed using a 
Bayesian multinomial model for ordinal data.  The regression model will include lens type as the only fixed effect. Clinical site will be included as a random effect. Other subject characteristics such as age, gender, race an d iris category will be included when appropriate.

The Model: 
Let 
= (
 , 
 , 
, 
, 
) denote the rating for the 
  subject, from the 
  site, 
assigned to the 
  study lens. Possible values of 
  are 1if the subject rating of vision 
satisfaction in bright lighting are X and 0 otherwise (x=1 for Strongly Agree and X=5 for 
Strongly Disagree, respectively).  The likelihood is constructed as fol lows:

 ,

, 
, 
); 
 
-
  2 ≤ X ≤4  
 
Logit(
 )=

  +  
 
Where 
 is the intercept for levels X=1,2,3,4, We assume the random clinical site effects are 
i.i.d as 
~N(0, 
 ) for j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6(site) . 
In this model, w e define 
 =0 for the Control lens and 
 =1 for the Test l ens.  
Independent non- informative  N(0, 1000) priors for the regression coefficients 
 . For the 
variance of random effect of 
  an independent non-informative conjugate prior, inverse-
gamma(0.001, 0.001) will be used. For 
 , we are considering the following priors  
 
π0(θ1) ~ N(0,100) 
π0(θ2| θ1) ~ N(0,100)I( θ>θ1) 
π0(θ3| θ2) ~ N(0,100)I( θ>θ2) 
π0(θ4| θ3) ~ N(0,100)I( θ>θ3) 
 For the variance of random effects independent non- informative  normal priors will also be used; 
~inverse-gamma(0.001, 0.001). The Metropolis sample algorithm as implemented in the 
SAS/Stat MCMC Procedure will be used to estimate the posterior distributions of the unknown parameters. Inferences will be made based on the posterior credible interval  for the relevant 
parameters.  
 If few subjects  reported in categor y levels disagree and strongly disagree (less than 5%) ; the 
levels will be collapsed  into one category level.  
 
Hypothesis Testing 
The null and alternative hypotheses for non- inferiority are as follows:  
  
 ≤ -0.1 
 
  -0.1 
 
23 
 
CR-6305, Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0        Page 23 of 33  
VCT-0247 
 
  Where 
  are the proportions of patients with positive response (agree or strongly 
agree) in the Test group and Control group, respectively. Non -inferiority will be declared if the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% credible confidence interval is above -0.1 i.e. P(
  -
0.1)=0.975.  
Primary Safety Analysis:  
Safety analysis will be conducted on safety population by actual treatment recei ved by subjects.  
 
Acceptable Lens Fit:  
Acceptable lens fit will be analyzed using a Bayesian beta-binomial models for correlated binary 
data.  
 The Model: Let Y1 and Y2 denote the binary outcomes of acceptable lens fit for the left and right eyes, respectively, when wearing the test lens. Considering the correlation, ρ, between Y1 and Y2, the distribution of the sum Y = Y1 + Y2 is obtained by the mixture of two variables. One of them 
follow a binomial distribution Bin(2, p) with mixing probability ( 1-
) and the other one follows 
a modified Bernoulli distribution MBern(p), taking value 0 and 2 rather than conventional 0 and 
1, with mixing probability p:  
P(Y = y| p, ρ) = (1- ρ)Bin(2, p)I
A1 +  ρMBern(p)I A2 
Where I A1 = {0, 1, 2} and I A2 = {0, 2} 
 To overcome the complexity of the mixture likelihood a latent variable Z
i, i = 1, 2 is introduced 
in the model to indicate in which component of the model the observation y i, i=1, 2, belongs to, 
that is, 
 
 
 The joint distribution of the augmented da ta (Y
i, Zi), i=1, 2, is given by 
 
The posterior distribution of (p,
 ) given (y, z) is 
P (p, ρ | z, y)  = P (y, z| p, ρ) π0 (p, ρ), 
  Where, π
0 is joint prior distribution of (p, ρ). Here we assume p and ρ to be independent with a 
prior beta(α,β) for p and uniform(0,1) for ρ. Hence the joint distribution of (p, ρ) is given by π0 
(p, ρ| α, β) ∝ pα -1(1-p) β-1. The Metropolis sampler algorithm as implemented in the SAS/STAT 
MCMC Procedure will be used to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters ( p, ρ). 
Inferences will be made based on a posterior credible interval for the relevant parameters .  
 
Hypothesis Testing  
With respect to Acceptable lens fit the null and alternative hypothes is for superiority is  as 
follows: 
24 
 
CR-6305, Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0        Page 24 of 33  
VCT-0247 
 
  
 : 
 ≤ 0.90 
 : 
 > 0.90 
 Where, 
 represents the proportion of subject eyes that achieve acceptable fit for the Test  lens.  
Success for acceptable fit will be declared if the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% cred ible 
interval of the proportion is greater than 0.90; i.e. 
 .  
If the full planned model fails to converge, reduced versions may be considered.  
Slit Lamp Findings  
Grade 3 or higher slit lamp findings will be analyzed using a Bayesian Logistic regression random-effects model to compare the Test and Control lenses.  The regression model will include baseline slit lamp findings and lens type. Site and subject will be included in the model as random effects.  
 
Let 
=1 if a Grade 3 or higher SLF is observed and 
 0 otherwise for the 
  subject, 
from the 
  site, assigned to the 
  study lens for the 
 eye. 
 
 
 
 
 
We assume the random effect for subject are i.i.d as  
  for the random for clinical 
site are i.i.d as 
 ~N(0, 
 ) for i=1,2 (lens), j=1, 2 (eye), k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (site) and l=1,…n 
(subject/site).  
 
In this model, we define 
 =0 for the Control lens and 
 =1 for the Test lens.  
For the 
 coefficients, independent non- informative priors 
  will be used. For the 
variance of random effects  of 
  and
, independent non-informative conjugate priors 
inverse-gamma (0.001, 0.001) will be used . The Metropolis -Hastings algorithm as implemented 
in the SAS/STAT 1 4.2 PROC MCMC procedure will be used to estimate posterior distributions 
of the unknown parameters. Inferences will be made based on the posterior credible interval for 
the relevant parameters.  
 
Hypothesis Testing  
The null and alternative hypothesis for Non- inferiority is as follows:  
  
 ≥ 0.05 
 
 <  0.05 
 
Where 
 are the proportions of eyes with Grade or higher SLFs for the Test  group and 
Control group, respectively.  Non-inferiority will be established if the upper limit of the 2 -sided 
95% credible interval is below 5%, i.e. Pr(
 |y)=0.975.  
 
25 
 
CR-6305, Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0        Page 25 of 33  
VCT-0247 
 
  If the full planned model fails to converge, reduced versions may be considered. In the event that the number of Grade 3 or higher SLFs is too small Grade 2 or higher SLFs will be analyzed and tested as described above.

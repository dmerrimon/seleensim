ISORDER
(MDD)
Major
depressive
disorder
(MDD)
is
a
common
psychiatric
condition,
mostly
treated
with
antidepressant
drugs,
which
are
limited
for
issues
such
as
effectiveness
and
adverse
effects.
8.1.2
MDD
D
IAGNOSIS
The
diagnosis
of
MDD
is
based
on
the
diagnostic
criteria
in
the
Diagnostic
and
statistical
manual
of
mental
disorders
–
5th
edition
(DSM-V).
Patients
should
receive
a
thorough
diagnostic
assessment
in
order
to
establish
the
diagnosis
of
major
depressive
disorder,
identify
other
psychiatric
or
general
medical
conditions
that
may
require
attention.
The
psychiatrist
should
develop
a
comprehensive
plan
for
treatment.
This
evaluation
generally
includes
a
history
of
the
present
illness
and
current
symptoms
that
may
trigger
or
exacerbate
depressive
symptoms.
Several
clinically
validated
standard
scales
are
available
for
the
assessment
of
the
severity
of
depressive
symptoms.
Based
on
cut-offs
from
these
scales,
the
severity
of
MDD
can
be
classified
as
mild,
moderate,
and
severe.

Antidepressants
Antidepressants
are
psychiatric
drugs
used
for
the
treatment
of
MDD
and
other
conditions,
including
dysthymia,
anxiety
disorders,
OCD,
eating
disorders,
chronic
pain,
neuropathic
pain
and,
in
some
cases,
dysmenorrhea,
attention-deficit
hyperactivity
disorder,
addiction,
and
sleep
disorders.
They
may
be
prescribed
alone
or
in
combination
with
other
medications.
The
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC)
reported
that
antidepressant
usage
in
the
United
States
among
people
aged
12
or
more
years
rose
by
400%
between
1988-1994
and
2005-2008.
Antidepressants
are
given
to
improve
depressive
symptoms.
There
are
several
types
of
antidepressants,
depending
to
the
main
neurotransmitter
system
they
target:
●
Selective
Serotonin
Reuptake
Inhibitors
(SSRIs)
and
Serotonin
and
Noradrenaline
Reuptake
Inhibitors
(SNRIs):
SSRIs
and
SNRIs
block
the
reuptake
of
serotonin
or
serotonin
and
noradrenaline
in
the
brain.
SSRIs
are
more
widely
prescribed
than
SNRIs,
are
effective
in
treating
depression,
and
have
fewer
side-effects
than
older
antidepressant
classes

2
.
SSRIs
and
SNRIs
may
have
the
following
side
effects:
hypoglycemia,
low
sodium,
nausea,
rash,
dry
mouth,
constipation,
diarrhea,
weight
loss,
sweating,
tremor,
sedation,
sexual
dysfunction,
insomnia,
headache,
dizziness,
anxiety,
agitation,
and
abnormal
thinking.
●
Monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
(MAOIs)
:
MAOIs
inhibit
the
action
of
monoamine
oxidase,
the
enzyme
that
breaks
down
monoaminergic
neurotransmitter
(e.g.,
serotonin,
noradrenaline),
thus
increasing
their
levels
in
the
brain.
MAOIs
are
usually
prescribed
as
second-line
antidepressants
as
they
present
several
side
effects
including
blurred
vision,
rash,
seizures,
edema,
weight
disturbances,
sexual
dysfunction,
diarrhea,
nausea,
constipation,
anxiety,
insomnia,
drowsiness,
headache,
dizziness,
arrhythmia,
fainting
and
hypertension.
●
Noradrenaline
and
Specific
Serotonergic
Antidepressants
(NASSAs):
This
class
of
antidepressants
block
adrenergic
and
specific
serotonergic
receptors.
NASSAs
have
the
following
side
effects:
constipation,
dry
mouth,
weight
gain,
drowsiness,
sedation,
blurred
vision,
and
dizziness.
More
serious
adverse
reactions
include
seizures,
white
blood
cell
reduction,
fainting,
and
allergic
reactions.
●
Tricyclic
Antidepressants
(TCA):
This
is
the
oldest
class
of
antidepressants
which
are
not
typically
used
as
first-line
treatment
because
they
have
a
less
favorable
tolerability
and
safety
profile
than
more
recent
antidepressants.
TCAsmay
have
the
following
side
effects:
seizures,
insomnia,
anxiety,
arrhythmia,
hypertension,
rash,
nausea,
vomiting,
abdominal
cramps,
weight
loss,
constipation,
urinary
retention,
eye
pressure,
and
sexual
dysfunction.
Current
practice
for
selecting
pharmacological
antidepressant
treatments
are
limited
by
low
response
and
remission
rates
in
MDD.
The
UK
National
Institute
for
Health
and
Care
Excellence
(NICE)
CG90
guidelines
3
indicate
that
antidepressants
should
not
be
routinely
used
for
the
initial
treatment
of
mild
depression,
because
the
risk-benefit
ratio
is
poor.
Antidepressant
treatment
should
be
considered
for
people
with
a
history
of
moderate
or
severe
depression,
and
for
those
with
mild
depression
that
has
been
present
for
a
long
period.
The
guidelines
further
note
that
antidepressant
treatment
should
be
used
in
combination
with
psychosocial
interventions,
should
be
continued
for
at
least
six
months
to
reduce
the
risk
of
relapse,
and
that
SSRIs
are
typically
better
tolerated
than
other
antidepressants

recommend

choice
in
people
with
mild
or
moderate
major
depression
and
should
be
given
to
all
patients
with

Moreover,
treatment
should
be
individually
tailored
and
should
consider
all
available
options
that
may
include
pharmacotherapy
(other
symptomatic
treatments),
psychotherapy,
ECT,
TMS
or
tDCS.
8.1.3.2
Psychological
Treatments
Many
psychological
treatments
are
available
for
MDD.
These
include
but
not
limited
to,
psychoeducation,
supportive
psychotherapy,
various
group
and
individual
therapies.
Common
components
of
these
treatments
involve
(a)
information
about
the
disorder
and
its
treatment;
(b)
practical
support;
(c)
support
for
improving
family
communication;
and
(d)
improving
social
and
problem-solving
skills
and
addressing
maladaptive
patterns
of
thinking
about
themselves
and
others
6
.
The
two
most
common
structured
psychological
interventions
are
cognitive-behavioral
therapy
(CBT)
and
interpersonal
therapy
(IPT)
that
target
maladaptive
thoughts
and
behaviors
using
different
techniques.
A
further
psychological
approach
is
psychodynamic
psychotherapy
(PDT)
which
is
based
on
the
principles
of
psychoanalysis.
It
aims
to
help
patients
increase
awareness
of
their
internal
thoughts
and
patterns
of
behavior
which
might
be
contributing
to
their
condition.
Psychotherapy
is
considered
a
reasonable
alternative
to
medication
for
mild
depression
and
as
an
adjunct
treatment
in
more
severe
depression
where
it
can
enhance
response
and
reduce
relapse
7
,
8
,
9
.
However,
psychological
interventions
require
the
active
participation
of
patients
as
well
as
access
to
specialist
therapies
which
might
limit
their
real-world
availability
and
efficacy.
8.1.3.3
Electroconvulsive
Therapy
(ECT)
Electroconvulsive
therapy
(ECT)
is
also
referred
to
as
electroshock
or
shock
treatment
mainly
in
the
lay
literature.
During
ECT,
an
electrical
current
is
passed
through
the
brain
to
produce
an
epileptic
fit
(otherwise
known
as
convulsion
or
seizure).
To
minimize
any
discomfort,
ECT
is
administered
under
general
anesthesia.
The
current
strength
for
ECT
is
usually
around
800mA,
which
is
400
times
higher
than
the
current
used
for
tDCS.
Immediately
after
treatment,
many
patients
experience
headache,
muscle
aches
and
temporary
amnesia

and
was
initially
used
for
a
variety
of
mental
health
disorders
conditions.
Currently
it

used
mainly
in
patients
with
treatment-resistant

A

Transcranial
Magnetic
Stimulation
(TMS)
Transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
(TMS)
is
a
noninvasive
procedure
approved
for
the
treatment
of
depression
in
Europe,
Australia,
and
the
US
10
.
TMS
is
typically
reserved
for
patients
that
have
shown
minimal
or
partial
response
to
antidepressants
and
for
patients
for
whom
antidepressant
treatment
is
not
suitable.
Each
treatment
session
involves
placing
a
purpose-made
electromagnetic
coil
against
the
scalp
in
order
to
induce
electric
currents
in
the
brain
using
repetitive
magnetic
pulses,
hence
the
name
repetitive
TMS
(rTMS).
The
treatment
requires
specialist
equipment
and
medical
supervision
and
is
therefore
not
suitable
for
home
use.
8.1.3.5
Cranial
Electrotherapy
Stimulation
(CES)
Cranial
electrotherapy
stimulation
(CES)
(also
referred
to
as
cranial
electrostimulation,
electrosleep
therapy,
and
electronarcosis)
is
a
non-pharmacological,
non-invasive
treatment
in
which
low-intensity
electrical
current
is
applied
to
the
scalp.
The
main
difference
from
tDCS
is
that
CES
uses
alternating
current
(AC)
rather
than
direct
current
(DC)
electricity.
There
is
currently
a
wide
variety
of
CES
devices.
The
Fisher
Wallace
Stimulator
is
a
CES
device
which
has
FDA-approval
for
the
treatment
of
anxiety,

8.1.3.6
Transcranial
Direct
Current
Stimulation
(tDCS)
Flow
is
based
on
transcranial
direct
current
stimulation
(tDCS),
a
non-invasive
brain
stimulation
technique
where
a
weak
direct
current
is
applied
on
the
scalp
through
electrodes.
The
current
modulates
the
underlying
neural
activity.
In
principle,
tDCS
electrodes
can
be
placed
anywhere
on
the
scalp.
Changes
in
the
tDCS
electrode
placement,
also
called
montage,
change
the
distribution
of
the
induced
electrical
fields
in
the
brain.
Different
montages
are
used
depending
on
the
indication.
Empirical
evidence
indicates
that
a
montage
that
targets
the
prefrontal
cortex
can
reduce
depression
symptoms
(see

3.1.3
of

Neuromodulation
is
a
technique
that
alters
neural
activity
through
the
targeted
delivery
of
chemical
or
electrical
stimulus.
In
particular,
brain
neuromodulation
may
be
achieved
through
the
direct
application
of
stimulation
via
implanted
deep
brain
stimulation
(DBS)
or
non-invasively
by
TMS,
CES
or
tDCS.
Direct
and
non-invasive
therapies
have
been
tested
for
neurologic
disorders
such
as
Parkinson’s
disease,
schizophrenia,
chronic
pain,
and
MDD,
with
MDD
being
the
most
studied
disorder
(Brunoni
et
al.
2010).
TMS
to
the
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex
(DLPFC)
is
shown
in
the
literature
to
be
safe
and
effective
in
treating
MDD
and
as
a
result
has
received
FDA
clearance
for
MDD
treatment
(Cole
et.
al.,
2019).
TMS
has
proven
to
be
commercially
viable,
however
the
treatment
has
some
limitations.
The
limitations
of
TMS
include
the
expensive
capital
equipment
required
for
the
delivery
of
treatment,
which
can
only
be
delivered
with
specialist
training.
Patients
being
treated
with
TMS
are
required
to
attend
multiple
clinic
visits,
sometimes
daily
or
multiple
times
daily,
for
weeks
at
a
time,
depending
on
their
prescription.
Building
from
the
understanding
of
the
mechanisms,
effects
and
targeting
from
TMS
therapy,
and
removing
some
of
the
logistical
hurdles
that
prevent
access
to
TMS
therapy,
it
is
the
intent
of
this
study
to
investigate
whether
the
area
of
the
brain
that
is
being
modulated
by
TMS
treatment
can
be
similarly
modulated
by
a
home-use

APP
The
Flow
app
is
used
to
control
the
Bluetooth
connected
Flow
tDCS
headset
and
acquire
data
about
its
use.
The
app
is
connected
to
a
server
that
stores
all
data
in
a
secure
PostgreSQL
database.
For
the
trial,
a
dedicated
installation
of
the
server
and
app
will
be
used
to
isolate
all
trial
data
from
data
collected
from
retail
Flow
users.
Trial
participants
will
be
given
a
link
to
the
dedicated
trial
app
(Google
Play
or
Apple
App
store)
before
starting
the
trial.
In
the
trial
app,
participants
register
with
their
email.
No
other
identifying
information
is
collected
in
the
app.
Only
the
Flow
research
team
and
Curebase
will
be
able
to
log
in
to
the
Flow
trial
system
and
database
and
view
the
participant
emails.
During
the
trial,
the
user
will
answer
the
nine
questions
of
the
MADRS-s
form
in
the
app.
Answering
the
form
is
mandatory
to
continue
with
the
stimulation.
The
app
also
continuously
sends
headset
usage
data
to
the
server.
The
trial
personnel
(at
Curebase
and
at
the
sites
in
the
UK
and
US)
will
have
access
to
an
administrative
web
interface
where
it
can
follow
how
much
and
when
users
have
stimulated.
This
way
they
can
monitor
the
usage
of
each
patient
and
contact
them
if
they
start
to
miss
sessions.
This
retention
management
is
in
addition
to
the
normal

Small
skin

are
also
known
from
the
literature
due
to
the
use
of
tap
water
instead
of
physiological
saline
to
wet
the

electrodes
11
.
Therefore,
Flow
is
delivered
with
disposable
pre-moistened
sponges
so
that
the
users
do
not
need
to
handle
saline
themselves.
The
tDCS
studies
in
participants
with
MDD
have
reported
mostly
consistent
adverse
events
with 
large
studies
on
healthy
participants
12
.
In
addition
to
this,
there
have
been
four
studies
that
have 
published
the
appearance
of
treatment-emergent
mania/hypomania
(TEM)
in
eleven
cases
total
13
. 
Most
cases
of
TEM
have
been
where
tDCS
has
been
combined
with
antidepressant
drugs,
which 
are
known
to
increase
the
risk
of
a
manic
switch
14
.
As
such,
a
causal
relationship
has
not
been 
determined.
The
observed
cases
have
also
been
mild
and
in
general
not
required
any
intervention 
(correspondence
with
authors).
In
the
internal
data
from
over
3,000
Flow
FL-100
users,
no 
instance
of
TEM
has
been
discovered
or
reported.
In
accordance
with
the
recommendation
from 
Antal
et
al.
(2017),
participants
with
a
history
of
bipolar
disorder
will
be
excluded
from
this
study 
due
to
their
increased
risk
of

We
expect
the
Flow

over
80%
report
having
some

around
30%
reach

It

although
there
may
be
a

There

Flow
also
gives

access
to
a
type
of

that
is
in

only
available

The

active
and
sham.
The
participants
will
be
divided
equally
between
the
arms
and
will
not
be
informed
of
their

will
be
informed
during
the

that
some
of
them
will
have
sham
stimulation
during
their
initial
10-week

depending
on
their

assignment.
The
sham
group
receives
sham
stimulation
following
how
sham
tDCS
is
normally
implemented
in

At
the
beginning
of
each
30-minute

session,
the
current
is
ramped
up
to
1mA
over
30
seconds.
However,
when
it
has
reached
its
maximum,
it
is
again
slowly
ramped
down
to

By
the
end
of
the
session,

Investigator
will
ask
the
reason
for
their
withdrawal
and
will
record
all
information
regarding
the
participant
discontinuation.
A
Participant
may
be
withdrawn
from
the
clinical
investigation
for
the
following
reasons:
●
Participants
may
choose
to
withdraw
from
the
clinical
investigation
under
the
terms
of
the
Declaration
of
Helsinki
and
their
consent
documentation
without
having
to
give
a
reason;
●
Any
unanticipated
adverse
event
which,
in
the
opinion
of
the
Principal
Investigator,
is
related
to
the
treatment
and
will
endanger
the
well-being
of
the
participant
if
treatment
is
continued;
●
Development
of
any
intercurrent
illness(es),
infection
or
condition(s)
that
might
interfere
with
the
clinical
investigation;
●
Non-compliance
with
the
clinical
investigation
procedures
deemed
by
the
Principal
Investigator
to
be
sufficient
to
cause
discontinuation;
●
Any
problem
deemed
by
the
Investigator
to
be
sufficient
to
cause
discontinuation.
Participants
will
be
withdrawn
from
the
trial
if
they
do
not
comply
with
the
intervention,
namely
if
they
are
unable
to
have
a
minimum
of
60%
of
the
tDCS
session
(22
(660
minutes)
out
of
36
sessions
at
week
10)
during
the
blinded
phase,
or
if
they
develop
serious
adverse
effects
from
any
part
of
the
study.
Recording
of
the
reasons
for
withdrawal
will
be
made.
Their
GP
will
be
informed
about
their
withdrawal,
and
they
will
have
a
telephone
follow
up
at
1
month
following
their
withdrawal.
If
a
participant
is
withdrawn,
their
device
is

Kaplan-Meier

characterize
device
failure
time.
Device
failure
in
this
study
is
defined
as
the
device
not
operating
as
intended
without
unexpected
failure.
Unexpected
failure
is
defined
as
a
failure
that
is
not
related
to
device
functionality.
For
example,
the
device
accidentally
falling
out
of
a
window
would
be
categorized
as
an
unexpected
device
failure.
In
contrast,
the
device
failing
to
turn
on
would
be
considered
an
expected
device
failure.
As
the
device
is
not
expected
to
have
any
unexpected
failures,
unexpected
failures
will
only
be
reported
if
they
occur.
Lifetables
will
be
tabulated
indicating
the
number
of
“failures''
and
the
number
of
“at-

subjects
over
time
for
all
failures,
unexpected

and

If
there

All
changes
to
the
protocol
that
impact
validity
of
data,
scientific
soundness,
the
rights
safety,
or
welfare
of
the
participants,
must
be
documented
in
the
format
of
an
amendment
with
justification
statements
in
the
cover
letter
to
the
IRB/EC
and
FDA.
All
amendments
must
be
submitted
to
the
IRB/EC
and
regulatory
authority
for
review
and
approval.
Following
approval,
the

a
21
CFR
Part
11
compliant
electronic
data
capture
(EDC)
system
for
each
patient
enrolled
into
the
clinical
study.
The
study
coordinator
will
enter
the
source
data
onto
the
eCRFs,
and
study
monitors
will
verify
that
the
source
documents
match
the
eCRFs.
Once
verified,
the
study
monitor
will
lock
the
field
via
a
monitoring
approval
step
so
the
data
cannot
be
changed
unless
requested.
All
procedures
for
the
handling
and
analysis
of
data
will
be
conducted
using
good
clinical
data
management
practices
within
systems
meeting
FDA
guidelines
for
the
handling,
storage,
and
analysis
of
data
for
clinical
studies.
The
Investigator
will
sign
off
on
the

eCRFs
and
will
sign
each
patient’s
casebook
once
the
patient
completes
the
study
to
attest
that
all
data
entered
on
the
eCRFs
are
complete
and
accurate.
All
of
the
above
signatures
will
be
completed
digitally
within
the
EDC
system
using
the
system’s
Part
11
compliant
digital
signature
system
function.
Any
required
data
clarifications
will
be
handled
within
the
EDC
system’s
query
management
system.
The
EDC
will
be
programmed
to
automatically
place
data
clarification
queries
on
missing
values
and
values
out
of
acceptable
ranges.
Study
monitors
and
data
managers
will
also
be
able
to
add
data
clarification
queries
to
data
points
within
the
system.
Study
coordinators
will
have
the
opportunity
to
correct

and/or
respond
to
the

for
review
by
monitors
and

Means and standard deviations  were calculated  for each of the p atient characteristics.   The statistical 
significance of differences between THRIVE and non -THRIVE patients was assessed using a  t-test for all 
patient characteristics except gender, where a chi -square text was used.   No adjust ments were made  to 
the statistical s ignificance threshold for multiple comparisons, and our results should be viewed as 
exploratory.

You are  being asked  to take  part in this research study  because  you suffered a  critical  illness and were  in an 
intensive  care  unit (ICU).   Research studies are  voluntary and include  only people  who choose  to take  part.   
Please  read this consent  form  carefully and  take  your time making your decision.   As your study doctor or study 
staff discusses this  consent  form  with you, please  ask him/her to  explain any words or information  that you do not  
clearly understand.  We  encourage  you to  talk with your family and  friends  before  you decide  to take  part in this 
research study.  The  nature  of the  study,  risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and  other important  information 
about  the study are  listed below.  Please  tell the  study doctor or study staff   if you are  taking part  in another  
research study.
A grant  from  the National  Center for Complimentary and Integrative  Health  (NCCIH) will  sponsor this study.  
Portions of  Dr. Christopher  Cox’s and his  research team’s  salaries  will be paid by this grant.  We will recruit  
participants from  Duke  University Medical  Center (DUMC) over approximately twelve  months from  the time of 
study initiation.  
Who will  be my doctor  on this study?
If you decide  to participate, Dr. Christopher Cox will  be your doctor for  the study and will  be in contact  with 
your regular  health  care  provider throughout  the time that  you are  in the study and afterwards,  if needed.
Why is  this study being  done?
The purpose  of this study is  to find better  ways to  help people  who have  been  patients  in an ICU deal  with stress 
and both physical  and emotional  difficulties  that occur  following  discharge  from  the hospital.
How many people  will take  part in  this study?
Approximately 200 people  will take  part in this study at  different  hospitals and  medical  facilities.  We will  recruit  
approximately 90 participants from  Duke  University Medical  Center (DUMC) over approximately twelve  months 
from  the time  of study  initiation.  
What is  involved in  this study?
If you agree  to be in this study, you will  be asked to  sign and date  this consent  form.   You will  be randomly 
assigned (like  drawing straws) to  one of three  groups.  Of the  90 people  enrolled, 35 people  will be in Group 1, 35 
people  in group 2, and 20 people  in Group  3. You will  be told to  which  group you are  assigned.   If you are  in 
Group 1, you will receive  the mindfulness-based training telephone  program. This program  is a series of 4 short  
(30 minutes)  telephone  calls  that will be scheduled weekly according to  your  convenience.  During these  calls, a  
trained professional  will provide  training in  mindfulness techniques for stress and  symptom  management  such as  
relaxation, activity pacing, and communication.  If you are  in Group 2, you will  receive  the mobile  mindfulness 
training program  (mMBT), which is  delivered via  a website  designed  for mobile  devices. This program  will be 
self-directed via  a website  accessible  from  a computer,  tablet, or phone. This program  will provide  training  in 
mindfulness techniques for  stress  and symptom  management  such as  relaxation, activity  pacing, and 
communication. You will  also receive  brief weekly surveys to  fill out within the  website  so that  we can measure  
your progress. You will  be contacted by our trained interventionists by phone  for an  initial  session  and then only 
as needed  depending on your  progress  or if  you request  an additional  session. If you are  in Group  3, you will  
participate  in a critical  illness education program.  You will  receive  educational  handouts and  access to  videos that  
provide  information about  acute  respiratory failure.  You will  also receive  2 brief, check-in calls  from  a member  
of our study  team to  provide  additional  support  and answer any questions.
Those  in all groups will  participate  in three  telephone  interviews and  one in-person interview identical  in content  
and timing.   In these  interviews you will  complete  questionnaires asking about  your  mood, anxiety  level, and your

understanding about  your  medical  care.  These  interviews will  take  no more  than thirty minutes to  complete.  The  
interviews will  be conducted  at enrollment  in the hospital  and then within 1 week of your arrival  home, 6 weeks, 
and 3 months after you return home  from  the hospital.
If you are  willing, we  will audio record certain telephone  calls:  1) during the  final  telephone  interview to  ask 
about  your  impression  of the  telephone  program  and its usefulness and  2) during periodic  mindfulness training 
telephone  sessions for quality assurance  purposes.  We will  not audio record you if  you do not  want  us to  do so.  
This recording is  purely for research purposes and your identity will  be kept  completely  confidential.  No one  
other than the  research team will  have  access to  these  recordings.  The  recordings will  be labeled with a  unique  
number.  Any link  to your name  will be kept  in a secured file.   All  personal  identifiers will  be removed from  the 
audio-recordings at the  time of transcription.  All  recordings will  be stored  securely  (on a  password protected 
computer file  on a  secure  server to  which only the  researchers associated with the  study will  have  access to).  The  
audio-recordings will  be destroyed at  the completion of the  study. The  option to  allow  this audio  recording is  
completely voluntary and will  not affect  eligibility to  participate  in the study.   To indicate  whether or not  you 
permit  these  select  phone  calls  to be audio recorded, please  initial  on the  line that best matches your choice:
_____   I agree  to be audio recorded  during the  final  telephone  interview and during telephone  mindfulness  
training sessions 
_____   I DO NOT  agree  to be audio  recorded  during the  final  telephone  interview or during telephone  
mindfulness training sessions.
If you are  in Group 2, we  will be texting you reminders  to complete  mindfulness sessions or weekly  surveys.  
Texting may  be convenient  but does not  provide  a completely secure  and confidential  means of communication.  
Please  initial  on the  line below if  you wish to  keep your reminders private  and we  will communicate  with you 
through regular channels like  the telephone  or email:
_____  I choose  to OPT  OUT  of text reminders
How long will  I be  in this study?
Your participation in  the study will  last approximately 6 months from  the time you sign the  consent  form. We will  
interview you at  four different  time points:  
•Hospital  Interview:  within 24 hours of  enrollment
•Interview 1:   approximately 1 week  after returning home, either by phone  or electronically
•Interview 2:   approximately 6 weeks after  returning  home, either by phone  or electronically
•Interview 3:   approximately 3 months  after returning home, either by phone  or electronically
Your participation is  voluntary;  you can  choose  to stop  participating at any  time without  penalty or loss  of any  
benefits to  which you are  entitled.  However, if  you decide  to stop participating in  the study, we  encourage  you to  
talk to the study doctor  (Dr. Christopher Cox) first.  
We will  record information from  your medical  chart  such  as demographic  information,  insurance, laboratory test  
results, and other information relevant  to your sickness  and treatment.  By  signing this consent  document,  you 
agree  to our collection of this information.  No travel  or additional  blood tests or x-rays are  required of  you.   If 
you do not  want  to participate  in this study, there  will be no penalty or loss of benefits  to which  you are  entitled.

What are  the risks  of this study?
There  are no known physical  risks  associated with this study.  There  is, however, the  potential  risk of loss  of 
confidentiality.  Every effort  will be made  to keep your  information  confidential, however, this cannot  be 
guaranteed.  Some  of the  questions we  will ask you as  part of this study may  make  you feel  uncomfortable  or 
cause  emotional  distress.  You may  refuse  to answer any of the  questions and you may  take  a break  at any time 
during the  study.  You may  stop your  participation  in this study at  any time.
Because  e-mail  and text  messages  do not  provide  a completely secure  and confidential  means  of communication, 
please  do not  use email or text  messages if  you wish to  keep your communication private.   Instead,  please  let us 
know and we  will communicate  with you only through regular channels like  the telephone.
The website  used in  this study is  developed  by an  outside  party specifically for  use in this study.   As with any  
website  that you visit  or software  that you download,  there  may  be potential  security  risks and Duke  cannot  
guarantee  that the website/software  is free of risk.  In general, it is  recommended that  you run  a current  operating 
system  (OS) on your computer, review the  privacy/security settings on your web  browsers, run antivirus software, 
make  sure  that your connection is  encrypted (look for the  lock icon  when you connect), and  log off of websites  
when you are  done.  When viewing the  website  on a  mobile  device  or tablet,  it is recommended that  you run  a 
current  operating system  (OS) on your  device,  review  the privacy/security settings often, and  restrict  any 
unnecessary access.  If  you do not  have  an unlimited  data/text  plan, you may  incur additional  charges.
We are  not asking you to  make  any health decisions based on the  use of this website.   You should discuss  health 
decisions directly with your healthcare  provider.
As with all  technology, we  ask you to  wait  until  you are  in a safe environment, use  good judgment  and follow 
prevailing laws. Do not  perform  study-related activities  while  you are  driving.
Are there  benefits  to taking  part in  this study?
If you agree  to take  part in this study, there  may  be no direct  medical  benefit  to you.  Your responses to  the 
surveys and interviews will  not affect  the clinical  care  you receive.  If you are  in any Group, we  anticipate  that the 
study  may  reduce  distress and improve  your satisfaction with your ICU care, the  communication  you have  with 
doctors, and possibly the  process  of recovery after  critical  illness—though this  is not certain.  We hope  the 
information learned  from  this study  will benefit  other  persons who receive  care  in an ICU in  the future.   
Are there  alternatives to  taking  part in  this study?
You are  free to choose  not to participate  in this study.   You will  continue  to receive  regular clinical  care  
regardless of  whether  or not  you choose  to participate.
Will my information be  kept  confidential?
Study records that  identify  you will  be kept  confidential  as required by law. Federal  Privacy Regulations provide  
safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access. Except  when required by law  or for  your care, you will  
not be identified by name,  social  security number, address,  telephone  number,  or any other  direct  personal  
identifier in  study records disclosed outside  of Duke  University Health  System  (DUHS).  For records disclosed 
outside  of DUHS, you will  be assigned a  unique  code  number. The  key to  the code  will be kept  securely at 
DUHS.
Your records  may  be reviewed  in order  to meet federal  or state  regulations.  Reviewers may  include  
representatives of  the DUHS Institutional  Review Board.  If this group reviews your research  record, they  may

also need to  review your  entire  medical  record. The  study results will  be retained in  your research  record  for at 
least six years after  the study is  completed,  with the  exception of the  audio recordings, which will  be destroyed at 
the completion of  the study. At  that time either  the research  information not  already in  your medical  record will  be 
destroyed or information identifying you will  be removed  from  such study results at  DUHS.  Any research 
information in  your medical  record will  be kept  indefinitely. 
While  the information and  data  resulting from  this study may  be presented at  scientific  meetings or published in  a 
scientific  journal, your identity will  not be revealed.  This information may  be further  disclosed  by the  sponsor of 
this study, the  National  Center for Complimentary and Integrative  Health  (NCCIH). If  disclosed by the  sponsor, 
the information is  no longer covered by the  federal  privacy regulations. If this information  is disclosed to  outside  
reviewers for audit  purposes,  it may  be further  disclosed  by them  and may  not be covered by the  federal  privacy  
regulations.
What are  the costs?
There  will be no additional  costs to  you as  a result  of being in  this study.

hours and at 919-358-6451 after hours, on weekends  and holidays.
What about my rights to  decline  participation or  withdraw from the  study?
You may  choose  not to be in the study,  or, if  you agree  to be in the study, you may  withdraw  from  the study at 
any time.  If you withdraw from  the study, no new data  about  you will  be collected for study purposes other than  
data needed to  keep track of  your withdrawal.  Your decision not  to participate  or to  withdraw from  the study will  
not involve  any penalty or loss of benefits to  which you are  entitled, and  will not affect  your access to  health care  
at Duke. 
If you do decide  to withdraw, we  ask that you contact  Dr. Christopher Cox in  writing and let  him know that  you 
are withdrawing from  the study.  His address is  DUMC,  Division of  Pulmonary and Critical  Care  Medicine, Box 
102043, Durham, NC  27710.   We will  tell you about  new information that  may  affect  your health, welfare, or 
willingness to  stay in  this study.  Your doctor may  decide  to take  you off this  study if  your  condition gets worse, 
if you have  serious side  effects, or  if your study doctor determines that  it is no longer in  your best  interest  to 
continue.  The  sponsor or regulatory  agencies may  stop this study at any time  without  your consent.  Reasons why

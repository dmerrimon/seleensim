 1.0 Background, Rationale and Context  
 
In preparation for a full-scale randomized clinical trial ( RCT) of an internet -
delivered positive affect (PA)  intervention for young adult cancer survivors, the 
EMPOWER study  will collect pilot data on the feasibility and acceptability of a 
theoretically -driven, empirically -grounded, individual intervention to promote 
positive affect  (PA).1 An innovative, intervention for HIV patients (Lessons in 
Linking Affect and Coping: LILAC) will be adapted for  use with young adult cancer 
survivors. This intervention teaches eight cognitive and behavioral skills to 
enhance PA, which may broaden and enhance an individual’s resources for 
adapting to stressful events.2 Feasibility and acceptability data will be collected 
with reports of daily positive and negative affect, general and d omain -specific 
health -related quality of life, psychological well -being, and health behaviors. This 
will provide data to support further intervention studies, including an R01 proposal 
of a full -scale randomized clinical trial.  
 
The number of people surviv ing cancer and even thriving with cancer grows 
annually.  Historically, positive adjustment and growth in cancer has received little 
attention compared to impairment, disability and psychosocial morbidity.  Today, 
this important area of research is demonst rating increased growth and interest 
3,4,5,6.7 with significant potential app lications for cancer control and population 
sciences.   8   
 
A number of different psychosocial interventions have proven effective with cancer 
patients. The majority of these interventions are gr oup-based and focus on 
alleviating the psychosocial burden of cancer by reducing or managing 
psychological distress.9-12 Few interventions explicitly target PA. However, such 
interventions show promise for not only reducing the negative psychosocial impact  
of cancer and its treatment but for enhancing its positive psychosocial impact as 
well.13-16 A potential limiting factor of these PA interventions is that they are 
primarily group interventions targeted towards advanced cancer patients. Little is 
known ab out individualized PA interventions for cancer patients or survivors, but 
emerging and innovative research of a PA intervention for newly diagnosed HIV 
patients17-18 may have applications for cancer patients. Guided by Fredrickson’s 
broaden -and-build theor y of positive emotions22 and funded by the NIMH 
(R01MH084723), Moskowitz’s RCT of a 5 -session evidence -based intervention is 
designed to teach skills for increasing the frequency and intensity of daily PA and 
to examine the intervention’s effects on subseq uent psychological well -being, 
health behaviors, and physical health after diagnosis with HIV. Patients with HIV 
experience similar negative and positive psychosocial sequelae as patients with 
cancer.19-22 This manualized web -based and home -delivered inter vention (LILAC) 
focused explicitly on increasing positive affect, and has shown good feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in people coping with significant health -
related stress  23,24  including women with advanced breast cancer. Thus, 
Mosko witz’ empirically -based PA intervention research may have beneficial

 parallels to inform this current project. In this application, we propose to build on 
this prior work to adapt the LILAC intervention to improve health -related quality of 
life (HRQOL) for  young adult survivors of cancer.  
2.0 Objectives  
 
2.1 Primary Objectives  
 
2.1.1  To adapt an individualized positive affect intervention that was 
developed for newly diagnosed HIV patients to use with young adult 
cancer survivors . 
 
2.1.2  To pilot test the positive affect intervention with young adult cancer 
survivors to determine its feasibility and acceptability.   
 
2.2 Secondary Objective  
 
2.2.1  To describe health related quality of life, psychological well -being , and 
health behaviors in young adult cancer survivors  
3.0 Study Population  
 
60 young adult cancer survivors will be recruited through  the Comprehensive 
Cancer Center of Wake Forest University  (N=40) and the Robert H. Lurie 
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (N=20) .   
 
All patient s will meet the following inclusion criteria:  
 Able to read and understand English  
 Past history of a cancer diagnosis (excluding basal cell skin carcinoma)  
 15 to 39 years of age at diagnosis  of first cancer  and currently between 
the ages of 18 -39 
 Within 0 -5 years post -active treatment  for initial diagnosis or recurrence  
 Wireless internet connection or a home computer that is connected to the 
interne t 
 
Exclusion criteria:  
 Currently receiving palliative or hospice care  
 Significant psychiatric history  
 
We anticipate a large percentage of our target sample to have active 
mywakehealth accounts, and we plan to use the secure MyChart portal to send 
study information to potentially eligible patients to gauge their interest in the 
study and communicate as nece ssary with consented participants.

4.0 Methods  
 
4.1 Registration Procedures  
All patients entered on any CCCWFU trial, whether treatment, companion, 
or cancer control trial, must be registered with the CCCWFU Protocol 
Registrar or entered into ORIS Screening Log within 24 hours of Informed 
Consent. Patients must  be registered prior to the initiation of treatment.   
 
You must perform the following steps i n order to ensure prompt 
registration of your patient : 
 
1. Complete the Eligibility Checklist ( Appendix B ) 
2. Complete the Protocol Registration Form ( Appendix A)  
3. Alert the Cancer Center registrar by phone, and then  send the signed 
Informed Consent Form, Eligibility Checklist and Protocol Registration 
Form to the registrar, either by fax or e -mail.  
 
           
*Protocol Registration is open from 8:30 AM - 4:00 PM, Monday -
Friday.  
 
4. Fax/e-mail ALL eligibility source documents with registration. Patients 
will not  be registered without all required supporting documents.  
Note: If labs were performed at an outside institution, provide a printout of 
the results. Ensure that the most recent lab values are sent.  
 
To complete the registration process, the Registrar will:    
 
 assign a patient study number  
 register the patient on the study  
 
4.2 Study Design  
Patients  will be recruited through RHLCCC and CCCWFU. Study staff will work 
with the Wake Forest Health Sciences Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Cancer 
Informatics Group to identify potential CCCWFU patients from the electronic 
medical record  and/or cancer registry . Potentially eligible patients will be recruited 
through a dire ct in-clinic approach as well as mailed letters followed by a phone 
call by a study team member. The recruitment call will be followed by an email 
ENHANCING MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES WITH 
EMOTION REGULATION  (EMPOWER)  
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU 99516  
Page 6 of 43 
 outlining the details discussed during the phone call and instructions on next steps 
and a link to the screen ing questionnaire ( Recruitment Email Script ).  IRB-
approved s tudy flyers will be placed in the community at large, the Comprehensive 
Cancer Center at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and other strategic locations 
associated with Wake Forest Baptist Medic al Center . IRB-approved study flyers  
may also be disseminated through email blasts or posting s on websites of local 
cancer support agencies such as Cancer Services.  
 
Patients will then be screened for eligibility using an online screening questionnaire 
on Qualtrics.  Those that are ineligible will be displayed a message stating that 
he/she was ineligible. Patients who are eligible based will be navigated to the 
consent form and initial study questionnaire on Qualtrics, an online data collection 
tool that e nables researchers to create study -specific websites for capturing patient  
data securely online. The instrument library includes self -report batteries or profiles 
from Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
and the NIH Toolbox wh ich include many of the measures that will be used in the 
study.  At completion of the baseline questionnaire, all patients  will be given access 
to the PA intervention.  
The PA intervention is a 5 session online intervention that teaches 8 skills for 
incre asing the frequency of positive emotions: 1) noting daily positive events25-28 
2) capitalizing on or savoring positive events;29-30 3) gratitude;31-33 4) 
mindfulness;34-37 5) positive reappraisal;38-45 6) focusing on personal strengths;42-
43,49-52 7) setting and working toward attainable goals;53-54,55-58and 8) small acts of 
kindness.59-63 The skills are presented over the course of 5 weeks. A week will 
consist of 1 -2 days of didactic material and several days of brief, real -life skills 
practice an d reporting, with each day’s “home practice” taking approximately 20 -
30 minutes to complete. Patients  cannot skip ahead, but they can return to old 
lessons or exercises if they choose. Most exercises are done in a “diary” format in 
which patients ’ past res ponses are displayed next to their new ones, so that every 
time the patient  visits that exercise they see their growing list of past positive 
experiences. Patients will be permitted up to 8 weeks to complete this self -guided 
intervention to account for nor mal inte rruptions and unexpected delays in life . 
 
Acceptability Interview.  Research staff will conduct a 30 -minute audio -recorded, 
post-intervention phone interview with all patients  approximately one week after 
the intervention is complete to gather accep tability data .  The semi -structured 
interview includes questions where participants rank the skill sessions  in terms of 
favorite topics, the likelihood of referral to others (a friend or someone diagnosed 
with cancer) and the likelihood of practicing learn ed skills.  There is also a section 
with open -ended questions, including questions about participant experiences with 
use of the website  and home practice exercises  
Patient  Incentives. Each patient  will be paid $10 for each completed assessment 
for a maxim um of $30. Patients  will be paid in full upon completion of the study via 
virtual gift card.

Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU 99516  
Page 7 of 43 
 Fidelity Monitoring.  Whether patients  underst ood and remember the intervention 
content will be assessed via multiple -choice "quiz" questions within each lesson. If 
patients  are not able to answer a question, it will trigger a review of the relevant 
material ( patients  can also choose to review past material at any time). How 
frequently patients  visit the webs ite and how many times they complete the daily 
practice exercises for each skill  will also be recorded . This information can be used 
in "dose -response" analyses to determine whether greater exposure to the 
exercises leads to stronger intervention effects.  Patient  progress  will be monitored 
during the study and patients  who appear to be having trouble or are disengaging 
from the intervention  will be contacted . Our experience indicates that even very 
brief human contact can increase patients ' commitment to th e intervention. 
Patients  will receive an email or phone call from a study staff member if they fail to 
visit the website more than 3 days in a week. Patients  who cannot be reached or 
who do not resume visiting the website but also don't ask to leave the st udy will be 
re-contacted once per week for 3 weeks. After that they will be counted as non -
completers, though we will still try to contact them to obtain post -intervention 
measures. Patients  who do not reach the final lesson at the end of 8 weeks will 
also be considered non -completers and will be asked to take the post -intervention 
measures at that time.  
5.0 Study Outcome s and Study  Measures  
 
Patients will complete self -report questionnaires at baseline (pre -test), 
approximately 8 weeks after baseline (post -test), then at 12 weeks (follow -up) for 
a total of 3 assessments, each lasting approximately 25 -30 minutes. All 
measures will be completed from home via patients ’ personal computers. In 
addition to the measures listed below, key demographics will be assessed 
(race/ethnicity, education, household income, insurance status), cancer type, 
time since diagnosis, type of treatment, and time since treatment (See Appendix 
3 for a complete list of measures).  
 
5.1  Primary Outcomes  
 
The primary outcomes for this study are measures of feasibility – accrual, 
refusal, retention, adherence and acceptability.  
 
5.2 Secondary Outcomes  
 
5.2.1  Health -Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).  The PROMIS global health items 
will be used to assess overa ll HRQOL,68 and the PROMIS -2969-70 to assess 
domain -specific aspects of HRQOL. The PROMIS Global scale consists of 
10 items that assess general health, including overall physical and mental 
health. The PROMIS -29 consists of 29 items that assess physical 
functioning, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social 
ENHANCING MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES WITH

 functioning, pain interference, and pain intensity. These PROMIS measures 
will be supplemented with additional items from the PROMIS physical 
function short form71 and the PROMIS anger shor t form.72 The 4 PROMIS 
items for depression in this measure do not assess suicidality.  
 
5.2.2 Psychological well -being.  Psychological well -being will be assessed with 
NIH Toolbox short forms for positive affect, life satisfaction, and meaning 
and purpose.73 In addition, the NIH PROMIS General Self -Efficacy short 
form74 will be administered as it is a closely related construct to 
psychological well -being and positively associated with better patient -
reported outcomes.  
5.2.3 Health Behaviors.  Healthy behaviors often associated with enhanced 
coping and better adjustment will be assessed.75 Physical health behaviors 
will include: diet,76 exercise,77 alcohol consumption,76 and cigarette 
smoking.76 
6.0 Statistical Considerations  
Wake Forest School of Medicine will be the Coordinating Center for the study 
and will conduct all data analysis.  
 
6.1 Analysis of Primary Objective  
Accrual will be estimated as the number of patients  accrued divided by the number 
of months of accrual. A 95% confidence interval for the monthly accrual rate will 
be calculated based on the Poisson distribution. The refusal rate will be estimated 
as the number of patients who refuse to participate divided by the number eligible. 
Retention will be primarily defined as the proportion of patients  who provide 8 week 
and 12 week data. Patients  who discontinue the intervention (refuse phone calls) 
but complete the outcome assessments will be counted in the numerator for 
calculating retention. Retention estimates will be calculated overall and by site. 
Adherence to the intervention will be calculated as the number of intervention 
sessions completed, the frequency of completing exercises, and number of 
website visits. We will calculate and report the mean adherence across all 
individuals as well as the proportion of patients  who completed three or more 
sessions. Several measures will be used to quantify acceptability, including 
quantitative measures and interview. Means and the proportion responding 
affirmatively to the highest two responses for e ach question will be combined and 
exact 95% CIs will be calculated for these estimates. In addition, Dr. Salsman and 
Dr. Moskowitz will review open -ended (written) feedback and audio -recordings of 
phone interviews to identify meta -themes and determine satu ration of concepts.78

Page 9 of 43 
 6.2  Analysis of Secondary Objective  
 
Quantitative outcomes will be assessed by a covariance pattern model for 
repeated measures to examine change in PA and PROMIS scores over time.  
 
6.2 Power and Sample Size  
 
While this is a pilot study and we will not be testing the efficacy  of the intervention, 
we do want to be able to estimate feasibility, acceptability, and changes in PA and 
PROMIS scores with a fair degree of precision. With a total of 60 patients  we can 
estimate confidence intervals around means  to within ±0.25 SD, and proportions 
within ±12.7% , with 95% confidence. Assuming that 20% of the patients  may drop 
out, we could estimate confidence intervals for means within ±0.28 SD and 
proportions within ±14.1%  for measures evaluated at the end of the study. 
Furthermore, t he sample size of N=60 should permit us to achieve data saturation, 
or the point at which successive information serves only to replicate previous 
content themes and no new information is obtai ned.79 Past research reveals that 
saturation often occurs within the first 12 interviews.78  
 
6.3 Estimated Accrual Rate  
 
It is anticipated that 3.2 patients a month will be accrued to this trial, meeting the 
target of 60 in 19 months.  To date, we have recruited 18 patients  in 6 months at 
the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.  
 
6.4 Estimated Study Length  
 
Patients  will complete their participation in 12 weeks, for an estimated study length 
of 15 months.   
 
 
7.0 Data Management  
 
The web intervention is delivered via a customized website built on Moodle, a 
courseware platform that is used by schools and universities worldwide. Moodle 
allows delivery of text or video instruction as well as interactive activities such as 
journals and adaptive quizzes. Moodle is recognized as secure and well -tested 
software, and HIPAA -compliant . All communications with the website will use 
industry -standard TLS/SSL encryption. Another layer of security will be provided 
by avoiding a ny use of personally identifiable information, medical information, or 
other sensitive information in the context of the intervention. Patients ' Moodle 
accounts will not be linked to their real name or email address. The design of our 
intervention website has been refined through a number of iterations based on 
user testing and feedback from study patients  (e.g., simplifying the interface, 
ENHANCING MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES WITH 
EMOTION REGULATION  (EMPOWER)

 clearly labeling new material and exercises). We have also ensured that material 
is viewable on handheld, tablet, and l aptop devices.

8.0 Confidentiality and Privacy  
 
Confidentiality will be protected by collecting only information needed to assess study 
outcomes, minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that 
could directly identify subjects, and maintaining all study information in a secure 
manner. To help ensure subject privacy and confidentiality, only a unique study 
identifier will appear on the data collection form. Any collected patient identifying 
information corresponding to the unique study identifier will be maintained on a li nkage 
file, store separately from the data. The linkage file will be kept secure, with access 
limited to designated study personnel. Following data collection subject identifying 
information will be destroyed (state the anticipated time the data will be de stroyed, e.g. 
three years after closure of the study, and the method of destruction), consistent with 
data validation and study design, producing an anonymous analytical data set. Data 
access will be limited to study staff. Data and records will be kept lo cked and secured, 
with any computer data password protected. No reference to any individual patient  will 
appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise from the study.  
9.0 Data Safety and Monitoring  
 
The principal investigator will be res ponsible for the overall monitoring of the data and 
safety of study patients . The principal investigator will be assisted by other members of 
the study staff.  
 
The risks of this study are low; however staff will be trained to handle situations with 
sensiti vity and empathy.  The study coordinator will be trained to monitor for significant 
patient distress or depressive symptoms and  will be instructed on the appropriate 
courses of referral is a patient  is considered to be at risk for a safety concern.

 10.0 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or 
Deviations  
 
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or 
protocol changes will be promptly reported by the principal investigator or designated 
member of the researc h team to the IRB and sponsor or appropriate government 
agency if appropriate.

Planning for continued practice  
 
For this last section, I’d like to talk about continued practice of the skills we covered. A basic 
premise of these coping skills is that they only work if you continue  to practice them.  
Again these skills are like muscles, if you don’t exercise them, they aren’t likely to work 
very well. For these skills to be beneficial to you, you need to make them habits.  
 
 
 
 
  It sounds like you plan to continue (XX skill from abov e participant is going to practice most 
frequently) but are less likely to continue (XX skill from above participant is going to 
practice less).  First let’s talk about the one that you plan to continue.  What about it is 
appealing to you?  How do you plan  to fit it into your day and make it a habit?   
 
 
 
 
How about your least favorite skill?  Can you tell me what about that one makes you less likely 
to try and incorporate it into your life?  
 
 
  
  
 
One of the interesting things about any new skill is that aft er a while you might get bored with it 
or it may stop having the same impact that it had initially.  If (skill participant rates as 
most likely to continue) starts getting old for you, you should go back to the skills and 
choose another one and increase yo ur practice of that one.  Let’s talk about (XX skill that 
participant rated the second most likely to practice) and ways you might be able to 
incorporate that into your daily life.   
 
 
*********************************************************************** ****  
Questions about website usage:  
 
Can you talk about your experience using the intervention website?  
Probe: What features did you like?  
      What could have been clearer?  
 
 
What did you think of the at home practice exercises?  
 
 
If the participant did not progress through all the lessons

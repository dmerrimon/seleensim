4  Cohort Creation We will create two separate, analysis-ready datasets to carry out the analyses for Aims 1.1 and 1.2.  1. Aim 1 Cohort Creation 1.1. Please identify all Veterans who have a positive laboratory test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between January 19, 2020 to present-day using the official VA definition in the COVID-19 domain (see Appendix A). The date of the positive test will be denoted as the index date. 1.2. Restrict the cohort to Veterans without a hospitalization in the 7 days prior to the index date to narrow the cohort to Veterans who were tested in the outpatient setting. 1.3. Restrict the cohort to Veterans who had ≥1 inpatient or any outpatient encounter in each of the two, six-month periods during the 365 days prior to the index date.  1.4. Restrict the cohort to Veterans without data inconsistencies (test patients, not Veterans, multiple death dates in data, or not alive on index date).  1.5. Restrict the cohort to Veterans with a diagnosis of hypertension at any point prior to their index date (see Appendix B for definition of hypertension). 1.6. Restrict the cohort to Veterans who have an outpatient pharmacy fill in 90 days prior to the index date for any antihypertensive medication (see Appendix E). 1.7. Cohort creation specific for Aim 1.1  1.7.1. Follow steps 1.1 through 1.6 above. 1.7.2. Restrict the analysis to Veterans who do not have a history of diabetes, stroke, chronic kidney disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or coronary heart disease (see Appendix B for definitions of these conditions). 1.7.3. Categorize Veterans according to current antihypertensive medication use as in steps 1.7.3.1 and 1.7.3.2 below. The groups should be mutually exclusive. 1.7.3.1. Identify and categorize Veterans who have a pharmacy fill for an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; see Appendix E) within the 90 days prior to the index date. These Veterans will be categorized as Veterans with current use of “ACEI/ARB-based regimens”. Veterans included in this group may have fills for non-ACEI/ARB medications but must also have a fill for an ACEI or an ARB. For each Veteran, please create variables to indicate the use of these non-ACEI/ARB medication classes in the dataset. 
5  1.7.3.2. Identify Veterans who have a pharmacy fill an antihypertensive medication class other than an ACEI or an ARB AND do not have a fill for an ACEI or an ARB (see Appendix E) within the 90 days prior to the index date. These Veterans will be categorized as Veterans with current use of “non-ACEI/ARB-based regimens”. Veterans included in this group may have fills for multiple non-ACEI/ARB medications. For each Veteran’s regimen, please create variables to indicate the use of all medication classes in the dataset. 1.7.4. Please provide a flow chart with the number of Veterans retained and excluded during steps 1.1 through 1.7.3.2. See Figure 1. 1.8. Cohort creation specific for Aim 1.2  1.8.1. Follow steps 1.1 through 1.6 above. 1.8.2. Exclude Veterans who do not have a pharmacy fill for an ACEI or ARB within the 90 days prior to the index date (see Appendix E). 1.8.3. Exclude Veterans who have a pharmacy fill for both an ACEI and an ARB within the 90 days prior to the index date. 1.8.4. Identify and categorize Veterans who have a pharmacy fill for ACEI within the 90 days prior to the index date. These Veterans will be categorized as “ACEI users”. Veterans included in this group may have fills for non-ACEI medications (other than ACEIs) but must also have a fill for an ACEI. For each Veteran, please create variables to indicate the use of these non-ACEI medication classes in the dataset. 1.8.5. Identify and categorize Veterans who have a pharmacy fill for an ARB within the 90 days prior to the index date. These Veterans will be categorized as “ARB users”. Veterans included in this group may have fills for non-ARB medications (other than ARBs) but must also have a fill for an ARB. For each Veteran, please create variables to indicate the use of these non-ARB medication classes in the dataset. 1.8.6. Please provide a flow chart with the number of Veterans retained and excluded during steps 1.1 through 1.6, then 1.8.1 through 1.8.5. See Figure 3. 
6  Data Management  1. The data management will be conducted using VINCI. Consistency will be followed for the name and levels for variables created for Veterans in each data set. The steps below describe the data management for Veterans who are included in the aim 1.1 cohort (ACEI/ARB-based regimens vs. non-ACEI/ARB-based regimen) and the aim 1.2 cohort (ACEI users vs. ARB users). Baseline covariates will be created as listed in Appendix B. Please produce separate analyses ready datasets for aims 1.1 and 1.2. 2. Please report the percent missingness of each variable in each cohort, separately. 3. For each cohort, create a single variable indicating to which medication exposure group the Veteran has been assigned. a. Aim 1.1: “ACEI/ARB-based regimen cohort” and “non-ACEI/ARB-based regimen cohort” b. Aim 1.2: “ACEI user cohort” and “ARB user cohort”. 4. For each Veteran, identify the occurrence of the primary and secondary outcomes. 5. For each observation, identify the time to occurrence or censoring of the primary and secondary outcomes in days, separately. 6. For secondary analyses within each cohort (see statistical analysis section): a. The main exposure will be re-defined using alternative exposure definitions, and patients will be re-categorized according to these new definitions (see Appendix C). The primary analysis will be repeated.  b. A variable identifying the occurrence of negative control outcomes will be created. c. A variable identifying the time to occurrence or censoring of negative control outcomes in days will be created. 
7  Statistical analysis Aim 1.1 1. Calculate baseline patient characteristics (Appendix B) for users of ACEI/ARB-based regimens and non-ACEI/ARB-based regimens, separately. Populate Table 1, left panel (“before weighting”).  2. Generate propensity scores (PS) for being a user of an ACEI/ARB-based regimen vs. a non-ACEI/ARB-based regimen using generalized boosted regression models as a function of all baseline covariates.1,2 The algorithm should minimize standardized mean differences in covariates between exposure groups in the PS-weighted population.3  Generate Supplemental Figure S1, which shows the distribution of PSs among Veterans who are hospitalized for COVID-19 between the ACEI/ARB-based regimen vs. non-ACEI/ARB-based regimen cohorts. 3. Use the final PS generated in step 2 to calculate each study-eligible Veteran’s matching weight.  4. Verify covariate balance in the matching weighted population using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric4,5 and calculate absolute standardized mean differences. Populate Table 1, right panel (“after weighting”). Generate Supplemental Figure S2. 5. Primary analysis: Apply matching-weighted Cox regression with Poissonization6 to estimate the causal marginal hazard ratio comparing the primary outcome (time to all-cause hospitalization or all-cause mortality) and secondary outcomes as appropriate between medication exposure groups (ACEI/ARB-based regimens vs. non-ACEI/ARB-based regimens). Populate Table 2 and generate Figure 2. 6. Perform bootstrap resampling7 to generate 95% confidence intervals using 2-sided alpha = 0.025 for the primary outcome and 2-sided alpha = 0.05 for the secondary outcomes.  7. Secondary analyses: a. Re-run steps 5 and 6 as follows and populate Supplemental Table S1:  i. Unadjusted (i.e., “Crude” analysis, Cox regression with no covariate adjustment)  ii. Multivariable-adjusted (Cox regression with Poissonization with adjustment for all covariates included in the estimation of the PS),  iii. PS adjusted (Cox regression with Poissonization with PS used as a covariate in the model, adjusted for deciles of the PS),  iv. PS stratification (Cox regression with Poissonization within strata of deciles of the PS to estimate stratum-specific estimates of treatment 
8  effect. Produce and report a pooled estimate [not stratum-specific] across stratum to estimate an overall treatment effect via the method of Imbens8).  v. PS matching (Cox regression with Poissonization within a 1:1 PS matched (greedy algorithm, nearest neighbor matching with a caliper size equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the PS without replacement).  vi. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) (Weighted Cox regression with Poissonization using stabilized, traditional IPTW with truncation at 99th percentile). vii. Subgroup analyses. The PS and matching weights will need to be reproduced within each subgroup for each subgroup analysis. Populate Supplemental Table S2 with results of all subgroup analyses. 1. Stratify the population by the total number of antihypertensive medications in the regimen (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ≥4). Repeat primary analysis within these strata (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). 2. Create subgroups of the population by age (<40, 40 to <50, 50 to <60, 60 to <70 and ≥70 years), sex (male and female), race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian), and body mass index (<18.5 kg/m2, 18.5-<25 kg/m2 , 25-<30 kg/m2 , and ≥30 kg/m2). Repeat primary analysis within each subgroup (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). 3. Stratify the population by tertiles of Modified Therapeutic Intensity Score of the medication defining the main exposure. Repeat the primary analysis within each tertile (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). viii. Sensitivity analysis varying the exposure definition. The PS and matching weights will need to be reproduced within each group under each alternative definition. Populate Supplemental Table S3 with results. 1. Re-define the primary exposure according to the alterative definitions listed in Appendix C. The alternative definition will only apply to the primary exposure of interest. For example, if a patient is taking an ACEI and a calcium channel blocker, the definition will only be applied to the ACEI. For the non-ACEI/ARB-based 
9  regimen group, the alternative definition must hold true for at least one of the medications in the regimen.  2. Re-categorize Veterans into exposure groups based on each definition. 3. Recalculate primary and secondary outcomes under each alternative exposure definition (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). 8. Secondary analyses: a. Repeat the primary analysis (i.e., Step 5 only) for all negative control outcomes, separately. See Appendix D for definitions of negative control outcomes. Populate Supplemental Table S4. b. Perform methods described by Vanderweele9 to describe the value of the joint minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder must have with the treatment and outcome to fully explain away the observed treatment-outcome association and generate Supplemental Figure S3. c. Perform negative control calibration on the estimates generated in the primary analysis to adjust for residual bias using the control outcome calibration approach by Tchetgen Tchetgen.10  Aim 1.2 1. Calculate baseline patient characteristics (Appendix B) for ACEI users and ARB users, separately. Populate Table 3, left panel (“before weighting”).  2.

Use the final PS generated in step 2 to calculate each study-eligible Veteran’s matching weight.  4. Verify covariate balance in the matching weighted population using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric4,5 and calculate absolute standardized mean differences. Populate Table 3, right panel (“after weighting”). Generate Supplemental Figure S5. 5. Primary analysis: Apply matching-weighted Cox regression with Poissonization6 to estimate the causal marginal hazard ratio comparing the primary outcome (time to all-
10  cause hospitalization or all-cause mortality) and secondary outcomes as appropriate between medication exposure groups (ACEI users vs. ARB users). Populate Table 4 and generate Figure 4. 6. Perform bootstrap resampling7 to generate 95% confidence intervals using 2-sided alpha = 0.025 for the primary outcome and 2-sided alpha = 0.05 for the secondary outcomes.  7. Secondary analyses: a. Re-run steps 5 and 6 as follows and populate Supplemental Table S5:  i. Unadjusted (i.e., “Crude” analysis, Poisson regression with no covariate adjustment)  ii.

Stratify the population by the total number of antihypertensive medications in the regimen (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ≥4). Repeat primary analysis within these strata (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). 2. Create subgroups of the population by age (<40, 40 to <50, 50 to <60, 60 to <70 and ≥70 years), sex (male and female), race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian), and body mass index (<18.5 kg/m2, 18.5-<25 kg/m2 , 25-
11  <30 kg/m2 , and ≥30 kg/m2). Repeat primary analysis within each subgroup (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). 3.

Create subgroups of the population by age (<40, 40 to <50, 50 to <60, 60 to <70 and ≥70 years), sex (male and female), race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian), and body mass index (<18.5 kg/m2, 18.5-<25 kg/m2 , 25-<30 kg/m2 , and ≥30 kg/m2). Repeat primary analysis within each subgroup (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). 3. Stratify the population by tertiles of Modified Therapeutic Intensity Score of the medication defining the main exposure. Repeat the primary analysis within each tertile (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). viii. Sensitivity analysis varying the exposure definition. The PS and matching weights will need to be reproduced within each group under each alternative definition. Populate Supplemental Table S11 with results. 1. Re-define the primary exposure according to the alterative definitions listed in Appendix H. The alternative definition will only apply to the primary exposure of interest. For example, if a patient 
19  is taking an ACEI and a calcium channel blocker, the definition will only be applied to the ACEI. For the non-ACEI/ARB-based regimen group, the alternative definition must hold true for at least one of the medications in the regimen.  2. Re-categorize Veterans into exposure groups based on each definition. 3. Recalculate primary and secondary outcomes under each alternative exposure definition (i.e., Steps 5 and 6 above only). 8. Secondary analyses: a. Repeat the primary analysis for all negative control outcomes, separately. See Appendix I for definitions of negative control outcomes. Populate Supplemental Table S12. b. Perform methods described by Vanderweele9 to describe the value of the joint minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder must have with the treatment and outcome to fully explain away the observed treatment-outcome association and generate Supplemental Figure S9. c. Perform negative control calibration on the estimates generated in the primary analysis to adjust for residual bias using the control outcome calibration approach by Tchetgen Tchetgen.10 d. Leave-out-an-essential-ingredient negative control sensitivity analysis:  i. This analysis will require one additional step.  ii. First, generate a PS for being in the COVID-19 cohort vs. non-COVID-19 cohort.  iii. Perform PS matching to match each COVID-19 veteran with a non-COVID-19 Veteran using a 1:1 PS matching (greedy algorithm, nearest neighbor matching with a caliper size equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the PS without replacement).  iv. Next, repeat steps 2-6 above to estimate the association of the main medication exposure with the study outcomes. Repeat the primary analysis in this matching weighted cohort. Populate Supplemental Table S13.  
20  Aim 2.2 1. Calculate baseline patient characteristics (Appendix B) for ACEI users and ARB users, separately. Populate Table 7, left panel (“before weighting”).  2. Generate PS for being a user of an ACEI vs. an ARB using generalized boosted regression models as a function of baseline covariates.1,2 The algorithm should minimize standardized mean differences in covariates between exposure groups in the PS-weighted population.3 Generate Supplemental Figure S10, which shows the distribution of PSs among outpatient Veterans who are hospitalized for COVID-19 between the ACEI users vs. ARB users. 3. Use the final PS generated in step 2 to calculate each study-eligible Veteran’s matching weight.  4. Verify covariate Verify covariate balance in the matching weighted population using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric4,5 and calculate absolute standardized mean differences. Populate Table 7, right panel (“after weighting”). Generate Supplemental Figure S11. 5. Primary analysis: Apply matching-weighted Cox regression with Poissonization6 to estimate the causal marginal hazard ratio comparing the primary outcome (time to all-cause mortality) and secondary outcomes as appropriate between medication exposure groups (ACEI users vs. ARB users). Populate Table 8 and generate Figure 8. 6. Perform bootstrap resampling7 to generate 95% confidence intervals using 2-sided alpha = 0.05 for the primary and secondary outcomes.  7. Secondary analyses: a. Re-run steps 5 and 6 as follows and populate Supplemental Table S14:  i. Unadjusted (i.e., “Crude” analysis, Cox regression with Poissonization6 with no covariate adjustment)  ii. Multivariable-adjusted (Cox regression with Poissonization6 with adjustment for all covariates included in the estimation of the PS),  iii. Propensity-score adjusted (Cox regression with Poissonization6 with PS used as a covariate in the model, adjusted for deciles of the PS),  iv. PS stratification (Cox regression with Poissonization6 within strata of PS to estimate stratum-specific estimates of treatment effect. Produce and report a pooled estimate [not stratum-specific] across stratum to estimate an overall treatment effect via the method of Imbens8).  v. PS matching (Cox regression with Poissonization6 within a 1:1 PS matched (greedy algorithm, nearest neighbor matching with a caliper size 
21  equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the PS without replacement).  vi. IPTW (Weighted Cox regression with Poissonization6 using stabilized, traditional IPTW with truncation at 99th percentile) vii. Subgroup analyses. The PS and matching weights will need to be reproduced within each subgroup for each subgroup analysis. Populate Supplemental Table S15 with results of all subgroup analyses. 1.

95  Appendix A: Variables used to define study population (Aim 1). Variable Definition Index date Date of the positive SARS-CoV-2 test. SARS-CoV-2 positive test Veterans with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test between January 19, 2020, to present-day will be identified using the VA’s official SARS-CoV-2 phenotype definition, which incorporates testing external to the VA. Patients identified as “VA confirmed” and “VA probable” will be categorized as SARS-CoV-2 positive.  SARS-CoV-2 positive outpatients Veterans with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test will be identified as above. Then, to capture outpatients who have been tested, patients will be excluded if they have been hospitalized within the 7 days before the date of the positive test.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 Background and Rational  
 
Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal anomaly recognized at birth, with an 
incidence of about 1 in 1000 births in the United States [ 1]. DS is caused by the presence of all 
or part of an extr a copy of chromosome 21, which can lead to deficits in assimilation and 
adaptation along with cognitive impairment [ 2].  
 Both AD and DS have significant overlaps in clinical phenotype and neuropathology. Virtually all individuals with DS are likely to develop clinical and ne uropathological brain changes 
resembling Alzheimer’s dementia by the ages of 35 -40 years, which include deposits of 
extracellular amyloid -beta oligomers (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) [ 3, 4].  
In addition, both DS and AD are associated with a similar hierarchy and distribution of amyloid plaques, microglial activation, astrogliosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic loss [ 5-
12]. Conversely, DS can be distinguished from AD based on the age of dementia onset, the 
higher degree of amyloid plaque burden and hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles, and the relatively decreased amount of neuronal  loss. Cognitive impairment in DS has further been 
attributed to a combination of increased GABAergic neurotransmission and disrupted axonal function [ 5, 13] .  DS is associated with degeneration of cholinergic neurons, and cholinesterases, 
namely donepezil and rivastigmine, have b een studied in DS and found to be well -tolerated with 
a minimal, yet generally positive treatment effect in exploratory investigations [ 2, 14- 17]. 
However, there are no current FDA -approved t reatments for cognitive impairment associated 
with DS.  
 The AD brain is characterized by a severely impaired insulin -signaling pathway, including 
deficits of insulin, insulin -like growth factor insulin receptors, and central resistance to insulin 
action [ 18]. As a result of impaired insulin s ignaling, glucose uptake and utilization may be 
dramatically decreased in both patients with DS and AD.  Flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans of patients with AD show very little uptake and utilization of glucose within posterior temporo -
parietal structures and similar processes involving posterior cingulate glucose utilization has been demonstrated in DS [10].   
 Originally thought to exist solely in the periphery, insulin has since been determined to be instrumental in the overall health and function of the CNS [ 19].  Central insulin and IRs have 
been established as differing from that of the systemically occurring counterparts that specifically regulate the utilization of glucose.  Although central insulin does induce glucose uptake in the brain, it also functions i n the modulation of various neurotransmitters and receptors 
involved in executive function and long -term potentiation of memories [ 20, 21] .  For example, 
systems with impaired insulin signaling pathways have demonstrated inhibition of acetylcholine biosynthesis and subsequently have incurred debilitating effects on neuronal plasticity [ 22, 23] .  
Thus, c ognitive function and memory falter as a result of decreased insulin- controlled regulation 
of, among others, acetylcholine, norepinephrine and activated NMDA receptors [ 23-25].  
8 
25 August 2014  Confidential  Consistent with evidence of insulin functioning as a neuromodulator in the facilitation memory is 
the high- density of IRs in the hippocampus and cerebr al cortex, which are regions of the brain 
integral to the formation, retention and recall of information [ 19, 26] .  Treatment of animal 
models with intracerebral ventricular insulin has benefited the model with improved memory in passive -avoidance tasks [ 27].  Further, intranasal insulin has been shown to reduce memory loss 
in aging diabetic animals. [ 28] In ad dition, intranasal insulin also ameliorates experimental 
diabetic neuropathy and prolongs lifespan when compared to systemic insulin treatment. [29].  Finally, intranasal insulin has been reported to ameliorate tau hyperphosphorylation in a rat 
model of type 2 diabetes [30].   
 Pre-clinical work has shown that insulin regulates the pathological hallmark proteins associated 
with both AD and DS, including NFTs and amyloid plaques (AP) [ 31-33].  Increasing central 
insulin concentration may decrease NFT formation through inhibition of tau phosphorylation by maintaining the phosphorylation equilibrium between kinase and phosphatase activity [ 34]. 
Insulin reduces amyloid plaque burden through the stimulation of insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) [ 35]. Finally, insulin receptor signaling  increases synaptic density, which may counteract 
the characteristic loss of synapses occurring in AD and DS [ 36].  The numerous 
neuropathological similarities that exist in AD and DS characterize the insulin signaling pathway as a promising treatment approach in DS.  
 As a large, charged molecule, insulin does not readily cross the blood- brain barrier (BBB), and 
hence, intranasal (IN) delivery of offers a non -invasive route directly to the brain, while 
minimizing systemic exposure.  Peptides, proteins, vaccines, drug treatments and charged molecules of various sizes are able to pass along the olfactory and trigeminal nerves and are deposited directly into the CNS without having to pass through the BBB that may degrade or 
limit the amount arriving at the target [ 37-44].  Intranasally -delivered insulin in healthy adults 
has been detected in the CSF as early as 10 minutes after IN administration without a significant 
decrease in systemic blood glucose or alteration in  systemic blood insulin levels  [32, 39, 45, 46] . 
or peripheral insulin levels  
 The majority of the work demonstrating the efficacy of insulin in the AD population has been performed by Dr. Suzanne Craft at the University of Washington, often in colla boration with Dr. 
William H. Frey II. A clinical trial consisting of 26 memory impaired subjects (13 with AD and 
13 with mild cognitive impairment) and 35 normal controls showed that IN insulin 20 IU or 40 IU improved two declarative memory tasks compared t o placebo within 15 minutes of drug 
administration [32].  IN insulin administered at 20 IU resulted in greater story recall whereas 
doses at 40 IU more favorably improved word list recall. Another study of 24 early AD/mild cognitive impairment subjects showed that 20 IU BID of intranasal insulin resulted in sustained benefit in over a 21 day period [ 46].  Furthermore, IN insulin resulted in favorable changes in the 
serum amyloid -beta 40/42 ratio while having no impact on systemic glucose or insulin levels. 
Most recently, Craft  and colleagues have shown improved memory in AD patients following IN 
insulin treatment in a four month clinical trial [ 47].   
 
Intranasal insulin’s cognitive benefits extend beyond the MCI/AD population, having been 
demonstrated in healthy control subjects.  A randomized double blind study of 38 normal 
controls treated with 40 IU IN insulin, 4 times/day over 8 weeks demonstrated benefits in 
9 
25 August 2014  Confidential  attention, immediate and delayed recall, and mood in the treatment group [ 48]. This same 
research center later performed a study in 38 normal subjects showing that rapid- acting  insulin 
aspart resulted in greater declarative memory improvements than IN regular insulin over 8 
weeks’ time [ 49].   
 
To test the hypothesis regarding the acute safety and efficacy of rapid acting (RA) insulin 
glulisine in AD, our group performed a double blinded, randomized, placebo- controlled, cross -
over study in 9 mild- moderate ApoE4+ AD subjects.  Glulisine is a rapidly absorbed insulin 
analogue lacking the zinc ingredient commonly found in insulin formulations, and may hypothet ically be a safer, better tolerated insulin considering findings that zinc -containing 
compounds may be toxic to olfactory neurons [ 50, 51].  The study drug was administered 
intranasally using the LMA Mucosal Atomization Device (MAD). Treated subjects made fewer Trails B errors relative to controls.   Otherwise, there were no significant difference between intranasal glulisine and placebo for cognitive tests of learning/memory, attention/executive function, language, or visuospatial function. Fingerstick glucose was not impacted by IN glulisine, but t he drug resulted in a 19% decrease in insulin levels compared to baseline.  The 
findings indicated that mild -moderate ApoE4+ AD patients were unresponsive to acute IN 
glulisine, but that the drug was safe and well -tolerated.  
 
In the current study, we aim to demonstrate the safety of IN RA insulin glulisine in the DS population with a double blinded, randomized, placebo- controlled, cross -over study design. This 
investigation will enroll DS subjects with a high probability of ele vated plaque burden, aged 
≥35, who may or may not be suffering from dementia.  Recognizing the logistical limitations of 
positioning and administering study drug with the LMA MAD device, we will be using the Impel intranasal device (see description below), which would be expected to more efficiently deliver study drug to the target region.  
 
 
2. SUMMARY OF DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
2.1. Intranasal Pressurized Olfactory Delivery (POD) Device  
The Pressurized Olfactory Delivery (POD) device is intended to be used with a variety of known and ye t-to-be-known drugs. The POD device is designed specifically to deliver centrally acting 
drugs via the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathways in the roof of the nasal cavity and 
olfactory nasal epithelium.   
Commercially available aerosol nasal devices s uch as the LMA MAD device are not specifically 
engineered to facilitate nose- brain delivery, and consequently deposit most of the drug within the 
lower nasal cavity, resulting in suboptimal CNS penetration.  Other problems associated with 
traditional nasal sprays include variable aerosolized product, dependence on user position, and 
high frequency of device non- compliance/misuse.  The POD  device has specifically been 
developed to effectively and consistently deliver CNS therapeutics to the brain via the nasal/olfactory pathways.  The device is not currently FDA approved, but numerous studies 
support its role in intranasal brain delivery of radiolabeled and therapeutic compounds.

6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
6.1. Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
12 
25 August 2014  Confidential   
The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was developed by Cummings et al. (1994) to specifically 
measure neuropsychatric symptoms associated with both AD and non- AD dementias and has 
been shown to be reliable as well as valid [ 58].  The NPI examines 12 sub- domains of behavioral 
functioning: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritabili ty/lability, aberrant motor activity, night -time behavioral distur bances and 
eating abnormalities.  
 
6.1.1. Fuld Object -Memory Evaluation (FOME)  
 
The FOME is a validated measurement of memory and learning in older adults. This test allows 
the examiner to ev aluate memory and learning and eliminates disadvantages in relation to the 
effects of poor vision, hearing, language handicaps, cultural differences or inattention.   
6.1.2. CAMDEX -DS: Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of Older People with              
                                 Down syndrome and Others with Intellectual Disabilities  
 
The CAMDEX- DS is a comprehensive assessment tool used for screening for cognitive 
impairment and diagnosing dementia in people with DS. This test is a modified version of the 
CAMCOG and the CAMDEX- R and was created specifically for the DS population. The 
measure includes questions assessing various domains of cognitive functioning including orientation, comprehension, expressive language, memory, attention/concentration, visuospatial skills, and executive functions.    
6.1.3. Story Recall subtest of the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test for Children     
          (RBMT -C) 
 
The RBMT -C provides an objective measure of everyday memory problems reported and 
observed in subjects with memory difficulties. The story recall subtest involves immediate free 
recall, cued recall, and delayed recall of short story material which is presented orally to subjects by the examiner.  The RBMT -C is appealing for use in this population because the task is 
engaging, simple, and has been shown in other studies to be an effective measure of memory functions.      
6.1.4. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale -II 
 
This validated tool is utilized to measure and track adaptive behaviors (level of everyday 
functioning) in persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities and other disorders, such 
as autism, Asperger Syndrome, and developmental delays.

consistency, brachial artery pressure will be obtained in the routine fashion, the same arm will be 
used for all study measurements.  
Blood pressure and heart rate to be measured after subject has been sitting quietly for a minimum 
of 5 minutes.  Diastolic blood pressure will be measured at the disappearance of Korotkoff sounds. Vitals sign and O2 saturation will be monitored by clinical staff during each visit of the 
study.  
In addition, vital signs and O2 saturation will be measured pre and post study dose on Visits 2 
and 3. The investigator will be notified for any baseline changes in blood pressure >20 mmHg 
systolic and >10mmHg diastolic or O2 saturation < 90%.  
A baseline pre- dose fingerstick blood glucose will be measured followed by measurements post - 
study drug at 30 minutes. The investigator will be notified for any baseline changes. Percentage 
change from baseline glucose will be calculated as follows: [(pre- insulin serum glucose – post -
insulin serum glucose) / (pre -insulin serum glucose)] x  100%.  Any change >10% will be 
considered clinically significant.  
15 
25 August 2014  Confidential  Vital signs will be taken prior to ECG and blood draw.  
6.8. Weight  
 
Body weight will be measured at all visits, without heavy outer clothing or footwear.  
6.9. ECG  
 
A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed on all subjects at baseline and visit 4.  
6.10. Laboratory Samples  
 
All subjects will be required to fast for a minimum of 12 hours prior to collection of each blood sampling.  Any subject diagnosed with DS and lacki ng a karyotype -proven diagnosis will 
undergo blood draws for this test on visit 1.  
During Visit 2 & 3 blood samples will be collected after study dose administration and prior to 
memory and cognitive testing.  
 
7.  INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS  
 
7.1. Description of Investigational Products  
 
The Research Center will utilize the following investigation products: 
• Insulin glulisine  
• Placebo saline  
• POD Device  
• Syringe  
 
7.2. Handling and Storage  
 
The study drug must be handled and/or administered only by an authorized i nvestigative staff 
member.  
The study drug will be kept per label recommendations and institutional Standard Operational 
Policy, specifically, but not limited to temperature controlled secure area.  
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
 
Randomization will be stratified by gender a priori  by the permuted block method.  Sequences 
will be assigned for each gender by random selection of one of the twenty permutations of block 
of size 6 such that 3 of each gender are allocated to group 1, and 3 of each gender are allocated to group 2.  The trial is a double blinded study so that neither the subject, the investigator, nor the 
trial coordinator will know to which  sequence the subject has been randomized . To facilitate 
subject blinding, all subjec ts will undergo the same follow -up procedures. One clinician at the 
site will be unblinded to randomization and prepare the study dose for each subject. This person 
will not have responsibility for obtaining any study data.   The investigators will be provided 
16 
25 August 2014  Confidential  with a sealed envelope containing the true sequence of glulisine and saline for each group if the 
blind needs to be broken due to unforeseen circumstances.   
 
7.4. Packaging and Labeling 
 
All study drug and placebo will be labeled according to the following specifications: 
 
• IRB number  
• Quantity statement  
• Directions – To be administered only by investigative study staff  
• Storage conditions per label  
• “For Clinical Trial Use Only”  
 
7.5. Occupational Safety 
 
No known significant safety risks exist to site  personnel in direct or indirect contact with the 
study drug. 
 
 
8.  SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL  
8.1. Subject Completion  
 
Subjects completing all 4 study visits will be considered to have completed study.  
8.2. Subject Withdrawal  
 
Subject may withdraw from study at any time for any reason without penalty or be terminated 
from the study by the clinical investigator (see provisions for termination by study team.) Investigational team will document the reason(s) for withdrawal.  In the event a subject chooses to withdraw from study before Visit 4 the safety procedures described in Section 6.2.4. and will be performed ideally within 14 days following subject’s decision to withdraw.  For all subjects who withdraw, all final safety assessments will be collecte d regardless of time elapsed since 
previous visit.  In addition to final visit, subjects who withdraw early will be contacted within 7 days by study staff via telephone to assess development of new and/or ongoing AEs and concomitant medications.  Efforts w ill be made to recruit subjects to replace any withdrawals so 
as to maintain an n=12.  Subject’s participation may be terminated at the discretion of the investigator.  Individuals may be withdrawn for the following reasons:  
• Clinically significant adverse events  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Protocol violations  
• Inability to tolerate study medication  
• Other

25 August 2014  Confidential  9.   ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
9.1. Definition of AE  
 
An adverse event is any symptom, sign, illness or experience which develops or worse ns in 
severity during the course of the study. Inter val development of  illnesses or injuries will be 
regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be 
adverse events if the abnormality:  
• Results in study withdrawal  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Leads to treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• Is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
9.2. Definition of SAE  
 
Adverse events are classified as either serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event is any 
event that results in: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Disability or incapacitation  
• Other events determined by investigator to be medically significant in which subject’s w ell-
being is jeopardized (e.g. events that have high likelihood of escalating to the point of 
meeting criteria outlined above)  
9.2.1. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as AEs and                    SAEs  
Any new abnormal, vit al, examination, or laboratory finding judged clinically significant by the 
investigator will be documented as an AE or SAE, if meeting the definitions for such.  Abnormal 
lab findings or other abnormal assessments associated with the disease under study w ill not be 
considered AEs or SAEs unless more severe than expected, as judged by the investigator.  
9.2.2. Time Period and Frequency of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Upon consenting, a subject is considered to be a participant in the study, and until that person 
either withdraws or completes study, AEs and SAEs will be recorded.  The investigational team 
will promptly report any AE/SAE as required per federal guidelines.  
 
10. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. Statistical Analysis  
18 
25 August 2014  Confidential  All primary and se condary endpoints will be summarized within strata defined by treatment and 
study period.  
Treatment effects on both primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed using common 
statistical methodology for crossover trials. Continuous outcomes, such as the FOME and the RBMT -C, and count outcomes, such as adverse event incidence, will be analyze d using a mixed-
effects linear model to account for period effects and patient characteristics such as age and sex. Plots of the observed effects will be constructed to aid with interpretation.  
All statistical analyses will be completed using SAS® software . Visual representations of the 
data will be constructed using the package ‘ggplot2’ in R [ 63, 64 ]. 
10.2. Safety Outcomes  
The primary endpoint is defined as the ‘incidence of any or related adverse and/or serious events of intranasal glulisine  versus placebo.’ The difference in incidence of adverse events between 
subjects receiving glulisine and those receiving saline will be modeled in terms of rates using a mixed -effects Poisson regression model accounting for period and the treatment -period 
interaction as well as subject age and sex.  
10.3. Cognitive Outcomes  
The secondary endpoints consist of performance differences in the FOME and the RBMT -C 
between subjects  receiving glulisine and those receiving saline . These differences will be 
assessed u sing normal mixed -effects regression accounting for period and the treatment -period 
interaction as well as subject age and sex.  
10.4. Study Power  
   
Power analysis for the primary endpoint (incidence of adverse events) is simplified to a comparison of paired means. The following table presents power estimates for a variety of assumptions. Assumptions common to all scenarios are a sample size of 12 and an alpha of 0.05. The difference column corresponds to the difference in number of adverse events between the treatment and the placebo.  Although only half of these probable scenarios are adequately 
powered, such a result is acceptable for a pilot study su ch as this.                                       
Difference  St. Dev.  Power  
1.5 1.0 0.997  
1.5 1.5 0.883  
1.5 2.0 0.658  
2.0 1.0 1.000

11.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with GCP guidelines. Subject privacy requirements 
will be observed as well as the fundamental concepts of the Declaration of Helsinki (E.G. IRB approval of the study, obtaining informed consent from all subjects and meeting all reporting requirements).  
11.2. Quality Assurance  
 
In the event of a regulatory agency audit or inspection, site will allow the auditor/inspector access to all records documented and facilities utilized in conducting the study.  Site will also make accommodations (e.g. time, schedule) to discuss findings, concerns, and questions with 
auditor/inspector.   
11.3. Study Closure  
 
Upon completion of all subject visits, data entry and analysis, investigator will inform local IRB 
of study closure.  
11.4. Records Retention  
 
All site records will be maintained and stored in a safe and secure location for a minimum of 15 
years post study completion.  
11.5. Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators  
 
Study results will be made available by the study statistician  once analysis (Interim Analysis) is 
complete. Study Staff will not be unblinded in regards to individual subjects randomization 
status until after the database is lock ed. 
11.6. Data Management  
 
Data collection/reporting tools will be developed internally (i.e. CRFs and source documents). 
Data collected and stored electronically will remain confidential and secure (e.g. secured server, encrypted data, and password protected file).

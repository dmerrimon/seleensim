Low grade and/or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
1.1 Background and Overview
Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of 
lymphoproliferative malignancies with variable patterns of behavior and responses to treatment [1]. Like Hodgkin's disease, NHL usually originates in lymphoid tissues and can spread to other organs. However, NHL is much less predictable than Hodgkin's disease and has a far greater predilection to disseminate to extranodal sites. The prognosis depends on the histologic type, stage, and treatment. The working formulation divides NHL into three prognostic groups: low-grade, intermediate-grade, and high-grade. Low-grade NHL subtypes have a median survival of approximately 6.2 years and although initially chemosensitive become increasingly more treatment-resistant as demonstrated by decreasing remission durations seen with subsequent therapeutic intervention.  The vast majority of low-grade B-cell lymphomas are felt to be incurable with standard chemotherapy [2].  Therefore, new agents and treatment strategies need to be evaluated in these patients.
State-of-the-art treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) depends on the 
histologic type and stage. Recently, improvements in disease-free survival have been demonstrated in clinical trials (experimental therapy) that have improved on the best available accepted therapy (conventional or standard therapy) by combining them with novel target-specific agents (e.g. monoclonal antibodies [mAbs], etc.)  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were developed to target and kill tumors with less toxic effects on normal tissues.  MAbs directed against tumor-associated antigens, offer less non-specific toxicity than most chemotherapy agents.  One characteristic of monoclonal antibodies, is their ability to fix human complement and activate complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC).  Another mechanism of anti-tumor activity by mAbs is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through the binding of the Fc portion of the monoclonal antibodies to Fc receptors on lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and eosinophils.  Among human antibodies, IgG1 is the only class that binds to macrophage Fc receptors.  Clinical trials have evaluated a number of mAbs as potential treatments of hematological malignancies.  The results of these clinical trials have been highly variable [3].  Nevertheless, the results of some clinical trials of mAbs have shown promising activity and safety in patients with B-cell lymphomas that were (at times) resistant or refractory to conventional treatments.
Rituximab is the first mAb approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cancer.  It 
is a genetically engineered chimeric (human/murine) mAb with a human IgG1 constant region directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B cells.  A Phase III pivotal study demonstrated a 48% (80/166) APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 5 of 83overall response rate in previously treated low grade and follicular B-cell 
lymphoma patients receiving out-patient rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2/week 
for 4 weeks [4].  The median time to progression (TTP) was 13.1 months in responders.  The most common side effect seen was an infusion-related symptom complex consisting of fever and chills/rigors which occurred in the majority of patients during the first antibody infusion.  Rituximab has been combined with standard dose CHOP chemotherapy in a separate Phase II chemoimmunotherapy study in low grade NHL and demonstrated a 100% response rate with minimal additional toxicity than that typically seen with CHOP chemotherapy alone [5].  Furthermore, CHOP plus rituximab (CHOP-R) combination therapy has been evaluated in additional Phase II [6] and Phase III [7] studies.  In the Phase III study a statistically significant improvement in complete response (CR) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was found in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with CHOP-R, compared to those treated with CHOP alone.  Due to its unique immunologic mechanism(s) of action and good safety profile, rituximab has been studied in combination with other chemotherapeutic and/or biologic agents in an attempt to improve anti-tumor activity while decreasing the non-specific toxicities typically associated with a CHOP-like regimen alone. This current proposal plans to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combination of rituximab plus Pegfilgrastim.
Modulating the innate immune system is an attractive strategy to improve 
rituximab activity. It has been demonstrated by various groups of investigators not only that neutrophils play a significant role in rituximab activity but that priming neutrophils with cytokines augments rituximab anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical models. Clinical studies using G-CSF in combination with rituximab had shown improvement in complete response rates when compared to rituximab monotherapy historical controls. As pegfilgrastim possesses different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics than G-CSF, the biological interaction with rituximab might be stronger.  
1.2 Rituximab Background
Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody, with mouse variable and human 
IgG1 constant regions that recognizes the CD20 antigen expressed on normal B cells and most malignant B-cell lymphomas.  This antigen, important in cell cycle initiation and differentiation, is expressed strongly in over 90% of B-cell lymphomas [8].  Rituximab demonstrates specificity for CD20 and binds with an 
apparent affinity of 5.2 x 10
-9M.  In vitro mechanism of action studies have 
demonstrated that this antibody binds human complement and lyses lymphoid B cell lines and it has significant activity in assays for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity.  Rituximab has also been shown to have antiproliferative effects in titrated Thymidine incorporation assays and to directly induce apoptosis in several CD20-positive cell lines, while some other anti- CD20 antibodies do not [9].  High dose safety studies in cynomolgous monkeys have revealed no adverse clinical events.  There were no significant abnormalities on laboratory tests or on APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 6 of 83histopathological analysis.  As predicted, the biologic effect of rituximab is 
manifested by B-cell depletion in peripheral blood (PB), lymph nodes (LN) and bone marrow (BM).  Three weeks after 4 weekly doses there was a > 85% depletion of B cells in the lymph nodes and a > 75% decrease of B cells in the bone marrow.  Recovery of the B cells in the peripheral blood (to > 75% of baseline) usually occurred within 60 days following the last dose.
1.2.1 Clinical Experience
Initial human clinical trials were conducted primarily in patients with 
multiple relapses of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.  A Phase I, single-dose, dose-escalation trial demonstrated that rituximab was well 
tolerated at doses ranging from 10 to 500 mg/m
2.  The mean half-life (t 1/2) 
observed for rituximab in this study was 118 hours.  CD20+ B-cells were 
rapidly depleted 24-72 hours following rituximab administration and remained depleted for 2-3 months [10].  A subsequent Phase I/II, multiple-dose study demonstrated that a regimen of four weekly IV infusions of 
rituximab at doses of 125-375 mg/m
2 was equally well tolerated.  A total of 
37 patients received four doses of 375 mg/m2.  The overall response rate 
in this study was 50%, with a mean time to progression of 10.2 months [11].  
Adverse events reported in these studies have occurred largely with the 
first infusion.  Fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, and hypotension, generally of Grade 1 and 2 severities, have been reported.  These symptoms have typically responded to an interruption of the antibody infusion with subsequent resumption at a slower infusion rate.  Other adverse events have included transient neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and asthenia.
A large Phase III study of four weekly infusions of rituximab at 375 mg/m
2 
in patients with low-grade lymphoma has been completed.  In this open-label, single arm, pivotal trial, 166 patients received weekly x four 
infusions of 375 mg/m
2 of rituximab.  Adverse events (AE) were primarily 
related to the first infusion.  There was a marked reduction in the incidence of AEs in subsequent infusions.  (See Table 1 in the Rituximab 
Full Prescribing Information Booklet included in Appendix A for a list of 
possible adverse events).  None of the patients in this trial developed a significant human anti-chimeric antibody response (HACA) [4].
Ninety-one percent of patients (151 of 166) were evaluable for efficacy 
and an overall response rate of 48% with 6% CR and 42% PR was achieved.  The onset of response was documented as early as seven weeks and responses were seen in patients with bulky and extra nodal disease and in patients who had progressed following ABMT or anthracycline therapy.  CT scans of responders were reviewed and APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 7 of 83confirmed (blinded audit) by an independent panel of lymphoma experts 
following established response criteria.  Complete response required all lymph nodes to regress to < 1 x 1 cm and all signs and symptoms of 
disease to disappear.  Median time to progression for responders was subsequently reached at 13.1 months.
Various schedules of rituximab for initial therapy of advanced stage 
follicular lymphoma have been completed and, in general, demonstrate higher overall response and CR rates (range of ~70% ORR, 38 % CR) compared to patients receiving rituximab following prior chemotherapy.
An open-label, single-arm, Phase II study of six infusions of rituximab (375 
mg/m
2) interspersed among six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy has also 
been conducted in patients with low-grade lymphoma.  The overall response rate in the 35 evaluable patients who completed all of the planned treatment was 100%, with a CR rate of 63%. Seven of 8 patients noted to be positive for the bcl-2 marker by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) converted to bcl-2 negative in bone marrow and/or blood following treatment suggesting the clearance of minimal residual disease in these patients.  No significant additive toxicity was observed with the combination treatment [5].  Separate Phase II and Phase III studies of CHOP plus rituximab in intermediate-grade lymphoma have also demonstrated augmented anti-tumor activity without significant increases in toxicity [6, 7].  
Rituximab has been shown to be active in the treatment of CD20-positive 
indolent and aggressive lymphomas and has been noted to have a favorable toxicity profile both as a single agent and in combination with CHOP and other chemotherapy regimens.  The unique mechanism of action of rituximab supports its potential in augmenting anti-tumor activity when combined with other agents.  
1.2.2. Cellular mediated immunity and Rituximab anti-tumor activity.
Despite its evident clinical efficacy, some patients develop disease 
progression while on therapy with rituximab or relapse after initial response. Up to 50% of indolent NHL patients who have received prior chemotherapy treated with single agent rituximab fail to demonstrate an objective anti-tumor response (i.e. PR or CR). Several mechanisms for tumor resistance to monoclonal antibody therapy had been formulated. NHL related factors postulated are CD20-antigen density expression, complement inhibitory protein expression (e.g. CD55, CD54) by NHL cells and tumor burden. On the other hand, host-related factors such as pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics may play a significant role in patients that do not respond to rituximab. APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 8 of 83Several biological effects have been postulated as rituximab’s primary 
mechanism of anti-tumor activity [12-22]. Major areas of interest are the activation of the innate immune system and/or induction of apoptosis following rituximab therapy [12-21]. Recently published in vivo  studies 
demonstrate that Fc γR receptor expression is necessary to eradicate NHL 
in a murine animal model, suggesting that antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) plays a significant role in rituximab’s activity [21]. 
Furthermore, certain polymorphisms in the Fc γRIIIa gene have been 
associated with variable clinical and molecular response to anti-CD20 
mAb therapy in patients with indolent NHL [22]. 
FcR receptors mediate many of the cell-dependent functions of 
antibodies, including phagocytosis of antibody-bound antigens, activation of mast cells, complement activation and targeting/activation of natural 
killer (NK) cells.  There are three types of Fc ∂R receptors and eight 
subtypes. Fc γRI or CD64 (high affinity) mediates phagocytosis by 
macrophages and neutrophils. Fc γRIIb or CD32 (low affinity) that 
transduces inhibitory signals in B cells and finally Fc γRIIIa (CD16), 
another low affinity receptor mediates the activation of natural killer cells 
to induce ADCC.
Based on prior studies, some investigators postulate that NK cells and 
macrophages mediate the destruction of NHL cells by rituximab; primarily via antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The effects of neutrophils in tumor immunology may be largely underestimated. There is emerging evidence that polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) are capable of not only migrating and infiltrating cancerous tissues but also in inducing anti-tumor activity. 
We have demonstrated that neutrophil function is necessary for the anti-
tumor activity of rituximab in a lymphoma mouse model [23].  Two sets of experiments were performed. Initially, NK cells were depleted in all mice using an anti-IL-2 receptor antibody (SCID mice lack T and B lymphocytes) to ensure tumor engraftment. Neutrophils were depleted in 2 groups of mice through serial intraperitoneal injections of a rat-mAb against Ly-6G, a 21-25kDa GIP-anchored protein expressed specifically on granulocytes (myeloid differentiation Gr-1 antigen). Tumor growth was similar regardless of the presence or absence of circulating neutrophils in control mice (data not shown). Among rituximab-treated animals, anti-Gr-1 antibody treatment eliminated the anti-tumor effect observed with rituximab (Figure. 1A). 
To determine the contribution of NK cells to rituximab anti-tumor activity in 
NHL-bearing SCID mice we conducted a second series of experiments. NK cells were not depleted. All animals were inoculated with Raji cells via tail vein injection and half of the SCID mice underwent neutrophil APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 9 of 83depletion as described above. Subsequently, animals were randomized to 
receive rituximab or placebo. Again, rituximab-treated animals with intact NK cells had better survival than untreated animals with or without NK cells. Moreover, SCID mice with intact neutrophil and NK function had the best response to treatment with rituximab (Figure. 1B).
The results from these experiments demonstrated that effector cells are 
indispensable for the biological activity of rituximab. In order to exclude any potential anti-tumor activity that could be contributed by rituximab-mediated CMC and to further validate this hypothesis, we investigated whether rituximab could activate the murine complement system and lyse lymphoma cells in vitro . We conducted standard 
51Cr release assays in 
the human lymphoma cell lines DHL-4 using rituximab or trastuzumab (isotype control) with sera isolated from human versus SCID or BALB-c mice as the source of complement proteins (final dilution 1:8). In the DHL-4 cell lines therapy with anti-CD20 mAb was ineffective in inducing CMC in the presence of either SCID or BALBc (immunocompetent) mouse serum. Rituximab-induced CMC was only seen in the presence of human serum (60% of cell lysis).
1.3 Neutrophils and tumor immunology:
PMNs induce tumor destruction by several mechanisms. Tumor recruited 
neutrophils produce several cytotoxic mediators such as reactive oxygen species, proteases, membrane-perforating agents and soluble mediators of cell killing 
(TNFα, IL-β1 and INFs). A second mechanism of neutrophil-mediated anti-tumor Survival in Days120 100 80 60 40 20 0Cumulative  Survival1.2

inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity such as FcR γIIa FcRγIIIa and 
FcRγIIIb.
Recruitment of neutrophils into the tumor bed is a process that requires a series of 
coordinated interactions between PMNs and endothelial cells. During this process, PMNs undergo different phenotypical changes that result in an activated effector cell. It is well known that the expression of P-, E- and L-selectin (CD62) and other adhesion molecules such as IMAC-1 (CD11b/CD18) play an important role in neutrophil trafficking.  The interaction between neutrophil and other immune-effector cells activation and rituximab against B-cell malignancies and its relevance in the therapeutic strategies of NHL have not been extensively studied in the past.
1.4 Rationale for Rituximab and Pegfilgrastim:
We recently have proved that, host immune system activation by target-specific 
molecules such as G-CSF/GM-CSF enhances the biological activity of rituximab and potentially other mAbs [24]. To further explore the stimulation of effector cells as a strategy to enhance the biological activity of rituximab, we subsequently investigated the effects of in vivo  stimulation of innate immune cells with either 
murine G-CSF or GM-CSF on rituximab anti-tumor activity. NK cell-depleted SCID mice were inoculated by tail vein injection (tvi) with 1x10
6 Raji cells on day 0. 
Animals were divided into three groups to receive four intraperitoneal (ip) doses 
(from days +1 to +4) of placebo, 5 μg/day of murine (m)-GM-CSF or 5 μg/day of m-
G-CSF. Changes in CD11b/CD18 expression were performed by flow cytometric 
analysis of peripheral blood effector cells collected from each mouse. Subsequently, animals were subdivided to receive sequential  placebo or 
rituximab (10mg/kg) on days +5, +8, +11 and + 14 via tail vein injection. A separate set of experiments was performed to address dose-schedule of cytokine administration. Lymphoma-bearing SCID mice were divided into six cohorts: Group A received placebo; Group B received m-G-CSF; Group C received m-GM-CSF; Group D received rituximab, Group E received concurrently m-GCSF and rituximab; and Group F received concurrent m-GM-CSF and rituximab. MAb doses (10mg/kg) were administered via tvi on days +3, +7, +11 and +15. Murine cytokines were given concurrently via ip injection two consecutive days before 
each dose of rituximab. The end point of the study was overall survival. 
Treatment of lymphoma bearing SCID mice with rituximab resulted in significant 
higher anti-tumor activity and longer survival when compared with placebo controls. The median survival time for rituximab treated animals was 41 days (95%C.I. 30-52) in contrast to a median survival of 20 days (95% C.I. 20-20) for those animals receiving placebo (log rank test P < 0.001). No significant anti-tumor activity was observed in animals treated with either G-CSF or peg-GM-CSF alone, and the median survival was similar to control mice. The median survival for G-CSF treated SCID mice was 20 days (95% C.I. 19-20) and 21 days (95% C.I. 20-22) for those treated with peg-GM-CSF (P= 0.20).   APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 11 of 83The administration of murine G-CSF for two consecutive days prior to mAb 
therapy enhanced the anti-tumor activity of rituximab and doubled the mean survival of lymphoma-bearing mice. Statistically, significant differences were observed between animals treated with rituximab and G-CSF + rituximab. The mean survival time of animals treated with G-CSF and rituximab was longer [84 days (95% C.I. 75 to 93] than those treated with rituximab monotherapy [mean survival of 51 days (95%C.I. 37-64), log rank test P = 0.0036). After a median follow up time of three months, the median survival time for animals receiving rituximab in combination with G-CSF was not reached. (Figure 2A and 2B) 
The median survival for lymphoma-bearing SCID mice treated with rituximab and 
peg-GM-CSF was longer [62 days (95% C.I. 47-77)] when compared to rituximab treated animals [41 days (95%C.I. 30-52)]. Despite a trend towards improved survival, differences between rituximab-treated animals and those receiving the concurrent administration of rituximab in combination with peg-GM-CSF did not reach statistical significance (log rank P = 0.16). (Figure 3A and 3B)
After a follow up period of three months, survival rates were the highest for 
animals treated with rituximab and G-CSF (53.3%) when compared to animals treated with rituximab alone (13.3%) or in combination with peg-GM-CSF (26.67%). Pathological examination of all surviving animals at the end of the study failed to demonstrate any residual disease. days100 80 60 40 20 0cumulative survival1.2

Figure 2.  Kaplan Meier analysis of cumulative survival of SCID mice bearing raji lymphoma xenographs treated with 
rituximab and/or G-CSF.   Groups of 15 NK cell depleted SCID mice were inoculated with 1 x 106 raji cells via tail vein injection (iv) 
[day 0] and treated either with placebo, rituximab (10mg/kg iv on days +5, + 9, +13 and +17), G-CSF (10 μg/dose on days +3, +4,

two consecutive days before each rituximab dose) and analyzed for survival as function of time.  Significant anti-tumor activit y was 
observed among animals treated with rituximab or rituximab in combination with G-CSF (3A). The administration of G-CSF for two consecutive days prior to each mAb dose resulted in a statistically significant enhancement in the biological activity of ritux imab. The 
median survival of rituximab treated lymphoma bearing mice was only 41 days.  On the other hand, after a follow up period of 3 months, the median survival time for animals treated with rituximab in combination with G-CSF has not been reach (log rank P = 0.0036) (3B) APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 12 of 83The administration of m-GCSF or m-peg-GM-CSF for two consecutive days led to 
a significant increase in the number of circulating white cell blood (WBC), specifically granulocytes of lymphoma bearing SCID mice. Animals receiving m-GCSF had a higher mean WBC count of 7.58 x 10
3/mm3 (std. +/- 3.85 x 103/mm3) 
than unstimulated SCID mice in which the mean WBC was 0.6533 x 103/mm3 (std. 
+/- 0.23 x 103/mm3]) (chi-square P < 0.001). In addition and to a lesser degree, 
animals that received peg-m-GM-CSF had a higher mean peripheral WBC count of 3.5 x 10
3/mm3 (std. 1.3 x103/mm3) (chi-square P < 0.001). 
Differences were primarily due to the number circulating granulocytes. The mean 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was higher among SCID mice treated with either m-G-CSF (4.98 +/- 2.7 x10
3/mm3) (chi-square P < 0.001) or m-peg-GM-CSF (1.97 
+/- 1.41 x103/mm3) than in animals were unstimulated (0.38 +/- 0.26 x103/mm3) 
(chi-square P = NS).
Flow cytometric analysis performed from whole blood collected 48 hours after the 
administration of m-GSF or peg-m-GM-CSF show phenotypic changes in the expression of activation markers on granulocytes. SCID mice treated with either cytokine (G-CSF or peg-GM-CSF) had a higher expression of CD11b/CD18 when compared to placebo controls.

Figure 3.  Kaplan Meier analysis of cumulative survival of SCID mice bearing raji lymphoma xenographs treated with 
rituximab or peg-GM-CSF.   Groups of 15 NK cell depleted SCID mice were inoculated with 1 x 106 raji cells via tail vein injection 
(iv) [day 0] and treated either with placebo, rituximab (10mg/kg iv on days +5, + 9, +13 and +17), peg-GM-CSF (10 μg/dose on 
days +3, +4, +7, +8, +11,+12, +15 and +16), or rituximab (10mg/kg iv on days +5, + 9, +13 and +17) in combination with peg-GM-
CSF(10μg/daily for two consecutive days before each rituximab dose) and analyzed for survival as function of time.  Treatment 
with rituximab was effective in arresting lymphoma growth and prolonging the survival of raji lymphoma xenographs when 
compared to placebo or peg-GM-CSF (4A). The addition of peg-GM-CSF to rituximab therapy resulted in longer median survival  (62 days) when compared to rituximab single agent (median survival time of 41 days).

Page 14 of 83375mg/m2 weekly for four doses. The combination of G-CSF and rituximab was 
well tolerated and while the response rate was similar to historical rituximab monotherapy treated controls, the duration of response was longer [25]. Similarly to what we observed, G-CSF therapy resulted in an incremental increase in the neutrophil count of patients prior to rituximab therapy [25]. Notably, in contrast with our animal study results, a downregulation of CD11b/CD18 expression in circulating neutrophils were observed at 24 hours prior to rituximab therapy. Differences in the expression of CD11b/CD18 observed could be the result of inter-species variations in the degree and speed of neutrophil responsiveness and migration. 
The molecular basis for the effects of G-CSF on the anti-tumor activity of rituximab 
need to be fully defined. However, an increase in the trafficking of neutrophils into the tumor bed and enhancement of rituximab-mediated ADCC via upregulation of CD11b/CD18 likely play significant roles. Recently studies conducted in CD11b/CD18 deficient mice demonstrated that the capacity of neutrophils to induce ADCC against antibody-coated melanoma cells was impaired [26].  Another group of investigators have demonstrated changes in CD20 antigen expression following in vitro  exposure to various cytokines [27]. In our studies we 
could not demonstrate a significant upregulation of surface CD20 following in vitro  
exposure of lymphoma cells to either G-CSF or GM-CSF. Discrepancies between our results and those reported by Dr. Venugopal could be related to differences in cytokine dose, timing, and use of cell lines versus freshly isolated patient specimens.  A better understanding in the physiological events that occur following the administration of G-CSF and rituximab will hopefully lead to an improvement in rituximab-associated anti-tumor activity in patients with B-cell lymphoma.
1.6 Clinical Experience with Pegfilgrastim
Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) is a covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human 
G-CSF (Filgrastim) and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. Both Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are Colony Stimulating Factors that act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors thereby stimulating proliferation, differentiation, commitment, and end cell functional activation.
  Studies on cellular 
proliferation, receptor binding, and neutrophil function demonstrate that Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim have the same mechanism of action. Pegfilgrastim has reduced renal clearance and prolonged persistence in vivo as compared to Filgrastim.
Neulasta
® is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by 
febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Pegfilgrastim was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled studies.  
Studies 1 and 2 were active-controlled studies that employed doxorubicin 60 mg/m
2 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered every 21 days for up to 4 cycles for 
the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.[27,28] Study 1 investigated the utility of a fixed dose of pegfilgrastim. Study 2 employed a weight-adjusted dose. In the absence of growth factor support, similar chemotherapy regimens have been reported to result in a 100% incidence of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 0.5 x 10
9/L) with a mean duration of 5-7 days, and a 30%-40% 
incidence of febrile neutropenia. [29] In study 1, 157 subjects were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 6 mg of pegfilgrastim on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle or Filgrastim at 5 mcg/kg/day SC beginning on day 2 of each cycle. In study 2, 310 subjects were randomized to receive a single SC injection of pegfilgrastim at 100 mcg/kg on day 2 or Filgrastim at 5 mcg/kg/day SC beginning on day 2 of each cycle of chemotherapy.
Both studies met the primary objective of demonstrating that the mean days of 
severe neutropenia (ANC<0.5 x 10
9/L) of pegfilgrastim-treated patients did not 
exceed that of Filgrastim-treated patients by more than one day in cycle 1 of chemotherapy.  The rates of febrile neutropenia were 13% and 9% for pegfilgrastim vs. 20% and 18% for Filgrastim in studies 1 and 2, respectively. [27,28] Other secondary endpoints included days of severe neutropenia in cycles 2-4, the depth of ANC nadir in cycles 1-4, and the time to ANC recovery after nadir. In both studies, the results for the secondary endpoints were similar between the two treatment groups.
Study 3 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that employed 
docetaxel 100 mg/m
2 administered every 21 days for up to 4 cycles for the 
treatment of metastatic or non-metastatic breast cancer. In this study, 928 patients were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous injection of Neulasta
® 6 mg or 
placebo on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle. Study 3 met the primary objective of demonstrating that the incidence of febrile neutropenia (defined as temperature > 38.2°C and ANC < 0.5 x10
9/L) was lower for Neulasta®-treated patients as 
compared to placebo-treated patients (1% versus 17%, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalizations (1% versus 14%) and IV anti-infective use (2% versus 10%) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia were also lower in the Neulasta
®-treated 
patients compared with the placebo-treated patients. [30]
The safety and efficacy of once-per-cycle pegfilgrastim was also found to be 
comparable to daily Filgrastim in phase 2 studies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer being treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel and patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin’s lymphoma being treated with ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin) or CHOP APPROVED RP CI IRB

 DOSE-SCHEDULE AND FORMULATION :
 
Enrolled patients will receive Pegfilgrastim 6mg subcutaneously (sq) 3 days before each dose of 
rituximab. Monoclonal antibody therapy will consist of rituximab (Rituxan ®) administered 
intravenously (iv) at a dose of 375mg/m2 every other week for four doses and after 8 weeks every 2 
months for four additional doses. All patients are expected to receive a total of 8 doses of Pegfilgrastim and eight doses of rituximab (Rituxan®). The treatment will be administered over a total period of 39 weeks. 
The standard administration of rituximab single agent is 375mg/m
2 weekly x 4. However various 
schedules had been studied in clinical trials. Two “extended” regimens were studied by The Minnie Pearl Cancer Center and by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research. The first group studied the administration of rituximab at the standard dose of 375mg/m
2 weekly x 4 follow by maintenance 
rituximab at the same dose weekly x 4 every 6 months for 2 years. The second group compared the standard regimens of rituximab versus an extended 8 regimen consisting of rituximab administered at 375mg/m
2 weekly x 4 follow by 4 additional doses of rituximab (375mg/m2) every 8 
weeks starting 12 weeks after the completion of the induction rituximab therapy. In both studies there was a prolongation in the time to treatment failure compared to rituximab historical controls. However a survival advantage was not observed. 
In our current study we are seeking to study if by enhancing the innate immune system with 
pegfilgrastim, we can modulate rituximab activity without adding significant toxicity.  Because of the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim we decided to administer the first 4 doses of rituximab every 2 weeks instead of the standard weekly schedule. Based on pharmacokinetic data in early rituximab APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 19 of 83clinical trials, the modification in the first four doses of rituximab should not affect rituximab levels 
as the half life of this antibody is extremely long. The additional four doses are administered as previously done by the Swiss Group. It is important from the safety stand point to note that the Swiss schedule has been adopted by several Oncologist in the United States as their preferred schedule given the safety profile and better anti-tumor activity over the standard schedule of four doses of rituximab.

7.6. Correlative studies description:
In this particular study we will study the mechanisms by which pegfilgrastim may improve rituximab 
activity. In our preclinical studies using lymphoma cells lines and lymphoma xenografts, we found that G-CSF increases not only the number of neutrophils but also the expression of adhesion molecules such as CD11b that were partially responsible for the improvement in rituximab activity. Therefore we will conduct similar studies in enrolled patients that may validate our pre-clinical data.  
Various laboratory parameters will be analyzed for each patient enrolled in the study before 
treatment (baseline) and before each dose of rituximab. Laboratory studies will study the changes in neutrophils induced by Pegfilgrastim and will be correlated with clinical response and duration of response in each patient completing the study.
1. Phenotype changes in neutrophils: Flow cytometry will be analyzed for changes in the 
surface expression of CD11b/CD18, CD16, CD32 and CD64.  Differences in antigen density will be determined by mean fluorescence units.
2. Changes in the oxidative burst by neutrophils stimulated with Pegfilgrastim as measured 
by flow cytometry studies and measurement of free radicals in serum from patients treated with rituximab and Pegfilgrastim. Oxidative burst will be measured as by flow cytometry analysis. 
3. Functional Assays in vitro: ADCC assays: The capacity to lyse tumor cells in the presence 
of rituximab by Peripheral Blood mononuclear cells (PBMC’s) of each patient will be studied by standardized 
51Cr release assays.  Briefly 2 x106 lymphoma cells (Raji cells) will 
be labeled with 51Cr. Labeled cells will be then exposed to rituximab or isotype control 
(10μg/ml) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from each patient be at the 
intervals described above (Effector: Target ratio 40:1)51Cr-release was measured and the 
percentage of lysis was calculated using the following formula:
% Lysis = [CPM sample – CPM background/ CPM positive control – CPM background] * 100.
4. Monitor serum levels of INF α and TNF in patients treated with rituximab in combination 
with Pegfilgrastim.  Cytokines levels will be measured by flow cytometry in the Roswell 
Park Cancer Institute Flow Cytometry Department. 
In addition, patients with easily accessible lymphomatous lesions will be requested to undergo an 
excisional biopsy after completion of the first dose of Pegfilgrastim and rituximab (within 24 hrs after completion of the antibody infusion). Tissue will be analyzed for the following:
1. Infiltration of neutrophils into the tumor bed2. Changes in CD20 expression as determined by immunohistochemistry (L26 staining), flow 
cytometry, and Western blotting studies for evaluation of cell viability and evidence of apoptosis; comparison to pre-treatment lymphoma biopsy specimens
3. Pathological examination

agencies worldwide. Adverse events will be classified according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria  using the Toxicity Scale version CTCAE v3.0. 
8.1. Definitions
8.1.1 Adverse Event Classification Definitions
Adverse Event:
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or 
frequency from the baseline condition, abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including laboratory test abnormalities which are considered AEs if they:
•result in discontinuation from the study,
•require treatment or any other therapeutic intervention,
•require further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same 
procedure to confirm the abnormality),
•are associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by the investigator to 
have a significant clinical impact.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
•results in death,
•is life-threatening (The patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe),
•requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
or
•in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Note: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 26 of 83hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event:
An AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product.
Associated With the Use of the Drug:
An AE is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is 
possible, probable or very likely.
8.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Not related
An AE which is not related to the use of the drug.
Unlikely
An AE for which an alternative explanation is more likely - e.g. concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely.
Possible
An AE which might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation - e.g. 
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s) - is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
Probable
An AE which might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is 
suggestive (e.g. confirmed by dechallenge). An alternative explanation is less likely - e.g. concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).
Likely
An AE which is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably 
explained by an alternative explanation - e.g. concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  The relationship in time is very suggestive (e.g. it is confirmed by dechallenge and rechallenge).
8.2 Procedures
8.2.1  All Adverse Events
All AEs and SAEs experienced by enrolled patients for whom study drug is 
provided must be reported according to this procedure.  All AEs will be reported between the first trial related procedure and the last dose of study drug. Any AE that is ongoing must be followed for 90 days following the last trial related procedure.  Those meeting the definition of SAE must be reported between the 8/22/2017

the SAE Form. Patients should voluntarily report any AEs or in response to general, non-directed questioning (e.g., “How has your health been since the last visit?”). For each AE volunteered by the patient, the investigator should obtain all the information required to complete the AE page of the CRF, in accordance with the guidelines that accompany it.
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study 
therapy, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and on the CRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection”). Investigators must record on the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the AE to study therapy.  All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to Sponsor instructions.
The principal investigator assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs 
to the regulatory authorities. The Sponsor will also report to the investigator all serious AEs that are unlisted and associated with the use of the drug. The investigator must report these events to the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with local regulations.
8.2.2 Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs occurring during clinical trials must be reported within one working day 
(24 hours) to IRB.  This includes but is not limited to type, grade, action taken and relationship to the study medications.
The cause of death of a patient in a clinical trial, whether the event is expected or 
associated with the study drug, is an SAE.
The initial report of an SAE may be made by telephone or facsimile (FAX). The 
investigator must provide the minimal information: i.e. protocol number, patient’s initials and date of birth, patient number or medication code number, period of intake, nature of the adverse event and investigator’s attribution.
All oral reports of an SAE must be confirmed within three days by a written, more 
detailed report and signed by the investigator. For this purpose, the Sponsor will provide the investigator with the Serious Adverse Event Form.
All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved 
upon discontinuation of the patient’s participation in the study, must be followed until either:
•the event resolves, or
•the event stabilizes, or
•the event returns to baseline, if a baseline value is available, orAPPROVED RP CI IRB

8.2.3 Pregnancies
Pregnancies occurring between the first trial-related procedure and 90 days after 
the last trial-related procedure must be reported to IRB within one working day after the investigator or study staff has gained knowledge of them, using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be requested from Amgen’s Drug Safety and Surveillance (DSS).
All patients who become pregnant during participation in this trial must be promptly 
withdrawn from the trial.  
Although pregnancy is not an adverse event, manufacturers should be notified of 
pregnancies occurring on study.
8.3 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events related to study drug must be reported to Amgen 
Global Safety within one working day of discovery or notification of the event.  Use a MedWatch form or appropriate institutional form for reporting adverse events to Amgen.  Initial serious adverse event information and all follow-up information must be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event form and faxed using the Amgen Serious Adverse Event Report Cover Page to:
Amgen Global Safety (Fax: 888-814-8653 / Phone: 866-264-3650)The investigator should notify the IRB of serious adverse events occurring at the

8.4 Internal Data Safety and MonitoringThe same monitoring process in effect for all RPCI investigator initiated studies will 
monitor this trial. All patients on study are reviewed for any toxicity or other untoward events during the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are to 1) periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when appropriate, efficacy, and 2) make recommendations to the IRB concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial. 
The first review is planned to be conducted after the first six patients complete the 
proposed treatment.  Patient recruitment, accrual and retention will also be discussed at DSMB meetings as needed.  Toxicity is reported to the DSMB.The APPROVED RP CI IRB

9.3. Safety
The study will be conducted in two parts. Evaluation of the safety of rituximab and 
pegfilgrastim will be done after the collection of the first twenty patients (First part of the study). All patients who complete at least one dose of pegfilgrastim will be considered evaluable for safety analysis.  Patients who are not evaluable for safety will be replaced. The first twenty patients evaluable for safety will be used determine if the combination of rituximab and pegfilgrastim is tolerable.  This number of patients is sufficient to determine the safety of the combination.  The combination of rituximab and pegfilgrastim will be deemed tolerable if at least 75% of patients (15/20) tolerate the combination as measured by the absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT is defined as any grade >3 APPROVED RP CI IRB

toxicity at any time during protocol therapy that is related to the study drug combination. Isolated lymphopenia is expected following rituximab therapy as a result of peripheral B-cell depletion. The collection of twenty additional patients will take place only if this standard is met. All 40 subjects will be reviewed for safety.
Previously, other investigators had investigated the safety and efficacy of rituximab 
in combination with G-CSF in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. In that study the combination of rituximab and G-CSF was well tolerated. Adverse events, which occurred in 25/26 patients, were mainly consisted of (grade I/II) fever (29%) and allergic reactions (19%) [25]. In the present clinical study if during the first phase of enrollment, four (20%) patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) accrual of patients will stop and the combination of rituximab and pegfilgrastim will be determined intolerable. Safety will be monitored as described in section 7. 
9.4 Efficacy
Response to treatment for all patients will be assessed at weeks 11, 27, and 43.  
Responses will be confirmed within 4 months after completion of all therapy for all patients. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the overall response rate (ORR) at weeks 
11, 27, and 43.  Secondary endpoints are the complete response (CR), partial response (PR) rates at weeks 11, 27, and 43, the time to disease progression, and survival.  The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are largely based on radiological assessment of the tumor.  In addition, efficacy endpoints will be compared to historical previously published clinical data with rituximab given as a single agent (i.e. historical controls). 
9.4.1. Methodology
The primary patient population will be based on the intent-to-treat 
approach and will include all enrolled patients.  Patients who die as the result of disease progression or related complications before a tumor evaluation, or who take concomitant chemotherapeutic medication not specified in the protocol, or who withdraw from the study will be considered treatment failures.
The secondary patient population will include patients who complete the 
full treatment cycle. The full treatment cycle includes eight doses of rituximab and eight doses of pegfilgrastim administered over a 39 week period as described in table 1. 
Primary and Secondary analyses .  After the 43-week data from all 
patients enrolled have been entered into the database, an analysis of the response rates will be conducted.  The ORR, CR and PR rates will be estimated for all enrolled patients (intent-to-treat approach).  Two-sided 95% exact confidence intervals around the estimates will be calculated.
The estimate and the 95% exact confidence intervals of the ORR rate and 
the CR/PR rates will also be computed for evaluable patients only.  A detailed response status (complete response, partial response, stable, and progressive disease) will be summarized overall for the intent-to-treat and the evaluable populations.  All responses, regardless of the duration, will be included in the above analyses.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 31 of 83Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are time to disease progression 
and survival.  These will be analyzed after the 2- and 4-year data from all patients have been collected.  Time to progression is defined as date of progression/death/last contact - date treatment started.  Survival is defined as date of death/last contact - date treatment started.  If the specified event (death/progression) did not occur during the follow-up period, the above variables will be censored at the last contact date.
Descriptive statistics such as median, minimum, and maximum values will 
be used to summarize the time to event data.  Kaplan-Meier estimates will be used to present the time to progression data.  Correlation between response to treatment and immunological parameter gathered from the correlative studies will be performed by Cox regression analysis. 
A descriptive analysis of the correlative studies will be performed to define 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicty (ADCC) pre or post-pegfilgrastim/rituximab and CD20 cell levels.  The study parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations.  All data summaries based on these correlative studies will be descriptive and exploratory in nature, with the goal of developing further questions regarding the modulation of therapy, or regarding reasons for efficacy or lack of efficacy. 
Supportive Efficacy .  The supportive analysis will include 2-and 4-year 
survival estimates, overall performance on study (weight loss, change in Karnofsky Score), and exploratory analysis of the effects of baseline characteristics on response rates, time to progression, and survival.
9.5 Determination of Sample Size
Twenty patients will be used for the first end point which is safety evaluation and 
the primary analysis.  The standard error of the percentage of patients who did not experience a DLT will be at most 11 percentage points. With a sample size of 40 evaluable 
patients, the precision of the estimate of the ORR rate, which is reflected by the width of the 95% confidence interval, will be at most 31 percentage points.

For further details on rituximab including adverse reactions and warning, 
see appendix A. 
Severe Infusion Reactions (See BOXED WARNINGS , ADVERSE 
REACTIONS  and Hypersensitivity Reactions)
RITUXAN has caused severe infusion reactions. In some cases, these 
reactions were fatal. These severe reactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30 to 120 minutes. Signs and symptoms of severe infusion reactions may include hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia or bronchospasm, and may require interruption of RITUXAN administration. The most severe manifestations and sequelae include pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock. In the reported cases, the following factors were more frequently associated with fatal outcomes: female gender, pulmonary infiltrates, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or mantle cell lymphoma. 
Management of severe infusion reactions:  The RITUXAN infusion should 
be interrupted for severe reactions and supportive care measures instituted as medically indicated (e.g., intravenous fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen). In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved. Patients requiring close monitoring during first and all subsequent infusions include those with pre-existing cardiac and pulmonary conditions, those with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adverse events and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (> 
25,000/mm3) with or without evidence of high tumor burden.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 33 of 83Tumor Lysis Syndrome [TLS] (See BOXED WARNINGS  and 
ADVERSE REACTIONS ) Rapid reduction in tumor volume followed by 
acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or 
hyperphosphatasemia, have been reported within 12 to 24 hours after the first RITUXAN infusion. Rare instances of fatal outcome have been reported in the setting of TLS following treatment with RITUXAN. The risks of TLS appear to be greater in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (> 25,000/mm
3) or high tumor burden. Prophylaxis for TLS 
should be considered for patients at high risk. Correction of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function and fluid balance, and administration of supportive care, including dialysis, should be initiated as indicated. Following complete resolution of the complications of TLS, RITUXAN has been tolerated when re-administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for TLS in a limited number of cases.
Hepatitis B Reactivation with Related Fulminant Hepatitis and Other 
Viral Infections  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant 
hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with RITUXAN. The majority of patients received RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy. The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 4 months after the initiation of RITUXAN and approximately one month after the last dose.
Persons at high risk of HBV infection should be screened before initiation 
of RITUXAN. Carriers of hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection and for signs of hepatitis during and for up to several months following RITUXAN therapy. In patients who develop viral hepatitis, RITUXAN and any concomitant chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment including antiviral therapy initiated. There are insufficient data regarding the safety of resuming RITUXAN therapy in patients who develop hepatitis subsequent to HBV reactivation.
The following additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated or 
exacerbated, have been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. The majority of patients received RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These viral infections included JC virus [progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)], cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C. In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to one year following discontinuation of RITUXAN and have resulted in death.

Page 34 of 83respond to adjustments in the infusion rate and in medical management. 
Hypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema have occurred in association with RITUXAN infusion (see Severe Infusion Reactions). RITUXAN infusion should be interrupted for severe hypersensitivity reactions and can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved. Treatment of these symptoms with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen is recommended; additional treatment with bronchodilators or IV saline may be indicated. In most cases, patients who have experienced non-life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions have been able to complete the full course of therapy. (See DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION .) Medications 
for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine, 
antihistamines and corticosteroids, should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction during administration.
Cardiovascular  Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious 
or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of RITUXAN. Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions including arrhythmias and angina have had recurrences of these events during RITUXAN therapy and should be monitored throughout the infusion and immediate post-infusion period.
Renal (See BOXED WARNINGS : Tumor Lysis Syndrome [TLS] and 
ADVERSE REACTIONS ) RITUXAN administration has been associated 
with severe renal toxicity including acute renal failure requiring dialysis 
and in some cases, has led to a fatal outcome. Renal toxicity has occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (>25,000/mm
3) 
or high tumor burden who experience tumor lysis syndrome (see Tumor Lysis Syndrome) and in patients administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials. The combination of cisplatin and RITUXAN is not an approved treatment regimen. If this combination is used in clinical trials extreme caution  should be exercised; patients should be monitored 
closely for signs of renal failure. Discontinuation of RITUXAN should be considered for those with rising serum creatinine or oliguria. 
Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions (See BOXED WARNINGS ) 
Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, have been reported 
in patients treated with RITUXAN. These reports include paraneoplastic pemphigus (an uncommon disorder which is a manifestation of the patient's underlying malignancy),
18 Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid 
dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The onset of the reaction in the reported cases has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following RITUXAN exposure. Patients experiencing a severe mucocutaneous reaction should not receive any further infusions and seek prompt medical evaluation. Skin biopsy may help to distinguish among different mucocutaneous reactions and guide subsequent treatment. The APPROVED RP CI IRB

mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined.
Bowel Obstruction and Perforation  Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction 
and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL. In post-marketing reports, which include both patients with low-grade or follicular NHL and DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range 1–77) in patients with documented gastro-intestinal perforation. Complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.
Adverse Reactions
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.
The overall safety database for RITUXAN is based on clinical trial data 
from 1283 patients with NHL, who received RITUXAN either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Additional safety information was obtained from post-marketing safety surveillance. The most common adverse reactions were infusion reactions (see INFUSION REACTIONS below).
The following serious adverse reactions, some with fatal outcomes, have 
been reported in patients treated with RITUXAN (see BOXED 
WARNINGS  and WARNINGS ): severe or fatal infusion reactions, tumor 
lysis syndrome, severe mucocutaneous reactions, hepatitis B reactivation 
with fulminant hepatitis, other viral infections, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, renal toxicity, bowel obstruction and perforation.Except as noted, adverse events described below occurred in the setting of relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell, NHL and are based on 356 patients treated in nonrandomized, single-arm studies of RITUXAN administered as a single agent. Most patients received RITUXAN 375 mg/m
2 weekly for 4 doses.
Infusion Reactions (See BOXED WARNINGS  and WARNINGS )
Mild to moderate infusion reactions consisting of fever and chills/rigors 
occurred in the majority of patients during the first RITUXAN infusion. Other frequent infusion reaction symptoms included nausea, pruritus, angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, throat irritation, rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, and APPROVED RP CI IRB

minutes of beginning the first infusion, and resolved with slowing or interruption of the RITUXAN infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, IV saline, and vasopressors). The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion (77%) and decreased with each subsequent infusion (30% with fourth infusion and 14% with eighth infusion). Injection site pain was reported in less than 5% of patients.
Infectious Events (See WARNINGS : Hepatitis B Reactivation with 
Related Fulminant Hepatitis and Other Viral Infections)
RITUXAN induced B-cell depletion in 70% to 80% of patients and was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulins in a minority of patients; the lymphopenia lasted a median of 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days). Infectious events occurred in 31% of patients: 19% of patients had bacterial infections, 10% had viral infections, 1% had fungal infections, and 6% were unknown infections. Incidence is not additive because a single patient may have had more than one type of infection. Serious infectious events (Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, occurred in 2% of patients.
Hematologic Events
Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated with RITUXAN; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%). The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days). A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following RITUXAN therapy were reported.
Pulmonary Events
135 patients (38%) experienced pulmonary events in clinical trials. The most common respiratory system adverse events experienced were increased cough, rhinitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and sinusitis. In both clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance, there have been a limited number of reports of bronchiolitis obliterans presenting up to 6 months post-RITUXAN infusion and a limited number of reports of pneumonitis (including interstitial pneumonitis) presenting up to 3 months post-RITUXAN infusion, some of which resulted in fatal outcomes. The safety of resumption or continued administration of RITUXAN in patients with pneumonitis or bronchiolitis obliterans is unknown.
Immunogenicity
The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of APPROVED RP CI IRB

Freezing should be avoided; however, if accidentally frozen, pegfilgrastim should be allowed to thaw in the refrigerator before administration. If frozen a second time, pegfilgrastim should be discarded.  Pegfilgrastim should be visually inspected for discoloration and particulate matter before administration.  Pegfilgrastim should not be administered if discoloration or particulates are observed.  
Since pegfilgrastim provided for clinical trials contains no preservatives, 
prefilled syringes are designed for single use only. Contact your Amgen representative, or their designee, if storage conditions fall out of the specified range. Before investigational product that has been exposed to storage conditions out of the specified range can be used, Amgen’s Stability Department must issue a memo. This memo must be sent to and maintained at the site.
Records of the actual storage conditions during the period of the study 
must be maintained (eg, records of the date and time and initials of person checking, and the daily temperatures of the refrigerator used for storage of APPROVED RP CI IRB

10.2.6. Preparation and Administration
No preparation is required for administration of pegfilgrastim. Each subject 
will receive afixed dose of 6 mg of pegfilgrastim. The entire contents of the 0.6 mL prefilled syringe should be administered irrespective of the subject’s actual weight.
For method of administration please see patient package insert.
10.2.7. Adverse Reactions
In a placebo-controlled trial, bone pain occurred at a higher incidence in 
pegfilgrastim-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients (Pegfilgrastim, n = 467; Placebo, n = 461). The incidence of other commonly reported adverse events were similar in the pegfilgrastim- and placebo-treated patients, and were consistent with the underlying cancer diagnosis and its treatment with chemotherapy. Those adverse events occurred at rates between 48% and 10% in the pegfilgrastim treated patients and included: alopecia, bone pain, diarrhea, pyrexia (not including febrile neutropenia), myalgia, headache, arthralgia, vomiting, asthenia, edema peripheral, and constipation.
In the active controlled studies, common adverse events occurred at 
similar rates and severities in both treatment arms (Pegfilgrastim, n = 465; Filgrastim, n = 331). These adverse experiences occurred at rates between 72% and 15% and included: nausea, fatigue, alopecia, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, fever, anorexia, skeletal pain, headache, taste perversion, dyspepsia, myalgia, insomnia, abdominal pain, arthralgia, generalized weakness, peripheral edema, dizziness, granulocytopenia, stomatitis, mucositis, and neutropenic fever. 
Bone Pain
In the placebo-controlled study, the incidence of bone pain was 57% in Neulasta
®-treated patients compared to 50% in placebo-treated patients. 
Bone pain was generally reported to be of mild-to-moderate severity. 
Among patients experiencing bone pain, approximately 37% of 
Neulasta®- and 31% of placebo-treated patients utilized non-narcotic 
analgesics and 10% of Neulasta®- and 9% of placebo-treated patients 
utilized narcotic analgesics. 
In the active-controlled studies, the use of non-narcotic and narcotic 
analgesics in association with bone pain was similar between Neulasta®- 
and Filgrastim-treated patients. No patient withdrew from study due to bone pain. APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 42 of 83Laboratory Abnormalities
In clinical studies, leukocytosis (WBC counts > 100 x 109/L) was 
observed in less than 1% of 932 patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving Neulasta
®.  Leukocytosis was not associated with any adverse 
effects.  In the placebo-controlled study, reversible elevations in LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid that did not require treatment occurred at similar rates in Neulasta
®- and placebo-treated patients.
Overdosage
The maximum amount of Neulasta® that can be safely administered in 
single or multiple doses has not been determined. Single doses of 300 mcg/kg have been administered SC to 8 normal volunteers and 3 patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse effects. These subjects experienced a mean maximum ANC of 55 x 10
9/L, with 
a corresponding mean maximum WBC of 67 x 109/L. The absolute 
maximum ANC observed was 96 x 109/L with a corresponding absolute 
maximum WBC observed of 120 x 109/L. The duration of leukocytosis 
ranged from 6 to 13 days. Leukapheresis should be considered in the management of symptomatic individuals.
Toxicity/Warnings
Pegfilgrastim is contraindicated inpatients with known hypersensitivity to E 
coli-derived proteins, pegfilgrastim, Filgrastim, or any other component of 
the product.
Rare cases of splenic rupture have been reported following the 
administration of Neulasta
®. Splenic rupture, in some cases resulting in 
death, has also been associated with filgrastim, the parent compound of pegfilgrastim.  Patients receiving pegfilgrastim who report left upper abdominal and/or shoulder tip pain should be evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in 
neutropenic patients with sepsis receiving Filgrastim, the parent compound of pegfilgrastim, and is postulated to be secondary to an influx of neutrophils to sites of inflammation in the lungs. Neutropenic patients receiving pegfilgrastim who develop fever, lung infiltrates, or respiratory distress should be evaluated for the possibility of ARDS. In the event that ARDS occurs, pegfilgrastim should be discontinued and/or withheld until resolution of ARDS and patients should receive appropriate medical management for this condition. Moreover It is unknown if the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome with Rituximab will be higher with the use of pegfilgrastim.  APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 43 of 83Allergic reactions to pegfilgrastim, including anaphylaxis, skin rash, and 
urticaria, have been reported in post marketing experience. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. In some cases, symptoms recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. In rare cases, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, recurred within days after initial anti-allergic treatment was discontinued. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days. Pegfilgrastim should be permanently discontinued in patients with serious allergic reactions.
Severe sickle cell crises have been associated with the use of Neulasta
® 
in patients with sickle cell disease. Severe sickle cell crises, in some cases resulting in death, have also been associated with Filgrastim, the parent compound of pegfilgrastim. Only physicians qualified by specialized training or experience in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease should prescribe Neulasta
® for such patients, and only after 
careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits.  
Pregnancy and Lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The risks of the study drug to an unborn or newborn child are not known. In addition, it is not known whether pegfilgrastim is secreted in human milk. Therefore, pregnant or nursing mothers may not take part in this study.
Drug Interactions
No formal drug interaction studies between Neulasta
® and other drugs 
have been performed. Drugs such as lithium may potentiate the release of neutrophils; patients receiving lithium and Neulasta
® should have more 
frequent monitoring of neutrophil counts.

[Neulasta®] (pegfilgrastim) Prescribing Information
DESCRIPTION  
Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) is a covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human G-CSF 
(Filgrastim) and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. Filgrastim is a water-soluble 175 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19 kilodaltons (kD). Filgrastim is obtained from the bacterial fermentation of a strain of Escherichia coli transformed with a genetically engineered 
plasmid containing the human G-CSF gene. To produce pegfilgrastim, a 20 kD monomethoxypolyethylene glycol molecule is covalently bound to the N-terminal methionyl residue of Filgrastim. The average molecular weight of pegfilgrastim is approximately 39 kD. 
Neulasta
® is supplied in 0.6 mL prefilled syringes for subcutaneous injection. Each syringe contains 
6 mg pegfilgrastim (based on protein weight), in a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free solution (pH 4.0) containing acetate (0.35 mg), sorbitol (30.0 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.02 mg), and sodium (0.02 mg) in water for injection, USP. 
CLINICAL
 PHARMACOLOGY  
Both Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are Colony Stimulating Factors that act on hematopoietic cells by 
binding to specific cell surface receptors thereby stimulating proliferation, differentiation, 
commitment, and end cell functional activation.1,2 Studies on cellular proliferation, receptor binding, 
and neutrophil function demonstrate that Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim have the same mechanism of action. Pegfilgrastim has reduced renal clearance and prolonged persistence in vivo as compared to Filgrastim. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Neulasta
® were studied in 379 patients with 
cancer. The pharmacokinetics of Neulasta® were nonlinear in cancer patients and clearance 
decreased with increases in dose. Neutrophil receptor binding is an important component of the 
clearance of Neulasta®, and serum clearance is directly related to the number of neutrophils. For 
example, the concentration of Neulasta® declined rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery that 
followed myelosuppressive chemotherapy. In addition to numbers of neutrophils, body weight appeared to be a factor. Patients with higher body weights experienced higher systemic exposure 
to Neulasta® after receiving a dose normalized for body weight. A large variability in the 
pharmacokinetics of Neulasta® was observed in cancer patients. The half-life of Neulasta® ranged 
from 15 to 80 hours after subcutaneous injection. 
Special Populations 
No gender-related differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of Neulasta®, and no 
differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of geriatric patients ( ≥ 65 years of age) APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 50 of 83compared to younger patients (< 65 years of age) (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use). In a study 
of 30 patients with varying degrees of renal dysfunction including end-stage renal disease, renal dysfunction had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary. The pharmacokinetic profile in pediatric populations or in patients with hepatic insufficiency has not been assessed. 
CLINICAL STUDIES 
Neulasta
® was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled studies. Studies 1 and 2 
were active-controlled studies that employed doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 
administered every 21 days for up to 4 cycles for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Study 
1 investigated the utility of a fixed dose of Neulasta®. Study 2 employed a weight-adjusted dose. In 
the absence of growth factor support, similar chemotherapy regimens have been reported to result 
in a 100% incidence of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 0.5 x 109/L) with a 
mean duration of 5-7 days, and a 30%-40% incidence of febrile neutropenia. Based on the correlation between the duration of severe neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia found in studies with Filgrastim, duration of severe neutropenia was chosen as the primary 
endpoint in both studies, and the efficacy of Neulasta
® was demonstrated by establishing 
comparability to Filgrastim-treated patients in the mean days of severe neutropenia. 
In Study 1, 157 patients were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous injection of Neulasta® 6 
mg on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle or daily subcutaneous Filgrastim 5 mcg/kg/day beginning on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle. In Study 2, 310 patients were randomized to receive a 
single subcutaneous injection of Neulasta® 100 mcg/kg on day 2 or daily subcutaneous Filgrastim 5 
mcg/kg/day beginning on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle. 
Both studies met the primary objective of demonstrating that the mean days of severe neutropenia 
of Neulasta®-treated patients did not exceed that of Filgrastim-treated patients by more than one 
day in cycle 1 of chemotherapy (see Table 1). The rates of febrile neutropenia in the two studies 
were comparable for Neulasta® and Filgrastim (in the range of 10% to 20%). Other secondary 
endpoints included days of severe neutropenia in cycles 2-4, the depth of ANC nadir in cycles 1-4, and the time to ANC recovery after nadir. In both studies, the results for the secondary endpoints were similar between the two treatment groups.

metastatic breast cancer. In this study, 928 patients were randomized to receive a single 
subcutaneous injection of Neulasta® 6 mg or placebo on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle. Study 
3 met the primary objective of demonstrating that the incidence of febrile neutropenia (defined as 
temperature ≥ 38.2°C and ANC ≤ 0.5 x109/L) was lower for Neulasta®-treated patients as 
compared to placebo-treated patients (1% versus 17%, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalizations (1% versus 14%) and IV anti-infective use (2% versus 10%) for the treatment of 
febrile neutropenia were also lower in the Neulasta®-treated patients compared with the placebo-
treated patients. 
INDICATIONS  AND  USAGE  
Neulasta® is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, 
in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia (See CLINICAL STUDIES). 
CONTRAINDICATIONS
 
Neulasta® is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to E coli-derived proteins‚ 
pegfilgrastim‚ Filgrastim, or any other component of the product. 
WARNINGS  
General 
The safety and efficacy of Neulasta® for peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization has 
not been evaluated in adequate and well-controlled studies. Neulasta® should not be used for 
PBPC mobilization. 
Splenic Rupture 
Rare cases of splenic rupture have been reported following the administration of neulasta®. Splenic 
rupture, in some cases resulting in death, has also been associated with filgrastim, the parent 
compound of neulasta®.  Patients receiving neulasta® who report left upper abdominal and/or 
shoulder tip pain should be evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 
Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 
Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in neutropenic patients with sepsis 
receiving Filgrastim, the parent compound of Neulasta®, and is postulated to be secondary to an 
influx of neutrophils to sites of inflammation in the lungs. Neutropenic patients receiving Neulasta® APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 52 of 83who develop fever, lung infiltrates, or respiratory distress should be evaluated for the possibility of 
ARDS. In the event that ARDS occurs, Neulasta® should be discontinued and/or withheld until 
resolution of ARDS and patients should receive appropriate medical management for this condition. 
Allergic Reactions 
Allergic reactions to Neulasta®, including anaphylaxis, skin rash, and urticaria, have been reported 
in post marketing experience. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. In some cases, symptoms recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. In rare cases, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, recurred within days after initial anti-allergic treatment was discontinued. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered, with 
close patient follow-up over several days. Neulasta
® should be permanently discontinued in 
patients with serious allergic reactions. 
Sickle Cell Disease 
Severe sickle cell crises have been associated with the use of Neulasta® in patients with sickle cell 
disease. Severe sickle cell crises, in some cases resulting in death, have also been associated with Filgrastim, the parent compound of pegfilgrastim. Only physicians qualified by specialized training or experience in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease should prescribe 
Neulasta
® for such patients, and only after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits. 
PRECAUTIONS  
General 
Use With Chemotherapy and/or Radiation Therapy 
Neulasta® should not be administered in the period between 14 days before and 24 hours after 
administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) because of the potential for an increase in sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
The use of Neulasta® has not been studied in patients receiving chemotherapy associated with 
delayed myelosuppression (eg, nitrosoureas, mitomycin C).
The administration of Neulasta® concomitantly with 5-fluorouracil or other antimetabolites has not 
been evaluated in patients. Administration of pegfilgrastim at 0, 1, and 3 days before 5-fluorouracil resulted in increased mortality in mice; administration of pegfilgrastim 24 hours after 5-fluorouracil did not adversely affect survival. 
The use of Neulasta
® has not been studied in patients receiving radiation therapy. 
Potential Effect on Malignant Cells 
Pegfilgrastim is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils and neutrophil precursors; 
however, the G-CSF receptor through which pegfilgrastim and Filgrastim act has been found on tumor cell lines, including some myeloid, T-lymphoid, lung, head and neck, and bladder tumor cell APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 53 of 83lines. The possibility that pegfilgrastim can act as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be 
excluded. Use of Neulasta® in myeloid malignancies and myelodysplasia (MDS) has not been 
studied. In a randomized study comparing the effects of the parent compound of Neulasta®, 
Filgrastim, to placebo in patients undergoing remission induction and consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, important differences in remission rate between the two arms were excluded. Disease-free survival and overall survival were comparable; however, the study was not 
designed to detect important differences in these endpoints.

Information for Patients 
Patients should be informed of the possible side effects of Neulasta®, and be instructed to report 
them to the prescribing physician. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of allergic drug reactions and be advised of appropriate actions. Patients should be counseled on the 
importance of compliance with their Neulasta® treatment, including regular monitoring of blood 
counts. 
If it is determined that a patient or caregiver can safely and effectively administer Neulasta® 
(pegfilgrastim) at home, appropriate instruction on the proper use of Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) 
should be provided for patients and their caregivers, including careful review of the “Information for Patients and Caregivers” insert. Patients and caregivers should be cautioned against the reuse of needles, syringes, or drug product, and be thoroughly instructed in their proper disposal. A puncture-resistant container for the disposal of used syringes and needles should be available. 
Laboratory Monitoring 
To assess a patient’s hematologic status and ability to tolerate myelosuppressive chemotherapy, a 
complete blood count and platelet count should be obtained before chemotherapy is administered. Regular monitoring of hematocrit value and platelet count is recommended.
Drug Interaction 
No formal drug interaction studies between Neulasta
® and other drugs have been performed. 
Drugs such as lithium may potentiate the release of neutrophils; patients receiving lithium and 
Neulasta® should have more frequent monitoring of neutrophil counts. 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
No mutagenesis studies were conducted with pegfilgrastim. The carcinogenic potential of 
pegfilgrastim has not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. In a toxicity study of 6 months duration in rats given once weekly subcutaneous injections of up to 1000 mcg/kg of pegfilgrastim (approximately 23-fold higher than the recommended human dose), no precancerous or cancerous lesions were noted. 
When administered once weekly via subcutaneous injections to male and female rats at doses up 
to 1000 mcg/kg prior to, and during mating, reproductive performance, fertility, and sperm assessment parameters were not affected. APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 54 of 83Pregnancy Category C 
Pegfilgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits when administered 
subcutaneously every other day during gestation at doses as low as 50 mcg/kg/dose (approximately 4-fold higher than the recommended human dose). Decreased maternal food consumption, accompanied by a decreased maternal body weight gain and decreased fetal body weights were observed at 50 to 1000 mcg/kg/dose. Pegfilgrastim doses of 200 and 250 mcg/kg/dose resulted in an increased incidence of abortions. Increased post-implantation loss due to early resorptions was observed at doses of 200 to 1000 mcg/kg/dose, and decreased numbers of live rabbit fetuses were observed at pegfilgrastim doses of 200 to 1000 mcg/kg/dose, given every other day. 
Subcutaneous injections of pegfilgrastim of up to 1000 mcg/kg/dose every other day during the 
period of organogenesis in rats were not associated with an embryotoxic or fetotoxic outcome. However, an increased incidence (compared to historical controls) of wavy ribs was observed in rat fetuses at 1000 mcg/kg/dose every other day. Very low levels (< 0.5%) of pegfilgrastim crossed the placenta when administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats every other day during gestation. 
Once weekly subcutaneous injections of pegfilgrastim to female rats from day 6 of gestation 
through day 18 of lactation at doses up to 1000 mcg/kg/dose did not result in any adverse maternal effects. There were no deleterious effects on the growth and development of the offspring and no adverse effects were found upon assessment of fertility indices. There are no adequate and well-
controlled studies in pregnant women. Neulasta
® should be used during pregnancy only if the 
potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
Nursing Mothers 
It is not known whether pegfilgrastim is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted 
in human milk‚ caution should be exercised when Neulasta® is administered to a nursing woman. 
Pediatric Use 
The safety and effectiveness of Neulasta® in pediatric patients have not been established. The 6 
mg fixed dose single-use syringe formulation should not be used in infants, children, and smaller adolescents weighing less than 45 kg. 
Geriatric Use 
Of the 932 patients with cancer who received Neulasta® in clinical studies, 139 (15%) were age 65 
and over, and 18 (2%) were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients age 65 and older and younger patients. 
ADVERSE
 REACTIONS  
See WARNINGS sections regarding Splenic Rupture, ARDS, Allergic Reactions, and Sickle Cell 
Disease. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction 
rates observed in the clinical trials of Neulasta® cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical 
trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 55 of 83information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that 
appear to be related to Neulasta® use and for approximating rates. 
The data described below reflect exposure to Neulasta® in 932 patients. Neulasta® was studied in 
placebo- and active-controlled trials (n = 467, and n = 465, respectively). The population encompassed an age range of 21 to 88 years. Ninety-two percent of patients were female. The ethnicity of the patients was as follows: 75% Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, 5% Black, and 1% Asian. Patients with solid tumors (breast [n = 823], lung and thoracic tumors [n = 53]) or lymphoma (n = 
56) received Neulasta
® after nonmyeloablative cytotoxic chemotherapy. Most patients received a 
single 100 mcg/kg (n = 259) or a single 6 mg (n = 546) dose per chemotherapy cycle over 4 cycles. 
In the placebo-controlled trial, bone pain occurred at a higher incidence in Neulasta®-treated 
patients as compared to placebo-treated patients. The incidence of other commonly reported 
adverse events were similar in the Neulasta®- and placebo-treated patients, and were consistent 
with the underlying cancer diagnosis and its treatment with chemotherapy. The data in Table 2 
reflect those adverse events occurring in at least 10% of patients treated with Neulasta® in the 
placebo-controlled study.

Page 56 of 83In the active controlled studies, common adverse events occurred at similar rates and severities in 
both treatment arms (Neulasta®, n = 465; Filgrastim, n = 331). These adverse experiences 
occurred at rates between 72% and 15% and included: nausea, fatigue, alopecia, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, fever, anorexia, skeletal pain, headache, taste perversion, dyspepsia, myalgia, insomnia, abdominal pain, arthralgia, generalized weakness, peripheral edema, dizziness, granulocytopenia, stomatitis, mucositis, and neutropenic fever. 
Bone Pain The analysis of bone pain described below is based on a composite analysis using multiple, 
related, adverse event terms. 
In the placebo-controlled study, the incidence of bone pain was 57% in Neulasta
®-treated patients 
compared to 50% in placebo-treated patients. Bone pain was generally reported to be of mild-to-moderate severity. 
Among patients experiencing bone pain, approximately 37% of Neulasta®- and 31% of placebo-
treated patients utilized non-narcotic analgesics and 10% of Neulasta®- and 9% of placebo-treated 
patients utilized narcotic analgesics.
In the active-controlled studies, the use of non-narcotic and narcotic analgesics in association with 
bone pain was similar between Neulasta®- and Filgrastim-treated patients. No patient withdrew 
from study due to bone pain. 
Laboratory Abnormalities 
In clinical studies, leukocytosis (WBC counts > 100 x 109/L) was observed in less than 1% of 932 
patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving Neulasta®. Leukocytosis was not associated with 
any adverse effects. 
In the placebo-controlled study, reversible elevations in LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid 
that did not require treatment occurred at similar rates in Neulasta®- and placebo-treated patients. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The incidence of antibody 
development in patients receiving Neulasta® has not been adequately determined. While available 
data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. No neutralizing antibodies have been detected using a cell-based bioassay in 46 patients who apparently developed binding antibodies. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to 
Neulasta
® with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 
Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported 
on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors. There is a theoretical APPROVED RP CI IRB

CSF, resulting in immune-mediated neutropenia, but this has not been observed in clinical studies. 
OVERDOSAGE  
The maximum amount of Neulasta® that can be safely administered in single or multiple doses has 
not been determined. Single subcutaneous doses of 300 mcg/kg have been administered to 8 healthy volunteers and 3 patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse effects. 
These patients experienced a mean maximum ANC of 55 x 109/L, with a corresponding mean 
maximum WBC of 67 x 109/L. The absolute maximum ANC observed was 96 x 109/L with a 
corresponding absolute maximum WBC observed of 120 x 109/L. The duration of leukocytosis 
ranged from 6 to 13 days. Leukapheresis should be considered in the management of symptomatic individuals. 
DOSAGE
 AND  ADMINISTRATION  
The recommended dosage of Neulasta® is a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg administered 
once per chemotherapy cycle. Neulasta® should not be administered in the period between 14 days 
before and 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy (see PRECAUTIONS). 
The 6 mg fixed-dose formulation should not be used in infants, children, and smaller adolescents 
weighing less than 45 kg. 
No dosing adjustment is necessary for renal dysfunction (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, 
Special Populations). 
Neulasta® should be visually inspected for discoloration and particulate matter before 
administration. Neulasta® should not be administered if discoloration or particulates are observed. 
For method of administration please see patient package insert. 
Storage 
Neulasta® should be stored refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F); syringes should be kept in their 
carton to protect from light until time of use. Shaking should be avoided. Before injection‚ Neulasta® 
may be allowed to reach room temperature for a maximum of 48 hours but should be protected from light. Neulasta
® left at room temperature for more than 48 hours should be discarded. 
Freezing should be avoided; however, if accidentally frozen, Neulasta® should be allowed to thaw 
in the refrigerator before administration. If frozen a second time, Neulasta® should be discarded. 
HOW  SUPPLIED

DESCRIPTION
The RITUXAN® (Rituximab) antibody is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. The antibody is an IgG
1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine light- 
and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences. Rituximab is composed of two heavy chains of 451 amino acids and two light chains of 213 amino acids (based on cDNA analysis) and has an approximate molecular weight of 145 kD. Rituximab has a binding affinity for the CD20 antigen of approximately 8.0 nM.
The chimeric anti-CD20 antibody is produced by mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) 
suspension culture in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin. Gentamicin is not detectable in the final product. The anti-CD20 antibody is purified by affinity and ion exchange chromatography. The purification process includes specific viral inactivation and removal procedures. Rituximab drug product is manufactured from bulk drug substance manufactured by Genentech, Inc. (US License No. 1048).
RITUXAN is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid concentrate for intravenous (IV) 
administration. RITUXAN is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use vials. The product is formulated for IV administration in 9 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted to 6.5.

cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL),3 but is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, 
normal plasma cells or other normal tissues.4 CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation 
process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation,4 and possibly functions as a calcium ion 
channel.5 CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding.6 
Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation.2
Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology
Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of Rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, 
and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro . Possible 
mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)7 and antibody-
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.
8
Normal Tissue Cross reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.
Human Pharmacokinetics/PharmacodynamicsIn patients given single doses at 10, 50, 100, 250 or 500 mg/m
2 as an IV infusion, serum levels and 
the half-life of Rituximab were proportional to dose.9 In 14 patients given 375 mg/m2 as an IV 
infusion for 4 weekly doses, the mean serum half-life was 76.3 hours (range, 31.5 to 152.6 hours) after the first infusion and 205.8 hours (range, 83.9 to 407.0 hours); after the fourth infusion.
10,11,12 
The wide range of half-lives may reflect the variable tumor burden among patients and the changes in CD20-positive (normal and malignant) B-cell populations upon repeated administrations.
RITUXAN at a dose of 375 mg/m
2 was administered as an IV infusion at weekly intervals for 4 
doses to 203 patients naive to RITUXAN.12,13 The mean C max following the fourth infusion was 486 
μg/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 μg/mL). The peak and trough serum levels of Rituximab were 
inversely correlated with baseline values for the number of circulating CD20-positive B cells and measures of disease burden. Median steady-state serum levels were higher for responders compared with nonresponders; however, no difference was found in the rate of elimination as measured by serum half-life. Serum levels were higher in patients with International Working Formulation (IWF) subtypes B, C, and D as compared with those with subtype A.
10,13 Rituximab 
was detectable in the serum of patients 3 to 6 months after completion of treatment.
RITUXAN at a dose of 375 mg/m2 was administered as an IV infusion at weekly intervals for 8 
doses to 37 patients.14 The mean C max after 8 infusions was 550 μg/mL (range, 171 to 1177 
μg/mL). The mean C max increased with each successive infusion through the eighth infusion (Table

The pharmacokinetic profile of RITUXAN when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in 
combination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with RITUXAN alone.15
Administration of RITUXAN resulted in a rapid and sustained depletion of circulating and tissue-based B cells. Lymph node biopsies performed 14 days after therapy showed a decrease in the percentage of B cells in seven of eight patients who had received single doses of Rituximab >100 
mg/m2. 9 Among the 166 patients in the pivotal study, circulating B cells (measured as CD19-
positive cells) were depleted within the first three doses with sustained depletion for up to 6 to 9 months post-treatment in 83% of patients.
13 Of the responding patients assessed (n = 80), 1% 
failed to show significant depletion of CD19-positive cells after the third infusion of Rituximab as compared to 19% of the nonresponding patients. B-cell recovery began at approximately 6 months following completion of treatment. Median B-cell levels returned to normal by 12 months following completion of treatment.
13
There were sustained and statistically significant reductions in both IgM and IgG serum levels observed from 5 through 11 months following Rituximab administration. However, only 14% of patients had reductions in IgM and/or IgG serum levels, resulting in values below the normal range.

infusion weekly for 4 doses.13 Patients with tumor masses >10 cm or with >5,000 lymphocytes/ μL 
in the peripheral blood were excluded from the study. Results are summarized in Table 2. The 
median time to onset of response was 50 days and the median duration of response was 11.2 months (range, 1.9 to 42.1+). Disease-related signs and symptoms (including B-symptoms) were present in 23% (39/166) of patients at study entry and resolved in 64% (25/39) of those patients.
In a multivariate analysis, the ORR was higher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histologic subtypes 
as compared to IWF subtype A (58% vs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was <5 cm vs. >7 cm (maximum, 21 cm) in greatest diameter (53% vs. 38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared with chemoresistant (defined as duration of response <3 months) relapse (53% vs. 36%). ORR in patients previously treated with autologous bone marrow transplant was 78% (18/23). The following adverse prognostic factors were not associated with a 
lower response rate: age >60 years, extranodal disease, prior anthracycline therapy, and bone 
marrow involvement.
Weekly for 8 Doses  In a multicenter, single-arm study, 37 patients with relapsed or refractory, low-
grade NHL received 375 mg/m2 of RITUXAN weekly for 8 doses. Results are summarized in Table 
2. (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Risk Factors Associated with Increased Rates of Adverse 
Events.)
Bulky Disease, Weekly for 4 Doses  In pooled data from multiple studies of RITUXAN, 39 patients 
with relapsed or refractory, bulky disease (single lesion >10 cm in diameter), low-grade NHL received 375 mg/m

Retreatment Weekly for 4 Doses  In a multi-center, single-arm study, 60 patients received 375 
mg/m2 of RITUXAN weekly for 4 doses.17 All patients had relapsed or refractory, low-grade or 
follicular B-cell NHL and had achieved an objective clinical response to RITUXAN administered 3.8-35.6 months (median 14.5 months) prior to retreatment with RITUXAN. Of these 60 patients, 55 received their second course of RITUXAN, 3 patients received their third course and 2 patients received their second and third courses of RITUXAN in this study. Results are summarized in Table 2.
Diffuse, Large B-Cell, NHLThe safety and effectiveness of RITUXAN were evaluated in three, randomized, active-controlled, 
open-label, multicenter studies with a collective enrollment of 1854 patients. Patients with previously untreated diffuse, large B-cell, NHL received RITUXAN in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens.
Study 1. A total of 632 patients aged >60 years with either B-cell NHL Grade F, G, or H by the 
International Working Formulation classification or DLBCL (including primary mediastinal B-cell 
lymphoma) in the REAL classification were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with CHOP or R-CHOP. Patients were given 6 or 8, 21 day cycles of CHOP. Patients in the R-CHOP arm also received 4 or 5 doses of RITUXAN 375 mg/m
2 on Days -7 and -3 (prior to Cycle 1), and 48 to 72 
hours pre-Cycle 3, pre-Cycle 5, and pre-Cycle 7 for patients receiving 8 cycles of CHOP induction. The main outcome measure of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first of progression, relapse or death. Responding patients underwent a second randomization to receive RITUXAN or no further therapy.
Among all enrolled patients, 62% had centrally confirmed DLBCL histology, 73% had Stage III-IV 
disease, 56% had IPI scores >2, 86% had ECOG performance status of <2, 57% had elevated 
LDH levels, and 30% had two or more extranodal disease sites involved. Efficacy results are presented in Table 3. These results reflect a statistical approach which allows for an evaluation of RITUXAN administered in the induction setting that excludes any potential impact of RITUXAN given after the second randomization.
Analysis of results after the second randomization in Study 1 demonstrates that for patients 
randomized to R-CHOP, additional RITUXAN exposure beyond induction was not associated with further improvements in progression free survival or overall survival.
Study 2. A total of 399 patients with DLBCL, aged >60 years, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive CHOP or R-CHOP induction. All patients received up to 8, 3-week cycles of CHOP 
induction; patients in the R-CHOP arm received RITUXAN 375 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each cycle. The 
main outcome measure of the study was event free survival (EFS), defined as the time from randomization to relapse, progression, change in therapy or death from any cause. Among all enrolled patients, 80% had stage III or IV disease, 60% of patients had an age-adjusted IPI >2, APPROVED RP CI IRB

RITUXAN is contraindicated in patients with known anaphylaxis or IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to murine proteins or to any component of this product. (See WARNINGS.)
WARNINGS (See BOXED WARNINGS.) 
Severe Infusion Reactions (See BOXED WARNINGS, ADVERSE REACTIONS and 
Hypersensitivity Reactions)
RITUXAN has caused severe infusion reactions. In some cases, these reactions were fatal. These 
severe reactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30 to 120 minutes. Signs and symptoms of severe infusion reactions may include hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia or bronchospasm, and may require interruption of RITUXAN administration. The most severe manifestations and sequelae include pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock. In the reported cases, the following factors were more frequently associated with fatal outcomes: female gender, pulmonary infiltrates, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or mantle cell lymphoma. 
Management of severe infusion reactions:  The RITUXAN infusion should be interrupted for severe 
reactions and supportive care measures instituted as medically indicated (e.g., intravenous fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen). In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved. Patients requiring close monitoring during first and all subsequent infusions include those with pre-existing cardiac and pulmonary conditions, those with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adverse events and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (> 25,000/mm
3) with or without evidence of high tumor burden.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome [TLS] (See BOXED WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS)  Rapid 
reduction in tumor volume followed by acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, 
hyperuricemia, or hyperphosphatasemia, have been reported within 12 to 24 hours after the first RITUXAN infusion. Rare instances of fatal outcome have been reported in the setting of TLS following treatment with RITUXAN. The risks of TLS appear to be greater in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (> 25,000/mm
3) or high tumor burden. Prophylaxis for TLS 
should be considered for patients at high risk. Correction of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function and fluid balance, and administration of supportive care, including dialysis, should be initiated as indicated. Following complete resolution of the complications of TLS, RITUXAN has been tolerated when re-administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for TLS in a limited number of cases.
Hepatitis B Reactivation with Related Fulminant Hepatitis and Other Viral Infections  Hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with RITUXAN. The majority of patients received RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy. The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 4 months after the initiation of RITUXAN and approximately one month after the last dose.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 66 of 83Persons at high risk of HBV infection should be screened before initiation of RITUXAN. Carriers of 
hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection and for signs of hepatitis during and for up to several months following RITUXAN therapy. In patients who develop viral hepatitis, RITUXAN and any concomitant chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment including antiviral therapy initiated. There are insufficient data regarding the safety of resuming RITUXAN therapy in patients who develop hepatitis subsequent to HBV reactivation.
The following additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated or exacerbated, have been 
identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. The majority of patients received RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These viral infections included JC virus [progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)], cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus,West Nile virus, and hepatitis C. In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to one year following discontinuation of RITUXAN and have resulted in death.
Hypersensitivity Reactions  RITUXAN has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions (non-
IgE-mediated reactions) which may respond to adjustments in the infusion rate and in medical management. Hypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema have occurred in association with RITUXAN infusion (see Severe Infusion Reactions). RITUXAN infusion should be interrupted for severe hypersensitivity reactions and can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved. Treatment of these symptoms with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen is recommended; additional treatment with bronchodilators or IV saline may be indicated. In most cases, patients who have experienced non-life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions have been able to complete the full course of therapy. (See DOSAGE 
and ADMINISTRATION.) Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., 
epinephrine, antihistamines and corticosteroids, should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction during administration.
Cardiovascular  Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life-threatening cardiac 
arrhythmias. Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of RITUXAN. Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions including arrhythmias and angina have had recurrences of these events during RITUXAN therapy and should be monitored throughout the infusion and immediate post-infusion period.
Renal (See BOXED WARNINGS: Tumor Lysis Syndrome [TLS] and ADVERSE REACTIONS)  
RITUXAN administration has been associated with severe renal toxicity including acute renal 
failure requiring dialysis and in some cases, has led to a fatal outcome. Renal toxicity has occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (>25,000/mm
3) or high tumor burden 
who experience tumor lysis syndrome (see Tumor Lysis Syndrome) and in patients administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials. The combination of cisplatin and RITUXAN is not an approved treatment regimen. If this combination is used in clinical trials extreme caution  should 
be exercised; patients should be monitored closely for signs of renal failure. Discontinuation of RITUXAN should be considered for those with rising serum creatinine or oliguria. APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 67 of 83Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions (See BOXED WARNINGS)  Mucocutaneous reactions, some 
with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with RITUXAN. These reports include 
paraneoplastic pemphigus (an uncommon disorder which is a manifestation of the patient's underlying malignancy),
18 Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous 
dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The onset of the reaction in the reported cases has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following RITUXAN exposure. Patients experiencing a severe mucocutaneous reaction should not receive any further infusions and seek prompt medical evaluation. Skin biopsy may help to distinguish among different mucocutaneous reactions and guide subsequent treatment. The safety of readministration of RITUXAN to patients with any of these mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined.
Bowel Obstruction and Perforation  Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some 
cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL. In post-marketing reports, which include both patients with low-grade or follicular NHL and DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range 1–77) in patients with documented gastro-intestinal perforation. Complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.
PRECAUTIONS
Laboratory Monitoring
Because RITUXAN targets all CD20-positive B lymphocytes, malignant and nonmalignant, 
complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet counts should be obtained at regular intervals during RITUXAN therapy and more frequently in patients who develop cytopenias (see ADVERSE 
REACTIONS). The duration of cytopenias caused by RITUXAN can extend well beyond the 
treatment period. 
Drug/Laboratory InteractionsThere have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with RITUXAN. However, renal 
toxicity was seen with this drug in combination with cisplatin in clinical trials. (See WARNINGS, 
Renal.)
Immunization
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following RITUXAN therapy has not been studied. The ability to generate a primary or anamnestic humoral response to vaccination is currently being studied.

Page 68 of 83No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic or mutagenic 
potential of RITUXAN, or to determine its effects on fertility in males or females. Individuals of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for up to 12 months following RITUXAN therapy.
Pregnancy Category CAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with RITUXAN. It is not known whether 
RITUXAN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. Human IgG is known to pass the placental barrier, and thus may potentially cause fetal B-cell depletion; therefore, RITUXAN should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
Nursing MothersIt is not known whether RITUXAN is excreted in human milk. Because human IgG is excreted in 
human milk and the potential for absorption and immunosuppression in the infant is unknown, women should be advised to discontinue nursing until circulating drug levels are no longer detectable. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
Pediatric Use
The safety and effectiveness of RITUXAN in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseAmong patients with DLBCL in three randomized, active-controlled trials, 927 patients received 
RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy. Of these, 396 (43%) were age 65 or greater and 123 (13%) were age 75 or greater. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However, elderly patients were more likely to experience cardiac adverse events, mostly supraventricular arrhythmias. Serious pulmonary adverse events were also more common among the elderly, including pneumonia and pneumonitis.
Among the 331 patients with low-grade or follicular lymphoma enrolled in clinical studies of single 
agent RITUXAN, 24% were 65 to 75 years old and 5% were 75 years old and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.
ADVERSE REACTIONSBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates 
observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 69 of 83The overall safety database for RITUXAN is based on clinical trial data from 1283 patients with 
NHL, who received RITUXAN either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Additional safety information was obtained from post-marketing safety surveillance. The most common adverse reactions were infusion reactions (see INFUSION REACTIONS below).
The following serious adverse reactions, some with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients 
treated with RITUXAN (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS): severe or fatal infusion 
reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, severe mucocutaneous reactions, hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, other viral infections, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, renal toxicity, bowel obstruction and perforation.
Except as noted, adverse events described below occurred in the setting of relapsed or refractory, 
low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell, NHL and are based on 356 patients treated in nonrandomized, single-arm studies of RITUXAN administered as a single agent. Most patients received RITUXAN 375 mg/m
2 weekly for 4 doses.
Infusion Reactions (See BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS)
Mild to moderate infusion reactions consisting of fever and chills/rigors occurred in the majority of 
patients during the first RITUXAN infusion. Other frequent infusion reaction symptoms included nausea, pruritus, angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, throat irritation, rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, and hypertension. These reactions generally occurred within 30 to 120 minutes of beginning the first infusion, and resolved with slowing or interruption of the RITUXAN infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, IV saline, and vasopressors). The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion (77%) and decreased with each subsequent infusion (30% with fourth infusion and 14% with eighth infusion). Injection site pain was reported in less than 5% of patients.
Infectious Events (See WARNINGS: Hepatitis B Reactivation with Related Fulminant 
Hepatitis and Other Viral Infections)RITUXAN induced B-cell depletion in 70% to 80% of patients and was associated with decreased 
serum immunoglobulins in a minority of patients; the lymphopenia lasted a median of 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days). Infectious events occurred in 31% of patients: 19% of patients had bacterial infections, 10% had viral infections, 1% had fungal infections, and 6% were unknown infections. Incidence is not additive because a single patient may have had more than one type of infection. Serious infectious events (Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, occurred in 2% of patients.
Hematologic EventsGrade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated with RITUXAN; these include: 
lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%). The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days). A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following RITUXAN therapy were reported.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Page 70 of 83Pulmonary Events
135 patients (38%) experienced pulmonary events in clinical trials. The most common respiratory 
system adverse events experienced were increased cough, rhinitis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and sinusitis. In both clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance, there have been a limited number of reports of bronchiolitis obliterans presenting up to 6 months post-RITUXAN infusion and a limited number of reports of pneumonitis (including interstitial pneumonitis) presenting up to 3 months post-RITUXAN infusion, some of which resulted in fatal outcomes. The safety of resumption or continued administration of RITUXAN in patients with pneumonitis or bronchiolitis obliterans is unknown.
Immunogenicity
The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to RITUXAN with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.
In clinical studies of patients with low-grade or follicular NHL receiving single-agent RITUXAN, 
human antichimeric antibody (HACA) was detected in 4 of 356 (1.1%) patients and 3 had an objective clinical response. These data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to RITUXAN using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (limit of detection = 7 ng/mL).

Risk Factors Associated with Increased Rates of Adverse Events
Administration of RITUXAN weekly for 8 doses resulted in higher rates of Grade 3 and 4 adverse 
events14 overall (70%) compared with administration weekly for 4 doses (57%). The incidence of 
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar in patients retreated with RITUXAN compared with initial treatment (58% and 57%, respectively). The incidence of the following clinically significant adverse events was higher in patients with bulky disease (lesions > 10 cm) (N = 39) versus patients with 
lesions < 10 cm (N = 195): abdominal pain, anemia, dyspnea, hypotension, and neutropenia.
RITUXAN in Combination with Chemotherapy for DLBCLExcept as noted, adverse events described in the setting of DLBCL are based on three 
randomized, active-controlled clinical trials in which 927 patients received RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy and 802 received chemotherapy alone. Detailed safety data collection was primarily limited to Grade 3 and 4 adverse events and serious adverse events.
The population varied from 18 to 92 years of age and 55% were male; racial distribution was 
collected only for Study 1 (see CLINICAL STUDIES section) where 90% of patients were 
Caucasian, 5% were African American, 3% were Hispanic and 2% were from other racial groups. Patients received 4–8 doses of RITUXAN at 375 mg/m
2.
The following adverse events, regardless of severity, were reported more frequently (>5%) in 
patients age >60 years receiving R-CHOP as compared to CHOP alone: cardiac disorder (29% vs. 
21%), pyrexia (56% vs. 46%), chills (13% vs. 4%) and lung disorder (31% vs. 24%). In one of these 
studies (Study 2), more detailed assessment of cardiac toxicity revealed that supraventricular arrhythmias or tachycardia accounted for most of the difference in cardiac disorders, with 4.5% vs. 1.0% incidences for R-CHOP and CHOP, respectively.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Post-Marketing ReportsThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of RITUXAN. 
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to RITUXAN.

chemotherapy for up to 8 infusions.
RITUXAN as a Component of Zevalin™ (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan) Therapeutic Regimen
As a required component of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen, RITUXAN 250 mg/m2 should be 
infused within 4 hours prior to the administration of Indium-111- (In-111-) Zevalin and within 4 hours prior to the administration of Yttrium90- (Y-90-) Zevalin. Administration of RITUXAN and In-111-Zevalin should precede RITUXAN and Y-90-Zevalin by 7–9 days. Refer to the Zevalin package insert for full prescribing information regarding the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. RITUXAN may be administered in an outpatient setting. DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS 
PUSH OR BOLUS. (See Administration.)
Instructions for Administration
Preparation for Administration. Use appropriate aseptic technique. Withdraw the necessary 
amount of RITUXAN and dilute to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mg/mL into an infusion bag containing either 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP, or 5% Dextrose in Water, USP. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
RITUXAN solutions for infusion may be stored at 2-8°C (36-46°F) for 24 hours. RITUXAN solutions 
for infusion have been shown to be stable for an additional 24 hours at room temperature. However, since RITUXAN solutions do not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be stored refrigerated (2-8°C). No incompatibilities between RITUXAN and polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags have been observed. 
Administration: DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS
Infusion and hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, and 
ADVERSE REACTIONS). Premedication consisting of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine 
should be considered before each infusion of RITUXAN. Premedication may attenuate infusion reactions. Since transient hypotension may occur during RITUXAN infusion, consideration should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications 12 hours prior to RITUXAN infusion.
First Infusion. The RITUXAN solution for infusion should be administered intravenously at an initial 
rate of 50 mg/hr. RITUXAN should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs. If hypersensitivity or infusion reactions do not occur, escalate the infusion rate in 50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. If a hypersensitivity (non-IgE-mediated) or an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted (see BOXED WARNINGS and 
WARNINGS). The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of patient 
symptoms.
Subsequent Infusions. If the patient tolerated the first infusion well, subsequent RITUXAN infusions 
can be administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr, and increased by 100 mg/hr increments at 30-minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr as tolerated. If the patient did not tolerate the first infusion well, follow the guidelines under First Infusion.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Criteria for Evaluation of Response
1. Response Classifications
After study entry, disease activity evaluations will be made and recorded by using the following criteria and designated codes:A.     Complete Response (CR): During observation no disease is apparent, including measurable and non-measurable disease, and no 
evidence of disease is observed for at least 28 days, as confirmed by a second assessment following the original observation of  no disease.  
All nodes visualized on imaging studies or palpable on exams must have regressed to normal size ( ≤1.5 cm in their greatest transverse 
diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse di ameter before 
treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1 cm in their greatest transverse diameter after treatment, or by more than 75% in the sum of the 
products of the greatest diameters (SPD). (A
1)  = The patient must also be free from symptoms related to lymphoma, if present before 
therapy with no worsening in performance status from baseline. (A2) = Bone marrow, if initially positive at baseline, must be histologically 
negative for lymphoma and the liver and spleen, if enlarged due to lymphoma at baseline, should be normalized.  
In addition, gallium-avid-disease or PET-positive at baseline that converts to negative will be accepted as confirmation of res ponse, 
regardless of nodal size.
B. Partial Response (PR): A 50% or greater decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diamet ers 
of all the measured lesions is noted for at least 28 days as confirmed by a second assessment following the observation of the > or = to 50% 
decrease.  Additionally, no appearance of new lesions is noted.
C. CR/Unconfirmed (CRu): Includes those patients who fulfill criteria (A1) and (A2) see above, but with one or more of the following 
features:
1. A residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter then that has regressed by more than 75% in th e SPD. 
Individual nodes that were previously confluent must have regressed by more than 75% in their SPD compared with the size of the  
original mass.
2. Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number or size of aggregates without cytologic or architectural atypia).D. Stable Disease (SD): Patients have stable disease if they neither exhibit at least a 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the 
longest perpendicular diameters of all the measured lesions, nor exhibit at least a 50% increase in the sum of the products of the longest 
perpendicular diameters of all the measured lesions.  In addition no new lesions may have appeared.

Page 79 of 83E. Progressive Disease (PD): Progressive disease will be assessed with reference to baseline values for measurable lesions unles s a 
decrease in size has been observed, in which case progression will be measured from the nadir of the sum of the products of the  longest 
perpendicular diameters of all measured lesions.
Any single observation of a >25% increase in the sum of the sizes of all sentinel lesions, a 50% or greater increase in the siz e of any 
single lesion or the appearance of a new lesion constitutes progressive disease.  A statement by the investigator indicating th at clinical 
progressive disease has occurred may be used to signify progressive disease, as well as any death for which disease has occurre d must 
include the date of disease progression and confirmatory documentation, i.e. of non-sentinel lesions or non-measurable disease,  etc.

2. Measures of Duration
A. Response Interval: measured from the date when the response is first noted until the last date at which the measurements sati sfy 
the requirements for a partial or complete response.  An ongoing response is defined as a responder for whom no end of response  
can be determined.  In this case, the duration of response is considered as the last date when there is evidence of a continuin g 
response.
B. Progressive Disease (PD)-Free Interval: measured from the date when a CR or PR is first noted to the first date at which 
progressive disease is observed.  An ongoing PD-Free Interval occurs when there is a responder for whom progressive disease has  
not yet been noted.
C. Time to Progression: measured from the date of first study treatment to the first date when progressive disease is documented .
D. Survival:  duration of survival will be dated from the first day of treatment.
3. Sentinel Lesions

Page 80 of 83A minimum of one and maximum of six sentinel lesions will be selected for determining the efficacy of study treatment.  All sen tinel lesions 
must be measured at baseline by the method, which will be used, for routine tumor measurements during the study.  Sentinel lesi ons are 
defined as those lesions existing at baseline that most clearly represent the state of disease in the clinical judgment of the investigator, and 
need to be measurable bi dimensionally.  Sentinel lesions need to be at least 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm in size selected before treatment  begins, and 
should not be in previously irradiated fields (unless progression has occurred). The liver (span) itself cannot be used as a se ntinel lesion, 
although lesions within the liver are acceptable.  The minimum acceptable size of the sentinel lesions will depend on the numbe r and 
dimension as outlined in the following table:
Number of Lesions Dimensions Minimum Size
≥1 Bi-dimensional 1.0 x 1.0 cm
4. Definition of Measurable Disease
The extent of disease is measurable if the patient has one or more lesions that are clearly demarcated and may be represented w ith clearly 
defined margins as measured in centimeters.  These measurements will be bi-dimensional (two perpendicular measures per lesion).   Skin 
lesions must be documented by medical photography.  
5. Measurement of Sentinel Lesions:
All sentinel lesions must be measured at baseline by the method that will be used for routine tumor measurements during the stu dy.  Each 
sentinel lesion will be consistently measured bi-dimensionally for the duration of the study.  In addition, the routine method of measurement 
for any sentinel lesions, e.g., X-ray, PET scan, CT scan, etc., should remain the same for each evaluation throughout the study .  All 
measurements should be recorded in metric units, using a ruler or calipers.
A. Bi-dimensional Disease: measured by two perpendicular measurements of the lesion.  The first measurement is the longest span of 
the lesion, and the other measurement is the longest measurement perpendicular to the first measurement.  The size of the lesio n is 
the product of these two measurements.
B. Overall Size of Sentinel Lesions: the sum of the products of the two dimensions of each bi dimensional lesion(s).C. Uni dimensional sites of disease may be used only in addition to bi dimensionally measured disease >1.0 x 1.0 cm.  Record the  
single dimension as measured by ruler or caliper.

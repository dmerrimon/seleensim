Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Study Design:   This is a two -part study. 
Part 1 
Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study 
in hospitalized subjects with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 who require 
supplemental oxygen. 
Up to three ascending -dose cohorts, each comprised of 8 subjects, will be dosed at  
 total daily dose of TD -0903 or matched placebo . Six subjects in each 
cohort will b e randomized to receive TD-0903 and 2 subjects in each cohort will be 
randomized to receive placebo (3:1 randomization). Each dose level cohort will be 
initiated once the corresponding healthy volunteer cohort in Study TD -0903-0183 has 
completed dosing and the Dose Level Review Committee (DLRC) has recommended escalation.   Dosing will be either once or twice a day in divided doses, as informed by emerging data from Study TD -0903-0183 and prior cohorts in this study.   
Eligible subjects will be  randomized and dosed for up to 7 days or until discharge from 
the hospital, whichever is earlier . At the end of dosing for all subjects in each coh ort, the 
DLRC will review unblinded data through Day 7 and results from the same dose level 
cohort in Study TD-0903-0183 to inform progression to the next dose level and/ or to 
initiate Part 2 of the study. The blinding of subjects’ treatment assignments will be maintained for Theravance personnel  who are directly involved with the ongoing 
operational activities of the study, for all subjects, and for all site personnel until the study 
is concluded. The activities and composition of DL RC will be described in a charter.  
The DLRC will recommend the f inal dose to carry forward into Part 2, including the 
potential to dose twice daily . 
Part 1 will assess safety , tolerability , and PK of TD -0903.  Serial b lood samples will be 
collected from all subjects for PK assessments.  Oxygenation data will be collected for all 
subjects, and the ratio of peripheral oxygen saturation to the fraction of inspired oxygen 
(SaO2/FiO2 ratio ) will be measured to guide dose selection for Part 2.  
Subject follow -up after the dosing period will con tinue until Day 28.  
Part 2 
Part 2 is a randomized, double- blind, parallel -group study evaluating efficacy and safety 
of one dose of TD -0903 (selected based on the data from Part 1) as compared with 
placebo in hospitalized subjects with confirmed symptomat ic COVID-19 who require 
supplemental oxygen.   
   
 
 
 
 The
 study drug will be 
administered once-daily or twice daily in divided doses (as determined by results from 
Study TD -0903-0183 and from Part 1 of this study) for up to 7  days or until discharge 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 6 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  from the hospital, whichever is earlier. Subjects will be followed for up to 28 days or until 
death, whichever is earlier . 
Sparse sampling for assessment of TD -0903 plasma concentrations will be collected for 
population PK analysis. 
Parts 1 and 2  
Subjects will provide informed consent upon study entry; consent can be provided by the 
subject or legally  authorized representative, or as assent /proxy consent via both a clinician 
and second health professional attesting that the subject understands the risks and 
potential benefits and elects to proceed. Baseline assessments (Day  1) will include 
medical and medication history, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate  
[BP, HR, RR], and body tempe rature), a physical examination (including height and 
weight, and hepato- or splenom egaly at a minimum), and measures of oxygenation (pulse 
oximetry, FiO2).  Female subjects of childbearing potential will undergo a serum  
pregnancy test.  Blood samples will be collected from all subjects for hematology 
(complete blood count [CBC] with differential at a minimum), and serum chemistry 
(renal function, liver function tests , and triglycerides at a minimum).  The investigator 
will also evaluate the subject’s clinical status and review inclusion exclusion criteria.   
Oxygenation will be assessed via SaO2/FiO2 ratio.  Use of ventilatory  and oxygen 
support, presence in the ICU, clinical status (including mortality), and date of discharge 
will be recorded for all subjects as appropriate.   
Clinical status  will be assessed using an 8- point scale for all subjects.    
Changes in swab SARS -CoV-2 viral infection status , SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, 
blood cytokine levels, and biomarkers of inflammation, thrombosis and lung injury will 
be explored. 
Subject safety will be assessed throughout the study using standard measures, including 
adverse event  (AE) monitoring, physical examinations  (including hepato- or 
splenomegaly at a minimum) , vital signs (at a minimum, temperature, BP, HR  and 
respiratory rate [RR] ), clinical laboratory tests (at a minimum, CBC with differential, 
renal function [creatinine, blood urea nitrogen], and liver function tests [aspartate aminotransferase {AST}, alanine aminotransferase {ALT}, alkaline phosphatase {Alk Phos}, and total  bilirubin {TBili}]), and concomitant medication usage.  A Safety 
Assessment Committee will meet regularly to review safety data.   
Duration of Study Participation:   28 days or until death , whichever is  earlier.

1.4. Risks and Benefits  
There is a high unmet need for COVID-19 patients with ALI  as there are no approved 
treatments for COVID -19.  Given the high potency of TD-0903 in inhibiting cytokine 
activation  in human cells , and its formulation as an inhaled agent, TD -0903 may be a 
potentially effective treatment of inflammatory lung diseases.    
Nonclinical safety studies did not reveal any adverse safety findings

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  2. OBJECTIVES  
The objectives are based on a subject population hospitalized with confirmed symptomatic  
COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen. 
Part 1: 
The objectives are:  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of inhaled TD -0903 in subjects with 
COVID-19 
• Assess the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of TD -0903 in subjects with 
COVID-19 
• Characterize the effect of TD -0903 on reducing the acute lung injury (as 
measured by SaO2/FiO2 ratio) associated with COVID -19 
• Explore the effect  of TD-0903 on swab viral infection status , SARS-CoV-2 
antibody levels , blood cytokine levels and biomarkers of inflammation, 
thrombosis and lung injury. 
Part 2:  
The primary objective is to characterize the efficacy of TD -0903 as measured by respiratory 
failure-free days (R FDs) through Day 28. 
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of TD -0903 on: 
• Reducing the acute lung injury (as measured by SaO2/FiO2 ratio) associated with 
COVID-19  
• Safety and tolerability  
• Clinical outcomes as measured by an 8- point clinical status scale   
• The proportion of subjects alive and respiratory failure -free on Day 28

3.1. Overview  
This is a two -part study.   
3.1.1. Part 1:  Multiple Ascending Dosing  
Part 1 is a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, multiple ascending dose study in 
hospitalized subjects with confirmed symptomatic  COVID-19 who require supplemental 
oxygen. 
Up to three ascending -dose cohorts, each comprised of 8 subjects, will be dosed at  
total daily dose of TD-0903 or matched placebo . Six subjects in each cohort 
will be randomized to receive TD -0903 and 2 subjects in each coh ort will be randomized to 
receive placebo (3:1 randomization). Each dose level cohort will be initiated once the 
corresponding healthy volunteer cohort in Study TD-0903-0183 has completed dosing and 
the Dose Level Review Committee (DLRC) has recommended escalation.   Dosing will be either once or twice a day in divided doses, as informed by emerging data from Study TD-0903-0183 and any prior cohorts in this study.   
Eligible subjects will be randomized and dosed for up to 7 days or until discharge from the hospital, whichever is earlier. At the end of dosing for all subjects in each cohort, the DLRC 
will review unblinded data through Day 7, and results from the same dose level cohort in Study TD-0903-0183 to inform progression to the next dose level and/ or to initiate Part 2 of 
the study. The blinding of subjects’ treatment assignments will be maintained for Theravance personnel who are directly involved with the ongoing operational activities of the study, for all subjects, and for all site personnel until the study is concluded. The activities and composition of DLRC will be described in a charter. 
The DLRC will recommend the final dose to carry forward into Part 2, including the 
potential to dose twice daily.  
Part 1 will assess safety, tolerability, and PK of TD-0903.  Serial blood samples will be 
collected from all subjects for PK assessments.  Oxygenation data will be collected for all subjects, and the ratio of peripheral oxygen saturation to the fraction of inspired oxygen 
(SaO2/FiO2 ratio ) will be measured to guide dose selection for Part 2.  
Subject follow-up after the dosing period will continue until Day 28.   
3.1.2. Part 2:  Parallel Group  
Part 2 is a randomized, double- blind, parallel -group study evaluating efficacy and safety of 
one dose of TD -0903 (selected based on the data from Part 1)  as compared with placebo in 
hospitalized subjects with confirmed symptomatic  COVID-19 who require supplemental 
oxygen.  Approximately 99 subjects per group (19 8 subjects total)  will be enrolled in Part 2.  
 
 
 
 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 33 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  (Table 3). The study drug will be administered once -daily or twice daily in divided doses 
(as determined by results from Study TD-0903-0183 and from Part 1 of this study) for up to 
7 days or until discharge from  the hospital, whichever is earlier. Subjects will be followed for 
up to 28 days or until death, whichever is earlier.  
Sparse sampling for assessment of TD -0903 plasma concentrations may  be collected for 
population PK analysis. 
3.1.3. Parts 1 and 2  
Subjects will provide informed consent upon study entry; consent can be provided only by 
the subject  or legally authorized representative  outside the United Kingdom (U.K.), or, 
within the U.K. , as assent/proxy consent via both a clinician and second health professional 
attesting that the subject understands the risks and potential benefits and elects to proceed. 
Baseline assessments (Day1) will include medical and medication history, vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate , respiratory rate  [BP, HR, RR], and body temperature ), a physical 
examination (including height and weight, and hepato- or splenomegaly at a minimum), and 
measures of oxygenation (pulse oximetry, FiO2).  Female subjects of childbearing potential 
will undergo a serum pregnancy test.  Blood samples will be collected from all subjects for 
hematology (complete blood count [C BC] with differential at a minimum), and serum 
chemistry (renal function, liver function tests, and triglycerides at a minimum).  The 
investigator will also evaluate the subject’s clinical status and review inclusion /exclusion 
criteria.   
Oxygenation will be assessed via SaO2/FiO2 ratio.  Use of ventilatory  and oxygen support, 
presence in the ICU, clinical status (including mortality), and date of discharge will be 
recorded for all subjects as appropriate.   
Clinical status will be assessed using an 8- point scale for all subjects.  
Changes in swab SARS -CoV-2 viral infection status , SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, blood 
cytokine levels, and biomarkers  of inflammation, thrombosis, and lung injury will be 
explored. 
Subject safety will be assessed throughout the study using standard measures, including 
adverse event (AE) monitoring, physical examinations (i ncluding hepato- or splenomegaly at 
a minimum) , vital signs (at a minimum, temperature, BP, HR , and respiratory rate [RR] ), 
clinical laboratory tests (at a minimum, CBC with differential, renal function [creatinine, 
blood urea nitrogen], and liver function tests [aspartate aminotransferase {AST}, alanine aminotransferase {ALT}, alkaline phosphatase {Alk Phos}, and total bilirubin {TBili}]) , and 
concomitant medication usage.  A Safety Assessment Committee will meet regularly to review safety data.

3.5. Minimization of Bias  
3.5.1. Blinding 
Part 1 and Part 2 of this study will be conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  
Part 1 will be  unblinded  to the DLRC after 7-day dosing is completed for all subjects in  each 
cohort. 
3.5.1.1. Part 1 
For Part 1, randomization and treatment assignment will be via the Randomization Trial 
Supply Management System (RTSM). 
Subjects will be assigned in random order to TD-0903 or placebo according to the 
randomization schedule. All study subjects, study investigators and their staff, and the 
Sponsor’s staff involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to treatment assignment Unblinded study staff will include dose adminis tration staff at the research site and the site 
pharmacist and/or designee[s], neither of whom will be involved in direct subject care, or 
collection  or analysis of data.  Following the final Day 7 dosing of all subjects in each cohort, 
the DLRC (as described in Section  6.4) will review the data in an unblinded manner; any 
data reviewed by Sponsor personnel before that point will be performed in a blinded manner.  
Additionally, to facilitate PK analysis, the analyst at the PK bioanalytical lab may be 
unblinded, however, any PK data provided to the Sponsor for analysis will be provided in a 
blinded fashion (i.e., PK data cannot be linked to an individual subject).   
Breaking of the blind is expressly forbidden except in the event of a medical emergency 
where the identity of the drug must be known in order to properly treat the subject.  If 
breaking the blind is required because of a medical emergency, the treatment identity will be 
revealed by the investigator or designee for that subject only. In the event that the emergency 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 37 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  is one in which it appears that the other subjects may be at imminent risk, the blind may be 
broken for all subjects dosed at that dose level. The unblinding will be properly documented 
in the study file and captured in the RTSM . The responsibility to break the blind resides 
solely with the investigator (or designee), however, it is requested that the i nvestigator or 
designee will make every effort to contact the Medical Monitor or designee to notify him/her 
of the medical emergency and the breaking of the blind as soon as it is practicable, granting 
that these efforts should not stall or delay the unblinding of trial subject t reatment in 
emergency situations.  
In the absence of a medical emergency, the blinded randomization for this study will not be 
revealed to any blinded person until all data are entered in the database, edits checks are performed, queries closed, electronic  case report form s (eCRFs) signed by the investigator(s) 
or designee, and the database is officially locked. 
 
3.5.1.2. Part 2 
For Part 2, randomization and treatment assignment will be via the Randomization Trial Supply Management S ystem. 
In the event of an untoward safety observation, the investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment using the RTSM . The blind should be broken only if knowledge of the 
subject’s study medication would affect subsequent treatment and such knowledge is 
required for the clinical management of the subject. Any investigator unblinding will be 
documented within the appropriate section of the subject’s case report from (CRF) and will, for Part 2,  be captured in the RTSM.  
Unblinding of individual study s ubjects or study center staff on the basis of results from the 
study procedures (i.e., self-unblinding) is considered to be improbable. 
3.5.2. Treatment Assignment  
3.5.2.1. Part 1 
Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized 3:1, TD-0903 to  placebo. 
3.5.2.2. Part 2

6.3. Description of Study Assessments  
6.3.1. Demographic and Baseline Assessments  
Subjects will provide informed consent (or assent /proxy consent as per local site procedures  
via both a clinician and second health professional) upon admission to the hospital.  Each subject will be asked to provide a relevant medical history (with the aid of medical records if available) including review of COVID-19 symptoms that lead to hospital administration, 
medication history, concomitant medications, known immunosuppression and source of 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  immunosuppression (i.e., disease or medication) and demographic information including year  
of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity.  The subject will also undergo a physical examination 
including vital signs ( BP, HR, RR, and body temperature)  and height and weight , presence of 
hepato- or splenomegaly, and will also  have the following assessments measured:  pulse 
oximetry, FiO2, modified Borg Dyspnea Score and clinical status.  Female subjects of childbearing potential will have blood  collected for a  serum pregnancy test.  Blood will be 
collected for serial PK assessments (for subjects enrolled in Part 1), CBC with differential, 
and serum chemistry including renal function, liver function tests , triglycerides , ferritin, and 
fibrinogen. 
6.3.2. Efficacy Assessments  
Subjects will be evaluated for peripheral oxygen saturation on Day 1 through Day 7.  Pulse 
oximetry will be measured 3 times  over 5 minutes and the average value recorded . Data will 
be used to calculate SaO2/FiO2 ratio.  
The Modified Borg Dyspnea Score is based on  a 10-point scale that measures shortness of 
breath.  Scores range from 0 (nothing at all, no shortness of breath) to 10 (maximal shortness 
of breath).
30  Subjects will record their  resting modified Borg Dyspnea Score  on Day 1 
through Day 7. 
Clinical outcomes will be assessed as follows:  
• Use of ventilatory and oxygen support 
• ICU days 
• For Part 1, clinical status assessed by the investigator on Day 1 through Day 7 
inclusive, on Day 14, Day 21, prior to hospital discharge, and on Day 28, based 
on an 8-point scale as summarized in Table 3 
• For Part 2, c linical status assessed by the investigator daily on Day 1 through Day 
28 inclusive, during hospitalization  and at hospital discharge, based on a n 8-point 
scale as summarized in Table 3.  If subjects are discharged from the hospital  
before Days 14, 21 or 28 and are known to be alive at discharge, they will 
undergo a telephonic study visit on Days 14, 21, and/or 28 to provide data relating 
to clinical status .

6.3.5. Safety Assessments  
6.3.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reviewed and recorded beginning at Day 0 or Day 1 (i.e., after signing 
the Informed Consent Form [ICF] or providing assent /proxy consent as per local site 
procedures up to and including Day 21, and prior to discharge from the hospital.  Adverse 
events will also be reviewed and recorded at the follow-up contact at Day 28.  For subjects 
who discontinue due to a nonserious AE, follow-up information on these events will be 
collected at Day 28.  For subjects who discontinue due to a serious AE, follow-up 
information will be obtained as described in Section  7.3.3.   
Adverse events may be observed by the study center personnel or spontaneously reported by 
the subject. Subjects will be reminded to call the study center to report AEs that occur 
between discharge from the hospital, and the Day 28 follow-up contact.   
6.3.5.2. Medical History  
To the extent possible, medical history on Day 1 will include evaluation for past and present 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurological, endocr ine, 
lymphatic, hematologic, immunologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, genitourinary, substance abuse, surgical history, or any other diseases or disorders, including known immunosuppression and source of immunosuppression (i.e., disease or medication) .   
6.3.5.3. Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will include an assessment of hepato- or splenomegaly  in order to 
obtain the  subjects modified HScore ( Table 4). To the extent possible, physical examinations 
at enrollment on Day 1 will include height and weight, and examination of the following:  
general appearance; head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck, skin, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, abdominal system, lymphatic system, dermatologic system, musculoskeletal system, and nervous system.  
Physical examinations on subsequent days will assess changes since the previous examination, which may be recorded as AEs, if appropriate.

6.3.5.4.1. Part 1 
Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, and body temperature) will be collected on Day 1 through Day 7 
prior to the subject’s first dose, prior to hospital discharge ( first vital signs of the morning), 
and Day 28 (for subjects still hospitalized; first vital signs of the morning).  All 
measurements will be taken after the subject has been resting in a semirecumbent position for 
approximately 5 minutes. 
On Day 14 and Day 21, this information will be collected via a review of the subject’s chart.  
6.3.5.4.2. Part 2 
Vital signs ( BP, HR, RR, and body temperature) will be collected on Day 1 through Day 7, 
Day 14, Day 21, prior to hospital discharge , and Day 28 (for subjects still hospitalized).  
Measurements will be taken after the subject has been resting in a semirecumbent position 
for approximately 5 minutes. 
6.3.5.5. Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples for routine clinical laboratory evaluation will be collected on Day 1  and 
Day 7.  At all other times,  this information will be recorded if these tests were performed for 
clinical purposes.  
6.3.5.5.1. Hematology  
Hematology assessments will include, at a minimum, a CBC with differential.   
6.3.5.5.2. Serum Chemistry  
Serum chemistry assessments will include, at a minimum, renal function (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen), liver function tests (AST, ALT, Alk Phos, and TB ili), triglycerides, ferritin, 
and fibrinogen. 
Additional blood samples may be collected to explore PD  effects by evaluating the 
biomarkers described in Section  6.3.4. 
6.3.5.5.3. Serum Pregnancy Test  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test performed on 
Day 1.  If the result is positive, the subject will not be enrolled into the stud y. 
6.4. Dose Escalation Stopping Rules (Part 1 Only)  
A decision to proceed to the next higher dose administration or initiate Part 2  will be made 
by the site investigator(s) and the DLRC. The DLRC will include the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor, Study Director, Clinical Pharmacologist, and an independent statistician; other 
representatives may be considered on a case -by-case basis if additional expertise is required.   
All pertinent safety/tolerability data (e.g., physical examinations, vital signs assessments, clinical laboratory tests, and AEs) and pharmacodynamic data ( e.g., SaO2/FiO2 ratio) 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020

to a level higher than planned will not occur without a protocol amendment. Part 2 of the study will be initiated following the recommendation of the DLRC. The 
decision to initiate Part 2 will be based on evidence of predictable PK response, acceptable 
safety profile, an d evidence of improved oxygenation at a dose lower than   
 
 
6.5. Concomitant Medications  
 
   
All
 concomitant medications, including name of medication, date started and stopped, route 
of administration, indication, and dose will be recorded in the source documentation and on the CRF. The Sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter) of any 
administration of a prohibited medication. Administration of a prohib ited medication may 
result in the subject being discontinued from the study.

6.6. Restrictions 
Restrictions regarding subject care will be based on hospital standards and the subject’s 
clinical course during the study.   
6.6.1. Females of Childbearing Potential 
Females of childbearing potential must have documentation of a negative serum pregnancy 
test prior to randomization on Day 1.  
To be considered a female of non -childbearing potential, the subject must have undergone 
one of the following sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to dosing: 
• bilateral salpingectomy; 
• hysterectomy; 
• bilateral oophorectomy. 
A female subject  will also be considered to be of non-childbearing potential if the subject is 
postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 12 months prior to dosing without an alternative 
medical cause. FSH levels will be measured only in cases when postmenopausal status is in question. 
6.6.2. Contraception Measures for Male and Female Subjects  
All female subjects of childbearing potential and male subject s with partners of childbearing 
potential must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control during the study and for 
at least 30 days after the last  dose of study drug to prevent conception. A highly effective 
method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e.,  < 1% per year) 
when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include:
 
• combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
− oral 
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: − oral 
− injectable  
− implantable  
• intrauterine device  

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 61 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  • intrauterine hormone- releasing system  
• bilateral tubal occlusion  
• vasectomi zed male partner  
Vasectomi zed partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential trial 
participant and that the vasectomi zed partner has documented medical assessment 
of the surgical success. 
• sexual abstinence  
True abstinence is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse in line with 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for 
the duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception. 
Birth control methods which may not be considered highly ef fective are as follows:  
• progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action 
• male or female condom with or without spermicide 
• cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide 
Male subjects must agree to use condoms to prevent potential fetal or partner exposure 
through seminal fluid, in addition to the use of highly effective pregnancy prevention 
measures during the study and through 30 days after the last dose of study medication. 
6.7. Discontinuation  
6.7.1. Subject Dis continuation  
 
 
 
Any subj
ect may withdraw their consent to participate in the study at any time without 
prejudice. The investigator must withdraw from the study any subject who requests to be withdrawn. Subjects will be asked if they can be contacted  at Day 28; if they do not consent 
to this contact, tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit should be performed at the 
time of withdrawal.  
A subject’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator and in accordance with his or her clinical judgment. When possible, the tests and 
evaluations listed for the termination visit should be carried out. If a subject withdraws before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal is to be documented on the CRF. 
The Sponsor will be notified of all subject withdrawals.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Reasons for which the investigator or the Sponsor may withdraw a subject from the study or 
a subject may choose to terminate participation before completion of the study include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
• Adverse event 
• Subject choice 
• Major violation of the protocol 
− Did not receive a dose on at least 4 days of the treatment period  
− Received a prohibited concomitant medication 
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor 
• Other 
If a subject is discharged prio r to Day 28 and there are 3 documented, unsuccessful attempts 
to reach the subject by telephone at any time between Day 25 and Day 35 (during Part 1), or 
Days 14, 21, and/or 28 (± 3 days; during Part 2), the subject will be considered lost to follow -
up. 
6.7.2. Subject Replacement  
 
 
6.7.3. Study Discontinuation  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue this study at any time for any reason.   
6.8. Pregnancy 
Given the inpatient setting and the disease being studied, pregnancies during the study are 
not anticipated . 
However, if a female subject or a female partner of a subject  discovers she is pregnant  within 
30 days of dosing, the Sponsor clinical study director (or designee) must be notified immediately. Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any 
postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required. 
Subjects must agree to not donate ova or sperm through 30 da ys after receiving the last dose 
of study medication (Section 4.2 ).

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  7. ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1. Definitions  
The definitions below are based on International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
guideline E2A, “Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting”. 
7.1.1. Adverse Events (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship w ith 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.  
• AEs may be new events 
• Preexisting events that increase in frequency, severity or change in nature or seriousness during or as a consequence of participation in clinical studies.  
• Pre- or post-treatment complications that occur as a result of a protocol-mandated 
procedure (such as a biopsy). 
• AEs may be clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory tests, or other diagnostic investigation (e.g., laboratory results, x-ray 
findings). 
• AEs may result from an overdose of the study medication.  
Whenever possible, the diagnosis (rather than a series of terms related to a diagnosis) should be recorded as the AE term.  
An AE does not include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE . 
• Preexisting diseases or conditions present or detected before signing an ICF that 
do not worsen 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (such as 
hospitalization for ele ctive surgery or social and/or convenience admissions) 
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or 
symptoms, unless the subject is hospitalized for observation  
Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date 
prior to the time the subject signed the ICF is considered to be preexisting and should be 
documented in the medical history CRF. 
Pregnancy is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct 
of the study, Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (TBPH) will be notified according to the 
procedures for SAE reporting as outlined in Section  7.3.3.  Follow-up information regarding 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 65 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  the outcome of the pregnancy and any fetal or neonatal sequelae will be obtained and 
documented. 
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence occurring at 
any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening situation.   “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• New Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
– Note: New inpatient hospitalization refers to a subsequent hospitalization 
after the subject’s current hospitalization for COVID-19. To meet this 
criteria the subject must be formally admitted to a hospital for medical 
reasons for any length of time; it may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department nor does it 
include preplanned hospitalizations. Complications that occur d uring 
hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization, it is 
an SAE. 
• Disability - a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study 
drug 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately 
life-threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
7.1.3. Additional Considerations for Serious Adverse Events 
• Death is an outcome of an AE  and not an AE  in itself. Deaths of unknown cause 
for which the investigator cannot identify a cause of death will be captured as death of unknown cause or death not otherwise specified. 
• All deaths, regardless of cause, must be reported for subjects if the death occurs while the subject is participating in the s tudy. 
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at 
the time of the event; dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or 
interrupted temporarily before the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event.  

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 66 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  7.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed by the investigator and recorded in the CRF, including the dates of 
onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, and action taken with 
study medication. 
7.2.1. Severity 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe nausea).  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  The severity of AEs will be 
assessed according to the following definitions:   
• Mild:  the AE is noticeable to the patient and/or the investigator, but does not 
interfere with routine activity.  
• Moderate :  the AE interferes with routine activity, but responds to symptomatic 
therapy or rest.  
• Severe:  the AE significantly limits the patient’s ability to perform routine activities despite symptomatic therapy.  
7.2.2. Causal Relationship to Study Medication  
The investigator’s assessment of causality is based on clinical judgment regarding the 
reasonable possibility that the study medication caused the event and may inclu de 
consideration of some or all of the following factors: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, 
comorbid conditions, other drugs, and environmental factors. 
• The temporal association between drug exposure and onset of the AE.  
• Whether the clinical or laboratory manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the study medication. 
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping the 
study medication (“dechallenge”) or recurred or worsened upon re- exposure to the 
study medication (“rechallenge”).  
The causal relationship between the study medication and the AE  will be described using one 
of the following categories: 
• Not Related:  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study 
drug (such as a preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication). 
• Related: A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and 
administration of the study drug. It cannot be readily explained by the subject’s clinical state or concomitant therapies and appears with some degree of certainty 
to be related based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic actions of the 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 67 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  drug. In case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the event abates or resolves 
and reappears upon rechallenge. It should be emphasized that ineffective 
treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of AE 
reporting. 
7.3. AE Reporting and Recording 
7.3.1. AE Reporting  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical trials is crucial for the protection of patients and is mandated by regulatory agencies.  Sponsor has established SOPs in compliance with regulatory requirements worldwide to 
ensure appropriate reporting of safety information.  All clinical trials sponsored by TBPH will be conducted in accordance with these procedures.  
7.3.2. AE and SAE Recording  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or causal relationship to study medication, will 
be recorded from signing an ICF/providing assent through the last study visit (or last subject 
contact in the case of a follow -up telephone call).  AEs will be recorded on the AE page of 
the CRF.  SAEs, regardless of relationship to study medication will be recorded from signing 
an ICF/providing assent through the last study visit (or last subject contact in the case of a 
follow-up telephone call).   All SAEs will be recorded on both the SAE Report Form and the 
AE page of the CRF and should include the following:   
Description of event :   
• Signs and symptoms due to a common etiology should be reported as a single 
diagnosis; for example, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head 
congestion would be reported as “upper respiratory infection”.   
• A diagnosis or description must be as specific and as complete as possible 
(e.g., “lower extremity edema” instead of “edema”).  
• “Death” should not be used as an AE term unless th e cause of death is unknown.  
For events with a fatal outcome, the cause of death should be the AE term (e.g., if 
a subject died of an acute myocardial infarction, the AE  term should be recorded 
as “Myocardial Infarction” and the event outcome as fatal).     
Relationship to study medication: The investigator will assess the causal relationship of the 
study medication to the AE using the guidelines in Section 7.2.2.  
Severity: The severity of the AE will be assessed using the guidelines in Section  7.2.1. 
Outcome:  The outcome of AEs will be recorded.   
Therapeutic measures:  Measures taken for the treatment or management of the AEs will be 
recorded.

SAEs will be reported to Global Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee within 24 hours 
of the time the investigator or his/her designee becomes aware that an SAE has occurred, 
whether or not the event is considered to be related to study medication.  A written report signed by the investigator should be submitted within 24 hours.   
The SAE Report Form must be completed in accordance with the SAE Report Form 
Completion Guidelines.  If all information on the SAE Report Form is not available at the 
time of the initial report, follow -up SAE reports will be completed and submitted.   
To report an SAE, complete and fax or email the Serious Adverse Event Report Form to the 
following:

phone:  
Email:  
For fatal or life -threatening events, also fax copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, 
and other documents if available. Additional information may be requested from the 
investigator to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
An SAE may qualify for reporting to regulatory authorities if the SAE is possibly attributable 
to the study drug and is unexpected/unlisted based on the current TD -0903 IB. In this case, 
all investigators will receive notification of the event. The investigator is responsible for 
notifying the Institutional Review Board  (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee  (IEC) and 
documenting the notification, as required by local regulatory authorities and in accordance 
with the local institutional policy.  
7.4. Adverse Event Follow -up 
A subject experiencing an AE  will be followed by the investigator or his/her trained 
delegate(s) through the follow-up period until Day 28.   All SAEs will be followed until the 
investigator and/or the Sponsor has determined that the SAE has resolved or a stable clinical endpoint is reached, whichever is longer. The Sponsor may request follow-up of certain AEs  
until resolution and documentation of assessments made during this period. 
Any medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded in the concomitant 
medication section of the CRF .

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  9. STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
This study will be conducted in compliance with all applicable regulations. 
9.1. Principal Investigator Responsibili ties 
Before beginning the study, the principal investigator at each site must provide to the 
Sponsor or its designee a fully executed and signed Form FDA 1572 (or equivalent) and a 
financial disclosure form. For applicable studies, financial disclosure for ms must also be 
completed for all subinvestigators who will be directly involved in the treatment or 
evaluation of research subjects in this study. (A subinvestigator is defined in ICH E6 as any 
individual member of the clinical study team designated and supervised by the investigator at 
a study site to perform critical study -related procedures and/or to make important study-
related decisions [e.g., associates, residents, research fellows].)  
The principal investigator will ensure the following: 
• He or she will conduct the study in accordance with the relevant, current protocol and will only make changes in a protocol after notifying the Sponsor, except when 
necessary to protect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects.  
• He or she will personally conduct or supervise the study. 
• He or she will inform any potential subjects, or any persons used as controls, that the drugs are being used for investigational purposes and he or she will ensure 
that the requirements relating to obtaining informed consent in Code of Federal 
Regulations Title  21 (21 CFR) Part  50 and institutional review board (IRB) 
review and approval in 21 CFR Part  56 are met  and outside of the US, compliance 
with ICH E6 and/or local regulatory requirements is required . He or she will also  
ensure that site -specific requirements for obtaining  subject assent/  proxy consent 
(per the investigative site’s  procedures) are met. 
• He or she will report to the S ponsor adverse experiences that occur in the course 
of the investigation in accordance with 21 CFR 312.64 and outside of the US, 
compliance with ICH E6 and/or local regulatory requirements is required . 
• He or she has read and understands the information in the TD-0903 IB , including 
potential risks and side effects of the drug. 
• His or her staff an d all persons who assist in the conduct of the study are informed 
about their obligations in meeting the above commitments 
• He or she will ensure that  there are adequate and accurate records in accordance 
with 21 CFR 312.62 and w ill make those records avail able for inspection in 
accordance with 21  CFR 312.68 and outside of the US, compliance with ICH E6 
and/or local regulatory requirements is required . 
• He or she will ensure that the IRB/IEC complies with the with the local and 
international regulatory requir ements (for example in the US, compliance with 
21 CFR 56 is required and outside of the US, compliance with ICH E6 and/or local regulatory requirements is required), and other applicable regulations, and 
conducts initial and ongoing reviews and approvals of the study. He or she will 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 79 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  also ensure that any change in research activity and all problems involving risks 
to human subjects or others are reported to the IRB/IEC. Additionally, he or she 
will not make any changes in the research without IRB/IEC approva l, except 
where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects.  
• He or she agrees to comply with all other requirements regarding the obligations of clinical investigators and all other pertinent requirements in 21  CFR Part  312, 
and outside of the US, ICH E6 and/or local regulatory requirements . 
9.2. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before beginning study- specific research, the investigator will obtain written confirmation 
that the IRB, IEC, or Research Ethics Board (RE B) is properly constituted and compliant 
with ICH and Good Clinical Practice (GCP ) requirements, applicable laws, and local 
regulations. A copy of the confirmation from the IRB/IEC/REB will be provided to the 
Sponsor or its designee. The protocol, ICF, IB, and any other appropriate written information provided to the subjects that the I RB/IEC/REB may require to fulfill its responsibilities will 
be submitted to the IRB/IEC/REB in advance of the study. The Sponsor or its designee must approve the ICF and all subject recruitment materials before they are submitted to the IRB/IEC/REB. The st udy will not proceed until appropriate documents from the 
IRB/IEC/REB confirming unconditional approval of the protocol and the ICF are obtained by the investigator and copies are received by the Sponsor or its designee. If possible, the approval document should refer to the study by study protocol title and the Sponsor study 
number, identify the documents reviewed, and include the date of the review and approval. 
The written approval of the IRB/IEC/REB will be retained as part of the study file. The study may proceed before approval of consent forms and other study documents translated to a 
language other than the native language of the clinical site, provided that written 
IRB/IEC/REB approval of the translated documents is obtained before they are used. Any amendments to the protocol should be reviewed promptly. 
The investigator must provide the appropriate periodic reports on the progress of the study to 
the IRB/IEC/REB and the Sponsor in accordance with local IRB/IEC/REB requirements and applicable governmental regulations, whichever is strictest.  
9.3. Informed Consent 
A properly written and executed ICF, in compliance with- ICH E6 (GCP Guideline, 
Section 4.8), 21 CFR Part 50, and other applicable local regulations, will be obtained for 
each subject before enrol lment of the subject into the study. In the U.K, informed consent can 
be provided as proxy consent via a clinician and another health professional attesting that the 
subject understands the risks and potential benefits and elects to proceed.  Outside the U .K., 
written informed consent may only be obtained from the subject or legally authorized representative . 
The investigator will prepare the ICF or revise the template ICF and provide the documents 
to the Sponsor (or designee) for approval before submission to the IRB/IEC/REB. The 
Sponsor and the IRB/IEC/REB must approve the documents before they are implemented. 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 80 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  The investigator will provide copies of the signed ICF to each subject (or the subject’s LAR) 
and will maintain the original in the subject’s record file.  
9.4. Data Recording and Quality Assurance 
As used in this protocol, a C RF should be understood to refer to be an electronic data record.  
Electronic data capture technology will be used for this study. All clinical information 
requested in this protocol will be recorded on the eCRFs approved by the Sponsor, or via 
other data collection methods, e.g., electronic laboratory data transfer. Study site personnel 
will enter (in English) study data into the CRFs for each randomized subject. Training on the 
EDC application will be completed and documented before access to the EDC system is 
given. 
In the event of a CRF data change (e.g., correction of an error or addition of new 
information), corrections will be made to the CRF. Corrections to the CRFs, including the 
reason for change, will be automatically documented through the EDC system’s audit trail. 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing all CRFs, verifying them for accuracy, and 
approving them via an electronic signature. The investigator is designated as the signatory 
coordinating investigator. 
An electronic copy of the CRF casebooks will be sent to the site for retention with other 
study documents after full completion of the study, i.e., after database lock. 
The investigator is responsible for mainta ining accurate, authentic, complete, and up- to-date 
records for each subject. The investigator is also responsible for ensuring the availability of 
any original source documentation related to the study (including any films, tracings, 
computer discs, tapes , and worksheets). In most cases the source is the subject’s medical 
record. Data collected on the CRFs must match the source documents.  
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 
9.5. Document Retention 
Until otherwise notified by the Sponsor, an investigative site must retain in a controlled manner all study documents required by the Sponsor and by the applicable regulations. 
The investigative site must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation 
of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of 
study records (e.g., subject charts) and any original source documents that are electronic, as 
required by applicable regulations.  
The investigator must consult the Sponsor representative before disposal of any study records 
and must notify the Sponsor of any change in the location or disposition of the study files. 
If an investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of 
keeping the study documents, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the 
responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new 
custodian and must approve this transfer of responsibility. 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 81 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  9.6. Confidentiality  
The investigator or designee must explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that, for evaluation of study results, the subject’s confidential medical information obtained 
during the study may be shared with the study Sponsor, the study S ponsor’s affiliated 
companies, the study Sponsor’s designated service providers, regulatory agencies, and the 
IRB or IEC. The investigator (or designee) is responsible for obtaining written permission to 
use confidential medical information in accordance w ith country- specific regulations (such as 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the United  States) from each 
subject. If permission to use confidential medical information is withdrawn, the investigator is responsible for documenting t hat no further data from the subject will be collected.  
Subject medical information obtained during this study is confidential, and disclosure to 
unauthorized third parties is prohibited. The pertinent sections of data protection laws will be 
complied with  in full. Study records containing subject information will only be identified by 
the subject identification number, subject initials, date of birth, and study number, and not by 
the subject’s full name, except the subject consent form  or documentation of subject assent , 
which is archived at the study center only. The subject’s name will not be used in any public 
report of the study. 
During the course of the study, a confidential subject identification list will be maintained by 
the investigator and archive d at the investigative site.  
Before and during the conduct of the study, no study- related details may be disclosed, 
i.e., placed on the internet, published, or otherwise publicized, or provided to a third party without prior written permission from the Spo nsor. The policy for publication of data after 
completion of the study is described in Section  9.9 (Publication).  
9.7. Access to Data and Documents  
Upon receipt of the subject’s permission, medical information may be given to his or her personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for his or her welfare.  
Study data recorded on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data. All original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records generated by this study must be available to the Sponsor, representatives of the Sponsor, the IRB/IEC/REB, and applicable regulatory 
authorities, and they may be used for submission to regulatory authorities. In addition, all 
source data should be attributable (signed and dated), consistent with local medical practice. The investigator must therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects must 
also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will 
confirm their agreement when giving informed/proxy consent. 
9.8. Quality Control: Study Monitoring and Auditing 
Qualified individuals designated by the Sponsor will monitor all aspects of the study according to GCP and SOPs for compliance with applicable government regulations. The investigator agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the clinical data and supplies, 
dispensing, and storage areas and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The investigator 
and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by the Sponsor or its designees. 

Protocol 0188  18 September 2020  
TD-0903 Page 82 of 86 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Members of the Sponsor’s GCP Quality Assurance Department or designees may conduct an 
audit of a clinical site at any time during or after completion of the study. The investigator 
will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. 
Inspections and audits are typically carried out during the clinical and reporting phases of this study to ensure that the study is conducted and data are generated, documented, and reported 
in compliance with the protocol, GCP, written SOPs and applicable laws, rules, and 
regulations. 
Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies, including IRB/IEC 
representatives may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the 
investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately. The investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, laboratory and all data 
(including original source documentation) and all study files are available, if requested.  
Non-compliance with the protocol, ICH, GCP, or local regulatory requirements by an 
investigator, institution, institution staff, or representatives of the Sponsor will lead to prompt action by the Sponsor to secure compliance. Continued non- compliance may result in 
termination of the investigator’s involvement in the study. The IRB/IEC/REB and relevant 
regulatory authority will be informed. 
9.9. Publication 
The Sponsor recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data and therefore encourages their publication in reputable scientific journals and presentation at seminars or 
conferences. The Sponsor will retain t he ownership of the data collected in this study. The 
investigator will provide any proposed manuscript or abstract to the Sponsor before 
submission for publication or presentation of any results or data obtained in this study. 
Additional details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and 
presentations based on the data from this study will be described in the Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor and the investigator.

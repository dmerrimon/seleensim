METHODOLOGY
This is a Phase 4, randomized, open- label, assessor -blind, parallel -group, multicenter 
non-inferiorit y trial with the option for superiorit y.  Approximately  600 females undergoing COS 
following a GnRH antagonist protocol at approximately  25-30 infertility  centers in the US w ill be 
randomized 1:1 to receive either MENOPUR® or Gonal -f®.  The primary  endpoint is ongoing 
pregnancy  rate.  
On the second or third day  of spontaneous menses, gonadotropins (either MENOPUR® or Gonal -
f®) will be initiated at 150 IU for 5 days.  From sti mulation Day  6 onward, based on follicular 
response assessed b y TVUS, dosing can be adjusted every day  as needed by  75 IU per adjustment.  
However, the maximum gonadotropin dose will be 300 IU/day ; gonadotropin dosing can continue 
for a maximum of 20 days.
Once the lead follicle measures ≥14 mm and /orserum E2levels are ≥300 pg/mL, the GnRH 
antagonist (ganirelix acetate) will be initiated at a daily  dose of 0.25 mg and continued throughout 
the gonadotropin treatment period. The stimulation day  of the anta gonist start will be recorded in 
the e lectronic case report form.  A single injection of 250 μg hCG ( Ovidrel®) will be administered 
to induce final follicular maturation as soon as 3 follicles of ≥17 mm are observed on TVUS.  I n the 
case of excessive ovarian response (>30 follicles of ≥12 mm each and/or E2 levels ≥5000 pg/mL), 
the hCG trigger will be replaced wit h a GnRH agonist trigger (4 mg leuprolide acetate) and the 
fresh blastocyst transfer cancelled, with cry opreservation of all resultant viable blastocy sts
following biops y.  Oocy te retrieval will take place roughl y 36 hours after hCG administration, and 
oocytes will be inseminated by  intracy toplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 4±1 hours after retrieval; 
oocyte maturity  will be recorded.  Fertilization (number of pronuclei) will be checked on Day  1 
following oocy te retrieval.  Embry o qualit y will be assessed on D ays 3and 5following oocy te 
retrieval; in the case of late blastulation, assessments will be made on Day 6 or Day  7, as needed .  
On Day  5 following ICSI, a single blastocy st of the best quality  available will be transferred; all 
remaining blastocy sts wil l be frozen using the vitrification method.  Laser -assisted trophectoderm
biopsy  for preimplantation genetic screening will be done on expanded blastocy sts on Day  5
; in the 
case of late blasulation, biopsy  will be performed on Day 6 or Day  7, as needed.  T he PGS results 
will not be used to determine blastocy st selection for fresh transfer on Day 5 .  The evening of the

for luteal phase support and will continue until the day  of the -hCG test (10-14 days after 
blastocy sttransfer).  On the day  that the progesterone inserts are initiated, only  a single, 100 mg 
dose of ENDOMETRIN®will be given.  On subsequent day s, two (2) doses of E NDOMETRIN®
(100 mg/BID for a to tal of 200 mg/day ) will be given.  E NDOMETRIN®will be continued for a 
maximum of 10 weeks total if pregnancy  is confirmed.  For subjects with no ongoing pregnancy  in 
the fresh cy cle, single frozen blastocy st transfer can be initiated within 6months of a subject’s date 
of randomization.  
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS
Approximately  600 infertile fe males are to be randomized (300 subjects per group) .

oocy te retrieval and will continue until the day  of the second -hCG test (if negative) or if 
pregnancy  is confirmed by  the second -hCG test for a maximum of 10 weeks total.
DURATION OF TREATMENT
Subjects are treated with IMPs (either HP -hMG or Gonal -f®) for a maximum of 20 days.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample SizeCalculation
The study  has at least 80% power, with 275 subjects per treatment group, to demonstrate the non -
inferiority  of MENOPUR® to Gonal -f®in the ongoing clinical pregnancy  rate at the 1-sided 
significance level of 0.025 with a 12% non- inferiority  margin, b y assuming an ongoing pregnancy  
rate of 50% for both treatment groups ( Yeh et al . 2014). Assuming that 8% of the subjects may  not 
be eligible for the per protocol analysis set, approximately  600 subjects will be randomized (1:1) 
into this study .
Efficacy:
The primary  objective of the trial is to demonstrate the non -inferiorit y of MENOPUR®versus
Gonal -
f®with respect to ongoing pregnancy  rate in women undergoing COS following a GnRH 
antagonist protocol .  The non -inferiorit y limit for the difference between t reatments ( MENOPUR®
minus Gonal -f®) will be -12% (absolute) .  The non -inferiorit y hypothesis to be tested for the 
primary  endpoint will be:
H0: MENOPUR -Gonal -
f-12% 
against the alternative 
H1: MENOPUR -Gonal -f> -12%, where
MENOPUR and Gonal -fdenote the ongoing pregnancy  rate of subjects treated with MENOPUR®and 
Gonal -f®, respectivel y, in a single fresh blastocyst transfer following a GnRH antagonist protocol.
The null hy pothesis (H 0) will be tested against the alternative by  constructing a 2-sided 
95% confidence interval for the difference in ongoing pregnancy  rates.  Subjects who do not have at 
least 1 intrauterine pregnancy  with a detectable fetal heartbeat at 10- 11 weeks gestation (8-9weeks 
after blastocy sttransfer in the fresh cy cle), due to missing data, earl y withdrawal, or an y other 
reason will be considered treatment failures (i.e., not having ongoing pregnancy ).  If the lower -limit 
of the 95% confidence interval is greater than the non -inferiorit y limit ( -12%), the null hy pothesis 
will be rejected and it will be claimed that MENOPUR®is non -inferior to Gonal -f®with respect to 
ongoing pregnancy  rate.  The primary  efficacy  analy siswill be conducted for the modified intent-
to-treat population, defined as all randomized (as planned) subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
IMP.  If the lower bound of the confidence interval is above 0%, superiority will be declared.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
The Menotrophin vs. Recombinant FSH in vitro Fertilization Trial (MERiT )study was a large, 
randomized, open -label, multicenter, multinational study  comparing treatment outcomes of 
controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) using MENOPUR®(n=363) with those using recombinant 
follicle -stimulating hormone (rFSH ) α (Gonal -f®, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany , n=368) in in 
vitro fertilization (I VF) cy cles using a long gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist down-
regulation protocol (Andersen, 2006). The results of this study  conducted in 2005 demonstrated 
non-inferiorit y of MENOPUR®to Gonal - f®in ongoing pregnancy  rates.  Meta -analy ses h ave 
indicated that menotropins provide higher live birth rates than Gona l-f®in the long GnRH agonist
protocol (vanWelyetal.2011).  A randomized, open -label, assessor -blind, parallel -group ,
multicenter trial comparing the efficacy  of MENOPUR®and rFSH (P uregon®: Schering -Plough 
Organon) was condu cted in subjects undergoing COS following a GnRH antagonist protocol; this 
study , called MEGASET, randomized 749 subjects in Europe (Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey ) (Devroey , 2012 ).  The ongoi ng pregnancy  rates in the 
MENOPUR®and P uregon®groups were 28.9% and 26.7%, respectively , in the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population and 30.0% and 27.0%, respectively , in the per protocol (PP) population.  The non-
inferiority  of MENOPUR®to Puregon®, with re spect to the ongoing pregnancy  rate,was 
demonstrated for bo th the ITT and PP populations.
A retrospective anal ysis of data from both MERiT and MEGASET evaluated the impact of 
gonadotropin treatment on ovarian response and clinical outcome in women at risk of a high 
response and who were undergoing IVF/intracy toplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment (Arce, 
2014). Women at risk of a high response were defined as those with anti -Müllerian hormone 
(AMH) levels >75thpercentile (i.e., equivalent to >5.2 ng/mL [37.4 pmol/L ] in both studies), 
corresponding to 155 women in the 
MERiT study  and 188 women in the MEGASET study .  High 
ovarian response was defined as ≥15 oocy tes retrieved.  Treatment with MENOPUR®versus rFSH 
was associated wit h a lower median number of oocy tes retrieved in women at risk of a high 
response, irrespective of the down-regulation protocol ( Arce, 2014) .  When the data of women with 
high AMH from both protocols were integrated, MENOPUR®treatme nt was associated with a 
significantl y lower incidence of high response (32% versus 49%, p=0.001) and increased live birth 
rate per started cy cle (34% versus 22%, p=0.012) compared with rFSH treatment (Arce, 2014 ).
1.2 Scientific Justif ication for Conducting the Trial
The current study  has a similar design as the MEGASET study  conducted in Europe.  The aim of 
this study  is to demonstrate non- inferiorit y of MENOPUR®versus rFSHα (Gonal -f®) with respect 
to ongoing pregnancy  rate in potential high -responders undergoing IVF/ICSI  treatment, using an 
initial gonadotropin dose of 150 IU within a GnRH antagonist- controlled protocol.  Subjects will be 
classified as high ovarian responders based on a serum level of AMH ≥5ng/mL . The AMH

A trial flow diagram is presented in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Trial Flow Diagram
3.1.2 Overall Design and Control Methods
This is a Phase 4, randomized, open- label, assessor -blind, paral lel-group, multicenter study  to be 
conducted at approximately  25-30 infertility  centers in the United States ( US).  Approximately  600 
females undergoing COS following a GnRH antagonist protocol will be randomiz ed to receive 
either 
MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®.  The stud y is designed to demonstrate non -inferiorit y of 
MENOPUR®versus Gonal -f®for ongoing pregnancy  rates in a predefined high -responder subject 
population.  High responders will be defined as subjects who have a serum AMH ≥5ng/mL .  All 
AMH measurement s will be determined at a single reference laboratory  (ReproSource, Inc., 
Woburn, MA), utilizing materials and reagents from Beckman Coulter -
DSL (Chaska, MN).
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to undergo COS with either MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®in a GnRH 
antagonist cy cle.  Gonadotropins (either MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®) will be started on the second or 
third day of spontaneous menses.  The gonadotropin dose will be initiated at 150 IU for the first 
5days.  From s timulation Day  6 onward, based on follicular response assessed by  TVUS, dosing 
can be adjusted every  day as needed by  75 IU per adjustment.  However, the maximum 
gonadotropin dose will be 300 IU/day ; gonadotropin dosing can continue for a maximum of 
20days.  Coasting is prohibited.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALIf the lead follicle mea sures ≥14 mm and /orserum E2 levels are ≥300 pg/mL , the GnRH antagonist 
Ganirelix®(ganirelix acetate) will be initiated at a daily  dose of 0.25 mg and continued throughout 
the gonadotropin treatment period. The stimulation day of the antagonist start will be recorded in 
the electronic case report form (eCRF). A single injection of 250 μg hCG ( Ovidrel®) will be 
administered to induce final follicular maturation as soon as 3 follicles of ≥17 mm are observed on 
TVUS.  If a subject has >30 follicles that are ≥12 mm each, she will receive 4 mg of leuprolide 
acetate administered subcutaneousl y at least 12 hours after the last dose of th e GnRH antagonist .  If 
the 
GnRH agonist trigger was required, TVUS -guided oocy te retrieval will be performed 
approximately  36 hours later, and all resultant viable blastocy sts will be vitrified after 
troph
ectoderm biops y, with no fresh blastocy sttransfer to decrease risk of OHSS.
In order to minimize the risk of empty  follicle sy ndrome, the subject will return the morning after 
hCG trigger to draw serum hCG, E2, and P4 levels.  If the hCG level is <50 IU/L  and/or P4 is 
<3.5 ng/mL, then a booster/rescue second dose of hCG must be given on that dayas soon as 
possible.  If the subject received the GnR H agonist trigger, the bl oods drawn will be LH, E2, and P4
levels.  If ,after the GnRH agonist trigger, the LH is <15 IU/L and/or the P4<3.5 ng/mL, a 
rescue/booster dose of hCG (Ovidrel®) should be given as soon as possible.  Delay  of oocy te 
retrieval wil l be left to the clinician’s discretion and will be based on the time at which the rescue 
dose was administered.
Oocy te retrieval will take place approximately 36 hours after hCG administration.  Oocy tes will be 
inseminated using partner sperm b y ICSI 4±1 hours after retrieval ; oocy te maturity will be 
recorded.  F ertilization (number of pronuclei) will be checked on Day  1 following oocy te retrieval.  
Embry o quality  will be assessed on Day s 3 and 5 following oocy te retrieval; in the case of late 
blastulation , assessments will be made on Day  6 or 7, as needed. On Day 5 following ICSI, a single 
blastocy st of the best quality  available will be transferred; all remaining biopsied blastocy sts will be 
frozen using the vitrification method. Laser-assisted trophecto derm biops y for preimplantation 
genetic screening (P GS) will be done on Day 5; in the case of late blasulation, biopsy  will be 
performed on Day 6or Day  7, as needed. PGS results will not be used to select the blastocy st for 
fresh transfer.   No fresh tran sfers will be done on Day  6 or Day  7 blastocy sts.
The evening 
of the day  after oocy te retrieval, vaginal progesterone inserts (ENDOMETRIN®; 
Ferring) will be initiated for luteal phase support.  On the day  that the progesterone inserts are 
initiated, only  a single, 100 mg dose of ENDOMETRI N®will be given.  On subsequent day s, two 
(2) doses of ENDOMETRI N®(100 mg / BID for a total of 200 mg/day ) will be given.  
ENDOMETRIN®will be continued 
until the day  of the -hCG test (10-14 days after blastocy st
transfer) if negative for pregnancy  or if pregnancy is confirmed, will be continued for a maximum 
of 10 weeks .
Positive β- hCG will be confirmed b y 2 positive -hCG tests, the first performed approxima tely 10-
14days after blastocy sttransfer with a second positive test 2 day s later.  Clinical pregnancy  will be 
confirmed b y TVUS ,indicating at least 1intrauterine gestational sac with f etal heart beat at 6-7

least 1 intrauterine viable fetus at 10 -11 weeks gestation (8 -9weeks after blastocy st transfer). 
For subjects with no ongoing pregnancy  in the fresh cy cleor for those receiving agonist trigger, 
single frozen blastocy st transfer cy clescan be initiated within 6 months of a subject’s initial date of 
randomization.  Single blastocy st transfer is mandatory .  The PGS results canbe used to select a
euploid blastocy st for frozen blastocy sttransfer.  Frozen- thawed blastocy st transfer cycle data will 
be collected, including blastocy st transfer information (to include embry o grade ,euploid status, 
endometrial thickness, presence of blood/mucus on transfer catheter tip, and whether blastocy st is 
retained in the catheter requiring a second pass), -hCG test results, clinical pregnancy , ongoing 
pregnancy , and live birth .
In women undergoing COS, an excessive response to follicular- stimulating agents may  lead to the 
development of OHSS, which represents a spectrum that can be categorized as mild, moderate, or 
severe . Subjects who have an excessive response to ovarian stimulation ( >30follicles that are ≥ 12 
mmeach and/or serum E2 ≥5000 pg/mL) will have the cy cle cancelled and converted to freez e all 
with GnRH agonist trigger.  That is, the subject will receive 4mg of leuprolide acetate administered 
subcutaneousl y at least 12 hours after the last dose of the GnRH antagonist; TVUS -guided oocy te 
retrieval will be performed approximately  36 hours l ater, and all resultant blastocysts will be 
vitrified after trophectoderm biopsy , with no fresh blastocy sttransfer, to decrease the risk of OHSS.
All cases of OHSS will be considered AEs and will be recorded in the source documents for that 
subject and on the AE page in the eCRF.  Severe OHSS that requires medical or surgical 
intervention (i.e., paracentesis, hospitalization) is considered a serious adverse event (SAE).  
See Section 7.1.6 for definitions of mild, moderate, and severe OHSS.
Post-trial follow- up extends to collection of delivery  information (live birth and neonatal health to 
include APGAR scores, birth weight, gestational age at birth, presence of congenital anomaly /birth 
defect , and cause of neonatal death, if applicable ), which will be collected for all subjects with an 
ongoing pregnancy  in the fresh cy cle or the 6- month post-randomization frozen- thawed blastocy st 
transfer cycles.  Live birth rate after the fresh cy cle and cumulative live birth rate after fresh and 6-
month post-randomization frozen -thawed blastocyst transfer cycles will be evaluated as part of the 
post-trial follow-up.

otherwise noted in this protocol.  Subjects who are potential high ovarian responders will be 
enrolled; high ovarian responders will be classified based on a high serum level of AMH ≥5ng/mL 
at the start of stimulation.  Eligible subjects will be randoml y assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms, 
either MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®; COS will continue for up to 20 day s.
The primary  objective of the trial is to demonstrate the non -inferiorit y of MENOPUR®versus 
Gonal -f®with respect to ongoing pregnancy  rate in women unde rgoing COS following a GnRH 
antagonist protocol . The non -inferiorit y limit for the difference between treatments ( MENOPUR®
minus Gonal -
f®) will be -12% (absolute).
3.3.2 Selection of Endpoints
The efficacy  endpoints in this study  (ongoing pregnancy  rate, positiv e β-hCG rate, clinical 
pregnancy  rate, live birth rate, fertilization rate, number of oocy tes retrieved, embry o quality , 
aneuploidy  rate, and pregnancy  loss) are typical endpoints to demonstrate the effectiveness of 
products used for ovarian stimulation and pregnancy  in infertile subject s.  Safet y endpoints of AEs , 
laboratory results, and OHSS are also ty pical.
3.3.3 Blinding
MENOPUR®is provided in a vial (powder), while Gonal -f®is provided in a pen and cartridge 
system. Therefore, a double -blind design is not feasible. The trial ;however, is assessor -blind, 
ensuring unbiased evaluation by  the individual performing the ultrasound monitoring,
embry ologists, and central laboratory  personnel. Furthermore, the primary endpoint for this trial is 
ongoing pregnancy  rate, a clinically  objective assessment .
3.3.4 Selection of Doses in the Trial
Either MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®will be administered subcutaneously once daily  for up to 20 day s 
at a dose of 75 IU to 300IU.
3.3.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) ( MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®) will be 
initiated at 150 I U for the first 5 day s.  From stimulation Day  6 onward, based on follicular response 
assessed b y TVUS, dosing can be adjusted every  day, as needed, by  75 IU per adjustment.  
However, the maximum gonadotropin dose will be 300 IU/day ; gonadotropin dosing can continue 
for a maximum of 20 days.
3.3.6 Withdrawal Criteria
A subject that withdraws from the study  will not be replaced.  Every  subject has the right to refuse 
further participation in the study  at any  time and without providing reasons.  A subject's 
participation is to terminate immediately  upon her request.  The Investigator should seek to obtain 
the reason and record this in the source documents and eCRF .

The subject can also be w ithdrawn from the study  at any  time at the discretion of the Investigator; 
the reason should be discussed with the Sponsor prior to discontinuation and fully  documented in 
the source documents and eCRF.
3.3.7 Follow -up Procedures
Subjects will return to the stud y center for regular scheduled clinic visits as required per protocol 
for measurement of hormone levels, TVUS, pregnancy  testing, and othe r safety  assessments.  
Unscheduled visits are allowed, per Investigator discretion and standard of care.  Approximatel y 
10-14 day s after blastocyst transfer, all subjects will have a serum pregnancy  test; subjects with a 
positive test result will have a second confirmatory test performed 2 day s later.
Clinical pregnancy  will be confirmed by  TVUS, indicating at least 1 int rauterine gestational sac 
with fetal heart beat at 6-7weeks gestation ( 4 -5weeks after blastocy st transfer).  Ongoing 
pregnancy  will be confirmed by  at least 1 intrauterine viable fetus at 10 -11weeks of gestation 
(8-9weeks after blastocyst transfer).
For subjects with no ongoing pregnancy  in the fresh cy cle, single frozen blastocy st transfers can be 
initiated within 6 months of the date of the subject’s initial randomization.  The PGS results can be 
used to select a euploid blastocy st for frozen transfer (s).
Post-trial follow- up extends to collection of delivery  information (live birth and neonatal health), 
which will be collected for all subjects with an ongoing pregnancy  in the fresh cy cle or the 6- month 
post-randomization frozen- thawed blastocy st transfer cy cles.  Frozen -thawed blastocy st transfer 
cycle data will be collected, including blastocy st transfer information, β -hCG test results, clinical 
pregnancy , and ongoing pregnancy .  Live birth rate after the fresh cy cle and cumulative live birth 
rate following the fresh and 6- month post randomization start frozen -thawed cy cles (if applicable) 
will be evaluated as part of the post-trial follow- up.

When the lead follicle measures ≥14 mm and /orserum E2levels are ≥300 pg/mL, the GnRH 
antagonist (ganirelix aceta te) will be initiated at a daily  dose of 0.25 mg and continued throughout 
the gonadotropin treatment period and the exact stimulation day  of administration will be 
documented in the eCRF. 
Subjects will be monitored per the center’s standard practice durin g the stimulation dosing between 
Days 7 to 20 or until the stimulation phase is complete or study  treatment is discontinued.  
Although these visits are not protocol- specific and can vary  based on each centers standard of care, 
the results of the TVUS, E2 levels, P4 levels, concomitant medications, and AEs will be 
documented in the eCRF as unscheduled stimulation visits.  The TVUS and blood results from the 
final day  of stimulation (day  of hCG trigger administration) will be documented in the eCRF and 
blood samples sent to the central laboratory .  Since the final day  of stimulation may  not be known 
until the late afternoon or evening of the hCG trigger dose, an extra blood sample/tube will be 
collected and stored onsite for each day  of stimulation monitoring to ensure the final day  of 
stimulation is collected. Subjects will receive a single subcutaneous injection of Ovidrel®
(choriogonadotropin alfa , r-hCG )to induce final follicular maturation w hen ≥3follicles of ≥17 mm 
are detected on TVUS.  
The time between two Ganirelix®injections as well as the time between the last G anirelix injection

The su
bject will return to the center (in the morning) the day  following the Ovidrel®injection for 
P4 and E2 samples to be submitted to the central laboratory; serum hCG will be anal yzed at the 
local lab .  A TVUS will be performed.  The date, time ,and dosage o f Ovidrel®will be recorded as 
well as study  medication compliance .  Adverse events and concomitant medication s will be 
assessed and documented .  Any  symptoms of OHSS will be closely  monitored .
The cy cle will be cancelled in case of poor ovarian response ( if the Investigator judges that 
≥3follicles of ≥17 mm cannot be reached after a minimum of 10 day s of stimulation) .  
Subjects who have an excessive response to ovarian stimulation (
>30follicles of ≥12 mm and/or E2 
≥5000 pg/mL ) will have the fresh transf er cancelled , and the hCG trigger will be replaced with a 
GnRH agonist trigger (4 mg l euprolide acetate). If leuprolide acetate is administered, a blood 
sample for LH will be collected and analy zed at the local lab. All resultant expanded blastocy sts 
will be vitrified after troph ectoderm biops y, with no fresh blastocy st transfer in order to decrease
therisk of OHSS.  Following oocy te retrieval and blastocy st evaluation ,an End of Trial ( EOT )
Visit will be scheduled or completed and the inf ormation will be documented in the eCRF .
In order to minimize the risk of empty  follicle sy ndrome, the subject will return the morning after 
hCG trigger to draw serum hCG, E2, and P4 levels.  If the hCG level is <50 IU/L  and/or P4 is 
<3.5 ng/mL, then a boo ster/rescue second dose of hCG must be given on that dayas soon as 
possible.  If the subject received the GnRH agonist trigger, the bl oods drawn will be LH, E2, and 
P4levels.  If ,after the GnRH agonist trigger, the LH is <15 IU/L and/or the P4 <3.5 ng/m L, a 
rescue/booster dose of hCG (Ovidrel®) should be given as soon as possible.  Delay  of oocy te 
retrieval will be left to the clinician’s discretion and will be based on the time at which the rescue 
dose was administered.
6.5 Visit 5 - Oocytes Retrieval/Insem ination
A TVUS will be performed and oocy tes retrieved roughl y 36 hours after hCG administration.  
Oocy tes will be inseminated using partner or donor sperm by  ICSI 4±1 hours after retrieval.
  
Oocy te maturity will be assessed at the time of ICSI.  Fertiliz ation (number of pronuclei) will be 
checked on Day  1 following oocy te retrieval.  Embry os must be cultured individually  in separate 
dishes/ droplets following the Day  1 assessment .  Embry o quality  will be assessed on Day s 3and 5
following oocy te retrieval; in the case of late blasulation, assessment will be performed on Day 6or 
Day 7, as needed.  A standardized embry o grading sy stem will be used and documented in the 
eCRF.  Adverse events and concomitant medication swill be assessed and documented.
Each subject will be provided with vaginal progesterone inserts (200 mg/day  –ENDOMETRIN®) 
to begin luteal support on the evening of the day  after oocy te retrieval.  The dose will be 
administered following the instructions provided in t he package insert.  Luteal phase support will

On Day  5 following ICSI, a single blastocy st of the best quality  available will be transferred; all 
remaining blastocy sts will be frozen using the vitrification method
.  A t ransabdominal pelvic 
ultrasound or transvaginal ultrasound will be performed to assess the endometrial thickness and 
echogenicit y pattern.  Laser -assisted tr ophectoderm biopsy  for preimplantation genetic screening 
(PGS)will be done on Day 5; in the case of late blasulation, biopsy  will be performed on Day 6or 
Day 7, as needed.
  All expanded blastocy sts with Blastocy st Expansion and Hatching Status 3-6, 
Inner Cell Mass grading A or B, and Trophoectoderm Grading A, B, or C. ( Gardner & Schoolcraft, 
1999) should be biopsied.  Theresults of the PGS will n ot be available prior to the fresh blastocy st 
transfer, but can be used for subsequent frozen blastocy st transfer cy cles, if needed. Adverse events 
and concomitant medications will be assessed and documented .
The residual cells obtained from ART (includin g granulosa cells, immature eggs, eggs that do not 
fertilize , sperm that is left over after fertilization , orembry os that stop developing, developed 
abnormally , are aneu ploid or that would be discarded after other embry os are selected for embry o 
transfer or freezing )may be considered for use for further research in a future sub
-study .  Some of 
the research may  be genetic and/or may  be used for some of the following reasons.  
• To further our understanding of how patients’ genetics affect the response to medications 
designed for ovarian stimulation.
•To develop new techniques to optimize our understanding of genetic and chromosomal 
regulation in eggs, sperm, and embryos.
•To improve embryonic efficiency  by assessing genes, DNA, RNA, proteins, chromosomes
and cellular pathologies.
• To characterize normal and abnormal expression of genes and their functions, as well as 
downstream effects of transcription and translation.
•To determine the frequency  of embry o mosaicism and chromosomal irregularities 
(inver sions, translocations, deletions, etc.) 
•To study  proteins and their structure, functions, and interactions. 
Subjects who wish to participate in such a sub- study  will be asked to consent to the donati on of this 
material.
6.7 Visits 7, 8, and 9 -Pregnancy Monitoring
Visit 7: All subjects will be required to return to the clinic approximately  10-14 day s after 
blastocy st transfer for 
β-hCG assessment. If the first serum β -hCG is positive ,a second 
confirmatory  test will be performed approximately 2 day s late r.If the pregnancy test is 
negative, ENDOMETRIN®will be discontinued and EOT procedures completed.  If 
conflicting results are obtained in the first 2 tests, a third test will be performed 2 day s after 
the second test.  If a positive β -hCG is confirmed, ENDOMETRIN®will continue up to 
10 weeks from the time it was initiated until the EOT Visit.
Visit 8 : Subjects who are pregnant will return to the clinic 4-5 weeks after blastocy st 
transfer for clinical pregnancy assessment ( TVUS showing at least 1 intra uterine gestational

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALTable 2 Classification of Mild, Moderate, and Severe OHSS
Mild OHSS Grade 1 : Abdominal distension and discomfort
Grade 2: Features of Grade 1 plus nausea/vomiting and/or diarrhea.  Ovaries enlarged to 5 -12cm.1
Moderate OHSS Grade 3: Features of mild OHSS plus ultrasonic evidence of ascites.2
Severe OHSS Grade 4: Features of moderate OHSS plus clinical evidence of ascites and/or hydrothorax 
(orbreathing difficulties).  Paracentesis due to OHSS symptoms.3
Grade 5 All of the above plus change in blood volume, increased blood viscosity due to 
hemoconcentration, coagulation abnor malities, and diminished renal perfusion and function.4  
Hospitalization due to OHSS symptoms.
1. For each ovary, the size will be the average of the greatest diameter and its greatest perpendicular diameter.  Ovarian 
enlargement will be based on the average size of the right and left ovaries.  The sizes of both ovaries should be recorded.
2. For subjects with transvaginal evidence of ascites, the size of the fluid pockets in the pelvis (Douglas pouch, vesicouterine
pouch, etc.) should be estimated by measuring the greatest diameter and its greatest perpendicular diameter, and multiplying 
these 2 numbers (the unit will be cm2).  Peritoneal fluid is the total size of all fluid pockets in the pelvis.
3. In case of paracentesis, the volume of fluid drained should be measured.
4. Hemoconcentration is defined as hematocrit >45 %.  Electrolyte disturbances are defined as hyponatremia 
(sodium <135 mEq/L) and/or hyperkalemia (potassium >5.0 mEq/L).  Coagulation abnormalities are defined as presence of 
thromboemb olic events, abnormal prothrombin time, or abnormal activated partial thrombin time.  Diminished renal perfusion 
is defined as creatinine >1.2 mg/ dL.  Oliguria is defined as urine output less than 500 mL/24 hours.  Anuria is defined as failure 
to produce u rine.  If applicable, actual volume of urine output will be recorded.
All cases of OHSS will be considered AEs and will be recorded in the source documents for that 
subject and on the AEpage in the eCRF.  Severe OHSS that requires medical or surgical 
intervention (i.e., paracentesis or hospitalization) is considered a nSAE (see Section 8.4).
Early OHSS is defined as OHSS with onset ≤9 days after triggering of final follicular maturation.  
Classification of grade is according to Golan’s classification sy stem (Golan, 1989) and all OHSS 
cases will be graded a s mild, moderate ,or severe.  Preventive interventions for early
 OHSS cover 
cycle cancellation due to excessive ovarian response, triggering of final follicular maturation with 
GnRH agonist ,and administration of dopamine agonist (the latter is onl y consid ered as preventive 
intervention in subjects with ≥20 follicles of ≥12 mm).
Late OHSS is defined as OHSS with onset >9 days after triggering of final follicular maturation.
7.1.7 Concomitant Medications
At each stud y visit, subjects will be queried regarding use of any  medication other than study  drug 
since the last visit.  Any  use of prior medication or concomitant medication will be recorded in the 
source documents and eCRF and include the following information:  name of medication, total 
daily  dose, route of administration, start and stop dates, and reason for use .  If the reason for the use 
of concomitant medication meets the definition of an AE, the AE should be recorded in the source 
documents for that subject and on the AEpage in the eCRF.

The overall blastocy st quality  on D ay 5 is based on the blastocy stexpansion and hatching status, 
inner cell mass grading ,and trophectoderm grading.
Excellent -quality  blastocy sts are defined as those with blastocy st exp ansion and hatching status 4, 
5, or 6, inner cell mass grading A, and trophectoderm grading A or B.  The number and percentage 
of excellent -quality  blastocy sts on 
Day 5 is a secondary  endpoint.  This will be based on the best 
overall quality  score of the Day 5 post -insemination assessments.
Good -quality  blastocy sts are defined as those with blastocy st expans ion and hatching status 3, 4, 5,

grading A or B.  The number and percentage of 
good -quality  blastocy sts on Day 5 will be based on th e best overall qualit y score.  The number and 
percentage of excellent- quality  blastocy sts and good- quality  blastocy sts on Day5 will be 
calculated. The best blastocy st based on Day  5 morphology  will be transferred.
All expanded blastocy sts with Blastocy st Expansion and Hatching Status 3- 6, Inner Cell Mass 
grading A or B, and Trophoectoderm Grading A, B, or C. should be biopsied.
7.2.10 Compaction Assessment in Morulas
Embry os that have not reached the blastocy st stage on Day 5, but are morulas, will also be 
evaluated. Morulas will be categori zed as 1of the following 3options:
Compacted: complete compaction. Tightl y compacted cells. Individual cell membranes are 
no longer visible.
Compacting: early stage. Cells can be distinguished.
Abnormal compaction: r
egional or partial compaction, or few cells (<8) in compaction
Day 5 morulas may  be considered for extended culture as per the inv estigator/site standard of care.  
Day 6or Day  7 viable blastocy stscan then undergo troph ectoderm biops yandvitrification.  All 
expanded blastocy sts with Blastocy st Expansion and Hatching Status 3- 6, Inner Cell Mass grading 
A or B, and Trophoectoderm Gra ding A, B, or C. should be biopsied.

8.1 Adverse Event Definition
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial .  It includes:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign, s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the 
use of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by the IMP.
AEs commonly  observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the 
IMP.
Any laboratory  abnormality , vital sign, or finding from phy sical or gy necological 
examination assessed as clinically significant b y the Investigator (findings from asses sments 
and examinations done during screening are not AEs, but are recorded as medical history ).
Accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for 
any medical, nursing, or pharmacy  consultation, or reasons for admiss ion to hospital or 
surgical procedures.
Overdoses and medication errors with and without clinical consequences.
8.2 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events
8.2.1 Collection of Adverse Events
The Investigator must monitor the condition of the subject throughout the trial from the time of 
obtaining informed consent until the last visit (EOT).
The sources of AEs cover :
The subject’s response to questions about her health (a standard non -leading question such 
as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” is asked at each visit).
Symptoms spontaneously  reported by  the subject.
Investigations and examinations where the findings are assessed b y the Investigator to be 
clinically  significant changes or abnormalities.
Other information relating to the subject’s hea lth becoming known to the Investigator (e.g., 
hospitalization).
8.2.2 Recording of Adverse Events
The Investigator must record all AEs in the AE Logprovide d in each subject’s eCRF with 
information about:

Other action taken.
Date and time of outcome (time can be omitted, if not applicable).
Outcome.
Seriousness.
Each of the items in the AE L og is described in detail in the following sections.
Adverse Event
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available.  If not, separate signs and s ymptoms 
should be recorded.  One diagnosis/s ymptom should be entered per record.
If a subject suffers from the same AE more than on ce and the subject recovers in between the 
events, the AEs should be re corded separatel y.  If an AEchanges in intensity , a worst -case 
approach should be used when re cording the event, i.e ., the highest intensity  and the longest 
duration of the event.a
Note the following: aprocedure is not an AE; the reason for conducting the procedure is .  
Hospitalization is not an AE; the reason for hospitalization is .  Death is not an AE , but the cause of 
death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, whic h is an 
AE).
Date and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or sy mptom(s) were first noted.  If the AE is an 
abnormal clinicall y significant laboratory  test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the 
date the sample wa s taken or the examination was performed.  
Intensity
The intensity  of an AE must be classified using the following 3-point scale:
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.
Moderate: Event sufficient to affect usual activit y (disturbing).
Severe: Inability  to work or perform usual activiti es (unacceptable).
                                                
aException: if an AE with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pre- treatment AE) changes in 
intensity, thi s must be recorded as 2 separate events.  The initial AE should be recorded w ith outcome “not yet 
recovered” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity changed.  The second AE should be

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALCausal Relationship to IMP
The possibility  of whether the IMP caused the AE must be classified as 1 of the following:
Reasonable possibility : There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship 
between the IMP and the AE.  The AE may  occur as part of the 
pharmacological action of the IMP or may  be unpredictable in its 
occurrence.
Examples: 
AEs that are uncommon but are known to be strongl y associated with IMP exposure.
AEs that are not commonly  associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in 
association with other factors strongl y suggesting causation, such as a strong temporal 
association or the event recurs on rechallenge.
No reasonable possibility: There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Examples:
Known consequences of the underl ying disease or condition under investigation.
AEs common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to occur with some 
frequency  during the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure.
Action Taken to IMP
The action taken to the IMP in response to an AE must be classified as 1 of the following:
No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken).
Withdrawn.
Interrupted.
Dose reduced.
Dose increased.
Other Action Taken
Adverse events requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical care to 
protect the health and well- being of the subject.  Appropriate resuscitation equipment and 
medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency  situation.
If medication is administered to treat the AE, this medication should be entered in the Concomitant 
Medication Log .

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL8.4 Serious Adverse Events
8.4.1 Serious Adverse Event Definition
An event is defined an SAE if it: Guidance
results in death Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, 
including deaths occurring within 4 weeks after the treatment ends and 
irrespective of the causal relationship to the IMP.  The death of a subject 
enrolled in a trial is per se not an event, but an outcome.
is life-threatening The term life -threatening refers to an AE in which the subject w as at immediate 
risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which may 
have caused death if it were more severe.
requires inpatient hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing 
hospitalizationThe term h ospitalization means that the subject w as admitted to hospital or that 
existing hospitalization was extended as a result of an event.  Hospitalization 
describes a perio d of at least 24 hours.  An over night stay for observation, a stay 
at an emergency room , or treatment on an out patient basis do esnot constitute a 
hospitalization.  How ever, m edical judgment must always be exercised and 
when in doubt the case should be con sidered serious (i.e. ,if the case fulfil ls the 
criterion for a medically important event).  Hospitalizations for administrative 
or social purposes do not constitute an SAE.  Hospital admissions and/or 
surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not considered AEs if the 
illness or disease existed before the subject w as enrolled in the trial, provided 
that the condition did not deteriorate during the trial.
results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacityDisability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  I f in doubt, the decision should be left to 
medical judgment by the Investigator.
is a congenital anom aly/birth 
defectCongenital anomaly/birth defect observed in any offsprin g of the subject 
conceived during treatment with the IMP.
is an important m edical event Important medical events are events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above.  Examples of important medical events include AEs that 
suggest a significant hazard, contraindication or precaution, occurrence of 
malignancy ,or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether events qualify as 
medically important.
Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious 
agent via a medicinal product.  Any organism virus or infectious particle 
(e.g.,prion protein transmitting t ransmissible spongiform encephalopathy), 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious age nt.  A 
transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or 
laboratory findings indicating an infection in a subject exposed to a medicinal 
product.

This section details the planned statistical anal yses for the primary  endpoint and outlines the 
secondary  endpoints. All anal yses and further descriptions of the statistical methodology  for the 
primary  and secondary  endpoints will be included in the Statistical Analy sis Plan available before 
the first subject signs their informed consent .  An y deviations from the protocol -specified statistical 
analysis will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan or fi nal report, as appropriate. A separate 
Statistical Analy sis Plan will be prepared to cover the post -trial information.
9.1 Determination of Sample Size
The study  has at least 80% power, with 275 subjects per treatment group, to demonstrate the non -
inferiority of MENOPUR®to Gonal -f®in the ongoing clinical pregnancy  rate at the 1-sided 
significance level of 0.025 with a 12% non- inferiority  margin, b y assuming an ongoing pregnancy  
rate of 50% for both treatment groups ( Yeh et al. 2014). Assuming that 8% of the subjects may  not 
be eligible for the PP analy sis set, approximately  600 subjects will be randomized (1:1) into this 
study .
9.2 Subject Disposition
The number and percentage of subjects within each anal ysis set, randomized subjects treated with 
IMP, and subjects prematurely  discontinued from the study  will be summarized.  All post -baseline 
discontinuations will be summarized by  reason for discontinuation.  The number of subjects 
screened and not randomized will be presented.

9.6.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary  objective of the trial is to demonstrate that MENOPUR®is non -inferior to recombinant 
FSH with respect to ongoing pregnancy  rate in a sin gle fresh treatment cy cle following a GnRH 
antagonist protocol .  Ongoing pregnancy isdefined as presence of at least 1 intrauterine pregnancy  
with a detectable fetal heartbeat at 10 -11 weeks gestation (8 -9weeks after blastocy sttransfer in the 
fresh cy cle).  The non -inferiority  limit for the difference between treatments ( MENOPUR®versus 
Gonal -
f®) is -12% (absolute). The non -inferiorit y hypothesis to be test ed for the primary  endpoint 
is:
H0: MENOPUR -Gonal -f®-12% 
against the alternative 
H1: MENOPUR -Gonal -f®> -12%,
where MENOPUR and Gonal -f®denote the ongoing pregnancy  rate of subjects randomized and treated 
with MENOPUR®and Gonal -f®, respectivel y, in a single fresh embry o transfer following a GnRH 
antagonist protocol.
The null hy pothesis (H 0) will be tested against the alternative by  constructing a 2-sided 
95% confidence interval for the difference in ongoing pregnancy  rates. If the lower -limit of the 
95% confidence interval is greater than the non -inferiorit y limit ( -12%), the null hy pothesis will be

10.1 Source Data and Source Documents
Source Data – I nternational Conference on Harm onization (I CH)Definition
Source data are defined as all information in original records and certified copies of original records 
of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary  for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents (original 
records or certified copies).
Source Documents - ICH Definition
Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records (e.g., hospital records, 
clinical and office charts , laboratory  notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy  dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions 
certified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic nega tives, microfilm 
or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy , at the laboratories ,and 
at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial).
Trial -Specific Source Data Requirements –Ferring
Any study  specific sour ce data will be described and defined in the monitoring manual produced 
for this study . 
10.2 eCRF/C ase Report Form
An electronic data capture system provided by  an independent third- party  will be used.  The s ystem 
is validated and access at all levels to the system is granted/revoked following Ferring and vendor 
procedures, in accordance with regulatory  and sy stem requirements.
Data should be entered into the sy stem within 3 working day s after the subject has attended a visit 
or after the data become available , as applicable.
The eCRF s ystem and the database will be hosted at the independent third party  CRO.  After the 
trial database is declared clean and released to the statistician, a final copy  of the database will be 
stored at Ferring.  The Investigator will also receive a cop y of the trial site’s final and locked data 
(including audit trail, electronic signature , and queries) as write- protected PDF files produced b y 
the independent third party  CRO.  The PDF files will be stored on a CD and will be provided to the 
Investigator before access to the eCRF is revoked.
Errors occurring in the eCRF will be corrected electronicall y.  Such corrections/modifications will 
be automaticall y tracked by an audit trail detailing the date and time of the correction and the n ame 
of the person making the correction.
The Investigator will approve/authorize the eCRF entries for each subject with an electronic 
signature that is equivalent to a handwritten signature.

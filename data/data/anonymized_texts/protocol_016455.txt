Study  Number:  
MCP -103-205 
Study  Title:  
A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group, Dose- range -
finding Study of MD-7246 Administered Orally for 12 Weeks to Treat Abdominal Pain in 
Patients with Diarrhea -predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome  
Study  Centers:  
Approximately 80 in the United States  
Development  Phase:  2 
Objective(s) : 
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability, treatment effect on abdominal pain, and dose response of MD -7246 administered oral ly to patients with diarrhea-
predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS -D). An exploratory objective of the study is to 
assess bowel function changes with MD -7246 in patients with IBS -D. 
Meth odology: 
This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, 
dose- range-finding, 12-week study, consisting of 4 distinct periods, as illustrated in the figure 
below . The study will enroll patients who have IBS-D diagn osed using Rome IV criteria. 
Eligible patients will be randomized in equal proportions to 1 of 4 treatments: 300, 600, or 1200 µg of MD -7246, or matching placebo, administered once daily . MD -7246 is a delayed 
release (DR) tablet formulation of linaclotide  designed to release linaclotide in the distal ileum 
near the ileocecal junction , to target guanylate cyclase C (GC -C) receptors in the colon and 
minimize secretory effects in the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract .

Randomization Visit and at study visits throughout the Treatment Period. A list of 
these assessments and the visits when they will be performed is provided under Study Visit Assessments in the Study Procedures  section below  
Patients will complete a Week 2  Phone Call, and Week 4 , Week 8 , and Week 12/End of 
Treatment (EOT ) Visits during the Treatment Period (se e Schedule of Evaluations ). 
4. Posttreatment Period:  The Posttreatment Period starts on the day following the last day of 
dosing (Week 12/EOT Visit) and finishes 2 weeks later at the End of Study (EOS) Follow-up Phone Call. During the call , patients will be a sked to report any AEs and medicines  
taken since t he Week 12/EOT Visit and detail any other symptoms or comments they may 
have (at the discretion of the investigator, patients may be reques ted to return to the study 
center for their EOS Follow-up). 
 
Overall Study Stopping Criteria and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
The Sponsor may stop enrollment prematurely because of low recruitment rates. The Sponsor 
may suspend or terminate the study prematurely because of a change in opinion of the Institutional Review Board , DMC, or a regulatory authority decision. 
An independent DMC will regularly review safety data during the conduct of the study. Periodic safety review meetings will be scheduled when approximately 1/3 and 2/3 of patients have been randomized. The committee will review accumulated sa fety data, and may request 
unblinding of the treatment groups, in order to make any recommendations regarding the acceptability of continuing the study based on AEs reported. 
Study Procedures  
During the Pretreatment and  Treatment  Periods, patients will enter information into the 
eDiary. Certain information will be entered by the patient on an event-driven basis, in a daily evening report, and on a weekly basis, as specified below.

Confidential  Page 13 of 118 Exploratory Assessments  
Exploratory assessments are based on the following eDiary BM-related questions; these non-
efficacy assessments will inform e valuation of whether MD -7246 affects bowel function:  
• BM frequen cy (date and time)  
• Stool consistency on a 5-point ordinal scale 
• Stool consistency on the 7-point BSFS 
• BM urgency on a binary scale 
• Use of loperamide for diarrhea  
• Weekly patient assessment of BM -related symptom severity on a 5 -point ordinal scale 
• Weekly pat ient assessment of BM -related symptom change on a 7-point ordinal scale 
 
Safety  Measures : 
Adverse event ( AE) recording (each visit), clinical laboratory measures (chemistry and 
hematology: Screening, Randomization, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12/E OT Visits),  body 
weight (each visit), vital sign parameters (each visit).  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations 
The Screened Population consists of all patients who had a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and were assigned a patient identification (PID) number. 
The Inte nt-to-Treat (ITT) Population consists of all randomized patients. 
The Safety Population consis ts of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
General Methods  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT Population for all outcomes reported during 
the Treatment Period using treatment group assigned at the Randomization Visit. Unless otherwise specified, all confidence intervals (CIs) will be 2 -sided and with a confidence level 
of 95%. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity in the conduct of comparisons among the MD -7246 doses relative to placebo for the key efficacy endpoints, or in the analysis of the 
additional efficacy endpoints or exploratory endpoints. Safety analyses will be performed using descriptive summaries  based on the Safety Population and on actual treatment received. 
For analysis of continuous parameters (eg, chan ge from baseline), descriptive statistics (n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, and range) will be calculated and presented for each treatment group. For categori cal parameters (eg, responder vs. non-responder), the number and 
percentage of each category will be calculated and presented for each treatment group. Percentages will be based on the total number of non- missing values; the number missing will 
be presented, but without a percentage.

Confidential  Page 14 of 118 Key Efficacy Endpoints 
• Change from Baseline in Abdominal Pain at its Worst at Each Week  
The weekly abdominal pain at its worst score is the average of the non -missing abdominal 
pain scores during each week (Weeks 1 -12) in the study. The baseline abdominal pain 
score is the average of the non -missing ab dominal pain scores during the last 14 day s of 
the Pretreatment Period and the day of the Randomization Visit reported prior to 
randomization. Change from baseline will be calcula ted for each week as the weekly score 
minus the baseline score.  
• 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain 30% Responder 
A 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain 30% Responder is a patient who meets the Weekly 
Abdominal Pain 30% Responder criteria for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. A Weekly Abdominal Pain 30% Responder is a patient who ha s a decrease from 
baseline of at least 30% in the mean abdominal pain at its worst score for that week. If a patient did not enter information into the eDiary on at least 4 days f or a particular 
Treatment Period week, the patient will not be considered a W eekly Abdominal Pain 30% 
Responder for that week. 
 
Key Efficacy Analysis  
Comparisons between the MD -7246 dose groups and placebo with regard to the change from 
baseline in abdomi nal pain over the Treatment Period will be evaluated employing a mixed 
model with repeated measures (MMRM) framework with week (categorical), treatment, geographic region, and week-by- treatment fixed effects, patient as the random effect, and 
baseline value as a covariate. An unstructured covariance structure will be utilized. Descriptive statistics, for the overall Treatment Period effect, based on the MMRM model will include least -squares (LS) mean change from baseline for each treatment, the LS mean 
difference between each MD-7246 dose and placebo, corresponding 95% CIs, and the p- value 
associated with the comparison. In addition, weekly treatment differences between each MD -
7246 dose group and placebo will be provided using the same MMRM model defined above.  
For the 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain 30% Responder endpoint, the proportion of responders in each MD -7246 group will be compared to the proportion of responders in the placebo group 
using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for geographic reg ion. The number 
and percent of responders, the difference in responder rates between each MD-7246 group and 
the placebo group, the odds ratio relative to placebo, all corresponding 95% CIs, and the p-value associated with the CMH test will be presented.

abdominal pain at its worst ranged from 2.32 to 2.88. Assuming a clinically meaningful treatment difference between MD -7246 and placebo of 1.0 for the mean change from baseline 
to Week 12 in abdominal pain, a standard deviation of 2.4, and 92 patients pe r treatment group 
(368 total), the estimated power is approximately 80% to detect a difference between each 
MD-7246 dose and placebo at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using a 2-sample t -test.

a. Site personnel will interact with IWRS to register the patient visit. Refer to the IWRS User Manual. 
b. A physical examination includes , at minimum,  the following: general appearance, HEENT (head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat), cardi ac, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal,  musculoskeletal, neurologic al, and dermatological systems . Rectal examination s should be performed at the discretion of the investigator; 
the purpose of the rectal examination is to rule out pathologies that might be caused by obstruction . Breast and genitourinary examinations are not required.  
c. Height is measured only at the Screening Visit.  
d. Vital signs must be obtained in the seated position and include oral temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and pulse. Pulse and blood pressur e 
readings will be taken after the patient has been sitting for 5 minutes.  
e. At the Screening Visit, information related to concomitant medicine that patients are taking on the day of the visit will be captured  as well as their history of 
using particular tr eatments for IBS (approved or unapproved) .

g. Required for females of childbearing potential only. To be eligible to continue in the study, a negative serum pregnancy test mus t be documented at the 
Screening Visit. A negative urine pregnancy test must be documented at the Randomization Visit (prior to dosing) , and serum pregnancy test results must be 
documented at the Week 12/ EOT Visit.  
h. Protocol -permitted loperamide for diarrhe a will be supplied to patients at the Screening  Visit and, if needed, at the Pretreatment Visit, subsequent study drug 
dispensing visits , and the Week 12/EOT Visit.  
i. All AEs occurring after the patient signs the ICF will be captured.  
j. At the Pretreatment Vis it and all subsequent visits, the study coordinator will register the patient visit to the clinic in the patient’s eDiary. At the Pretreatment 
Visit, the study coordinator will instruct the patients about the use of the eDiary.  Refer to the eDiary User Man ual. 
k. An eDiary  will be used for recording Daily Abdominal Symptom A ssessments, BM -related Assessments, Weekly Assessments, Pain Catastrophizing Scale 
(Pretreatment  Visit only), SF -12v2, EQ -5D, IBS -SSS, and any use of loperamide for diarrhea. Patients will enter BMs and loperamide use in the eDiary on 
an event -driven basis , and will complete an evening entry each day to record daily assessments, including any BMs and/or loperamide use not previously 
recorded for that day, and weekly assessments.  At the Rando mization Visit, eDiary assessments will be completed in clinic prior to randomization.  
l. At the Randomization Visit and all subsequent visits , the study coordinator will review the eDiary entry information to verify patient compliance with the 
daily eDiary completion requirement. After determining the patient’s compliance, the study coordinator will remind patients to complete the  eDiary daily  
(except at the EOT  Visit) ; eDiary compliance reminder will also occur during the Week 2 Phone Call . 
m. Study drug will be administered in the clinic at the Randomization Visit. On all other days, study drug will be taken once daily at approximately the same 
time of day without regard to food.  
n. Appropriate site personnel will contact  patients by phone to assess f or AEs , recor d concomitant medicines,  and (at Week 2 only) remind patients to comply 
with study drug and eDiary completion . Any AE or concomitant medicine reported during the phone call will be captured on the eCRF. Patients who report 
AEs during the call will be provided with instructions on the appropriate follow -up care. At the discretion of the investigator, patients may be requested to 
return to the clinic for th is contact  or an unscheduled visit may be conducted  following  the phone call.  
o. Throughout the Pretreatmen t and  Treatment Periods , the eDiary will send automated alerts  to the investigator if patients experience episodes of  constipation 
with excessive use of loperamide or diarrhea that is not well managed with the use of loperamide  (as defined in Section 8.2.6 ). In the event of an alert, the 
investigator must revie w with the patient their use of loperamide  and their patter n of constipation or diarrhea . 
p. Patients who are randomized but do not complete the Treatment Per iod (withdraw consent or are discontinued before they have completed 12 weeks of 
treatment), will be considered Treatment Period withdrawals  and should complete the procedures required at the EOT Visit (even if out of window).

3.1 IRRITABLE BOWEL SYND ROME (IBS)  
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder 
characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with defecation and/or a change in stool 
frequency or form . In addition to the characteristic abdominal pain , IBS is often associated with 
abdominal distension and bloating.( 1-6) In moderate to severe cases of IBS, an overall 
deterioration in quality of life (QOL) is often present. (7) IBS is one of the most frequently seen 
disorders in the United States; data suggest the prevalence of IBS is 11-14% of the adult population.( 7) 
IBS is subtyped based on predominant stool form as IBS with diarrhea (IBS -D), IBS with 
constipation (IBS- C), or IBS mixed (IBS-M ; mixed constipation and diarrhea), according to  the 
Rome diagnostic criteria . IBS p atients wh o rarely or never have abnormal stools or do not fit into 
1 of the 3 main IBS subtypes are subtyped as unclassified IBS ( IBS-U).(8)

IBS-D. MD -7246 is a n orally administered , delayed release (DR) tablet formulation of 
linaclotide  designed to target guanylate cyclase C (GC -C) receptors in the colon and minimize 
secretory effects . 
Linaclotide is a minimally  absorbed 14-amino acid synthetic peptide agonist of GC-C. 
Linaclotide and its active metabolite bind to and activate GC -C on the luminal surface of the 
intestinal epithelial cells. As a GC -C agonist, linaclotide ( and its active metabolite ) improves 
bowel symptoms and abdominal pain via agonism of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
on the intestinal mucosa. Activation of GC- C results in an increase in concentrations of cGMP, 
both extracellularly and intracellularly.  Orally administered linaclotide has also been shown to 
reduce visceral hyper sensitivity  in animal models and abdominal pain in patients with IBS-C.(9) 
Extracellular cGMP in the serosal space is believed to modulate the activity of local afferent (sensory) nerve fibers. Increases in cGMP within the intestinal epithelial cells triggers a signal 
transduction cascade, leading to activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) ion channels. This activation causes secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into 
the intestinal lumen, resulting in increased luminal fluid secretion and acceleration of intestinal 
transit. (10) These effects on fluid dynamics within the GI tract are believed to play a role in 
accelerating intestinal transit and increasing stool water,  which in turn results in softer stools. 
LINZESS
® is an orally administered, immediate release (IR) capsule formulation of linaclotide 
approved by the US FDA in 2012 at two dosage strengths: 290 µg for the treatment of IBS -C in 
adults, and 145 µg for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults. In 2017, 
US FDA also approved linaclotide ( LINZESS®) 72 µg IR capsules for the treatment of CIC. The 
FDA -approved linaclotide IR formulation is a rapidly dissolving capsule, and dissolution tests 
suggest that it is released primarily in the stomach.  
DR tablet formulations of linaclotide were developed with the hypothesis that delayed delivery of linaclotide will limit fluid secretion in the small intestine and maintain the nociceptive effects 
of the drug by enabling higher concentrations of linaclotide to interact with GC-C in the colon.

• DR formulation 2 (DR2) , also  referred to as MD -7246, was designed to target the distal 
ileum near the ileocecal junction to relieve pain and minimize secretory effects  in the GI 
tract.  
 
Although GC-C is found throughout the GI tract, when administered as LINZESS®, linaclotide 
and its active metabolite are likely to have the greatest activity in the proximal region of the 
small intestine, due to metabolism within the GI tract.  Preclinical experiments have shown tha t 
both linaclotide and its metabolite are degraded into smaller peptide fragments and amino acids 
in the reducing environment of the small intestine.( 11) This degradation may reduce the amount 
of linaclotide available to engage GC -C receptors in the distal ileum and colon when 
administered as LINZESS®. Some linaclotide or its active metabolite can traverse the entire GI 
tract; in a Phase 1 clinical study with LINZESS®, approximately  5% of the oral dose was 
recovered in the feces of healthy volunteers, primarily in the form of the active metabolite. 
However, linaclotide is not expected to reliably reach the colon at high concentrations following 
oral administration of LINZESS®. MD -7246 (t he DR2  formulation ) may allow higher 
concentrations of linaclotide to be delivered to the colon, bypassing the GC- C receptors in the 
duodenum, jejunum, and proximal ileum (where the effects o f increased luminal fluid secretion 
are more pronounced than in the colon, which has a higher re-absorptive capability), and 
avoiding degradation in the proximal small intestine.  
The MD -7246 tablets consist of linaclotide tablet cores coated with pH -dependent enteric 
polymers that dissolve at the pH levels encountered in the distal small intestine. Once the 
functional delayed- release coat dissolves, t he linaclotide tablet core dissolves  
 It is anticipated that delivery of linaclotide to  the lower intestine will limit CFTR -mediated 
fluid secretion, thus having little impact on bowel function and stool form, and will enable the 
deliv ery of higher concentrations of linaclotide directly to interact with GC- C in the large 
intestine, the hypothesized source of pain for patients with IBS.

Confidential  Page 35 of 118 The Phase 2b  study (MCP -103-204) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-
dummy, placebo-controlled, pa rallel -group, dose-range-finding study evaluating the two  DR 
tablet formulations  of linaclotide administered once daily for 12 weeks. A total of 532 patients 
with IBS -C (Rome III criteria) were randomized in equal proportions to 1 of 8 treatment groups: 
• Linaclotide DR1 (30 µg, 100 µg, or 300 µg) 
• Linaclotide DR2 (30 µg, 100 µg, or 300 µg)  
• LINZESS® (Linaclotide IR) 290 µg 
• Placebo  
 
All patients randomized to treatment ( Intent- to-treat [ ITT] Population) took at least 1 dose of 
study drug (Safety Population). Pa tients were instructed to take the study drug in the morning, 
under fasted conditions. Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics were generally 
similar across the treatment groups, which each included 66-67 patients. Efficacy results for the 
linaclotide DR2 and placebo groups and safety results for the linaclotide DR2, linaclotide IR, and 
placebo groups are summarized below.  
As hypothesized, the linaclotide DR2 formulation had minimal effects on bowel function (frequency and stool form) but showed a signal of benefit on abdominal pain relief. Mean 
reductions and percent reductions from baseline in abdominal pain for all linaclotide DR2 groups 
were numerically greater than for the placebo group over the entire Treatment Period and at each 
week. All l inaclotide DR2 groups showed numerically higher responder rates than the placebo 
group for the following abdominal pain responder endpoints: 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain Sustained Responder and 9/12 Week Abdominal Pain Responder and Sustained Responder. For 
change in complete spontaneous bowel movement ( CSBM ) frequency over the entire Treatment 
Period, the linaclotide DR2 groups showed no dose response, with only the lowest dose group 
having a numerically higher CSBM frequency compared with the placebo group. T here was no 
dose response for any CSBM +1 responder rate for linaclotide DR2. Overall, the l inaclotide DR2 
formulation showed an abdominal pain relief signal with minimal to no secretory effects.

Confidential  Page 36 of 118 The linaclotide DR 2 formulation was  well tolerated and did not identify any new safety signals 
relative to the linaclotide IR formulation.  There were no deaths reported in the study. Two 
patients (1 each in the placebo and linaclotide IR groups) reported a total of 3 on- therapy SAEs, 
(pneumonia, sepsis, and gastroe nteritis) that were considered by the investigator to be unrelated 
to study drug. TEAEs occurred in 30.3% of placebo-treated patients, 40.9% of linaclotide IR-
treated patients, and 22.4-30.3% of linaclotide DR2 patients. No TEAE was reported by ≥5% of 
patients in any of the linaclotide DR2 groups. Diarrhea was the most common TEAE in the 
study, but was reported infrequently in the placebo (1.5%) and linaclotide DR2 groups (0.0-3.0%) compared with the linaclotide IR group (13.6%) . All diarrhea TE AEs were mil d to 
moderate in severity. Diarrhea resulted in the discontinuation of 4 patients in the linaclotide IR group; no patient in the placebo or linaclotide DR2 groups discontinued due to diarrhea. 
In the Phase 1 multiple -dose study (MCP-103-105) of the linaclo tide DR2 formulation, 3 cohorts 
of 8 subjects each w ere randomized to receive linaclotide DR2 (6 subjects) or placebo 
(2 subjects) for 7 days. In total, 6 subjects each were randomized to linaclotide DR2 300, 1200, 
or 3000 µg or placebo. Linaclotide and it s metabolite were not quantifiable in any plasma 
samples from this study (LLOQ of 0.100 ng/mL for both analytes) and PK parameters could not 
be calculated,  indicating negligible systemic exposure following 7 days of oral administration of 
the linaclotide D R2 formulation at doses up to 3000 µg/day under fed conditions. 
There were no SAEs, deaths, or AEs leading to discontinuation in this Phase 1 multiple -dose 
study. All AEs were mild in severity . TEAEs were reported by 16.7%, 16.7%, and 33.3% of 
subject s in the linaclotide DR2 300, 1200, and 3000 µg groups, respectively, and 50.0% of 
subjects in the placebo group. No TEAE was reported by >1 subject. TEAEs were most 
frequently reported in the GI  disorders system organ class (SOC ); 16.7% of linaclotide DR2 
3000 µg subjects and 50.0% of placebo subjects reported TEAEs in the GI disorders SOC. No diarrhea TEAEs were reported . 
The linaclotide DR2 formulation (hereafter referred to as MD -7246) will be evaluated in this 
study for the treatment of abdominal pain assoc iated with IBS -D. This is the first study of 
linaclotide in IBS -D patients.

5.1.1.1 Screening Period  
The Screening Period starts with the signing of the ICF  (Appendix 1) and may last for up to 
28 days. During this period, patient eligibility for entry into the Pretreatment Period will be 
determined. Loperamide, a p rotocol- permitted OTC medication for diarrhea, will be distributed 
to eligible patients beginning at the Screening Visit. The end of the Screening Period coincides 
with the start of the Pretreatment Period. If  the patient meets the entry criteria assessed at the 
Screening Visit and does not require a washout of prohibited medicines (see Appendix 2), the Screening Visit and Pretreatment Visit may be combined into one visit.  
5.1.1.2 Pretreatment Period  
The Pretreatment Period is defined as the 14 to 21 days immediately before the Randomization Visit. During this period, patients will provide the following information in a handheld electronic 
diary (eDiary):  
• Daily Assessments 
- Daily Abdominal Symptom Assessments in a  daily  evening report  
- Bowel Movement ( BM)-related Assessments on an event -driven basis ( meaning these are 
assessments made for each event at the time the event occurs [or during the daily evening 
report for any events not previously entered for that day] ) 
• Weekly Assessments  
- Weekly Patient Assessment of Degree of Relief of IBS Symptoms  
- Weekly Patient Assessment of Adequate Relief  of IBS Pain  
- Weekly Patient Assessment of BM -related Symptom Severity  (patient global impress ion 
of severit y [PGI -S]) 
- Weekly Patient Assessment of BM -related Symptom Change (patient global impression 
of change [PGI -C]) 
• Use of Loperamide for Diarrhea  on an event-driven basis 
 
Patients who satisfy all entry criteria will enter the Treatment Period.

The Treatment Period begins with treatment assignment and lasts for 12 weeks. Patients will be 
randomized in equal proportions to 1 of 4 treatments: 300, 600, or 1200 µg  of MD -7246 or 
matching placebo. Patients will take their initial dose  of study drug  at the study center during the 
Randomization Visit. On all other days, study drug will be taken once daily at approximately the 
same time of day without regard to food (patients will be instructed to choose a time that is convenient for them and continue daily dosing at that time throughout the Treatment Period). 
Patients will continue to use the handheld eDiary to provide their: 
• Daily Assessments 
- Daily Abdominal Symptom Assessments in a  daily  evening report  
- BM-related Assessments on an event -driven basis (meaning these are assessments made 
for each event at the time the event occurs [or during the daily evening report for any 
events not previously entered for that day]) 
• Weekly Assessments  
- Weekly Patient Assessment of Degree of Relief of IBS S ymptoms  
- Weekly Patient Assessment of Adequate Relief  of IBS Pain  
- Weekly Patient Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction  
- Weekly Patient Assessment of BM -related Symptom Severity  (PGI -S) 
- Weekly Patient Assessment of BM -related Symptom Change (PGI -C) 
• Use of Lope ramide for Diarrhea on an event-driven basis 
• Health -related q uality -of-life and patient -outcome assessments  (ie, Short Form-12 Health 
Survey version 2 [SF-12v2], EuroQol-5 Dimension [EQ-5D- 3L], and Irritable Bowel 
Syndrome- Symptom Severity Scale [IBS -SSS]) will be performed at the Randomization 
Visit and at study visits throughout the Treatment Period. A list of these assessments and the visits when they will be performed is provided in the Schedule of Evaluations . 
 
Patients will complete a Week 2  Phone Cal l, and Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12/End of 
Treatment (EOT) Visits during the Treatment Period (see Schedule of Evaluations ).

The Posttreatment Period starts on the day following the last day of dosing (Week 12/EOT Visit) 
and finishes 2 weeks later at the End of Study (EOS) Follow-up Phone Call. During the call, 
patients will be asked to report any AEs and medicines taken since the Week 12/EOT Visit and 
detail any other symptoms or comments they may have (at the discretion of the investig ator, 
patients may be requested to return to the study center for their EOS Follow-up). 
5.1.2 Stopping Criteria  and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
5.1.2.1 Study Drug Discontinuation Criteria for Individual Patients 
A patient will be discontinued from study drug dosing in the event of a confirmed pregnancy (see 
Section 8.2.1.4.2).  
Dosing of study drug for an individual patient will be suspended for up to 5 days and a patient may be discontinued from study drug dosing for the following reasons:  
• An SAE considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to study drug (per causality 
definitions in Section 8.2.1.2.2 and SAE definition in Section 8.2.1.1) 
• Evidence of significant volume depletion and/or significant electrolyte abnormalities that are 
considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be associated with  diarrhea related to study drug 
• A vital sign and/or laboratory abnormality judged to be clinically significant by the 
investigator and that, in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor, is related to study drug 
• The occurrence of any other AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor, is related to study drug and  represents a clinically significant safety risk to  the patient  
 
The investigator will determine if the patient can continue in the study based on seriousness and 
severity of the AE  and the patient's history. Procedures required for discontinued patients are 
detailed i n Section 6.3. 
5.1.2.2 Overall Study Stopping Criteria  
The Sponsor may stop enrollment prematurely because of low recruitment rates. 
The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study prematurely because of a change in opinion of 
the IRB, DMC  (as detailed in Section 5.1.2.3), or a regulatory authority decision.

Confidential  Page 43 of 118 5.1.2.3 Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent DMC will regularly review safety data during the conduct of the study. Periodic 
safety review meetings will be scheduled when approximately 1/3 and 2/3 of patients have been 
randomized. The committee will review accumulated safety data, and may request unblinding of 
the treatment groups, in order to make any recommendations regarding the acceptability of 
continuing the study based on AEs reported. Details of the DMC membership, standard 
operational procedures for data monitoring/review, frequency of review, and other pertinent 
details will be provided in a separate DMC Charter.  
5.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN AND CONTROL GROUP  
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design was chosen in accordance with the concepts in ICH E10, Choice of Control Groups and Related Issues in Clinical Trials, in 
order to provide comparable treatment groups and minimal chance of selection or investigator 
bias. The study has a 14-21 day P retreatment Period to establish a baseline without study drug  
and to familiarize patients with data collection  methodology (ie, eDia ry), a 12- week Treatment 
Period to compare the test treatment to a placebo control, and a 2- week Posttreatment Period to 
assess safety  after MD -7246 treatment has been withdrawn . 
The study will evaluate the effect of the test treatment on abdominal pain in  IBS-D patients.  
Because the test treatment is not expected to significantly affect bowel function , loperamide will 
be provided beginning at the Screening Visit for patients to use as needed, at the patients’ 
discretion, to stabilize their diarrhea throughout the study ; utilization of loperamide for diarrhea 
will be recorded on an event -driven basis. 
5.3 STUDY DURATION 
The test product and reference therapy will be administered for 12 weeks. Total patient 
participation will be up to 151 days, including the Screening, Pretreatment, Treatment, and 
Posttreatment Periods.

Period withdrawals and should complete the procedures required at the EOT Visit (even if out of window) at the time of their discontinuation. The reasons for premature discontinuation from the 
study will be documented on the study termination form of the eCRF. All data on the patient 
prior to discontinuation will be made available to Ironwood (or designee). Any patient who 
withdraws because of an AE will be followed until the AE resolves, stabilizes, or ca n be 
explained as being unrelated to study drug. The study  centers should make a reasonable effort to 
follow pregnant patients until delivery or end of the pregnancy.

All study drug  will be supplied in blinded cartons  containing five  4x7 blister cards , a total of 
thirty -five (35) days of study drug doses per carton . Each blister card will contain 7 days of study 
drug doses ( a total of 28 tablets  of MD -7246 [ labeled as linaclotide DR2 ] 300 µg and/or 
matching placebo, as described in Section 7.1) ; patients will take 1 row  of tablets  (4 tablets) each 
day, as clearly marked on the blister card. Blister strips  will be manufactured using Dessiflex® 
desiccated film  and asse mbled into cardstock for the blister cards . Blister cards and cartons will 
be uniquely numbered and labeled in a double-blind fashion that conforms to regulatory 
requirements.  
All study drug will be provided by  on behalf of Ironwood 
Pharmaceuticals . MD -7246 (labeled as linaclotide DR2) and matching placebo tablets  will be 
stored at  refrigerated conditions at  the study center in an appropriate secure, temperatur e-
controlled area at 36-46°F ( 2-8°C) , with excursions permitted up to 77°F (25°C) for up to 
24 hours. Any deviations from the storage conditions must be reported to Ironwood and use of the study medication suspended until authorization for its continued use has been provided by 
Ironwood. 
Patients will be instructed to store study drug at room temperature (68-77°F  [20-25°C]).  
7.3 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMEN T GROUPS  
The patient identification (PID) number will consist of  7 digits; the first 3 digits represent the 
study center number, followed by a 1- digit study indicato r (‘5’) and a 3-digit patient number 
assigned in an ascending sequential order, beginning with 001, 002, etc. The patient will retain 
the same PID number ( which is also the Screening Number) throughout the Treatment and 
Posttreatment Period s. 
Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized into the study at the Randomization Visit on Day 1. Approximately 368 patients will 
be randomized to 1 of 4 treatments : MD -7246 300, 600, or 1200 µg  or placebo (1:1 :1:1) , as 
described in Section  7.1. Randomization numbers will be assigned by IWRS.

Confidential  Page 52 of 118 7.4 SELECTION OF DOSAGE IN THE STUDY 
This protocol is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability, treatment effect on abdominal 
pain, and dose response of MD -7246 ( previously referred to as linaclotide DR2 ) in IBS -D 
patients . The doses of MD -7246 were selected based on safety and to lerabilit y results from prior 
clinical experience with this DR formulation of linaclotide and nonclinical pharmacology models 
of visceral pain.  
In the Phase 1 PK/pharmacodynamic ( PD) study MCP -103-105, linaclotide DR2 was well 
tolerated by 18  healthy subje cts when administered for 7 days at doses of 300, 1200, and 
3000 µg per day ( 6 subjects at each dose) ; AEs for linaclotide DR2 subjects were similar to 
placebo  and all AEs were mild in severity. The 300- µg dose was  also well tolerated in 2 prior 
clinical studies: a s a single dose in 16 healthy subjects in the Phase 1 PK and food effect study 
MCP -103-104, and as chronic dosing (once daily for 12 weeks) in 66 IBS -C patients in the Phase 
2b study MCP-103-204. 
Linaclotide binds the GC-C receptor on human intestinal epithelial cell lines (T84 cells) at both 
high-affinity (K i1 of 1.23 nM) and low- affinity (K i2 of 156 nM) sites with high specificity. 
Binding of linaclotide to human intestinal (T84) cells stimulates cGMP production in a concentration -dependent manner, with a  half maximal effective concentration  (EC
50) of about 
100 nM. A dose of 300 µg of linaclotide administered to the colon in humans will result in localized concentrations 2 - to 10-fold the EC
50 of linaclotide. Efficacy was observed on non-
clinical models of visceral hypersensitivity at doses of 2.5 µg/kg, which is a human equivalent of approximately 300 µ g. 
The 600- µg and 1200- µg doses of MD -7246 w ere selected as  incremental steps from the 300- µg 
dose to allow for evaluation of dose response in efficacy . Based on the safety and tolerability at 
doses up to 3000 µg in healthy subjects, the planned MD -7246 doses of 300, 600, and 1200 µg 
are expected to be safe and well tolerated in IBS -D patients.

Confidential  Page 53 of 118 7.5 SELECTION AND TIMING  OF DOSE FOR EACH PATIENT  
All study drug will be administered orally once daily. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria at 
the Screening , Pretreatment , and Randomization Visits will be randomized to treatment at the 
Randomization Visit ( as described in Secti on 7.3; randomization number assigned by IWRS) and 
dispensed a carton with 5 blister cards, each  containing 28 tablets  (140 tablets tota l). Additional 
blister cards  will be dispensed at subsequent visits per the Schedule of Evaluations . Patients will 
take their initial dose of study drug (1 row of tablets from the blister card; 4 tablets) at  the study 
center during the Randomization Visit. For the remainder of the Treatment Period , patients will 
be instructed to take 1 row  of tablets  (4 tablets) from the blister card each day, at approximately 
the same time of  day without regard to food (patients will be instructed to choose a time that is 
convenient for them and continue once- daily dosing at that time throughout the Treatment 
Period). Patients will be instructed to return all unused study drug and blister card s to the study 
center at the visits defined in the Schedule of Evaluations . 
The investigator may allow a patient to stop taking study drug for up to 5 days s hould an 
intolerable AE occur, as described in Section 6.3. 
7.6 BLINDING  
The Sponsor study personnel, t he investigator and all other site study personnel, and the patient  
will remain blinded to individual patient  treatment assignments throughout the study. Specific 
designated personnel in the Global Patient Safety (GPS)  group at Ironwood may be unblinded to 
the treatment assignment of individual patient s for regulatory repor ting purposes. 
Patient randomization codes for the Treatment Period will be generated by Allergan and 
implemented by the IWRS vendor (an electronic version will be stored on a secure server). The 
randomization list will identify each patient by randomiza tion number and include the patient’s 
corresponding treatment assignment. The medication code list will be supplied by  
 to the IWRS vendor.

Confidential  Page 54 of 118 In case of an emergency, the IWRS will be accessed to obtain the study drug assignment of a 
patient. Acc essing the IWRS for emergency unblinding should be done only in an emergency 
that necessitates identifying the study drug for the welfare of the patient , and only after 
unsuccessfully attempting to contact the Medical Monitor or designee. If the blind is broken, the 
study center will notify the Sponsor immediately. An explanation for breaking the blind will be 
recorded on the relevant eCRF. Breaking the blind  at the study center will disqualify the patient 
from further participation in the study (refer to S ection 6.3 for details regarding procedures and 
follow-up for patients who are discontinued from therapy). 
7.7 CONCOMITANT MEDICINES  
A complete list of drugs that are conditionally allo wed and drugs that are not allowed as 
concomitant medicines for either episodic or chronic use is provided in Appendix 2. Throughout 
the study (Screening Period through Posttreatment Period), patients will be allowed to use 
loperamide to assist in managing their diarrhea . Loperamide 2- mg caplets  will be provided to the 
patient at study visits to use as needed (at the patient’s discretion) to manage their diarrhea 
throughout the study. Patient dosing of loperamide should not exceed 16 mg/day (8 unit doses), 
consistent with the product label. Beginn ing at the Pretreatment Visit (when the patients receive 
the eDiary)  through the Week 12/EOT Visit, the day and dose will be entered by the patient for 
each use of lopera mide on an event-driven basis. 
At the Screening Visit, all ongoing medicines or investigational products taken by the patient will be recorded.  Past use of certain  prescription medications (approved or unapproved) to 
manage IBS symptoms  (including alosetro n [Lotronex
®], rifaximin  [Xifaxan®], and eluxadoline 
[Viberzi®]), even if not ongoing at the time of the Screening Visit, will be recorded  at the 
Screening Visit .

before the Pretreatment Visit (or during the 3 months before the Pretreatment Vis it for 
rifaximin). OTC  medications  used to treat IBS -D, other than loperamide, may not be used during 
the study ( from the time of the Screening Visit through the EOS Follow-up Phone Call ). Other 
prohibited medicines may not be used during the Pretreatment, Treatment , and Posttreatment 
Periods, and may not be used during some or all of the Screening Period (refer to Appendix 2). 
Any chan ges in concomitant medicines or new medicines added after the Screening Visit will be 
recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medicines will be recorded at study visits throughout the entire study. Use of loperamide for diarrhea will be documented by the patient via eDiary.  
7.8 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
Study drug will be administered to the patient by study center staff at the Randomization Visit. For all other days i n the Treatment Period , study drug will be taken by the patient once daily at 
approximately the same time of day without regard to food. 
Study drug accountability  will be closely monitored during the Treatment Period by counting the 
number of tablets  returned and recording that information on the eCRF. Every effort will be 
made t o collect all unused study drug. Additionally, patients will be asked about the number of 
tablets  lost and that information will be r ecorded o n the eCRF .

8.1.3 Exploratory Assessments 
In addition to the key/additional efficacy assessments, the following non- efficacy exploratory 
assessments are used in determining the exploratory endpoints. 
Each day of the Pretreatment  and Treatment Periods, the patient will complete eDiary entries on 
an event -driven basis to report BMs. (The patient is also asked to provide assessments of stool 
consistency and  urgency, which are described below.) The patient will also complete eDiary 
entries on an event -driven basis to report use of loperamide for  diarrhea. Patients will complete a 
daily evening report to enter any BMs and  loperamide usage not previously reported by the 
patient for that day (recall is limited to 24 hours or to the time of the previous evening’s report). 
Bowel Movement  Frequency  
The assessment of BM frequency is based on the eDiary questions that record BM date and time. 
Patients will report BMs on an event-driven basis. An evening report will a sk whether the patient 
entered all BMs for that day, and collect BMs not previously entered for that day.

administered by the patient.  
Short Form- 12 Health Survey version 2 ( SF-12v2 ) 
The SF -12v2 is a widely used generic measure of health status ( Appendix 7).( 14) The SF -12v2 
measures 8 concepts commonly represented in widely used surveys: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), 
social functioning, role limitations due to emotio nal problems, and mental health (psychological 
distress and psychological well- being). These 8 scales are aggregated into 2 summary measures: 
the Physical and Mental Component Summary Scores. The SF-12v2 will be completed at the Randomization Visit prior to the patient receiving study drug and at subsequent visits as 
specified in the Schedule of Evaluations . At each of the designated visits, the assessment will be 
triggered by site personnel on the patient’s eDiary for the questionnaire to be self- administe red

The EQ -5D- 3L is a generic measure of health status that is widely used in Europe ( Appendix 
8).(15) The descriptive system consists of 5 questions assessing the following dimensions: 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Responses to the 
5 questions define a health state for which a utility index can be derived from published 
algorithms .(16) The second component of the EQ-5D- 3L is a visual analogue scale, asking 
patients to rate their health from 0 to 100 (0 represents worst imaginable health state and 100 represents best imaginable health state). The EQ -5D-3L will be completed at the Randomization 
Visit prior to the patient receiving study drug and at subsequent visits as specified in the Schedule of Evaluations . At each of the designated visits, the assessment will be triggered by site 
personnel on the patient’s eDiary for the questionnaire to be self-administered by the pat ient. 
Irritable Bowel Syndrome- Symptom Severity Scale ( IBS-SSS) 
The IBS -SSS contains 7 questions that ask patients to rate the severity and frequency of their 
abdominal pain and distention, dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and the extent to which the 
patient’s bowel habits interfere with life in genera l (Appendix 9).( 17) The IBS -SSS will be 
completed at the Randomization Visit prior to the patient receiving study drug and at subsequent visits a s specified in the Schedule of Evaluations . At each of the designated visits, the assessment 
will be triggered by site personnel on the patient’s eDiary for the questionnaire to be self-administered by the patient.  
8.1.5 Completion of eDiary Assessments  
To ensur e patient compliance with the completion of  the evening eDiary report, alarms occurring 
at 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 PM will be programmed to alert the patient that he/she has not completed 
the evening eDiary report. Upon completion of the evening eDiary report, the alarm will no 
longer be active for the remainder of that day. If the patient does not complete the evening report prior to midnight, that day’s evening report will no longer be available for reporting by the 
patient and all evening assessments for that day will be considered missing. 
Patient compliance with the  daily  eDiary completion requirement will be ve rified by site staff as

8.2.1.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug- related.  
An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Note:  A procedure is not an AE, but the reason for a procedure ma y be an AE.  
Serious Adverse Event 
An AE is considered “serious”  if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening  experience: An AE is considered "life- threatening" if, in the view of either 
the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization: AEs requiring 
hospital admissions that are less than 24 hours in duration do not meet this criterion. A 
scheduled hospitalization for a preexisting condition that has not worsened during 
participation in the study does not meet this criterion. Preplanned hospitalizations for an elective medical /surgical procedure or routine check-ups do not meet this criterion.

Confidential  Page 66 of 118 • Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly or  birth defect  
• Is considered to be an  important medical event : Important medical events  that may not result 
in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardiz e the patient and may require 
medical o r surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event 
A TEAE is an event that emerges, or a preexisting event that worsens, any time after 
administratio n of the first dose of study drug (Day 1). 
8.2.1.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
8.2.1.2.1 Severity  
The investigator or delegated physician will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by recording a severity rating in the patient’s source documentation and on the AE page  of the 
patient’s eCRF. Sev erity, which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is 
distinct from seriousness, which implies a patient outcome or AE- required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality. Severity will be assessed according to the 
following scale:  
Mild : A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually a lleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participa nt. 
MD-7246 Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: MCP -103-205 Amendment 1  29 Janua ry 2019 
 
Confidential  Page 67 of 118 Severe: A type of AE that interrupt s usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
AEs should be recorded using the maximum intensity of the event (eg, if a patient  reported 
nausea lasting 3 days, 1 start date and 1 stop date should be recorded along with the maximum 
intensity experienced for that event over that 3- day timeframe).  
8.2.1.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug 
For all AEs, the investigator must provide an assessment of causal relationship to study drug. The investigator must assess the relationship of each AE (including SAEs) to the use of a study 
drug using a 2-category scale (not related or related) based on clinical judgment and using all 
available information, and may include consideration of the following facto rs: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, preexisting 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic factors 
• The temporal association between drug exposure and onset of the AE 
• Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the 
investigational product 
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with stopping use of the study drug; judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the sa me time  
 
The causality assessment must be recorded in the patient’s source documentation and on the AE 
page of the patient’s eCRF. The c ausal relationship between study drug and the AE will be 
assesse d using the categories shown in Table 1.

Confidential  Page 68 of 118 Table 1. Adverse Event Causality  
Category  Definition  
Not related  An AE is not associated with study medication if:  
- Lack of a temporal relationship to study drug administration makes a 
causal relationship improbable (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable time frame following administration of the study medication); and/or 
- Other causative factor(s) (eg, a preexisting clinical condition, other 
concomitant treatments) more likely explain the occurrence of the 
event, and 
- The event did not improve with stopping of the investigational product, and/or 
- The event did not recur upon re-exposure with investigational product 
Related  An AE is attributed to the study medication if:  
- A temporal relationship to study drug administration makes a causal relationship plausible (eg, the event occurred within a reasonable time frame following administration of study medication); and/or  
- Other causative factor(s) (eg, the patien t’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant tr eatments) either do not explain the event or are less 
equally likely to have led to the occurrence of the event, or 
- The event improved with stopping of the investigational product, and/or 
- The event recurred upon re-exposure with investigational product 
 
8.2.1.2.3 Laboratory  and Vital Sign  Abnormalities  
The investigator will review clinical laboratory and vital sign  values for sig nificance and 
consideration as an AE. An abnormality should be captured as an AE if it meets any of the 
following criteria : 
• Meets criteria for an SAE  
• Results in discontinuation  or temporary dose suspension 
• Requires the patient  to receive specific correctiv e therapy  
• Is considered by the investigator to be clinically significant

Clinical Study Protocol: MCP -103-205 Amendment 1  29 Janua ry 2019 
 
Confidential  Page 69 of 118 Ongoing abnormal laboratory /vital sign  values  or conditions that are being treated at baseline 
will be captured as an AE if the condition increases in severity and/or frequency during the 
course of the study or if the condition requires more frequent treatment. If a patient  is treated for 
an abnormal laboratory /vital sign  value just before the Screening Visit, then the medical history 
should reflect the severity of the condition before treatment. 
8.2.1.3 Procedures for Recording  Adverse Event s 
The investigator will record all AEs from the time informed consent is  obtained until completion 
of study participation (eg, early termination or EOS Follow-up Phone Call). At each study visit, 
the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AEs/SAEs  since the last  visit.  
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of stu dy center  personnel during 
study visits and interviews of a study patient  presenting for medical care, or upon review by a 
site monitor. All AEs including SAEs will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. Information to 
be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study drug  (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a 
diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on stud y 
must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All SAEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution or stabilization for up to a maximum of 30 days after last dose. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the patient is screened and does not 
deteriorate (worsen in severity and/or frequency) should be recorded as Medical History and not 
as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study , it will be 
recorded as an AE.  AEs characterized as intermi ttent require documentation of onset and 
duration of each episode. 
Pretreatment AEs will be collected and captured in the patient’s  source documentation from the 
time the patient  signs the ICF until the patient  receives study drug. Pretreatment AEs in 
randomized patients  will additionally be entered on the AE page of the patient ’s eCRF.  
Laboratory abnormalities, changes in vital signs, and physical examination findings should be 
considered AEs and reported on the AE page of the patient's eCRF only if the in vestigator 
consi ders them  clinically significant and/or they necessitate intervention.

Confidential  Page 70 of 118 8.2.1.4 Procedures for Collecting and Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator or designee is to report any SAE to PPD  within 24 hours of becoming aware of 
the event  that occurred duri ng the reporting period. 
All SAEs will be submitted within  the EDC system. The system will prompt the Investigator or 
designee to provide as much information as possible, including the following: 
• SAE term  
• Serious criteria  
• Severity  
• Causality assessment  
• Action taken with study drug 
• Narrative explaining the context of the SAE outcome 
 
If all SAE information is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up SAE reports will 
be completed and submitted within the same reporting timelines as initial re ports using the EDC 
system . If the EDC  system is not available, the i nvestigator or designee will complete the hard -
copy SAE form, including all of the required information noted above. The completed form 
should then be provided to PPD using the contact information below: 
 
 
 
 
The investigator or designee should receive email confirmation from PPD that the SAE 
information was received within 24 hours after its submission (whether submitted via EDC or 
hard-copy form). In the event this receipt confirmation is not received, the investigator or 
designee will alert PPD.  
The investigator or designee is required to follow SAEs until resolution or stabilization for up to 
a maximum of 30 days after last dose. Resolution is defined as: 
• Resolved with or without residual effects (sequelae)

Confidential  Page 71 of 118 • A return to baseline for a preexisting condition 
• The investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event 
• Fatal outcome: If an autopsy is performed on a deceased patient , the autopsy report and death 
certificate must be provided to PPD as soon as it is available.  
 
8.2.1.4.1 Reporting of SAEs to the IRB 
The investigator will receive prompt notification of SAEs, with  the use of the study product, that 
are both unexpected and related, or any finding that suggests a significant risk for patients. The 
investigator will promptly inform the IRB of the notification and insert the notification in the 
Investigator’s Regulatory Binder in accordance with local regulations. 
All applicable expedited safety reports will be forwarded, by Ironwood, to the investigator. 
The investigator will inform Ironwood of any local regulatory or IRB requirements not covered 
by the procedures in this or the prior section. 
8.2.1.4.2 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any female patient  who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be withdrawn 
from the study. 
Information on any pregnancies in female patients, or the female partner of a male patient , will 
be collected  from the Screening Visit until the co mpletion of the EO S Follow-up Phone Call. 
If the patient  or the female partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant after receiving study drug 
during the course of study, the investigator will collect and record the pregnancy information on 
the Pregnancy Rep orting Form and submit it to PPD  within 24 hours of learning of the 
pregnancy. (Note: If the female partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant, the investigator must 
attempt to obtain consent to collect pregnancy information [including status of the newborn, if 
applicable] before reporting information to Ironwood). If not all information on the Pregnancy 
Reporting Form is available at the time of the initial report, follow -up Pregnancy Reporting 
Forms will be completed and submitted within 24 hours of becoming aware of new information. 
MD-7246 Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Confidential  Page 72 of 118 The investigator is required to attempt follow -up on the pregnancy until the completion of the 
pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and newborn will be forwarded to PPD 
within 24 hours of the investigator becomin g aware. Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 
6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  
While pregnancy itse lf is not considered to be an AE, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be an SAE and reported as such. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. 
Furthermore,  any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy and considered reasonably 
related to the investigational product by the in vestigator, will be reported to PPD  using the hard-
copy SAE form as described in Section 8.2.1.4. While the investigator is not obligated to actively 
seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting. 
8.2.2 Clinical Laboratory Determinations 
See below for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and refer to the Schedule of 
Evaluations  for the timing and frequency. All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as 
defined below, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the Schedule of Evaluations . 
The tests detailed below will be performed  (additional tests may be performed at any time during 
the study as determined necessary  by the investigator or as required by local regulations): 
• Hematology: Absolute and differential white blood cell count, erythrocyte count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and red blood cell indices (mean 
corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration)  
• Chemistry : Sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, chloride, glucose, blood urea 
nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bicarbonate, phosphate, cholesterol , and uric acid  
MD-7246 Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: MCP -103-205 Amendment 1  29 Janua ry 2019 
 
Confidential  Page 73 of 118 • Other: Urine drug screening (cocaine, barbiturates, amphetamines, opiates, 
benzodiazepine, alcohol, and cannabinoids) (Screening Visit only). By 
definition , a positive drug screen (including testing  positive for marijuana 
in states where marijuana is legalized) is clinically  significan t and, 
therefore, exclusionary.  
• Pregnancy  test: Serum human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test (for women of 
childbearing potential only) should be conducte d at the Screening Visit 
and Week 1 2/EOT Visit . A negative urine pregnancy test must be 
documented at the Randomization Visit for women of childbearing potential to be eligible for randomization and dosing with study drug. Positive results on the pregnancy test will exclude a patient from participating or continuing in the study. 
 
The investigator must review each  laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with  the source documents. All laboratory tests with abnormal 
values considered clinically significant during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the 
investigator or Medical Monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period 
of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor 
notified. If laboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory require a change in patient  management or are considered 
clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or study drug discontinuation), the 
results must be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Evaluations . Oral 
temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) will be 
assessed  with the patient in a seated position . BP and pulse measurements will be assessed with a 
completely automated device; manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available.  
BP and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the patient  in a 
quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones).

Confidential  Page 74 of 118 8.2.4 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Evaluations , 
by the investigat or or a licensed health professional listed on Form FDA 1572. Any physical 
examination abnormality that the investigator considers to be potentially clinically significant 
and changed from the baseline will be reported as an AE. A comple te physical examination will 
include, at a minimum, assessment of the general appearance of the patient and the HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat), cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, 
neurological, and dermatological systems. H eight  (only at scre ening) and weight will also be 
measured and recorded. 
Rectal examination s should be performed at the discretion of the investigator; the purpose of the 
rectal examination is to rule out pathologies that might be caused by obstruction . For all physical 
exam inations, the breast and genitourinary examinations are not required. 
8.2.5 Medical History  
A complete medical history , including disease- specific history,  will be provided by the patient at 
the Screening Visit.  
As part of the ir disease- specific history, patients will be asked about any prior IBS diagnosis. 
Patients will be enrolled based on the Rome IV criteria for IBS -D, as detailed in Section 6.1 and 
described below . 
Patient reports rec urrent abdominal pain, on average at least 1 day/week during the 3 months 
before the diagnosis, with the onset at least 6 months before the diagnosis, associated with 2 or 
more of the following features: 
a. Related to defecation  
b. Associated with a change in fr equency of stool 
c. Associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool

days with at least 1 abnormal BM . 
8.2.6 Required Investigator Consultation with the  Patient  
Patients will be allowed use of loperamide on an as -needed basis to  control their diarrhea. 
Throughout the Pretreatment and Treatment Period s, the eDiary will send automa ted alert s to the 
investigator if patients experience constipation  with excessive use of loperamide or diarrhea  that 
is not well managed with the use of loperamide , as described below . 
If a patient reports no BMs for ≥ 3 consecutive days with daily use of loperamide, the investigator 
must review the use of loperamide and pattern of constipation with the patient. An unscheduled 
visit to further evaluate the patient should be arranged if deemed necessary  by the i nvestigat or. 
The decision to continue, interrupt, or permanently discontinue study drug will be left to the discretion of the investigator on a patient- by-patient basi s. 
If the eDiary alert indicates that a patient  took ≥ 8 unit doses ( ≥16 mg) of loperamide in a 24-hour 
period for ≥ 5 consecutive days , the investigator must review the use of loperamide and pattern of 
diarrhea with the patient. An unscheduled visit to further evaluate the patient should be arranged if deemed necessary  by the investigator. The decision to continue, interrupt, or permanently 
discontinue study drug due to excessive use of loperamide will be left to the discretion of the investigator on a patient- by-patient basis.

9.1 DATA MONITORING  
Before any patient enters the study, a representative of Ironwood or its authorized designee will 
meet with the investigator a nd his/her staff to review the procedures to be followed while 
conducting the study and to train them on recording the data on the eCRFs using the electronic data captu re (EDC) system.  
After the first patient signs the ICF, the Ironwood representative, a s ite monitor, will periodically 
monitor the progress of the study by conducting monitoring visits. This site monitor will also be 
able to review the status of data queri es remotely, possibly warranting more frequent 
communication with the investigator and his/her staff. The investigator and his/her staff will be 
responsible for reviewing eCRFs, resolving data queries generated by the site monitor via the 
system, providing missing or corrected data, approving all changes performed on his/her data, 
and endorsi ng the patient data within the EDC system. This approval method will include 
applying an electronic signature, which is a uniquely assigned username and password that together will represent a traditional handwritten signature. 
9.2 DATA RE CORDING AND DOCUMENT ATION  
All data collected in the context of this study will be stored and evaluated in such a way as to 
guarantee patient confidentiality in accordance with the legal stipulations applying to 
confidentiality of data. Study records (eg, essential documents [commonly called regulatory 
documents], correspondence) will be retained at the study center, along with adequate source 
documentation, according to FDA and ICH requireme nts. All study records must be available for 
inspection by Ironwood, its authorized designee, and the FDA.

SAMPLE SIZE  
10.1 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
10.1.1 Screened Population  
The Screened Population consists of all patients who had a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and were 
assigned a PID number. 
10.1.2 Intent -to-Treat Population  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population consists of all randomized patients. 
10.1.3 Safety Population 
The Safety Population consists of all patients who received at least one dose of stu dy drug. 
10.2 GENERAL METHODS  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT Population for all outcomes reported during the 
Treatment Period using treatmen t group assigned at the Randomization Visit. Unless otherwise 
specified, all conf idence intervals (CIs) will be 2 -sided and with a confidence level of 95%. No 
adjustments will be made for multiplicity in the conduct of comparisons among the MD -7246 
doses r elative to placebo for the key efficacy endpoints, or in the analysis of the addi tional 
efficacy endpoints or exploratory endpoints. Safety analyses will be performed using descriptive 
summaries  based on the Safety Population and on actual treatment received. 
For analysis of continuous parameters (eg, change from baseline), descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD] , median, and range) will be calculated and presented for each treatment 
group. For categorical parameters (eg, responder vs. non-responder), the number and percentage of each category will be calculated and presented for each treatment group. Percentages will be 
based on the total number of non- missing values; the number missing will be presented, but 
without a percentage.

Screen failures (ie, patients who entered the Screening Period but not the Pretreatment Period) 
and pretreatment failures (ie, patients who entered the Pretreatment Period but were not 
randomized) and reason for failure will be tabulated . 
Patien t counts for the ITT Population will be provided by study center  and geographic region.  
Descriptive summaries will be presented for the ITT P opulation, the Safety  Population, for those 
who completed the Treatment Period  and for those who prematurely discon tinued during the 
Treatment Period , along with  the reason for prematu re discontinuation as recorded on the study 
completion form. Additionally, similar  summaries will be provided for those who completed the 
study (ie, completed the Treatment Period and 2-w eek Posttreatment Period)  and for those who 
discontinued prior to com pleting the study . 
10.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic parameters (age, age group, race, ethnicity, sex) , and baseline characteris tics 
(weight; height; and body mass index, calculated as weight in kg/ [height in m])2) will be 
summarized descriptively  for the Safety and ITT P opulations. Baseline efficacy and bowel 
parameters (including  abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, abdominal 
cramping,  BM frequency, urgent BM frequency, BSFS sco re, stool consistency) will be 
summarized descriptively for the ITT P opulation. 
10.2.3 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations and Important Protocol Deviations (IPD) will be identified and documented 
for all ITT patients prior to unblinding. IPDs will be determined based on blinded review of all 
protocol deviations and protocol deviation categories. IPD categories include, but are not limited 
to: 
• Those who entered the study even though they did not sat isfy the entry criteria  
• Those who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not withdrawn 
• Those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose 
• Those who received an excluded concomitant treatment

Prior and concomitant medicines will be classified using the most current version of the WHO 
Drug Dictionary available at the start of the study (or newer).  
Prior medicines are defined as any medicines taken prior to the date of first dose of study drug. Concomitant medicines are defined as any medicines taken on or after the date of first dose of 
study drug during the Treatment  Period . Posttreatment medicines  are defined as any medicines 
started  after the date of last dose of study drug for the Treatment  Period . 
Both prior and concomitant  medicine use, classified by therapeutic class,  will be summarized  by 
treatment group for the ITT Population. Multiple medic ines used by a patient in the same 
category (based on Anatomical -Therapeutic- Chemical classification) will be  counted only once. 
Posttreatment medicines will be presented in data listings.  
10.3 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE A ND TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
10.3.1 Exposure to Study Drug  
Exposure to study drug, calculated as the number of days from the date of first dose taken to the 
date of last dose taken,  will be summarized by treatment group for the Safety Population. 
10.3.2 Measurement of Treatment Compliance  
Dosing compliance for a specified period  is defined as the total number of tablets  actually taken 
by a patient during that period  divided by the number of tablets  that were expected to be taken 
during the same period , multiplied by 100. The total number of tablets  actually taken will be 
calculated based on the following equation: total number of tablets  dispensed – (number of 
tablets  returned + number of tablets  lost) . The total number of tablets  expected to be taken during 
a specified period  equals the number of days in the period, multiplied by  4. 
Descriptive statistics for study drug compliance  for the Treatment Period o verall, and for each o f 
the 3 consecutive 4 -week periods in  the Treatment Period (consistent with study drug 
dispensing) will be pr esented  for the Safety Population.

Confidential  Page 81 of 118 10.3.3 eDiary Compliance  
eDiary compliance will be based on the percentage of complete eDiary entries made by a patient . 
A complete eDiary entry is defined as one in which the patient responds to every eDiary question 
asked in the evening report on that day. The questions that are asked weekly will not be included 
in the determination of a complete entry.  The percentage of  complete eDiary entries will be 
calculated as 100 times  the number of completed evening reports divided by the total number of 
days in the study period (Pretreatment and  Treatment).  
Descriptive statistics for eDiary compliance  (%) and the patients with ≥8 0%/<80% complete 
eDiary entries durin g the Pretreatment  and Treatment  Period s will be presented . 
10.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
All efficacy analyses to address the objectives of the study will be based on the ITT Population. Exploratory analyses  to address the exploratory objective of the study also will be based on the 
ITT Population. 
Baseline values for efficacy and exploratory parameters are derived from the eDiary and eCRF 
data collected in the Pretreatment Period, specifically, the period of time from 14 days prio r to 
randomization up to the time of randomization. Baseline values for patient symptom severity 
parameters (eg, abdominal symptoms [pain, bloating, discomfort , cramping ]) will be the average 
of the non-missing severity scores reported during this period. The baseline BM and urgent BM 
weekly rates will be derived based on the number of BMs and urgent BMs a patient had during 
this period. Baseline BSFS score  and stool consistency will be calculated as the average of the

10.4.1 Key Efficacy  Endpoint s 
The 2 key efficacy endpoints are: 
• Change from Baseline in Abdominal Pain at its Worst at Each Week 
The weekly abdominal pain at its worst score is the average of the non -missing abdominal 
pain scores during each week (Weeks 1 -12) in the study. The baseline abdominal pain score 
is the avera ge of the non-missing abdominal pain scores during the last 14 day s of the  
Pretreatment Period and the day of the Randomization Visit reported prior to randomization. 
Change from baseline will be calculated for each week as the weekly score minus the baseline score.  
• 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain 30% Responder 
A 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain 30% Responder is a patient who meets the Weekly Abdominal 
Pain 30% Responder criteria for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. A Weekl y Abdominal Pain 30% Responder is a patient who has a decrease from baseline of at 
least 30% in the mean abdominal pain at its worst score for that week. If a patient did not enter information into the eDiary on at least 4 days for a particular Treatment P eriod week, 
the patie nt will not be considered a Weekly Abdominal Pain 30% Responder for that week. 
 
10.4.2 Key Efficacy Analysis 
Comparisons between the MD -7246 dose groups and placebo with regard to the change from 
baseline in abdominal pain over the Treatment Period will be evalua ted employing a MMRM 
framework with week (categorical), treatment, geographic region, and week- by-treatment fixed 
effects, patient as the random effect, and baseline value as a covariate. An unstructured 
covariance structure will be ut ilized. Descriptive s tatistics , for the overall Treatment Period 
effect,  based on the MMRM model will include least- squares (LS) mean change from baseline 
for each treatment, the LS mean difference between each MD -7246 dose and placebo, 
corresponding 95% CIs, and the p- value associated with the comparison. In addition, weekly 
treatment differences between each MD -7246 group and placebo will be provided using the same 
MMRM model defined above.

each MD -7246 group will be compared to the proportion of responders in the placebo group 
using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for geographic region. The number 
and percent of responders, the difference in responder rates  between each MD-7246 group and 
the placebo group, the odds ratio relative to placebo, all corresponding 95% CIs, and the p- value 
associated with the CMH test will be presented.  
10.4.3 Additional  Efficacy Endpoint s 
The additional  efficacy endpoint s are: 
• 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain 50% Responder 
A 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain 50% Responder is a patient who meets the Weekly Abdominal 
Pain 50% Responder criteria for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. For each week in th e Treatment Period, a Weekly Abdominal Pain 50% Responder is a patient 
who has a decrease from baseline of at least 50% in the mean abdominal pain at its worst score for that week. If a patient did not enter information into the eDiary on at least 4 days for a particular Treatment Period week, the patient will not be considered a Weekly 
Abdominal Pain 50% Responder for that week. 
• 6/12 Week Abdominal Discomfort 30% Responder 
A 6/12 Week Abdominal Discomfort 30% Responder is a patient who meets the Weekly 
Abdominal Discomfort 30% Responder criteria for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. The Weekly Abdominal Discomfort 30% Responder criteria are defined the same as the Weekly Abdominal Pain 30% Responder criteria above. 
• 6/12 Week Abdomina l Bloating 30% Responder 
A 6/12 Week Abdominal Bloating 30% Responder is a patient who meets the Weekly Abdominal Bloating 30% Responder criteria for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. The Weekly Abdominal Bloating 30% Responder criter ia are defined the 
same as the Weekly Abdominal Pain 30% Responder criteria above.  
• 6/12 Week Abdominal Cramping 30% Responder 
A 6/12 Week Abdominal Cramping 30% Responder is a patient who meets the Weekly 
Abdominal Cramping 30% Responder criteria for at le ast 6 out of the 12 weeks of the 
Treatment Period. The Weekly Abdominal Cramping 30% Responder criteria are defined the same as the Weekly Abdominal Pain 30% Responder criteria above.

A 6/12 Week Degree of Relief Responder is a patient who scores ≤2 (“completely” or 
“considerably” relieved) for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. 
• 6/12 Week Adequate Relief of IBS Pain Responder 
A 6/12 Week Adequate Relief of IBS Pain Responder is a patient who re ports adequate relief 
of IBS pain (“yes”) for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. 
• Treatment Satisfaction  
For each week of the Treatment Period, patients will rate their satisfaction with the study 
medication’s ability to relieve their I BS sym ptoms on a 5-point ordinal scale. 
• Change from Baseline in Percent of Abdominal Pain- free Days at Each Week  
Abdominal pain is measured daily using an 11-point NRS. Abdominal pain- free days will be 
those days where the patient reports a score of 0 for abdomi nal pain at its worst. The percent 
of abdominal pain- free days will be calculated as the number of Abdominal Pain- free Days 
during a particular week, divided by the total number of days with non- missing daily 
abdominal pain at its w orst assessments for tha t week, multiplied by 100. Due to the potential 
of this data to not meet parametric normality assumptions, the baseline percent abdominal pain-free days and change from baseline in percent abdominal pain -free days will be ranked 
first, respectively, and then transformed to the expected values of the order statistics of the 
standard normal distribution (ie, normal scores). 
• Change from Baseline in Abdominal Discomfort at its Worst at Each Week  
Abdominal discomfort is measured daily using an 11-point NRS. For each week on treatment, the weekly abdominal discomfort score is the mean of the non- missing daily 
values.  
• Change from Baseline in Abdominal Bloating at its Worst at Each Week  
Abdominal bloating is measured daily using an 11-point NRS. For each week on tre atment, 
the weekly abdominal bloating score is the mean of the non- missing daily values.  
• Change from Baseline in Abdominal Cramping at its Worst at Each Week  
Abdominal cramping is measured daily using an 11 -point NRS. For each week on treatment, 
the weekly  abdominal cramping  score is the mean of the non -missing daily values.

The additional categorical responder (eg, 6/12 Week Abdominal Bloating 30% Responder) and 
continuous change- from -baseline endpoints will be analyzed utiliz ing the same methods defined 
for the key efficacy endpoints in Section 10.4.2. Treatment Satisfaction will be analyzed utilizing an MMRM framework with week (categorical), treatment, geographic region, and week -by-
treatment fixed effects, and patient as the random effect . An unstructured covariance structure 
will be utilized. Pairwise comparisons between each treatment group and placebo will be 
performed for the overall Treatment Period effect . MMRM- associated st atistics, as defined in 
Section 10.4.2 for the key efficacy change- from-baseline endpoint, will be presented.  
10.4.5 Exploratory Endpoints  
Exploratory endpoints related to bowel function will be studied to address the exploratory 
objective of the study. These non- efficacy endpoints will include: 
• Change from Baseline in BM Frequency Rate at Each Week  
A patient’s weekly BM frequency rate is the BM rate (BMs/week) calculated for that week.  
• Change from Baseline in BSFS (Sto ol Consistency) at Each Week  
Stool consistency is measured using the 7-point BSFS. The patient’s BSFS scor e for each 
week on treatment is the mean of the non-missing BSFS scores from the BMs reported by the 
patient during the week. 
• Change from Baseline in Urgent BM Frequency Rate at Each Week  
An urgent BM is a BM that is associated with urgency (ie, the need t o rush to the toilet to 
avoid an accident). A patient’s weekly urgent BM frequency rate is the urgent BM rate 
(urgent BMs/week) calculated for that week.

Confidential  Page 86 of 118 • Change from Baseline in the Percent of Days Experiencing an Episode of Diarrhea per Week  
An episode of diarrhea is defined as a sequence of 2 or more loose/watery BMs (BSFS 6 or 
7) that are never separated by >1 non -loose/watery stool or by a day witho ut a BM. The 
Treatment Period percent of days experiencing an episode of diarrhea will be calculated as 100 times the number of days with a diarrhea episode at each week divided by 7. For baseline, the number of days with a diarrhea episode will be determi ned for the last 14 day s 
of the Pretreatment Period. The baseline percent of days experiencing an episode of diarrhea will be calculated as 100 times the number of days experiencing an episode during the 
baseline period divided by the length in days of the baseline period (typically 14 days). The 
change from baseline will be calculated for each week as the weekly percent minus the baseline percent . 
• Change from Baseline in the Percent of Days Experiencing No  Episodes of Diarrhea per 
Week  
Episodes of diarrhea are described above. The percent of days experiencing no episodes of 
diarrhea per week will be calculated using the same method as described above for episodes of diarrhea.  
• Change from Baseline in BM -related Symptom Severity at Each Week  
BM-related Symptom severity is measured week ly using a 5 -point ordinal scale comparing 
the severity for the past 7 days.  
• BM-related Symptom Change 
BM-related symptom change is measured weekly using a 7-point ordinal scale comparing the 
severity for the past 7 days to the s everity before starting the study . 
• Change from Baseline in Percent of Days with Use of Loperamide for Diarrhea at Each 
Week  
The percent of days using loperamide for diarrhea at each week will be calculated as 100 
times  the number of days loperamide was used during the week divided by 7.

Patient responses to the descriptive system (i.e., health state) will be converted to the 
corresponding utility score and the descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum and 
maximum) will be presented for utility index score by treatment group. The same statistics will 
be calculated for the visual analog scale of patient’s health rating. Results will be presented for 
each visit . 
10.5.4 IBS-SSS 
The IBS -SSS parameters cons ist of 5 individual items and the IBS- SSS total score. The 
5 individual items ( severit y of abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, severity of 
abdominal distension, dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and interference of IBS with life in general ) are based on a 0 -100 scale (10 times the original scale) and the IBS -SSS total score 
parameter is the sum of the 5 IBS-SSS individual item scores (0 -500 scale).  
For each post-baseline visit, change from baseline in the IBS- SSS total score and individual 
items w ill be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with fixed effect terms for treatment group and 
geographic region and the corresponding baseline IBS- SSS score as a covariate.  
10.6 SAFETY  ANALYSES  
All safety parameters will be analyzed descriptively in accordance with the general methods described in Section 10.2 . 
10.6.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse Event Verbatim Terms will be coded in the EDC system against the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ) available at the start of 
the study (or newer). 
An AE that occurs during the Treatment Period (up to 1 day after the last dose of double-blind 
study drug) will be considered a TEAE for the Treatment Period if it was not present prior to the 
date of the first dose of double-blind study drug, or was present prior to the date of the first dose 
but increased in severity during the Treatment Period.

Confidential  Page 89 of 118 If more than one AE is reported prior to the first dose of double-blind study drug and coded to 
the same preferred term, the AE with the greatest severity will be used as the benchmark for 
comparison with the AEs occurring during the Treatment Period that were also coded to that 
preferred term. An AE that occurs more than 1 day after t he last dose of double-blind study drug 
will not be counted as a TEAE. 
For the Treatment  Period , the number and percentage of patients reporting TEAEs in each 
treatment group will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term; by SOC, 
preferred term, and severity; and by SOC, preferred term, and relationship to study drug. If a 
patient has more than one TEAE coded to the same preferred term, the patient will be counted 
only once for that preferred term by identifying those TEAEs with the highe st severity and the 
closest relationship to study drug.  
The distribution of TEAEs by severity and relationship to study drug will be summarized by 
treatment group for the Treatment Period.  
The incidence of common TEAEs, on- therapy SAEs, and AEs leading to  premature 
discontinuation of study drug will be summarized by preferred term and treatment group for the 
Treatment Period. In addition, the incidence of fatal SAEs (ie, events with an outcome of death), 
if any, will be summarized separately by treatment g roup and pref erred term for the Treatment 
Period. 
Listings will be presented for patients with SAEs, patients with AEs leading to discontinuation, 
and patients who died (if any).  
10.6.2 Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory  values (in s tandard units) and changes from the 
baseline values at each assessment time point will be presented by treatment group for the 
Treatment Period , for each clinical laboratory parameter.

Confidential  Page 90 of 118 The number and percentage of patients with potentially cli nically significant (PCS) post- baseline 
clinical laboratory values will be tabulated  by treatment group  for the Treatment Period. The 
criteria for PCS laboratory values will be detailed in the SAP. The percentages will be calculated 
relative to the numb er of patients with available non -PCS baseline values and at least 1 
assessment in the corresponding post-baseline period. The numerator will be the total number of patients with available non -PCS baseline values and at least 1 PCS value in the correspondi ng 
post-baseline period. A supportive listing of patients with PCS post- baseline values will be 
provided, including the PID number, study center, and baseline and post- baseline values. A 
listing of all AEs for patients with PCS laboratory values will also be provided. 
10.6.3 Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital signs (ie, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic BP, respiratory rate, 
temperature, and body weight) and changes from baseline at each visit and at the end of the 
period/study will be presented by trea tment group for the Treatment Period.  
The number and percentage of patients with PCS post- baseline vital signs will be tabulated by 
treatment group for the Treatment Period. A vital sign value will be considered PCS if it meets 
both the observed value crit erion and the change from baseline value criterion. The criteria for 
PCS vital sign values will be detailed in the SAP. The percentages will be calculated relative to 
the number of patients with baseline values and at least 1 assessment in the correspondin g post-
baseline period. The numerator will be the total number of patients with available non- PCS 
baseline values and at least 1 PCS value in the corresponding post-baseline period. A supportive 
listing of patients with PCS post- baseline values will be pro vided, including the PID number, 
study center, and baseline and post -baseline values. A listing of all AEs for patients with PCS 
vital sign values will also be provided. 
10.7 INTERIM ANALYSIS  
An optional interim analysis of unblinded safety and efficacy data may be performed  to assess 
futility . If it is decided to perform such an interim futility analysis , details regarding the interim 
futility analysis (eg, alpha spending and statistical boundaries) will be included in the SAP, along

the mean change from baseline to Week 12 in abdominal pain, an SD  of 2.4, and 92 patients per 
treatment group (368 patien ts total), the estimated power is approximately 80 % to detect a 
difference between each MD-7246 dose and placebo at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using

GASTROENTEROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES 
1. Patients aged 50 years and older must have had a colonoscopy with negative findings 
during the 10 years before the Screening Visit. If there were polyps on the most recent colonoscopy, the patient may be enrolled, provided ther e were 2 or fewer small (<1  cm) 
tubular adenomas without appreciable villous tissue or high-grade dysplasia and provided the colonoscopy was performed during the 5 years before the Screening Visit. (Note: 
Patients who have only hyperplastic polyps are eligible.)  
2. Patients who have a first -degree relative with colorectal cancer o r adenomatous polyps 
diagnosed before age 60 or 2 first -degree relatives with colorectal cancer diagnosed at 
any age must have had a colonoscopy with negative findings during the 5 y ears before 
the Screening Visit. This applies to patients who are ≥40 year s old and to patients 
<40 years old who are ≤10 years from the age when their youngest relative was found to 
have one of the conditions described above. 
3. Patients who have a first -degree relative with colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps 
diagnosed at age 60 or older or 2 second- degree relatives with colorectal cancer 
diagnosed at any age must have had a colonoscopy with negative findings during the 10 years before the Screening Visi t. This applies to patients who are ≥40 years old and to 
patients <40 years old who are ≤10 years from the age when their youngest relative was found to have one of the conditions described above. 
4. Patients of any age who have alarm symptoms must have had a colonoscopy with negative findings after the onset of the alarm symptoms and during the 5 years before the 
Screening Visit. Alarm symptoms include lower GI bleeding (rectal bleeding or heme -
positive stool), iron- deficiency anemia, unexplained clinically -significant weight loss, 
and systemic signs of infection or colitis. In addition, patients with a family history of celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease must have had a colonoscopy with negative findings during the five years before the Screening Vi sit. 
 
Note: All information required by the Inclusion Criterion will be captured on the eCRFs. Patients 
who receive narcotic anesthesia for a colonoscopy are eligible to enter the Pretreatment Period 
only on the fifth day or later after the colonoscopy.

Confidential  Page 4 of 7 1. SUMMARY OF THE PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
The major changes from clinical  protocol MCP -103- 205 Original Protocol to MCP -103-205 
Protocol Amendment 1 are summarized below. 
The following changes were made to the protocol: 
• The i ndication was changed from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to abdominal pain in 
diarrhea -predominant IBS (IBS- D); constipation and mixed subtypes were removed from the 
study. 
- The study title, objectives , introduction, and other sections as described below, were 
updated to reflect this change.  
• The contact information for SAE reporting was changed from Ironwood to PPD 
(  
). 
• The Ro me IV questionnaire was removed for diagnosis and subtyping (Rome IV criteria are 
still used, as detailed in the inclusion criteria) .  
- Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire IBS Module was removed from the appendices. 
• Stratification by IBS subtype and minimum en rollment for each subtype were removed  from 
descriptions of randomization and enrollment. 
• The Pretreatment Period was shortened from 21-28 days to 14-21 days. 
- Timing of the Screening and Pretreatment Visits , and total duration of patient 
participation in the study, were  adjusted accordingly : Screening Visit ( Day -49 to 
Day -15), Pretreatment Visit (Day -21 to Day -14), and duration (up to 151 days). 
• The Week 2 and  Week 14/EOS  Visits were changed to phone calls collecting only adverse 
events (AEs) and concomitant medicines , and an eDiary compliance reminder was added at 
Week 2 . 
- Other assessments at these timepoints were removed: IWRS registration, body weight 
and height, vital signs , eDiary registration, patient eDiary entry in clinic, eDiary 
compliance verification  and reminder ( removed at EOS only), EQ -5D- 3L, and IBS -SSS 
- Because the last visit to the clinic will now be the Week 12/ End-of-Treatment ( EOT ) 
Visit, eDiary entry (including daily, weekly, and study visit assessments) was removed during the Posttreatment Period ; statistical analyses related to the Posttreatment Period 
were updated accordingly . 
- Details regarding the Week 2 and Week 14/EOS calls were added in the Schedule of Evaluation footnotes and in the descriptions of the study periods.

Summary of Changes for Protocol Amendment 1 : MCP -103-205 29 January 2019 
 
Confidential  Page 5 of 7 • Protocol- permitted over-the-counter ( OTC ) medications for constipation and diarrhea 
(MiraLAX® [polyethylene glycol 3350] , Ex-Lax® [sennosides], and Imodium® [loperamide ]) 
were changed to loperamide f or diarrhea to reflect the indication change to IBS -D only. 
- The assessment  of use of these medications on an event-driven basis, corresponding 
eDiary questions and exploratory endpoints, and concomitant and prohibited medicines 
were updated accordingly . 
• The Diary of IBS Symptoms – Mixed ( DIBSS -M) was changed to the D IBSS  – Diarrhea 
(DIBSS -D) for daily abdominal symptom and BM- related assessments, to reflect the 
indication change to IBS-D only. 
- Assessments of straining and completeness of evacuation (and corresponding eDiary 
questions and exploratory endpoints ) were removed  to reflect the components of the 
DIBSS -D. 
• The IBS -QOL and HADS were removed from the study visit assessments. 
- Corresponding statistical analyses and appendices were also rem oved. 
• The number of patient s was reduced  from approximately 400 IBS patients (approximately 
100 patients per treatment group) to approximately 368 IBS -D patients (approximately 
92 patients per treatment group) . 
- Sample size determination was updated to reflect this change.  
• Inclusion criteria were updated as follows:  
- #7 and 8 (related to Rome IV diagnosis and subtyping , respectively ) were updated to 
reflect the indication change to IBS-D only, by removing medications and criteria  
specific to IBS -C and IBS-M. 
- #11 was added to ensure patients are able to swallow the study drug whole , as study drug 
may not be chewed, divided, crushed, or dissolved. 
• Exclusion criteria were updated as follows: 
- #5-7 in the original protocol were consoli dated into #5-6 in the amended protocol 
- #12 was broadened to exclude patients with a history of a microbiologically documented 
lower GI infection , or received treatment for a microbiologically documented lower GI 
infection during the 3 months before Screening; Clostridium difficile colitis was given as  
an example of such an infection , rather than the only such infection excluded 
- #13 was updated to ex clude patients with a history of hypersensitivity to loperamide, in 
addition to linaclotide or any of the excipients in the study drug (MD-7246 or placebo) 
- #14b was updated to add details regarding laparoscopic surgery of the abdomen, pelvis, or retroperitoneal structures (excluded during the 3 months before Screening)

Confidential  Page 6 of 7 - #15 was updated to allow patients whose cancer had been complete remission for 3 years 
before Randomization (reduced from 5 years) 
- #17 was added to exclude patients with a history of human immunodeficiency virus infection  
- #20 was added to exclude patients with a history or current evidence of laxative or opiod abuse 
- #23 in the original protocol was removed because it was specific to IBS -C 
- Minor revisions for structure, clarity , and to reduce redundancy were made to #2, 9, and 
10 
• Efficacy and exploratory statistical analyses were updated to remove IBS subtype and 
treatment -by-IBS-subtype from fixed effects  and to remove by -subtype analyses . 
• The exploratory endpoints were updated to reflect the changes in indication  and protocol-
permitted OTC medications, and the change from DIBSS- M to DIBSS -D: 
- Removed Change from Baseline in Straining at Each Week and Change from B aseline in 
the Proportion of Days Experiencing an Episode of Constipation per Week 
- Remo ved constipation from Change from Baseline in the Proportion of Days 
Experiencing No Episodes or Constipation or Diarrhea per Week 
- Updated Change from Baseline in Percent of Da ys with Use of Protocol- permitted OTC 
Medications for Constipation and Diarrhea to reflect the change to Loperamide for 
Diarrhea  
• The rectal examination as part of the physical examination was changed to be at the discretion of the investigator, rather than required at Screening for all patients not requiring colonoscopy and not required at subsequent visits. 
• Overall study stopping criteria were updated to remove text related to stopping enrollm ent 
after the required number of patients have been enrolled (considered self- evident  based on 
target enrollment) and reference to IBS subtypes.  
• The rational e for study design was updated to reflect the study design changes described 
above, including the s hortened Pretreatment Period, removal of Posttreatment Period eDiary 
assessment, indication change to IBS-D only, removal of stratification by IBS subtype, and changes to protocol- permitted OTC medications.  
• Prohibited medicines were refined to be more spec ific to IBS -D and to clarify washout

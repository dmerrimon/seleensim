1 SYNOPSIS 
Study Title A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Finding 
Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of KD025 in Adult 
Subjects with Moderate to Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis who are 
Candidates for Systemic Therapy or Phototherapy 
Clinical Phase 2 
Number of Study Centers Up to 20 
Study Background Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects many parts of the body but 
is primarily manifested in the skin. It affects 2% to 3% of the population 
of the world, making it a very common inflammatory autoimmune disease. 
The most common form of psoriasis, called psoriasis vulgaris, accounts for 
over 80% of the people with psoriasis. This type of psoriasis appears as 
raised plaques of dry scaly skin that may affect multiple regions of the 
body. Psoriasis is graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the 
percentage of the body affected and the intensity of the inflammation. 
Several genetic loci have been associated with psoriasis and the major 
genetic determinant, psoriasis susceptibility, accounts for up to 50% of the 
hereditary aspects of the disease. This locus encodes several immune 
functions as well as epidermis-associated proteins that are expressed and 
up-regulated in psoriasis. The genetic basis of sensitivity to psoriasis is 
supported by the fact that there is 70% concordance in identical twins. 
The pathogenesis of psoriasis is not fully understood. However, it has 
been recognized that the recently discovered T helper 17 (Th17) cells, 
which represent highly proinflammatory cells that function in the 
induction of multiple autoimmune diseases as well as enhancing the 
clearance of extracellular pathogens, play a critical role in the pathogenesis 
of psoriasis. Th17 cells secrete interleukins IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, 
which can activate keratinocytes and endothelial cells in the skin. 
Antibodies directed against IL-17 have been approved by the United States 
(US) Regulatory Authorities. Secukinumab is a human 11-17A antagonist 
indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis 
in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 
It is administered subcutaneously and has demonstrated robust efficacy in 
4 well-controlled clinical studies. The primary endpoints for these 
4 studies were the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PAST) score of at least 75% (PAST 75) 
from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (clear or almost clear) on 
the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA; modified 2011). An increase of 
Kadmon Corporation 	Page 5 of 90 	12 Mar 2019

Protocol Number KDO25-211 
infections was reported, as well as a few exacerbations of Crohn's disease 
and hypersensitivity. 
Another subcutaneous agent, ustekinumab, has been approved for the same 
indication. Ustekinumab is a human IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients (18 years or older) with moderate to 
severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or 
systemic therapy. An increase of infections and a few cases of skin cancer 
were reported in 2 large placebo-controlled studies. 
One oral agent, apremilast (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4), has been 
approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic 
therapy. However, safety concerns such as depression, weight decrease, 
and issues with drug interactions due to a strong cytochrome P450 enzyme 
induction have been reported. Also, administration requires a titration at 
initiation due to gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. The efficacy at 16 
weeks was relatively less than that observed with secukinumab and 
usteldnumab. In 2 large controlled studies, efficacy results were PAST 75 
of 33.1% and 28.8% versus placebo 5.3% and 5.8%, with the static 
Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of "clear" or "almost clear" of 
21.7% and 20.4% versus placebo 3.9% and 4.4%. Apremilast is also 
approved for psoriatic arthritis. 
Several Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors have been studied for the therapy of 
psoriasis as well as other autoimmune diseases. However, none has been 
approved for the treatment of psoriasis to date. Tofacitinib is an inhibitor 
of Jak 3 with somewhat less activity against Jak 1 and Jak 2. It has been 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a twice daily 
(BID) oral medication for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and is 
marketed as XELJANZ ®, and has multiple severe infectious and 
immunologic side effects associated with therapy. Monotherapy with 
tofacitinib was associated with a modest increase in American College of 
Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) improvement criteria compared with 
placebo (57% versus 26%). Ruxolitinib is a Jak 1 and Jak 2 inhibitor that 
has been approved for myelofibrosis. It has also been associated with 
severe side effects including bone marrow suppression. Both of the above 
Jak inhibitors have undergone initial clinical testing in psoriasis, but the 
side effect profile of this class of inhibitors has been troublesome. 
Several studies have been perfolined with etanercept and adalimumab, 
both of which block tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and have 
demonstrated efficacy in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, but no 
therapy has been as effective as IL-17 blockade in the therapy of psoriasis.

A number of biologic products have been approved for the treatment of 
moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Interestingly, secukinumab, 
an IL-17 targeting agent, has shown robust efficacy with rapid onset. 
However, there are still safety concerns and most of these products are 
parenterally administered. Apremilast, which does not target IL-17, is an 
approved oral agent with an acceptable risk benefit. An oral agent such as 
KD025, which targets TL-17, could potentially provide an oral treatment 
option with an improved safety and efficacy profile. 
Study Rationale This proof-of-principle, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KD025 administered orally for 
16 weeks to subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who 
are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Data collected in this 
study will be used along with data from previous KD025 studies to further 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KD025. 
Recent studies with KD025 have demonstrated that this molecule has anti-
inflammatory activity mediated by the inhibition of secretion of IL-17 and 
IL-21 by Th17 cells. Since this pathway has emerged as a central 
inflammatory pathway in psoriasis, it is possible that an oral formulation 
(e.g., KD025) could offer significant advantages over other available oral 
formulations. This study will provide safety and efficacy data of the 
therapeutic response to evaluate the risk/benefit of treating plaque 
psoriasis with KD025.

9. 	Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy 
test at screening. Females of childbearing potential are defined as 
sexually mature women without prior hysterectomy or those who 
have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However, 
women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still 
considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is 
possibly due to prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, or ovarian 
suppression. 
• Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must 
have a negative urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be 
confirmed by serum test) documented within the 24-hour period 
prior to the first dose of study drug. 
• Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the 
study must agree to use 2 forms of accepted methods of 
contraception during the course of the study and for 3 months 
after their last dose of study drug. Effective birth control includes

doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, 
injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; 
(c) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or 
female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels 
that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized 
partner. 
10. For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of 
premenopausal women: agreement to use 2 forms of contraception, as 
in criterion 9, bullet 2c above, during the treatment period and for at 
least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

Duration of Treatment Up to 48 weeks of treatment: All subjects will receive blinded study drug 
(either KD025 or placebo) from randomization, for a total of 16 weeks. 
Subjects randomized to KD025 or placebo will have the option to continue 
400 mg of KD025 QD treatment for an additional 32 weeks in the open-
label treatment period. 
Concomitant Treatment Subjects will be counseled to avoid non-prescribed medicines or 
complementary alternative medicines excluded by the study. Any 
medications a subject receives from signing ICF through the end-of-study 
(30-Day Follow-Up visit) will be documented. 
Subjects may be receiving low-dose oral corticosteroids (< 10 mg daily 
prednisone or equivalent) at study entry. Oral corticosteroid dose must be

stable for at least 1 month prior to study entry and expected to remain 
stable throughout participation. Any changes in systemic corticosteroid 
dose will be documented on the electronic Case Report form (eCRF). 
Topical corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapies to the face, groin, 
or scalp are allowed. Prior systemic treatments, including biologics, are to 
be recorded on the eCRF, including duration of exposure and reason for 
discontinuation. 
Safety Evaluation Safety assessments will include AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), PEs 
(including weight), vital sign measurements (including blood pressure 
[BP], pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), clinical laboratory 
evaluations (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation, lipid panel, 
TSH), ECGs, and reasons for treatment discontinuation due to toxicity. 
The AE reporting period for a subject enrolled in the study begins when 
the subject signs the ICF and continues through 30 days after the last dose 
of study drug. All AEs that occur in enrolled subjects during the AE 
reporting period must be reported on subjects' eCRFs, regardless of the 
relationship of the AE to study drug. Any known untoward event that 
occurs beyond the AE reporting period that the investigator assesses as 
possibly related to study drug also should be reported to the sponsor. 
Subjects with ongoing AEs/SAEs will be followed until resolution or a 
new treatment is started. 
Efficacy Evaluation The primary efficacy endpoint for analysis will be the number (%) of 
subjects with a 75% decrease in PAST at Week 16. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for analysis will include the following: 
1. A 50% reduction in Week 16 PAST score (PAST 50) 
2. The mean Week 16 percent change from baseline in PAST 
3. Improvements in PGA of "clear" or "almost clear" at Week 16 
4. Improvements in DLQI at Week 16 
The exploratory efficacy endpoints are: 	 . 
• To evaluate the concentration and changes in IL-17 expression 
in blood, tissue, and other biomarkers in punch biopsy after 
16 weeks of dosing with KD025 
Efficacy analyses will be divided into 2 periods: the double-blind 
treatment period through database lock at Week 16, and the 32-week, 
open-label continuation period. 
Pharmacodynamics All subjects will have PD blood samples collected over the course of the 
study. Subjects who elect to continue therapy will also have PD blood 
Kadmon Corporation 	Page 13 of 90 	12 Mar 2019

KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
samples collected. For any subject who discontinues prematurely, blood 
for PD evaluation will also be collected at the Early-Termination visit. 
Samples will be evaluated for the expression of the psoriasis-associated 
cytokine, 1L-17, in plasma. 
Statistical Analysis Data Presentations/Descriptive Statistics 
The sample size will be 110 subjects due to early study termination. 
Two populations will be employed in the analysis of study data: 
• The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population will consist of 
all subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of 
study drug. All safety analyses will be performed on the mITT 
population. 
• The Evaluable for Efficacy population will consist of subjects 
who have non-missing baseline and Week 16 PAST scores and 
do not have a major protocol violation. 
Demographics, subject disposition, and screening and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized for mITT populations, where 
appropriate. 
Efficacy analyses will include the number (%) of subjects with a 75% 
decrease in PAST (number of subjects that reach PAST 75) at Week 16 in 
the KD025 treatment groups compared with the placebo group in a 
pairwise manner using a Fisher's exact test. The number of subjects who 
reach PAST 50 at Week 16 will be analyzed similarly. 
Treatment group differences in DLQI and PGA changes from baseline to 
Week 16 will be assessed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with treatment as a fixed effect and a subject's baseline value as a 
covariate. 
No adjustments for multiplicity are being made for this Phase 2 study. 
The primary safety endpoint will be the percentage of subjects in each 
treatment group experiencing AEs. 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized by treatment group 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ®) System 
Organ Class (SOC) and preferred teun, classified from verbatim terms 
(Version 18.1 or higher). The incidence and percentage of subjects with at 
least 1 occurrence of a preferred term will be included, according to the 
most severe grade using a 5-point scale (mild, moderate, severe, life 
threatening, or death). The number of events per preferred term will also 
be summarized. Causality (relationship to study treatment) will be 
summarized separately.

4 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects many parts of the body but is primarily 
manifested in the skin. It affects 2% to 3% of the population of the world, making it a very 
common inflammatory autoimmune disease. The most common form of psoriasis, called 
psoriasis vulgaris, accounts for over 80% of the people with psoriasis. This type of psoriasis 
appears as raised plaques of dry scaly skin that may affect multiple regions of the body. 
Psoriasis is graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the percentage of the body affected and 
the intensity of the inflammation. Several genetic loci have been associated with psoriasis and 
the major genetic determinant, psoriasis susceptibility, accounts for up to 50% of the hereditary 
aspects of the disease. This locus encodes several immune functions as well as epidermis-
associated proteins that are expressed and up-regulated in psoriasis. The genetic basis of 
sensitivity to psoriasis is supported by the fact that there is 70% concordance in identical twins. 
The pathogenesis of psoriasis is not fully understood. However, it has been recognized that the 
recently discovered T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which represent highly proinflammatory cells that 
function in the induction of multiple autoimmune diseases as well as enhancing the clearance of 
extracellular pathogens, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Th17 cells secrete 
IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, which can activate keratinocytes and endothelial cells in the skin. 
Antibodies directed against IL-17 have been approved by United States (US) Regulatory 
Authorities. Secukinumab is a human IL-17A antagonist indicated for the treatment of moderate 
to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or 
phototherapy. It is administered subcutaneously and has demonstrated robust efficacy in 4 well-
controlled clinical studies. The primary endpoints for these 4 studies were the proportion of 
subjects who achieved a reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PAST) score of at least 
75% (PAST 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (clear or almost clear) on the 
Physicians Global Assessment (PGA; modified 2011). An increase of infections was reported, 
as well as a few exacerbations of Crohn's disease and hypersensitivity. 
Another subcutaneous agent, ustekinumab, has been approved for the same indication. 
Ustekinumab is a human IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist indicated for the treatment of adult patients

(18 years or older) with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for 
phototherapy or systemic therapy. An increase of infections and a few cases of skin cancer were 
reported in 2 large placebo-controlled studies. 
One oral agent, apremilast (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4), has been approved for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates 
for phototherapy or systemic therapy. However, safety concerns such as depression, weight 
decrease, and issues with drug interactions due to a strong cytochrome P450 enzyme induction 
have been reported. Also, administration requires a titration at initiation due to gastrointestinal 
(GI) side effects. The efficacy at 16 weeks was relatively less than that observed secukinumab 
and ustekinumab. In 2 large controlled studies, efficacy results were PAST 75 of 33.1% and 
28.8% versus placebo 5.3% and 5.8%, with the static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of 
"clear" or "almost clear" of 21.7% and 20.4% versus placebo 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively. 
Apremilast is also approved for psoriatic arthritis. 
Several Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors have been studied for the therapy of psoriasis as well as 
other autoimmune diseases. However, none has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis to 
date. Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of Jak 3 with somewhat less activity against Jak 1 and Jak 2. It 
has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a twice daily (BED) oral 
medication for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and is marketed as XELJANZ ®, and has 
multiple severe infectious and immunologic side effects associated with therapy. Monotherapy 
with tofacitinib was associated with a modest increase in American College of Rheumatology 
20% (ACR20) improvement criteria compared with placebo (57% versus 26%). Ruxolitinib is a 
Jak 1 and Jak 2 inhibitor that has been approved for myelofibrosis. It has also been associated 
with severe side effects including bone marrow suppression. Both of the above Jak inhibitors 
have undergone initial clinical testing in psoriasis, but the side effect profile of this class of 
inhibitors has been troublesome. 
Several studies have been performed with etanercept and adalimumab, both of which block 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFcc) and have demonstrated efficacy in the therapy of rheumatoid 
arthritis, but no therapy has been as effective as IL-17 blockade in the therapy of psoriasis.

A number of biologic products have been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis. Interestingly, secukinumab, an IL-17 targeting agent, has shown robust 
efficacy with rapid onset. However, there are still safety concerns and most of these products are 
parenterally administered. Apremilast, which does not target IL-17, is an approved oral agent 
with an acceptable risk benefit. An oral agent such as KD025, which targets LL-17, could 
potentially provide an oral treatment option with an improved safety and efficacy profile. 	
4.1 	Study Rationale 
This proof-of-principle, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of KD025 administered orally for 16 weeks to subjects with moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Data 
collected in this study will be used along with data from previous KD025 studies to further 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KD025. 
Recent studies with KD025 have demonstrated that this molecule has anti-inflammatory activity 
mediated by the inhibition of secretion of IL-17 and IL-21 by Th17 cells. Since this pathway has 
emerged as a central inflammatory pathway in psoriasis, it is possible that an oral formulation 
(e.g., KD025) could offer significant advantages over other available oral foimulations. This 
study will provide safety and efficacy data of the therapeutic response to evaluate the risk/benefit 
of treating plaque psoriasis with KD025. 	
4.2 	Selection of Doses in this Study 
The only Rho kinase inhibitor that has published human dosing data is fasudil. Fasudil is a 
moderately selective kinase inhibitor but in contrast to KD025 has activity against both 
Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK1 and ROCK2). The potency of 
fasudil against ROCK2 is similar to KD025. Fasudil has been marketed in Japan for more than 
10 years as an intravenous drug for the prevention of cerebrovascular spasm after stroke. Fasudil 
was also under development for the treatment of chronic angina. In a Phase 2 clinical study in 
the US (Vicari et al, 2005), fasudil was dosed from 20 mg three times a day (TlD) up to 80 mg 
TlD over 8 weeks. At all doses tested, the adverse events (AEs) in the treatment arm were

reported as no different from placebo. In a separate study to examine endothelial function in 
subjects and healthy subjects (Nohria et al, 2006), fasudil was dosed at 40 mg TID for 30 days. 
The single-ascending dose (SAD)/multiple-ascending dose (MAD) (KDO25-101) and MAD 
(KDO25-102) studies support daily dosing with KD025 and have shown a safety profile that 
allows daily dosing up to 1000 mg per day. In addition, in Study KD025-103, a Phase 1, 
placebo-controlled study examining the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
500 mg of KD025 administered BID for 28 days in healthy male and post-menopausal female 
subjects for up to 28 days, the regimen was generally well tolerated. 
Phaimacodynamic (PD) studies in these normal healthy subjects have shown biological activity 
in inhibition of secretion of IL-17 and IL-21 by TH-17 cells in ex vivo stimulated peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells at the 120-, 240-, and 320-mg dose levels. Thus, the dosing selected in 
the proposed study (200 mg once daily [QD], 200 mg BID, 400 mg QD, and 600 mg/day) should 
be both safe and at a level at which biological activity has been measured. 
4.3 	Previous Clinical Experience with KD025 
A Phase 1 fed or fasted study (KD025-105) was conducted to evaluate the food effect as well as 
to further evaluate the safety and PK of a single 500-mg dose of KD025 administered orally to 
fed and fasted healthy males. 
Study results showed approximately a 3-fold higher exposure (maximum serum concentration 
[Cmax] and area under the curve [AUC]) in the fed state compared with the fasted state. There 
were no treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no treatment-related AEs were reported 
in any subject after receiving KD025 in either the fed or fasted state. There were no clinically 
relevant changes in vital signs, physical examination (PE) findings, or electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters. There were no clinically relevant changes and no clinically meaningful trends in 
hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis laboratory results attributable to study drug during this 
study. Plasma concentrations achieved in this study were comparable to plasma levels achieved 
in previous studies at similar dose levels, where breakfast was provided immediately after dose 
administration. These studies support dosing KD025 with food.

KD025-205 was a Phase 2a, open-label study in 8 adult subjects with moderately severe 
psoriasis vulgaris who have failed first-line therapy. As with the other studies, 200 mg QD 
KD025 administered daily for 28 days was generally safe and well tolerated. 
KD025-206 was a Phase 2a, open-label, dose-finding study in 36 adult subjects with moderately 
severe psoriasis vulgaris who have failed first-line therapy. The study was a 3-month, open-label 
study with 3 cohorts (200 mg BID, 400 mg QD, and 400 mg BID). KD025 was well tolerated in 
all subjects and demonstrated activity as measured by PASI. The only adverse experience was 
related to elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in 
approximately 20% of the subjects. The KD025 400-mg BID group showed the highest 
(Grade 3) elevations. The 400-mg BID dose will not be pursued in future studies.

5.6 	Overview of Study Design 
This will be a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy study. 
This study will be performed in adult male and female subjects with moderate to severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Subjects who have 
signed an IRB/IEC-approved ICF and met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. 
Approximately 110 subjects will be randomly assigned to each of the 5 dose cohorts in a 
1:1:1:1:1 manner to achieve 22 evaluable patients at 16 weeks in each cohort (Table 5-1). 
Table 5-1: Dosing Cohorts 
Cohort 1 22 subjects 200 mg KD025 QD 
Cohort 2 22 subjects 200 mg KD025 BID 
Cohort 3 22 subjects 400 mg KD025 QD 
Cohort 4 22 subjects 600 mg/day KD025 (administered as 400 mg in the morning 
and 200 mg in the evening) 
Cohort 5 22 subjects Matching placebo BID 
Abbreviations: BID = twice daily; QD = once daily 
Study drug will be orally administered in a double-blind fashion. 
During the 16 week, double-blind treatment period, data will be collected for the evaluation of 
efficacy of KD025.

All subjects will be given the option to receive KD025 400 mg QD for 32weeks in an open-label 
treatment period. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KD025 will be evaluated for the remaining 
period in the study. 
Subject status (relative to PASI) will be collected during the study for the evaluation of primary 
and secondary study endpoints. Response will be assessed by PAST, PGA, and DLQI scores at 
scheduled time points throughout the study. 
All subjects will have PD blood samples collected over the course of the study. 
Subjects will undergo medical history evaluations; PEs (including weight measurements); vital 
sign measurements; AE assessments; concomitant medication assessments; blood sample 
collection for hematology, chemistry, coagulation, lipid panel, and thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH), urinalysis; pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential; photography 
(optional); punch biopsy (optional); and ECGs. If a subject discontinues from the study prior to 
Week 16, an Early-Termination visit will be performed. All procedures are to be conducted 
immediately upon discontinuation. 
For all subjects, including those who discontinue prematurely from the study, a Follow-Up visit 
will occur 30 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of study drug. 
See Table 1-1 (Schedule of Assessments) for specific assessment time points.

Screening assessments outlined in this section and in Table 1-1 will be performed after obtaining 
a signed ICF. 
The timing for these study assessments is presented in Table 1-1 while a listing of clinical 
laboratory parameters to be measured is presented in Table 7-1. 
7.1 	General Study Procedures 
A description for each phase of the study is provided in this section. 
Confirmation that the most current MB/IEC-approved ICF has been signed should occur before 
any study-specific procedures are perfolined. All subjects who are enrolled and receive KD025 
or undergo study-specific procedures should be re-consented with any updated versions of 
IRB/IEC-approved ICFs during study participation as applicable and per institutional guidelines. 
7.1.1 Screening Enrollment 
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any study-specific procedures. 
After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened to assess eligibility 
for study participation. All screening assessments are to be performed within 28 days  prior to 
first study drug dose, unless otherwise specified. 
If significant changes from baseline are noted during the course of the study, additional 
unscheduled clinic visits may be undertaken by the investigator, or requested by the sponsor, in 
order to determine both the relevance of the finding(s) and the duration of the event(s). 
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be eligible to be enrolled in the study. 
7.1.2 Double-Blind Treatment Period 
Study Day 1 is defined as the date the subject takes the first dose of study drug, with subsequent 
visits numbered sequentially thereafter. Subjects satisfying eligibility requirements will be 
enrolled and should receive the first dose of study drug on Day 1 of the study. 
Procedures will be completed during the treatment period from Week 1 to Week 16 at the times 
designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1-1).

7.1.3 32-week Open-Label Continuation Period 
Procedures will be completed during the 32-week continuation period from Week 16 (after the 
completion of assessments in the double-blind treatment period) to Week 48 at the times 
designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1-1). 
7.1.4 Early-Termination Visit 
An Early-Termination visit will be scheduled for all subjects who discontinue prematurely from 
the study during the double-blind or open-label treatment periods and procedures are to be 
conducted immediately upon discontinuation (refer to Table 1-1). 
7.1.5 Unscheduled Visit 
Unscheduled visits and the assessments performed at those visits are at the investigator's 
discretion, but may include any or all of those listed in Table 1-1. 
7.1.6 30-day Follow-up Visit 
Approximately 30 days (± 3 days) after the subjects last dose of study drug, all subjects will 
complete a 30-day Follow-Up visit (Table 1-1). 
7.2 	Description of Study Procedures 
Refer to Table 1-1 for an outline of the procedures required at each study visit. Informed Consent 
Form. 
All subjects must take part in the ICF process. Adequate time must be allowed for the subject to 
ask questions and make a voluntary decision. No protocol-specific procedures, including 
screening procedures, are to be performed until the subject has signed and dated an

7.2.2 Physical Examination 
Physical examinations (PE) will include assessment of skeletal (i.e., muscle aches), neurological 
(i.e., gait) systems, height (screening only) and weight. All procedures will be performed by a 
physician or staff member who is qualified to perform such examinations (e.g., physician's 
assistant, nurse practitioner). 
Any abnormal or clinically significant findings from the PE must be recorded in the appropriate 
electronic case report form (eCRF). 
7.2.3 Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements will be collected after the subject has been sitting for 5 minutes. Vital 
sign assessments will include measurements of a sitting BP (mmHg), heart rate (beats per 
minute), respiratory rate (breaths per minute), and temperature (Fahrenheit). 
Note that BP measurements are to be performed using appropriate technique (per guidelines of 
the American Heart Association). Subjects must be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a 
chair with their backs supported, feet flat on floor (legs uncrossed), and arms bared on a hard 
surface, with the arm slightly abducted and bent, with palm up and the midpoint of upper arm at 
heart level. Correct cuff and bladder size should be utilized. Two or more readings separated by 
1 to 2 minutes should be averaged. If the first 2 readings differ by more than 5 mmHg, 
additional readings should be obtained and averaged. Record cuff size, arm used, and subject's 
position (if not seated). 
7.2.4 Laboratory Assessments 
A central laboratory will analyze hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, lipid panel, TSH, 
urinalysis, and biomarker tests. The results will be provided to the investigator (Table 7-1). 
Blood and urine samples for hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, lipid panel, TSH, 
antibody, and urinalysis will be obtained using standard procedures.

Abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests that lead to a change in subject management (e.g., dose 
delay, discontinuation, requirement for additional medication or monitoring) are considered 
clinically significant for the purposes of this study, and will be recorded on the AE eCRF page. 
With the exception of LFTs, laboratory results will be classified using the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Studies (see Appendix A). Laboratory results for ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and

bilirubin will be classified according to Table 9-2 in Section 9.4. If laboratory values constitute 
part of an event that meets criteria defining it as serious, the event (and associated laboratory 
values) must be reported as an SAE (see Section 11.3.1). 
7.2.5 12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
Supine 12-lead ECGs will be obtained prior to blood sample collection (tolerance window: -240 
minutes to 0 hour). 
Digital 12-lead ECG measurements are to be taken with the subject in a supine position and 
having rested in this position for at least 5 minutes before each reading. The ECG is to be 
repeated 3 times consecutively within 30 minutes (with a required interval of at least 1 to 
2 minutes between ECGs). At each visit, and when possible, the ECG is to be performed 
immediately prior to any blood sample collection. 
The following ECG parameters will be collected: PR interval, RR interval, QRS interval, QT 
interval, and QTc interval (QTc[F]; Fridericia's correction, see Appendix B for formula). The 
ECG findings will be evaluated by a qualified physician for the presence of abnormalities 
(qualitative assessment). The physician will assess each ECG as normal, abnormal/not clinically 
significant, or abnormal/clinically significant. 
Abnormalities in the ECG that lead to a change in subject management (e.g., dose interruption or 
delay, requirement for additional medication or monitoring) or result in clinical signs and 
symptoms are considered clinically significant for the purposes of this study and will be recorded 
on the AE eCRF. If ECG abnormalities meet criteria defining them as serious, they must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 11.3.1). 
7.2.6 Pregnancy Testing 
Urine pregnancy tests will be collected for women of childbearing potential. Positive results will 
be confirmed with serum testing. 
7.2.7 Randomization 
Following the completion of screening assessments, eligible, consenting subjects will be 
randomized to 1 of 5 dose cohorts. See Section 5.7 for further details.

7.2.8 Punch Biopsy (Optional) 
Punch biopsies will be obtained from at least 75% of the subjects. Subjects have the option to 
decline the punch biopsy. Punch biopsies will be taken from clear unaffected skin and a selected 
lesion will be collected predose on Day 1 (Week 1) and from the selected lesion on Day 112 
(Week 16). Biopsies will be obtained through a standard punch biopsy procedure. These 
biopsies will be analyzed for PD markers associated with psoriasis and with Rho Kinase 
inhibition. 
7.2.9 Blood Sampling for Pharmacodynamics 
Blood sample collection for PD will be performed at all sites (refer to Table 1-1 for time points). 
All subjects will have PD blood samples collected over the course of the study. Subjects who 
elect to continue therapy will also have PD blood samples collected. 
For any subject who discontinues prematurely, blood for PD evaluation will be collected at the 
Early Termination visit. 
Samples will be evaluated for the expression of the psoriasis-associated cytokine, IL-17, in 
plasma. Detailed instructions for sample collection and preparation will be provided in a separate 
manual. 
7.2.10 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Scoring 
• The PAST is a measure of the psoriasis disease severity using the average redness, thickness, and 
scaliness of the lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighted by the area of involvement 
Page 44 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 12 Mar 2019 Kadmon Corporation 
KDO25 	
IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
(Wozel eta!, 2005). PAST combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area 
affected into a single score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). 
To score the PAST, the body is divided into 4 sections 
• head (Id): 10% of a person's skin 
• arms (A): 20%) of a person's skin 
• trunk (T): 30%) of a person's skin 
• legs (L): 40% of a person's skin 
Each of these areas is scored by itself, and then the 4 scores are combined into the final PAST. 
For each section, the percent of area of skin involved, is estimated and then transformed into a 
grade from 0 to 6: 
• Grade 0: 0% of involved area 
• Grade 1: <10% of involved area 
• Grade 2: 10%-29% of involved area 
• Grade 3: 30%-49% of involved area 
• Grade 4: 50%-69% of involved area 
• Grade 5: 70%-89% of involved area 
• Grade 6: 90%-100% of involved area 
Within each area, the severity is estimated by 3 clinical signs: erythema (redness), induration 
(thickness), and desquamation (scaling). Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 4, 
from none to maximum. 
The sum of all 3 severity parameters is then calculated for each section of skin, multiplied by the 
area score for that area and multiplied by weight of respective section (0.1 for head, 0.2 for arms, 
0.3 for body, and 0.4 for legs). 
7.2.11 Relative Physician's Global Assessment 
The relative PGA documents the physician's assessment of the subject's psoriasis status 
(Robinson 2012). Consideration should be given to the percent of body involvement as well as 
overall induration, scaling, and erythema (refer to Appendix C).

The DLQI is a skin disease-specific instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a 
subject's quality of life (Finlay et al, 1994). Refer to Appendix D for the complete 
questionnaire. 
7.2.12 Photography (Optional) 
Subjects have the option to participate in the photography of selected lesions. The same lesions 
should be photographed throughout the study. Further information can be found in the Kadmon 
photography manual. 
7.2.13 Study Drug Administration 
Subjects will receive an adequate supply of study drug for the intervals between the visits 
scheduled for study drug administration. During the double-blind treatment period, study drug 
will be dispensed in a blinded fashion and each subject will receive 2 tablets to take each 
morning and 1 tablet to take each evening. During the 32-week continuation period, all subjects 
will receive open-label 400 mg KD025 QD, as two 200 mg tablets to be taken in the morning. 
At each designated visit, subjects will receive the morning dose (2 tablets) of study drug in the 
clinic. Subjects will self-administer the balance of daily doses of study drug at home. 
Each dose of study drug should be taken together with a meal or within 5 minutes of finishing a 
meal. See Section 9.1 for further infounation regarding the dosing schedule and Section 9.3 for 
guidance regarding missed doses. 
7.2.14 Subject Drug Diaries 
Subjects will be required to keep study drug diaries in which they will record the date of study 
drug administrations. These diaries will be dispensed at the Day 1 (Week 1) visit. Final 
collection will be at Week 16 for those who do not wish to continue into the open-label period. 
For subjects that complete the open-label treatment period the diary will be collected at the Week 
48 visit. For subjects who discontinue the study prematurely, the diary will be collected at the 
Early-Termination visit. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medications, including corticosteroids and changes in corticosteroid usage 
during the study, will be collected from the time the subject signs the ICF throughout the 
subject's participation in the study.

Information regarding the occurrence of AEs will be collected from the time subjects sign the 
ICF throughout their participation in the study, including a period of 30 days after last dose of 
study drug. 
Note: AEs resulting in a subject's peiiiianent discontinuation from the study, 
regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug, MUST be 
promptly reported to the sponsor.

8 REMOVING SUBJECTS FROM STUDY 
Every reasonable effort will be made to keep the subject in the study; however, in the event that 
a subject is withdrawn from the study, every effort will be made by the investigator to complete 
and report the reasons for withdrawal as thoroughly as possible. This evaluation should include 
final observations, as required by the protocol at the time of the subject's withdrawal. The 
reason(s) for termination must be clearly documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF. A 
termination eCRF must be completed for any subject who is enrolled in the study. 
8.1 	Subject Withdrawal 
A subject's participation in the study may be discontinued for any of the following reasons: 
8.1.1 Treatment Discontinuation 
• An AE requires permanent discontinuation of study drug 
• Voluntary withdrawal by subject 
• Noncompliance to protocol 
8.1.2 Study Discontinuation 
In the event of premature discontinuation, every effort should be made to have the subject come 
to the clinic for an Early-Teunination and 30-day Follow-Up visit in order for the investigator to 
collect all clinical and laboratory data as scheduled. (Refer to Table 1-1, Schedule of 
Assessments for a complete list of procedures to be performed.) If a subject dies, Kadmon will 
actively seek to know the date of death. 
Subjects who are withdrawn from this study due to toxicity are to be followed until: 
• Resolution or stabilization of toxicity 
• The subject is lost to follow-up 
• The event is otherwise explained 
If there is an ongoing toxicity due to KD025, subjects must be followed with appropriate medical 
management until resolution or stabilization. 
A reasonable effort should be made to contact any subject lost to follow-up during the course of 
the study in order to complete assessments and retrieve any outstanding data. If the subjects are

unreachable by telephone after 3 attempts, a certified registered return receipt letter should be 
sent requesting that contact be made with the investigator to report updated infoiniation. 
8.2 	Stopping Rules 
Stopping criteria will be assessed using the Clinical Symptom Adverse Event Grading scale 
(Appendix E) and will include clinically significant changes with respect to BP, dyspepsia, 
nausea or vomiting, or other treatment-emergent AEs that are Grade 2 (moderate) or higher. 
8.2.1 Adverse Events Stopping Criteria 
• AEs of clinical concern 
• Grade 2 (moderate) or higher TEAEs that are determined by the investigator to be 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug (with the exception of 
liver-related adverse events, see Section 9.4); 
• Clinically significant elevation of ALT or AST. See Section 9.4 for risk management 
of LFTs changes observed during the study. 
8.2.2 Blood Pressure Stopping Criteria 
BP is to be measured with the subject in a sitting position according to the guidelines in 
Section 7.2.4. BP measurements meeting stopping criteria should be repeated once, to confirm 
the measurement. The repeat measurement will be used to determine whether the subject meets 
the stopping criteria. 
Clinically significant BP decreases will be defined as follows: 
• An absolute systolic BP (SBP) < 85 mmHg at any time point, or a decrease 
> 30 mmHg in SBP from baseline with accompanying symptoms of hypotension at 
any time point, or an asymptomatic decrease > 30 mmHg from baseline on any 
2 consecutive time points 
OR 
• An absolute diastolic BP (DBP) <45 mmHg at any time point, or a decrease 
>20 mmHg in DBP from baseline with accompanying symptoms of hypotension at 
any time point, or an asymptomatic decrease > 20 mmHg in DBP from baseline on 
2 consecutive time points. 
Clinically significant BP increases are defined as:

Confidential and Proprietary 12 Mar 2019 Kadmon Corporation 
KDO25 	lND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
• An absolute SBP > 180 mmHg at any time point, or an increase > 30 mmHg in SBP 
from baseline with accompanying symptoms of hypertension at any time point, or an 
asymptomatic increase > 30 mmHg from baseline on any 2 consecutive time points 
OR 
• An absolute DBP > 110 mmHg at any time point, or an increase >20 mmHg in DBP 
from baseline with accompanying symptoms of hypertension at any time point, or an 
asymptomatic increase > 20 mmHg in DBP from baseline on 2 consecutive time 
points. 
8.3 	Study Termination 
Kadmon Corporation has the right to terminate or to stop the study at any time. Reasons for 
study discontinuation may include, but are not limited to the following: 
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other related studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects 
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory 
• Drug supply issues 
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete 
• Excessive subject self-withdrawal 
• Significant protocol violations (e.g., violation of eligibility criteria, dosing errors, 
missing data for study endpoint analysis) 
8.4 Replacements 
Subjects withdrawn from the study prior to receiving any study drug will be replaced by 
enrolling additional subjects into the study.

Cohort 5 22 subjects Control (subjects will receive 2 matching 
placebo tablets in the morning and 1 matching 
placebo tablet in the evening) 
Each dose of study drug should be taken together with a meal or within 5 minutes of finishing a 
meal. 
Subjects will return to the clinic as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1-1), and will 
receive the morning dose of study drug (2 tablets) during visits when PD samples are to be 
drawn. Subjects will self-administer the balance of daily doses of study drug at home.

9.2 	32-Week Open-Label KD025 Therapy (Week 16 through Week 48) 
Subjects randomized to KD025 or placebo will have the option to continue 400 mg of KD025 
QD treatment for an additional 32 weeks in the open-label treatment period. 	
9.3 	Missed Doses 
• Subjects should make every effort to take the study drug at the same scheduled times 
daily, morning and evening. In the event that the subject misses the planned dose of 
study drug, the following protocol should be followed: If less than 6 hours of time 
have elapsed after the scheduled dose, the drug should be taken and the subject 
should resume their dosing schedule with the next dose. 
• If more than 6 hours of time have elapsed after the scheduled dose, the dose should be 
skipped. The subject should resume the regular planned dosing schedule. 
If the subject skips more than 7 consecutive days of drug, the subject should be discontinued 
from the study. If the subject cannot take KD025 for more than 7 consecutive days due to a 
toxicity, the subject is allowed to re-start study drug. 	
9.4 	Evaluation of Liver-Related Blood Tests 
Clinically significant elevations of liver-related blood tests as defined below require immediate 
drug termination. 
1. ALT or AST > 5 xULN 
2. ALT or AST > 3 xULN and (total bilirubin > 2 xULN or DNR >1.5) 
3. ALT or AST > 3 xULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%) 
4. If the total bilirubin is >2 xULN then obtain direct bilirubin 
If ALT or AST > 2.0 xULN, the subject should remain on study drug with close observation 
which includes: 
1. Repeating liver enzyme, every 48 to 72 hours 
(Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or 
the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic.) 
2. Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases

• Storage conditions 
• Product identification code 
• Lot number identification 
• Bottle number 
• Name of protocol sponsor 
• The statement, "Caution: New Drug — Limited by Federal Law to Investigational 
Use" 
• The statement, "Keep out of the reach of children and pets" 	
9.7 	Dispensing of Study Drug and Dosing Compliance 
The amount of study drug dispensed to the subject at the beginning of each dosing month should 
be sufficient to allow for 1 month of dosing. In the 32-week continuation period, the amount of 
KD025 dispensed at each visit will be sufficient to allow for dosing until the next visit. 
The investigator (or designee) will be responsible for recording this information on the 
appropriate study drug inventory. This inventory will be maintained throughout the duration of 
the study and will be periodically reviewed by a representative of the sponsor. 
The investigator (or designee) will instruct the subject that all dispensed bottles must be returned 
at each follow-up visit, at which time a tablet count will be conducted to assure subject dosing 
compliance. 
Additionally, subjects will be required to keep study drug diaries in which they will record the 
details of study drug administrations. These diaries will be dispensed and/or collected according 
to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1-1). 	
9.8 	Study Drug Storage 
All supplies of study drug are to be stored at United States Pharmacopeia controlled room 
temperature of 20°C to 25°C (66°F to 77°F) with excursions pelinitted between 15°C and 30°C 
(59°F and 86°F). At the clinic, the study drugs are to be stored in a securely locked area, 
accessible to authorized persons only, until needed for dosing.

9.9 	Study Drug Accountability 
The US FDA and other regulatory agencies require accounting for the disposition of all 
investigational drugs received by each clinical site. Information on drug disposition required by 
law consists of the date received, date administered, quantity administered, and the subject to 
whom the drug was administered. The principal investigator is responsible for the accounting 
for all unused study drugs and all used study drug containers. The investigator must maintain a 
complete and current dispensing and inventory record that has been supplied by the sponsor. 
9.10 Study Drug Handling 
At the termination of the study, a final drug accountability review and reconciliation must be 
completed and any discrepancies must be investigated and their resolution documented. 
9.10.1 Disposition of Used Supplies 
At the completion of a subject's participation in the study, all partially used and empty pill 
bottles must be returned to the investigator (or designee) so that a final subject-dosing inventory 
may be conducted. This information will be recorded on the Drug Dispensing Log. 
9.10.2 Inventory of Unused Supplies 
Periodically throughout and at the conclusion of the study, an inventory of unused bottles of 
study drug will be conducted by a representative of the sponsor.

10 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION AND TREATMENT 
Subjects will be counseled to avoid non-prescribed medicines or complementary alternative 
medicines excluded by the study. Any medications a subject receives from signing ICF through 
the end of study (30-Day Follow-Up visit) will be documented. After discontinuation of study 
drug, any concomitant medication used in response to an AE is to be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF. 
Administration of acid-reducing medications should be avoided during the study as these agents 
may decrease exposure to KD025. If acid-reducing agents are needed, H-2 antagonists or 
antacids will be recommended rather than proton pump inhibitors. Administration of 
acid-reducing agents such as H-2 antagonists or antacids, if required, should take place no less 
than 2 hours before or after dosing with KD025. 
Subjects may be receiving low-dose oral corticosteroids (< 10 mg daily prednisone or 
equivalent) at study entry. Oral corticosteroid dose must be stable for at least 1 month prior to 
study entry and expected to remain stable throughout participation. Any changes in systemic 
corticosteroid dose will be documented on the eCRF. Topical corticosteroids or 
immunosuppressive therapies to the face, groin, or scalp are allowed. 
Prior systemic treatment, including biologics, is to be recorded on the eCRF, including duration 
of exposure and reason for discontinuation. 
The concomitant medication names will be coded by the sponsor according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary and classified by anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) 
categories.

11 SAFETY 
11.1 Safety Parameters 
The Clinical Symptom and Adverse Event Grading Scale will be used for grading toxicities (see 
Appendix E). With the exception of LFTs, laboratory results will be classified using the 
Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive 
Vaccine Clinical Studies (see Appendix A). LFTs will be classified using Table 9-2 in 
Section 9.4. Subjects will be monitored throughout the treatment and follow-up period for 
occurrence of AEs, as well as for changes in clinical status, vital sign measurements, and 
laboratory data. 
11.2 Adverse Event Definition 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. AEs include: 
• Suspected adverse drug reactions (abbreviated as either SADR or SAR). This may be 
serious or not serious 
• Reactions from drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity 
• Significant changes or abnormalities, when compared with baseline, in structure 
(sign), function (symptom), clinical laboratory results, ECG results, or physiological 
testing. This includes any worsening of a pre-existing condition temporally 
associated with the use of study drug 
• Other medical events, regardless of their relationship to the study drug, such as injury, 
surgery, accidents, extensions of symptoms, or apparently unrelated illnesses 
For the purpose of data collection, all untoward events that occur after ICF through 30 days after 
last dose of study treatment are to be recorded on eCRFs by the investigational site. 
11.3 Evaluating Adverse Events 
The investigator will determine the seriousness, intensity, and causality of an AE associated with 
the use of the study drug (i.e., events where there is a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by the study drug) based on the definitions that follow. 
Kadmon Corporation 	 Page 57 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietaly 12 Mar 2019 
KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
11.3.1 Serious Adverse Events 
(Notify sponsor or designee within 24 hours; document on eCRF) 
The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance with Title 21 Part Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and the Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety 
Reporting Requirements for Investigational New Drug (ID) applications and 
bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies. 
SAE: An adverse event is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death: This includes any death that occurs while the subject is "on study" as well as any 
death that occurs within 30 days after study drug administration. 
Note: Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself. The event(s) that 
caused death (e.g., illness, accident) is the SAE. Death due to any other 
cause(s) must also be reported as an outcome of the reportable SAE. 
• Life-threatening AE:  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
"life-threatening" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence 
places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected 
adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization:  
In the absence of an AE, the investigator should not report hospitalization or prolongation 
of hospitalization. This is the case in the following situations: 
o Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a procedure 
required by the protocol 
o Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of routine procedure 
followed by study center 
o Hospitalization for survey visits or annual physicals 
In addition, a hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a pre-existing condition 
which has not worsened does not count as an SAE.

KDO25 	
IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical event: An event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
11.3.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
(Notify sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first awareness; document on eCRF) 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is any adverse drug event, the 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with those noted in the current protocol and/or 
lB. This refers to any AE that has not been previously observed (e.g., included in the D3), rather 
than from the perspective of such an event not being anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the product. 
11.3.3 Unexpected Adverse Events 
An AE is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the lB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or, if an lB is not required or available, is not consistent with the 
risk infoimation described in the General Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. The term also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the lB as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
11.3.4 Non-Serious Adverse Events 
All other AEs, not fulfilling the previous definitions, are classified as non-serious. 
11.3.5 Protocol-Related Adverse Events 
AEs that are not study drug related may nevertheless be considered by the investigator or the 
medical monitor to be related to the conduct of the clinical study. That is, the event may be 
related to the fact that a subject is participating in the study. For example, a protocol-related AE 
Kadmon Corporation 12 Mar 2019 Page 59 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
may be an event that occurs during a washout period or that is related to a procedure required by 
the protocol. 
11.3.6 Relationship to Study Drug 
The investigator will attempt to assess the relationship of the event to study drug using a 5-point 
scale (not related, unlikely related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related; see 
Appendix F; Clinical Adverse Events: Determining Relationship to Study Drug). 
11.3.7 Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the Adverse Event page of the 
subject's eCRF during the subject's participation in the study. The severity of each AE will be 
graded using a 5-point scale (mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, or death; see Appendix E). 
The date of onset as well as the end date of the event also should be recorded or the event should 
be entered as "ongoing". In addition, the method used to treat the AE and the outcome of the AE 
also will be noted. The investigator will assess the relationship of the event to study drug. 
11.3.8 Hospitalization 
In the absence of an AE, the investigator should not report hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization. This is the case in the following situations: 
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a procedure required by 
the protocol. 
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of routine procedure followed by 
study center. 
• Hospitalization for survey visits or annual physicals. 
In addition, a hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a pre-existing condition that 
has not worsened does not count as an SAE. 
11.3.9 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
11.3.9.1 Governing Regulatory Requirements 
Compliance with this request for prompt reporting is essential in that the sponsor is responsible 
for informing the US FDA as well as all other participating investigators of the event.

Under FDA ruling (Title 21 CFR Part 312.32) and the Guidance for Industry and Investigators 
Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies, the sponsor is required to submit 
written documentation, in the form of an IND safety report, detailing: 
• Any event associated with the use of the drug, that is both serious and unexpected, or 
• Any findings from clinical, epidemiological, or pooled analysis of multiple studies or any 
findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed 
to the drug. 
Written submission must be made by the sponsor to the FDA and the lRBs as soon as possible 
and in no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of notification of the 
event. Any unexpected death or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction must be reported to 
FDA no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. The 
sponsor shall also infoim all investigators. 
11.3.9.2 Time-Frame for Reporting 
Any death, pregnancy, SAE, or unexpected (and severe) AE experienced by a subject after ICF 
or within 30 days of receiving study drug, regardless of relationship to study drug, or any death 
that occurs more than 30 days after receiving study drug, and is believed to be study 
drug-related, must be promptly reported (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of 
the event) by e-mail to the sponsor (or sponsor's designee).

11.3.9.3 Information to be Provided by the Investigator 
SAEs for all enrolled subjects must be recorded on both the SAE form and the AE eCRF page. 
This requirement includes all SAEs that occur after the subject signs the ICF and through 
30 days after last dose of study treatment, and in addition, any SAEs that are assessed as possibly 
related to study treatment by the investigator, even if the SAE occurs more than 30 days after the 
last dose of study treatment must be reported to the Kadmon Phannacovigilance Department. 
The minimum information required for SAE reporting includes identity of investigator, site 
number, subject number, an event description, SAE teim(s), onset date, the reason why the event 
is considered to be serious (i.e., the seriousness criteria) and the investigator's assessment of the 
relationship of the event to study treatment. Additional SAE information including medications 
or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, action taken with the study treatment due to 
the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event will be recorded on the SAE form. Forms for 
reporting SAEs will be provided to the study sites. 
In all cases, the investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. Furthermore, the investigator 
may be required to provide supplementary infoiniation as requested by the Kadmon Drug Safety 
personnel or designee. 
When reporting an SAE, the following additional points should be noted: 
• When the diagnosis of an SAE is known or suspected, the investigator should report 
the diagnosis or syndrome as the primary SAE term, rather than as signs or 
symptoms. Signs and symptoms may then be described in the event description. For 
Page 62 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 12 Mar 2019 Kadmon Corporation 
KDO25 	1ND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
example, dyspnea should not be used as an SAE term if the diagnosis which caused 
the dyspnea is known to be malignant pleural effusion. 
• Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE, unless 
the event preceding the death is unknown. In the exceptional case where the events 
leading to death are unknown, then death may be used as an event tetra. If an autopsy 
was performed, the autopsy report should be provided. 
• While most hospitalizations necessitate reporting of an SAE, some hospitalizations do 
not require SAE reporting, as follows: 
o Elective or previously scheduled surgery (e.g., a previously scheduled ventral 
hernia repair) 
o Procedures for pre-existing conditions that have not worsened after initiation 
of treatment 
o Pre-specified study hospitalizations for observation 
o Events that result in hospital stays of less than 24 hours and that do not require 
admission (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a 
diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics) 
• SAEs must, however, be reported for any surgical or procedural complication 
resulting in prolongation of the hospitalization. 
11.3.9.4 Regulatory Reporting 
Kadmon Drug Safety (or designee) will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are 
received. For each SAE received, Kadmon will make a determination as to whether the criteria 
for expedited reporting have been met. 
Kadmon (or designee) will submit SAEs that meet the criteria for expedited reporting to the 
Regulatory Authorities in accordance with local regulations governing safety reporting. 
Reporting of SAEs by the investigator to his or her IRB will be done in accordance with the 
standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB. Adequate documentation must be 
maintained showing that the IRB was properly notified. 
As a general rule, treatment codes will be broken by authorized member of the sponsor and/or 
designee Drug Safety staff before reporting an SAE that meets the criteria for expediting 
Page 63 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 12 Mar 2019 Kadmon Corporation 
KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
reporting to the Regulatory Authorities. The investigator and sponsor staff that are not part of 
the Drug Safety Department will remain blinded to the treatment assignment. 
The blind should ordinarily be broken for IND safety reports submitted to the FDA. If a sponsor 
has concerns that unblinding of AEs will compromise the integrity of the study, the sponsor can 
propose in advance an alternative reporting format or frequency to maintain the blind that must 
be agreed to by the director of the review division in FDA with responsibility for review of the 
IND (21 CFR 312.32(c)(3)). Other Safety Considerations 
11.3.10 Laboratory Data 
All laboratory data obtained during the course of the study should be reviewed. Any abnoi 	nal 
value that leads to a change in subject management (e.g., dose delay, requirement for additional 
medication or monitoring) or is considered to be of clinical significance by the investigator 
should be reported as an AE and/or SAE as appropriate, unless this value is consistent with the 
subject's present disease state or is consistent with values obtained prior to entry into the study. 
With the exception of LFTs, laboratory results will be classified using the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Studies (see Appendix A). LFTs will be classified using Table 9-2 in Section 9.4. 
11.3.11 Medication Errors 
Any medication error that results in an AE, even if it does not meet the definition of serious, 
requires reporting within 24 hours to the safety monitor. 
11.3.12 Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
Any SAE or AE assessed as possibly related that led to treatment discontinuation (including 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory values that meet these criteria) and is ongoing 30 days 
after last dose of study treatment must be followed until either resolution of the event or 
determination by the investigator that the event has become stable or irreversible. This 
follow-up guidance also applies to possibly related SAEs that occur more than 30 days after last 
dose of study treatment. The status of all other continuing AEs will be documented as, of 30 days 
after last dose of study treatment.

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
All descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS statistical 
software (Version 9.4), unless otherwise noted. For categorical variables, the number and 
percent of each category within a parameter will be calculated for non-missing data. For 
continuous variables, the mean, median, and standard deviation (SD), as well as the minimum 
and maximum values, will be presented. 
Statistical significance will be declared when the p-value is found to be < 0.05, unless otherwise 
noted. Missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise stated. All clinical data captured will 
be provided in data listings. 
Complete details of the planned analysis will be documented in the SAP. 
12.1 General Design 
All data for enrolled subjects will be presented in data listings by subject number. For those 
summary tables in which baseline and change from baseline measurements will be presented, the 
last observed measurement prior to the initial dose of KD025 will be considered the baseline 
measurement. 
Continuous data will be described using descriptive statistics: number of observations (n), mean, 
SD, median, minimum, and maximum. Frequencies and percentages will be used for 
summarizing discrete (categorical) data. When categorical data are presented, the percent will be 
suppressed when the count is zero in order to draw attention to the non-zero counts. The 
denominator for all percentages, unless otherwise specified, will be the number of subjects in the 
specified analysis population. Two-sided 95% confidence interval employing the exact binomial 
method will be provided for efficacy activity endpoints. 
Hypothesis testing, if appropriate, will be carried out at the 5% (2-sided) significance level. Due 
to the exploratory nature of the study, no adjustments may be made for the multiplicity of 
endpoints. Non-parametric tests may be used in preference to parametric tests if the underlying 
distributions of the data are not known. Missing values will not be imputed. If a subject does 
not have sufficient data for a particular analysis, then, that subject will be excluded from that 
Kadmon Corporation 12 Mar 2019 Page 65 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	lND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
analysis. Endpoints defined as an average of multiple measurements will be used for those data 
points that were non-missing, and the denominator will be adjusted accordingly. 
12.2 Sample Size Justification 
The sample size will be 110 subjects due to early study termination. 
12.3 Study Populations 
Two populations will be employed in the analysis of study data: 
• The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population will consist of all subjects who are 
randomized and take at least 1 dose of study drug. All safety analyses will be 
performed on the mITT population. The Evaluable for Efficacy population will 
consist of subjects who have non-missing baseline and Week 16 PAST scores and do 
not have a major protocol violation. 
Demographics, subject disposition, and screening and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized for mITT populations, where appropriate. 
12.4 Subject Accountability, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics 
Subject disposition will be tabulated by treatment group. Similarly, subject demographic 
information and baseline characteristics will be displayed. 	. 
12.5 KD025 Exposure 
The amount of KID 025 administered by visit and overall will be tabulated by treatment group and 
presented by subject in data listings. In addition, delays and all other alterations in KD025 
administration will be presented. 
12.6 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO Drug Dictionary and the data will be 
summarized by treatment and presented in tables and listings. 
12.7 Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint for analyses will be the number (%) of subjects with a 
75% decrease in PAST by Week 16. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for analysis will include the following: 
Kadmon Corporation 12 Mar 2019 Page 66 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
1. A 50% reduction in Week 16 PASI score (PAST 50) 
2. The mean Week 16 percent change from baseline in PAST 
3. Improvements in PGA of "clear" or "almost clear" at Week 16 
4. Improvements in DLQI at Week 16 
The exploratory efficacy endpoints are: 
• To evaluate the concentration and changes in IL-17 expression in blood, tissue, 
and other biomarkers in punch biopsy after 16 weeks of dosing with KD025 
Efficacy analyses will be divided into 2 periods: the double-blind treatment period through 
database lock at Week 16 and the open-label, 32-week continuation period. 
Efficacy analyses will include the number (%) of subjects with a 75% decrease in PAST (number 
of subjects that reach PAST 75) at Week 16 in the KD025 treatment groups compared with the 
placebo group in a pairwise manner using a Fisher's Exact test. The number of subjects who 
reach PAST 50 at Week 16 will be analyzed similarly. Treatment group differences in DLQI and 
PGA changes from baseline to Week 16 will be assessed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect and a subject's baseline value as a covariate. 
No adjustments for multiplicity are being made for this Phase 2 study. 
For further details, see the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
12.8 Safety Data 
Safety assessments will include AEs, SAEs, PEs (including weight), vital sign measurements 
(including BP, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation, lipid panel, TSH) ECGs, and reasons for 
treatment discontinuation due to toxicity. 
The primary safety endpoint will be the percentage of subjects in each treatment group 
experiencing AEs. 
TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group using MedDRA ®  SOC and preferred term, 
classified from verbatim terms (Version 18.1 or higher). The incidence and percentage of 
subjects with at least 1 occurrence of a preferred term will be included, according to the most 
Kadmon Corporation 12 Mar 2019 Page 67 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	lND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
severe grade using a 5-point scale (mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, or death). The 
number of events per preferred term will also be summarized. Causality (relationship to study 
treatment) will be summarized separately. 
AEs, SAEs, related AEs, related SAEs, > Grade 3 AEs, related > Grade 3 AEs, and AEs leading 
to withdrawal or treatment discontinuation will be summarized by treatment group according to 
SOC and preferred terms. AEs will also be presented in listings. Duration of AEs will be 
determined and included in listings, along with action taken and outcome. 
Laboratory results will be classified using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Studies (see Appendix A) and 
summarized. Incidence of laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by treatment group. The 
worst on-study grade after the first dose of study drug will be summarized by treatment group. 
The incidence of? Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities under treatment and shifts in toxicity 
grading from baseline to highest grade post-baseline will be displayed. 
Vital sign measurements will be summarized at each scheduled time point using descriptive 
statistics.

13 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
Accurate and reliable data collection will be ensured by verification and cross-check of the 
eCRFs against the investigator's records by the study monitor (source document verification) and 
by the maintenance of a drug-dispensing log by the investigator. Collected data will be entered 
into a computer database and subject to electronic and manual quality assurance procedures.

14 ETHICAL ASPECTS 
14.1 Local Regulations 
The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in "Guideline for Good Clinical Practice" 
ICH E6 Tripartite Guideline (January 1997), and in general, be conducted in a manner consistent 
with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The investigator will ensure that the 
conduct of the study complies with the basic principles of GCP as outlined in the current version 
of 21 CFR, subpart D, Part 312, "Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators", Part 50, 
"Protection of Human Subjects", and Part 56, -  "Institutional Review Boards". 
14.2 Informed Consent Form 
Sample ICFs will be supplied to each site. Kadmon or its designee must review any ICF prior to 
submission for review by the IRB. The final IRB-approved document must be provided to 
Kadmon for regulatory purposes. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, to obtain a 
written ICF from each subject (or the subject's legally authorized representative) agreeing to 
participate in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards of the study in accordance with federal and state regulations is provided. In the 
case where the subject is unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire 
ICF discussion. After the subject has orally consented to participation in the study, the witness' 
signature on the form will attest that the information in the consent fowl was accurately 
explained and understood. A copy of the ICF must be provided to the subject or to the subject's 
legally authorized representative. If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of 
the local language. 
The eCRF for this study contains a section for documenting informed subject consent, and this 
must be completed appropriately. Signed ICFs must remain in each subject's study file and must 
be available for verification by study monitors at any time. If new safety information results in 
changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated as 
necessary. All subjects (including those already being treated) should be informed of the new 
Kadmon Corporation 12 Mar 2019 Page 70 of 90

KDO25 	
lND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
information, should be given a copy of the revised form, and should give their consent to 
continue in the study. 
14.3 Institutional Review Board 
This study is being conducted under a US IND application. This protocol (and any 
modifications) and appropriate consent procedures must be reviewed and approved by an IRB. 
This board must operate in accordance with the current federal or local regulations. The 
investigator will send a letter or certificate of IRB approval to Kadmon (or designee) before 
subject enrollment and whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made. 
14.4 Future Use of Subject Samples 
Not all of the tissue and blood components obtained during this study may be required for the 
tests that are part of the clinical study. Following the conclusion of the study, the samples may 
be used for additional research. This research will help to understand disease subtypes, drug 
response and toxicity, and possibly identify new drug targets or biomarkers that predict subject 
response to treatment. The use of the samples for internal research will be done according to the 
guidelines defined by the FDA guidance for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover 
Human Specimens that are Not Individual Identifiable (issued 25 April 25 2006) and the 
European Medicines Agency (EMEA) Reflection Paper on Pharmacogenetic Samples, Testing 
and Data Handling (EMEA/CHMP/PGxWP/201914/2006). If a subject requests destruction of 
their blood samples and the samples have not yet been de-identified, Kadmon will destroy the 
samples as described in this FDA guidance. Kadmon will notify the investigator in writing that 
the samples have been destroyed.

15 CONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL 
Protocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between a 
Kadmon representative and the investigator. Protocol modifications will be reviewed and 
approved by Kadmon representatives. 
All protocol modifications must be submitted to the lin for information and approval in 
accordance with local requirements, and to regulatory agencies if required. Approval must be 
obtained before any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects, or when the change involves only logistical or administrative 
aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor, change of telephone number).

17 STUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS, AND RECORD KEEPING 
17.1 Investigator's Files and Retention of Documents 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should 
be classified into 2 separate categories as follows: (1) investigator's study files; and (2) subject 
clinical source documents. 
The investigator's study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments, eCRFs, lRB, 
and governmental approval with correspondence, sample ICF, drug records, staff curriculum 
vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
Subject clinical source documents (usually predefined by the project to record key efficacy and 
safety parameters independent of the eCRFs) may include subject hospital/clinic records, 
physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, 
electroencephalogram, X-ray, pathology, and special assessment reports, signed ICFs, consultant 
letters, and subject screening and enrollment logs. The investigator must keep these 2 categories 
of documents on file for at least 2 years following the marketing application approval date for the 
study treatment and for the indication being investigated or for 2 years after the investigation is 
discontinued and the FDA notified. After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed 
subject to local regulations with prior written permission from Kadmon. If the investigator 
wants to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, Kadmon 
must be notified in advance. 
If the investigator cannot guarantee the archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and Kadmon to 
store these in a sealed container outside of the study site so that they can be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the subject, appropriate copies should be made for storing outside of the study site. 
17.2 Source Documents and Background Data 
Upon request, the investigator will supply Kadmon with any required background data from the 
study documentation or clinic records. In case of special problems or governmental queries or 
Kadmon Corporation Page 74 of 90 12 Mar 2019 
Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, 
provided that subject confidentiality is protected. 
17.3 Audits and Inspections 
The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the Kadmon Quality Assurance Unit (or 
designee), or to health authority inspectors after appropriate notification. The verification of the 
eCRF data must be by direct inspection of source documents. 
17.4 Electronic Case Report Forms 
Clinical study data for this study will be captured on eCRF. The investigator agrees to provide 
all information requested on the eCRF in an accurate manner according to instructions provided. 
eCRFs are designed for computer processing and analysis. The investigator should ensure the 
accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to Kadmon in the eCRF and in all 
required reports. 
An eCRF is required to be submitted for every subject who receives any amount of study drug. 
This includes submission of retrievable data on subjects who withdraw before completion of the 
study. If a subject stops treatment or terminates from the study, the dates and reasons must be 
noted on the eCRF.

18 MONITORING THE STUDY 
It is understood that the responsible Kadmon monitor (or designee) will contact and visit the 
investigator regularly and will be allowed on request to inspect the various records of the study 
(eCRFs and other pertinent data), provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in 
accordance with local requirements. 
It will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of 
the data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports and 
other subject records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF. The investigator (or designee) 
must agree to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of 
these monitoring visits are resolved.

19 CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDY DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT RECORDS 
The investigator must ensure that subjects' anonymity will be maintained and that their identities 
are protected from unauthorized parties. On eCRFs or other documents submitted to Kadmon, 
subjects should be identified by an identification code and not by their names. The investigator 
should keep a subject enrollment log showing codes, names, and addresses. The investigator 
should maintain documents not for submission to Kadmon (e.g., subjects' written consent forms) 
in strict confidence.

20 PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS 
The results orthis study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. The investigator 
agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Kadmon for review at least 30 days before 
submission. This allows Kadmon to protect proprietary information and to provide comments 
based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the investigator. 
In the event that Kadmon coordinates a publication or presentation of study results from all study 
sites, the participation of investigator or other representatives of study site as a named author 
shall be determined in accordance with Kadmon policy and generally accepted standards for 
authorship.

Appendix C: Relative Physician's Global Assessment 
The relative PGA documents the physician's assessment of the subject's psoriasis status. 
Consideration should be given to the percent of body involvement as well as overall induration, 
scaling, and erythema. The PGA is assessed relative to baseline condition and is defined as: 
(1) = clear, (2) = excellent, (3) = good, (4) = fair, (5) = poor, and (6) = worse. The following 
table further defines the rating. 
Rating % Clearing Definition of Response 
1 = Clear 100% clear Some residual pinkness or pigmentation: 
Woronoff s ring may be present. 
2= Excellent 75 to 99% clearing Marked improvement: nearly normal skin 
texture; some erythema may be present. 
3 = Good 50 to 74% clearing Moderate improvement: plaque has cleared to 
point of small scattered papules with normal 
intervening epidermis. 
= 4 	Fair 25 to 49% clearing  Slight improvement: decrease in scaling and 
softening of plaque. 
5 = Poor 0 to 24% clearing Little or no change in scaling, erythema, or 
plaque elevation. 
6 = Worse Worse

Appendix F: Clinical Adverse Events: Determining Relationship to Study Drug 
1 	NOT RELATED 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration, are clearly felt to 
be due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.) that are unrelated to the administration of 
study drug. 
2 	UNLIKELY RELATED (must have first 2) 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration, are felt unlikely to 
be related to the administration of the study drug. The relationship of an AE to the study drug can 
be considered unlikely if: 
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
• It could readily have been a result of the subject's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It does not follow a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
• It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re-administered. 
3 	POSSIBLY RELATED (must have first 2) 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration, are felt unlikely to 
be related to the administration of the study drug, but the possibility cannot be ruled out with 
certainty. The relationship of an AE to the study drug can be considered possible if: 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
• It could readily have been a result of the subject's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
4 	PROBABLY RELATED (must have first 3) 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration, are felt with a high 
degree of certainty to be related to the administration of the study drug. The relationship of an AE 
to the study drug can be considered probable if: 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
• It could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject's clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction in dose.* 
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug.

5 	DEFINITELY RELATED (must have first 3) 
This category applies to those AEs, which, after careful medical consideration, are felt to be 
related to the administration of the study drug. The relationship of an AE to the study drug can be 
considered related if: 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or drug levels have 
been established in body fluids or tissues. 
• It could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject's clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction on dose and appears upon 
rechallenge.* 
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
*There are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug 
relatedness clearly exists.

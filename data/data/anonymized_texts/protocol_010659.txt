Protocol Number  TS-102 
Protocol Short Title  EPOCH 
Protocol Title  A Phase III Clinical Trial Evaluating TheraSphere in Patients with Metastatic 
Colorectal Carcinoma of the Liver who have Failed First Line Chemotherapy  
Device  TheraSphere, Yttrium -90 glass microspheres  
In the Europe an Union , TheraSphere has been CE marked  for the treatment of 
hepatic neoplasia.  
TheraSphere is currently approved in Canada for treatment of hepatic 
neoplasia in patients who have appropriately positioned arterial catheters.  
TheraSphere is currently approved for commercial distribution in the U nited 
States under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) for use in radiation 
treatment or as a neoadjuvant to surgery or transplantation in patients with 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who can have placement of 
appropriately positioned hepati c arterial catheters.  The device is also indicated 
for HCC patients with partial or branch portal vein thrombosis/occlusion, when 
clinical evaluation warrants the treatment.  
Standard -of-Care 
Chemotherapy  All patients will be treated with standard -of-care  second line chemotherapy 
consisting of either an irinotecan -based regimen, or an oxaliplatin -based 
regimen.  The addition of  biological agents  approved  for use  in the second- line 
setting  of mCRC treatment  to date  (bevacizumab, cetuximab,  panitumimab, 
aflibercept , ramucirumab ) is permitted .  
The biological agents  are administered at the investigator discretion , per local 
practices  and according to the approved label s which determine the target  
patient population  and define the full prescribing information.      
Type of Protocol  Phase  III 
Protocol Design  This is a n open -label, prospective, multi -center, randomized clinical trial.   
Study  Objective  The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TheraSphere 
in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer of the liver  who have progressed 
with first line chemotherapy.  
Primary Endpoint s Progression -Free Survival (PFS)  according to RECIST Criteria v.1.1 from time of 
randomization  
Hepatic Progression -Free Survival (HPFS) , defined as the time from 
randomization to the date of disease progression in the liver  according to  
RECIST 1.1,  or death.  
The study will be considered to have met its objective if at least one of the 
primary endpoints is statistically significant.  
Secondary Endpoints  • Overall Survival (OS) Time, calculated from randomization to death.  
 
• Time to symptomatic progression  (TTSP) from the time of randomization 
to assessment of ECOG performance status  >2. Deterioration in 
performance status is to be confirmed at one subsequent evaluation 8 
weeks later.  
• Objective Response Rate  (ORR):  per RECIST criteria v 1.1  
• Disease Control  Rate  (DCR) : per RECIST criteria v 1.1

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      •  Quality of Life  Assessment : Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – 
colorectal cancer (FACT -c).  
• Adverse events and reportable serious adverse events  as defined by the 
study protocol (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events; CTCAE 
v. 4.0).   
Trial Population  Patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) of the liver who have 
disease progression with first line chemotherapy either; 1) an oxaliplatin -based 
regimen, or 2) an irinotecan -based regimen, and who are eligible for second 
line chemotherapy with t he alternate chemotherapy regimen.  
Number of Patients  Approximately 420 randomized patients are plan ned . 
Number of Sites Up to 100 sites in the United States , Canada , Europe  and Asia 
Treatment  Groups  For all patients , all chemotherapy, including biological agents  (i.e. VEGF 
inhibitors  or others ), must be stopped at least 14 days prior to starting 2nd line 
chemotherapy and 28 days prior to the administration of TheraSphere.  
Patients randomized to the Treatment  Group must initiate 2nd line 
chemotherapy, within  a maximum of 21 days of randomization . TheraSphere is 
to  be administered in place of the second  chemotherapy cycle.   Biological 
therapy can be added for patients randomized to the Treatment Group , 2 
weeks after the Ther aSphere administration ( i .e. with the next cycle of the 
standard -of –care chemotherapy).  
(Note:  For the purpose of this study , one cycle is defined as a chemotherapy 
infusion. ) 
Patients  randomized to the Control G roup will initiate 2nd line chemotherapy 
within  21 days of  randomization . Biological agents  can start with the  first cycle 
of second line chemotherapy for patients randomized to the control group.  
Trial  Duration  Approximately 60 months of accrual and 1 year additional follow -up are 
planned.   
Note: the sample size calculation, in terms of the number of patients, is based 
on an accrual period of 36 months and 12 months of additional follow -up.  
However, since the timing of the interim and final analyses is based on the 
number of PFS events, the inc rease in the forecasted accrual period to 60 
months, does not increase the number of patients required, or affect the 
statistical power of the study.

control  rate (DCR)  will be based on imaging evidence of disease progression.  
Patients will have baseline images  for disease assessment taken  within 28 days 
prior to randomization  and every 8 weeks from randomization (+/ - 1 week) 
during the study to evaluate disease progression .  A confirmatory image at the 
next subsequent visit following progression is required  and may be scheduled 
outside of the 8 -week window. In addition  to the confirmatory scan ,  all 
images performed according to the local standard practices should be collected  
until hepatic progression is confirmed. These images do not have to conform to an 8 -week schedule.  All disease assessment images including the baseline 
images must be assessable according to RECIST 1.1.  Baseline images conducted 
in the course of standard -of-care clinical manage
ment may be used if the 
images conform to RECIST 1.1 and are taken after, or at the time of completion 
of first line chemotherapy. All imaging studies from baseline  to  progression

• CRC Tumor Marker: Serum CEA 
ECOG Performance Status   
Statistical Plan and 
Sample Size Calculation  This study is  an adaptive trial using a group sequential design  with PFS and 
HPFS as the  primary endpoint s.  The study could be stopped early for efficacy 
at an interim analysis based on superiority in PFS  but not HPFS .  
The study is designed to detect a 2.5 month  increase in median PFS time, from 
6 months in the control  arm to 8.5 months in the TheraSphere arm (ie, hazard 
ratio  [HR]   = 0.71), and a 3 .5 mont h increase in median HPFS time, from 6.5 
months in the control arm t o 10 months in the TheraSphere arm (ie, HR = 
0.65 ), using log rank test s.   
The analysis of PFS will be  based on a group sequential design with 2 interim 
analyses  and rho family error spending function stopping boundary with 
rho=1.5. It is estimated that approximately  420 patients will need to be 
recruited over 3 6 months, with a 1 year additional follow -up period, allowing 
for 10% of patients lost to follow -up and for whom a date of progression or 
death is not recorded.   Although the forecasted accrual period has been 
increased to 60 months, this does not increase the number of patients 
required, or affect the statistical power of the study  since both the power and 
the timing of the interim and final analyses are based o n the number of PFS 
events  rather than the number of patients.   The Hochberg procedure 
(Hochberg, 1988) will be used to control Type I error for the two primary 
endpoints  at the final analysis .   
A simulation study, assuming that PFS and HPFS have a correl ation between 
0.3 and 0.8, showed  that the power to detect the target  difference in either 
median PFS (ie, HR=0.71) or median HPFS  (ie, HR=0.65) is >90% , and t he power 
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 13 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      to detect the target difference in PFS or HPFS alone is >80% .   The simulation 
study also demonstrated control of Type I error.  
Analysis of primary endpoint s:  
PFS and HPFS will be compared between treatment arms using log- rank test s at 
an overall one -sided alpha level of 0.025, to test the null hypothesis that the 
hazard rates for the treatment and control arms are equal versus the 
alternative hypothesis that the hazard rate for the TheraS phere arm is less 
than the hazard rate for the control arm , ie,  
H0: λT = λC   versus H 1:  λ T < λC,  
where λT and λC represent the PFS or HPFS hazard rates for the Thera Sphere 
and control arms respectively .  The hazard ratio and two -sided 95% confidence 
limits  for the treatment effect will be computed.  Kaplan -Meier curves will also 
be produced.   Log rank tests converted to z -scores will be used to compare the 
primary endpoints between the treatment arms.  
Interim Analys es of primary endpoint  of PFS :  
The first  interim analysis is planned at 1 72 PFS events .  PFS will be compared 
between treatment arms using a log rank test  converted to a z- score and 
compared to the nominal critical value of 2.372 based on the rho family error 
spending function corresponding to a one-sided p- value ≤0.0088 allowing the 
study to be stopped early for efficacy, in which case HPFS will b e tested at the 
same boundary as PFS   using a log rank test converted to a z- score .  
A second interim analysis is planned at 2 41 PFS events, where PFS will be 
compared between treatment arms using a log rank test converted to a z -score 
and compared to the nominal critical value of 2.3 30 based on the rho family 
error spending function corresponding to a one-sided p- value ≤0.0099 allowing 
the stu dy to be stopped early for efficacy .  If the study is stopped early for PFS 
at the second interim analysis , HPFS will be tested using the boundary derived 
based on an incremental alpha of 0.0057.  This boundary will account for the 
correlation between the z -score for HPFS at the first interim analysis and the z -
score for HPFS at the second interim analysis , which is determined by the 
observed number of HPFS events at the first interim analysis and t he 
cumulative number of HPFS events observed at the second interim analysis .    
At each of the interim analyses, i f the  conditional power for both PFS and HPFS 
is less than  15% the study could be stopp ed early for futility.

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      Final Analysis  of primary endpoint s of PFS and HPFS :   
The final analysis  is planned at 3 44 PFS events. The Hochberg procedure 
(Hochberg, 1988 ) will be used to control Type I error for the two primary 
endpoints.  Whichever of PFS or HPFS  that has the larger p -value, will be 
compared between treatment arms using a log rank test converted to a z -score 
and compared to the nominal critical value of 2. 312 with  a corresponding  one-
sided p- value ≤0.0104  required to declare a statistically significant 
improvement in hazard rate for this endpoint .  To ensure that Type I error is 
controlled  for both primary endpoints , this boundary is based on the 
incremental alpha of 0.0104 instead of the  p-value scale boundary of 0.0168, 
using the rho family error spending function with rho=1.5.   
According to the Hochberg procedure, i f the primary endpoint with the larger 
p-value is statistically significant then the other  primary endpoint is also 
statistically significant .  However, i f the primary endpoint  with the larger p -
value is not statistically significant then the other primary endpoint will be 
compared between treatment arms using a log rank t est converted to a z -score 
and compared to the nominal critical value of 2.562 based on the rho family 
error spending function, with  a corresponding one -sided p -value ≤0.0104 /2 = 
0.0052 required to declare a statistically significant improvement in hazard rate 
for this endpoint .   
 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoint s: Comparison between treatment 
groups for all secondary endpoints will be conducted at the final analysis at 
α=0.0 25 (one-sided ), only if both of the primary endpoint s are  statistically 
significant, with study- wise Type I error controlled using a sequentia l 
hierarchical approach , according to the following orde ring of secondary 
endpoints : OS→  TTSP →ORR→DCR→TTDQoL . 
Time to event endpoints (ie, OS, TTSP , TTDQoL ) will be compared between 
treatment arms using a log-rank test.  Disease control rates and ORR will be 
compared  between treatment arms using the continuity adjusted Newcombe-
Wilson test .  The FACT- c score will be compared between treatment arms  using 
a mixed linear model with baseline score and the relative time from baseline as 
covari ates.  
Safety Analysis : All patients who received study treatments at least o nce will be 
included in the safety analysis. All a dverse events will be reported according to  
the NCI grades and coded using the Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities 
(MedDR A). The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events ( events which 
were not present at baseline or worsened in severity following the start of 
treatment) will be summarized according to MedDRA primary system -organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) . Laboratory values will be summarized by 
treatment group over time and overall.  
A feasibility safety assessment will be conducted after the first 20 patients in

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      the Treatment group  have received both TS and chemotherapy.  
Poolability : As a sensitivity analysis, to address the poolability of data across 
regions, study sites and gender, a Cox regression analysis of the primary 
efficacy endpoint s, PFS  and HPFS , will be conducted including additional factors 
of region, study site and gender, and to determin e the impact of these factors 
on PFS  and HPFS .  If the poolability of PFS and HPFS results is in direct question 
as a result of this sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint s (PFS  and HPFS ) will 
also be analyzed separately by region, site or gender.  In addition, the primary 
endpoint s (PFS  and HPFS ) will be analyzed separately by US and non- US region.  
Screening/Baseline 
Test Period  Patients  with colorectal cancer liver metastases who have progressed with a 
first line chemotherapy regimen (either oxaliplatin -based or irinotecan -based 
regimen) , and are eligible for a standard -of-care second line regimen may be 
screened for inclusion into this study.  The baseline tests should be performed  
within  14 days prior to randomization. Results of tests condu cted in the course 
of standard -of-care clinical management  taken within the baseline period may 
be used.  
Evaluations include:   
• Baseline images for efficacy assessment will be taken within 28 days 
prior to randomization.  The baseline disease assessment im ages must 
also have been taken after, or at the time of completion of first line chemotherapy.  Baseline disease assessment images must have 
measurable target tumors in the liver and  be assessable according to 
RECIST 1.1.   Informed Consent (before any study required tests are 
performed), 
 
• Physical examination,  
• Medical history,  
• ECOG assessment of performance status,  
• Quality of Life Questionnaire (FACT -C), 
• Laboratory blood tests , including serum CEA 
• Baseline chest/abdomen/pelvis  images  to assess liver tumor 
presentation  and assess tumor burden  
Randomization   Upon meeting eligibility for trial participation in accordance with the Eligibility  
criteria, patients will be randomized 1:1 between the Treatment and Control 
group s.  
Prior to ra ndomization , the investigator will decide which chemotherapy 
regimen, including drugs, doses and biological agents , is to be given as second -
line treatment. This planned treatment is to be administered regardless of  the 
arm to which the patient is randomized  (Control or T reatment) . The only 
exception being that  the addition of biological agent s for those randomized to 
the Treatment Group may only begin with  the chemo therapy cycle following 
the treatment with TheraSphere.  
In order to ensure that the treatment group s are balanced , patients will be 
stratified at randomization according to;  the presence of unilobar or bilobar 
disease; oxaliplatin or irinotecan based first -line chemotherapy;  and KRAS

Patients randomized to the Control group or th e Treatment group who are 
unable to receive their planned study treatment will continue to be followed 
under their assigned study group  for the purpose of the intent -to-treat 
analysis.  
The date of screening is the date all screening procedures are completed.  
Initiation of Study 
Treatment and Early 
Treatment Cycles  The chemotherapy regimen, including dose and type of biological agent, must 
be decided and documented prior to randomization.  
Patients randomized to the Control group  must begin standard -of-care second -
line chemotherapy within 21 days of randomization Biological  agents can start 
along with the first cycle of second -line chemotherapy for patients randomized 
to the Control group.  
Patients randomized to the Treatment group must begin standard -of-care 
second -line chemotherapy within 21 days of randomization.  Biological agents 
can be added for patients randomized to the Treatment Group, a minimum of 
2 weeks ( +/- 2 days) after the TheraSphere administration ( i.e. with the next 
cycle of  the standard- of–care chemotherapy).   
TheraSphere 
Treatment Procedure  For patients randomized to the Treatment group, hepatic angiography will be 
performed to assess hepatic vascular anatomy and tumor hypervascularity, 
followed by a 99mTc-MAA scan to rule -out gastrointestinal flow or unacceptable 
lung shunting.  Embolization may be performed, if necessary, to close off 
gastrointestinal flow . These evaluations should be scheduled as soon as 
possible after randomization, but TheraSphere treatment can only take place at least 28 days after the discontinuation of biological agents . 
Patients will not be eligible to receive TheraSphere infusion if the potential radiation dose to the lungs exceeds 30 Gy for a single treatment or cu mulative 
50 Gy or embolization cannot be performed to effectively block GI blood flow 
from the hepatic arterial system. In this case, patients should continue with 
their planned standard- of-care second line chemotherapy treatment.  
In patients with bilobar disease, TheraSphere treatment should be 
administered to both lobes on the same day. In patients with unilobar disease, 
TheraSphere should be administered to the lobe where disease is present. The 
number of infusions required will be determined by the Inve stigator, based on 
the hepatic vascular anatomy. TheraSphere treatment can be performed in the  
inpatient or  outpatient setting.  
Patients will receive a target dose of 120 ± 10% Gy of TheraSphere.  An interval 
of two weeks   after the previous cycle of chemotherapy and two weeks before 
the next cycle  is required .  
For patients randomized to the Treatment  Group , subsequent TheraSphere 
administration to newly observed liver lesions following disease progression is permitted in patients who are amenable to further TheraSphere treatment.  
Second line 
Chemotherapy  The chemotherapy regimen, including dose and type of biological agent, must 
be decided and documented prior to randomization.  
All randomized patients will follow their pl anned second -line treatment 
regimen until disease progression, death or intolerable toxicity  in accordance 
with standard medical practice, including any a djustments to the planned

Trial Visits and  
Follow -up  • Screening and Randomization  
• Every 2 Weeks following randomization:  Patients return to the clinic for 
chemotherapy administration and safety assessment.  Visit activities 
include standard- of-care clinical management laboratory evaluations, 
performance status, recording and assessment  of adverse events, and 
administration of chemotherapy.   
• Every 8 Weeks following randomization  until hepatic progression :  imaging 
for disease assessment (see above)  
• Every  8 Weeks following progression until death or end of study: clinic 
visits for safet y assessment  
Central Image Review  CT/MRI  images will be reviewed centrally prior to the interim and final 
analys es.  The central image  reader will be qualified by training and experience.  
The analysis for the interim and final reports will be based upon the readings of the central reviewer .  In cases of dispute between the site and the central 
reviewer , the central reviewer will prevail . 
Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee  This study will have oversight by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(IDMC) who  will meet as determined to review the enrollment, protocol 
deviations, and safety events.  They will evaluate the data at interim  analyses 
for consideration of stopping the study for overwhelming efficacy or futility. 
The IDMC  will evaluate the final study report .

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      5. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
5.1 GENERAL DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
TheraSphere®  (TS) consists of insoluble glass microsphere s in which yttrium -90 (Y-90) is an integral 
component of the glass. The sphere diameter ranges from 20 to 30 µm with 22,000 to 73,000 
microspheres per milligram. TheraSphere is available in  dose sizes ranging from 3 to 20 GBq 
(typically 3 GBq, 5  GBq, 7  GBq, 10  GBq, 15  GBq and 20 GBq) each s upplied in 0.6 mL of sterile, 
pyrogen- free water contained in a 1.0 mL vial secured within a clear acrylic vial shield. A pre -
assembled single- use TheraSphere Administration Set is provided for each dose. Each user site is 
provided with a re -useable TheraS phere Administration Accessory Kit that provides both radiation 
protection for the user and physical support of the dose vial and Administration Set during 
administration of the product.  
Yttrium -90 is a pure beta emitter which decays to stable zirconium -90 with a physical half -life of 
64.1 hours. The average energy of the beta emissions from yttrium- 90 is 0.9367 MeV with mean 
tissue penetration of approximately 2.5 mm.  
TheraSphere is administered through the hepatic artery which supplies blood to tumor tis sue (the 
portal vein supplies blood to the normal hepatic tissue). The microspheres are trapped in the 
vasculature of the tumor due to arteriolar capillary blockage where they exert a local radiotherapeutic effect. In clinical use, the glass microspheres r emain permanently trapped in the 
vasculature where the isotope decays to infinity leaving background radiation with no therapeutic 
value.  
5.2 GLOBAL REGULATORY STATUS  OF THERA SPHERE  
TheraSphere received a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) from the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 (HDE H980006) and is currently approved for use in radiation treatment or as a neoadjuvant to surgery or transplantation in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who can have placement  of appropriately positioned hepatic 
arterial catheters. The device is also indicated for HCC patients with partial or branch portal vein thrombosis/occlusion, when clinical evaluation warrants the treatment. The current package insert 
approved by the Unit ed States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is provided in Appendix  1a. 
TheraSphere is approved for use in Europe for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia . TheraSphere  is 
approved  in Canada for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia in patients who have appropr iately 
positioned arterial catheters. In addition, TheraSphere is available in South Africa , Turkey , Saudi 
Arabia, Singapore , Hong Kong  and South Korea  for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia.  The current 
package insert s from Canada and Europe are provided in Appendix  1b and 1c respectively.  
5.3 US CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THERA SPHERE  IN PATIENTS WITH 
METASTATIC LIVER CANCER  
Since 2004,  more than 500 patients in the United States with metastatic liver cancer have been 
treated with TheraSphere under a named -patient compassionate use process .  This program was 
terminated in late 2009.  As of October 2009, f ollow -up information for more than 400 patients in 
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 24 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      this program has been reported to the FDA with data for a subset of more t han 190 patients 
published in the literature.  
In addition, a n open -label , single group , Phase II clinical trial in patients with metastatic liver cancer 
was initiated in 2007.   The primary outcome measure of this Phase II study was safety .  Enrollment 
in this study was completed  at 151 patients .  The last patient exited this study on March 30th 2011 
and the data was submitted to the FDA as part of a  Clinical Study Report in September 2011 . The 
safety results from this Phase II trial are consi stent with those reported under the named -patient 
compassionate use program and include fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting and transient laboratory 
abnormalities.  
Early reports of serious adverse events possibly associated with the use of TheraSphere included 
death, hepatorenal failure, liver abscess, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation, 
radiation hepatitis, radiation pneumonitis, duodenal ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding and 
cholecystitis. As clinical experience with TheraSphere increased, the pre -treatment risk factors 
associated with these early serious adverse events  were i dentifi ed, leading to improved patient 
selection criteria , and  thereby lowering the risk of these events occurring. Patients in whom 
TheraSphere should be used with caution inc lude those with infiltrative tumor type, bulk disease 
(tumor volume >70% or nodules too numerous to count), AST  (aspartate transaminase)  or ALT  
(alanine transaminase)  > five times the upper limit of normal, bilirubin > 2 mg/dL, tumor volume 
>50% in the presence of an albumin < 3 g/dL and those in whom extra -hepatic shunting to the 
lungs or gastrointestinal tract cannot be managed through standard angiographic techniques.  
For those patients without the pre -treatment high risk factors noted above, TheraSphere is very 
well tolerated, with treatment administered in an outpatient setting . Hospitalization  for treatment 
effects is rarely require d. The most commonly reported adverse events  associated with 
TheraSphere  are fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and transient laboratory values 
including elevated bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, decreased platelets and lymphocyte 
depression with no clinical sequel ae. 
5.4 RATIONALE  FOR TREATMENT OF LIVER METASTASES SECONDARY TO 
COLORECTAL CANCER  
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed among both men and women 
in the US. The American Cancer Society1 estimates that approximately 148,810 new cases of 
colorectal cancer and 49,960 deaths wer e expected in 2008. Approximately 72% of new diagnoses 
are colon cancer and 28% are rectal cancer.  
Because the liver is the most frequent site of metastases, an estimated 60% of patients who are diagnosed with CRC eventually will experience liver disease as a predominan t site
2. Consequently, 
much of the morbidity and mortality in patients with CRC3 is due to unresectable liver metastases. 
A median overall survival of 44 months and a 5 -year survival rate of 35%4 are associated with 
surgical resection of liv er-confined disease for patients with no evidence of disseminated disease 
with a resection strategy encompassing all liver disease with adequate remnant liver for recovery and medical fitness for laparotomy. However, patients who have liver metastases amen able to 
resection are less than 20% of the population  with metastatic liver disease
5, a rate that may 
improve with current chemotherapy. For the majority of patients without resectable disease, the 
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 25 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      median overall survival is 22 months and rarely is associa ted with survival beyond 5 years6.  
Targeted non -surgical approaches for liver -confined CRC metastases may offer survival advantages 
beyond that of systemic therapy alone.  
TheraSphere was evaluated in a cohort of seventy -two patients7 with unresectable hepatic 
colorectal metastases who were treated at a targeted absorbed dose of 120 Gy with a median 
delivered dose of 118 Gy. The safety and toxicity of TheraSphere was assessed using version 3 of 
the National Cancer Institute Common Term inology Criteria. Response was assessed radio -
graphically and survival estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method from the diagnosis of hepatic 
metastases and first treatment. Treatment- related toxicities included fatigue (61%), nausea (21%), 
and abdominal pa in (25%) with Grade 3 and 4 bilirubin toxicities observed in 9 of 72 patients 
(12.6%). The tumor response rate was 40.3%. The median time to hepatic progression was 15.4 
months, and the median response duration was 15 months. Overall survival from the firs t 
TheraSphere treatment was 14.5 months. Based on sub- stratification analyses, tumor replacement 
(≤25% vs >25%) was associated with significantly greater median survival (18.7 months vs 5.2 
months). The presence of extrahepatic disease was associated negat ively with overall survival (7.9 
months vs 21 months). Overall survival from the date of initial hepatic metastases was 34.6 months. A subset analysis of patients who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status of 0 demonstrated a m edian survival of 42.8 months and 23.5 months from 
the time of hepatic metastases and TheraSphere  treatment, respectively.  The data from this study 
also suggests that patients who have been exposed to fewer than three cytotoxic agents may have 
a better ou tcome than patients who have received all chemotherapy options prior to treatment 
with TheraSphere.   
Based on the subset analyses of this study, it appears patients with good performance status, no 
extrahepatic metastases, liver disease limited to ≤25% of  liver volume, who have not received all 
available lines of chemotherapy may benefit most from treatment with TheraSphere.  We 
therefore propose to evaluate the outcome of these patients when TheraSphere is added to 
second line standard -of-care chemotherap y.  
The most recent N ational Comprehensive Cancer Network (N CCN ) Clinical Practice Guidelines in 
Oncology 8(NCCN - Colon Cancer V. 3.2015 - COL-C – Appendix 3 ) note that current 
chemotherapeutic options for the treatment of colorectal cancer , may include but  are not limited 
to, fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, tyrosine kinase inhibitors , as well as vascular 
endothelial growth factor - and epidermal growth factor -targeting agents.  Section COL -7 of these 
guidelines recommends the various combinations of these agents that should be used in the first 
or second line treatment of colorectal cancer.  Typically, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are treated with either an Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan based regimen as first line chemotherapy, with or wi thout the addition of bevacizumab, cetuximab or panitumumab.  On progression, patients are 
treated with the regimen they did not receive during first line chemotherapy. Epidermal growth 
factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitors may be added in patients with wildtype KRAS  (V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten 
rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) .  
The result of a recent Phase III clinical trial demonstrated that continuing treatment with 
bevacizumab into second line chemotherapy results in improvements in both PFS and overall survival,  as compared to second line chemotherapy alone, if the patient progressed while receiving 
a bevacizumab containing regimen during first line chemotherapy.

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      A radioembolization device similar to TheraSphere but composed of resin microspheres has also 
been evaluated in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Jakobs10 et al confirmed the mild 
to moderate toxicity profile of Y -90 microsphere radioembolization when they reported no severe 
toxicities, except for one grade 4 treatment -associat ed cholecystitis and two grade 2 gastric ulcers, 
using resin -microsphere radioembolization administered as single -session, whole liver treatment in 
41 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to chemotherapy.  In dose escalation 
studies report ing use of the resin microspheres in combination with oxaliplatin11 based 
chemotherapy and in combination with irinotecan12 based chemotherapy, the authors concluded 
respectively that the maximum- tolerated dose of oxaliplatin was 60 mg/m2 during the first th ree 
cycles of chemotherapy and a maximum -tolerated dose of irinotecan was not reached. In both 
trials, radioembolization treatment was administered within a cycle of chemotherapy with the 
majority of patients experiencing mild to moderate transient toxicit ies.   
In this clinical trial, TheraSphere will be administered  in place of the second cycle of 
chemotherapy , ensuring a 2 week period between the radioembolization and chemotherapy.  
In this clinical  trial, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and li ver only metastases in whom 
second line chemotherapy treatment is planned using either an oxaliplatin -based  or irinotecan -
based chemotherapy regimen , will be randomized (1:1) to either the Treatment Group, where 
TheraSphere will be administered in place of the second  cycle of the planned standard -of care -
second line chemotherapy , or the Control  Group, where patients will be treated with only their 
planned standard- of-care second line chemotherapy. Patients in both groups must receive a study 
treatment, eith er chemotherapy or TheraSphere, within 21 days of randomization.  
One of t he primary endpoint s for this clinical trial is progression free survival (PFS).  The outcome 
assumption s in the Control  group  are from the Phase III study13 that investigated second -line 
FOLFIRI (5 -fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan) with or without panitumumab in 1,186 
metastatic colorectal cancer patients.   
This study met its primary endpoint, with the addition of panitumumab to FOLFIRI showing a 
statistically significant incr eased progression -free survival in wild -type KRAS patients of 5.9 months 
versus 3.9 months for FOLFIRI alone (p=0.004). Panitumumab also resulted in slightly longer   
overall survival in wild -type KRAS patients with 14.5 months in comparison with 12.5 months for 
chemotherapy alone (p=0.115), although this was not statistically significant. Overall response rate 
was higher in the panitumumab arm at 35% compared with 10% in the chemotherapy alone arm.  In contrast, between the two treatment arms for mutant KRA S, there was only a negligible 
difference in progression -free survival (5.0 months for panitumumab versus 4.9 months for 
chemotherapy alone), overall survival (11.8 months for panitumumab versus 11.0 months for 
chemotherapy alone).  There is a wide variation in the outcomes
14,15 reported with  second  line 
chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer, and outcomes in patients with liver only metastases 
have not been reported.   
We have also taken into consideration the recent Phase III trial data by Arno ld et al, demonstrating 
a significant improvement in PFS and overall survival when bevacizumab treatment is continued 
into second line chemotherapy.  In the Arnold study, the median  PFS was 5.7 months in patients 
who progressed on a bevacizumab containing regimen in first line chemotherapy and continued 
with bevacizumab in combination with their second line chemotherapy regimen as compared to a

For our proposed trial, we assume a  median  PFS of 6 months in the control group, and 8.5 in the 
treatment group (hazard ratio [HR]=0.71).    We also assum e a median hepatic PFS (HPFS) of 6.5 
months in the control group and 10 months in the treatment group (HR=0.6 5).  The assumption of 
a median HPFS of 10 months in the treatment group is based on a median H PFS of 9.2 months in a 
study of 23 patients who received second line yttrium -90 resin microspheres16. 
6. STUDY OBJECTIVE   
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TheraSphere in the treatment of 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer of the liver.  
7. STUDY DESIGN  
This is an open- label , prospective, multi -center, randomized, clinical trial . 
Patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma of the liver , who have disease progress ion with  first line 
chemotherapy , and in whom the administration of standard- of-care second line chemotherapy  with  
either  an oxaliplatin -based regimen, or an irinotecan -based r egimen  is planned, are eligible to participate .  
Most patients receive an oxaliplatin -based regi men during first line chemotherapy , therefore it is 
expected most patients will be receiving an irinotecan -based regimen as their standard- of-care second 
line regimen while they participate in this trial .  However some patients are expected to receive an 
oxaliplatin -based regimen as their second -line regimen . 
Prior to randomization the investigator will decide which chemotherapy regimen, including drugs, doses 
and type of biological agent  is to be given as part of the second line treatment.  This planned treatment is 
to be administered regardless of the treatment arm to which the patient is randomized (control or 
treatment).  The only exception being that the addition of biological therapy for those randomized to the 
Treatment Group may only begin at the chemotherapy cycle following the treatment with TheraSphere.  
Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1) to either the Control  Group  or the Treatment  Group , defined as 
follows:    
Treatment  Group :  Patients randomized to the Treatment  Group  will be treated with TheraSphere 
administered  in place of  the second  cycle of their standard -of-care second line chemotherapy  regimen .    
Subsequent chemotherapy must not begin until a minimum of two weeks  (+/- 2 days)  after the 
TheraSphere has been administered. Treatment with first  cycle of chemotherapy  must begin within 21 
days of randomization.  
Control  Group :  Patients randomized to the  Control  Group  will receive  only their planned standard- of-care 
second line chemotherapy  regimen . Treatment with chemotherapy must begin within 21 days of 
randomization.  
The addition of approved biological agents (bevacizumab, cetuximab,  panitumimab, aflibercept , 
ramucirumab ) is permitted and should be administered at the investigator discretion per local practices, 
to the  approved targeted population per label.   Biological agents  can be resumed for patients randomized 
to the Treatment Group 2 weeks after the Ther aSphere administration (i.e . with cycle  2 of the standard -
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 28 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      of-care chemotherapy).   Standard of care b iological agents can start along with the first  cycle o f second  
line ch emotherapy for patients randomized to the C ontrol group.  
Patients will have regular clinical  study visits as long as they participate in the trial .  During these visits , 
safety and efficacy data will be collected and recorded .   
The primary efficacy endpoi nts of the trial will be PFS  and HPFS .  Once a patient has progressed, he/she 
will have reached the primary efficacy endpoint s of the trial, but the patient will be encouraged to remain 
on the trial for evaluation of the secondary endpoint of survival.   
Following disease progression, patient s in either group may receive the Best Alternative Therapy or Care 
for further treatment of their  disease .  For patients randomized to the Treatment Group, TheraSphere will 
be provided to patients amenable to further t reatment with TheraSphere.

QOL assessments may be performed remotely for those patients unable or unwilling to come 
into clinic every 8 weeks following progression.  
9.2.13  RANDOMIZATION (STUDY DAY 0) 
Patients will be randomized 1:1 to study treatment, either the Contro l group  or the Study 
Treatment  group .  Approximately 210 patients will be randomized to each protocol  group .  
The date of screening is  the date  that all screening procedures are complete.  
If a patient is determined to be eligible to participate in the trial, the study site will contact 
the central randomization office where r andomization will be determined using assignment 
by a computer -generated randomization scheme.  Upon randomization, each patient will be 
assigned a subject identity code  consisting of the protocol number, the country code (e.g. 
01), the site number (e. g. 01) and a patient number ( e.g. 001).   
In order to ensure that the study treatment group s are  balance d, patients will be stratified at 
randomization based on the following:   
• Unilobar vs bilobar disease  
• Oxaliplatin vs Irinotecan based first -line chemotherapy 
• KRAS status  (wild type  vs mutant)  
Prior to randomization , the investigator will decide t he most appropriate treatment for  
his/her patient including  the chemotherapy regimen , with or without biological agent that is 
to be given as second  line treatment.  
Additional factors permitting covaria te analysis will be captured at randomization but will 
not be stratification criteria. These factors will be defined based on the planned covaria te 
analyses.  
Patients randomized to the Study Treatment  group who are unable to receive their planned 
study treat ment will continue to be followed under their assigned study group  for the 
purpose of the intent -to-treat analysis.  
If a patient  being screened  is found ineligible for the study,  the patient will not be 
randomized and the reason for treatment ineligibility  should be documented on the Screen 
Failure Log.   
All patients deemed eligible for the study must have a minimum washout of 14 days from  
completion of treatment with  their first line agents including any biological agents  (such as  
VEGF inhibitors ) prior to commencing their second line chemotherapy treatments. 
Additionally , patients in the Study Treatment arm must have a minimum washout period of 
28 days from any biological  agent  prior to receiving TheraSphere.

9.2.14.1     THERASPHERE  
TheraSphere will be administered in place of the second  cycle of chemotherapy.  
Patients with unilobar disease will receive treatment of the diseased lobe. Patients with 
bilobar disease will receive treatment to both lobes  separately, administered  during the 
same treatment session.  Any type of biological agent  (such as VEGF inhibitors ) must be 
discontinued for at least 28 days prior to treatment with TheraSphere.  
9.2.14.2  THERASPHERE  PRE-TREATMENT EVALUATION  
Patients random ized to the Study Treatment  group  must undergo the following 
evaluation s in order to determine eligibility to receive the TheraSphere .  These tests are 
described in detail in Appendix 2 , pages 1254- 1255 and include:  
• Hepatic Angiography : selective celiac an d superior mesenteric arteriograms are 
needed to evaluate the hepatic arterial anatomy for the whole liver, as well as evaluation of potential sources of extra -hepatic blood supply to tumors.  The 
goal is to identify, within the hepatic vascular anatomy, a  catheter placement 
location that allows a single TS infusion throughout the lobar tumor volume without administration of microspheres to extra -hepatic structures.  A 
technetiu m-99m macroaggregated albumin (
99mTc-MAA) scan is used to assess 
the potential f or shunting microspheres to the lungs  as well as the  potential for 
the deposition of microspheres to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract . Repeat 99mTc-
MAA may be needed  for subsequent treatments  to estimate cumulative lung 
shunt or re -asses GI flow.   Note that 3 technical factors, as discussed in 
Appendix 2 (time between administration of 99mTc-MAA  and the scan, 99mTc-
MAA  particle size and the presence of free 99mTc-MAA ) can lead to an over -
estimation of shunting to the lungs and should be controlled.  
TheraSphere should not be administered to a patient randomized to the treatment  
group  if: 
• Depositio n of microspheres to the GI tract that cannot be corrected by 
placement of the catheter distal to collateral vessels or the application of  
standard angiograp hic techniques, such as coil embol ization  to prevent 
deposition of microspheres in the GI tract.  
 
• Exposure  of ra diation to the lungs of  30 Gray ( Gy) for a single infusion or a 
cumulative 50 Gy limit for all infusions of TheraSphere  - estimated during 
TheraSphere dose calculation as described in Section  9.2.14.1.3.  
 
In the event that the patient is determined not to be suitable and/or cannot be  safely  
treated with TheraSphere, that patient should continue with the planned second -line 
chemotherapy  treatment  as described in Section  9.2.14.2.

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      9.2.14.3  THERASPHERE  ADMINISTRATION STRATEGY  
For patients eligible to receive TheraSphere, the administration strategy (choice of 
artery position to infuse the target vascular bed; selection of pla cement of coil 
embolization or other techniques used to prevent microsphere deposition to the GI tract) should be determined as discussed in Appendix 2 , pages 1254 -  1257.   Dosimetry 
is based on the volume of the target vascular bed supplied by the artery selected for infusion .  Patients requiring coil embolization to prevent microsphere disposition to the 
GI tract should undergo this procedure during TheraSphere work -up.   
Since the treatment approach for TheraSphere  is lobar  or selective , proper imaging and 
volume calculation is essential for dosimetry purposes.  The ability to understand hepatic anatomy relies on the sound understanding of the Couinaud hepatic 
segments
18.  Anatomically, the middle hepatic vein separates the right and left lobes.  
When dra wing regions of interest and calculating lobar volumes, it is the middle hepatic 
vein that should be used as the anatomic delineator between the right and left lobes.  If 
the middle hepatic vein cannot be seen, then the gallbladder and its axis relative to  the 
liver can be used.  This technique assumes standard arterial anatomy with single right and left hepatic arteries. If variants are observed angiographically, for example, an 
accessory right hepatic artery, then accurate angiographic correlations must b e 
performed when drawing the regions of interest for lobar or segmental lobar volumes.  This will ensure that accurate volumes are obtained and 3 or more infusions are administered.  The volume that needs to be used for TheraSphere dosimetry is that 
volume  of liver that is perfused by the vessel that will be infused.  
Target liver mass is determined by the positioning of the delivery catheter in the hepatic vasculature and the resulting liver area (segments) infused.  Since there is considerable individual variation in hepatic vascular anatomy, the determination of targ et liver mass 
will depend on the variant encountered.  The Table below presents the most commonly 
encountered variants with the corresponding segments associated to them.

9.2.14.4 THERA SPHERE DOSE DETERMINATION  
The screening angiogram and 99mTc-MAA  scan are used to determine lobar liver volume 
from CT or MR I images, to identify vascular shunting  to the gastrointestinal tract 
requiring use of angiographic occlusion techniques and to determine the lung shunt 
fraction . The target dose is 120 Gy ± 10%.  
Calculation of Lung Shunt Factor :  Lung shunt factor is determined from the 99mTc-MAA  
scan using th e following equation:  
Lung shunt Fraction (F) = total lung counts/  (total lung+ liver counts)  
Calculation of Target Liver Mass:  Convert the target liver volume to mass assuming a 
conversion factor of 1.03g/cm3.   
 
Calculation of Activity required to deliver the desired dose of 120 G y: 
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      The amount of radioactivity required to deliver the desired target dose (120 Gy) to the 
selected liver target , adjusted for the estimated fraction that will be shunted to the lung, 
is calculated using the following formu la:  
Activity Required (GBq) = [ Desired Dose  (Gy)] [Mass of Selected Liver Target (kg )]  
50[1 -F] 
Calculation of estimated lung  radiation exposure (Gy) : 
Lung Dose (Gy)  per infusion = 50 * Calculated Activity in GigaBecquerel  (GBq) * F  
Cumulative exposure is  the sum o f estimated exposure per infusion for all planned 
infusions.  
9.2.14.5  THERA SPHERE DOSE VIAL SELECTION  
Selection of the dose vial size to supply the required activity (GBq) for delivery of the 
desired target dose to the selected  target liver volum e via the selected vascular route  is 
dependent on the day and time of the scheduled patient treatment and must account for the time zone in which the hospital is located and the decay in radioactivity over 
time. The impact of time for standard  dose sizes is illustrated in the decay curve  below.  
The TheraSphere Treatment Window Illustrator can be used to select the appropriate 
dose vial or combination of dose vial(s) required to deliver the calculated activity 
required.

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      9.2.14.6   THERA SPHERE ORDERING  
Orders must be placed using the study- specific order form provided by the sponsor . 
Most standard dose vials are made to stock and can be ordered at any time per current 
institutional practices.   Shipment will be arranged according to specified treatment ti me 
as per current practice.   TheraSphere will be delivered to the institution’s designated 
radiopharmacy  and handled according to institutional practices .  
Each vial of TheraSphere will be shipped with a packing slip, a copy of which must be transferred to  the study coordinator for device accountability so that the vials used can 
be tracked to the  specific infusion(s) for each  patient.  Disposal of used or any unused 
vials will be handled in accordance with hospital standard practices for disposal of 
radioactive materials.  
9.2.14.7  THERA SPHERE ADMINISTRATION  
TheraSphere will be administered at a dose of 120 ± 10% Gy to each area being treated,  
administered in one or more selective administrations on the same day.    
Patients in the Study Treatment  group  who h ave hepatic progression with hepatic 
lesions that are still amenable to TheraSphere  are eligible for re -treatment  with 
TheraSphere .  In these cases, TheraSphere may be administered at the investigator’s 
discretion using lobar infusions on separate treatment days.  
TheraSphere should be administered by appropriately trained or designated personnel 
from the departments of Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, and/ or Interventional Radiology.  
TheraSphere administration is generally considered to be an outpatient  procedure in 
the United States. It is generally considered to be an inpatient procedure in Europe. The 
physical location for after -care and recovery will be determined by individual 
institutional policies and facility configurations.  The location and seq uencing of 
treatment procedure may vary depending on the physical location of the angiography and nuclear medicine suites, the availability of portable gamma cameras, and the clinical 
judgment of the physician responsible for the treatment plan.  
On the day of treatment, a n arterial catheter will be placed percutaneously via the 
femoral or brachial artery under image guidance.  The interventional radiologist 
performs this procedure.  The patency of the catheter is maintained by an infusion of 
normal saline a nd a coagulation inhibitor (per institutional protocols) administered via a 
continuous infusion pump. Proper catheter positioning in the selected location in the 
hepatic artery will be verified on angiography before TheraSphere administration.  
Standard me dication protocol for sedation, pain and infection prophylaxis should be 
implemented per established institutional protocols. Prophylaxis with a gastric inhibitor 
(H2 blocker) is recommended to minimize risk of post -treatment gastrointestinal side 
effects.   Although recommended for all patients undergoing treatment, this prophylaxis 
is especially important for patients undergoing TheraSphere treatment to the left lobe 
of the liver, due to the proximity of the gastrointestinal organs, and for patients with a  
prior history of peptic ulcer disease.  Therapy should begin on the day of TheraSphere 
treatment and continue for 14 -21 days following each TheraSphere treatment.

9.2.14.8  THERA SPHERE ADMINISTRATION DOCUMENTATION  
Any technical problems or complications related to the delivery of TheraSphere 
treatment to the patient must be documented in the medical record.  The details of any 
event a nd its impact on the patient should be documented on an Adverse Event e CRF.   
Using institutional practices, the activity of each vial of TheraSphere will be determined 
prior to administration. This activity will be used to calculate t he actual dose deliver ed 
to the liver and lung which will be recorded on the appropriate e CRF. 
 
Calculation of the liver dose (Gy) delivered : 
Calculation of the delivered dose per  infusion takes into account the activity lost to lung 
shunting plus activity associated with residual microspheres in the administration 
system and is provided by the following formula:  
 
Dose (Gy) =  50[Injected Activity (GBq)][1- F][1-R] 
Mass of Selected Liver Targ et (kg)  
where  F = lung shunt fraction (determined in Section 9.2. 14.1.3) 
R = residual fraction (1 -fraction of microspheres delivered)  
Calculation of residual activity fraction for microspheres : 
The fraction of microspheres remaining in the device  is calculated using the following 
formula:  
R = (W-b’) 
(I-b) 
Where   R = residual activity fraction  
b = background dose rate prior to source vial measurement  
I = measured dose rate of source vial positioned greater than 30 cm from 
ionization chamber (or other measuring device)  
b’ = background dose rate prior to waste measurement  
W = average dose rate of shielded waste container (containing discarded vial, microcatheter, tubing) positioned with center in same location as I  
 
Calculation of Actual Lung Radiation E xposure:  
Calculation of the lung dose (Gy) delivered in each infusion is provided by the following formula:  
Lung dose (Gy) = 50* activity delivered (GBq)*F

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      9.2.14.9  THERA SPHERE POST-TREATMENT PATIENT MANAGEMENT  
Immediately following treatment, the patient  should remain under observation 
consistent with institutional standard of care guidelines for aftercare in procedures 
involving femoral or brachial artery catheterization.  These aftercare guidelines are unique and subject to the policies and procedures dictated by the respective radiology 
and radiation safety departments at each institution.  Prophylactic treatment using 
gastric inhibitor (H2 blocker) should continue for 14 – 21 days post treatment. In 
addition, steroids (e.g., Medrol Dose Pack) may be taken (with food) over the first six 
days post -treatment.  
Prior to discharge, patients should be instructed regarding after -care and provided with 
a 24- hour telephone number that they may use to contact the Site Investigator if they 
develop a problem or have  questions about their treatment.  
Any concurrent medication or therapy deemed necessary, including gastric prophylaxis, 
to provide adequate supportive care to the patient in the post -treatment period may be 
administered according to institutional standard  of clinical care and should be 
documented on the Concurrent Medications e CRF.  
9.2.14.10  RADIATION SAFETY IN THE IMMEDIATE POST-TREATMENT PERIOD  
Special radiation isolation procedures for  Study Treatment  group  patients are not 
necessary following TheraSphe re Treatment. The existence of a small amount of long -
lived radioactive byproducts in TheraSphere is a function of the production method19.  
The predomina nt byproducts are Y -91, Y-88 and Cr -51 with respective half -lives of 59, 
107 and 28 days. The 3 year accumulated dose to the patient’s liver is estimated to be 
1/1000 of the planned treatment dose.  
Should a patient die or require surgery in the period immediately following -TheraSphere 
treatment the hospital radiation safety officer should be consulted. At 60 days after the 
TheraSphere calibration date, a surgeon explanting a treated liver in a procedure lasting 
one hour would be exposed to a n estimated  dose to the hands of <0.6mrem . This is  
similar to estimated background doses from natural radiation source s which range from 
0.5 to 0.8 mrem/day. In stitutional radiation safety guidelines for handling of the body 
and/or body tissues should be followed.    
9.2.14.11  SECOND -LINE CHEMOTHERAPY  
The chemotherapy for this trial consist s of either  standard of care second- line 
irinotecan -based  chemotherapy, or standard of care oxaliplatin -based chemotherapy.   
If the patient received an oxaliplatin -based chemotherapy  during first line 
chemotherapy, they should receive an  irinotecan -based  chemotherapy as their second 
line chemotherapy regimen under this protocol.   If the patient received an irinotecan -
based  chemotherapy regimen  during first line chemotherapy, they should receive an  
oxaliplatin -based chemotherapy regimen  as their second line regimen under this 
protocol.

10. STATISTICS  
10.1  SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATE  
This study is a  randomized open label multi -center Phase III adaptive trial using a  group 
sequential design  with primary endpoint s of PFS and HPFS .  The study could be stopped early for 
efficacy at an interim analysis for superiority in  PFS but not HPFS.  
The study is designed to detect a 2.5 months increase in median PFS from 6 months in the 
control arm to 8.5 months in the TheraSphere arm (i.e., hazard ratio  = 0.71), and a 3 .5 month 
increase in median HPFS time, from 6.5 months in the control arm to 10 months in the 
TheraSphere arm (ie, HR =0.6 5), using log rank test s.  
The analysis of PFS will be based on a group sequential design with 2 interim analyses (at 50% and 70% of PFS events) with a  stopping boundary defined by the  rho family error spending 
function  with rho =1.5 (Jennison and Turnbull, 2000
20).  It i s estimated that a maximum of 4 20 
patients will need to be recruited over 36  months, with a 1 year additional follow -up period.  This  
includes an adjustment to take account of an assumed 10% of patients who will be lost to follow -
up and for whom a date of progression or death is not recorded.   The Hochberg procedure23 will 
be used to control Type I error for the two primary endpoints a t the final analysis.  
A simulation study, assuming that PFS and HPFS have a correlation between 0.3 and 0.8, showed 
that the power to detect the target difference in either median PFS (ie, HR=0.71) or median HPFS 
(ie, HR=0.65) is >90%, and the power to detect the target difference in PFS or HPFS alone is 
>80%.   The simulation study also demonstrated control of Type I error.  
Although the forecasted accrual period has now been increased to 60 months, this does not increase the number of patients required, or affect the statistical power of the study  since both 
the power and the timing of the  interim and final analyses are based on the number of PFS 
events  rather than the number of patients.  
 
10.2  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
The statistical analysis plan will be written after the final pr otocol is issued and will be updated, 
as required, in association with any protocol amendments. The plan will include tables, listings 
and graphs and describe statistical programming considerations.

10.2.2  TRIAL ENDPOINTS  
10.2.2.1  PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT S 
The primary study endpoint s are  PFS and HPFS .  The study will be  considered to have met 
its objective  if at least one of the primary endpoints is statistically significant.   PFS is 
defined as the time from randomization until progression , as defi ned by RECIST v 1.1 , or 
death , and HPFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease 
progression in the liver according to  RECIST 1.1, or death . For this protocol , the minimum 
time from baseline to establish Stable Disease is 6 to 8 weeks , the time to complete a  
minimum of one set of follow -up disease assessment image s from baseline. For patients 
who terminate the study before progression or death, patients will be censored at the date 
the patient is last known alive and not progressed.  
10.2.2.2  SECONDARY STUDY ENDPOINTS  
• Overall Survival  (OS) : OS is defined as the time from randomization until the patient 
dies. 
• Time to symptomatic progression (TTSP ):  TTSP is defined as the time from 
randomization to assessment of ECOG performance status >2. Deterioration in 
performance status is to be confirmed at one subsequent evalua tion 8 weeks later.  
• Objective Response Rate  and Disease Control Rate :  At Baseline, target tumors are 
identified, read and measured for size.  At all subsequent follow -up visits, the target 
tumor will be assessed and  categorized as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response  
(PR), Stable  Disease (SD) , or Progressi ve Disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1 at each time 
point.  Objective Response rates at each time point and Best Overall O bjective

Best Overall Disease Control Rates will be evaluated.   
• Quality of Life:  will be assessed at all visits for enrolled patients using FACT -c. 
Safety : will be assessed at all visits for enrolled patients using v 4.0 of the National 
Cancer Institute’s  Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI: CTAE). All adverse 
events, serious  adverse events , and unanticipated adverse device effects  as defined by 
the study protocol will be collected throughout the duration of the study.  These 
events will be document ed and recorded on the Adverse Event ECRF  using the NCI -
CTCAE  v. 4.0 standards , and will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  
10.2.3  EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
10.2.3.1  PRIMARY ENDPOINT S STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS PLAN 
The efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT and PP populations. Tumor response  
as assessed by a central imaging laboratory blinded to treatment assignment  will be 
used for the primary efficacy analysis. This analysis will be repeated using the 
inves tigator assessment of tumor response  as a supportive analysis of PFS  and HPFS . 
PFS and HPFS will be compared between treatment arms using log rank test s at an 
overall one -sided alpha level of 0.025 t o test the null hypothesis that the hazard rates 
for the treatment and control arms are equal versus the alternative hypothesis that the 
hazard rate for the TheraS phere arm is less than the hazard rate for the control arm , ie,  
H0: λT = λC   versus H 1:  λ T < λC,  
where λT and λC represent the PFS or HPFS hazard rates for Thera Sphere and c ontrol 
arms respectively . The Kaplan -Meier metho d will be used to estimate the PF S and HPFS 
curves in the two treatment arms.  The hazard ratio and two -sided 95% confidence 
limits  for the t reatment effect will be presented .  Log rank tests converted to z -scores 
will be used to compare the primary endpoints between the treatment arms.  
Interim Analysis  of PFS : Two  interim analys es of PFS are planned to be performed by the 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) based on group sequential  stopping 
rules using an alpha boundary defined by the  rho family error spending function with 
rho= 1.5. The first interim analysis is planned at 1 72 PFS events ( progressions or deaths ). 
PFS will be compared between treatment arms using a log rank test converted to a z -
score and compared to the nominal critical value of 2.372 based on the rho family error 
spending function,  corresponding to a one-sided p- value ≤0.0088 allowing the study to  
be stopped early for efficacy , in which case HPFS will be tested at the same boundary as 
PFS  using a log rank test converted to a z- score .   
A second in terim analysis is planned at 2 41 PFS events , where PFS will be compared 
between treatment arms using a log rank test converted to a z- score and compared to 
the nominal critical value of 2.330  based on the rho family error spending function , 
corresponding to a one-sided p -value ≤0.00 99 allowing the study to be stopped early for 
efficacy.  If the study is stopped early for PFS at the second interim analysis, HPFS will be 
tested using the boundary derived based on an incremental alpha of 0.0057.  This 
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 48 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      boundary will account for the correla tion between the z -score for HPFS at the first 
interim analysis and the z -score for HPFS at the second interim analysis , which is 
determined by the observed number of HPFS events at the first interim analysis and the 
cumulative number of HPFS events observ ed at the second interim analysis . 
At each of the interim analyses, if the conditional power for both PFS and HPFS is less 
than 15% the study could be stopp ed early for futility , using t he method descri bed in 
Proschan et al (2006)21 .   
OS will also be analyzed at the interim analys es. However, no formal stopping rules will 
be performed based on this interim OS analysis.  
Final Analysis  of PFS and HPFS : The final analysis  is planned at 3 44 PFS events .  The 
Hochberg  procedure22 will be used to control Type I error for the two  primary 
endpoints.  Whichever of PFS or HPFS that has the larger p -value,  will be compared 
between treatment arms using a log rank test converted to a z -score and compared to 
the nominal critical value of 2 .312 with a  corresponding one -sided p -value ≤0.0104 
required to declare a statistically significant improvement in hazard rate for this 
endpoint .  To ensure that Type I error is controlled for both primary endpoints, this  
boundary is based on the incremental alpha of 0.0104 instead of the p- value scale 
boundary of 0.0168  using the rho family error spending function with rho=1.5 . 
According to the Hochberg procedure, if the primary endpoint with the larger p- value is 
statist ically  significant then the other primary endpoint is also statistically significant.   
However, if the primary endpoint with the larger p -value is not statistically  significant 
then the other primary endpoint will be compared between treatment arms using a  log 
rank test converted to a z- score and compared to the nominal critical value of 2. 562 
based on the rho family error spending  function, with a corresponding one -sided p-
value ≤0.0104 /2 = 0.0052  required  to declare a statistically significant improvement  in 
hazard rate for this  endpoint.   
Further supportive analyses of the data using the Cox regression model may be 
conduct ed to evaluate the effect of multiple covariates, including the stratification 
factors . 
10.2.3.2  SECONDARY ENDPOINT STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS PLAN 
Secondary study endpoints , with the exception of OS,  will be analyzed only at the final 
analysis to determine the statistical significance, if any between, the Study Treatment  
and Control  groups.  
A hierarchical approach for analysis of secondary endpoints will be employed as shown 
in the figure below. That is, if both primary comparison s are  statistically significant, the 
secondary endpoints will be analyzed in order of the list below and will continue as long as the obtained 1-sided probability is equal to or less than 0.0 25. If a probability of 
greater than 0.0 25 is obtained , the inferential analysis of secondary endpoint s will stop 
and not proceed further down the ordered list. In this manner the overall study alpha is 
protected and no further adjustment for multiplicity of analyses is required.

factors.  
10.2.4  SAFETY ANALYSIS  
The safety analyses will be performed on the SA population.  
All treatment emergent  adverse events ( TEAEs) , defined as events which were not present at 
baseline or worsened in severity following the start of treatment , will be reported according 
to NCI Criteria. The incidence of TEAEs  will be summarized according to MedDRA coded  
primary system -organ class (SOC ) and preferred term (PT). The  summaries will be presented 
overall (severity grades 1 -5), for grade ≥ 3 events and by treatment discontinuation.  These 
summaries will present the number and percentage of patients reporting an adverse event 
for each classification level as well as the number of events reported.  
 Serious adverse events (SAE)  will be tabulated by treatment  group .  
Laboratory values will be summarized by treatment group over time and overall.  
10.2.4.1  FEASIBILITY SAFETY ANALYSIS  
After the first 20 patients in the treatment group  have received TheraSphere followed 
by at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy, a feasibility safety assessment will be conducted.  
The IDMC will review the safety results of both the control  and treatment groups  in an 
unblinded fashion.  The IDMC will take into consideration the established safety profiles 
of TheraSphere, oxaliplatin  based,  and irinotecan based chemotherapy,  as described in 
the package inserts for each product as well as the published literature .  The expected 
high rates of adverse events and death that are associated with disease progression in 
patients with advanced colorectal cancer  will be considered .     
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 52 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      A consideration for adjusting the dose of cytotoxic agents , or other safety 
recommendatio ns, or stopping further enrollment to trial may be made  by the IDMC  if 
there is : 
• an unanticipated patient death definitely or probably related to the sequential 
administration of TheraSphere with oxaliplatin based or irinotecan based 
chemotherapy  
• there is  a pattern of serious toxicity clearly related to the sequential 
administration of T heraSphere  with oxaliplatin  based  or irinotecan based 
chemotherapy .   
Such a toxicity pattern must be clearly different from, or more severe than, what might 
be expected fr om independent administration of the chemotherapy regimens  and 
TheraSphere.  The potential adverse impact of any such pattern of toxicity on the 
survival or well being of the patient should be considered in the context of the safety and outcome expectations  of patients with advanced colorectal cancer . References to 
consider include a Phase I trial of yttrium -90 microspheres in combination with 
oxaliplatin
10 based chemotherapy and a Phase I trial of yttrium -90 microspheres in 
combination with irinotecan11 based chemotherapy , and the experience of TheraSphere 
in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer  and hepatic metastases7.  
10.2.5  POOLABILITY AND OTHER ANALYSES  
The number of randomized patients , the number of patients  treated , the number of patients  
in each analysis population will be summarized. T he number of patients discontinuing from 
active treatments and reasons for discontinuation will be summarized. In the same manner the number of patients discontinuing follow up and reasons for discontinuati ons will be 
reported.  
Listings of reasons for discontinuation from active treatments, from follow up, and reasons efficacy data cannot be evaluated in the PP population  will be also provided.   
Duration of follow up will be described by descriptive statist ics such as median and 
interquartile range.  
Demographic, patient and disease characteristics will be listed and summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics.  
Multi variate  Cox regression analysis of efficacy endpoints will be conducted on stratification 
criteria and other factors such as age, gender, duration of disease prior to randomization  to 
determine the impact of these factors on study endpoints . 
As a sensitivity analysis, to address the poolability of data across  regions, study sites and 
gender, a Cox regression analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint s, PFS  and HPFS , will be 
conducted including additional factors of region, study site and gender, and to determine 
the impact of these factors on PFS  and HPFS .  (NO TE: region and study site will not be 
included simultaneously in the model due to collinearity.)  Should the impact of region, site 
or gender on PFS  and HPFS  be statistically and clinically relevant, the reasons for the 
observed differential treatment effec t, such as patient demographic or clinical 
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 53 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      characteristics, will be investigated and reported.  If the poolability of PFS or HPFS  results is in 
direct question as a result of this sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint s (PFS  and/or 
HPFS ) will also be an alyzed separately by region, site or gender.  In addition, the primary 
endpoint s (PFS  and HPFS ) will be analyzed separately by US and non- US region. The specific 
mechanism of merging low enrolling study sites into virtual sites for purposes of analysis wil l 
be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.    
10.2.6  INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC ) will be established to oversee the 
conduct of the study, will follow the FDA’s Guidance on IDMCs/ DSMBs  and compl y with ISO 
14155.   The IDMC  will meet periodically during the study to review enrollment, protocol 
deviations, and safety events for the study.  In addition the  IDMC will evaluate the data at 
interim analyses for consideration of stopping the study for overwhelming efficacy or futility 
and for sample size re -estimation at the second interim analysis . The IDMC  will make formal 
recommendations to the study Sponsor at the time of the interim analysis and during the 
conduct of the study based on detailed dec ision rules specified in the IDMC charter . An IDMC 
member or designate may act as the study independent medical monitor.  
11. ELECTRONIC DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
11.1 ELECTRONIC DATA COLLECTION  (EDC)  
Data from this trial will be captured on electronic case reporting forms (e CRFs), and will be entered 
into a validated clinical database.  An audit trail will be maintained to document all data changes in 
the database.  Procedures will be followed to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical 
database .  
The i nvestigator will sign and date all indicated places on the e CRFs.  This signature will indicate 
that thorough inspection of the data has been made and will certify that the Site Investigator has 
reviewed and approved the data contained on the forms . 
11.2 DATA MANAGEMENT  
The investigator will e nsure that trial data quality is maintained to current standards of Good 
Clinical Practice and that data are submitted in a timely manner as outlined in the protocol and supporting documentation, including responses to data queries, until the trial is terminated.   
Errors must be corrected in accordance with EDC data entry guidelines.  
12. ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
Adverse experience will be considered synonymous with the term adverse event and vic e versa.  
12.1.1 DEFINITIONS  OF AE/SAE  FOR DRUGS  
Adverse Event (AE)  
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 54 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      An AE is any untoward medical occurrence or undesirable event(s) experienced in a subject  
or clinical investigation subject  that begins or worsens following administration of the study 
drug, whether or not considered related to the treatment by the investigator.  
An undesirable event(s) can be, but is not limited to, symptoms experienced by a subject  or 
objective findings, such as significant clinical laboratory abnormalities.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death;  
• is life -threatening (“life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject  was at 
risk of death at the  time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe);  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• results in a persistent or significant disability/incapa city; or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject  or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the definition above, should also be considered serious.  
12.1.2 DEFINITIONS  OF ADE/SADE/UADE  FOR DEVICES  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Adverse event that:  
• led to a death,  
• led to a serious deterioration in health that either:  
o resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
o resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
o required in- patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, or  
o resu lted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening 
illness or  injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body 
function.  
• led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
NOTE 1:  This includes dev ice deficiencies that might have led to a serious adverse event  if a) 
suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if  
circumstances had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting  system.  
NOTE 2:  A planne d hospitalization for pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by  the 
Clinical Investigation Plan, without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered  to be a 
serious adverse event.

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
An adverse device effect is an adverse event (AE – previously defined) related to a medical 
device  including device procedure and includes but not limited to  any event resulting from  
device deficiencies such as insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the 
deployment, implantation, installation or malfunction of the device; any event that is the 
result of user error . 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
A Serious Adverse Device Effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences char acteristic of a serious adverse event (SAE –  previously defined) .  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect is a ny serious adverse effect which by its  nature, 
incidence, severity and outcome ha s not been identified i n the risk assessment, the informed 
consent for m as well as the protocol.  
12.2 RECORDING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All adverse events  and adverse device effects  will be documented from the date of randomization  
until disease progression or 30 days after discontinuation of the study therapy (second- line 
chemotherapy alone or TheraSphere and second- line chemotherapy), whatever  comes first. After 
this, only adverse events related to TheraSphere will be collected.  
In this study, patients should be encouraged to report adverse events spontaneously or in 
response to general, non -directed questions.  At any time during the study, the patient may 
volunteer information that resembles an adverse event. Once it is determined that an adverse event has occurred, the In vestigator should obtain all the information required to complete the 
adverse event form.  Any medical management of an event and the date of resolution of the event 
must  be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate case reports form(s) using 
medical terminology according to sponsor instructions.  
For each AE , the following information will be recorded:  
• Adverse event  
• Serious/non -serious  
• Severity  
• Action taken  
• Relationship to study treatment  
• Expected/Unexpected  
• Date and time of onset  
• Date and ti me of resolution  
An expected adverse event is any AE, the nature or severity of which is identified in the relevant 
Package Insert or Investigator’s Brochure.  
Any AE experienced by a subject will be  followed until the AE has resolved to the investigator 's or 
physician sub- investigator's  satisfaction  or is considered stable .  If a problem still exists, then the 
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 56 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      investigator or physician sub -investigator  at his/her discretion will ask the subject  to come back to 
the clinic for further evaluation.  Any serious  adverse events should be managed as discussed in 
Section 12.3.  
Once the subject has been discharged from the study, the investigator has no obligation to seek 
further follow- up with the subject  in order to identify new AEs. However, if the investigator 
becomes aware of an SAE that has occurred following the subject's discharge from the study and 
the investigator considers the SAE possibly, probably, or definitely related to a  study drug or 
device , then the investigator s hould report the SAE as described in the protocol.  
Disease progression itself is not to be considered as an AE, but signs and symptoms that led to 
disease progression should be recorded.  If disease progression is due to the primary cancer type 
than this s hould be stated as event term for recorded SAE.  
12.2.1  CAUSALITY (RELATIONSHIP TO DEVICE ) ASSESSMENT  
The i nvestigator or physician sub- investigator must indicate whether he/she  believes  the AE 
is unrelated, possibly related ( reasonable possibility that the investigational device caused 
the AE), probably related, or definitely related to the device .  
The Investigator should pay careful attention to the attribution of relation for all adverse 
events.  Because there are many similar events between the TheraSphere and the second -
line chemotherapy regimen safety profiles, judgment of relation by time of administration 
and patient assignment to treatment or Control group should be considere d. 
An adverse event  becomes an adverse device effect when the adverse event  is considered 
associated with the use of the test device if the attribution is Possibly, Probably or Definitely 
Related .  Relation to TheraSphere (screening, procedure, embolizatio n or radiation) is not 
appropriate for the Control Group.  Only those events with a possible, probable or definitely 
related attribution to TheraSphere will subject to expedited reporting. All other events 
documented in the trial will be addressed through periodic clinical trial  reporting  in the US.  
In the EU all SAEs are subject to expedited reporting.  
12.3 SUBMITTING EXPEDITED SAFETY REPORTS   
Any SAE , SADE  or UADE (defined previously) must be reported by telephone or fax to the sponsor 
or its designate  as specified in the study procedures within 24 hours of learning of the event.  In 
the event of an emergency, the Investigator will contact the CRO using the coordinates  specified in 
the study procedures manual.  
The SAE  form provided by the sponsor should be completed and signed by the investigator or 
physician sub- investigator. The entire SAE form needs to  be completed, if possible, to keep 
requests for additional information to a minimum. Patients experiencing SAE , SADE or UADE  
should be followed clinica lly and with laboratory studies, if appropriate, until medical treatment 
and/or medical monitoring of the event is no longer required because the event resolves or stabilizes, returns to baseline if a baseline value is available, can be attributed to agent s other 
than the study treatments or a referral for appropriate follow -up care has been made.  
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 57 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      The Investigator must promptly inform the IRB of all UADE  and SAE as needed per IRB 
requirements . These events will be reported by the sponsor as appropriate to t he regulatory 
authorities according to relevant jurisdictional medical device regulations. The Investigator will 
receive notification of these events across all study centers from the sponsor.  
Each AE reported on an SAE form must also be reported in the a dverse event section of the e CRF. 
12.4 PERIODIC SAFETY REPORTING  
Adverse events will be recorded on the AE form and coded using NCI CTCAE v 4 .0.  The investigator  
or physician sub- investigator  will judge the severity of each  AE and  whether or not  it is treatment -
related.  All AEs that occur after randomization , including events likely to be related to the 
underlying disease or likely to represent concurrent  illness, will be reported, including events 
present at Baseline which worsened during the trial.   
Periodic safety reports prepared by the sponsor will be distributed across all study centers. The 
Investigator will be responsible for informing the IRB.  
12.5 EXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.5.1  THERA SPHERE ADVERSE EVENT PROFILE  
TheraSphere has been approved for the treatment of HCC since 1999. Adverse events known 
to be related to the device or the procedure listed in the current package insert ( Appendix

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      In addition, the following events, which may or may not be related to the use of 
TheraSphere or the administration procedure, have been reported in clinical trials of 
treatment of primary or secondary liver cancer:  
Abdominal pain, dyspnoea, abdominal distention, anxiety, blurred vision, chills, hot flashes, 
bladder infection, lower extremity edema, gastrointestinal stoma complication including mild pain, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal failure, edema, malaise, he patic

hyponatremia, low serum bicarbonate and low serum chloride . 
12.5.2  SECOND -LINE CHEMOTHERAPY ADVERSE EVENT PROFILE  
The nature and severity of  expected  adverse events associated  with second -line 
chemotherapy will vary depending in part on the drug or combination of drugs used, the 
dosages used and the treatment regimen.  To assist in the assessment of the attribution of 
adverse events to one or more chemotherapy drugs, the Investi gator is referred to the 
current package insert for the respective drug(s) administered . The following summary 
presents a compilation of adverse events associated with second -line chemotherapy 
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer reported in  the liter ature6 and package inserts of 
the relevant drugs .   
FOLFOX CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT TOXICITY PROFILE:  Severe (grade 3 or 4) events include 
neuropathy, diarrhea, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting  (although unlikely 
to be grade 3 or 4) , fatigue an d alopecia (grade 1 or 2). There are two types of peripheral 
neuropathy associated with oxaliplatin -  an acute self- limiting, cold -sensitive peripheral 
neuropathy lasting approximately 3 days and a delayed, cumulative dose dependant sensory 
peripheral neur opathy  which has a median time to reduction or resolution of approximately 
13 weeks after cessation of oxaliplatin therapy.  Rarely, some patients may experience 
anaphylactic reactions or laryngeal paresthesia at infusion which can be addressed through 
extending the infusion time from 2 -6 hours or pre -medication with lorazepam.  Oxaliplatin 
has been associated rarely with pulmonary fibrosis which may be fatal. Increases in 
transaminases and alkaline phosphatase have been observed with oxaliplatin.  
FOLFIRI CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT TOXICITY PROFILE:  Severe (grade 3 or 4) events include 
diarrhea, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia  and nausea/vomiting. The severity of 
irinotecan -induced diarrhea may be greater than that associated with oxaliplatin. The 
incidence of  neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with FOLFIRI may be lower than that 
associated with FOLFOX but may include febrile neutropenia.  Increased numbers of patients 
treated with first -line FOLFIRI, vs FOLFOX, have reported grade 3 or 4 nausea/vomiting. 
Alopeci a (grade 1 or 2) occurs more frequently with FOLFIRI than FOLFOX. Some mild 
changes in liver values , including increased bilirubin, transaminases and alkaline 
phosphatase,  unlikely to cause symptoms have been observed.  
5-FU/LEUCOVORIN CLINICALLY SIGNIFICAN T TOXICITY PROFILE:  Diarrhea, neutropenia and 
mucositis are commonly associated with bolus administration of 5 -FU/Leucovorin. Infusion

13.4 SOURCE RECORDS AND STUDY DOCUMENTATION  
Investigators are requi red to p repare and maintain adequate source documentation.  Source 
documentation includes:  
• documents relative to the patient’s medical history that verify the eligibility  criteria  
• records covering the pati ent’ participation in the study which include but are not limited 
to basic identification information, results of physical examinations and diagnostic tests, 
therapy, device administration, concurrent  medication information and visit/consult 
notes.)  
The Investigator will initial and date all laboratory reports or initial and date statements at each 
study visit that all clinical laboratory data was reviewed.  
Federal regulations  concerning the period during which study records must be maintained by the 
Investigator vary from country to country.  Investigators are required to comply with their local  
regulatory authority for storage of study documentation.   For the purpose of this study the 
minimum retention for Study Documentation is a period of two (2) years after the later of the 
following:   (a) date on which the Study is terminated or completed; or (b) date records are no 
longer required to support a premarket approval application, notice of completion of a product 
development protocol, or other application for research or marketing permit.  
 
Com pleted eCRFs that are dated and signed by the investigator must be made available for review 
and retrieval by the sponsor  or designee at  the time the subject  completes the study.  The sponsor 
or designee will provide the investigator with a copy of completed e CRFs for their files.  
In order to ensure the accuracy of data collected in the eCRFs, it is mandat ory that representatives 
of the sponsor , as well as representatives of a regulatory agency ( e.g.  Food and Drug 
Administ ration) or the institutional review board (IRB), have access to source documents ( i.e., 
subject  records, subject  charts, and laboratory reports).  During the review of these documents, 
the anonymity of the subject  will be maintained with strict adherence t o professional standards of 
confidentiality.  The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study for refusal of the 
investigator to supply source documentation of work performed in this clinical trial.  
13.5 ETHICAL CONDUCT OF TH E STUDY  
This study will be conducted in compliance with standard operating procedures of the sponsor or 
designee, which are designed to ensure adherence to g ood clinical practice (GCP) guidelines as

3. Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 50, 54, 56, and 8 12. 
13.6 RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH  
The Sponsor will ensure that this trial is conducted in full conformity with the current revision of 
the ‘Declaration of Helsinki”, ISO  14155, the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR 812, and 
applicable state and federal regulations, whichever affords the greatest protection to the patient.  The Sponsor is responsible for providing monitoring oversight for the study to ensure the 
involvement of the Investigator in the trial, to ensure the rights, safety and well -being of the 
patients, compliance to the protocol and to all applicable laws, and to oversee the completeness, 
accuracy and consistency of the data collected in support of a pre -market approval application  in 
the United States .  
The procedures defined in the protocol and the eCRFs will be careful ly reviewed by the Sponsor 
with the Investigator and staff prior to time of trial initiation to ensure appropriate interpretation and implementation.  No deviations from the protocol may be made without advance approval 
from the sponsor  and the IRB as required by the policies of the IRB.  
Monitors from the Sponsor, or their designees, will periodically visit the site to review case report 
forms, the Regulatory Binder, patient medical records including electronic records, imaging files, laboratory reports, de vice accountability, site training and authorization of delegation and any 
other records related to the study conduct.  Investigator will maintain and release the records for review, provide access to the records and copies as needed, and will meet with th e monitor as 
needed to discuss study progress and needs.  The Investigator should maintain the files suitable for inspection at any time by a trial  monitor from the sponsor or designee , or the appropriate 
regulatory authority , or designate representing the se organizations.  
 
13.7 INFORMED CONSENT  
An IRB approved signed informed consent form (ICF) must be  obtained from a  patient before that 
patient can enter the trial, and before any study related evaluations can be performed on that 
patient.  
The investigator is responsible for the creation of the ICF and must ensure that the informed 
consent adheres to the U.S Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR 50 , ISO 14155 or equivalent , as 
appropriate to his/her country.   The Investigator will ensure that the local IRB has approved the 
protocol and the informed consent  prior to the initiation of the trial.  The signed informed consent 
from each patient must be kept in the patient ’s study file .   
The investigator or design ee will review the treatment plan with the patient and the patient will 
have an opportunity to ask questions regarding study procedures, the required visit schedule, 
risks/benefits of the use of the device (TheraSphere), and al ternative treatment options p rior to 
signing the ICF.   The patient will receive a copy  of the signed informed consent to keep for their 
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 64 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      records.  Periodically during the study, revisions to the informed consent form may  be need ed.  
Patients will be informed of such revisions and any r evisions  must be signed and kept in the 
patients study file.    
The acquisition of informed consent should be documented in the subject ’s medical record and the 
ICF should be signed and personally dated by the subject  and by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion (not necessarily by the investigator ).   
Patients for whom English is not their first language may need a written translation of the 
document and/or a patient advocate, according to the policies of the IRB.  The Investigator will  
provide  the sponsor or designee  a copy of the IRB approved translation, if any . 
13.8 PATIENT MEDICAL RECORDS  
The Investigator must maintain adequate medical records regarding their care of the patient, including case histories, to support the clinical data in the case report forms.  These records must 
be maintained and made available for monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, or their designee, 
and the appropriate regulatory agency .  All CT/MRIs will be maintained or archived along with the 
medical chart fo r review for at least 2 years after pre -market approval of the device.  
13.9 PATIENT PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
All collected patient data will be treated confidentially and identified only by a patient identification number.  Medical records relating to t his trial, including those that are electronically 
maintained and those that may contain information that would identify an individual patient will remain confidential, but may be reviewed by, released, and/or transmitted to representatives of 
the hospital , the appropriate regulatory agency , Biocompatibles  (the Sponsor) or its agents, and 
the Independent Data Monitoring Committee  when reasonable and appropriate for the conduct of 
the trial.  
As part of the required content of the informed consent, the patient must be informed that his/her 
records will be reviewed by Biocompatibles  and/or a representative of the appropriate regulatory 
agency  and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee . The in formed consent or related 
document will also state that patient privacy will be maintained pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) , 21 CFR 21 or equivalent for countries other than the 
United States .  Should access to th e medical record require a separate HIPAA waiver or 
authorization per institutional confidentially policies, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain 
such permission from the patient in writing before the patient is entered into the trial.  
13.10 ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES  
Additional Investigator responsibilities are noted in ISO 14155 in Section 11 of the US 21 CFR 
812.100, 812.110 and in country- specific guidelines and laws and responsibilities for reporting of 
unanticipated adverse device events and deviations from the investigational plan per 812.150 as 
well as the following:  
• Ensure compliance with  institutional and appropriate relevant jurisdictional  Radiation 
Safety policies and procedures .

Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      • Assemble and coordinate a team that incl udes a designated co -investigator in all of the 
medical disciplines necessary for the efficient conduct of the protocol (oncology, 
interventional radiology, nuclear medicine, diagnostic radiology, etc).  
• Provide a trial coordinator who will be responsible f or assisting the Investigator in 
meeting data collection and reporting requirement and for scheduling, management and follow -up of trial patients.  
• Provide adequate access to study materials for  the sponsor or designee  to monitor the 
trial at appropriate an d convenient intervals and provide an adequate, secure area, within 
the study site facility for a sponsor or  representative to conduct these monitoring 
activities.  
14. PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
It is vital to the success of the study that the investigator adheres to  the details of the protocol . A protocol 
deviation is any change, divergence or departure from the  study protocol in any section related to patient 
regardless the consequences to the patient or study outcomes.   
 
A minor protocol deviation is defined as a divergence from the protocol that is without significant 
consequences to the patient and the study data. An example is  missing a visit window because a patient 
is traveling.   
A major protocol  deviation   is defined as  a divergence from the protocol that materially (a) reduces the 
quality or completeness of the data, (b) makes the Informed Consent Form inaccurate, or (c) impacts a 
subject's safety, rights, or welfare, example:  
 
• Enrollment deviations  
• Eligibility criteria deviations  
• Inadequate informed cons ent 
• Intentional  repeated deviatio ns from the protocol  
• TheraSphere Administration deviations : TheraSphere treatment dose outside the range of  
120 Gy ± 10 % (i.e. 108-132  Gy)   
 
15. STUDY MONITORING  
The study will be monitored by qualified personnel from the s ponsor or a contract research organization 
(CRO) contracted to provide such monitoring by the s ponsor .  Data management and statistical analyses 
will be  the responsibility of the s ponsor  who will contract with one or more organizations to manage 
these func tions.  
Before initiation of the trial, representatives from the sponsor will, together with the investigator, review 
the protocol and the facilities.  At trial initiation, the sponsor's representative will thoroughly review the protocol and go over the eCRFs and electronic data entry procedures  with the investigator(s) and other 
authorized staff.   
mCRC Phase III Protocol  TS-102 
EPOCH , Version 7.0 2017-MAY -10 66 
 
Biocompatibles  CONFIDENTIAL      During the course of the trial, a study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor will visit 
the investigator at suitable intervals.  The purpo se of these visits will be to verify compliance with 
applicable government regulations and adherence to the protocol, ensure correct completion of the 
eCRFs. 
In order to perform his/her role effectively, the study monitor(s) must be given access to source 
documentation (eg, clinic charts, original laboratory records), which support data on the e CRF, and 
informed consent forms.  The monitor must be able to verify data appearing in the e CRFs against data in 
the subject's clinic chart ( eg, chart notes) or in p rintout forms (eg, laboratory results).  
16. STUDY TERMINATION  
Biocompatibles  reserves the right to discontinue this study for administrative reasons at any time.  The 
end of the study is defined as the reaching of the required number of PFS events and all Ther aSphere 
treated patients have been followed -up for a minimum of 30 days from the last TheraSphere treatment, 
and all treated patients in the control arm have been followed -up for a minimum of 30 days after the 
second cycle of second line  chemotherapy .

Study Title  
A Phase 2 t rial evaluating sargramostim in patients with COVID -19 associated acute hypox emia  
Study Center(s)  
Up to approximately  20 sites (US)  
Study Design  
This Phase 2 , randomized , open -label  study will  enroll approximately 120 patients with COVID -
19 associated acute hypoxemia  randomized 2:1  to evalu ate sargramostim treatment  plus 
institutional standar d of care  compared to institutional standard of care  alone .  A Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will review the safety and benefit/risk of sargramostim after 
appr oximately  10 and 20 patients  are enrolled  and complete the sargramostim treatment 
period .  Enrollmen t of patients will be paused until the DSMB has conducted the safety review  
and permitted the study to proceed.   An additional DSMB review will occur after approximately 
60 patients (total of both treatment arms) are enrolled to the study. Upon completion of this 
safety review, the DSMB may request an additional review after approximately 80 patients have 
been randomized. Enrollment will not be paused during these reviews  at approximately 60 and 
80 patients .

Patient population:  
Patients with COVID -19 associated acute hypox emia  
Rationale : 
GM-CSF is a critical cytokine for healthy pulmonary function. Detailed studies have shown that 
GM-CSF is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from fetal monocytes and the 
maintenance of these cells in adulthood (Dranoff, 2017; Gui lliams, 2013). GM -CSF has a wide 
array of effects on myeloid cells. GM -CSF has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor 
that has pleiotropic effects not only in promoting the  differentiation of immature precursors 
into polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic cells, but also in 
controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells (Zhan, 2019). GM -CSF is also known to 
reverse immunoparalysis seen in  sepsis by immune activation, resulting in beneficial outcomes 
(Mathias, 2015; Meisel, 2009). Additionally, researchers have shown that in response to lung 
infection, GM -CSF signals B1a B cells to secrete polyreactive emergency immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) and e nsures effective early frontline defense against bacteria invading the lungs (Weber, 
2014).  
There is evidence that inhaled GM -CSF prevents bacteremia in post influenza bacterial 
pneumonia primarily through locally -mediated improved lung antibacterial resis tance to 
systemic bacteremia during influenza A viral infection (Umstead, 2020; Steinwede, 2011) and 
through increased production of reactive oxygen species by the alveolar macrophages 
(Subramanian, 2014).  Pulmonary delivery of this cytokine has the potent ial to reduce morbidity 
and mortality due to viral pneumonia, potentially to include COVID -19. 
The safety and efficacy of sargramostim 125 mcg has been evaluated in several clinical studies. 
In one clinical study of six patients with moderate to severe com munity -acquired pneumonia or 
ventilator -associated pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 125 mcg of 
sargramostim was administered  by an Aeroneb Solo nebulizer device (Covidien, Neustadt, 
Germany) at an interval of 48 hours for 2 doses (Hero ld, 2014). At this dose, a significant 
improvement of oxygenation in response to sargramostim inhalation (p=0.0035) , with no drug -
related toxicity , was observed.  Inhaled sargramostim has been evaluated at doses higher than 
125 mcg in patients with autoimm une pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) (Wylam, 2006; 
Tazawa, 2019; Campo, 2016).  Patients with aPAP have extremely high titers of anti -GM-CSF 
antibodies, which sequesters native GM -CSF leading to accumulation of surfactant in alveolar 
sacs with resulta nt hypoxia.  To overcome the high anti -GM-CSF antibody levels in aPAP 
patients, sargramostim has been administered at doses of up to 500 mcg total daily dose, 
although daily doses of 125 mcg and 250 mcg have been used and associated with an 
improvement in clinical outcome (Wylam, 2006; Tazawa, 2019; Campo, 2016).  Given the 
demonstrated efficacy of 125 and 250 mcg doses, 125 mcg is considered a minimally effective 
dose when treating viral -related diseases.

Number of Patients:  
Approximately 120: of which 80 patients will receive  sargramo stim + SOC, and 40 patients who 
will receive SOC alone . 
Duration of Therapy  
All p atients randomized to the sargramostim treatment arm will receive sargramostim for the 
duration of treatment and remain on study for the duration of study period, unless  the p atient 
has unacceptable toxicity to sargramostim or patient/ legally authorized decision 
maker /investigator deci des to discontinue  the patient , or patient has r apid deterioration 
requiring other advanced treatments or m edical care not conducive to continued treatment with 
sargramostim .  Patients will receive sargramostim treatment for up to 5 days.  
For the purpose of this study, Day 1 is the day the patient receives the first dose of sargramostim  
and/or SOC . 
Following the sargramostim treatment period (Day 1 -5), patients will continue to receive SOC as 
appropriate following institutional guidelines.  The study period (Days 6 -28) will continue until 
completion of all safety and efficacy asses sments on Day 28 (e nd of study).    
Patients on the control arm will receive institutional standard of care alone.  
All patients, including those who discontinue treatment  early, will be followed for the duration 
of the study period.  
Duration of Follow -Up 
All patients should  be followed for safety evaluations for  up to Day 90.  Data from a  final follow -
up visit at day 90  (+/-30 days)  should  also be collected . 
Duration of Study  
Study completion  will be defined as the date when the last patient completes the follow -up 
period , or has withdrawn from the study .  Alternatively, the study may be stopped earlier for 
reasons such as feasibility, poor enrollment, ethical or safety reasons.  
Test Product/Device, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
All patients randomized to the sargramostim treatment arm will be treated with 125 mcg 
inhaled sargramostim twice daily (with the interval between doses per institu tional practice  for 
twice a day dosing ) for 5 days delivered via a mesh  nebulizer.  
Patients cannot start the study using intravenous (IV) administration of sargramostim.  If  a 
patient cannot continue to receiv e inhaled  sargramostim  upon progression to an invasive 
mechanical  ventilator, administ ration of sargramostim may be delivered by IV infusion to 
complete a total of 5 days (including days delivered via inhalation).  
Patients on the control arm will receive institutional standard of care alone.  
Study Design:  
Randomized  two-arm open -label study

 17 of 46 3 BACKGROUND  
3.1 Sargramostim  
Sargramostim (Leukine) is a recombinant human granulocyte -macrophage colony stimulating factor 
(rhu -GM-CSF), and has been approved since 1991. GM -CSF, a pleiotropic cytokine, is an important 
leukocyte growth factor known to play a key role in hematopoiesis, effecting the growth and maturation 
of multiple cell lineages as well as the functional activ ities of these cells in antigen presentation and cell 
mediated immunity.  Since the initial FDA approval in 1991,  patients have been estimated 
to have received Leukine, providing extensive clinical and post -marketing data in a broad range of 
treated individuals across several disease states.  This includes preterm neonates as well as the elderly, 
including males  and females, representing a well -characterized safety profile for Leukine.  
3.2 Role of GM -CSF in Lung Function  
GM-CSF is a critical cytokine for healthy pulmonary function. Detailed studies have shown that GM -CSF 
is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from fetal monocytes and the maintenance of 
these cells in adulthood (Dranoff, 2017; Guil liams, 2013). GM -CSF has a wid e array of effects on myeloid 
cells. It has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor that has pleiotropic effects not only in 
promoting the differentiation of immature precursors into polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes/ 
macrophages and dendritic  cells, but also in controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells (Zhan, 
2019). GM -CSF is also known to reverse immunoparalysis seen in sepsis by immune activation, resulting 
in beneficial outcomes (Mathias, 2015; Meisel, 2009). Additionally, rese archers have shown that in 
response to lung infection, GM -CSF signals B1a B cells to secrete polyreactive emergency 
immunoglobulin M (IgM) and ensures effective early frontline defense against bacteria invading the 
lungs (Weber, 2014).   In the lung, the al veolar epithelial cells (AEC) -released GM -CSF is known to 
improve the innate immune responses of myeloid cells, in particular the alveolar macrophage ( AM).  It 
has been shown to enhance viral clearance and modulate surfactant lipid metabolism, preventing i ts 
accumulation in the alveoli and maintaining the optimal physiologic gas exchange.  In addition, the AEC -
expressed GM -CSF also has direct beneficial effects on the injured epithelial barrier by orchestrating 
epithelial proliferation and barrier repair  (Subramaniam , 2014; Subramaniam , 2015) . 
There is a large body of evidence generated with GM -CSF in animal studies suggesting the potential use 
in ARDS and infections. For the purpose of brevity, we will point to the data that reflects the potential 
value in viral lung infections and preventing secondary bacterial infections.  
Halstead and colleagues demonstrated that in vivo  high airway levels of GM -CSF profoundly rescue mice 
from lethal influenza pneumonia. While in vitro GM-CSF is canonically described as an M1 -polarizing 
cytokine, their data demonstrated that in vivo , during influenza A virus infection, GM -CSF instead 
temporizes the type II interferon -induced M1 polarization of airway macrophages and reduces 
inflammation induced damage (Halstead, 2018).  Unkel and colleagues demonstrated GM -CSF– 
dependent cross -talk between influenza virus infected alveolar epithelial cells and CD103+ dendritic cells 
is crucial for effective viral clearance and recovery from injury and thu s pointing to the potential use of 
GM-CSF treatment in severe influenza virus pneumonia (Unkel, 2012). Investigations have shown that 
GM-CSF conferred resistance to influenza in mice via alveolar phagocytes and through alveolar 
macrophages which became mor e resistant to influenza - induced apoptosis. Delivery of intranasal GM -
CSF to wild -type mice also conferred resistance to influenza (Huang, 2011).  
There is evidence that inhaled GM -CSF prevents  systemic  bacteremia in post influenza bacterial 
pneumonia pri marily through locally -mediated improved lung resistance during infection (Umstead,

macrophages (Subramanian, 2014).  
In conclusion, GM -CSF confers resistanc e to influenza by enhancing innate immune mechanisms that 
depend on alveolar macrophages, for their health and normal functioning. Pulmonary delivery of this 
cytokine has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality due to viral pneumonia  (Figure 1) . 
 
Figure 1 GM-CSF-modulated immune response to influenza virus infection  (Rosler, 2016) . GM-CSF-modulated immune 
response to influenza virus  infection. After pulmonary influenza virus  infection GM -CSF is released from alveolar epithe lial cell II, 
mediated through HGF/c -Met and TGF -α/EGFR signaling. In an autocrine manner, it stimulates epithelial repair, including 
epithelial proliferation and barrier restoration. Innate and adaptive immunity are activated, resulting in accelerated vir al 
clearance. Via PU.1, GM -CSF improves alveolar  macrophage  resistance, maturation, ROS production, and phagocytosis capacity, 
e.g., by the Fc γR-mediated opsonophagocytosis. GM -CSF also stimulates activation and proliferation of dendritic cell s, especially  
CD103+ dendritic cell s, and T cells and enhances antigen  priming and influenza virus -specific CD8+ T cell recruitment. Altogether 
alveolar epithelial cell s GM-CSF leads to increased survival and reduced lung injury.  [AEC alveolar epithelial cells, AM alveolar

3.3 Use of sargramostim  in conditions that are similar to COVID -19 ARDS  
A small (18 patient) double blind randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of low -dose (3 mcg/kg daily 
for 5 day s) intravenous GM -CSF treatment in adult patients with severe sepsis and respiratory 
dysfunction, led to the conclusion that GM -CSF treatment was associated with improved gas exchange 
and might play a homeostatic role (Rosler, 2016). In a phase II study, 1 30 patients with severe sepsis 
with respiratory dysfunction were randomized to GM -CSF (250 mcg/m2 intravenously daily for 14 days) 
or placebo. The results showed an improvement in 28 day mortality on GM -CSF; this did not reach 
statistical significance (Paine, 2012).  
Herold and colleagues used  sargramostim by inhalation route on a compassionate basis i n six patients 
with moderate to severe community -acquired pneumonia or ventilator -associated pneumonia -
associated acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) who were not improving despite all measures 
and at least 6 days of mechanical ventilation (Herold, 2014). Sargramostim 125 mcg was applied by 
Aeroneb Solo device (Covidien, Neustadt, Germany) at an interval of 48 hours for 2 doses. Compared to 
historical controls, the authors observed significant improvement in oxygenation and lung compliance

 19 of 46 with GM -CSF therapy. This resulted in improved morbidity using standard scoring systems and 4 of the 
six patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital.  
Six clinical  studies evaluated sargramostim administered via intravenous, subcutaneous, or inhaled 
rout es in critically ill patients and monitored systemic cytokines, markers of inflammation, and safety 
(Meisel, 2009; Hall, 2011; Pinder, 2018; Paine, 2012; Herold, 2014; Rosenbloom, 2005 ).  In these studies, 
there was no increase in systemic cytokines, inclu ding IL -6, IL-8, IL-1β, IL -10, TNFα, GMCSF, and IL -12-
p70, nor an indication of treatment -related organ toxicity or increased rates of treatment -related 
serious adverse events.  Indeed, in the clinical studies where IL -6, a key driver of cytokine storm, wa s 
monitored, no change in the systemic levels were observed.   Importantly, there was no adverse effects 
of sargramostim observed in any of these studies that increased or exacerbated organ toxicity or 
mortality .  In totality, these data suggest that sargramostim does not increase the risk of cytokine storm 
in critically ill patients.  While these studies were of various sizes, improvements in clinical outcomes 
were observed.  
3.4 Recent translational data in COVID -19 
A recent study has shown that the repli cation of SARS -CoV-2 in alveolar cells can result in a limited 
antiviral response, void of IFN -I and IFN -III response in both a human lung alveolar carcinoma cell line 
and in vivo in ferrets  (Blanco -Melo , 2020) .  In addition, by using ex vivo human lung ti ssue explants 
respectively challenged by the same inoculum of SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV, it was found that SARS -
CoV-2 was capable of infecting and producing significantly higher amount of virus in human lung tissues 
while triggering suboptimal levels of IFNs  and pro -inflammatory cytokines/chemokines during that same 
time period.  These findings could possibly implicate an escape from innate immune detection  (Chu, 
2020).   An efficient immune suppression in the early phase may allow the SARS -CoV-2 to replicate 
unchecked in the respiratory tract, achieving high viral load and eventually contributing to its efficient 
person -to-person transmission before onset of severe clinical symptoms  (Wei, 2020).   Evidence of 
additional immune dysfunction comes from the autopsy  reports of COVID -19 patients demonstrating a 
low number of CD8 positive T lymphocytes infiltrating lung tissue  (Yao, 2020).   As described in 
laboratory reports, along with the increased levels of cytokines in systemic circulation, a decrease of 
immune cell populations such as CD4, CD8 and NK cells in peripheral blood were identified as risk factor 
of cytokine storm in COVID -19-infected pneumonia patients  (Chen, 2020 ; Wenjun , 2020; Ruan , 2020) .  
Additionally, the NK cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes appear ed to be exhausted with a reduced ability to 
produce CD107a, IFN -γ, IL-2, granzyme B, and TNF -α (Zheng, 2020) .  The T cells from COVID -19 patients 
also have significantly higher levels of the exhaustion markers PD -1 as compared to the healthy controls  
(Zheng, 2020).   These increases in PD -1 and Tim -3 expression on T cells w ere reported as the patient s 
progressed from mildly symptomatic to severe stage, further indicative of T cell exhaustion.  
Interestingly, the SARS -CoV protease 3CLPro -transfected lung epi thelial cells were shown to have a 
decreased GM -CSF mRNA and protein expression suggesting that the SARS -CoV may play a role in the 
mechanism of lung fibrosis of SARS through the suppression of GM -CSF (Liao, 2011). 
If there is viral immune evasion, the host may be predisposed towards a more belligerent wave of 
cytokine and chemokine activity with marked inflammatory responses as the viral load increases.  
Profound lung damage due to unchecked viral replication can ca use a complete breakdown of epithelial 
barrier function leading to diffuse alveolar damage with increased microvascular permeability.  There is 
leakage of hallmark inflammatory cytokines such as IL -6 and IL -1 into systemic circulation and a 
concurrent recr uitment of neutrophils and pro -inflammatory monocytes into the lung.  This ensuing 
‘cytokine storm’, with incessant proinflammatory cytokine production and accumulation of pro -
inflammatory cells can eventually overwhelm the homeostatic tissue repair functi ons in the lung leading 
to irreversible tissue damage and depletion of AMs  (Herold, 2011 ; Wong , 2019) .  During this process the

 20 of 46 activated fibroblasts can deposit excess collagen to impair gas exchange in the lung  (Meduri, 1993 ).  
Epithelial cell death may also expose the basement membrane to secondary microbial pathogens 
offering them access to the systemic circulation  (Plotkowski , 1986).  AMs are the sentinels of innate 
immune system against the respiratory pathogens.  They do so via secretion of oxygen me tabolites, anti -
microbial proteases and by initiating an inflammatory response that can recruit activated neutrophils 
into alveolar spaces. They can also aid in resolving inflammation after the infectious challenge gets 
resolved , by phagocytosing the apopt otic neutrophils.  This can reduce the pro -inflammatory cytokine 
secretion by macrophages and the production of anti -inflammatory cytokines such as TGF - and IL -10 
(Haslett , 1999; Knapp , 2003).   Therefore, the loss of AMs could be one of the likely contributors of failed 
lung functions in COVID -19 patients.  Importantly, w hile AMs were found to as the principle lung 
macrophages in both heathy controls and mildly infected COVI D-19 patients, they we re almost 
completely lost in the severely infected lungs in these patients  (Liao, 2020).  
Viral, bacterial, and fungal pulmonary infections can all cause the cytokine storm syndrome that may be 
challenging to differentiate on clinical grounds. A complex cyt okine response that builds in infection is 
characterized by series of overlapping networks that may show similarities across indications but may 
also be different in amplitude and features, such that it is important to highlight them. A more 
aggressive for m, labeled cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome 
characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction that is associated with chimeric antigen receptor 
(CAR) -T cell therapy, therapeutic antibodies, and haploidentical a llogeneic transplantation. Levels of 
inflammatory markers and cytokines may differ dramatically between this and other manifestations of 
cytokine storms  (Vardhana , 2020) . The hyperinflammatory response in COVID -19 has been likened to 
conditions including classical ARDS, macrophage activation syndrome or hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis, or simply “cytokine storm.” It is likely that none of these syndromes can precisely 
fit all COVID -19 patients due to the complexity and heterogeneity in inflammatory effe cts and diverse 
pathophysiology of the disease seen across different patients , however , several biomarkers (ferritin, C -
reactive protein  (CRP)  and d -dimers) have shown a strong correlation of worsening disease or mortality  
(Chen 2020a; Chen,  2020 b; Richardson , 2020 ). 
3.5 Clinical experience of inhaled sargramostim  
There is a large body of evidence of inhaled sargramostim in autoimmune pulmonary alveolar 
proteinosis (aPAP), which results in accumulation of surfactant in alveolar sacs with resultant hypox ia. 
Tazawa and colleagues conducted a phase II study of inhaled sargramostim at 9 pulmonary centers 
throughout Japan in patients with unremitting or progressive aPAP with hypoxia and symptoms 
(Tazawa, 2010). Patients received 250 mcg daily by inhalation, u sing an LC -PLUS nebulizer with a manual 
interrupter valve connected to a PARI Turbo BOY compressor, for 7 days and this cycle was repeated 
every other week for six cycles (total 12 weeks). The treatment was well tolerated with no serious 
adverse events. Ad verse events were reported in 7 of the 39 patients receiving GM -CSF, and these were 
all transient. The treatment led to an improvement in oxygenation, radiological changes as well as 
symptoms.  Thirty five of these patients were followed for a 30 -month obs ervation period and  
sargramostim was shown to sustain remission in over half of the patients  (Tazawa, 2014).  A study using 
the I -neb nebulizer, conducted in 6 aPAP patients evaluated inhaled sargramostim 250 mcg once daily in 
a 4 days on, 4 days off sched ule as long as needed (Papiris, 2014).  Upon remission, the dose of 
sargramostim  was reduced.  All patients achieve d remission and 3 patients maintained remission when 
the dose was reduced; no significant adverse events were noted (Papiris, 2014).  
Followin g these results , a larger randomized phase 3 study (also referred to as the PAGE study) was 
conducted by the Japanese investigators in 12 centers. Sixty -four  patients with mild to moderate aPAP 
with hypoxia were randomized to receive placebo or  sargramosti m (33 patients) at a dose of 125 mcg 
PTX-001-002 P ROTOCOL  | Partner Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
Property of Partner Therapeutics - strictly confidential  
 21 of 46 twice a day for 7 days  followed by a week of no treatment and this two week cycle was repeated 12 
times over a period of 24 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated with no significant differences in 
adverse events betwe en the two groups. The GM -CSF treated patients had a significantly improved 
hypoxia parameter as were the radiological changes (Tazawa, 2019).  
This clinical experience of use of sargramostim in viral pneumonia and aPAP suggests salutary effects. In 
additio n, these studies establish the safety of inhaled sargramostim and also provide evidence for 
activity of inhaled sargramostim.  
3.6 Use of sargramostim inhalation in COVID -19  
An investigator -sponsor ed study  in Belgium [ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]], “ Prospective, Randomized, Op en-label, 
Interventional Study to Investigate the Efficacy of  Sargramostim  (Leukine®) in Improving Oxygenation 
and Short - and Long -term Outcome of  COVID -19 (Corona Virus Disease) Patients With Acute Hypoxic 
Respiratory Failure ”, was initiated on March 26, 2020 . Patients were randomized  to receive either 
inhaled  sargramostim  125 mcg twice daily via a  Philips© InnoSpire  Go portable mesh nebulizer  for 5 days 
(active group)  together  with institutional standard of care  (SOC), or SOC alone (control group).  SOC 
included:  administration  of antibiotics, anti -viral therapy,  and use of  supplemental oxygen  and 
noninvasive  or invasive ventilation  (as necessary).  A data  safety monitoring board (DSMB) is overseeing 
the study.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Based on the scientific rationale that GM -CSF is critical to maintain and restore lung function as well as 
the totali ty of clinical data in critically ill patients as well as patients with COVID -19, this study will 
evaluate whether inhaled sargramostim can improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute 
hypoxemia due to COVID -19.  As discussed above in Section 3.4, the biomarkers ferritin, CRP and d -
dimers are correlated with worsening of disease and high mortality  in patients with COVID -19.  To 
enable constant safety monitoring du ring the study , daily monitoring of these biomarkers during the 
sargramostim treatment period  is required and will be  evaluated (alongside adverse events and other 
routine laboratory  tests)  by the Data Safety Monitoring Board  (see Section 12.2  for more details) .  After 
the first 9 and 22  patients were enrolled and treated with up to 5 days of sargramostim, the DMSB 
reviewed safety data . Following its second review, the  DSMB supported a) expanding the study to 120 
patients and b) excluding patients with serious baseline pulmonary comorbid  conditions.

 25 of 46 8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered with a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the patient  that emerge during the reporting period, that were 
not present prior to the AE reporting period  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by the 
investigator to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character during the 
reporting period  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence regardless of causality that results in 
any of the following : 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• An important  medical event  that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prev ent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the definition above  
8.2 Safety Reporting  
8.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs regardless of seriousness, starting  from informed consent ( i.e., occurring during the baseline 
period even in the absence of any administration of  treatment ), up to 30 days following  the last dose of 
treatment , are to be recorded on the case report form  (CRF). Any SAEs experienced after this 30 day 
period should only be reported if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.  
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms.  The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, severi ty, action taken with respect to study drug , 
corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations perf ormed, outcome, and his/her opinion 
as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study drug . Adverse events 
should be followed until the event has resolved, stabilized, has decreased in severity to the same or less 
than bas eline (pre -treatment), or patient has complete d the follow -up period.  
Vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are symptomatic  and/or requiring 
corrective treatment  and/or leading to treatment discontinuation and/or modification of dosing and/or 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion.  
Laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they lead to treatment discontinuation , 
modification of dosing , fulfill a seriousness criterion , additional concomitant therapy , and/ or additional 
medical procedures .

 26 of 46 Treatment -emergent adverse events are adverse events that begin or worsen after the start of 
treatment.  
8.2.2 Attribution of the AE  
The relationship or attribution of an adverse event to treatment is defined as follows:  
- Defin ite - The AE is clearly related to the study treatment  
- Probable  - The AE is likely related to the study treatment  
- Possible  - The AE may be related to the study treatment  
- Unlikely  - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment

8.2.3 Grading of AEs  
All adverse events will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) , 
version 5.0 or later .  Grade refers to the severity of the AE.  The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through  5 with 
unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline:  
Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2 : Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  (ADL; i.e. preparing meals, shopping for 
groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc ) 
Grade 3 : Severe or me dically significant but not  immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL  (i.e. bathing, dressing 
and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not be dridden)  
Grade 4 : Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5 : Death related to AE

8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
In the case of a SAE, a pregnancy report, or an overdose, the Investigator must immediately:  
• REPORT  (within 24 hours  by fax or e-mail ) the CIOMS informat ion related to the SAE , pregnancy 
or overdose  to PTx 
e-mail :   
fax number :  
ENTER the inform ation related to the SAE in the appropriate SAE form and AE CRF and 
include a photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these 
examinations were performed. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's 
identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical tria l are properly 

PTX-001-002 P ROTOCOL  | Partner Therapeutics, Inc.

 27 of 46 mentioned on any copy of source document provided to PTx. For laboratory results, 
include the laboratory normal ranges . 
o All further data updates should be recorded in the SAE form and AE CRF as appropriate, 
and further documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory  data, 
concomitant medication, patient status) should be reported (by fax or e-mail  as detailed 
above ) to PTx within 24 hours of knowledge.   In addition, effort should be made to 
further document each SAE that is fatal or life threatening within the week (7 days) 
following initial notification.  
o An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely 
unrelated to a prev iously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
8.3 Expected Toxicities  
For inhaled  sargramostim use in patients with COVID -19, no serious adverse events are considered to be 
expected except for COVID -19 disease -related adverse events. If the  investigator considers a COVID -19 
disease related event to be related to inhaled sargramostim, or if the event is more severe than 
anticipated for the disease, and the event is serious, it must be reported as a suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactio n (SUSAR).  
COVID -19 is a very recent syndrome, on which few data are available.  Clinical features  that will be 
considered as events  due to the disease , include dyspnea, cough, sputum production, expectoration, 
pneumonia, malaise, myalgia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, chest 
tightness, chest pain, chest discomfort, abnormal laboratory values (leukopenia, lymphopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, elevated levels of C -reactive protein), drop in oxygen saturation, progression to 
respiratory failure, progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypotension, or progression to 
multi -organ failure (Wang, 2020; Huang, 2020; Chen, 2020 a; Yang, 2020).   Severe COVID -19 may lead to 
death.  
8.4 Unexpected Toxicities  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the 
competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as 
per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.  
9 RISKS AND TOXICITIES  
9.1 Overdose  
There is no clinical experience with overdose of sargramostim, and no specific antidote or detoxification 
measures can be recommended to date. If accidental overdose is suspected, the patient should be 
treated symptomatically.  
9.2 Preg nancy  or Lactation  
There are limited data in pregnant and breastfeeding women.  There is p otential for increased risk of 
spontaneous abortion based on rabbit studies.  Investigators should counsel patients of the risk to the 
fetus. Do NOT use diluents with pres ervatives.  
Note  - this information is based on systemic administration  of sargramostim .  There are no data 
available for inh aled sargramostim .

Property of Partner Therapeutics - strictly confidential  
 28 of 46 The limited available data on sargramostim  use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform the drug -
associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Based on animal studies sargramostim  may cause 
embryofetal harm. In animal reproduction studies, administration of sargramostim  to pregnant rabbit s 
during organogenesis resulted in adverse developmental outcomes including increased spontaneous 
abortion at systemic exposures ≥1.3 times the human exposure expected at the recommended human 
dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.  
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is 
unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the 
U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in 
clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% -4% and 15% -20%, respectively.  
9.2.2 Lactation Risk Summary  
There is no information regarding the presence of sargramostim  in human milk, the effects on the 
breastfed child , or the effects on milk production. Administration of sargramostim  to rabbits during 
lactation resulted in reduction in postnatal offspring survival . Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 2 weeks 
after the last dose.   
10 SCHEDULE OF EVENTS AND STUDY PARAMETERS

(1) Day 6 study assessments will be conducted up to 24 hours after the last dose of sargramostim. Should the patient be discharge d before Day 6, the last day of study drug 
administration will be recorded, and post -treatment assessments will be conducted within 24 hours of the last dose, before the patient is discharged from the hospital . 
(2) During Days 7 -27, study procedures and data will be collected until Day 27 or discharge, whichever is earlier .  
(3) If a virtual visit or telephone call is conducted, collect adverse events, and documentation of ventilation and supplemental  oxygen . 
(4) Collection of final follow -up on Day 90 can occur anytime between Day 60 -120. If the patient had a hospital visit during this period , collect  all relevant data as indic ated. If 
patient had a virtual  visit or phone call  during this period  collect adverse event s, survival status  , and documentation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen . 
(5) AE data should be collected up to 30 days following the last dose of treatment .  Any SAEs experienced after this 30 day period should only be reported if the investigator 
suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.  
(6) Survival status can also be o btained using public records, such as obituaries or vital records search, where country and local regulations permit . 
(7) Documentation of ventilation (and supplemental oxygen if admitted) is required on Day 14  only . 
(8) Arterial blood gases should be performed via arterial puncture on Day 1 or within 24 hours before first sargramostim and/or standard of care and at Day 6 or day of 
discharge, whichever is earlier.  On all other days, if arterial blood gas assessment is  not done, PaO2 will be estimated from percent O2 saturation (SpO2) by pulse oximetry.  For 
sites located at higher altitudes (> 1000m above sea level), an altitude correction to the PaO2/FiO2 ratio should be made by multiplying the PaO2/FiO2 ratio using a verage 
ambient to sea level barometric pressure correction.  See  Section 10.2  for more details .

 31 of 46 10.1 Safety  Evaluations  
Laboratory data , as performed and collected as part of SOC (see Table 1), will be collected  and include 
the following:  
• Hematology laboratory parameters :  complete blood count with differential, hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, and absolute counts for white blood cells, pla telets, neutrophils, lymphocytes, 
eosinophils and monocytes.  
• Chemistry laboratory parameters :  albumin, amylase, lipase, BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, LDH, 
serum alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, glucose, total protein, sodium, potassium, 
chlo ride, bicarbonate , calcium and uric acid.   
• Required  laboratory measurements of f erritin, d -dimers  and C -reactive protein should also be 
collected  at screening , Days 1 -6 and any other time it is performed as part of SOC.  
• Immune profiling , if performed, including CD4+, CD8+, HLA -DR, IL-6, IL-1, GM -CSF 
10.2 Efficacy Evaluations  
Efficacy data , as performed and collected as SOC   (see Table 1), will be collected and include the 
following:  
• The n eed for and duration of mechanical ventilation, or other means of respiratory support . 
• Evalua tion of arterial blood gases  for oxygenation parameters including PaO 2 (partial pressure of 
oxygen) , FiO 2 (fraction of inspired oxygen ), PaO 2/FiO 2ratio , SpO 2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) , 
PaCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) , bicarbonate , pH and P(A-a)O 2 gradient  (alveolar -
arterial)  oxygen gradient .  
o For sites located at higher altitudes (> 1000m above sea level), an altitude correction to 
the PaO2/FiO2 ratio should be made by multiplying the PaO2/FiO2 ratio using average 
ambient to sea level barometric pressure correction (e.g. correction of 0.86 for sites 
located in Salt Lake City, Utah or correction of  0.84 for sites located in Denver, 
Colorado).  
o Arterial blood gases should be performed via an arterial puncture taken on Day 1 (or 
within 24 hours) prior to the first dose of sargramostim and/or standar d of care and at 
Day 6 (or day of discharge, whichever is earlier).  Assessment of oxygenation  on all other 
days can be determined using a noninvasive measurement by estimating PaO2 from 
percent saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen as measured by pulse oxi metry (SpO2) . 
The table below provides the imputed PaO2/FiO2 ratio (cells) for combinations of SpO2 
(rows) and FiO2 (columns).

11.1 Patient Discontinuation Criteria  
Patients will receive sargramostim and/or SOC  for the duration of treatment  and remain on study  for 
the duration of study period , unless:  
- Patient withdraws consent or decision by the patient (or his/her legally authorized decision 
maker) or investigator/ attending physician to stop  treatment  
- Unacceptable toxicity  to sargramostim  and/or SOC  
- Occurrence of a treatment -related serious adverse event  (see S ection 8.2.2  for treatment 
attribution)  

PTX-001-002 P ROTOCOL  | Partner Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
Property of Partner Therapeutics - strictly confidential  
 33 of 46 - Occurrence of a treatment -related Grade ≥ 3 adverse event  (see Section 8.2.2 for treatment 
attribution)  
- Rapid deterioration requiring other advanced treatments or medical care not conducive to 
continued treatment wit h sargramostim  
- Death  
Patients who discontinue treatment earl y, should remain on study and continue follow -up per the 
schedule of events  (unless consent is withdrawn  from study participation ). 
11.2 Study Comp letion  
Study completion  will be defined as the date when the last patient complete s study treatment (including 
SOC), completes the follow -up period , or has withdrawn from the study .  Alternatively, the study may be 
stopped earlier  for reasons such as feasibility, poor enrollment , ethical or safety reasons.  
Refer to Table 1, for a complete list of assessments required through the clinical trial.  
11.3 Duration of Treatment  (Days 1 -5) 
All p atients  randomized to the sargramostim treatment arm will receive sargramostim treatment for up 
to 5 days . For the purpose of this study, Day 1 is the day the patient receives the first dose of 
sargramostim  and/or SOC .  All patients will receive SOC per their institutional standards ; SOC may vary 
in duration . 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health, protocol treatment 
should be discontinued. This includes any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality  or intercurrent 
illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued treatment with study therapy is 
not in the best interest of the patient . 
11.4 Duration of Study  Period  (Days 6 -28) 
Following the sargramostim treatment period  (Day s 1-5), patients should  continue to receive SOC as 
appropriate following institutional guidelines . The study period (Days 6 -28) will continue until 
completion of all safety and e fficacy asses sments on Day 28  (end of study) . 
All patients, including those who discontinue treatment  early, should  be followed  for the duration of the 
study period . 
11.5 Duration of Follow -up (up to Day 9 0) 
All p atients , including those that have withdrawn from the study or discontinued sargramostim,  shoul d 
be followed  for safety  evaluations for up to Day 90. Data from a  final follow -up visit at day 90  (+/-30 
days)  should  also be collected . 
Only patients that have withdrawn their consent to partic ipate in the trial  are excluded from further 
follow -up after their consent has been withdrawn.  Any available  data up to the date of withdrawal of 
consent will be used  for the purpose of this study.  
12 STATISTICAL PLAN  
12.1 Sample size consideration  
Approximately 120 patients will be randomized: of which 80 will recei ve sargramostim + SOC, and 40 
patients who will receive SOC alone to evaluat e the clinical efficacy  and safety  of sargramostim in 
patients  with COVID -19 associated acute hypoxemi a.   
PTX-001-002 P ROTOCOL  | Partner Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
Property of Partner Therapeutics - strictly confidential  
 34 of 46 The sample size was based on practical and clinical considerations to ensure that the efficacy endpoints 
and safety profile could be appropriately evaluated and was not based on any statistical assumptions or 
hypotheses.   As a result, the analyses of this study will be considered as descriptive analyses.  
12.2 Data Safety Monitori ng Board  
The DSMB  will compris e of independent  external experts  to review  the safety and benefit/risk data  
using the following  guidelines : 
• after the first approximately 10 patients are treated for 5 days with sargramostim ; enrollment 
will be paused after t he 10th patient is enrolled until the safety review is completed   
• after the first approximately 20 patients are treated for 5 days with sargramostim ; enrollment 
will be paused after the 20th patient is enrolled until  the safety review  is completed  
• after approximately 60 patients (total of both treatment arms) are enrolled to the study . Upon 
completion of this safety review , the DSMB may request an additional review after 
approximately 80 patients have been randomized. Enrollment will not be paused d uring these 
reviews.   
• any reported significant SAE can also trigger a safety review , including , but not limited to  ≥2 
patients experiencing a similar SAE or grade ≥3 AE, ≥2 patients discontinue for similar safety 
reasons ; an unplanned safety review  may require an enrollment pause  
The safety review will occur as a real -time review  of patient  data , using the data available  as well as a 
cumulative safety review  as the data accrues . That is, the available data will be accepted as is, and may  
not have gone through any data cleaning processes.   The DSMB will review  adverse events and serious 
adverse events, key laboratory parameters such as ferritin , d-dimers,  and CRP , and other routine 
laboratory value s (hematology, chemistry, coagulation)  as well as oxygenation parameter P(A -a)O 2 
gradient .  
The DSMB will make recommendations on pausing enrollment, modifying and/or stopping the study , 
including assessing whether randomization should continue, or whether additional changes to the 
treatment arms is warranted .   
The DSMB  can also modify the planned schedule of safety revie ws based on the observed data, taking 
into account the study enrollment patterns, observed safety profile of the ongoing study, and/or any 
other external data that may emerge.   
Refer to the Data Safety Monitoring Board  Charter  for addi tional  details . 
12.3 General Statistical Methods  
All patients who receive at least one dose of sargramostim and/or SOC  will be included in the efficacy 
and safety analyses.  An additional analyses will b e performed on the intent -to-treat population defined 
as all randomized patients.  
A per protocol population will be defined as all patients who receive  sargramostim and/ or standard of 
care and  meet the eligibility criteria of this study.  Violations of the  eligibility criteria have the potential 
to influence the efficacy or safety results of the study  (see Section 6 for eligibility criteria) . 
All analyses will be cons idered as descriptive analyses.  Derivation of two -sided 95% confidence intervals 
and p -values will be generated where applicable.  
Time to event endpoints will be defined as the start date/time to the end date/time; censoring dates will 
be the last date/ti me the patient was determined to be event -free.  Kaplan Meier methods  will be used 
for time to event endpoint analyses ; a logrank test will be performed to compare the two survival 
PTX-001-002 P ROTOCOL  | Partner Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
Property of Partner Therapeutics - strictly confidential  
 35 of 46 curves .  Timepoints estimates and median survival will be derived from the Kaplan Meier analysis.  A Cox 
proportional hazards model may also be used to compare the two treatment arms using a hazard ratio.  
Categorical endpoints will be calculated as the percentage of  patients with the event, relative to the 
number of patients treated.   Logistic regression approaches and/or repeated measures statistical 
approaches may be used to compare patients on the sargramostim  and control arms , in addition to 
Fisher’s Exact or Chi2 tests (as appropriate) . 
Continuous endpoints will be summarized by n, means, medians, minimum, maximum, and 25th and 75th 
percentiles.   Analysis of variance , analysis of covariance , and/or repeated measures  statistical  
approaches may be used to compare patients on the sargramostim and control arms . 
In the event  that the underlying assumptions and/or distribution s for a given statistical method are not 
satis fied, alternative statistical methods will be employed.    
Missing data may be imputed using last-observation -carried forward, or other advanced statistical 
imputation methods.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be performed to evaluate the robustness  and sensitivity  of the 
study results, including but not limited to the analysis  population s, subgroup analyses, treatment 
interactions, adjusted or stratified analyses,  and/or alternative statistical methods.  
A statistical analys is plan will contain further details of the planned statistical analyses.  Any important 
changes to the planned statistical analyses will be document ed as amendments to the statistical analys is 
plan  and/or documented in the study report .  
12.3.1  Primary Endpoint(s): Oxygenation at Day 6, and Intubation  by Day 14  
The primary endpoint of change in oxygenation parameter of P(A-a)O 2 grad ient will be evaluated, using 
a repeated measure analyses of variance methods.  Key timepoints of interest include Day 6 (primary 
measure) and Day 14 (secondary measure) .   
Another key primary endpoint will be the  rate of intubation by Day 14.  That is, an y occurrence of 
intubation  at any point time in time between Days 1 and 14, will be considered to be an event.   The 
treatment arms will be compared using a  Fisher’s Exact or Chi2 tests (as appropriate) , and/or by logistic 
regression approaches.   
Handling of missing data is specified above in Section 12.3 . 
12.3.2  Secondary  and Exploratory  Endpoints  
The secondary and exploratory endpoints described in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 above will be analyzed  using 
the general statistical methods as described above in Section 12.3 .  Key timepoints of interest for 
endpoints include Day 6 , Day 14 , and Day 28 , where data are available .  Assessments of ventilator usa ge 
will consider alternative devices, in light of possible ventilator shortages.  Refer to FDA Guidance for

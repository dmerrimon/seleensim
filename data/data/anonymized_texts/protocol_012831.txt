1.2.2.2 Changes in diet, physical activity, body composition (BMI, w aist and 
hip circumference, and measurements from the DEXA scan), quality of  life,  
and  psychosocial  determinants  of  behavior  chang e  will  be ex amined 
in this sample of obese, post-menopausal women  taking metformin or 
receiving a diet and physical activity intervention. 
2.0 Background  
 
2.1 Obesity and endometri al cancer 
 
Numerous epidemiologic studies  have demonstrated that obesity is strongly associated 
with an increased risk of endometrial cance r. While an average woman has a 3% 
lifetime risk of endometrial cance r, obes e women  have a 9-10% lifetime risk of 
endometrial cancer.[1] In addition, obese  women account for almost 50% of all 
endometrial cance rs.[1] In a recent review of diet and cancer by the American Institute 
for Cancer Research  and World Cancer Research  Fund (WCRF), authors stated that 
the evidence relating body mass index and canc er is strongest for endometrial cancer, 
but also is compelling for breast, colon, kidney and gallbladder c ance r.[2] 
 
There are a number of ways in which obes ity has been hypothesized to increase risk of 
endometrial canc er. Obese women have incre ased bioavailability of adrenal steroids,  
increased peripheral  conv ersion in adipose tissues of the adrenal steroids to estrone, 
and increased bioavailability of free estrogens due to decre ased sex hormone binding  
globulin. This “hyper-estrogenic state” is believed to result in increa sed endometrial cell 
mitosis, leading to endometrial hyperplasia,  a pre- malignant lesion, and to endometrial 
cancer. Ho wever, incre ased levels of circulatin g endogenous estrogen cannot  
completely explain the association of obesity and endometrial cance r. While some 
clinical studies show a  correlation between higher plasma  levels of endogenous  
estrogens or andro gens in women with endo metrial cance r versus controls, others do 
not.[3-13] Epidemiologic studies addressing t his questi on also yield conflicting results. 
In a large study by Potischman et al, the authors found that body mass index 
remained a significant risk factor for the development of endome trial cancer even after 
controll ing for endogenous estrogen. They conclu ded that high levels of endogenou s 
estrogens were not sufficient to explain the incre ased risk of obesity to endo metrial 
cance r.[11] Another prospective multicenter study demonstra ted that the risk of 
endometrial cance r associated with endogenous estrogen levels in postme nopausa l 
women remained significant after adjus ting for BMI.[13] 
 
What other mechanisms could  explain the association of obesity  to the development of 
endometrial cancer? Are there other mechani sms that explain why obesity  
isassociated with a number  of other cancers? The American Cancer Society has 
recently highlighted the incre ased risk of a number of cancers in obes e women.  In 
particular, canc ers of hormonally regulated organs, includ ing endometrium, breast 
and ovary, have been  show n in epidemiologic studies  to be associated with obesit y.[14]  
  2011-0739

 Other cancers including gallbladder,  colon and prostate are also seen more frequently 
in the obes e.[14] Is there an underlying metabolic cause  for this incre ased cance r risk? 
 
Hyperinsulinemia and the insulin resist ant state are closely associated with obesity, and 
may contrib ute in a me aningful way to incre ase the risk of cancer in an obes e perso n. 
Recently, adiponectin, an adipocyte- derived protein highly c orrelated with 
hyperinsulinemia, has been  shown to be associated with endom etrial cancer, 
independent of body mass index.[15, 16]   One study has demonstrated that this 
association between adiponectin and endometrial cance r may be stronger in 
postmenopausa l women than premenopausal women.[16]  Studies in patients with 
diabetes have demonstrated varying effects of metformin on serum levels of 
adiponecti n.[17, 18] 
 
Furthermore, since  insulin has been shown to potentiate estrogen-regulated gene 
expression, obese  women in particular  may be at increased risk for estrogen associated 
cance rs, including  endometrial cance r. Epidemiologically, a number of studies have 
shown a modest association of diabetes with endom etrial canc er risk.[19-24] 
Interestingly, in three studies  the most significant risks were seen  in women  who were 
both obes e and diabetic.[19, 22, 24]   A study by Troisi et al examined insulin levels in 
women  with endometrial canc er compared to controls in order to determine if elevated 
insulin levels could  explain the association of obesity and endometrial cancer.[25]  
While elevated serum insulin levels, as measu red by C-protein, were associated with 
incre ased risk of endometrial cancer, elevation of serum insulin levels alone could not 
account for the association of obesity  and endometrial cancer.     In this study we will 
address  the hypothesis that obesity associated hyperinsulinemia and insulin resist ance , 
in combination with hyperestro genism, contributes to the increased risk of endom etrial 
cance r. 
 
2.2 Metformin,  mechanism of action and poss ible role in the prevention of cance r 
 
While metformin was first described more than 50 years ago, the exact molecular 
mechanism of action for this drug has only recently been determined.[26] Metformin 
activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via phosphorylation by the LKB1 t umor 
suppres sor.[27, 28]   AMPK is  typically  activated in response  to metabolic stress, a nd 
results in inhibition of ATP-consuming pathways, such as choles terol synthesis,  fatty 
acid synthesis and protein translation.[29, 30]   Importantly, AMPK in hibits mTOR via 
phosp horylation and activation of tuberous sclerosis  complex 2 (TSC2).    TSC1/TSC2 
forms the TSC complex  that negatively regulates mTOR si gnaling.[31] 
 
Recent clinical studies  suggest that metformin may be associated with a decre ased risk 
of cance r. In an observational cohort study of diabetics  perform ed by Libby et al, incident  
cancer was diagnose d among 7.3% of 4,085 metformin users compared with 11.6% 
of 4,085 comparators (p<0.001).[32]   In a recent case-control study performed at MD 
Anderson, Li et al reporte d that diabetic  patients who had taken metformin had a 
significantly lo wer risk of pancreatic  cancer compared to those who had not taken 
metformin.[33]  Jiralersp ong et al reporte d that among diabetic women with breast 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
6 
 canc er undergoing neoa djuvant chemotherapy, those individuals who were on 
metformin had a higher pathologic comple te response rate than those who were on 
other anti-diabetic medication.[34]     The results of these studies  are provocative, and 
suggest that metformin may have a role in both the prevention and treatment of multiple 
cance rs. 
 
The signaling pathways activated by metformin treatment suggest a promising role 
for  me tformin  as  an  anti-canc er  agent  in  endometrial  cance r,  as  well  as  other 
cance rs that have activated PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathways.  Metformin treatment in 
estradiol   tre ated   Balb/c   mice   resulted   in   significantly   decre ased   density   of 
endometrial glands, decrease d immunohistochemical expression of mTOR sig naling 
and decre ased proliferation indices as measu red by PCN A expressio n.[35]   Ben Sahra 
et al investigated the effects of metformin on human prostate cance r cells (LN CaP) and 
in an in vivo xenog raft mouse model.  Their studies identified that in LNCaP  canc er  
cells  metformin  activated  AMPK  and  inhibited  proliferation  by blocking the cell 
cycle in G0/G1 phase , which was accompa nied by decreased cyclin D1,  decreased 
phosph orylation of Rb and increased p27Kip1 expressio n.  Metformin treatment of an 
LNCaP tumor bearing xenog raft model resulted in a significant reducti on in tumor 
growth.[36]  Schneider et al. investigated the effect of metformin in high-fat diet fed 
hamsters; a model of pancreatic  cance r.  They identified that 50% of the high-fat diet 
fed hamsters develop pancre atic tumors; wh ereas metformin treated high-fat diet fed 
hamsters did not develop tumors.[37]      Additionally, administration  of metformin to 
LKB1 hypomorphic PTEN+/- mice incre ased AMPK phosphorylation  and  significantly  
delayed  tumor  ons et  with  100%  of  the  control group developing tumors of the liver, 
spleen and intestine  by 4 months of age and the metformin treated group developing 
tumors by 5 months of age.[38] Taken together, these studies suggest that metformin 
may prevent or significantly  delay t umor progression as a consequence of AMPK 
activation. 
 
The effect of metformin on the endometrium has been examined in women  with 
polycystic ovarian syndrome.   In a smal l, open- label study of metformin versus 
rosiglitazone, endometrial histology was evaluated at baseline and following a 3- month 
treatment period in 16 women with PCOS.     Two women with sim ple hyperpl asia  were  
treated  with   m etformin  and  experience d   regression   during treatment providing 
preliminary evidence  that metformin may have benef icial effects on the 
endometrium.[ 39]   The results of this study, in additio n to our studies  in rodents, provide 
evidence that metformin has a direct effect on the endometrium. 
2.3 Diet and e xercise linked to hyperinsulinemia and ins ulin resistance 
 
The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial compared a lifestyle intervention 
or metformin to metformin placebo. The intensive portion of the lifestyle intervention 
was composed of 16 face-to-face sessions with a lifestyle coach  in which 
partic ipants  were assisted with incre asing their physical activity, reducing  their caloric 
intake, and reducing weight by at least 7%.  The trial demonstrated that both a lifestyle 
intervention and metformin reduced incidence of diabetes, with larger effects for the 
lifestyle intervention [22].   Particularly notable given the relationship between 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
7 
 endometri al cancer and adipone ctin was that both inter ventions were associ ated 
with increases in adiponec tin, with the effects of  the lifestyle intervention being 
approxi mately 3.5 times larger than those for the metformin  group [23].  Lifestyle 
intervention and metformin were also associated with reducti ons in metabolic syndrome 
[24] and (C-reactive protein) CRP in women,  the reduction in CRP was related to weight 
loss [25]. The effects of the lifestyle intervention on adiponection may be related 
primarily to weight loss;  a small study found that reduce d calorie diet with or without 
exercise increase d circulating adiponecti n, but th at exercise alone and exercise plus 
reduced calorie diet enhanc ed expression of adiponectin receptors in skeletal muscle 
and adipose tissue [26]. Increase s in adiponection also have been found in response to 
weight loss after bariatric surgery [27]. I nterestingly, in a recent report on the association 
of bariatric surgery and cance r incidence , the disease  most profoundly affected was 
uterine cance r, primarily EndoCa [28]. 
 
We  are  intrigued  by  the  possi bility  that  both  pharmacologic  intervention  with 
metformin and a lifestyle behav ior in terventi on, both of which reduce  insulin resist ance , 
might also have a direct chemopreventive effect of EC. Cur rently, options for   EC   
chem oprevention   include   use   of   the   oral   contra ceptive   or   use   of progestins.[40] 
Both have limitations in an obese  cohort. Oral  contraceptives (OCP) are contraindicated 
in morbidly  obes e individuals due to an increase  in rate of thromb o-embolic events.  In 
additio n, obese women  frequently have  hyperte nsion or hyperch olesterolemia, which 
are also considered contraindications to OCP use. Pro gestins have similar 
contrai ndications and compound obesity by stimulating appetite. While weight loss and 
exercise are obvious solutions to decreasing the risk of EC in obes e individuals, 
exploration of alternative approaches is neces sary. The novelty of these 
chem oprevention/behavioral prevention strategy is twofold. First, it proposes to treat 
an underlying metabolic syndrome. Rather than focusing on the prevention of a single 
cance r, this strategy may have not only had an overall benef it for the cardiovascular 
health of the obese  woman but may also decrease  the risk of endometrial, pancreatic 
and perhaps other cancers associated with obesi ty and ins ulin resistance .[33] Second, 
it exploits the newly identi fied function of metformin as  a  drug that demonstrates  
direct  anti-proliferative  effects on  end ometrial  (and other) cells via activation of AMPK 
and inhibit ion of mTOR. 
2.4 Rationale and de finition of c ohort  
 
Endom etrial c ancer has well-defined risk cohorts . Epidemiolog ic st udies have 
consist ently show n that women who are overweight are at incre ased risk of endometrial 
canc er, and women who are very overweight are at very incre ased risk. Br inton et al 
conducted a large case control study and found that women  who were greater than 200 
lbs. had a relative risk of 7.2 compared with women  less than 125 lbs .[41]   In order to 
maximize risk for our cohort, we will includ e women  who fulfill standard criteria for 
obesity grade I and above, which is defined as body mass index (BMI)  greater than or 
equal to 30 kg/m2. An upper age limit of 65 has been set. We chose  not  to  include  
pre-menopausal  women  in  this  study  becaus e  of  the confounding problem of 
irregular cycling and varying estrogen levels in pre- menopausal  obese,  insulin  
resist ant  women  (i.e.  women  with  polycystic  ovary 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
8 
 syndrome).  We  also  chose  not  to  include  women  who  fulfill  criteria  for diabetes, 
since additional agents, other than metformin,  may be nece ssary to control their 
diabetes. 
 
2.5 Safety issues  of metformin,  as chemoprevention for endometrial cancer in a cohort  of 
obes e women 
 
Metformin hydrochloride (Glucoph age, Bristol-Myers S quibb) is a biguanide 
antihyperglycemic agent.   It corrects Type II diabetes mellitus by altering glucose 
production and abso rption, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which stimulate insulin 
secretion.  S pecifically, metformin  improves  insulin  sensitiv ity  by  increasing peripheral  
glucose and utilization, decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose and suppressing  
glucose producti on by the liver, thus l owering serum insulin levels. 
 
We believe that metformin is not only safe in this population, but also benef icial. 
 
2.5.1 A randomized phase  III study with metformin was cond ucted in this same 
population i.e.: insulin resist ant but non-diabetic patients (the Diabetes Prevention 
Program Randomized Trial NEJM  2002  (6)346, p393), and demonstrated that 
metformin  was  well  tolerated  in  a  population  of  insulin  resis tant,  non-diabetic 
individuals (and decre ased the incidence of diabetes).[42] This study demonstra tes 
the safety of using this drug in this popula tion and also suggests that we can 
potentially dovetail the cardiovascular and metabolic health benefit of the drug with 
chem oprevention. 
 
2.5.2 Metformin does not incre ase secretion of insulin and therefore does not cause  
hypoglycemia. 
 
2.5.3 Use of metformin in insulin resist ant but non-Type II diabetics  also has 
precedence in the treatment of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome,  or PCOS. 
Clinicia ns use metformin or thiazolidinediones,  insulin-sensitiz ing agents,  in young 
PCOS  w omen,  whose  underlying  metabolic  problem  is  insulin-resist ance. 
Interesting, treatment for their insulin resistance  results in normalization of their 
pituitary/reproductive  hormone  axis  and  subse quently  results  in  ovulation  and 
regular periods.[43, 44] 
   
2.6 Biomarkers as surrogate endpo ints 
 
Endpoints for chemoprevention studies can either be development of cance r, or a 
surrogate for the developmen t of cance r. In this study we will use surrogate biomarkers 
as the primary endpoi nt. 
 
Identification  of  appropriate  biomarkers  is  essenti al  for  this  study.     An  ideal 
biomarker  is a histological or molecular "red flag" that precedes the onse t of cancer. 
Ideal surrogate endpo int biomarkers  are quantit ative and are modulated by 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
9 
 chem opreventive  agents.[45]    In  our  prior  endometrial  canc er  chem oprevention 
study of women  with HNPCC, we evaluated a panel of 30 biomarkers thought to be 
relevant in endometrial carcinogenesis.   F rom that study, we have narrowed down 
the field to a subse t of 6 validated, estrogen-regulated genes and a proliferation marker 
Ki-67.[46] 
 
The following is a summary of the analyses to be performed on the endometrial biopsies 
at baseline and following four months of hormonal therapy: 
 
• Proliferation in dex Ki-67 
• Histology 
• Quantitative PCR transcript  analysis

Estrogen-inducted gene (EIG121) Novel gene of unknown function 
 
 
Biom arkers associated with metformin  function and downstream signaling 
includes: 
 
• phos pho-AMPKa 
• phos pho-ACC  
• phos pho-mTOR 
• phos pho-S6 ribosomal protein. 
 
We will examine pre- and post- treatment endometrial biopsies for histology and 
proliferation using Ki-67. These are standard surrogate endpoints used in cancer 
chem oprevention trials. In addition, our group has identified a set, or panel of genes 
expression assays relevant to estrogen-dependent endometrial proliferation, 
hyperpl asia and cancer. The set of genes,  listed in Table 1 above will also be ex amined 
using rea l-time PCR in the pre- and post- treatment biopsies. 
 
The Ki-67 as well as the biomarkers  associated with metformin action analysis will 
be performed by the MD Anderson Core  Histology lab and read by Dr. Broaddus in the 
Pathology Core.  Q-PCR  analyses will be performed by Dr. David Loose , PI of the 
Biomarkers core. Dr. Loose  has been interested in identifying genes in huma n 
endometrium whose  expression  is altered by hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 
Over the last 5 years he has used several techniques including differential display, 
microchip array screening, and real-time quantit ative PCR to find such genes.  The 
tools he has developed are directly applicable to the investigation of surrogate endpoint  
biomarkers  (SEB s) in  HNPCC  patients treated with estrogens or estrogens plus

focused on 100 subjects. W omen > /=50 to < /=65  years old, with BMI > 30 kg/m 2, 
fasting b lood glucose < 126 mg/d l, and hyperinsulinem ia, but not frankly  diabetic are 
eligible. T hose w omen who demonstra te fasting b lood g lucose g reater t han 12 6 
mg/dl will not be referred for the st udy, and will instead be referred to contact an 
Endocrino logist from t heir insurance p rovider for ma nagem ent of d iabetes.  W omen of 
any race or et hnicity who meet the el igibility criteria will be enrolled in the st udy. Based 
on our partic ipant base, we anticip ate the m inority inclusion to be: 58 % White and Non-
Hispan ic; 30% Hispanic; and 12% African-American. 
 
Hyperinsuli nemia will be determ ined by u sing the fasting insulin and fasting g lucose 
levels to calculate the QUICK I, an index of insulin resist ance .   QUICK I = 1/ [lo g 
fasting insulin (µU/ml) + log fasting g lucose (mg/ dL)]. Values below and equal to  
0.357 will be used to identify w omen who a re insulin resis tant. [47-49 ].

Clinic  Gyneco logic  Oncology  Business  Center  on  Screening 
Visit 1 day to obtain Medical Rec ord Number  (MRN). 
 
5.2 Screening Visit 1 
 
  Screening Visit 1 includes: 
 
a.  Registrati on  at  Mays  Clinic  Gyneco logic  Oncology  Business  Center 
(MCGO BC) to obtain a Medical Re cord Number (MRN). 
 
b.  Confirm that partic ipant has fasted that day.  Review previous information 
discusse d by phone, and answer questi ons as needed. 
 
c.  Participant  to  meet  with  study  Gyneco logist  briefly  at  MCGOBC  for 
obtaining  consent  and  discussing  any  concerns  of  the  study.    Once 
conse nt is attained then participant will be sched uled for laboratory tests to  
be collected during the same day (see Table 5: Study Parameters for the list 
of laboratory test to be collected for Screening  Visit 1). 
 
d.  Pre-registration  completed  in  CORe  (See  section  5.6  for  Registration  
Process). 
 
e.  Provide participant educ ation: 
 
i. Endometrial biopsy (educ ation pack et that lists pre- and post- procedure 
instructions and contact information).    See Appendix  L for Patient 
Education Packet on Endometrial Biopsy (EMB).  
 
ii.  Taking NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) orally such as 
ibuprofen or Motrin or Advil if no prior allergies and available over 
the counter. 
 
1.  Pre-biopsy : 600 mg of NSAIDs once approximately 1 hour 
before EMB. 
 
2.  Post-biopsy: 600 mg of NSAIDs every 6 hours  as needed for 
cramps or pain. 
 
  2011-0739

 iii.  Participants who are unabl e to take ibuprofen / Motrin / Advil and have 
no allergies can also take acetaminophen (Tylenol) over the counter as 
an alternative NSAID. 
 
1.  Pre-biopsy : 325 mg acetaminophen take once approximately 
1 hour before EMB 
 
2.  Post-biopsy: 325 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours  as 
needed for cramps or pain  
 
At the Screening  Visit 1, partic ipants will be asked to complete one 24-hour 
dietary rec all during the screening visit, using NCI’s online ASA-24 system. Anytime 
between the Screening  Visit 2 and 7 days post biopsy, the participant will comple te 
two additional 24-hour dietary  recalls (one on a weekday and 1 on a weekend). These 
additio nal recalls can be compl eted by phone  or using their own home computer. 
Participants will also be given the survey pack et to be compl eted before they return 
for the Screening Visit 2.   Both the 24-hour diet recall and survey packet are 
descr ibed in detail below. All participants  will be given an accelerom eter (to obtain 
objective meas ure of physical activity), shown how to use it, and asked to wear it for 
one week between the screening visit and 
7 days post-biopsy. They will return the accelerom eter at the Screening Visit 2. If they  
are not able to return it at the second visit, they may return it by mail (pre paid  
mailer  will  be  provided)  or  at  their  first  intervention  session  (if randomized to 
receive the lifestyle intervention). 
 
 
5.2.1 24-hour Di etary Recall 
 
The  Automated  Self-administered  24-hour  Dietary  Recall  (ASA24) will  be used 
to document the partic ipant's  food intake for a total of 24 hours. Three rec alls will be 
obtained at baseline and at 4 months, at least one of which will be for a weeke nd 
day. The overview of this questi onna ire can be located at 
http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/in struments/asa24. The partic ipants will be given a 
designated url which will provide them access to t he online questi onnaire.  If the 
partic ipant does not have computer or internet access, the  recall  w ill  be  
performed  over  the  phone  with  the  assistance  of  the Res earch  Coordinator or 
Research  Dietitian.     To assist participants, the ASA2 4 utilizes graphics, pictures 
(to help approximate portion size), an an imated guide, and audio  cues and 
languages, which aid popula tions with low literacy [60]. The foods  selected by the 
partic ipants are from the USDA's Fo od and Nutrient Databas e for Dietary Studies'  
(FNDDS) most up-to-date database .            Participants will begin compl eting these 
assessments appro ximately one week before their Screening  Visit  2 and at 
four-month BRT C  visits,  with  the  third  assessment  compl eted  within  1  week  of  
the second visit/4-month visits. 
 
5.2.2 Godin Le isure Time Physical Activity 
 
A 3-item modified version of the Godin Leisure  Time Physical Activity Questi onnaire 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
16 
 will be used to measure the partic ipants' usual leisure-time exercise habits.  It will be 
administered as part of the survey packe t and will be given to the partic ipant during 
the Screening Visit and the Post-Treatment 
visit. It is easy to administer and has good test-retest reliability (.81 for total score), 
and significant correlations with VO2max. The responses from this survey at baseline 
will be used to determine if the participant is meeting guidelines for physical activity, 
as discussed in section 7, and used for randomization. 
 
5.2.3 Accelerometers 
 
At base line and month 4, participants will wear accelerom eters (Actigraph GT3 X+) 
for 7 days to provide an objec tive measu re of physical activity. Before the16  week  
assessment  staff  will  mail  the  accelerome ters  to  partic ipants along with the 
materials needed for the 24 hour recall interviews.     The accelerometer, which will 
be worn while the participant is awake, is small (1.5 x 2 inches) and can either be 
clipped to the belt or waistband  or placed in a pouc h attached to a belt that can 
be worn under clothing. Cutpoints have been established  for light, moder ate, hard, 
and very hard activity [63-65]. P articipants also will compl ete a paper-and-pencil 
exercise diary each day during the week they wear the accelerometer. The diary 
will ask partic ipants to indicate what type of exercise was performed, durat ion of 
the exercise in minutes, and the effort level during the exercise. 
 
 
5.2.4 Behavioral determinants  
 
Guide to Health Sur vey 
 
The Guide to Health survey, developed by Anders on-Bill et al,  will be used to 
meas ure Social Cognitive Theory-base d behavioral determinants (social s upport, 
self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-regulatory beha vior) rela ted to healthy 
eating patterns and physical.   The subscales have very good internal consistency 
(with the exception of one subscale with an alpha of 
.66, all are between .77 and .95); they were largely responsi ve to an online 
intervention targeting physical activity and healthy eating, and were related to 
behavior  chang e  [66,  67].  The  diet  self-efficacy  scales  measure  healthy eating 
patterns (e.g., eating more fruits and vegetables, less fat). 
 
 
 
Weight Ef ficacy Life-style (WEL)  
 
The weight efficacy life-style (WEL) questionnaire will be used to assess the 
partic ipant’s confidence that they can regulate their eating. This scale has been 
show n to have high internal consistency reliability and is responsi ve to cognitive-
behav ioral weight loss interventions [68]; it also partially  medi ated t he effect of a 
group weight loss intervention for older adults  [69]. Also,  the Guide to Health 
scales measu re self-efficacy for maintaining an exercise program over time and in 
a range of situations, but in our study of exercise with endom etrial cance r survivors 
we found  that self-efficacy for being able to physically  do  the  exercise  (task  self-
efficacy)  was  also  important  [70]. Therefore we will use the exercise self-efficacy 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
17 
 scale from that st udy (internal consist ency reliability = .96), which was base d on 
measures by McAuley [71]. 
 
 
Participant-Reported   Outcom es   Measurement   Information   System 
(PRO MIS) 
 
The Participant-Reported Outcomes Measureme nt Information System (PROM IS) 
global short form will be used to evaluate the effect of the interventions on 
participant quality of life.     This questi onnaire assesses physical  function,  pain,  
fatigue,  emotional  distress,  and  social  healthy domains. The PRO MIS global 
short form has been validated and show n to have  similar  correlations  for  the  
global  physical  health  (GPH)  and  global mental health (GMH) items as similar 
items from the SF-36 (36-item short- form health survey) and other measures of 
health related quality of life [72]. The reliabilities for GPH and GMH  were 0.81 and 
0.86 respectively which c ompared to SF-36 at 0.88-0.93 for their physical and 
ment al health  items [73]. The advantage to using the PRO MIS short form versus 
the SF-36 is that it ta kes much less time for the participants to comp lete. 
 
Self-Admini stered Comorbidi ty Question naire 
 
Becaus e   we   will   not   hav e   medical   r ecords   re adily  available   for  our 
partic ipants, the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questi onnaire will be included in the 
survey packet and be used to assess comorbidity  of the participants. The 
questi onnaire has been validated and has shown moderately strong correlation with 
the Charleston Index, which was used as a standard [74]. It displayed a Spearman 
correlation coefficient of 0.55 and kappas exceeding  
0.46 for almost every item [74]. This questi onnaire should serve as a suitable 
substit ute for the medical record. 
 
Demographic Questionnaire 
 
A basic  questi onnaire will be used to gather demographic information from each  
participant and will include questi ons on race, education, employment, and age. 
 
5.3 Screening Visit 2 
Once partic ipant eligibility is confirmed based on the blood test results from Visit 
1, partic ipant will be sched uled for Visit 2 in the following order: 
 
a) Appointment with MD Anders on’s Behavioral Research and Treatment Center 
(BRT C) for anthropome tric assessments.   The details of these measurements 
are described below in section 5.3.2. 
b) Labor atory test collection (See Table 5: Study Parameters for the list of 
laboratory test to be collected for Visit 2). 
c)  Appoin tment in Mays Clinic Gyneco logic Oncology for history, physical, and 
  2011-0739

 endometrial biopsy (EMB).  
 
 
5.3.1 Endometri al biopsy 
An endometrial pipelle biopsy will be performed at the Screening Visit 2 and at 
the 4th month on days 115-125 (plus  or minus 10 days) into treatment in all 
partic ipants from (all four arms) both groups. 
 
In  additio n  to  histologic  examination,  each  endometrial  biopsy  will  be 
examined for proliferation markers  as well as other biomarkers.  The second biopsy 
in the no treatment group is importa nt in order to determine variability in the 
biomarkers  due to sampling. In preliminary data from the Wyeth-Ayerst Stud y, we 
did see variability in certain transcript levels at the 3 and 6 month time points even 
in the placebo control  group. Therefore, we feel stro ngly in t his study that women  in 
both groups undergo a 4 month EMB. 
 
Risks of office endometrial biopsy are small, and while there are no published data 
on risk of perforation, we believe that the risk is less than 1/1000. Even in those 
partic ipants in whom uterine perforation occurs, obse rvation alone is usually 
sufficient. The severe perforations requiring laparot omy and emergent hysterectomy 
are not seen in office endometrial biopsies, rather in Dilatation and Curettage (D & 
C) procedures performed in the operating room. 
 
Participants who have  no allergies will be instructed to take orally Non- Steroidal 
Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) before and after the biopsies to reduce pain 
and cram ping.  The NSAIDs medica tions are available over the counter (See 
Section 5.2 for the recommended  dose). 
 
In the second screening visit, if the patient is experiencing discomfort while the provider is attempting to obtain the endometrial biopsy, we may administer topical lidocaine gel to the cervix. This is supported by prior studies which have demonstrated that patients may experience less pain with tenaculum placement and cervical dilation when topical lidocaine is used (Hassan et al, 2005; Davies et al, 1997). Occasionally, some patients may have cervical stenosis, which makes it difficult to dilate the cerv ix, insert the endometrial suction curette, and obtain an 
endometrial biopsy.  In these instances, prior studies have suggested that the use of vaginal misoprostol may soften the cervix and increase the likelihood that the cervix can be dilated so that the procedure can be performed (Bastu et al, 2013; Ghosh et 
al; 2013).  If cervical stenosis is encountered during the second screening visit, and the study gynecologist is unable to pass the curette or dilator through the cervix, the participant will be given a prescription for misoprostol 200mcg #2 tablets and re-scheduled to return to the clinic for a repeat attempt at performing the endometrial biopsy (within 10 days). The participant will be given instructions to self -administer 1 
tablet intravaginally th e night before the procedure and one tablet the morning of the 
procedure. Both lidocaine jelly and misoprostol will be administered as needed.  Research Nurse will counsel the participant on the common symptoms of these 
agents prior to the second screening visit.   
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
19 
  
5.3.2 Anthrop ometric assessments 
 
BRTC staff will measure the partic ipants’ height, weight, and waist circumference at 
base line and 4th month. Height will be measu red by having the partic ipant stand 
evenly without shoes on a flat surface at a right angle to the movable vertical  board 
or cap that is pulled down to lightly touch  the most superior point  of the head. Weight 
will be measured using either a standard beam scale or an electronic digital scale.   
The scale should be on a level floor, and partic ipants should  be gowned or 
wearing light clothing and no 
shoes. Waist circumference will be meas ured with the partic ipant standing relax ed 
with hands hanging at her sides on the exhale. The tension-controlled meas urement 
tape will be placed directly on the skin, horizontally around the narrowest part of the 
torso. If unable to locate the narrowest part of the waist, th e participant will be 
measured 2-3 inches above the navel. The hip cir cumference will be measu red with 
the partic ipant standing  relaxed with hands   hanging   at   her   sides   o n   the   
exhale.   The   tension-controlled meas urement tape will be placed directly on the 
skin or over the underwear, horizontally around the widest part of the hip/buttocks 
area. 
 
The   partici pant   will   undergo   a   whole   body  DEXA   to   measure   body 
composition.  The DEXA,  routinely used to determine bone mineral densit y, has 
gained support in research  application for assessing  fat and lean body mass in whole 
body and in specific body regions [23, 24, 25]. Data from each sca n will be as follows: 
percent body fat and % lean tissue, fat and lean mass for total body region as well 
as defined body zones (trunk, le g, and arms) expressed in grams. 
 
 
5.4 Randomi zation /  Visit 3 
Participants, who are eligible base d on results of the biopsy from Visit 2, will be called 
to schedule their third visit for randomization. 
 
This study will use a 2 x 2 randomized design with all 100 subjec ts being randomized: 
25 will receive both l ifestyle intervention and metformin, 25 will receive  the  lifestyle  
intervention  plus  metformin  placebo,  25  will  receive metformin   only,   and   25   
will   receive   metformin   placebo   but   no   lifestyle intervention. The participants 
randomized to the lifestyle chan ge portion  of the study will also have their first 
intervention session  schedule for the same day as well. Treatments will last 4 months. 
 
At Randomization / Visit 3, the participant will be: 
 
a)  randomized to one of the four intervention groups using the Department of 
Biostatistics Cl inical Trial Conduct  Website. See section 7.0 for details. 
b) given prescription to fill the study medi cation at the pharmacy at MD Anderson 
Cancer Center. 
 
c) partic ipant will be provided education on recording and monitoring daily intake  
of  study  medi cation  into  the  Pill  Diary.    See  Appe ndix  M  for Pill Diary. 
 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
20 
 d)  review and report side  effects of the study medication. 
 
 
 
Once the participant is randomized, the research nurse will notify the pharmacist to 
inform them of the rando mization code in order to keep study staff blinded to assignmen t 
to metformin vs. placebo. 
 
In-person toxicity assessme nts will be performed at the end of the first, second, th ird, 
and fourth  month (plus  or minus 10 days).   Phone assessments will be don e 
periodically  as needed to assess for adverse effects.   At the end of the fourth 
month of the study, the partic ipant will return for the Post-Treatment E valuation to 
repeat all measu rements (all blood tests, anthropometric assessme nts, second biopsy, 
and survey packet) taken at the Screening Visits (1& 2).  The participant will also be 
given a Satisfaction Questionnaire, based on their intervention, in advance to complete 
and return at this visit.   
 One year after baseline (+/ - 1 month), participants will be contacted to complete a 1 Year 
Follow- Up Evaluatio n. This evaluation will include anthropometrics assessments, 
including a DEXA scan, the survey packet, and blood tests collected from the 4th month visit (see Table 5: Study Parameters for the list of laboratory test to be collected for 1 
year Follow -up Ev aluation).  During this visit, the participant will also be compensated 
with a parking voucher to cover the cost of parking during the visit.  
 
5.5 Study Com pensation 
A  monetary  comp ensa tion   will   be   provided   in   the  form   of  a   gift  card 
commensurate with the amount of time, inconvenience, and discomfort experience d by 
each  partic ipant while partic ipating in the obtaining of the endometrial biopsies. The total 
possi ble compensation is $125.00 ($50 for base line and $75 for the 4 month 
assessment).   Participants who are eligible base d on the results of Screening Visit 2 
tests will receive the first gift card of 
$50.00 on the Randomization / Visit 3.  Participants  found to be ineligible base d on 
base line EMB results will be contacted by phone  and gift card will be mailed to them.     
Second gift card of $75.00 will be given after completion of all meas urements on Post-
Treatment Evaluation visit on the 4th month.  For all study rela ted assessme nt visits to 
MD Anderson each  partici pant will receive parking validation. 
 
5.6 Registration Process 
This is a phase II, four-armed, randomized chem oprevention trial. Registration will 
be a two-step pre-enrol lment to enrollment process. 
 
A. New Pa tient (participant)  Intake form will be initiated by study research nurse  
during phone interview with potential partic ipant.    Once form is compl eted, 
it will be sent to the MCGOBC to schedule  partic ipant for in-person 
registratio n.

B. At the fir st scre ening visit, partic ipant wi ll register in- person  as a new 
partic ipant at M CGO BC and will be assig ned a M edical Record Number 
(MRN ).  Afte r they have received an M RN they will m eet mom entarily with 
one of the st udy Gy necolog ist to obtain consent.  
 
C. Consented partic ipants will be registered in Clinical Onco logy Res earch 
(CORe) Syste m and will be assig ned a unique identify ing number at entry 
into the trial on the first scre ening vis it.  This unique subje ct number wil l 
not c hange during the study. 
 
D. O nly participants  who meet a ll eligibility criteria and have successfully

The Screening  Visits (1 & 2 ), Ra ndomization / Visit 3, Lifestyle intervention sessions, 
In-person toxicity assessments, an d   Post-Treat ment Evaluation wil l occu r at the 
University of Texa s M. D. Anderson Cance r Center. 
 
6.0 Treatment P lan 
 
We have chosen to treat for a 4 month period. Th is period is based on st udies 
demonstra ting  that  metform in  will  reach  full  potential  in  the  reduction  of 
hyperinsuli nemia and insulin resistance by fou r months. 
 
6.1 Treatment  
 
Prior to be ginning therapy, participants will have a basel ine endome trial biop sy 
perform ed. If the baseline endome trial biop sy re veals endometr ial hy perplasia o r cance r 
or if an off ice endome trial biopsy cannot be perfor med the partic ipant will b e removed 
from st udy. Women w ith abnormal biopsy resu lts will be referred to conta ct their  
Gyneco logist  fro m  their  insurance  prov ider  for  further  treatment  for  these res ults. 
 
The study is partially  blinded in that investigator and partic ipants will be bli nded to 
the treatment of Metform in versus placebo, but will be un-blin ded in regard to the lifesty le 
interv ention. A ll partic ipants  will be followed for at l east one month after thei r last  dose  
of study m edica tion.   All treatment-related toxicities wi ll be followed by phone un til 
resolution. All ot her partic ipants will be randomized to one of fou r arms:  
 
 
6.1.1 Metformin and Lifestyle Intervent ion

durati on. 
  The second EMB, as well as post study labs will be done  between 115- 
125 days (plus or minus 10 days). 
 
 
 
Participants  randomized  to  rec eive  no  lifestyle  intervention  (control)  will  be 
asked to continue their current eating and physical activity patterns for the durati on 
of the study. Participants randomized to the no-lifestyle conditi on will be given the 
option of receiving all study materials and up to two meetings with the dietitian after 
their final assessment and up to one month after. 
 
6.2 Lifestyle Intervention 
 
The  lifestyle  intervention  will  use  the  4  month  intervention  developed  for  the 
Diabetes Prevention Trial (DPT).  This intervention has been found to be feasible, 
result in weight loss and prevention of diabetes, and produce changes in diet and 
physical activity. The goals of the intervention are for the partic ipants to lose 7% of their  
body weight, decrease  fat consu mption, and incre ase their energy expendit ure by 700 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
23 
 kilocalories per week (equivalent to approximately 2.5 hours per week of moderate 
intensity  walking). Participants  can choose  whether they want to start with dietary or 
activity chan ges first (see Table 3 for schedule of topics), but both goal areas will be 
addressed. 
 
Strategies to encourage weight loss includ e self-moni toring of weight and reduction 
of fat intake (goal: approximately 25% of calories from fat).  Individuals who are not 
able to lose weight with these two strategies will be given a calorie goal during the 
seventh or eighth week of the intervention sessions in the session titled “Tip the Calo rie 
Balance”.   Strategies to incre ase physical activity include  self-monitoring, use of a 
pedometer to increase  activity, and provision of opportunities for exercise. 
 
The intervention is delivered as a 16 in-person sessions offered over a 4 month period, 
once each week. If a participant is travelling when a session  is schedule d, or has some 
other reason why she is not able to attend, the session can be done by telephone. 
Participants  will receive print material, worksheets,  measuring utensils, a f ood scale, 
and a pedometer. 
 
All print materials have been developed by the DPT and are available for use; they 
will require only minor modi fications for this study.  Print material and worksheets to 
be given to partic ipants are provided in Appendix  G .  The intervention also involves 
providing opportu nities for supervised exercise (e.g., group exercise class,  group walks) 
at least twice a week for partic ipants. The 16 interventions sessions will be del ivered 
by a master’s level Research  Coordina tor or Research Dietician who will be trained 
in a manner consist ent with the requirements  of the DPT .   For quality control, 10% of 
the sessions he/she conducts will be audio-recorded and reviewed by Dr. Basen-
Engquist or a Senior R esearch  Coordinat or or R esearch Manager.

6.3 Supervised Exercise Session 
 
Two opportunities for supe rvised exercise per week will be offered for partic ipants to 
incre ase their level of physical activity. Any other form of exercise will be arranged by 
the participant herself outside the institution. 
 
6.4 Toxicity asse ssment 
 
The summary of toxicity assessme nt for in-person and phone is listed below. 
 
A. In-person assessment include: 
o physical exam (only on 1st month) 
o weight 
o review of study medi cation side effects (as listed in conse nt and instruct 
partic ipant  to  call  if  they  experience  symp toms  of  abdominal  pain, 
anore xia, nause a, jaundice, and chang e in urine color) 
o ALT and creatinine levels. 
o Dispen se Pill Diary and prescr iption. 
 
B. Phone assessment include reported symptoms of: 
o gastrointestinal (abdom inal pain and severe diarrhea) 
o liver (jaundice) and review ALT lab results 
o kidney (changes in urine color and amount) and review creatinine lab 
results 
o heart ( CHF) 
o rare side effects listed in cons ent 
 
 
The in-person t oxicity assessment will be at the end of each month and will be a month 
from Randomization / Visit 3.   All partic ipants must agree to keep a drug administration  
diary (Pill Diary).  This diary will be signed by both the participant and res earch  nurse 
and reviewed during each clinic visit to verify compl iance. The medi cation administration 
record will be filed in the participant's chart. Any discrepan cies will be noted along with 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
25 
 the rea son, if known. Any remaining pills will also be returned at each clinic  visit and 
docu mented. 
 
Participants with mild elevations in ALT (3x ULN ), will continue study drug at same dose , 
and have another ALT drawn 30 days later.  If ALT levels are >/= 4x ULN,  the study 
drug will be stopped, and partic ipant removed from the study.   Participants with an 
elevation in creatinine of >/= 2.5x ULN will be taken off of the drug and removed from 
the study.  The study drug will be stopped and participant removed from study if the 
participant reports symptoms of congestive heart f ailure (CHF) s uch as:  fatigue,  
tightness  or  cong estion  in  the  chest,  edema  to  ankles  or  lower extremities, and 
shortn ess of breath. 
 
Telephone contacts will be made  periodically as needed  to assess on the first, second, 
third, and fourth  month (plus  or minus 10 days) to encourage compliance and assess 
for the presenc e of toxic or adverse effects.  Participants experiencing toxic or adverse 
effects will be referred to MD Anderson health  providers for medical care however 
medi cal care will be billed to the partic ipant or participant’s  insurance provider.  All 
partic ipants  will be contacted by telephon e 4 weeks  after completion of the study for 
follow-up and toxicity assessment. 
 
7.0 Data Monitoring Plan 
 
Participants will be randomized to one of the four arms: metformin, placebo, and 
metformin / placebo and lifestyle intervention using t he Department of Biostatistics 
Clinical Trial Conduct Website (CTC website).   Participants  who do not meet these 
criteria will be considered nonev aluable, removed from study and will not be counted 
toward the actual accrual goal. We plan to accrue 100 evaluable participants.  
 
We will use a form of adap tive random ization called minimization, which is similar to 
stratification in that participant characteristics are used to assign them to the treatment 
conditio ns [75, 76].     Minimization results in better group balance with respect to 
partic ipant charac teristics.   In minimization, before a p articipant is   assigned   to   
a treatment group, the total numbers of participants  in each group with similar covariate 
charact eristics are totaled. The totals are based on the marginal sums of the covariates 
so that each covariate is considered separately. The treatment assignment of a 
partic ipant is determined based on which group would provide the best overall balance 
with respect to those covariates. Covariates that will be used in randomization of 
partic ipants in this study are BMI, age, and whether the participant meets current 
guidelines for exercise recommended by the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans . 
These guidelines recommend that adults  enga ge in moderate physical activity at least 
150 minutes per week or in vigorous activity 75 minutes per week [77]. The baseline 
level of activity for each partic ipant will be meas ured when they compl ete the Godin 
questi onnaire, which is part of their survey pack et, which will be compl eted before their 
Screening  Visit 2 appoin tment. The Research Dietitian/R esearch Coordinator will 
determine if the participant is currently  meeting these  recommendati ons and provide 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
26 
 this data to the Research Nurse for randomization. 
 
Randomization will be performed by the research  nurse  using the website created 
by the Department  of Biostatistics.  The research nurse  will then inform the pharmacist 
of randomization group (A, B, C, or D) for study drug administration. The Research 
Dietitian/R esearch   Coordinator   who   is   in   charge   of   administering   the   lifestyle 
intervention will be given access to the randomization website  and informed of lifestyle 
intervention randomization code to deter mine whether the participant has been 
randomized to the lifestyle intervention. 
 
 
7.1 Protocol compl iance and assessment of t oxicity data 
 
The attending  physician  must see each participant prior to beginning study drug. All 
required interim and pretreatment data should be available to evaluate toxicities, assign 
grade, and make a determination regarding continuing treatment.  
 
 
7.2 Data collection Plans 
 
Protocol data will be entered into the following plans: Clinical Oncology Research 
System (C ORe) / Protocol Data Management System (PD MS), Access Database, ASA 
server, MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC ) Beha vioral Science server, and excel 
spreadsh eet after each  course  of therapy.  A brief explanation for required but missing 
data should be recorded as a comment.  See below for the list of the speci fic data stored 
in PDM S and CORe : 
 
 PDM S 
 Monthly medication administra tion dates 
 Doses taken 
 Laboratory results 
 Clinic visits  
 Diagnostic test (EMB) 
 CORe  
 Pre-registration  
 Adverse events entry 
 
All behav ioral and anthropometric data components,  including height, weight, waist and 
hip circumference, exercise diary, and survey packe t data will be collected and kept in 
an Access Databas e. The ASA24 data is stored on the ASA site’s server until we 
request the data for analysis. The data is sent to us within 48 hours and then the file is 
stored on our server.  The Accelerometer data will also be stored on our server at 
MDACC (Departm ent of Behavioral Science) until the statistician  retrie ves the data 
for analysis. The DEXA scan data is downloaded into a file such as excel 
(Departm ent of Behav ioral Scie nce) and then is stored on the server as well.

 8.0 Crite ria for Rem oval from the Study 
8.1  Subjects are free to leave the study a t any ti me. 
8.2   Particip ants may be removed from the st udy at the d iscretion  of the investigato r 
if there is sufficient reason to suspect t hat the participant is not compl iant with 
the st udy requirements. 
8.3  If at any time during the st udy, the participant ex periences sy mptoms of congestive 
heart failure or renal failure, drug will be st opped and the partici pant taken o ff 
study. 
8.4  Abnormal basel ine endome trial biopsy or the endome trial biopsy is unable to be 
perform ed. 
8. 5   No n-compli ance: Non-comp liance will be def ined as a pa rticipant m issing more 
than 4 c onsecu tive doses per mon th or a total of more than 10 doses during the 
4 month peri od. 
8.6   Lost to follow- up: Dil igent attemp ts must be made by te lephone and letter to 
determ ine the circum stances fo r loss  to follow- up, since loss may be related to 
study d rug. 
9.0 Statistical Considera tions  
 
This is a pa rtially  blind ed, ra ndomized st udy to evaluate the ef fects of intervention upo n 
Ki-67 and ot her biomarkers.  Pa rticipants and researchers will be bli nded with regard to 
assig nment of study d rug (placebo vs. met formin) but they wi ll not be bli nded 
with re gard to assig nment of lifesty le intervention.   We will use a form of a daptive 
randomiza tion called m inimiza tion, which is similar to stratification in that participant 
charact eristics a re used to assign them t o the treatment condit ions to achieve bet ter 
group balance.   Groups wi ll be balanc ed wi th regard to age (50-65 y ears ), BM I (Class 
I and II : 30.0-39.9 and Class III or g reater: ≥40), and w hether t hey meet current 
exercise guideli nes as recommended by the Phy sical Activity Gu idelines 
forAmericans.  
 
The pri mary objec tive of th is study is to evaluate the effect of interv ention (metformin 
and/or life style intervention) on Ki- 67.  Sec ondary endpoin ts include ex amination of 
intervention on: 
 
(a) genes relevant to estrogen depen dent e ndometrial proliferation, hy perplasia 
and cancer u sing Q-PCR (PCN A, sFRP4, RALDH2, IGF-1R, survivin, an d 
EIG121), 
 
(b)  biomarkers   specif ic   to   the   effec t   of   metform in   treatmen t   (phospho- 
AMPKa, phos pho-ACC, phos pho-mT OR and phospho- S6 ribosoma l protein. 
 
Additio nally,   we   wil l   ex amine   change s   in   seru m   levels   o f   estradiol,   estrone, 
testoste rone, DHEA-S, sex hormone bi nding gl obulin (SHBG), adiponectin, g lucose,

 HbA1c, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and all biobehav ioral outcomes, 
such as changes in body composit ion, physical activity, quality of life (QoL ), diet, etc. 
 
We will analyze differences in Ki-67 and other outcomes using 2x2 ANO VA models.  
If lifestyle intervention is found to affect change in Ki-67 expression or other outcomes, 
we will use the methods descr ibed by Baron and Kenney [78] to determine whether 
these chang es were medi ated by weight loss, body composition  changes, physical 
activity chang es, and  dietary chan ges.    D ifferences  between  arms  with  regard  to  
adverse events and other toxicities will be examined using Fisher’s exact tests.  
Changes from base line lab values will be examined 2x2 ANOVA models.  
A study of Ki-67 change in participants at high risk for endometrial cance r (Lynch 
patients) indicated we could  expect a mean decrease in Ki-67 of 3.5 (after log - 
transformation) in the Metformin alone group with a standard  deviation of 0.8.  For 
the purposes of estimating power, we assumed that the lifestyle intervention alone 
group would have the same mean and standard deviation decre ase, but we halved 
mean decrease for our calculations to take into account the non-compliance  we might 
obse rve in this group.  Finally, we estimated power for a moderate interaction effect – 
half of the metformin intervention effect in addition to the additive effect of metformin 
and lifestyle intervention.  Specifically, we calculated power assuming that the mean 
decreases in the control arm, metformin alone arm, lifestyle intervention alone arm 
and metformin plus lifestyle intervention arm were 0, 3.5, 1.75 and 7, respectively.  
Using a 2-sided test with 5% statistical significance, we will have over 95% power to 
detect these differences when the common standard  deviation is 0.8.  Additional ly, we 
will still have adeq uate power to detect much smal ler differences.   For example, we 
will have 80% power to detect a lifestyle alone main effect of 0.3 and still have over 
95% power to detect a metformin main effect and an interaction effect of 0.6 and 1.2, 
respecti vely, when the common standard  deviation is 0.8.   Power was calculated using 
PASS 2005 (copyright 
© 2005, Jerry 
Hintze). 
 
All testing will be 2-sided with 5% statistical significance.  The primary efficacy analysis 
will be intent-to-treat.  Patients who discontinue early from the study will be included  
in the analysis as not having a chang e from baseline values.  Additionally, we will use 
the methods descr ibed by Benjamini and Hochberg [51] to  control the false discovery 
rate in the secondary efficacy analyses. 
10.0 Reporting Requirements 
 
A data safety monit oring board  (DSMB) at MD Anders on will monitor the trial annually 
for safety.

Criteria for response  and toxicity: 
10.1 Adverse Event 
Any unfavorable or unintended symptom, sign, or disease (including abnor mal lab) 
temporal ly associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or 
may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. Such effects can 
be intervention related, dose related, route related, partic ipant rela ted, and cause d by 
an interaction with another drug. 
 
10.2 Serious Adverse Event 
Any  adverse  drug  experience  occurring  at  any  dose  that results  in  any  of  the 
following outcomes : 
• Death 
• A life-threatening  adve rse drug experience  – any adverse experience  that 
places the participant, in the view of the initial reporter,  at immediate risk of 
death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include  an 
adverse experience  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
cause d death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial disruption of a 
perso n’s ability to conduct normal life functi ons. 
• A cong enital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
10.3 Eliciting Adverse Event Information 
Adverse events will be elicited at each clinic visit during partic ipation in the study. 
Participants will be given frequent toxicity screening  (in-person and phone) to review 
the occurrence of adverse events monthly and throughout  the study. All adverse events 
which are directly obse rved and all adverse events which are spont aneously re ported 
by the partic ipant are to be documented by the investigator. 
 
10.4 Grading/ Rating Scale 
All adverse events reported during the study will be evaluated and graded on a scale 
of 0-5. The CTCAE version 4.0 will be used to determine the grade for all toxicities. 
For any adverse events which are not listed in the CTCAE version 4.0 the following 
rating system will be used as listed below in section 10.5. 
 
10.5 Non-NCI Adverse Event Grading Scale Grade/Description  
0  No adverse event (absent) or within normal limits 
1 Mild adverse event (minor, no specific medical intervention, asymptomatic laboratory 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
30 
 findings only, radiographic findings only, marginal clinical relevance) 
2  Moderate adverse event (minima l intervention, local intervention, non-invasive 
intervention [packin g, cautery]) 
3 Severe and undesirable adverse event (significant symptoms requiring 
hosp italization or invasive intervention; transfusion; elective interventional 
radiological procedure;  therapeutic endosc opy or operation 
4  Life  threatening  or  disabling  adverse  event  (complica ted  by  acute,  life 
threatening  metabolic or cardiovascula r complications such as circulatory failure, 
hemorrhage, sepsis.  Life-threatening physiologic consequences; need f or intensive 
care or emergent invasive proce dure; emergent interventional ra diological 
procedure therapeutic endoscopy  or operation 
5  Death related to adverse event 
 
10.6 Relations hip to Study Treatment  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the 
adverse event to the study treatment: 
 
Definite: Adverse event is cle arly related to the study treatment. 
Probable: Adverse event is likely related to the study treatment. 
Possible: Adverse event may be related to the study treatment. 
Unlikely : Adverse event is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
Not Related: Adverse event is cle arly not related to the study treatment. 
 
11.0 Laborator y Evaluations  and Pr ocedures 
 
11.1 Laborat ories 
 
11.1.1  Serum assays will be performed at the MD Anders on Cancer Center Clinical 
Labora tory (estradiol, estrone, testosterone, DHEA-S, SHBG, adiponecti n, 
glucose, hemoglobin, FSH,  A1c, insulin and IGF-1). 
 
11.1.2    The endometrial biopsy slides will be reviewed centrally  by the study's 
co-PI, Russell Broaddus, M.D., Ph.D. at MD Anderson Cancer Center 
and PI of the Pathology core.  A pathology report will be generat ed and 
forwarded to the partic ipant's study gyneco logist. 
 
Cases  with  hyperplasia  or  adenoc arcinoma  will  be  confirmed  by  a 
second review by Elvio Silva, M.D., a  senior  gyneco logical pathologist at 
MDAC C.  Dr. Silva is a Professor with more than 25 years of experience 
and is regarded as an international expert in  gyneco logic pathology. 
 
11.1.3 Ki-67 immunohistochemical assays, as well as IHC for metformin associated

 phosphoproteins, will be perform ed in the Histology Core  Lab at MD 
Anderson. 
 
11.1.4  Q-PCR for estrogen-regulated genes will be perform ed in the laboratory 
of David   Loose -Mitchell,   Ph.D.,   U.T.   -Houston   Medical   School 
(Biomarkers core). 
 
11.2 Collec tion and Handling Procedures  
 
An endometrial biopsy using 4 mm pipelle will be used to obtain endometrial tissue. Half  
of the sample will be placed in formalin, and half of the sample will be placed in a 
cryovial and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.  The sample in formalin will 
undergo routine histological-processing and paraffin-embedding.  One H&E slide will be 
cut per block.   Following central pathologic review, the pathology report will be 
forwarded to the partic ipant's study gyneco logist. 
 
11.3 Shipping I nstructions  
Snap frozen tissue will be batched and shipped  periodically  on dry ice to Dr. David 
Loos e-Mitchell at the University of Texas - Houston Medical School,  PI of the 
Biomarkers Core.  
 
Snap frozen tumor will be shipped in liquid nitrogen to M. D. Anderson Gyneco logic 
Oncology Translational Research Tumor Bank. 
 
 
11.4 Experimental Methodolog y and Pr eliminary Results 
 
11.4.1 Handling of  Endometri al Biopsi es 
Once the endometrial biopsy has been performed,  half of the biopsy will be flash- 
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the remaining half will be fixed in formalin.  RNA will be 
extracted from the frozen portion for the Q-PCR assays.  The formalin-fixed portion 
will under go routine histological processing  and paraffin embedding.  One H&E  
stained slide will be prepared for histological diagnosis.  Additiona l paraffin 
embedded tissue will be used for immunohis tochemical Ki-67 assay and metformin-
associated biomarkers (p hopho-IHC). 
 
11.4.2 Pathologi cal Examin ation of  Biop sies 
A gynecologic pathologist (Russell Broaddu s, M.D., Ph.D.,Co-PI and Pathology 
Core  PI)  will  review  all  of  the  endo metrial  biopsies.    Difficult  cases  will  be 
reviewed with a senior consu ltant (Elvio Silva, M.D., leader  of the Gyneco logic 
Pathology  Group,  Departm ent  of  Pathology,  M.D.  Anderson  Cancer  Center). 
The  biopsies  will  be  placed  into  diagnostic  ca tegories,  such  as  proliferative 
phas e, secretory phase, atrophic, anovulatory, hyperplasia,  hyperplasia  with atypia, 
or carcin oma, according  to standard pathological principles.

11.4.3 Frozen Tissue E xperiments - Quantitative PCR analysis of Tr anscript in 
Endometri al Tissues 
The  Q-PCR  analyses  will  be  per formed  in  the  Quantitative  Genomics  Core 
Facil ity at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.  This portion  of the 
project  will be under the direction of David Loos e-Mitchell, Ph.D. (Biomark ers 
core PI) and Greg  Shipley, Ph.D.     This laboratory has been interested in identifying  
genes  in  human  endometrium  whose  expression  is  altered  by hormone  
replacement therapy (HRT).    Over the  last  3  years  we  have  used several 
techniques includ ing differential display, microchip array screening, and rea l-time 
quantitative PCR to  find such genes.  The tools we have developed are directly 
applicable to the investigation of surrogate endpoint  biomarkers  (SEBs). 
Identification of appropriate biomarkers  is essent ial for this study.   An ideal 
biomarker  is a histological or molecular "red flag" that precedes the onse t of cancer. 
Ideal surrogate endpoint biomarkers  are quantit ative and are modulated by 
chem opreventive agen ts. 
 
In our prior endo metrial cance r chemoprevention study of women with HNPCC, we 
evaluated   a   panel   of   30   biomarkers   thought   to   be   relevant   in   endometrial 
carcinogenesis.  From that st udy, we have narrowed down the field to a subset of 5 
validated, estrogen-regulated genes and a proliferation mark er[46].

12.1 Preparation of  RNA from Endometri al Biopsies for Re al- Time Q-PCR 
 
Total RNA will be isolated from endometrial samples using a Qiagen RNeasy Kit 
(Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and a modification of the manufacturer's protocol.

 Endom etrial samples containing 5-20ng of tissue will be placed in 1.0 ml freshly 
prepared  lysis  buffer  containing  10mM  b-mercaptoethanol.  The  tissue  is 
homogenized with a Brinkman PT3000 (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury NY) set 
at 30,000 rpm using a small diameter probe (PTDR3007).  
 
The lysate will be centrifuged at 1000xg for 5 minutes to reduce foam and remove 
debris. The supernatant will be placed in a 1.5ml microfuge tube and the lysate spun at 
full speed for 3 minutes.  An equal volume of 70% ethanol is added to the lysate and 
mixed thoroughly. The Qiagen columns are loaded  (x3) with 700 ml of the lysate/ethanol 
mixture and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 s. The RNA is bound  to the column  matrix 
and the flow through discarded. After all of the lysate mixture is loaded onto the 
column, it is washed with 700 ml of wash buffer RW1. The column is then centri fuged 
at 10,000 rpm for 15 s. and a new receiving tube is attached. The second wash is with 
500 ml was buffer RPE at 13,200 rpm for 60 s. The RNA is eluted from the column  
into a new microfuge tube by applying 55 ml DEPC-treated H20 treated directly to the 
column and centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 60 s. RNA is quantit ated by A260.  In our 
previous studies on 290 post-menopau sal women, this procedure yielded  an average 
of 16.7 mg per sample (min 0.11, max 117 mg). In that  same  study,  230  samples  
were  from  HRT  treated  women  and  yielded  an average of 37.3 mg of total RNA. 
 
We typically  measu re transcripts in 10-20 ng of total RNA.   Some of the more abundant 
RNAs can be measured in as little as 1 ng; in fact, we measu re 18S rRNA from a dilution 
that contains 0.025 ng. If we assume we will need  an average of 20 ng per sampl e 
per transcript times 4 per quadru plicate determinations, then we will require 80 ng per 
transcript.  To measu re the 8 transcripts will require 640ng of RNA. This is less than 1/5 
of the average amount of RNA recovered from untreated post- menopausal women.  In 
our recent study, this was obtained in 87% of our post- menopausal, untreated women  
and in 100% of the samples from treated women. We should be able to recover 
sufficient RNA from nearly all samples to perform a compl ete analysis; in that small 
percentage where RNA becomes limiting we will prioritize our ass ays as descr ibed 
later in this section. 
 
12.2 Analysis of Q- PCR Transcripts 
 
Transcripts for the 7 genes will be assayed in RNA prepared as descr ibed above. 
For each  transcript, compatible PCR primers and a fluorescent hybridization probe 
(TaqM an probe) will be designed using Primer Express (PE Bi osystems). PCR 
conditions  will be optimized for primer and probe concentration and Mg2+ 
conce ntrations to give assays with a slope of the sRNA standard curve of -3.1 - -3.5 
(PCR cycles per log  template molecules) and a lower detection limit of <102 molecules 
input template. Assays will be assembl ed in a 96-well plate in which 12 wells are 
allocated to sR NA standards  (102 - 107 sRNA molecules), 2 wells are assigned to 
controls  (no amplification and no template controls) and 80 wells are allocated to RNA  
samples. We have found that optimal  data is achieved when RT- PCR analyses of 
unknown RNA 's are run in triplic ate, and we always includ e a 4th aliquot of each sample 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
34 
 without added reverse transcriptase (to detect amplification of resid ual genomic DNA). 
Using this format of 20 RNA samples are analyzed per 96-well plate. Plates are 
assembled robotically and the RT and "real-time" Q-PCR runs will be carried out in 
the ABI 7700.     The level of input RNA  in unknown sampl es is calculated by 
interpolation of the Ct value  of the  unknown on  a  sRNA standard  curve  run in 
paral lel with the unknown samples.  The results of the assay are reported as the number 
of template molecules in the input unkn own RNA.   Because of occasional 
inaccuracies  in RNA quantitation using spectro photometric analyses, we will determine  
the level of three  nor malizer transcr ipts  (b-actin,  cyclophilin, and  1 8S rRNA) in 
each  sample.  Results are then normalized to these three transcripts and are 
expressed as % normalizer mRNA. 
 
12.3 Real-Time Q-PCR 
 
96- well plates will be assembled robotic ally using Tecan and Biomek workstations. 
Aliquots  of  the  RNA  (10-20  ng)  will  be  reverse  transcribed  with  SuperScript  II 
reverse  transcriptase  (1  U/ml;  Boeringher  Mannhei m)  in  a  10  ml  reaction  that 
includes the appropriate transcript-speci fic reverse primer (300 nM), 1X RT  buffer 
(Gibco-RL), 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, and 500 mM dNTPs.  The reaction will be 
incubated at 50°C  for 30 minutes and then terminated by incubation at 72°C for 5 
minutes. Following reverse transcr iption of 40 ml of "real-time" PCR reaction mix is 
added to give a final volume  of 50 ml.  PCR is perform ed in a 7700 Prizm Sequenc e 
Detector (Perkin Elmer) with preheating at 95°C for 1 minute followed by 40 cycles 
of  annealing  and  extension  (60°C  for  60  s.)  and  melting  (95°  C  for  12  s.). 
 
Dequench ing of the fluoresc ent hybridization probe is continuously monit ored and 
the  Ct  (PCR  cycles  to  threshold)  calculated  using  Sequenci ng  Detector  1.6.3 
software (P erkin Elmer).  Unknown RNA samples  will be analyzed in triplicate with a 
control  that lacked reverse transcriptase (-RT control). Samples are run in parallel 
with sRNA standards (0.8 pg - 80 pg) to g enerate an internal standard curve (Ct versus 
sRNA templ ate molecules). The number of template molecules in the sample is 
calculated by interpolation of Ct against the sRNA standard curve. 
 
Amplicon specific sRNAs are generated from appropriate plasmid templates by first 
synthesizing the target amplicon using t he same PCR primers used in the "real-time" 
PCR reaction. The amplicon is then cloned into the pCRIItopo plasmid (Invitrogen) 
that includes a T7 site flanking the cloning cassette. sRNA is synthesized from the 
T7-tailed amplicon template using T7 Mega-script Polymerase (Ambion). sRNA is 
quantit ated by 32P-UTP incorporation and checked for purity by gel electrophores is and 
analyzed on a phosp horimager (Molecular Dynamics). Aliq uots of sRNA containing 
know n numbers  of template molecules are reverse transcribed and subjec ted to real-
time PCR in  paral lel with unkn own RNA samples  to quantify transcript abundance. 
12.4 Logistics of Re al- Time  Q-PCR  
 
  2011-0739  
  May 13, 2013 
35 
 The studies outlin ed in this proposa l that use frozen specimens total 7 transcripts in 
40 women  at 2 time points.   This will require 30 Q-PCR runs on a 7700.   We 
currently  operate 2 ABI 7700 instruments and average throughput  is 3 runs per machine 
per day.  Therefore we estimate that the proposed studies can be done in 5 ma chine 
days. 
 
12.5 Databases and Data Storage for Real- Time  Q-PCR 
 
Data is exported  electronically  from the 7700 and initial calculations (means of triplic ate 
samples) are performed on a custom spreadsheet.  The raw 7700  data and the 
preliminary calculations are archived on CD-ROM.     These  data are then electronically  
transferred to a custom Filemaker Pro database which performs all of the final 
calculations.  Changes to the data contained in the Filemaker database  are all logged 
to a separate, passw ord-protected audit database.     The Filemaker database  is 
archived to magnetic tape. 
12.6 Immunohi stochemistry 
 
Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and phospho-AMPKa, phosp ho-ACC, phos pho-mTOR 
and phos pho-S6 ribosomal  protein will be performed in the Histology Core  Lab, 
using paraffin-embedded tissue sections and commercially available antibodies. The 
perce ntage cells positive will be recorded, as well as the compartment stained (ep ithelial 
cell vs. stromal  cell); nucleus vs. cytoplasm  vs. cell membrane). Dr. Bro addus will 
evaluate the immu nohistochemistry slides.

Protocol No:  DFN -15-CD-010  
Protocol Title:  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Efficacy, 
Tolerability, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Single Doses of DFN -
15 in Post -Surgical Dental Pain.  
Study Drug/  
Investigational 
Product : 1. DFN -15 (celecoxib oral solution, 25 mg/mL) - Test product  
2. Placebo of DFN -15 (oral solution, 0 mg/mL of celecoxib)  
DFN -15 and placebo will be supplied in bottles containing a deliverable 
volume of 4.8 mL solution.  
Doses of DFN -15 (62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg) and placebo will be 
allocated on site for each subject by drawin g the appropriate  amounts 
of DFN -15 and /or placebo solutions into syringes , based on each 
subject randomized treatment arm . Regardless of DFN -15 dose, t he 
total volume administered to each randomized subjec t will be the 
same (10 ml) given as a single oral dose  to ensure blinding is 
maintained . 
Country:  United States of America  
Phase:  2 
Primary Objective:  To assess the analgesic efficacy of DFN -15 in acute pain (post -
operative pain following extraction of bilateral mandibular third 
molars), when administered as a single dose of 62.5 mg, 125 mg or 
250 mg, as compared to placebo.  
Number of 
Subjects:  An adequate number of subjects will be screened in order to 
randomize 120 subjects into the study. Subjects who discontinue 
study participation after randomization and prior to completing the 
study will not be replaced.  
Trial Design:  This is a randomized, do uble -blind, placebo -controlled parallel design 
study, to be conducted at 1 -3 centers in the United States. Male and 
female subjects, 18 to 60 years old (inclusive), who are scheduled to 
undergo elective bilateral lower third molar extraction  will be 
enroll ed.  Subjects who  meet all of the inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria  in the protocol will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
in a double -blind fashion to receive a single oral dose of either DFN -15 
62.5 mg, DFN -15 125 mg, DFN -15 250 mg or matching placebo.   
Subjects will undergo a screening procedure (within 28 days of the 
scheduled extraction of the impacted  third molars) that will involve

mass index ( BMI ), urine pregnancy test (women of child -bearing 
potential,) medical and medicinal history, physical examination,  
dental examination,  vital signs measurement (blood pressure, pulse 
rate, respiratory rate), clinical laboratory investigation (hematology, 
serology, coagulation parameters, serum chemistry and  urinalysis), 
12-lead ECG and a  panoram ic x-ray to document the impacted 
mandibular third molar teeth.  
At screening and upon admission /Check -in (Day 1) to the clinic, prior 
to dental surgery, subjects will be screene d for alcohol consumption 
and illicit  drug use by alcohol breathalyzer test and urine drug screen, 
respectively.  
As a pre -requisite for randomization, subjects will be required to 
report “moderate” to “severe” baseline pain on the provided paper 
diary with in 6 h post -surgery (Baseline period) as characterized on a 
4-point categorical pain intensity  (PI)  scale (0= none, 1= mild, 2= 
moderate, 3= severe), and a score of ≥5, on the 11 -point Numerical 
Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) where 0 represents ‘no pain’ and 10 
represents ‘worst pain imaginable’. Eligible subjects will be 
randomized and will receive a single dose of the assigned study 
treatment (a total volume of 10 mL). The start time of dosing will be 
recorded as T0.  Subjects will be randomized and administered  the 
study medication within 15 minutes of meeting the post -operative 
inclusion criteria (baseline score).    
Subjects with inadequately controlled pain symptoms may request 
rescue analgesic medication.  The rescue medication for this study will 
be 1 -2 oxy codone 5 mg/acetamino phen 325 mg q 4 h PRN. Subjects  
will be encouraged to delay using the rescue medication if their pain is 
tolerable until 120 minutes post -dose of study medication. A subject 
who is administered rescue pain medication will continue completing 
pain assessments until 8 hours after treatmen t initiation.  The use of 
ice packs will not be allowed in the 8 -hour observation period.  
All randomized subjects will be provided with a paper di ary to record 
pain assessments.  A patient training program will be implemented to 
ensure that all subjects und erstand the relevant scales and 
assessments prior to study participation. At study medication 
administration, two stopwatches  will be started , to measure times to 
‘perceptible’ and ‘meaningful’ pain -relief. Subjects will be instructed to 
stop the first sto pwatch when they first perceive pain relief to occur 
(time to perceptible relief). Subjects will be instructed to stop the 
second stopwatch when they first experience meaningful pain relief 
(time to meaningful relief). Stopwatch times of perceptible relief  and

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 7 of 81 meaningful relief will be recorded  using exact stopwatch  time  
displayed . 
The following efficacy assessments will be completed by the subjects 
at 15, 30, and 45 min and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after 
study medication administration, as well as within 5 minutes prior to  
first use of rescue medication and at early termination from the study, 
if it occurs. Subjects will be asked to record responses for the 
following assessments, in order:  
1. Pain intensity using the 11 -point Numerical Pain Rating Scale 
(NPRS).  
Followed by:  
2. Pain relief (PR) using a 5 -point categorical scale (where 0= no 
pain relief, 1= little pain relief, 2= some pain relief, 3= a lot of 
pain relief, 4= complete pain relief)  
In addition, at 8 hours post -dose or within 5 minutes prior to first use 
of rescue medication (whichever is earlier), subject s will be asked to 
record within the provided patient diary:  
1. ‘Patient Rating of Treatment S atisfactoriness’ using a 5 -point 
verbal rating scale (0 =poor, 1 =fair, 2 =good, 3=very good, 4 
=excellent).  
Subjects wi ll remain NPO (nothing by mouth ), including water, from 
Check -in (i.e., at least 2 hours before the administration of the dose of 
study medication to randomized subjects ) until 2 hours post -dose , on 
Day 1 (study day) . After 2 hours post -dose, subjects may be permitted 
to consume water, or gelatin snacks. Subjects are prohibited from 
ingesting solid foods or carbonated beverages for at least 6 hours 
post -dose.  
12-lead ECGs will be performed before surgery, at baseline (before 
administration of the study treatment) and repeated at 1, 2, 4 and 8 
hours post -dose, with a window period of ± 45 minutes for each 
timepoint. Vital sign parameters ( sitting pulse rate , sitting  or supine  
blood pressure and respiratory rate) will be measured and recorded 
before surgery, at baseline, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours (before discharge), 
with a window period of ± 30 minutes for each timepoint. Vital signs 
may be performed concurrently with ECG if supine position is 
performed. Safety vital signs and ECG may  be performed prior to 
initiation of efficacy assessments should they coincide , with priority 
designated toward efficacy assessment timepoints . At discharge (8 
hours post -surgery) from the clinical facility, all AEs reported for the 
subjects will be reviewed. A physical examination, including 
evaluation of the incision site for hematomas, and clinical laboratory

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 8 of 81 evaluation (coagulation parameters and specific hematology, serum 
biochemistry and urinalysis parameters) will be conducted.   
All subjects will have blood drawn at specified time points for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be 
drawn immediately prior to dosing a nd at 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1.0, 
1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 hours post -dose , to estimate the 
concentrations of celecoxib, using a validated LC -MS/MS method. 
Whenever the times of PK blood sample collection coincide with the 
efficacy or safety a ssessments, the PK sample may be drawn within ± 
5 minutes of the scheduled time in first hour and within ± 10 minutes 
of the scheduled time after the first hour, at each timepoint, 
immediately following the efficacy assessments. The exact clock time 
of sam ple collection will be recorded and used in the PK analysis.  
Subjects will return to the research center 7 days ( ± 3 days) post -
surgery for evaluation of their safety and well -being. Any  AEs 
experienced post -surgery  will be reviewed.  A physical examination, of 
the subject will be performed , 12-lead ECG, and vital signs parameters  
will be repeated.  Hematology, coagulation parameters, serum 
biochemistry and urinalysis parameters will be repeated  only if there 
is a clinically significant abnormality or ongoing AE(s) . Any changes to 
the prior and concomitant medication made after discharge will be 
reviewed and recorded.  
Treatment:  A single dose of total volume of 10 mL of oral solution will be 
administered providing DFN -15 (62. 5 mg, 125 mg or 250 mg) or 
placebo . The dose will be prepared by a designated unblinded 
pharmacist at site, as per the randomization schedule. Designated 
blinded study staff will dose subjects and administer study 
assessments. Blinded study staff will rema in blinded to the dose 
administered to each subject throughout the study .  
Study Duration:  The duration of study participation will be approximately 39 days, for 
randomized subjects, including a screening period of approximately 
4 weeks, surgery and treatment period day (subjects will be confined 
within the clinical study facility for at least 8 hours post -dose) and a 
post -surgery/  treatment follow up visit to the research center up to 10 
days post -surgery.  
Study Visits:  Total number  of visits to the  clinical facility: 3  
Visit no. 1 (Day -28 to Day -1): Screening

• Proportion of subjects reporting treatment satisfacti on 
outcome as either 2 = good, 3 = very good or 4 = excellent, on 
the 5 -point categorical scale  
• Time to use of rescue medication and percentage of patients 
using rescue medication  
• Pain intensity difference at each NPRS time point (15, 30, and 
45 min and 1 , 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 h)  
• Pain relief at each time point (15, 30, and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 h)  
• Characterization of plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of DFN -
15 doses in fasting conditions (using C max AUC 0-t, Tmax; Other 
pharmacoki netic parameters like AUC 0-0.25, AUC 0-0.5, AUC 0-0.75, 
AUC 0-1, AUC 0-2, AUC 0-3, AUC 0-4, AUC 0-6 will also be calculated ) 
Secondary/  
Exploratory  
Endpoints:  Additional analyses may be performed and pre -specified in the SAP 
as appropriate.  
Statistical and PK 
Methods:  The SAP will supersede the protocol in case of a discrepancy.  
Sample Size:   
120 subjects will be randomized into the study in (1:1:1:1) ratio i nto 
one of 3 doses of active study medication or placebo.   
All safety and efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics by treatment group and time point. Descriptive statistics will 
include (n, arithmetic mean , standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum) for continuous variables, categorical variables will be 
summarized with counts and percentages.  
Analysis Populations:   
• Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population will include all 
subjects who are randomized, take the assigned dose of the study 
medication and complete at least one post -baseline pain 
assessment.

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories          
Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 15 of 81 • Safety Population will include all subjects receiving any amount of 
study medication.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
SPID6 values will be analy zed using an ANCOVA (analysis of 
covariance) model with treatment as the main effect; the baseline pain 
intensity ( PI) score will be added to the model as a covariate.  Analgesic 
effect of DFN -15 at each dose level will be evaluated compared to 
placebo usi ng Dunnett’s test.  Imputation methods for rescue use and 
missing data due to early termination will be specified in a statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) prior to database lock.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses:  
Other SPID and TOTPAR endpoints will be analyzed us ing similar 
methods as the primary analysis.  Time to meaningful and perceptible 
pain relief and time to rescue will be summarized graphically with 
Kaplan -Meier curves and compared across treatments using the log -
rank test.  Proportion of subject s reportin g treatment satisfaction 
outcome will be summarized and treatments compared using Chi -
Square techniques.  
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses:  
Similar analysis methods will be used for any exploratory endpoints.  
Safety:   
All safety parameters and changes from b aseline will be summarized 
descriptively by treatment arm and time point. No statistical testing 
will be performed.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Key pharmacokinetic endpoints will be C max, AUC 0-t and T max. Other 
pharmacokinetic parameters like AUC 0-0.25, AUC 0-0.5, AUC 0-0.75, AUC 0-1, 
AUC 0-2, AUC 0-3, AUC 0-4, AUC 0-6 will also be calculated. Any other 
additional parameters requiring estimation will be included in the PK 
Analysis Plan.

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 25 of 81 1. INTRODUCTION  
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Limited  is developing DFN -15, a new formulation of celecoxib 
[p-[5-p-Tolyl -3-(Trifluoromethyl) pyrazol -1-yl] benzene sulfonamide] for the indications 
of: (1) acute treatment of migraine with or without aura, and (2) management of acute pain 
in adults.  This study  is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetic properties of dosing with three doses of  DFN -15 (c elecoxib; 62.5 mg, 
125 mg, and 250  mg) in a postoperative pain population.  A single -dose, dose ranging 
design using the oral surgery model will be used to provide useful data in terms of 
analgesic onset, single -dose duration  of analgesia , and effect size of pain-time curves 
during an 8 -hour evaluation period of postoperative pain. Plasma conc entrations and 
calculated Pharmacokinetic parameters will be used to determine the concentration -effect 
relationsh ips for efficacy and safety . Efficacy assessments will attempt to identify the time 
to onset of analgesia, the duration of analgesia, and magn itude of analgesic effect in 
comparison with placebo.  
NSAIDs produce meaningful analgesia without opioid associated side effects such as 
sedation, nausea and vomiting1 and they have a low risk of abuse and dependence2.  
NSAIDs, such as celecoxib, that sele ctively inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 (COX -2) target the 
prostaglandins (synthesized via COX -2) responsible for inflammation and pain while 
sparing the prostaglandins responsible for maintenance and protection of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract (synthesized inv olving COX -1)3. The analgesic efficacy of 
COX -2 selective NSAIDs is similar to nonselective NSAIDs4 but celecoxib has reduced 
incidence of upper GI ulcers and bleeds and less GI upset5,6,7 ,8. Data suggests that 
selective COX -2 inhibitors may be safer in the immediate pre - and peri -operative 
periods, especially with respect to the incidences of bleeding9,10, incisional wound 
hematomas, gastro -intestinal ulceration11, and they may not impact bone fusion and 
wound healing12. 
DFN -15 (Celecoxib Oral solution) is a new liquid oral formulation of the selective 
inhibitor of the type 2 (inducible) isoform of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, celecoxib.  
Celecoxib is approved as an oral capsule formulation, Celebrex®, for the management of 
acute pain in adults. DFN -15 conta ins celecoxib in solution at concentration of 25 mg 
per mL , and is  formulated using self -micro -emulsifying Drug Delivery System 
(SMEDDS) technology for quicker absorption . In comparative bioavailability studies in 
healthy subjects, Celebrex was seen to rea ch peak plasma concentrations at 
approximately 3 hours (T max)13, whereas, the DFN -15 oral liquid formulation has a more 
rapid celecoxib absorption rate leading to a higher peak plasma concentration within one 
hour.  Moreover, DFN -15 provides higher systemic  exposure (as determined by the 
calculated partial AUC, AUC 0-2h) than Celebrex®, 400 mg in the first 2 hours after 
dosing ( Pharmacokinetic results from studies DFN -15-CD-008, DFN -15-CD-003, as 
presented in DFN -15 Investigator Brochure edition 3.0 ). On account of the unique 
physic o-chemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics of DFN -15, it is expected to 
provide a quicker onset of analgesia and better relief early on in acute pain, such as post -
surgical pain.

3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  2, randomized, double -blind,  parallel group, dose-ranging placebo -
controlled evaluation of the analgesic efficacy, safety , tolerability  and pharmacokinetics 
of DFN -15 in adult subjects who experience post -operative pain after undergoing 
bilateral third mandibular molar extraction.  The study will randomize  approximately 
120 subjects across 1 -3 sites.  
Subject s will be at least 18 years to 60 years of age and will be schedule d to undergo 
elective bilateral mandibular  third molar extraction under local anesthesia.  The 
mandibular third molar s must involve a full or partial bony impaction confirmed by 
radiographic evidence  (panoramic x -ray). 
After signing the informed consent : demographics, medical /medicinal  history, physical 
examination  (including height , weight  and BMI) , dental examination, baseline  clinical  
laboratory testing, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, urine 
pregnancy testing  (females of child bearing potential)  and urine drug and alcohol screen  
will be completed during the screening visit.  
On the day of surgery (Day 1), prior to surgery, eligibility will be confirmed through 
updating medic al/medicinal history, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign 
measurements, urine pregnancy testing (females of child bearing potential), urine drug 
and alcohol screen, and review of inclusion exclusion criteria.  A patient training 
program will be implemented to ensure that all subjects understand the relevant scales 
and assessments prior to study participation.  Eligible subjects will undergo bilateral 
mandibular third molar extractions.  Subjects who experien ce acute postoperative pain 
of ‘moderate ’ to ‘severe ’ intensity , on a 4 -point categorical pain intensity scale (0= none, 
1= mild, 2=  moderate , 3= severe ), within 6 hours following the end of su rgery, and a 
pain intensity ≥ 5  on an 11 -point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), will be eligible for 
randomization and will stay at the study center for at least approximately 8 hours after 
treatment initiation.  
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria in the protocol  
will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a single oral dose of  DFN -15 62.5 mg, 
DFN -15 125 mg, DFN -15 25 0 mg  or placebo. The time of the study drug administration 
will be designated as T 0. 
Subjects will be domiciled at the research facility during the first 8 hours after initiation 
of study drug treatment.  For safety and welfare of the subject, t he site may choose to 
have s ubjects stay overnight at the study center .  An 11-point numerical pain rating scale 
(NPRS)  will be used to determine the intens ity of pain , 0-10 where 0 is ‘no pain ’ and 10 
is ‘worst  imaginable pain ’.  NPRS

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 28 of 81  assessments will  be performed at: baseline , 15, 30, and 45 minutes, and at 1 , 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after study drug administration (T 0). Also at these time points, Pain 
Relief (PR) will be assessed using a 5 - point categorical scale.  (where 0= no pain relief, 
1= little pain relief, 2= some pain relief, 3= a lot of pain relief, 4= complete pain relief) . 
Numerical pain rating scale (NPRS)  and pain relief (PR) assessments  will also be 
completed before taking any dose of rescue medication , and at time of early 
discontinuation  (if it occurs) .  The time to first perceptible pain relief and time to 
meaningful p ain relief will b e determined using the ‘two stop watch ’ method.  Subjects 
will also complete a  Patient Rating of Treatment satisfactoriness  at 8 hours aft er 
treatment initiation (prior to discharge from the clinical research center) , or immediately 
prior to the time of first rescue analgesic administration , or at time of early 
discontinuation .  Serial vital signs and 12  lead ECG will be done as indicated in Section 
6.4. 
For time points where several procedures are scheduled, the following sequence will be 
followed:  12-lead ECG, Vital signs, Pain assessments (where applicable) , PK blood draw , 
clinical labora tory (where applicable) . 
Subjects with inadequately controlled pain symptoms may request 1-2 oxycodone 5 mg/  
acetaminophen 325 mg q 4 h as needed  as rescue analgesic medication .  For subjects 
who require additional analgesia, additional analgesic medication may be administered 
per the surgeon’s standard of care.   
Post rescue analgesic administration, subject s will continue completing pain assessments 
until 8 hours after treatme nt initiation.  However, these assessments will be disregarded 
in the statistical analysis.  
Subjects should be encouraged to wait at lea st 2 hours after the first study drug 
administration before utilizing rescue analgesia, if possible.  As much as possib le, rescue 
analgesic medication should be administered only if pain intensity ( PI) prior to rescue is 
≥4 on the numerical rating scale.  
A maximum of  twelve 4  mL blood samples will be taken fro m each partic ipant at baseline 
and 15, 30 , and 45 minutes,  and a t 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6,  and 8 hours  after study drug 
administration for analysis of plasma celecoxib concentrations. Whenever the times of PK 
blood sample collection coincide with the efficacy or safety assessments, the PK sample 
may be drawn within ± 5 minutes of the scheduled time in first hour and within ± 10 
minutes of the scheduled time after the first hour, at each timepoint, immediately following 
the efficacy assessments. The exact clock time of sample collection will be recorded and 
used in the PK analysis.  
Subjects will be asked to return to the study site 7 days ( ±3 days) post -surgery for 
evaluation of their safety and well -being. A review of AEs experienced post -surgery, a 
physical examination,  12-lead ECG, and vital signs  will be rep eated.  Hematology, serum 
biochemistry , coagulation  and urinalysis parameters will be repeated  only if there is a 
clinically significant abnormality or ongoing AE(s) . Any changes to the prior and 
concomitant medication that are made after discharge will be reviewed and recorded.  
Efficacy assessment s will include numerical pain rating scale  (NPRS ) for pain intensity , 
pain relief  (PR) , use of rescue medication,  and Patient Rating of Treatment

3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control Groups  
This study will evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetic prope rties 
of a known drug substance a dministered via a n alternative formulation/dosage form .  
This study will explore the analgesic effects of dosing with DFN -15 (a solution of 
celecoxib)  in an accepted model of postoperative pain.  Third molar extraction  produces 
generally reliable and persistent pain symptoms for a period typically lasting over 24 
hours, which will allow for analysis of single dose analgesic properties .  
Pharmacokinetic evaluations will allow determination of exposure in patients with acute 
postoperative pain and examination of any exposure -response relationship for DFN -15 
doses .  Efficacy measures will be collected in order to gain a better knowledge of the 
onset of analgesic effects, as well as characterizing the duration and extent of analg esic 
effects following a surgical procedure.  These analgesic effects will be evaluated 
between t hree potentially effective doses of DFN -15 in comparison with a placebo 
control.

assignment.  Male and female subjects (approximate ratio of 1:1)  who meet all of the 
inclusion criteria (including postoperative inclus ion criteria) and none of the exclusion 
criteria  will be stratified.  
5.6. Selection of Doses  
The selection of doses of DFN -15 to be evaluated in this exploratory study is based upon 
pharmacokinetic modelling using data from PK studies of DFN -15 in healthy subj ects, 
and from the exposure -pain intensity response relationship that is reported for 
Celebrex® in acute pain.   
5.7. Selection of Timing of Dose  
Subjects will receive a single dose of study medication.  Study drug  will be administered 
if the subject achieves ad equate pain symptoms (i.e. NPRS ≥5  out of 10 and pain of 
‘moderate ’ or ‘severe ’ intensity  on a 4 -point categorical pain intensity scale ) to be 
randomized in the study.  The exact time of study drug administration  start will be 
recorded in the subject’s CRF .   
5.8. Blinding and Unblinding of Study Medications

of the four bottles into each of the four 2.5 mL dosing sy ringes, and provide the blinded 
dosing syringes containing the oral solution dose  to the blinded  staff member/s , who will 
administer the study medication as per Section  5.3. 
The study site will be provided with  individually sealed envelopes identifying the study 
medication each subject receives in the study.  The treatment for an individual subject may 
be unblin ded in the event of an emergency , or if the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan for that subject depends on which study medication he or she received. In 
the event of emergent medically necessary unblinding,  the blind may be broken by rem oving 
the code break envelopes  provided for the assigned randomization number without 
breaking the code for any other subject.   
Unless the subject is at immediate risk, the investigator must make diligent attempts to 
contact the designated Medical Monitor  before unblinding the subject’s data. If a subject’s 
data are unblinded without the prior knowledge of the Medical Monitor , the investigator 
must notify the Medical Monitor  as soon as possible and no later than the next business 
morning. All circumstances  surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented.  
The sealed randomization envelopes should be stored in a locked area with controlled access 
until required to break the blind in the event of an emergent condition in a treated subject.    
5.9. Treatment Compliance  and Safety  
Designated s tudy personnel will directly administer  study  medication  with designated 
study personnel verifying medication administration . Time of medication administration 
(T0 = time of dosing) will be recorded into the CRF.  
Study investigators will review the investigational brochure prepared for DFN -15 in 
order to be aware of the safety related events which may be anticipated with its use.  A 
fully stocked emergency crash car t, defibrillator, oxygen, and personnel trained in 
emergency resuscitation will be available at the study center at all times during the 
confinement period.  
5.10. Drug Accountability  
The investigator (or designee) will sign for the study medic ation when received  and will 
conduct an inventory of the supplies and verify that study drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts before completing a supplies receipt .  The inventory of 
supplies at the study site may be checked at any time during the study  by the unblinded 
monitor.   The study medication must be handled and stored as described and dispensed 
only to those subjects formally enrolled  in the study.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator (or designee) to ensure that the study drug has 
been correctly documented for the amount received and dispensed.  A full drug

6.3. Demographic and Efficacy Assessment  
6.3.1.  Demographics  
Demographics information will be collected during screening visit including age, sex, 
ethnicity, race, weight, height, and BMI  and recorded into source and CRF as Kg/m2. 
6.3.2.  Medical /Medicinal  History  
The Investigator or designee will document each subject’s medical  and medicinal  history 
during the screening visit.  Medical  and medicinal  history will be updated on Day  1 
when the subject is admitted to the study unit, and the subject inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to confirm that they continue to meet the required st udy 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
6.3.3.  Physical Examination  
The Investigator or designee will perform a physical examination (HEENT, 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, dermatologic, and 
musculoskeletal systems) during the screening  visit, after completion of the 8 -hour post-
dose efficacy and safety assessments (prior to discharge ,) and at the end of study visit on

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 43 of 81 Day 7 .  Body weight and height will be measured, and BMI will be calcu lated during the 
screening visit  only.    
The stud y Investigator may perform a physical examination (the extent of which is 
determined by the study investigator) at any time during the study if indicated by change 
in a subject’s medical history or condition.  
6.3.4.  Dental Examination  
At the screening visit, the  Investi gator or designee will perform a  panoramic x -ray 
documenting the impacted mandibular third molar teet h. An oral examination will also be 
performed as part of end of study assessment to ensure incision wound healing is 
progressing as expected . 
6.3.5.  Pain Intensity : 4-Point Categorical Pain Intensity  (PI) and Numerical 
Pain Rating Scale  (NPRS )  
PI will be assessed using Numerical pain rating scale  (NPRS)  by the study subject , 
following training on how to perform the assessment, for their current tooth extraction 
pain according to an 11 -point numeric pain rating scale (0 - 10) where 0 equates to ‘no 
pain’, and 10 equates to ‘worst  pain imaginable ’.  See Append ix B.1: Pain Intensity 
Assessment . 
After surgery, when the subject is sufficiently awake to be able to follow directions, 
subjects will be assessed for postoperative inclusion criteria.   Subjects will be eligible 
for randomi zation if pain intensity  is reported as ‘moderate ’ or ‘severe ’ level on a 4 -
point categorical pain intensity (PI) rating scale (with categories of ‘none ’, ‘mild’, 
‘moderate ’, or ‘severe ’), plus an N PRS score ≥5  (scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘no pain ’ 
and 10  is the ‘worst pain imaginable ’).  The 4-point categorical rating scale for pain 
intensity will be completed only at baseline .   
Subject s will be randomized and administered the study medication within 15 minutes of 
meeting the post-operative inclusion  criteria  (baseline score) .   The N PRS score 
completed prior to randomization  will be utilized as the baseline pain intensity score.  
T0 is t he time of first study drug administration.  
NPRS  will be performed at: baseline, then 15, 30 , and 45 minutes , then at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 , 
5, 6, 7, and 8 hours  after treatment initiation  (T0).  Pain intensity assessments will also 
be completed before taking first rescue medication dose  (within 5 minutes prior to 
rescue dose ) and/or at time of early discontinuation . All assessments should continue per 
protocol even after rescue is taken.  
There will be a ± five (5) minute window allowed for the timing of  each pain intensity 
assessment in the first 2 hours post T0 then a ±1 0-minute window for subsequent PI 
assessments.    
As much as possible, rescue analgesic medication should be administered only if PI 
prior to rescue is ≥4 on the numerical  pain rating sca le (NPRS) .

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 44 of 81 6.3.6.  Pain Relief (PR)  
Pain Relief (PR) will be assessed by the study subject according to a 5-point 
categorical scale,  whe re (where 0= no relief, 1= little relief, 2= some relief, 3= a lot of 
relief, 4= complete  relief) .  See Appendix B.2 : 5-Point Categorical Pain Relief 
Assessment . 
PR will be assessed at: 15, 30, and 45 minutes, then at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours 
after treatment initiation (T 0).  PR assessments will also be completed before taking first 
rescue medication dose, (within 5 minutes prior to rescue dose) and/or at time of early 
discontinuation.  
There will be a ± five (5) minute window allowed for the timing of each PR assessment 
in the first 2 hours post T0 then a ±10 minute window for subsequent PR assessments.   
6.3.7.  Time to Perceptible Pain Relief  and Time to Meaningful Pain Relief  
Time to perceptible pain relief and time to meaningful pain relief will be measured using 
the ‘two stopwatch ’ method.  For each randomized subject, two stopwatches will be 
started immediately after administration of the first study dose (T0).  The first st opwatch 
will be given to each subject with the instructions to stop the watch when they first 
perceive pain relief to occur ( ‘time to perceptible relief ’).  Once the first watch is 
stopped, the second stopwatch will be given to the subject with the instruc tions to stop 
the watch when they are first experiencing meaningful pain relief ( ‘time to meaningful 
relief ’).  The stopwatch  times to perceptible and meaningful pain relief wil l be recorded 
in the subject’s CRF.  
6.3.8.  Patient Rating  of Treatment satisfactorines s 
Subjects will be asked to evaluate the performance of their study medication as a pain 
treatment in response to the following inquiry; “Please rate how well your pain has been 
controlled since you received study medication?  0-poor, 1 -fair, 2 -good, 3 -very good, or 
4-excellent.”   See Append ix B.3: 5-Point Patient Rating of Treatment 
Satisfactoriness . 
The assessment  will be completed  at 8 hours after treatment initiation , prior to discharge 
from the research center  (before 8-hour post -dose PK and safety  lab collection ), or at 
least 5 minu tes prior to first rescue analgesic dose , and/or early discontinuation . 
6.4. Safety Assessments Description  
6.4.1.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
During the screening visit, at the 8-hour discharge  or early discontinuation , subjects will 
have blood samples collected for routine clinica l laboratory testing.  Clinical laboratory 
testing should only be performed at the end of study visit on Day 7 if there is a clinically 
significant abnormality or ongoing AE(s). The hematology, coagulation  profile,  serum  
chemis try, and serology parameters , as well as urinalysis  parameters  that will be 
evaluated  at each of these times is listed in  APPENDIX C : PANEL OF CLINICAL 
LABORATORY TESTS    
In addition, a u rine drug screen and alcohol breath test  will be conducted  at the 
screening visit, and during admission /Check -in to the study unit on Day  1.  Urine drug

methamphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), benzodiazepines, barbiturates, methadone, 
oxycodone, ecstasy  (MDMA) , and propoxyphene.  
Urine pregnancy testing will be completed at the screening visit, at prior to surgery  on 
Day 1 and at the end of study visit at Day 7 .  
Clinical safety laboratory test will also be collected at time of termination from the study 
for subjects who prematurely discontinue study participation.  
6.4.2.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Resting vital  signs (VS) will include resting blood pressure, resting pulse  rate, and 
respiratory rate . Resting tests must be obtained after resting (seated  or supine  with ECG 
leads connected , consistently applied ) for ≥ 5 minutes.  Resting v ital signs will be 
collected at screening, Day 1 prior to surgery, at pre-dose baseline, and the n at 1, 2, 4 , 
and 8  hours after the administration of study medication, or at time of early 
discontinuation , and at the end of study visit on Day 7  (± 3 days) . Screening  resting  vital 
signs will be done in 3 determinations about 2 minutes apart to ascertain subject’s true 
baseline heart rate and blood pressure values.   
Vital signs may be checked at additional times on an ad hoc  basis per the judgment of 
the Investigator or study staff.  VS will have a ±30-minute window.  
Actual times will be recorded for all events, and any deviation outside the specified 
health y subject ranges must be clearly documented in the subject’s study records .  The 
Investigator or the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor may exercise his/her judgment to 
terminate a subject ’s participation in the study due to clinically significant changes in 
any clinical par ameter.  
6.4.3.  Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead ECG will be completed for all subjects at screening, Day 1 prior to surgery , at 
pre-dose baseline, and at 1, 2, 4,  and 8 hours after treatment initiation  or at time of early 
discontinuation , as well as at the end of study visit on Day 7  (± 3 days) .  At the 
Screening Visit, the 12-lead ECG will be used to exclude subjects with a clinically 
significant abnormal ECG.  ECGs will have a ± 45 minute window.  
The fi ndings (i.e., classification as “normal”, “abnormal not clinically significant” or 
“abnormal clinically significant wil l be recorded in the subject’s CRF.   
6.5. Assessments by Visit  
6.5.1.  Screening Visit

8-hour post dose time point  should be collected at  the time of early study termination  (if 
it should occur) . 
6.5.5.  End of Study Visit (Day 7 ± 3 days ) 
The following end of study safety assessments will be conducted for all subjects during 
the end of study visit on Day 7 . 
• Physical examination ( Section  6.3.3 ) 
• 12-lead ECG ( Section  6.4.3 ) 
• Resting Vital signs ( Section  6.4.2 )

• Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential ( Section  6.4.1 ) 
• Monitori ng of AEs and concomitant medications (Section 7) 
Change in concomitant medications after discharge will be documented  and reviewed . 
Clinically significant adverse events, examination or test results will be followed until 
appropriate resolution can be documented.  
In the event of early termination (ET), every attempt should be made to have the subject 
return to the site to complete procedures listed within this section and in APPENDIX A : 
.  
The efficacy measures utilized in this study are commonly used in clinical studies 
performed in acute postoperative pain populations.  The timing of assessments is 
intended to evaluate the time to onset of analgesia, duration o f effect and magnitude of 
benefit.  
The selected pharmacokinetic sampling times and parameters are appropriate to support 
the objectives of this study.  Sample times will allow evaluation of the rate and extent o f 
absorption of the study dose , and help in e stablishing exposure -response analysis, if any .  
Safety measures used in this study are standard for clinical trials of investigational 
medications.  
6.6. Clinical Stopping Rules  
This study will be discontinued if it is determined that there is a significant sa fety risk 
posed towards study subjects.  Potential safety risks will be evaluated continuously 
throughout the course of enrollment in the study.

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 49 of 81 7. ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting 
the criteria and definition of an Adverse Event ( AE), Serious AE ( SAE ), or Serious 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SSAR) as provided in this protocol.  During the study, 
when  there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be responsible for 
detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol.  
7.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with th e use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, 
whether or not con sidered causally associated with the use of the study medication.  Any 
abnormal laboratory value deemed clinically significant by the investigator, regardless 
of causal relationship, must be reported as an AE.  
Examples of an AE include the following:  
• signi ficant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or 
indication under study  
• exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either 
an increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (e.g., abnormal physical 
exam ination finding)  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study 
medication or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as 
an AE or SAE, unle ss non -serious or serious sequelae occur)  
• symptoms or behavior suggesting cognitive or psychiatric disturbance  
The following examples are not considered AE’s : 
• medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy), although the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do 
not worsen  
• the disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or 
symptoms of the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more 
severe or occur with a greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition  
All AE’s , whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and 
regardless of causality or seriousness, will b e assessed and recorded in the CRF 
beginning after administration of study medication through the final follow -up 
assessment (approximately 7 ± 3 days after the last study drug administration).  AE’s 
will b e assessed and recorded after administration of study medication through the Day 7

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 50 of 81 visit (see Sections  7.2 and 7.3). In addition, if the investigator becomes aware of the 
occurrence of a SAE  within 30 days of the last visit, the SAE should be reported as 
outlined in Section  7.7. 
7.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• It results in death or is life -threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred).  (This criterion is not intended to include an AE 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, mi ght have caused death.)  
• It results in persistent or substantial disability or incapacitation.  (This criterion is 
not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance, 
such as uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.)  
• It results in hospitalization.  
• It results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization.  
• It is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• It requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in determining whether an AE is 
serious when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent any of th e other outcomes listed.  Examples of such 
medical events that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not resul t in hospitalization.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of an SAE.  
Social or convenience admission to a hospital or prolongation of a hospitalization for 
social or convenience reasons not associated with the occurrence of an AE does not meet 
the definition of an SAE.  
7.2.1.  SAEs  That Occur Before Administration of Study Medication  
Before administration of study medication, only SAEs assessed by the investigator as 
relate d to study participation (e.g., related to study procedures or a change in existing 
therapy) will be transcribed onto the SAE reporting form and reported to the sponsor.  
7.2.2.  SAEs  That Occur After Study Completion  
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE or d eath that occurs in a subject more than 
30 days after the subject receives study medication and that investigator considers the 
event to be related to the study medication, the investigator is obligated to report the 
SAE to the sponsor.

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 51 of 81 7.3. Definition of a Sus pected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A SAR is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the adverse event was caused by the study drug.  For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence  to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means 
any adverse event caused by a drug.  
7.4. Definition of a Serious Suspe cted Adverse Reaction (SSAR)  
A SSAR is any Suspected Adverse Reaction that is determined to be serious, based on 
the outcomes of a SAE described in Section  7.2; i.e. death, life -threatening, causes or 
prolongs inpatient hospitalization, causes a persistent of significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
abnormality/birth defect.  
7.5. Recording and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to collect all adverse events (AEs), serious and 
non-serious, derived by spontaneous, unsolicited reports of subjects, by observation and 
by rou tine open questionings e.g., "How have you felt since I last saw you?"  
For randomized and enrolled patients, AEs will be captured from the time of signing of 
Informed Consent Form until End of Study or Early Termination. Adverse events/ 
Serious Adverse Eve nts (SAEs) should be followed to resolution, stabilization, or until 
30 days after the last dose of the study drug upon which patients will be referred to their 
primary medical provider for follow -up. 
All adverse events, including observed or volunteered p roblems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
Subjects should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the 
Investigator, after signing the Informed Consent.  Investigators should make an 
assessment for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate 
adverse event eCRF.  
Pre-existing conditions will be recorded in the subject’s source record and eCRF on the 
Medical History or appropriate page.  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) will be defined as an AE that begins or that worsens 
in severity after at least one dose of study drug has been administered.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g., ECG) findings that 
are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen during 
the study should be reported as adverse events.  
The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinic ally 
significant. Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study 
will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically 
significant. The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of  the event on the 
PROTOCOL DFN -15-CD-010 
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories          
Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 52 of 81 basis of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not 
the individual signs or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE.  
Adverse event reporting will extend from signing of informed consent unti l End of Study 
visit /Early Termination visit. All AEs, regardless of the relationship to study drug, will be 
recorded in the subject source record and eCRF.  Standard medical terminology should be 
used when describing AEs. The anatomical location of the A Es must be specified where 
applicable.  
 
7.5.1.  Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study, using his or her clinical judgment.  The intensity of e ach AE and SAE 
recorded in the CRF should be assigned to one of the following categories:  
• mild:  an event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, 
and does not interfere with everyday activities  
• moderate:  an event that is suffic iently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
• severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity  is a term 
used to describe the intensity of a specif ic event, and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as severe.  The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as a severe headache).  This is not the same as serious,  which is based 
on the subject’s or event’s outcome or on a ction criteria usually associated with events 
that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning (see Section  7.2). 
7.5.2.  Assessment of Causality  
The in vestigator is obligated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  The investigator 
will assess the relationship to the study medication by using the following criteria : 
• Definitely Related :  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  
The AE is most  likely explained by study drug.  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if 
possible) are positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study 
drug.  Anot her etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely . 
• Probably Related :  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  
The AE is more  likely explained by study drug than by another cause.  
Dechallenge (if performed) is positive.  
• Possibly Related :  An AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug.  
The AE could have been due  to another equally likely cause.  Dechallenge is 
positive.  
• Not Related :  The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no 
temporal relatio nship to study drug OR the AE has a much more likely alternate

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 53 of 81 etiology OR the AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of 
another drug . 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it 
is important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event 
before transmitting the SAE report ing form and completing the AE CRF page(s).  The 
causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting  
requirements.  The investigator may change his or her opinion of causality in light of 
follow -up information and amend  the SAE reporting form and AE CRF page(s) 
accordingly.  
7.5.3.  Assessment of Outcome  
All SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the cond ition stabilizes, the events 
are otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator will assess 
the outcome of the event by using the following terms:  
• Recovered/ Resolved :  The event resolved or the subject recovered without 
sequela e.  An event (either serious or non -serious) occurred and had an endpoint, 
and the subject experienced no restrictions.  Examples include stent placement 
for coronary artery disease (a device implanted is not a sequela), an 
appendectomy (a scar is not a se quela), a postoperative wound infection, or an 
upper respiratory tract infection.  
• Recovered/ Resolved with sequelae :  The event has at least one  secondary 
outcome that may result in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both.  
Such sequelae are us ually limited to SAEs.  Examples include hip replacement 
resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of 
surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or emboli formation after a bacterial 
infection resulting in a renal infarct an d loss of renal function.  
• Not Recovered/ Not resolved :  At the end of the study, a non -serious event 
either has not changed in intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, 
and the outcome is unknown.  Examples include headache, low -grade fever, o r 
nausea.  
• Unknown : The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to 
follow -up, and the status of the event is unknown.  
• Fatal  
7.5.4.  Assessment of Expectedness  
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, adverse events and suspected adverse events 
should be assessed as being expected or unexpected.  An AE or SAR is considered 
unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity 
or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not requi red or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 54 of 81 7.6. Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Non-serious AEs will be followed after the last sche duled study visit, until an 
appropriate resolution can be documented.  
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow each subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition.  All AEs and 
SAEs docume nted at a previous visit or contact are designated as ongoing and will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits or contacts.  
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follo w-up.  The investigator will ensure that 
follow -up information provided to the sponsor includes results of any additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with 
other healthcare professionals that serve to c larify the nature of the event, the cause of 
the event, or both.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE repor ting 
form and entered into the CRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by the 
investigator.  The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor 
within the time frames outlined in Section  7.7. 
7.7. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, 
he or she must notify the sponsor (both Medical Monitor and Pharmacovigilance 
Contact) within 24  hours.  
Any SAE or any outcome of death due to any  cause, which occurs, during the 
course of this study, regardless of relationship to study medication, must be 
reported to the sponsor immediately (within 24 hours of site knowledge).

SAE Reporting Instructions : 
1. All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event). 
Please email the signed, scanned copy of the completed SAE form to  SAE@drreddys.com  
and MedicalMonitorDFN -15-CD-010@lotuscr.com  or fax the completed SAE form to 
fax number: +1 908  450  1510 . 
 
2. An email acknowledgement of receipt of SAE will be sent to the reporting site within one 
business day.  
 
 
In the initial e -mail, the investigator must provid e to the sponsor the following CRF 
pages, completed to the greatest extent possible:  
• AE record  
• medical history  
• prior and concomitant medications  
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic 
test results, or medical reports relevant to the SAE.   Subject’s full names should be 
redacted from any documents  that are not CRFs  to protect the subject ’s identity .  The 
subject initials and subject numbers should be added to these documents as identifiers.  
E-mail/ E-Fax transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information.  In rare 
circumstances and i n the absence of e -mail capacity, notification by fax is acceptable .  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he or she must not 
wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event.  The 
form must be  updated when additional information is received.  Follow -up information 
received on all SAEs must be forwarded to the sponsor by using the same procedure and 
timelines as for an initial report.  
7.8. Regulatory Reporting Requirements  
The investigator must prom ptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the 
procedures detailed in  Section  7.7, “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the 
PROTOCOL DFN -15-CD-010 
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories          
Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 56 of 81 Spon sor.”  Reporting of SAEs to the Regulatory Authorities will be the responsibility of 
the Sponsor. Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be 
reported to the  Regulatory Authorities.  The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, 
as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about 
the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  Prompt notification of SAEs by the 
investigator to the appropriate project contact for SAE receipt is essential so t hat SSARs 
that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence be reported and legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects are met.  
Investigator letters are prepared according to sponsor policy and are  forwarded to the 
investigators as necessary.  An investigator letter is prepared for any SAR that is 
attributable to study medication, serious, and unexpected.  The purpose of the 
investigator letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and Good Clinical Pra ctice (GCP) 
requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply 
with requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC.  It will be 
Investigator/CRO responsibility to report the SAE to all the participating Investigators 
during the study.  
7.9. Precautions  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product must be 
discontinued immediately, the subject should imm ediately be withdrawn from the study 
and early termination study procedures must be performed. The subject must be 
followed through the pregnancy and delivery and up to 4 weeks after delivery for infant 
status.  
Pregnancy occurring during a clinical investi gation, although not considered a SAE, 
must be reported by the Investigator to Sponsor within the same timelines as a SAE 
(within 24 hours). The Investigator should report the event to the Sponsor immediately 
and com plete the Pregnancy Report Form  (see Section  7.7 for contact information).  
The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy should be 
included in this info rmation. The I nvestigator is instructed to contact the subject every 3 
months until the end of her pregnancy and report t he outcome to the sponsor. The 
Investigator is instructed to contact the subject for 4 weeks after delivery for follow up 
on infant sta tus. 
Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the 
Pregnancy Report Form.  
The following outcomes of pregnancy fall under the criteria for serious adverse events 
and should be reported as such: delivery complications,  spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
death of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried/stillborn fetus.

8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of 1 20 subjects for this study was selected empirically without  a formal 
statistical assumption.  However , group sizes of 30 -40 per group are typically sensitive in 
the dental pain model to detect acute drug effects.  
8.2. Study Endpoints  
8.2.1.  Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the summed pain intensity diff erence over the first 
6 hours (SPI D6) between DFN -15 doses and placebo . The comparison of primary 
interest is DFN -15 doses vs. placebo . 
Key s econdary efficacy variables will include the following:  
• Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) over 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours using a 5 -point categorical scale 
(TOTPAR2, TOTPAR4, TOTPAR6 and TOTPAR8)  
• Summed Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) at 2, 4 and 8 hours post -dose (SPID2, SPID4 
and SPID8)  
• Time to perceptible and meaningful pain relief as measured by two stopwatch 
technique  
• Proportion of subjects reporting treatment satisfaction outcome as either 2 = good, 3 = 
very good or 4 = excellent, on the 5 -point categorical scale  
• Time to use of rescue medication  and percentage of patients using rescue medication  
• Pain intensity difference at each NPRS time point (15, 30, and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, and 8 h)  
• Pain relief at each time point (15, 30, and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 h)  
• Characterization of plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of DFN -15 doses in fasting 
conditions (using C max AUC 0-t, T max; Other pharmacokinetic parameters like AUC 0-0.25, 
AUC 0-0.5, AUC 0-0.75, AUC 0-1, AUC 0-2, AUC 0-3, AUC 0-4, AUC 0-6 will also be calculated ) 
Additional exploratory analysis will be performed and pre-specified in the  Statistical 
Analysis Plan  (SAP ). 
The comparison of primary interest in the study is DFN -15 250 mg dose versus placebo. 
The other comparisons include DFN -15 125 mg versus placebo, DFN -15 62.5 mg versus 
placebo and between two DFN -15 dos e levels.  
8.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
Key pharmacokinetic endpoints will be C max, AUC 0-t and T max. Other pharmacokinetic 
parameters like AUC 0-0.25, AUC 0-0.5, AUC 0-0.75, AUC 0-1, AUC 0-2, AUC 0-3, AUC 0-4, 
AUC 0-6 will also be calculated. Any other additional parameters requiring estimation 
will be included in the PK Analysis Plan .

The safety endpoints will include the following:  
1) incidence of AE’s and SAEs  
2) incidence of abnormal clinical laboratory tests, including routine blood 
chemistry and hematology , coagulation parameters  and urinalysis  
3) incidence of clinically significant changes in vital signs  parameters  
4) incidence of clinically significant abnormal ECG findings  
8.3. General Considerations for Statis tical Analysis  
8.3.1.  Analysis Datasets  
Modified Intent -to-Treat ( mITT) Analysis Set: The mITT set will include all subjects 
who receive study drug, a nd have recorded at least one post dosing efficacy score .   
Safety Set:  The safety set will include all treated  subjects and will be used for safety and 
tolerability assessments.   
Pharmacokinetic Set:  The pharmacokinetic set will include all subjects who have 
received a  dose of  DFN -15 and have at least one quantifiable concentration of celecoxib 
in plasma.   
Non-compartmental analysis as specified in a PK Analysis Plan will be used to estimate 
pharmacokinetic parameters and to present  descriptive statistics  using the 
Pharmacokinetic Set . Additional exposure -response analysis may be built in the full 
statistical analysis plan ( SAP). Comparisons will be performed at the 0.05 two -sided 
significance level unless otherwise specified. No adjustments for multiplicity will be 
performed. Additional details of the anal ysis will be provided in the SAP and/or the 
clinical study report.  The SAP will supersede the protocol in case of a discrepancy.  
8.3.2.  Procedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise  no imputation will be done for missing data.  However, A Es 
with missing severity assessments will be tabulated as “severe,” and A Es with missing 
relationship assessments will be tabulated as “related” for the purpose of analysis; and 
the missing data will be presented in data listing as is.  
8.3.2.1.  PI and PR Score s Before and After Analgesic Rescue Medication  
All subjects are expected to assess their postoperative pain intensity and pain relief 
according to the pain intensity  and pain relief  schedule following the administration of 
study medication ; those PI  and PR  assessments are referenced as the scheduled P Is and 
PRs.  Subjects who require rescue analgesia are expected to report their pain intensity  
and pain relief  within 5 minutes  before ta king the rescue medication; these  PI and PR  are 
referenced as the pre -rescue PI  and PR .  When the assessment of a scheduled PI  and PR 
are done after the rescue medication the scheduled PI  and PR score s will b e replaced by 
the pre -rescue PI and PR score s for the purpose of efficacy analysis. This method is 
referenced as the Las t Observation Carried Forward ( LOCF).  The original scheduled PI  
and PR  scores will be displayed on data listing along with the ‘imputed’ PI and PR 
score s.

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 59 of 81 8.3.3.  Definitions for Assessment Windows  
For the purpose of data analysis,  baseline  measures for a given pe riod will be the last 
measurements taken before the subject receives the study medication.  
8.3.4.  Derived Variables  
Pain intensity score s (range from 0 to 10) should be recorded at pre -dose (Time 0; 
baseline) and at the defined post -dose intervals.  PI data with missing baseline PI score 
will be excluded from the analysis.   
8.3.5.1.  PID and SPID     
Pain intensity Difference at time t (PID t) = PI 0 – PIt, where t = 15, 30, and 45 minutes, 
then 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5,  6, 7 and 8  hours ; PI 0 is baseline PI score.  
Percent improvement in pain intensity at time t (% PID t) = 100*(PI 0 – PIt)/PI 0 
Time weighted SPID calculations will be computed by multiplying a weight factor to 
each pain score prior to summation.  The weight factor at each time poi nt is the time 
elapsed since the previous observation.  
8.3.4.1.   TOTPAR  
Time weighted TOTPAR  calculations will be computed by multiplying a weight factor 
to each PR prior to summation.  The weight factor at each time point is the time elapsed 
since the previous ob servation.  
8.4. Study Population Summaries  
Population summaries will be provided for the safety analysis set included in this study.  
8.4.1.  Disposition  
The summary tables will provide frequency counts for subject disposition (all treated 
subjects, subjects who comple ted the study, subjects who discontinued from the study, 
and reason for discontinuation) by treatment group and study overall.   
Disposition in terms of number of subjects excluded from each analysis sets ( mITT, 
safety and pharmacokinetic) will also be pro vided by treatment groups and study overall.  
8.4.2.  Demographics  
The demographic summary will include descriptive statistics for age, sex, race, weight, 
height, and BMI for the overall and by treatment group.  
8.4.3.  Protocol Violations  
All protocol violations and devia tions will be identified.  Tabulation may provide if data 
warrant.  
8.4.4.  Treatment Compliance  
Doses of study medication will be administered by the study subjects under observation 
of study personnel while confined to the study site.  The exact time of administration of 
study medication will be documented within each  subject’s CRF.  No formal summary 
of treatment compliance will be produced.

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 60 of 81 8.4.5.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prior and concomitant medications will be tabulated for the overall study po pulation.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded to the therapeutic drug classes and 
generic drug names using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug classifications 
version 1Q2013 or higher.  
8.5. Efficacy Analysis  
8.5.1.  SPID and PID Analyses  
Time weight ed SPID6 is the primary efficacy endpoint.  The difference among the 
treatment groups for the primary endpoint, as well as the secondary endpoints of SPID2, 
SPID4 and SPID8 will be evaluated using analysis of variance . Model will be an 
ANCOVA with treatment as main effect, and baseline PI as a covariate.  If multiple 
centers are enrolled, then center may be added as an exploratory factor and the 
interaction with treatment will be explored .  
A sensitivity analysis will be performed to examine the int eraction between the 
treatment and analysis center.  If the interaction is considered significant at 0.10 
significant level a subgroup analysis by analysis center will be performed to examine the 
treatment effect at each site in order to understand the nat ure of the interaction between 
the treatment and analysis center.   
Analgesic effect of DFN -15 at each dose level compared to placebo will be evaluated 
using Dunnett’s test.   
PID at each time point will be summarized with descriptive statistics (sample siz e, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for each treatment group; change 
from baseline within a group will be tested with 1 -sample t-test.  Group mean by time 
profile will be graphically presented for pain intensity measurements.   
8.5.2.  TOTPA R and Pain Relief Analyses  
The difference among the treatment groups for the secondary endpoints of TOTPAR2, 
TOTPAR4, TOTPAR6 and TOTPAR8 will be evaluated using analysis of variance with 
an analysis model and sensitivity analysis similar to that specified  for the primary 
endpoint.   
Analgesic effect of DFN -15 at each dose level compared to placebo will be evaluated 
using Dunnett’s test.  
PR at each time point will be summarized with descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minim um, and maximum) for each treatment group.  Group 
mean by time profile will be graphically presented for pain relief measurements.    
8.5.3.  Time to Event End Points  
There are 2 types of time to event endpoints in this study:  
1) Time to perceptible pain relief and ti me to meaningful pain relief as measured by 
two stopwatch technique post first dose of study drug  
2) Time to first dose of rescue medication post study drug  dose 
PROTOCOL DFN -15-CD-010

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 61 of 81 Time to event endpoints will be derived for each subject.  Subjects without the event 
will be cen sored at time of last evaluation.  Time to analgesic onset and time to rescue 
will be summarized graphically with Kaplan -Meier curves and compared across 
treatments using the log -rank test. Estimated percentiles for time to relief will be 
tabulated by trea tment group along with number and percent subjects censored for this 
analysis. If center effect is significant  based on the time weighted SPID6 , the log -rank 
test for time to pain relief will be stratified by analysis center.   
8.5.4.  Patient Rating of Treatment s atisfactoriness  
Number and percent of subjects in each satisfaction  category (0 -poor, 1 -fair, 2 -good, 3 -
very good, or 4 -excellent) will be tabulated by treatment group.  The difference between 
the groups in global pain control will be evaluated based on proportion of subjects rated 
their pain control as good, very good, o r excellent using Fisher’s exact test.   
8.5.5.  Proportion of Subjects Requiring Rescue Medication  
The analysis will evaluate the relative risk ( DFN -15 vs. Placeb o) of requiring rescue 
medication  during the study.  Proportion s of subjects who used rescue medication  at 
least once will be tabulated by treatment group; difference s between each DFN -15 dose 
group and placebo will be assessed using the relative risk approach.  Observed 
incidence, estimated relative risk ratio and corresponding 95% CI for the rel ative risk 
will be provided.   
The n umber of times rescue medication used during the in-patient 8 hour evaluation 
phase  will also be tabulated by  treatment group . Incidence of rescue medication use will 
be summarized and analyzed with a generalized linear model using a logit link.  
8.5.6.  Subgroup Analyses for Efficacy  
No subgroup analysis for efficacy endpoints is planned. Subgroup analyses may be 
performed as exploratory analyses if warranted.  
8.6. Safety and Tolerability Evaluations  
8.6.1.  Extent of Exposure  
All subjects wi ll be expected to receive a single dose  of study medication. No formal 
evaluation of the extent of exposure will be performed.  
8.6.2.  Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version  16 or higher) will be used to 
classify all A Es with resp ect to system organ class and preferred term.  
Four  types of summaries will be produced for the AE summary:  
1. an overall summary of A Es: number and percentage  of subjects with at least 
one event and number of events for each severity for all AEs, and SAEs  
2. a summary table of A Es and SAEs by system organ class and preferred term and 
severity  
3. a summary table of AEs and SAEs by system organ class and preferred term and 
causal relationship to the Investigational Drug

total incidence  
AEs will be tabulated by treatment group  and overall . AEs that lead to premature 
discontinuation from the study or to death will be listed separately via data listings.    
8.6.3.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory values collected at each time point will be summarized by treatment group 
without formal statistical te sting.  
8.6.4.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Resting vital sign values at each time point collected will be summarized by treatment 
without formal statistical testing . 
8.6.5.  Electrocardiograms  
The number and proportion of subjects with abnormal ECG findings at each time point  
collected will be tabulated by treatment group.  A data listing will be provided for 
subjects with changes from normal at baseline to abnormal and clinically significant 
after baseline by treatment.  
8.6.6.  Subgroup Analyses for Safety Endpoints

9.1. Regulatory and Ethical Consider ations  
9.1.1.  Regulatory Authority Approval  
The sponsor will obtain approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory 
agency in accordance with any applicable country specific regulatory requirements 
before any site may initiate the study in that coun try. 
9.1.2.  Ethical Conduct of the Study and Ethics Approval  
This study will be conducted according to GCP; US 21  Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part  50 (Protection of Human Subjects); US 21  CFR Part  56 (IRBs); US 21  CFR 
Part 54 (Financial Disclosure); Interna tional Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
Guidance for Industry, E6  GCP: Consolidated Guidance; the Nuremberg Code; and, 
where applicable the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Recommendations 
guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving  Human Subjects), and with 
the NH&MRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007).   
9.1.2.1.  Ethics Committees  
The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for ensuring that this 
protocol, the site’s informed consent form, and any other information that will be 
presented to potential subjects (e.g., advertisements or information that supports or 
supplements the informed consent form) are reviewed and approved by the appropriate 
IRB or IEC.  The investigator agrees to allow the I RB or IEC direct access to all relevant 
documents.  The IRB or IEC must be constituted in accordance with all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  The sponsor will provide the investigator with relevant 
documents or data needed for IRB or IEC review and ap proval of the study.  Before 
investigational products can be shipped to the site, the sponsor must receive copies of 
the IRB or IEC approval, the approved informed consent form, and any other 
information that the IRB or IEC has approved for presentation to  potential subjects.  
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other information that the IRB or IEC 
has approved for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the study, the 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where 
applicable, these amended documents.  The investigator must follow all applicable 
regulatory requirements pertaining to the use of an amended informed consent form, 
including obtaining IRB or IEC approval of the amended form, be fore new subjects 
consent to take part in the study using the new version of the form.  The investigator 
must promptly forward to the sponsor copies of the IRB or IEC approval of the amended 
informed consent form or other information and the approved amend ed informed 
consent form or other information.  IRB or IEC approval of the consent forms must be 
obtained in addition to the approval given for the clinical study.  Regulatory review and 
approval may be required in some countries before IRB or IEC approval  can be sought.  
9.1.2.2.  General Considerations

risks of their participation in the study, and they have a free  choice to participate 
or not.  
• The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in 
such a way as to ensure the integrity of the findings.  
• The potential benefits of the research justify the risks.  
Dr. Reddy’s  Laboratories Limited  is the sponsor of study DFN -15-CD-010.  The 
sponsor is responsible for all of the following:  
• selecting qualified investigators  
• providing investigators with the information they need to conduct the 
investigation properly  
• ensuring proper monitoring of the inv estigation  
• ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all participating investigators 
are properly informed of significant new information regarding AEs or risks 
associated with DFN -15. 
9.1.3.  Informed Consent  
The investigator will be provided with  a sample informed consent form for this study.  
Investigators are encouraged to use the sample form; however, they may adapt the 
information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the 
required elements of informed consent specified in  21 CFR Part 50.25).  The final 
informed consent form must be accepted by the sponsor and approved by the IRB or 
IEC.  Investigators must provide the sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final 
informed consent form before and after it is approved by the IR B or IEC.  If any new 
information becomes available that might affect subjects’ willingness to participate in 
the study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed consent 
form, the investigator will be provided  with a revised inf ormed consent form.  The IRB 
or IEC must provide written approval of any revisions to the informed consent form in 
advance of its use.  
Investigators must provide subjects with all the information necessary to make an 
informed decision about their participa tion in the study, including the nature and 
intended purpose of the study, possible benefits, and possible risks.  
All information in the informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether 
written or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical  and that is understandable to the 
subjects.  
Before written informed consent is obtained, the subject should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study.  All questions must be answered to 
the satisfaction of the subject ( or his or her legally authorized representative).  
Before a subject undergoes procedures specific to the protocol, the informed consent 
form must be signed and dated by the subject (or his or her legally authorized 
representative) and any other signatories as required by the IRB or IEC.

a) Assess updates since screening and evaluate for continued eligibility.  
b) Subject will be randomized if all I/E criteria are met, including post -operative inclusion criteria.  
c) Vitals include systolic and diastolic (seated) blood pressure, pulse rate and respir atory rate , seated or supine . To be completed prior to early withdrawal , prior to pain assessments, when applicable.  
d) Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed according to the schedule in Appendix C. Any of the above laboratory parame ters (or any a dditional laboratory parameter not part of the clinical lab 
evaluation) may be assessed unscheduled based on the discretion of the investigator during the study, and may be assessed dur ing the study after consultation with the study Medical Monitor, unless  
needed in emergency to ensure the safety of the subject; in such a case, Medical Monitor should be notified as soon as possib le. 
e) Day 7, End of study follow -up safety lab draws are to be performed only if there is a clinically significant abnormality or on going AE (s). 
f) Urine pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of child -bearing potential at Screening, Prior to Surgery and Randomization and at End of Study.  
g) Urine screen for common drugs of abuse and alcohol breathalyzer test will be perfor med for all subjects at screening, and prior to admission for surgery  (Check -in).   
h) For timepoints where ECG coincides with vital signs collection, ECG must be conducted first  or concurrently  with vital signs . Should pain assessments and PK / safety lab  samples also coincide, 
ECG and vitals must precede applicable pain assessments, then PK and safety lab draws are to follow pain assessments ; see item (l).  To be completed prior to early withdrawal, when applicable.  
i) Pre-dose assessments only; determines ra ndomization if “moderate” to “severe” baseline pain outcome (PI) and NPRS score ≥5.  
j) In addition to the stated assessment schedule, pain intensity will be assessed by the patient using the 11 -point NPRS immediately within ±5 minutes of provision of rescue medication.  Assessment will 
also be completed prior to early withdrawal.  
k) In addition to the stated pain relief assessment schedule, pain relief will be assessed by the patient using a 5 -point categorical  pain relief (PR)  scale immediately before provision of rescue medication. 
Assessment will also be completed prior to early withdrawal.  
l) Patient Rating of Treatment satisfactoriness’ assessment  will be completed at 8 hours after treatment initiation, or at time of first pro vision of rescue medication, whichever is earlier.  Assessment will 
also be completed prior to early withdrawal.  
m) Whenever the time of a PK blood sample collection coincides with efficacy assessments, the PK sample will be drawn after the efficacy assessment s are taken. Any PK sample within the first hour 
post-dose ( including the sample taken at 1 -hour post -dose) may be drawn ±5 minutes within the scheduled time. Any PK sample after the 1st hour post -dose may be drawn ±10 minutes within the 
scheduled time. Th e exact clock time of sample collection will be recorded and used in the PK analysis . To be completed prior to early withdrawal, after pain assessments, when applicable.

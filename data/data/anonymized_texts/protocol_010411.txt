CONFIDENTIAL 4  Summary of Changes 
It is anticipated that some subjects will be continuing to r eceive study treatment at the time of 
data cutoff for completion of analyses and preparation of the clinical study report (CSR).  A new section (Section 9.5) has been added to the protocol in this amendment to allow for these 
subjects to continue to receive study treatment and to be followed according to institutional standard of care for subsequent assessment of efficacy and safety. 
1) For subjects who are continuing to receive study treatment at the time of data cutoff, 
the Sponsor will continue to supply study drug (mogamulizumab and nivolumab) until the subject has completed the maximum treatment period of 96 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 (Section 6.3) or until the subject meets one of the criteria for removal 
from therapy as described in Section 7.5.   
2) For all ongoing subjects, i.e., subjects who are continuing to receive study treatment 
or who are in safety or survival follow-up at the time of data cutoff, the following changes in study procedures and data collection will be implemented: 
• Assessments of disease status and safety/tolerability, as well as decisions 
regarding continuation of study treatment, will be made according to institutional standard of care as determined by the Principal Investigator. 
• Central laboratory analysis of samples will no longer be required. 
• Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and anti-drug 
antibody (ADA) analyses will no longer be collected. 
• Survival follow-up will be discontinued for all subjects.  
• Electronic data capture will be terminated for all subjects and all data upon 
notification from the Sponsor. 
• For subjects who are continuing to receive study treatment at the time of 
implementation of this amendment, SAEs and treatment-related AEs will be reported to the KKD Drug Safety Surveillance Department using the SAE form. 
References to Section 9.5 have been added as relevant in other protocol sections. 
Additional changes to the protocol include an update of the Sponsor address and 
identification of a new Medical Monitor for the study.

Name of Active Ingredient: 
Mogamulizumab 
Nivolumab  
Study Title:  Open-label, Multicenter, Phase 1/2 Study of Mogamulizumab in Combination with Nivolumab in 
Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors  
Protocol Number:  0761-014  
Investigators and Study Center(s):  Up to 23 sites in the United States (US)  
Phase of Development:  1/2 
Objectives:  
Primary: To characterize the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose in the absence of exceeding the MTD, of the combination regimen of mogamulizumab 
and nivolumab in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. 
Secondary: 
• To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of mogamulizumab and nivolumab based on the 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v. 1.1). Anti-tumor activity will be assessed as overall response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). 
Exploratory: 
• To assess serum concentrations of mogamulizumab and nivolumab when administered in combination. 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of mogamulizumab and nivolumab when administered in combination. 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of the combination of mogamulizumab and nivolumab and 
determine which biomarkers may correlate with safety and/or anti-tumor activity. 
• To evaluate the ORR of the combination of mogamulizumab and nivolumab based on the immune-related 
RECIST (irRECIST) v 1.1.  
Study Design: 
This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-finding, cohort-expansion study of the anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab in combination therapy with the anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody nivolumab in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Subjects will be screened for entry into this 
study after signing the informed consent form (ICF). Subjects who meet study entry criteria will enter the 
treatment cohort that is open to enrollment. The study includes a Phase 1 dose finding and a Phase 2 cohort expansion: 
• Phase 1 dose finding has a 3+3 design that will identify the MTD or the highest protocol-defined dose, in 
the absence of exceeding the MTD, for the combination regimen and will enroll up to 12 subjects (3 to 6 subjects per cohort).  
• Phase 2 cohort expansion will explore the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), PD, and anti-tumor activity of the 
highest tolerated dose of the combination regimen and will enroll up to 184 subjects (21 to 36 per tumor type) in up to 7 tumor-specific expansion cohorts. 
All subjects will r eceive 240 mg of nivolumab as at least a 30-minute intravenous (iv) infusion on Days 1 and 
15 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects will then r eceive the cohort-assigned dose of mogamulizumab as at least a

Protocol Number:  0761-014  
1-hour iv infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the first cycle and on Days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. When 
both nivolumab and mogamulizumab are administered at the same visit, the infusion of mogamulizumab will be 
started at least 30 minutes after the end of the infusion of nivolumab. Subjects should be closely monitored for adverse events (AEs) for at least: 
• 30 minutes after the completion of the nivolumab infusion; 
• 4 hours after the completion of the mogamulizumab infusion for the first 2 combination infusions (i.e., 
Cycle 1, Days 1 and 15); and  
• 30 minutes after all other mogamulizumab infusions. 
Subjects will be monitored for safety throughout the study. Tumor assessments will be performed during the 
Screening period, at Week 10, then at least every 12 weeks thereafter until unequivocal disease progression or 
death. Tumor biopsies will be required during the Screening period (except for the subjects who present archival 
tumor tissues) and at Week 10 (unless the tumor is inaccessible for biopsy). Pharmacokinetic and PD parameters 
and immunogenicity will be determined for mogamulizumab and nivolumab.  
The first post-treatment follow-up visit will be 30 days (± 5 days) after the last dose of investigational medicinal 
product(s) (IMP[s]). The second follow-up visit will be 100-110 days after the last dose of IMP. Adverse events and SAEs with onset up to 100 days after the last dose of IMP should be reported, as should any SAEs that 
occur after that time and are considered potentially related to IMPs or study procedures. Subjects will be 
contacted at least every 100 days after the last dose for survival follow up and recording of new anti-cancer therapies. All new treatments for cancer should be recorded, including nivolumab if received after discontinuation from this study. Subjects who complete or discontinue treatment without progression will have tumor assessments collected until a new anti-cancer therapy is started, unequivocal disease progression is documented, or death. 
Procedures to be followed for subjects who are ongoing in the study (i.e., subjects who are continuing to receive 
study treatment or who are in safety or survival follow-up) at the time of data cutoff for completion of analyses and preparation of the clinical study report (CSR) are described in Section 9.5.

Dose-finding Criteria: 
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) composed of physician(s) from the Sponsor and/or designee and 
Investigators will review cumulative safety data from all subjects before deciding whether to change the dose level or open the expansion cohorts. Dose finding will continue until an MTD has been established or it is determined that the expansion cohorts should open or that dosing should stop. Further exploration of intermediate doses may take place based on evaluation of emerging safety and PK/PD parameters in the current trial as well as other ongoing trials. 
Definition of Dose-limiting Toxicity: 
A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the occurrence of any of the following toxicities that are considered 
related to IMP , with onset from the first dose to 14 days after the last dose of IMP in Cycle 1: 
Hematologic Toxicity: 
1) Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; 
2) Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; 
3) Febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3 with a single temperature of > 38.3°C 
[101°F]; 
4) Grade 4 neutropenia of duration > 7 days; 
Note: Grade ≥ 3 lymphopenia or leukopenia of any duration is not considered a DLT. 
Non-hematologic Toxicity: 
5) Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation > 5 to ≤ 10 times the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) (Grade 3) that does not downgrade to ≤ Grade 1 (or to baseline grade if  > Grade 
1 at baseline)within 14 days; 
6) AST or ALT elevation > 10 times ULN; 
7) Total bilirubin > 5 times ULN; 
8) ALT or AST elevation > 3 times ULN AND concomitant total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial

tumor 
progression,  viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other 
drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic; 
9) A ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic laboratory AE (other than AST, ALT, or bilirubin) is a DLT only if it 
requires medical intervention or hospitalization. Exception: Grade 3 or Grade 4 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs or symptoms, and either resolve spontaneously or respond to conventional medical intervention are not DLTs;

(As of Amendment 3, re-treatment of subjects who stop 
treatment without disease progression will no longer be allowed.) 
Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic, and Safety Variables: 
Efficacy:  Anti-tumor activity will be evaluated using both RECIST v. 1.1 and irRECIST v. 1.1. Anti-tumor 
activity will be assessed as BOR, TTR, DOR, PFS, and OS. 
Pharmacokinetic: The following PK parameters will be measured: 
• Mogamulizumab : observed minimum serum concentration at the end of a dosing interval (C min) and 
observed maximum serum concentration (C max); 
• Nivolumab: C min  
Pharmacodynamic: The biomarkers may include, but are not limited to, immune cell subsets and immune 
factors such as cytokines and chemokines in tumor and/or blood.  
Immunogenicity: Anti-mogamulizumab antibody and anti-nivolumab antibody. 
Safety:  Adverse events; clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, thyroid function testing, hematology, 
coagulation profile, urinalysis); immunogenicity; vital signs; 12-lead ECGs; physical examination (including body weight, etc.) will be evaluated to determine the safety profile in this combination regimen. 
Statistical Methods and Planned Analysis: 
Evaluation of the data for this study will consist primarily of data listings and summary displays. Demographic

and other baseline characteristic information will be summarized for the Safety Analysis and Efficacy Analysis 
Sets. Adverse events will be tabulated by body system, severity, and relation to treatment. Similar presentations will be provided for SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of IMP and AEs leading to death. The tabulation of laboratory parameters will indicate the normal range for each parameter. Each value will be classified as falling above, below, or within the normal range.  
Individual serum concentrations at each sampling time point for mogamulizumab and nivolumab will be 
presented in listings. Descriptive summary statistics of serum concentrations including means, geometric means, ranges, standard deviations, and coefficient of variation will be presented by dose cohort and by tumor type. Dose proportionality will be assessed as appropriate. Population PK analysis will be explored, if appropriate. 
Pharmacodynamic data will be summarized. Changes from baseline in PD parameters may be used as PD 
markers to explore PK/PD, PD-efficacy, and PD-safety relationships, as appropriate. 
The number and percentage of subjects with a positive anti-drug antibody ( ADA) test in the screening, 
confirmatory, or neutralizing assays, if applicable, will be presented at each visit and overall for subjects exposed to mogamulizumab and nivolumab. Additionally, a summary of subjects who experienced an infusion related reaction and had a positive ADA test in the screening, confirmatory, and neutralizing assays, if 
applicable, will be presented. All immunogenicity data will be listed by subject. Immunogenicity may be reported for ADA positive status (such as persistent pos itive, neutralizing positive, only last sample positive, 
baseline positive and other positive) and ADA negative status, relative to baseline. Effect of immunogenicity on safety, efficacy, biomarkers and PK may be explored. 
Subjects will be evaluated for tumor response, TTR, DOR, and PFS. The ORR w ill be calculated as the 
proportion of subjects who are responders, i.e., complete response (CR) and partial response (PR); the 95% exact confidence interval for ORR will be calculated. The ORR will be derived using both the RECIST v. 1.1 
and the irRECIST v. 1.1, based on the efficacy-evaluable subjects in the expansion cohorts for combination 
therapy, which includes all subjects who receive combination therapy in Cycle 1 Day 1. Duration of response, OS, and PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology.

CONFIDENTIAL 41  5 OBJECTIVES 
5.1 Primary 
To characterize the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 
or the highest protocol-defined dose in the absence of exceeding the MTD, of the 
combination regimen of mogamulizumab and nivolumab in subjects with locally advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors. 
5.2 Secondary 
1) To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of mogamulizumab and 
nivolumab based on the RECIST v. 1.1. Anti-tumor activity will be assessed as ORR, time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), PFS, and OS. 
5.3 Exploratory 
1) To assess serum concentrations of mogamulizumab and nivolumab when 
administered in combination. 
2) To evaluate the immunogenicity of mogamulizumab and nivolumab when 
administered in combination. 
3) To evaluate the PD profile of the combination of mogamulizumab and nivolumab and 
determine which biomarkers may correlate with safety and/or anti-tumor activity. 
4) To evaluate the ORR of the combination of mogamulizumab and nivolumab based on 
the irRECIST v. 1.1. 
6 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION 
6.1 Study Overview 
This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-finding and cohort-expansion study of the 
anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab in combination therapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody 
nivolumab in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Subjects will be 
screened for entry into this study after signing the informed consent form (ICF). Subjects who meet study entry criteria will enter the treatment cohort that is open to enrollment.  
The study includes a Phase 1 dose finding and a Phase 2 cohort-expansion:  • Phase 1 dose-finding has a 3+3 design that will identify the MTD, or the highest 
protocol-defined dose in the absence of exceeding the MTD, for the combination regimen and will enroll up to 12 subjects (3 to 6 subjects per cohort).  
• Phase 2 cohort-expansion will explore the safety, PK, PD, and anti-tumor activity of the 
highest tolerated dose of the combination regimen and will enroll up to 184 subjects (21 to 36 per cohort) in up to 7 tumor-specific expansion cohorts. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 42  6.1.1 Phase 1: Dose Finding  
A starting dose level and an optional dose level are planned. The dose-finding phase will 
enroll up to 12 subjects (3 to 6 subjects per cohort). The dose levels and schedules are 
described in Table 6.1.1-1. 
The MTD is defined as one dose level below the dose level of the cohort where ≥ one-third of 
the subjects experience DLT. The recommended dose regimen for Phase 2 is intended to be either the MTD or the highest dose level tested.

(Days 1, 15) 
   
    
a: This dose level may be enrolled if > 1 subject experiences DLT at Dose Level 1. 
DLT=dose limiting toxicity.  
A minimum of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated in each cohort, and all 3 subjects will 
be observed for the DLT observation period (see Section 6.1.2.1). Subjects who are not evaluable for DLT will be replaced. All cohorts will have a minimum of 3 DLT-evaluable subjects. Cycle 1 Day 1 dosing of subjects in each cohort should be separated by at least 1 day during Phase 1 of the study. 
6.1.2 Dose-finding Criteria 
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) composed of physicians from the Sponsor and/or 
designee and Investigators will review cumulative safety data from all subjects before deciding whether to change the dose level or open the expansion cohorts.  
The first meeting of the SRC will occur before the study opens to enrollment. At that meeting 
the SRC will discuss the role and responsibilities of the SRC and review the safety data from the ongoing 0761-013 Phase 1 study. In that study, nivolumab is administered at 3.0 mg/kg and mogamulizumab has been administered at 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. The SRC may decide to open Phase 1 of this study at the optional dose level if there is concern about the safety of the combination at the higher dose level in the Japanese trial.   
Dose finding will continue until an MTD has been established or it is determined that the 
expansion cohorts should open or that dosing should stop. Further exploration of intermediate 
doses may take place based on evaluation of emerging safety and PK/PD parameters in the 

Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3

6.1.2.1 Definition of Dose-limiting Toxicity  
A DLT is defined as the occurrence of any of the following toxicities that are considered 
related to IMP , with onset from the first dose to 14 days after the last dose of IMP in 
Cycle 1:  
Hematologic Toxicity 
1) Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; 
2) Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; 
3) Febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3 with a single temperature 
of > 38.3°C [101°F]); 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 44  4) Grade 4 neutropenia of duration > 7 days; 
Note: Grade > 3 lymphopenia or leukopenia of any duration is not considered a DLT. 
Non-hematologic Toxicity 
5) Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation > 5 to 
≤ 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grade 3) that does not downgrade to 
≤ Grade 1 (or to baseline grade if  > Grade 1 at baseline) within 14 days; 
6) AST or ALT elevation > 10 times ULN; 
7) Total bilirubin > 5 times ULN; 
8) ALT or AST elevation > 3 times ULN AND concomitant total bilirubin > 2 times 
ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase), 
AND no other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT/AST elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, tumor progression, viral hepatitis, 
pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic; 
9) A ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic laboratory AE (other than AST, ALT, or bilirubin) is a 
DLT only if it requires medical intervention or hospitalization. Exception: Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs or 
symptoms, and either resolve spontaneously or respond to conventional medical intervention are not DLTs; 
Note: ≥ Grade 3 elevation of amylase and/or lipase of any duration not associated 
with clinical or radiographic evidence of pancreatitis is not a DLT; 
10) Grade 4 non-hematologic non-laboratory AE; 
11) Grade 3 skin rash that does not improve to ≤ Grade 2 within 3 days of initiation of 
maximal supportive care; 
12) Grade 3 uveitis, bronchospasm, or neurologic toxicity of any duration; 
13) Any other Grade 3 non-hematologic non-laboratory AE lasting > 7 days, with the 
following exceptions: 
a) Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (e.g., 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, tumor lysis 
syndrome) is not a DLT; 
b) Grade 3 fatigue is not a DLT; 
c) Grade 3 fever not associated with hemodynamic compromise is not a DLT; 
14) Grade 2 or higher pneumonitis of any duration; 
15) Any Grade 2 uveitis, eye pain, or blurred vision that does not respond to topical 
therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 within 14 days OR requires systemic 
treatment. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 45  6.1.2.2 Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose 
The MTD is defined as one dose level below the dose level of the cohort where ≥ one-third of 
the subjects experience DLT. 
6.1.3 Phase 2: Expansion Cohort  
To further characterize the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of the combination, up 
to 184 subjects (21 to 36 subjects per tumor type) with locally advanced or metastatic disease in the following tumor types will be enrolled: squamous cell NSCLC; PD-L1-non-expressing non-squamous cell NSCLC; SCCHN; colorectal carcinoma, non-microsatellite instability (non-MSI) high; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and ovarian cancer (including primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube carcinoma). Subjects will be treated with the highest dose of the combination regimen that was considered tolerable in 
Phase 1.  
The SRC will review cumulative safety data from all subjects approximately every 2 months 
during the enrollment period. Clinical safety in the expansion cohorts will be monitored continually. If the rate of AEs meeting DLT definitions during the expansion portion of the study is > 1/3 in at least 3 evaluable subjects within a cohort, these findings will be discussed by the SRC, in the context of all available safety information, to determine whether enrollment to that cohort and/or the remaining cohorts should be suspended, whether a lower 
dose should be examined, or whether any additional monitoring or treatment requirements 
should be implemented. 
6.2 Number of Subjects, and Numbers and Location of Investigative Sites 
Up to 188 subjects at up to 23 sites in the US will be enrolled in this clinical trial. Of these, 
4 subjects were enrolled in Phase 1 (dose-finding) and up to 184 subjects will be enrolled in 
Phase 2 (cohort-expansion). The actual size of the study will depend on the DLTs observed 
and the resultant number and sizes of the cohorts in Phase 1 of the trial. 
6.3 Study Duration  
The study is composed of up to a 28-day Screening Period followed by a treatment period of 
up to 96 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1. Subjects who stop treatment without disease progression 
and who experience disease progression within 12 months of their last dose of IMP may 
receive additional cycles, as described in Section 8.1.6 . (NOTE: Upon implementation of 
Amendment 3, subjects who discontinued IMP without disease progression will not be allowed to receive additional IMP upon disease progression.)  Subjects who discontinue IMP 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 46  will enter a follow-up period and will be followed for survival. (Upon implementation of 
Amendment 3, survival follow-up will be discontinued for all subjects as described in Section 9.5.)

7.5 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment A subject is free to withdraw his/her consent and discontinue study treatment or participation 
in the study at any time for any reason. A subject may also be discontinued from the treatment, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or sponsor, for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of consent from further treatment with IMP; 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 54  • Withdrawal of consent from the study; 
• AEs (see Section 10.3); 
• Required use of prohibited concomitant medications; 
• Non-compliance that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, warrants withdrawal 
(e.g., refusal to adhere to scheduled visits); 
• Major protocol violation; 
• It is not considered in the best interest of the subject to continue; 
• Pregnancy; 
• Subjects who have unequivocal documented disease progression or symptomatic disease 
progression and are not eligible for continued treatment (see Section 8.1.5 ); 
• Lost to follow-up; 
• Administrative reasons (e.g., termination of the study). 
The Investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who discontinue from the study prior 
to completion; the reason(s) for study discontinuation will be documented. In the event that a 
subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to obtain and record the reason(s) for withdrawal, if possible, although the subject is not obligated to provide such a reason.  
If treatment is discontinued, both IMPs will be discontinued  (e.g., subjects will not be 
allowed to continue one investigational agent if the other is discontinued). For any case of treatment discontinuation (whether or not the subject is at the clinical site), the Investigator 
should ask the subject to complete the End-of-Treatment (EOT) and Follow-up visit 
procedures, provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent for those procedures (see Table 9-1  and Table 9-2  for the Schedule of Assessments). Subjects withdrawn from study 
without unequivocal disease progression or withdrawal of consent for follow up should continue tumor assessments until a new anticancer therapy is started, unequivocal disease progression is documented, withdrawal of consent for the follow-up contacts, or death.  
If a subject refuses to complete EOT procedures and/or the Follow-up visit, this refusal will 
be recorded. Subjects will be considered lost to follow-up only if no contact has been 
established by the time the study is completed such that there is insufficient information to 
determine the subject’s status at that time. Subjects who refuse continuing participation in the study, including telephone contacts, should be documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to follow-up.” Investigators should document attempts to re-establish contact with unresponsive subjects throughout the study period. If contact with a missing subject is re-established, the subject should not be considered lost to follow-up and any evaluations should resume according to the protocol. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 55  Procedures to be followed for subjects who are ongoing in the study (i.e., subjects who are 
continuing to receive study treatment or who are in safety or survival follow-up) at the time of data cutoff for completion of analyses are described in Section 9.5.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time. 
7.5.1 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects in Phase 1 will be considered nonevaluable for DLT and will be replaced if they do 
not experience a DLT and:  
• they do not receive all infusions of both IMPs in Cycle 1 within 28 days at the doses 
assigned to the cohort in which they are enrolled, or 
• they do not complete the safety follow-up through the end of the DLT evaluation period 
(Section 6.1.2.1 ).  
Subjects enrolled in Phase 2 may be replaced, for these same reasons, at the discretion of the 
Sponsor.

Treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis. Each dose of IMP will be prepared by 
the pharmacy (refer to the Pharmacy Manual for full preparation, administration, and storage requirements). Mogamulizumab dosing calculations should be based on the body weight assessed at Cycle 1 Day 1 (baseline). Mogamulizumab dose adjustments for each cycle are required for greater than a 10% change in body weight.  
All subjects will receive 240 mg of nivolumab as at least a 30-minute iv infusion on Days 1 
and 15 of each 28-day cycle. When both nivolumab and mogamulizumab are administered at the same visit, the infusion of mogamulizumab will be started at least 30 minutes after the 
end of infusion of nivolumab.  
• Nivolumab injection is to be administered as an iv infusion through a 0.2-micron to 
1.2-micron pore size, low-protein binding polyethersulfone membrane in-line filter 
• Subjects may be dosed no less than 12 days from the previous dose of nivolumab.  
• There are no premedications recommended for nivolumab prior to the first infusion. 

Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 57  • Subjects should be carefully monitored for infusion-related reactions during IMP 
administration. If an acute infusion-related reaction is noted, subjects should be managed 
according to Section 8.2.2 . 
Subjects will then receive the cohort-assigned dose of mogamulizumab as at least a 1-hour iv 
infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the first cycle and on Days 1 and 15 of subsequent 
cycles.  
• Mogamulizumab injection dose is to be administered as an iv infusion through a 0.22- or 
0.2-μm in-line filter.   
• Subjects may be dosed no less than 5 days from the previous dose of mogamulizumab.  
• Premedication with acetaminophen orally and diphenhydramine 50 mg iv (or equivalent) 
is recommended before the first mogamulizumab infusion (see Section 8.2.1 ).  
• Subjects should be carefully monitored for infusion-related reactions during IMP 
administration. If an acute infusion-related reaction is noted, subjects should be managed 
according to Section 8.2.2 . 
Subjects should be closely monitored for AEs for at least: 
• 30 minutes after the completion of the nivolumab infusion; 
• 4 hours after the completion of the mogamulizumab infusion for the first 2 combination 
infusions (i.e., Cycle 1, Days 1 and 15); and  
• 30 minutes after all other mogamulizumab infusions. 
8.1.2 Dose Reduction and Dose Delay Doses of IMPs may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the 
subject tolerates the treatment.  
8.1.2.1 Dose Reduction 
There will be no intra-patient dose reduction of either IMP by the Investigator. Doses within 
an assigned cohort may only be changed at the discretion of the SRC. (As of Amendment 3, the SRC will be disbanded.) 
8.1.2.2 Dose-delay Criteria 
IMP administration should be delayed for the following: 
• Any Grade 2 or 3 IMP-related AE, with the following exceptions: 
– Grade 2 IMP-related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities do not require a treatment 
delay. 
• Any Grade 3 IMP-related laboratory abnormality, with the following exceptions for 
lymphopenia or leukopenia, AST, ALT or total bilirubin or asymptomatic amylase or lipase: 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 58  – Lymphopenia or leukopenia of any grade does not require dose delay. 
– If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT or total bilirubin that is within normal limits, 
delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 2 toxicity. 
– If a subject has baseline AST, ALT or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity 
range, delay dosing for IMP-related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity. 
– If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 2 toxicity 
range, delay dosing for IMP-related toxicity that increase by 2-fold or values 
> 8 × ULN. 
– Any Grade ≥ 3 IMP-related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require dose delay. The 
Medical Monitor should be consulted for such Grade ≥ 3 amylase or lipase 
abnormalities. (As of Amendment 3, decisions regarding subject treatment should be 
made according to site standard of care as determined by the Principal Investigator.) 
– Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. 
Subjects who require delay of IMP should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently if 
clinically indicated and resume IMP dosing when re-dosing criteria are met. 
8.1.3 Criteria to Resume Dosing 
Subjects may resume treatment with IMP when the drug-related AE(s) resolve(s) to 
Grade ≤ 1 or baseline, with the following exceptions: 
• Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue. 
• Subjects who have experienced Grade 3 drug-related skin AE must have improvement to 
Grade ≤ 2 within 3 days. Treatment may resume once the AE has improved to Grade ≤ 1. 
• Subjects who have experienced a Grade 2 drug-related skin AE may resume treatment 
when it has resolved to Grade ≤ 1.  
• Subjects with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for 
reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT OR total bilirubin. 
– Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters should have treatment permanently discontinued. 
• Drug-related pulmonary toxicity must have resolved to baseline before treatment is 
resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis (asymptomatic; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated) after completion of a steroid 
taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with the Medical 
Monitor.  (As of Amendment 3, decisions regarding subject treatment should be made according to site standard of care as determined by the Principal Investigator.) 
• Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 59  Dose delay of IMP for drug-related toxicity which results in treatment interruption of 
> 6 weeks requires treatment discontinuation, with the following exception: 
• Dosing delays of > 6 weeks for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug-related AEs are 
allowed. Re-initiation of treatment in a subject with a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks from 
the previous dose requires consultation with the Medical Monitor. (As of Amendment 3, 
decisions regarding subject treatment should be made according to site standard of care as 
determined by the Principal Investigator.)  Required protocol assessments should 
continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety 
and laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more frequently, if clinically 
indicated, during such dosing delays. 
8.1.4 Criteria for Treatment Discontinuation for Toxicity IMP treatment should be permanently discontinued if one or more of the following drug-
related adverse events occurs: 
• Any AE occurring at any time during treatment that is related to IMP and that meets the 
DLT criteria listed in Section 6.1.2.1 , with the following exceptions: 
– Grade 2 pneumonitis which was treated and resolved according to the management 
guidelines in Section 8.2.3 . 
– Grade 3 or 4 drug-related endocrinopathy AEs, such as adrenal insufficiency, 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or 
glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic 
hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose-controlling 
agents, respectively, may not require discontinuation after discussion with the 
Medical Monitor.  (As of Amendment 3, decisions regarding subject treatment should 
be made according to site standard of care as determined by the Principal 
Investigator.) 
• Grade ≥ 3 hypersensitivity reaction or infusion-related reaction  
• Any drug-related event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 6 weeks from the previous 
dose requires discontinuation with the following exception:  
– Dosing delays of > 6 weeks for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug-related AEs 
are allowed.  
– Re-initiation of treatment in a subject with a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks from the 
previous dose requires consultation with the Medical Monitor. (As of Amendment 3, 
decisions regarding subject treatment should be made according to site standard of 
care as determined by the Principal Investigator.)  Required protocol assessments 
should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to 
assess safety and laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more 
frequently, if clinically indicated, during such dosing delays. 
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued IMP dosing. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 60  8.1.5 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression 
The IMPs used in this trial are meant to induce an immune response against the subject’s 
tumor and may not have an immediate effect on the tumor. In addition, the expected 
mechanism of action involves an infiltration of T-cells and inflammatory cells and local release of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore it is expected that initial radiographic progression may not be indicative of subsequent lack of response. Treatment may continue in spite of early radiographic progression, including appearance of new lesions, in the absence of symptomatic progression as long as the subject meets the other criteria in Sections 8.1.2  
and 8.1.3  and has not had an AE that meets the criteria for treatment discontinuation in 
Section 8.1.4 . Treatment past initial RECIST-defined radiographic progression may continue 
according to Investigator judgment, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, based on the 
subject’s overall clinical status, overall tumor burden, and rate of progression, taking into account the subject’s other treatment options and need for urgent intervention. (As of Amendment 3, decisions regarding subject treatment should be made according to site standard of care as determined by the Principal Investigator.)  For example, a subject may continue treatment if a tumor assessment shows improvement or stable disease compared to the previous scan, even if there is progression compared to the baseline scan. Investigators 
may schedule an additional tumor assessment within 6 weeks after a scan showing 
progression, in order to reassess the subject’s response.   
Subjects may be treated after progression if they meet these criteria: 
• Investigator-assessed potential clinical benefit; 
• No disease-related clinical deterioration; 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention; 
• Subject meets other re-dosing criteria in Section 8.1.3  and has not had an AE that meets 
the criteria for treatment discontinuation in Section 8.1.4 . 
If treatment is continued in spite of radiographic progression, the Investigator should record 
the rationale, and the subject must be informed that treatment beyond initial progression is 
not standard of care, and the Investigator should discuss potential risks and alternative treatment options. The sponsor will provide a consent form for re-consent of the subject prior to continuation of dosing, subject to institutional review board (IRB) approval. 
Subjects should permanently discontinue study therapy upon evidence of further progression, 
defined as an additional 20% or greater increase in total measured tumor burden (TMTB) from time of initial progression. Total measured tumor burden should be determined as described in Section 9.2.6 . The total measured tumor burden from time of initial progression 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 61  should be used as the reference baseline for comparison with the post-progression 
assessment.   
8.1.6 Re-treatment for Progression during Follow-up 
Subjects who stop IMP without disease progression and who experience disease progression 
within 12 months of their last dose of IMP may receive additional IMP for up to 48 weeks provided that they meet the criteria in Sections 8.1.2 , 8.1.3  and 8.1.4  and have not received 
other systemic therapy for their cancer. Biopsy of a progressing lesion should be obtained, if feasible. The Medical Monitor must be consulted before a subject in follow-up begins re-treatment. Subject must be re-consented prior to restarting IMP. (Upon implementation of Amendment 3, subjects who discontinued IMP without disease progression will not be 
allowed to receive additional IMP upon disease progression.) 
The schedule of assessments for Cycle ≥ 3 should be followed, except that PK, PD, and 
anti-drug antibody (ADA) assessments are not required. 
8.2 Management of Infusion-related Reaction and Other Toxicity 
8.2.1 Premedication 
It is recommended that subjects be premedicated with acetaminophen orally and 
diphenhydramine 50 mg iv (or equivalent), before the first mogamulizumab infusion. If a 
subject experiences an infusion-related reaction at any time during the study, pre-medication 
is recommended prior to subsequent infusions (see Section 8.2.2 ). 
No premedications are recommended for nivolumab prior to first infusion. If a subject 
experiences an infusion-related reaction at any time during the study, pre-medication is 
recommended prior to subsequent infusions (see Section 8.2.2 ). 
8.2.2 Treatment of Infusion-related Reactions 
As with any antibody, infusion-related reactions are possible. Appropriate drugs and medical 
equipment to treat allergic or anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study 
personnel must be trained to recognize and treat infusion-related reactions. If a subject experiences an infusion-related reaction at any time during the study, premedication with the following medications is recommended prior to subsequent infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before additional IMP administration. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 62  All Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reaction sh ould be reported within 24 hours to the 
Sponsor (see Section 10.3.3.3 ). 
Treatment recommendations for infusion-related reactions are provided in Table 8.2.2-1  and 
may be modified based on local treatment standards or guidelines, as appropriate. If a subject has an infusion-related reaction, blood samples should be drawn for assessment of cytokines 
(Table 10.2-1 ). 
Cytokine-release syndrome is not expected with mogamulizumab or nivolumab, but if 
cytokine-release syndrome is suspected, consider use of cytokine antagonists such as tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist). 
Table 8.2.2-1 Recommended Management  of Infusion-related Reaction 
Grade Symptoms Recommended Management 
1/2 • Mild or Moderate  (e.g., rash, flushing, 
urticaria, dyspnea, fever, pruritus/ 
itching, rigors/chills, sweating 
[diaphoresis], tachycardia) 
• Moderate reactions may require therapy 
but respond promptly to symptomatic 
treatment (e.g., antihistamines, NSAIDS, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, 
bronchodilators, iv fluids) •The infusion rate of the IMP(s) should be 
temporarily interrupted until resolution of the event. 
• Acetaminophen, NSAIDS, antihistamines, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and iv 
fluids may be administered at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
• The infusion should not be restarted until symptoms 
have subsided to Grade 1 or less.  
• The infusion may be re-started at half-rate when 
symptoms resolve. If no further complications 
ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased 
full rate. If symptoms recur, then no further IMP 
should be administered at that visit.  
• Pre-medication prior to subsequent doses are 
recommended 
3/4 • Severe/Life-threatenin g: Prolonged 
(i.e., not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief 
interruption of infusion); recurrence of 
symptoms following initial 
improvement; hospitalization indicated

CONFIDENTIAL 63  8.2.3 Immune-associated Select Adverse Events of Interest 
Immuno-oncology agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and mogamulizumab are 
considered immuno-oncology agents in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with immuno-oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity.  
Management algorithms have been developed to assist Investigators in assessing and 
managing the following groups of AEs and are included in the nivolumab IB: 
• Gastrointestinal 
• Renal 
• Pulmonary 
• Hepatic 
• Endocrinopathies 
• Skin 
• Neurological 
Recommended guidelines for managing hepatic events in subjects with elevated baseline 
LFTs are provided in Section 8.2.3.1 . 
For treatment of skin toxicity, recommended treatment guidelines are provided in Table 
8.2.3-1 .

8.2.3.1 Recommended Management of Hepatic Events in Subjects with HCC  
Subjects with advanced HCC generally have underlying cirrhosis with decreased hepatic 
function. They may also have a concomitant chronic viral infection. For the HCC cohort of this study, the upper limits for inclusion account for baseline liver dysfunction and allow enrollment of subjects with AST or ALT elevations within the CTCAE Grade 2 range. For these subjects, the following guidelines are provided: 
• Dose delay criteria for hepatic events are outlined in Section 8.1.2.2. If AST or ALT 
levels do not improve with a dose delay of 3 - 5 days or if the levels worsen, initiate 
steroid therapy at 0.5 - 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or oral equivalent. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 65  • For ALT or AST levels > 8 × ULN, initiate steroid therapy promptly at 1 - 2 
mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or oral equivalent. 
• For all subjects initiating steroids, consult the Medical Monitor within 24 hours after 
initiation of steroids. Gastroenterology consult is recommended. If AST or ALT 
levels do not improve within 3 - 5 days or the levels worsen after the start of steroid 
therapy, discuss with the Medical Monitor the possibility of adding mycophenolate 
mofetil at 1 g BID. (As of Amendment 3, decisions regarding subject treatment 
should be made according to site standard of care as determined by the Principal Investigator.) 
• Tapering of steroids can start once AST or ALT levels have declined by 1 CTCAE 
grade. Taper steroids slowly over no less than 1 month. 
• IMP may resume when AST or ALT have returned to near baseline unless the criteria 
for permanent discontinuation are reached (Sections 4.1.19 and 4.2). The Medical 
Monitor must be consulted prior to resuming IMP for all subjects who required 
steroid intervention. (As of Amendment 3, decisions regarding subject treatment 
should be made according to site standard of care as determined by the Principal 
Investigator.) 
• Discontinue IMP for any drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets 
the following criteria: 
– AST or ALT > 10 × ULN for > 2 weeks, 
– AST or ALT > 15 × ULN irrespective of duration, 
– T. bilirubin > 8 × ULN irrespective of duration for subjects with elevated bilirubin 
at study entry or > 5 × ULN for those with normal T bilirubin at entry, 
– Concurrent AST or ALT > 3 × ULN and T. bilirubin > 5 × ULN for subjects 
entering treatment with a normal bilirubin and up to 8 × ULN for subjects entering 
treatment with elevated bilirubin. 
8.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups In Phase 1, subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the dose level that is 
open to enrollment by the IRT system. In Phase 2, subjects will be enrolled into the cohort by tumor type by the IRT system.  
8.4 Blinding/Unblinding 
This study is not blinded. 
8.5 Concomitant Treatments 
Any medication(s), including those taken within 30 days prior to the first dose of IMPs, 
throughout treatment with IMP, until the 30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of IMP or 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 66  until start of new anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first), and anytime thereafter if used 
to treat IMP-related SAEs will be recorded.  
8.5.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications 
Subjects may receive medications to treat pre-existing conditions, IMP-related AEs, or 
IMP-unrelated AEs.  
Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroids are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted. 
Immunosuppressive agents including steroids may be used to treat IMP-related AEs, as 
described in Section 8.2. 
Concomitant palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms (including 
bisphosphonates and RANK-L inhibitors) is allowed if initiated prior to the first dose of study therapy.  
The potential for overlapping toxicities with radiotherapy and the IMPs currently is not 
known. Therefore, palliative radiotherapy is not recommended while receiving IMPs. If 
palliative radiotherapy is required, then IMP should be withheld for at least 1 week before, 
during and 1 week after radiation. Subjects should be closely monitored for any potential toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy, and AEs considered related to radiotherapy should resolve to Grade ≤ 1 prior to resuming IMP. Only non-target bone lesions without 
lung tissue included in the planned radiation field or CNS lesions may receive palliative radiotherapy while on study treatment.  
8.5.2 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments 
While on study, subjects are not permitted to receive any additional experimental therapy or 
any therapy to treat the disease under study other than the IMP. Supportive therapy to manage symptoms or AEs is acceptable as noted in Section 8.5.1 . 
The following medications are prohibited during the study unless utilized to treat an AE: 
• Immunosuppressive agents; 
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids, except as stated in Section 8.5.1 ; 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 67  • Any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, 
immunotherapy, extensive, non-palliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigational 
agents for treatment of cancer). 
Live-attenuated vaccines should not be administered during the treatment period and for at 
least 3 months after the last dose of IMP unless, according to the judgment of the Investigator 
in consultation with the Medical Monitor, the benefit of vaccination outweighs the hypothetical increased risk for an AE after vaccination. (As of Amendment 3, decisions regarding subject treatment should be made according to site standard of care as determined by the Principal Investigator.) 
8.5.3 Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use method(s) of contraception from the time of 
signing of the ICF, for the duration of study participation, and for 23 weeks after the last dose of IMP. This is calculated as 5 half-lives of nivolumab (half-life up to 25 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle). Men who are sexually active with woman of child-bearing potential must use method(s) of contraception from the time of signing of the ICF, for the duration of study participation, and for 31 weeks after the last dose of IMP. This is calculated 
as 5 half-lives of nivolumab plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover).  
During the screening period, the Investigator should review contraception methods and the 
time period that contraception must be followed with the subject. The individual methods of contraception for each subject (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) should be determined in consultation with the Investigator. 
8.6 Treatment Compliance 
Subjects are administered the IMP(s) under direct supervision of study personnel. 
9 STUDY PROCEDURES 
All efficacy, PK/PD, immunogenicity, and safety measurements obtained during the course 
of the study are summarized in Table 9-1  and Table 10.2-1 .  Procedures to be followed for 
subjects who are ongoing in the study (i.e., subjects who are continuing to receive study treatment or who are in safety or survival follow-up) at the time of data cutoff for completion of analyses are described in Section 9.5.

9.1 Screening 
No study-specific procedures that are not part of normal care may be initiated prior to the 
subject signing the informed consent in compliance with International Committee on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practices (ICH-GCP) and local legislation. Screening 
evaluations used to determine the subject’s study eligibility must be completed within 
28 days prior to starting treatment unless otherwise specified. Data from procedures that were done as part of normal care may be used once the subject signs the ICF, provided they were done within the screening window. 
At the Screening Visit, the Investigator will review the written ICF with each subject to 
ensure the understanding of the study and the study procedures. The subject, individual obtaining the ICF, will read, sign, and date/time the ICF and any other locally applicable documents. A photocopy of the signed ICF must be provided to the subject and the original 
document retained in the subjects source or study file. The date the screening procedures 
begin will be collected. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 71  During the Screening period, the Investigator should review contraception methods and the 
time period that contraception must be followed. The individual methods of contraception for each subject (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) should be determined in consultation with the Investigator. 
Refer to the study-specific procedure manual for information to be collected for screen 
failures. 
9.2 Baseline and Treatment  
9.2.1 Demographics, Medical History, Pre-treatment Adverse Events 
Subject demographics (race, ethnicity, gender), medical history, and current medical 
conditions will be recorded during the Screening Period. All relevant medical history, including currently active conditions and chronic conditions will be documented. Cancer history should include documentation of HPV or status of tumor for SCCHN. All pre-treatment AEs after signing ICF will also be documented.  
9.2.2 Assessment of Safety Laboratory Parameters  
The central laboratory will provide the required materials for processing the samples, and will 
also provide instructions regarding centrifugation, processing, storage and shipment of samples (as outlined in a Laboratory Manual). The Investigator will receive a laboratory report for information on a per visit basis. Clinical significance including any related comments will be collected.  As of Amendment 3, central laboratory analysis of samples will 
no longer be required (see Section 9.5); laboratory samples should be collected and analyzed 
in accordance with site standard of care procedures for the particular type of cancer.  
Clinical laboratory parameters assessed in this study are displayed in Table 9.2.2-1 . Serum 
samples will be drawn for the determination of ADA as specified in Table 10.2-1 . 
Any clinically important abnormal laboratory values noted during the Screening period will 
be recorded as medical history. If any post-treatment results are judged as being clinically significant by the Investigator, the Investigator should consider whether the result should be recorded as an AE. If deemed necessary, laboratory parameters may be retested or followed 
as unscheduled tests. Unscheduled tests should be performed by the central laboratory unless 
immediate results are required for the subject’s safety. At minimum, the following laboratory abnormalities should be collected as an AE. 
• Any laboratory test result that meets the criteria for a SAE; 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 72  • Any laboratory abnormality that requires the subject to have IMP discontinued or 
interrupted; 
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy. 
All clinically important abnormal laboratory tests occurring during the study will be repeated 
at appropriate intervals until (1) the value returns to baseline, (2) the value is judged to be 
clinically acceptable by the Investigator and the Sponsor, or (3) a diagnosis that explains the abnormal laboratory value is made. When possible, the Investigator should report the clinical diagnosis rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin). 
Clinical laboratory abnormalities that qualify as AEs and any events that lead to an 
intervention (including premature discontinuation of IMP or significant additional concomitant therapy), should be reported and evaluated as AEs.

CONFIDENTIAL 73  9.2.3 Vital Signs 
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements will be performed at each visit identified in 
Table 9-1 . Blood pressure and pulse rate will be performed after the subject has been resting 
for at least 5 minutes. Pulse oximetry will be performed prior to the infusion of nivolumab at each visit identified in Table 9-1 . Any new clinically relevant findings that are identified will 
be reported as AEs. 
9.2.4 Electrocardiograms 
The subject will be supine for at least 5 minutes before the 12-lead ECG is performed. The 
12-lead ECGs will be performed during the Screening period, on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle, 1 and at EOT. All 12-lead ECGs recorded during the study will be obtained in triplicate (all three 12-lead ECGs within a 5-minute time period). All 12-lead ECGs on dosing days must be performed prior to infusion of first IMP and at the end of infusion (± 10 minutes) of mogamulizumab. In case of clinically significant 12-lead ECG abnormalities including a non-screening 12-lead ECG that demonstrates a QTc value 
> 500 msec or QTc interval change of > 60 msec from baseline, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs 
should be obtained over a brief period (e.g., 30 minutes) to confirm prolongation. Additional 12-lead ECGs may also be performed as clinically indicated. The Investigator or designee has the responsibility to read and evaluate the 12-lead ECGs for the timely assessment of subject safety. 
9.2.5 Physical Examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status, Height, and Body Weight 
The Investigator will perform a full physical examination during the Screening period and 
EOT visits. The complete physical examination requires assessment of the following categories: HEENT, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, musculoskeletal, extremities, neurological, 
lymph nodes, and ‘other’. Brief physical examination will be performed at the other 
timepoints specified in Table 9-1 . Brief physical examinations will be symptom directed. All 
significant abnormal findings during the Screening period will be recorded in the Medical History. New abnormal findings or worsening of baseline conditions detected at follow-up physical examinations will be recorded as AEs. A complete physical examination should also be performed when a subject discontinues the trial prematurely. Height will be documented during the Screening period; body weight and ECOG performance status will be measured as specified in Table 9-1 . 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 74  9.2.6 Disease-response Assessments 
High-resolution computed tomography (CT) with oral or iv contrast or contrast-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the preferred imaging modalities for assessing 
radiographic tumor response. If a subject has a known allergy to contrast material, please use local prophylaxis standards to obtain the assessment with contrast if at all possible, or use the alternate modality. In cases where contrast is strictly contraindicated, a non-contrast scan will suffice. Screening assessments should be performed within 28 days of start of treatment and at other time points as specified in Table 9-1 . In addition to chest, abdomen and pelvis, all 
known or suspected sites of disease (including CNS) should be assessed during the Screening period and at subsequent assessments using the same imaging method and technique. If more 
than one method is used during the Screening period, then the most accurate method 
according to RECIST v. 1.1 should be used when recording data, and should again be used for all subsequent assessments. Bone scan, positron emission tomography scan, or ultrasound are not adequate for assessment of RECIST response. In selected circumstances where such modalities are the sole modality used to assess certain non-target organs, those non-target organs may be evaluated less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when CR is identified in target disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
Subjects with signs of symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis should have an MRI of the 
brain.  
Anti-tumor activity will be evaluated using RECIST v. 1.1 (See Appendix 1 ) and 
irRECIST v. 1.1. Evaluations will include serum tumor markers as applicable to the subject’s tumor type. Tumor lesions planned for biopsy should not be used as target lesions for assessment of disease unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the procedure will not interfere with assessment of the subject’s tumor status. New lesions should be measured and recorded. 
For irRECIST v. 1.1 assessments, the following modifications of RECIST v. 1.1 apply: 
• At each time point, the measurements of baseline-selected target lesions and new 
measurable lesions should be combined into the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB), 
and one combined assessment provided.  
• In order to be considered a new measurable lesion, a lesion must meet the same criteria as 
target lesions: a minimum 10 mm in the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions, and a 
minimum 15 mm in short axis for lymph nodes. Smaller new lesions contribute to the non-target or new nonmeasurable tumor burden, but do not get measured. 
• Up to 5 new measurable lesions may be selected. Larger lesions must be preferred as new 
measurable lesions over smaller lesions. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 75  • Non-Target Lesions: In alignment with RECIST v. 1.1, Baseline selected non-target 
lesions can never convert to measurable lesions, not even if they increase in size at 
subsequent time points and become measurable. Only true new lesions can be measured and contribute to the TMTB. 
• All new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new 
non-measurable lesions and are followed qualitatively. Only a massive and unequivocal 
progression of new non-measurable lesions leads to an overall assessment of 
irRECIST-defined progressive disease (irPD) for the time point.  
• Persisting new nonmeasurable lesions prevent irCR. 
• In the absence of clinical deterioration, progression should be confirmed no less than 
4 weeks after the initial irPD assessment. 
9.2.7 Tumor Biopsies Tumor biopsies will be required during the Screening period, except as indicated in the 
Inclusion Criteria, (Section 7.2) and at Week 10 (unless the tumor is inaccessible for biopsy). 
Specific instructions for tumor biopsy and tumor archival sample collection, labeling, storage, packaging, and retention will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
9.2.7.1 Microsatellite Instability Testing  
Microsatellite instability high (MSH) in tumors refers to changes in 2 or more of the 
5 National Cancer Institute-recommended panels of microsatellite markers in tumor tissue. The original (1997) Bethesda guidelines proposed a panel of 5 microsatellite markers for the uniform analysis of MSI in HNPCC. This panel, which is referred to as the Bethesda panel, included 2 mononucleotide (BAT-25 and BAT-26) and 3 dinucleotide (D5S346, D2S123, and D17S250) repeats (Rodriquez-Bigas, 1997). Individual testing sites may utilize a slightly different panel of markers incorporating alternative mononucleotide or dinucleotide markers. Regardless of the panel of markers, samples with instability in 2 or more of these markers are 
defined as MSI-High (MSI-H), whereas those with one unstable marker are designated as 
MSI-L. Samples with no detectable alterations are MSS. 
Sites should query subject’s medical history for prior MSI testing detected by an accredited 
laboratory per local regulations to select subjects with CRC for non-MSI-H tumors. Non-MSI-H status in potential subjects will be done prior to the Screening period as part of standard diagnostic testing by Investigators. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test will be utilized for repeat testing of the non-MSI-H cohort and for testing of responders in other cohorts. Additional tumor samples must be sent to the Sponsor for future confirmatory testing 
for confirmatory studies of the in vitro diagnostic. A lab manual separate from the protocol 
will provide detailed information regarding MSI testing and sample requirements. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 76  9.2.7.2 PD-L1 Testing 
Archival (or fresh) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue must be sent to a third 
party laboratory for determination of PD-L1 status using the analytically validated IHC assay. Either a tissue block or a minimum of 10 unstained tumor tissue sections are acceptable. Submission of fewer than 10 unstained slides may be acceptable in some circumstances following discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
An associated pathology report must be submitted with each tumor tissue specimen. 
PD-L1 stained tissue samples will be assessed by a pathologist at a central laboratory 
identified by the Sponsor and scored as PD-L1 expressing if membrane staining is observed in ≥ 1% tumor cells among a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor cells. 
PD-L1 results will be available prior to enrollment for Phase 2 subjects with non-squamous 
NSCLC. 
9.3 End of Treatment 
End-of-Treatment (EOT) evaluations should be performed within 2 weeks after last dosing 
visit or of the decision to discontinue IMP. The EOT visit should be performed before the start of new anti-cancer therapy.  
9.4 Post-treatment Follow-up Period 
The first follow-up visit will be 30 days (± 5 days) after the last dose of IMP. The second 
follow-up visit will be 100-110 days after the last dose of IMP. Adverse events and SAEs with onset up to 100 days after the last dose of IMP should be reported, as should any SAEs that occur after that time and are considered potentially related to IMPs or study procedures. Subjects will be contacted at least every 100 days after the last dose for survival follow up and recording of new anti-cancer therapies. All new treatments for cancer should be recorded, 
including nivolumab if received after discontinuation from this study. Subjects who complete 
or discontinue treatment without progression will have tumor assessments collected until a new anti-cancer therapy is started, unequivocal disease progression is documented, withdrawal of consent for follow-up contacts, or death.  
9.5 Study Procedures for Subjects Ongoing at the Time of Data Cutoff for 
Completion of Analyses and Preparation of CSR 
For subjects who are continuing to receive study treatment at the time of data cutoff for 
completion of analyses and preparation of the CSR, the Sponsor will continue to supply study 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 77  drug (mogamulizumab and nivolumab) until the subject has completed the maximum 
treatment period of 96 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 (Section 6.3) or until the subject meets one 
of the criteria for removal from therapy as described in Section 7.5.  
Procedures to be followed for all ongoing subjects, i.e., subjects who are continuing to 
receive study treatment or who are in safety or survival follow-up, at the time of data cutoff 
are described below.  These procedures should be implemented upon notification by the 
Sponsor and approval by the appropriate IRB.  
Study Drug Administration (Subjects Actively Receiving Study Treatment) 
Study treatment should continue to be administered according to the protocol (as specified in 
Section 8.1) and the Pharmacy Manual until a maximum treatment period of 96 weeks from 
Cycle 1 Day 1 (Section 6.3) or until any of the criteria for removal of subjects from therapy 
are met (as defined in Section 7.5).   
Efficacy and Safety Assessments 
Investigators should follow study subjects in accordance with the standard of care at their 
Institution with respect to assessments of disease status and safety/tolerability, including the use of local clinical laboratories.  There will be no further central laboratory requirements. 
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and anti-drug antibody 
(ADA) analyses will no longer be collected.  
Survival follow-up contacts and procedures will be discontinued for all subjects.  Data Collection 
Data entry in the electronic data capture system, defined as the clinical database, will be 
terminated for all subjects and all data (including SAEs and treatment-related AEs), upon written notification by the Sponsor.  
Required data collection will be limited to SAEs and treatment-related AEs, which will be 
reported only to the KKD Drug Safety Surveillance Department using the SAE form (see Section 10.3.2.2.1 ).

CONFIDENTIAL 78  10 EFFICACY, PHARMACOKINETIC, SAFETY, AND OTHER 
VARIABLES 
10.1 Study Endpoints 
Primary Endpoints: 
• Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by assessing AEs, and changes in physical 
examination findings, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG readings, and clinical laboratory evaluations. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
• Best overall response (BOR) evaluated using RECIST v. 1.1. BOR is defined as the best 
response designation recorded between the date of first dose of IMP and the date of 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy (excluding on-treatment palliative radiotherapy of 
non-target bone or CNS lesions). Note: Continuation of nivolumab after discontinuing 
combination therapy does not count as start of new therapy for this definition. A BOR of 
CR or partial response (PR) requires confirmation of the assessment at least 4 weeks later. 
• Time to response (TTR): Days from Cycle 1 Day 1 through the first assessment date of 
confirmed CR/PR using RECIST v. 1.1; 
• Duration of response (DOR): Days from the first assessment date of confirmed CR/PR 
through the date of death or PD, whichever is earlier using RECIST v. 1.1; 
• Progression-free survival (PFS): Days from Cycle 1 Day 1 through the date of death or 
PD, whichever is earlier. For subjects whose BOR is PR or CR using RECIST v. 1.1, the 
date of first documentation of objective tumor progression or death which occurs after the last documentation of PR or CR will be used as the event date for PFS;  
• Overall survival (OS): Days from Cycle 1 Day 1 until the date of death. 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
• Pharmacokinetic parameters:  
– Mogamulizumab: observed minimum serum concentration at the end of a dosing 
interval (C
min) and C max; and  
– Nivolumab: C min. 
• Immunogenicity: Anti-mogamulizumab antibody and anti-nivolumab antibody; 
• Pharmacodynamic parameters: biomarkers may include, but are not limited to, immune 
cell subsets and factors such as cytokines and chemokines in tumor and/or blood. 
• Immune-related overall response rate and DOR evaluated using irRECIST. 
10.2 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immunogenicity Assessments Blood sample collection for serum concentrations (PK), PD markers, and ADA will occur at 
baseline and at selected times during the treatment and post-treatment periods ( Table 10.2-1 ).  
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 79  Immunogenicity samples will be analyzed for anti-nivolumab antibodies by a validated 
immunogenicity assay; samples may also be analyzed for neutralizing antibodies by a validated method. Serum samples may be analyzed by an exploratory method that measures anti-drug antibodies for technology exploration purposes; exploratory results will not be reported. 
Details of the collection, storage, and shipment of samples are described in the Laboratory 
Manual. 
As of Amendment 3, blood samples for PK, PD and ADA analyses will no longer be 
collected.

(See Section 9.5 for reporting requirements/procedures for subjects who are ongoing in the 
study, i.e., subjects who are continuing to receive study treatment or who are in safety or 
survival follow-up, at the time of data cutoff for completion of analyses.) 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 81  10.3.1 Definitions 
10.3.1.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP (or biologic) whether or not considered related to the IMP. 
An AE includes but is not limited to:  
• Any clinically significant worsening of a pre-existing condition;  
• An AE occurring from overdose of an IMP; 
• An AE occurring from abuse (e.g., use for non-clinical reasons) of an investigational or 
marketed product. 
The Investigator will inquire about AEs at all subject visits by asking the subject a 
non-leading question such as:  “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” All AEs, 
whether observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject, must be collected. The 
collection of AE and SAE information commences following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study. If a subject experiences an AE or SAE, the subject will receive appropriate treatment and supportive care as necessary, and the Investigator will continue to follow up until there is a return to the subject’s baseline condition, or until a clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved. 
Clinical laboratory abnormalities that qualify as AEs (other than those meeting the definition 
for serious) and any events that lead to an intervention (including premature discontinuation 
of IMP or additional concomitant therapy), other than those reported as SAEs, will be 
reported and evaluated as AEs. Any clinically important changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, x-rays, or any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by the protocol, must also be recorded. 
For this study, disease progression should not be  reported as an AE. Lymphopenia and 
leukopenia are expected pharmacologic effects of mogamulizumab and should also not be  
reported as an AE for this study. Lymphocytes and white blood cell counts will be monitored and evaluated with the laboratory data. 
10.3.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any AE that: • Results in death; 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 82  • Is immediately life-threatening;  
– The term “life-threatening” as part of the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of immediate death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe; 
– If an event is Grade 4 by CTCAE v. 4.03, it does not necessarily meet the definition 
for life-threatening as is required for expedited regulatory reporting of SAEs. 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
– Hospitalizations for pre-planned procedures are not considered SAEs. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; 
• Is another important medical event. Important medical events are those that may not result 
in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered an SAE 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
– Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, or blood dyscrasias that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is a regulatory definition as outlined above. Seriousness (not severity) serves 
as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
10.3.1.3 Causality 
The causal relationship of each AE to the trial medication must be determined by a medically 
qualified individual. The causal relationship should be assessed as one of the following: 
Table 10.3.1-1 Relationship of Adverse Events 
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug administration and the AE 
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE 
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
AE=adverse event.  
10.3.1.4 Severity 
The severity of AEs will be graded using CTCAE v. 4.03. If a subject is responding to an 
ongoing steroid taper and no other intervention is required, the steroid taper should not be 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 83  considered an intervention for the purpose of CTCAE grading of AEs that have otherwise 
resolved to ≤ Grade 1. 
10.3.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
10.3.2.1 Reporting Period 
The collection of AE information begins following the subject's written consent to participate 
in the study. For screen failures, SAEs should be collected and recorded only until the subject fails screening or withdraws consent to participate in the study, except for SAEs that occur outside of that window which are attributed to screening-specific procedures. All AEs with onset after signing of the ICF should be collected. Adverse events which occur prior to first administration of IMP should be identified as occurring pretreatment. No AE data should be entered on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) for screen failures. All AEs and SAEs 
with onset up to 100 days after the last dose of IMP should be reported. The Investigator 
should report any SAE that occurs after this period if the SAE is believed to be related to IMP or to a protocol-specific procedure. (NOTE: Upon implementation of Amendment 3, any treatment-related AEs and SAEs with onset after the last dose of IMP should be reported at the discretion of the Investigator to KKD Drug Safety Surveillance Department using the SAE form (Section 10.3.2.2.1 ). 
10.3.2.2 Reporting Instructions 
The description of each AE will identify the subject, date of onset, the date of resolution, the 
severity of the event, the action taken regarding the IMP, the outcome of the event, and the relationship of the event to the IMP.  
Standard medical terminology should be used to document AEs. In the case of signs and 
symptoms, the underlying illness or diagnosis will be recorded as the event when known. For 
SAEs, a single term for the diagnosis or underlying illness should be recorded on the SAE 
Report form; in the event this is unknown, the chief sign/symptom making the event serious should be recorded. The terms “death” (an outcome) and “hospitalization” may be used for initial reports only if no further information is available in order to avoid a delay in expedited reporting; however, an adequate follow-up report must follow in which the term “death” or “hospitalization” is replaced by the cause of death or hospitalization. 
All IMP-related serious and non-serious AEs must be followed for a final outcome until 
resolution or stabilization. An outcome of “unknown” is not considered to be an acceptable 
final outcome. An outcome of not resolved is an acceptable final outcome for non-serious 
AEs at the end of a subject’s participation in a study, and for SAEs at database lock. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 84  10.3.2.2.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Instructions 
Serious adverse events require expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. 
Any SAE occurring in a clinical study subject and follow-up SAE documentation must be 
reported to the Sponsor’s Drug Safety Surveillance Department or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator having knowledge of the SAE. 
 
 
The Investigator or other qualified individual at the investigative site must complete the SAE form and fax or e-mail it to the Sponsor or designee. All telephone communication 
regarding an SAE must be followed by a written report .  
The Investigator is obligated to immediately report to the Sponsor or designee any SAE occurring at any time during the reporting period (Section 10.3.2.1), independent of the 
circumstances or suspected cause. In addition, the Investigator must promptly report to the Sponsor any SAE occurring at any other time after completion of the study if a causal relationship to IMP is suspected. For all SAEs, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information as requested by the Sponsor in addition to that requested on the SAE form. Information must include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a 
complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of causality. 
Supporting documentation such as hospital discharge summaries or pertinent laboratory reports should also be sent to the Sponsor. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the Sponsor. The Investigator will ensure that information reported immediately by telephone or other means and information entered on the SAE form is accurate and consistent. 
10.3.2.2.2 Notification of Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee of 
Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs to the IRB. The IRB must be informed in a timely manner by the Investigator of SAEs occurring at their site during the study. Investigators must also submit safety information provided by the Sponsor to the IRB as per IRB standard operating procedures.  

Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 85  10.3.3 Other Significant Adverse Events 
10.3.3.1 Urgent Safety Measures 
In accordance with the principles of GCP as laid out in ICH E6, the Investigator(s) has/have 
primary responsibility for assuring subject safety throughout the performance of study 
procedures. An urgent safety measure is defined as any measure which an Investigator may need to implement which is a deviation from, or a change in, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB approval/favorable opinion. 
The Investigator may take appropriate urgent safety measures in order to protect the subjects 
of a clinical trial against any immediate hazards to their health or safety. However, the 
Investigator must inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of having taken such measures . 
10.3.3.2 Adverse Events That Qualify as Dose-limiting Toxicity 
Any AE(s) that qualify as DLT(s) and occur within the DLT evaluation period must be 
reported to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor via phone contact and also to the Drug Safety Surveillance Department or designee using an SAE form (whether or not the DLT is considered an SAE) within 24 hours of the Investigator having knowledge of the 
DLT.  The appropriate forms must also be completed within 24 hours. 
Refer to the Procedure Manual for reporting instructions.  
10.3.3.3 Infusion-related Reactions 
While all infusion-related reactions shou ld be reported as AEs, and any that 
additionally meet serious criteria should also  be reported to the Sponsor's Drug Safety 
and Surveillance Department per SAE reporting guidelines, all Grade ≥ 3 
infusion-related reaction must be reported to the Sponsor’s Drug Safety Surveillance 
Department or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator having knowledge of the event using an SAE form (whether or not the infusion-related reaction is considered an SAE). 
 
 
Refer to the Procedure Manual for reporting instructions. The Investigator or designee at the 
investigative site must complete the SAE form and fax or e-mail it to the Sponsor or 
designee. 
Recommendations for the management of infusion-related reactions are provided in 
Section 8.2.2. 

Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 86  10.3.4 Overdose 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of an IMP 
that is > 10% of the appropriate dose. An overdose should be reported, whether or not 
associated with an AE/SAE, using an SAE form. 
10.3.5 Pregnancy Reporting 
Pregnancy in a female trial participant or partner of a male trial participant must be avoided. 
However, should a pregnancy occur, this process is aimed at ensuring the appropriate 
monitoring of the potential risk related to IMP exposure of pregnant women and/or fetuses as 
well as the risks associated with exposure of a father, regarding congenital abnormalities or birth defects in their offspring. It also ensures compliance with applicable international and local regulations. The requirements are applicable to all subjects following exposure to IMP. 
Female trial subjects :  The subject must be advised by the Investigator to inform him/her 
immediately if she suspects she may be pregnant. The Investigator is obligated to immediately report to the Sponsor or designee any pregnancy occurring at any time after the 
subject signs the ICF and within 23 weeks after the last dose of IMP. 
Male trial subjects :  The subject must be advised by the Investigator to inform him/her 
immediately if they suspect their partner became pregnant after the subject was administered 
IMP. The Investigator is obligated to immediately report to the Sponsor or designee any 
pregnancy occurring at any time after the subject signs the ICF and within 31 weeks after the last dose of IMP. 
When a trial subject reports a pregnancy (post-IMP administration) to the Investigator, IMP 
should be stopped immediately and a pregnancy test should be arranged for the subject (or 
their partner) by the Investigator within seven (7) days of the pregnancy being reported. 
In the case of pregnancy, The Investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor of this event 
and report the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. This includes a study subject as well as the partner of a study subject who becomes pregnant while the subject was receiving IMP. Every attempt will be made to follow the pregnancy to conclusion to obtain information regarding the outcome.

CONFIDENTIAL 87  11 DATA MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Source Data 
Source documents are where data are first recorded, and from which participants’ eCRF data 
are obtained. These include, but are not limited to, hospital records (from which medical 
history and previous and concurrent medication may be summarized), clinical and office 
charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence. 
All documents will be stored safely in confidential conditions. The participant will be 
referred to by the trial participant number/code, not by name, in all data reported to the Sponsor. 
11.2 Access to Data  
Direct access will be granted to authorized representatives from the Sponsor, Contract 
Research Organization, host institution and the regulatory authorities to permit trial-related monitoring, audits and inspections. The Investigator(s) must accept that regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection to verify compliance of the study with GCP. 
11.3 Electronic Case Report Forms  
Subject data will be entered into study eCRFs, in a validated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system. Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable industry standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data. It is the responsibility of the investigative site to prepare and maintain the adequate and accurate eCRFs that have been designed by the Sponsor to record all observations and other data 
pertinent to the clinical investigation. These eCRFs are organized as an ordered series of 
electronic data entry modules specific for each scheduled and unscheduled study visit. 
Only staff listed on the “Delegation of Authority” page in the study file notebook and who 
have been appropriately trained to use the EDC system will be issued user identification (ID) allowing them to make entries and edits to the EDC system and to respond to queries. Only the Investigator will be issued a user ID allowing the application of an electronic signature to a completed study subject record signifying the data has been reviewed and verified as 
complete and accurate. 
The Investigator agrees to treat all subject data used and disclosed in connection with this 
study in accordance with all applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations, including all 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 88  applicable provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and its 
implementing regulations (“HIPAA”). 
The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for the processing and quality control of the 
data. Data management will be carried out by the Sponsor or designee. The handling of data, including data quality control, will comply with all applicable regulatory guidelines. 
Data entry in the electronic data capture system, defined as the clinical database, will be 
terminated for all subjects and all data (including SAEs and treatment-related AEs), upon written notification by the Sponsor (see Section 9.5).   
11.4 Record Keeping and Archiving  
Electronic CRFs, including queries and audit trails, will be retained by the Sponsor or 
designee. Study data and other essential documents should be retained for a minimum of 
2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable legal requirements. Kyowa Kirin Pharmaceutical Development, Inc. or its designee will inform the Investigator, in writing, as to when these documents no longer need 
to be maintained.  
All study documentation at the Investigator’s site and Sponsor’s site will be archived in 
accordance with ICH E6-GCP. 
11.5 Study Monitoring  
Study monitoring will be performed in accordance with ICH E6-GCP, the protocol, and 
applicable local regulations. 
12 STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSIS  
12.1 General Statistical Considerations 
Tabulations of summary statistics, graphical presentations, and statistical analyses will be 
performed using Statistical Analysis System® software. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and frequency distributions and percentages for discrete variables will be utilized. All summaries and analyses conducted will be by tumor type, assigned therapy, and combined total subjects. The specifics for these outputs will be described in detail within the Statistical Analysis Plan. The 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 89  last pre-administration observation will be used as the baseline value for calculating 
post-administration changes from baseline. All data entered into the database will be provided in separate data listings showing individual subject values. The planning and reporting of statistical analysis will be carried out as described in the Sponsor’s or designee’s Standard Operating Procedures governing clinical studies. 
12.2 Populations to be Analyzed 
The following analysis sets will be used in the study: 
• Safety Analysis Set:  Includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of the 
investigational product (even a partial dose of either agent).  
• Efficacy Analysis Set:  Includes all subjects who receive combination therapy in Cycle 1 
Day 1. 
• Pharmacokinetic  Analysis Set:  Includes all subjects who provide at least one post-dose 
concentration measurement.  
• Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set:  Includes all subjects who provide at least one 
post-dose sample. 
Evaluation of the data for this study will consist primarily of data listings and summary 
displays. Demographic and other baseline characteristic information will be summarized for 
the Safety Analysis and Efficacy Analysis Sets. Adverse events will be tabulated by body system, severity, and relation to treatment. Similar presentations will be provided for SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of IMP, and AEs leading to death. The tabulation of laboratory parameters will indicate the normal range for each parameter. Each value will be 
classified as falling above, below, or within the normal range.  
12.2.1 Subject Disposition 
The number of subjects enrolled, completed, discontinued, and replaced will be presented by 
dose cohort including the expansion cohorts. A summary of reasons for discontinuation will be provided. The number of subjects in the Safety Analysis and Efficacy Analysis Sets will 
be summarized as well as the number of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set that were 
excluded from the Efficacy Analysis Set. 
12.2.2 Demographic and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Summaries will include demographics (including age, race, ethnicity, sex, height, weight, and 
body mass index, physical examination results, ECOG PS, and baseline values for 
disease-specific measurements (i.e., sum of longest diameters for solid tumors). 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 90  Medical/surgical history, including prior cancer treatments, will be summarized and listed by 
subject. 
12.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
The World Health Organization Drug Dictionary will be used to classify prior and 
concomitant medications by therapeutic class and preferred term.  
12.2.4 Investigational Medicinal Product Exposure and Compliance 
Extent of exposure in weeks for each subject for the entire treatment period will be 
calculated. Extent of exposure, total number of cycles initiated, and total number of doses 
administered for each investigational product during the treatment period w ill be 
summarized.  
12.3 Efficacy Analysis 
Subjects will be evaluated for tumor response, TTR, DOR, and PFS. The ORR will be 
calculated as the proportion of subjects in the Efficacy Analysis Set who are responders, i.e., 
BOR=CR and PR; the 95% exact CI for ORR will be calculated. The ORR will be derived using both the RECIST v. 1.1 and the irRECIST v. 1.1, based on the efficacy evaluable subjects in each expansion cohort for each combination therapy.  
The DOR, OS, and PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology.  
12.3.1 Sample Size Determination 
The sample size for the dose-finding phase of the study is based on a standard 3+3 
dose-finding design and depends on observed toxicity. With 2 doses under consideration, a maximum of 12 subjects will be required. 
The Simon’s 2-stage optimal design will be used for the expansion cohorts. A cohort may be 
considered for termination due to lack of efficacy if the observed number of tumor responses (either confirmed or unconfirmed) in the first stage is too small. The characteristics of this 
design depend on 2 probabilities: the false positive rate (FPR), the probability of declaring 
the experimental treatment to be superior when in fact it is no better than the historical standard, and the false negative rate (FNR), the probability of concluding the experimental treatment to be no better than the historical standard, when it fact it is superior.

subjects with squamous cell NSCLC have evaluable tumor response data. Guided by the Futility Boundary as shown, the decision to terminate the cohort or to allow it to continue will be made after taking into consideration other relevant observations such as duration and depth of response and risk/benefit profile. The number of subjects receiving treatment at the 
time of the Stage 1 efficacy evaluation may exceed the specified Stage 1 sample size 
depending on accrual rate, response lag, and other factors. 
Upon completion of Stage 1 enrollment for a given cohort, the SRC will review available 
efficacy and safety data and determine whether enrollment into Stage 2 may continue, even if 
not all response data are yet available to determine whether the Stage 1 criteria have been 
met. The SRC may decide that enrollment may continue if the benefit risk assessment is perceived to be positive.

CONFIDENTIAL 93  Immunogenicity may be reported for ADA positive status (such as persistent positive, 
neutralizing positive, only last sample positive, baseline positive and other positive) and ADA negative status, relative to baseline. Effect of immunogenicity on safety, efficacy, biomarkers and PK may be explored. Additional details will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
12.7 Analyses of Safety Data 
The safety and tolerability of the investigational products are determined by reported AEs, 
physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, and laboratory tests. All summaries will be prepared for the entire Safety Analysis Set by tumor type and overall.  
All subjects will be assessed regularly for potential occurrence of AEs from the time 
following the first dose of investigational product until 100 days after the last dose. The 
CTCAE v4.03 system will be used to grade AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs will be grouped and tabulated by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms and system organ class. AEs will be classified by body system, incidence, severity, and causality. All treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized showing the number and percent of subjects for each outcome. 
The results from physical examination will be presented in the subject data listings. Vital sign 
measurements will be summarized at each infusion. The incidence of clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities will be presented, and laboratory data will be summarized at each 
infusion by the CTCAE v. 4.03 toxicity grade. Laboratory data will be presented for subjects having Grade 3 or 4 changes from baseline. 
12.8 Procedures for Missing, Unused and Spurious Data 
Missing values will not be substituted by estimated values, but treated as missing in the 
statistical evaluation. All data from all subjects dosed in the study will be included in all listings, plots, summary tables, and statistical analyses when appropriate. 
12.9 Rules for Excluding Subjects from Analysis 
All dosed subjects will be included in the analyses unless otherwise specified. The Sponsor 
will make any decisions regarding whether any subjects or any individual values belonging to 
a subject will be excluded from the evaluations when the protocol violation is considered to have a negative impact on the scientific aspects and interpretation of the study results. If the subject has received any investigational product, all available safety data will be used. The reason(s) for any exclusion will be described in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).

13 ADMINISTRATION, DOCUMENTATION, AND RECORD 
KEEPING 
13.1 Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board  
Before starting this study, the protocol (authorized by the Sponsor) will be submitted to the 
regulatory bodies/local health authorities (in accordance with local regulations) and to the IRB for evaluation. The protocol will also be signed by the Principal Investigator before submission to the IRB. The study will not start before the IRB gives written approval or a 
favorable opinion in accordance with ICH E6-GCP and all applicable regulatory bodies/local 
health authorities give approval or a favorable opinion as required. 
No changes from the final approved (authorized) protocol will be initiated without prior 
written approval from the Sponsor and without the IRB’s favorable opinion of a written amendment, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects or when the change involves only logistics or administration. The Sponsor will authorize and the Principal Investigator(s) will sign the protocol amendment prior to submission to the IRB. Protocol amendments should be submitted to the IRB without delay. Any significant 
deviation from the protocol when no approved amendment exists will be regarded as a 
protocol violation, and will be addressed as such during the reporting of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL 102  Appendix 1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 
(RECIST v. 1.1) 
This Appendix has been excerpted from the full RECIST v. 1.1 criteria. For information 
pertaining to RECIST v. 1.1 criteria not contained in the study protocol or in this Appendix, please refer to the full publication (Eisenhauer, 2009). 
1 ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL TUMOR BURDEN AND MEASURABLE 
DISEASE 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall 
tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesion. 
1.1 Measurability of Tumor 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• 10 mm by CT scan - (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) 
• 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable) 
• 20 mm by chest x-ray 
• Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. 
Special considerations regarding lesion measurability include:  
Bone Lesions: 
• Bone scan, positron emission tomography scan or plain films are not considered adequate 
imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to 
confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. 
• Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 103  Cystic Lesions: 
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. 
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
Lesions With Prior Local Treatment: 
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. 
Non-measurable Lesions  are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter 
< 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as non-
measurable lesions. Lesions considered non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
1.2 Method of Assessment 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should always be performed rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical examination. 
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. 
Chest x-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest x-ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than x-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest x-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. 
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 104  suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and 
imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may be reviewed at the end of the study. 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. 
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised. 
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. 
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS 
Target lesions: When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to 
a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all 
involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at 
baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), 
be representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may 
be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥ 15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm) should be 
considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for 
all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
Non-target Lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph 
nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or ‘unequivocal progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 105  involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged 
pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). 
3  TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION AND RESPONSE CRITERIA 
3.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage from the baseline study to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions • Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded and should be measured in the same anatomical plane as 
the baseline examination, even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means 
that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be 
zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as 
having a short axis of < 10 mm. 
• Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’: All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). If the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. 
However, when such a lesion becomes difficult to assign an exact measure to then: 
(i) if it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
(ii) if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 106  be assigned in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm 
CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). 
Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment: When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that 
would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the 
lesions have coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’. 
3.2  Evaluation of Non-target Lesions 
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as follows: • When the patient also has measurable disease : To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on 
the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening 
in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall 
tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 
‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify 
for unequivocal progression status. 
• When the patient has only non-measurable disease : To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ 
on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target 
lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Because 
worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions 
are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on 
the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that 
would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e., an increase in tumor burden 
representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% 
increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 107  effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to 
widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in 
therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. 
3.3  New Lesions 
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. The finding of a new 
lesion should be unequivocal: i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). 
This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete 
response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not. 
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be 
constitute PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents new disease. If repeat scans confirm that there is a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
3.4  Tumor Markers 
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor responses. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize in order for a patient to be considered as having attained a complete response. 
4  EVALUATION OF BEST OVERALL RESPONSE 4.1  Time Point Response 
A response assessment should occur at each time point specified in the protocol. 
For patients who have measurable disease at baseline Appendix Table 1 provides a summary 
of the overall response status calculation at each time point. 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3

Response) - Patient with Target (+/-) Non-target Disease 
    
    
    
     
  
   
  
   
    
    
    
    
CR=complete response; NE=inevaluable; PD=progressive disease; PR=partial response; SD=stable disease 
 
4.2  Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation 
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing 
argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. 
4.3  Best Overall Response: all Timepoints 
Best response determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS 
required: Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at 
a subsequent time point as specified in the protocol. In this circumstance, the best overall 
response can be interpreted as in Appendix Table 2.

NE NE NE 
a: If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria  
relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response 
would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when 
subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time 
point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR. 
CR=complete response; NE=inevaluable; PD=progressive disease; PR=partial response; SD=stable disease.  
4.4  Special Notes on Response Assessment 
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF). 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy. The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease as shown in Appendix Table 1 and Table 2. 
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 

Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 110  assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected. 
5 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
5.1  Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). 
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in 
randomized trials, from date of randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the 
reference for calculation of PD). 
5.2  Lesions That Disappear and Reappear 
If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time point it should continue to be 
measured. However, the patient’s response at the point in time when the lesion reappears will depend upon the status of his/her other lesions. For example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR status and the lesion reappeared, then the patient would be considered PD at the time of reappearance. In contrast, if the tumour status was a PR or SD and one lesion which 
had disappeared then reappears, its maximal diameter should be added to the sum of the 
remaining lesions for a calculated response: in other words, the reappearance of an apparently ‘disappeared’ single lesion amongst many which remain is not in itself enough to qualify for PD: that requires the sum of all lesions to meet the PD criteria. The rationale for such a categorization is based upon the realization that most lesions do not actually ‘disappear’ but are not visualized because they are beyond the resolving power of the imaging modality employed. 
5.3  Use of Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography 
While fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) response assessments 
need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
Clinical Protocol 0761-014, Amendment 3   
   
CONFIDENTIAL 111  a) Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. Confirmatory CT is recommended. 
b) No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: 
– If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by CT, this is PD. 
– If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). 
If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that 
is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.

1.0 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Brief	Title 	Multi -center	phase	I/IIa	trial	of	an	autologous	tumor	lysate	(TL)	+	yeast	cell	wall	
particles	(YCWP)	+	dendritic	cells	(DC)	vaccine	in	addition	to	standard	of	care	
checkpoint	inhibitor	of	choice	in	metastatic	melanoma	patients	with	 measurable 	
disease .	
Test	Article 	Name  Autologous TLPLDC vaccine (tumor lysate, particle loaded, dendritic 
cells)  
Activity  Induction of anti -cancer cell -mediated immune response  
Dosage form  Intradermal injection of 1x106 autologous tumor lysate -loaded dendritic 
cells monthly x 4 followed by boosters a t 6 and 9  months . 
Development	
Phase 	Phase I/IIa  
Indication 	 To prevent disease progression in  metastatic melanoma patients  
Rationale 	Setting:  
Responsible for approximately 5% of all skin cancers, melanoma is the cause of 80% of  skin cancer 
related deaths according t o the World Health Organization1.  The 5 -year median survival rate for 
purely local disease is 98% versus a rapid decline to approximately 10 -15% in patients with 
metastatic disease1, 2.  Surgical excision plays a maj or role in loco- regional treatment for melanoma; 
regarding metastatic disease, there exi sts a  20-40% 5 -year survival benefit with metastectomies, 
although truly limited to surgically accessible tumors. Radiation has a limited role in treatment of 
melanoma,  as this cancer  is considered to be radio -resista nt.  Despite multi -modal treatment 
regimens, the population continuing to experience suboptimal treatment outcomes involves stage IV 
disease .  Until recently, m ost treatments for metastatic melanoma were con sidered palliative 
treatments, and patients were encouraged to  enroll into clinical trials once they reached this stage.  
Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) are now approved for use in metastatic melanoma (MM), and a small 
proportion of treated pts will achieve a clinical complete response (CR) and another substantial 
portion will achieve durable partial responses (PR) and stable disease (SD).  However, the majority 
of pts will demonstrate progressive disease (PD).  One hypothesis is that these p atients lack 
sufficient numbers/types of tumor reactive T cells to mount an endogenous, protective, anti -tumor 
immune response.   
Compared to the fusion technology, our new technology is more efficient and utilizes a yeast cell 
wall particle (YCWP) loading system to deliver tumor lysate (TL) to the cytoplasm of DC and 
requires only 120 mL of blood (for DC isolation) and as little as 1 mg of autologous tumor.  The TL, 
particle -loaded, DC (TLPLDC) vaccine can be produced in 48 hrs.  This new technology has been 
tested in precli nical animal models with superior results compared to the prior fusion technology, 
which  showed clinical benefit (SITC 2015).  These results led to a phase I/IIa (n=20) clinical trial of 
the TLPLDC vaccine in multiple solid tumors demonstrating minimal tox icity and a 60% clinically 
beneficial (CR+PR+SD) response rate  and a 30% objective tumor response rate  (ICIC 2015).   
T cell -eliciting vaccines like our TLPLDC vaccine could be used in combination with CPI to 
theoretically improve the clinical efficacy of standard of care (SoC) CPI in MM.      
Vaccine:    
The majority of melanoma vaccines tested to date have been antigen -specific vaccines targeting 
melanoma -specific or associated antigens and utilizing a variety of delivery systems and immune -
adjuvants.  As  opposed to testing an “off the shelf” vaccine that might be able to treat a subset of 
patients, our approach has been personalized to the patient and applicable to all patients.  Our vaccine approach consists of harnessing the most potent antigen presenti ng cell in the body  – the 
dendritic cell (DC ) – together with the full repertoire of tumor antigens from an individual’s cancer.  
We have conducted phase I and II studies using an autologous DC -tumor cell fusion technique that 
has now been simplified into a DC -tumor cell lysate vaccine.  The autologous tumor lysate (TL) is 
loaded into yeast cell wall particles (YCWP) that are naturally and efficiently taken up into the patient’s DC.  These autologous tumor lysate, particle -loaded, DC (TLPLDC) are injected 
intradermally (ID) monthly x 4 followed by boosters at 6 and 9 months.  
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 5	Rationale 	
(continued) 	Prior Results:  
To date, we have vaccinated a total of 36 patients with varying malignancies  with the 
dendritoma fusion technology , and 25 of these have been late -stage melanoma patients .  
These personalized vaccines have a very favorable toxicity profile with only flu -like 
symptoms immediately after inoculations, and no related serious adverse events have been 
observed in any patient vaccinated to date.  In the com pleted phase I/IIa melanoma trial  of 
the dendritoma fusion technology , 25 stage IV patients were vaccinated.  The media n 
overall survival (OS) was 16.1  months (co mpared to a historic rate of 8 -10 months), and 
there was a 29.3 % OS at 5 years .  There was a d ose response with an OS improvement in 
patients receiving ≥3 inoculations compared to patients receiving less (log rank p=0.02 ). 
The fusion technology has now been replaced by the TLPLDC vaccine technology to create personalized autologous tumor/DC vaccine s.  To date, 20 pts have been enrolled to 
the TLPLDC trial with a median follow -up of 7 mos. The study population is 60% male, 
90% Caucasian , 95% stage III/ IV disease , with a median age of 58 years. Th irteen 
different  tumor types have been treated.  Of the 20 pts, 17 had measurable disease  on 
initiation of treatment, and 3 were vaccinated adjuvantly. Twelve patients have completed 
treatment, 6 are in treatment, and 2 are consented but not initiated.  The 12 pts who have 
completed treatment received a med ian of 4 inoculations, and no grade ≥3 toxicities have 
been noted. Flu- like symptoms have been seen in 20%.  Of the 17 pts with measurable 
disease, 10 have completed treatment with 6 demonstrating clinical benefit (1 CR, 2 PR, 3 SD). In the 3 adjuvant pts,  2 have complete d treatment, and all 3 remain disease- free at a 
median follow - up of 11 months.   
 
	Primary	
Endpoint 	1) To determine the safety of adding the TLPLDC vaccine to SoC CPI .   
2) To determine tumor response  with the addition  of the vaccine per RECIST  and 
iRECIST  criteria . 
Secondary	
Endpoints 	1) To compare combination therapy with current ly known rates of AEs and ORR of CPI 
monotherapy.  
Exploratory	
Endpoints 	1) To document  the immunologic response to the vaccine through T- cell assays 
recognizing known melanoma -specific antigens.  
2) To correlate vaccine immune response to clinical outcome.  
Patient	
Population 	Metastatic  melanoma patients  eligible for (or currently  on) SoC CPI with measurable 
disease.   
Treatment	 	 Vaccinated group = autologous tumor cell lysate + yeast cell  wall particles + autologous 
DC 
Number	of	
Patients	 	N= up to 45 
Sample	Size	
Justification 	  45 patients will allow an 80% power of detecting an absolute 25% increase in the 
objective tumor response rate  compared to current SoC CPI monotherapy with an alpha of 
0.05 (one sided).  
Number	of	Sites 	4-8 sites will be established.  
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 6	Duration	of	Trial 	With 4-8 sites enrolling, we anticipate en rollment to be complete in 12  months.  With a 
primary  endpoint of 1  year to monitor the safety of the vaccine and tumor response,  the 
trial duration is expected to be 2 years.  
Trial	Design	 and	
Conduct 	Metastatic	 melanoma	patients	 eligible	for	 (or	currently 	on)	CPI	therapy	per	SoC	 will	
be	identified	and	screened	for	inclusion/exclusion	criteria.		Eligible	patients	will	be	
counseled	and	 consented	for 	tissue	procurement.		 They	will	undergo	 excisional	or	
core	 needle	 biopsy	 as	 clinically	 indicated 	and	 this	 tissue	 will	 be	 shipped	 in	 liqu id	
nitrogen	shippers	through	FedEx	to	our	central	facility	in	Greenville,	SC .The	tumor	
will	 be 	stored	 frozen	 until	 vaccine	 preparation.	 Vaccine	 development	 requires	 48	
hours	for	preparation. 		Upon	verification	that	adequate	tissue	was	obtained,	these	
patie nts	will	then	be	counseled	and	consented	for	 participation	in	the	trial.		 		
The	patients	who	qualify	for	participation	in	this	trial	will	 continue	their	treatment	
of	CPI .	Once	consented,	 patients	will	receive	 a	single	injection 	of	Neupogen	(G -CSF)	
300	µg	SQ	24 -48	hrs	prior	to	having	7 0	mL	of	blood	collected	 and	sent	to	our	central	
facility	for	DC	isolation	and	preparation. 		Those 	who	can not	tolerate	Neupogen	or	
refuse	 it	will	have	120	mL	of	blood	drawn	and	sent. 		Additional	blood	may	be	drawn	
if	additional	vaccine	doses	need	to	be	made	or	re -made	for	any	reason.	 Vaccines	will	
be	prepared	by	producing	TL	through	freeze/thaw	cycling	and	then	loaded	into	pre -
prepared	YCWP.		The	TL -loaded	YCWP	will	be	 introduced	to	the 	DC	for	phagocytosis	
thus	creating	the	TLPLDC	 vaccine,	which	 will	be	frozen	in	single	dose	vials.			 Each	
vial	will	contain	1	x	106	TLPLDC	and	will	be	labeled	with	the	patient’s	unique	study	
number. 		
The	 frozen	 autologous	TLPLDC	 will	be	sent	back	to	the	sit e	with	a	total	of	 6	single	
dose	vials	 after	the	vaccine	has	completed	QA/QC	testing	and	lot -release	(usually	3	
weeks) .		The	primary	vaccination	series	will	include	monthly	 inoculations	at	0,	1,	2,	
3	months 	followed	by	boosters	at	6	 and	9	 months	in	the	same 	lymph	node	draining	
area	 (preferably	 the	 anterior	 thigh).	 	 Once	 received,	 the	 first	 inoculation	 should	
occur	within	4	weeks. 	
Safety	data	will	be	collected	on	local	and	systemic	toxicities	and	graded	and	reported	
per	the	Common	Terminology	Criteria	for	Adv erse	Events	(CTCAE)	v4.03. 	
Patients	will	follow -up	at	their	respective	sites	for	evaluation	of	metastatic	disease	
per	SoC.		They	will 	under	imaging,	CT/PET -CT,	to	meet	 Response	Evaluation	Criteria	
in	Solid	Tumors	(RECIST) 	criteria 	version	1.1	and	 iRECIST 	to	monitor	disease. 	
Blood	(50	mL)	will	be	collected	fro m	all	patients	prior	to	each	inoculation	and	at	 12	
months	from	enrollment	for	a	total	of	7	time	points	or	a	total	of	350	mL	of	blood	over	1	year.	 	 The	 collected	 blood	 will	 be	 sent	 to	 our	 central	 facil ity	 for	 immunologic	
testing	of	T -cell	response s.

2.0	 INTRODUCTION 		
Responsible	 for	approxi mately	5%	of	all	skin	cancers,	 melanoma	 is	the	cause	of	 80%	
of	skin	cancer	related	deaths	according	to	the	W orld	 Health	 Organization1.	The	5-
year	median	 survival	rate	for	purely	local	disease	is	98%	versus	a	rapid	decline	to	
approximately	 10-15%	 in	 patients	 with	 metastatic	 disease1,	 2.		Surgical	 excision	
plays	 a	 major	 role 	in	loco-regional	 treatment	 for	 melanoma;	 regarding	 metastatic	
disease,	 there	 exits	 at	 20 -40%	 5-year	 survival	 benefit	 with	 metastectomies,	
although	 truly	limited	to	surgically	accessible	tumors.	 Radiation 	has	a 	limited	role	in	
treatment	of	melanoma,	 as	it	 is	considered	to	be	 radio-resist ant.	For	resections	with	
inadequate	margins,	positive	nodal	disease	status	post	lymphadenectomy,	and	brain	metastases	 are	instances	 in	 which	 radi ation	 can	 be	 used	 for	 further	 loco -regional	
control	of	disease
2,	3.			
The	addition	of	r adiation	has	been	associated 	with	a	 10%	rate	of	local	recurrence	
compared	to	 a	40.6%	rate	in	 those	who	did	not	receive	radiation	in	high	risk	node	
positive	 patients.	 	 Th ese	 results	 are	 associated	 with	 the	 risk	 of	 development	 of	
lymphedema2.	 	The	 risk	 of	 recurrence	 is	 the	 highest	 within	 the	 first	 5	 years	 of	
diagnosis .		Despite	 multimodal	 treatment	 regimens,	 the	 population	 continuing	 to	
experience	 poor	 treatment	 outcomes	 involves	 stage	 IV	 disease. 		To	 date,	 most	
treatments	 for	 metastatic	 melanoma	 are	 considered	 palliative	 treatments,	 and	
patients	 are	 encouraged	 to	 enroll	 into	 cl inical	 trials	 once	 they	 have	 reached	 this	
stage.	 			
	The	 mainstay	of	 treatment	 for	metastatic	melanoma	is	systemic	therapy.		 The	only	
FDA	 approved	 chemotherapeutic	 medication	 is	 dacarbazine,	 and	 its	 oral	preparation	 temozolomide.	 	 These	 medications	 have	 sh own	 minimal	 overall	
survival	(OS)	benefit,	median	OS	6.4	and	7.7	months,	 respectively	with	a	12%	and	
14%	 objective	 response	 rate	 (ORR),	 respectively
4.	 	 Despite	 poor	 outcomes	 with	
monotherapy,	 all	 other	 chemotherapeutic	 drugs,	 such	 as	 taxanes	 and	 vinca	
alkaloids,	have	similar	poor	results .	Cytokine	t herapy	 is	another	 modality,	which	 has	
showed	 notable	shifts	in	management	of	metastatic	melanoma.	 Interleukin-2	(IL -2),	
known	to	stimulate	T-cell	proliferation	and	further	release	of	cytokines ,	when	used	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 9	in	 high	 doses	 was	 associated	 with	 a	 16%	 objective	 response	 rate	 ( complete	
response	(CR)	6%,	and	partial	response	(PR)	10% )4,	 5.	This	data	was	obtained	via	
retrospective	 analysis	 of	 several	 trials	 from	 1985 -1993	 where	 high	 dose	 IL -2	 was	
given	over	a	5	day ,	as	tolerated,	with	multiple	cycles	occurring	every	 6-12	weeks.		Of	
the	patient’s	whom	experienced	tumor	response,	there	was	no	evidence	of	disease	
progression	 after	 5-years5.	Interferon-alpha	 (IFN-α),	 also	 involved	 in	 systemic	
inflammation,	 is	the	only	FDA	approved	drug	for	adjuvant	therapy	with	metastatic	
melanoma3,	 4.		Four	 trials	 have	 st udied	 this	 drug,	 the	 most	 significant	 by	 the	
European	Organization	 for	Research	and	Treatment	of	Cancer	(EORTC)	randomizing	
patients	 with	resected	stage	III	melanoma	 to	5	years	of 	pegylated -IFNα, 	pegylated	to	
increase	the	drugs	half -life,	 versus	observation .		After	median	follow-up	of	7.6	years,	
the	 reduction	 in	 relative	 risk	 of	 recurrence	 was	 39.1%	 versus	 34.6%	 in	 the	
observation	 group3,	 6.	The	 results	 with	 these	 medications	 were	 not	 devoid	 of	 side	
effects.		Many	include	fever,	chills,	 myalgias	and	malaise4.	IL-2	has	 been	 associated	
with	hypotension,	arrhythmias	and	even	 systemic	inflammatory	response	 requiring	
close	 monitoring	 during	 treatment.	 Neither	 of	 these	 medicatio ns	 has	 shown	 a	
significant	improvement	in	overall	survival 	(OS).		In	addition ,	combination	therapy,	
termed	biochemotherapy,	also	 demonstrated	 significant	toxicities	with	no	survival	
benefit.		 Interestingly,	the	use	of	IL-2	and	IFN -α	did	reveal	that	stimulation	of	the	
immune	 system	 can	 effectively	 destroy	 tumors	 in	 metastatic	 melanoma	 patients.		
Creating	 an	 immune	 system	 capable	 of	 eradicating 	metastatic	 tumor	 burden	 and	
preventing	 recurrence;	 therein	 lies	 the	 ideology	 behind	 further	 immunotherapy	
development	for	the	 management	of	stage	IV	melanoma.		
	
Targeted	 therapies	 have	 been	 developed	 as	 further	 research	 has	revealed	 specific	
mutations	 associated	 with	 melanoma.	 	 Medications	 targeting 	B-RAF	 signal	
mutations	in	melanoma	tumors	include	vemurafenib	and	dabrafenib.		 	
A	phase	III	trial	comparing	vemurafenib	to	dacarbazine ,	in	patients	with	metastatic	
melanoma	with	no	prior	treatments,	 revealed	increase	in	progression	free	survival	
(PFS)	6.9	months	versus	1.6	months 	and	median	OS	13.6	months	versus	9.7	months	
(both	 p<0.001)7.	 	Dabrafenib	 was 	also	 evaluated 	in	 a	 phase	 III	 trial	 against	
dacarbazine	 revealing	 a	 PFS	 of	 5.1	 months	 versus	 2.7	 months	 (p<0.0001)2.	 	 An	
additional	 drug	 trametinib,	 an	 oral	 medication	 which	 inhibits	 a	 downstream	
molecule,	 MEK1	 and	 MEK2,	 has	 shown	 efficacy	 in	 a	 phase	 III	 trial	 versus	chemotherapy	 revealing	 a	 PFS	 of	 4.8	 months	 versus	 1.5	 months
2.	 	 Toxicities	 for	
these	medications	include	arthralgias, 	development	of	squamous	cell	carcinoma	and	
photosensitivity.	 	 Although	 effective,	 these	 medications	 can	 only	 be	 used	 in	approximately	50%	of	patients	with	melanoma	who	have	this	mutation
2,	7.		
	The	final	group	of	developed	drugs	for	treatment	of	metastatic	melanoma	includes	the	 check	 point	 inhibitors	 (CPI).	 	 These 	medications	 are	 human	 monoclonal	
antibodies	 used	 to	 prevent	 interaction	 of	 tumor	 cell	 surface	 molecules	 used	 to	
downregulate	the	immune	system	thus	preventing	activation	of	T -cells.		The	initial	
CPI	 used	 for	 metastatic	 melanoma,	 ipilimumab,	 is	 an	 anti-cytotoxic	 T	 lymphocyte	
antigen-4	 (anti -CTLA -4)	 antibody.	 This	 medication	 has	 been	 extensively	 studied,	
and	received	 FDA	 approval	 in	 2011.	 	 A	 phase	 III	 trial	 was	 completed	 on	 patients	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 10	with	 stage	 III/IV	 melanoma,	 where	 patients	 were	 randomized	 into	 three	 groups,	
Ipilimumab	 alone,	 a	 peptide	 vaccine, 	gp100	 alone,	 or	 ipilimumab	 and	 gp100.		
Median	OS	was	noted	to	be	10.1	months,	6.4	months	and	10	months ,	respectively.	
There	were	no	statistically	significant	differences	between	the	two	group s	involving	
ipilimumab1.		In	addition,	 this	medication	was	compared	to	dacarbazine	in	a	phase	
III	 trial.	 	 The	 two	 treatments	 included	 ipilimumab	 and	 dacarbazine	 versus	
dacarbazine	alone	in	untreated	metastatic	melanoma	patients.		The	overall	survival	
was	11.2	months	versus	9	months ,	respectively .	As	evidenced	in	a	CTLA-4	knock -out	
animal	model,	the	animals	all	died	from	severe	lymphoproliferative	disease ;	it	is	not	
unexpected	 that	 significant	 autoimmune	 toxicities	 are	 associated	 with	 this	
medication1.	 	These	 are 	characterized	 mostly	 as 	skin	 and	 gastrointestinal	 (GI)	
toxicities,	 with	 8 -23%	 of	 patient’s	 experiencing	 grade	 III/IV	 GI	 toxicities.		
Specifically,	 patients	 may	 experience	 severe	 diarrhea/colitis,	 hypophysitis,	 uveitis,	
and	 hepatitis.	 	 Although	 reported	 to	 be	 managed	 with	 corticosteroids	 and	 anti-
interferon	 gamma	 (anti -IFN-γ),	 these	 significant	 toxicities	 definitely	 reflect	 likely	
poor	compliance	with	the	medication1,	8.	
	The	 second	 class	 of	 CPI	 drug s	 includes	 monoclonal	 anti-PD1	 antibodies ,	 again	
functioning	 to	 block	 suppress ion	 of	 T-cell	 activation, 	nivolumab	 and	
pembrolizumab.	 	 Both	 drugs	 have	 been	 approved	 by	 the	 FDA	 for	 treatment	 of	
metastatic	 disease	 that	 has	 failed	 management	 with	 anti -CTLA -4	 antibody	 or 	
mutated	BRAF	inhibitor	therapy	 if	indicated .		Also	extensively	studied,	a	 phase	III	
trial	 comparing	 nivolumab	 to	 dacarbazine	 in	 stage	 III/IV	 unresectable	 melanoma	
without	 the	 BRAF	 mutation	 revealed	 significant	 differences;	 a	 total	 of	 68%	 of	 the	patient	population	were	previously	treated	with	chemotherapy	prior	to	enrollment	
in	the	trial,	evenly	distributed	between	the	two	treatment	arms.			
The	12	month	OS	was	72.9%	versus	42.1%	in	the	two	arms,	 respectively,	with	an	
ORR	 of	 40%	 with	 nivolumab	 (CR	 7.6%)	 and	 13.9%	 with	 dacarbazine	 (CR	 1.0%)	(p<0.001)
9.		Another	 phase	 III	 trial	 revealed	 similar	 promising	 results	 when	
comparing	 two	dosing	regimens	of	pembrolizumab	 (10mg/kg	every	2	weeks	versus	
every	 3	 weeks)	 t o	 ipilimumab.	 	 This	 trial	 included	 unresectable	 stage	 III/IV	
melanoma	patients.		 Patients	 in	the	 pembrolizumab	treatment	arms	experienced	12	
month	 OS	 of	 74.1%	 and	 68.4%	 in	 the	 every	 2	 week	 versus	 every	 3	 week	 dosing	
regimens.	 	 	 	 They	 were	 compared	 to	 a	 58.6%	 12	 month	 OS	 associated	 with	
ipilimumab	treatment	(p=0.0005)10.	Interestingly,	 the	PD1	inhibitors	appear	to	be	
superior	to	th e	CTLA -4	inhibitors	in	terms	of	toxicity.	Although	the	patients	treated	
with	pembrolizumab	did	experience	grade	3	toxicities	(13.3%	and	10.1%	according	to	treatment	dosing	every	2	weeks	versus	3	weeks) ,	the	anti -PD1	therapy 	compared	
favorably	to	the	 19.9%	 with	ipilimumab.		The 	majority	 of	the	toxicities	 were	related	
to	cutaneous	toxicities,	thyroid	de rangements	and	diarrhea
11.			
	
In	September	2015,	 the	FDA	approved	a	new	treatment	regimen	using	combination	
therapy	with	 two	CPI	for	metastatic	melanoma,	ipilimumab	and	 nivolumab	 followed	
by	nivolumab	maintenance	therapy.	 This	new	approval	was	obtained	after	a	phase	II	
double -blinded	 trial	 randomizing	 142	 patients	 with	 no	 prior	 treatment	 to	
combination	 therapy	 with	 ipilmumab	 plus	 nivolumab	 versus	 ipilimumab	 plus	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 11	placebo	 reveal ed	a	 61%	 ORR	 in	 the	 combination	 arm	 compared	 to	 11%	 in	 the	
ipilimumab	plus	placebo	arm12.		Approximately	39%	patients	 had	a	partial	response	
on	 combination	 therapy,	 with	 potentially	 80%	 of	 those	 partial	 response s	 being	
durable. 	However,	 the	 combination	 did	 produce	 significant	 toxicities	 with	 54%	 of	
patients	 experienc ing	grade	 3	 or	 4	 toxicities	 in	 the	 combination	 arm	 versus	 24%	
with	ipilimumab	alone.		T he	most	common	cause	for	discontinuation	of	the	trial	 was	
toxicity	in	the	combination	arm	(45%)	and	disease	progression12.			
	
During	this 	same	period	of	targeted	therapy	 devel opment,	recognition	of 	the	high	
potential	for	dendritic	cells	(DC)	 to	aid	 in	the	 develop ment	of	 appropriate	immune	
responses	 for	 management	 of	 solid	 tumors	 also	 occurred .	These	 cells	 innately 	
possess	 receptors	 necessary	 for	 T -cell	 stimulation.	 Initially	 introducing	 specific	
tumor	 associated	 antigens	 to	dendritic	 cells	 in	 order	 to	 stimulate	 MHC	 Class	 I-
mediated	 cytotoxic	 T -cells	 (CTL) 	was	 evaluated .	 	 Due	 to	 a	 system	 limited	 by	 the	
number	of	identifiable	antigens,	 we	have	pursued	 DC	fusion	with	 tumor	as	a	vaccine	
strategy.	 	 Through	 the	 strong	 immunogenicity	 produced	 by	 DC,	 in	 addition	 to	creating	a	vaccine	with	multiple	antigens	by	utilizing	a	complete	sample	of	the	solid	tumor,	 more	 effective	 vaccines	 were	 produced
2.	Pilot	 studies	 were	 conducted	 in	
stage	IV	melanoma	and	stage	IV	renal	cell	carcinoma	patients	testing	the	 fusion	of	
DC	 with	 tumor	 cells	 termed	 dendritoma	 and	 used	 with	 IL-22.	 	 These	 pilot	 studies	
revealed	 the	 dendr itomas	 to	 be	 immunogenic,	 leading	 to	 a	 significant	 increase	 in	
interferon-gamma	 (IFN-γ)	 producing	 T -cells.	 	 Clinically,	 stabilization	 or	 partial	
responses	 were	 observed	 in	 40%	 of	 stage	 IV	 RCC	 patients	 involved.		In	 the	
completed	phase	I/IIa	melanoma	trial	 of	the	dendritoma	fusion	technology,	25	stage	
IV	 patients	 were	 vaccinated.	 	 The	 median	 overall	 survival	 (OS)	 was	 16.1	 months	
(compared	to	a	historic	rate	of	8 -10	months),	and	there	was	a	29.3%	OS	at	5	years.		
There	 was	 a	 dose	 response	 with	 an	 OS	 improvemen t	 in	 patients	 receiving	 ≥3	
inoculations	compared	to	patients	receiving	less	(log	rank	p=0.02)16.	
	
Multiple	DC-based	vaccines	 have	now	been	studied	 along	with	a	multitude	of	other	
vaccine	 strategies,	 but	 t he	 only	 FDA	 approved	 cancer	 vaccine,	 Spileucel	 –	T	 or	
Provenge,	 is	a	DC-based	 vaccine	 where	 DC	 are	incubated	 with	 a	 fusion	 protein 	
PA2024	 (prostatic	 acid	 phosphatase	 and	 granulocyte	 macrophage	 colony-
stimulating	 factor).	 	 The	 vaccine	 is	 approved	 for	 use	 in	 c astration -resistant	
metastatic	 prostate	cancer 	patients .	Results	from	the	phase	III	study	of	this	vaccine	
versus	 placebo	 resulted	 in	 a	 median	 OS	 of	 25.9	 months	 versus	 21.4months	 in	 the	
placebo 	group	(p<0.02)8.	Despite	the	efficacy,	significant	effort	is	required	in	order	
to	 produce 	these	 autologous	 ce ll-based	 vaccines.	 	 The 	final	 vaccine s	 are 	not	
available	 for	several	 weeks	 due	 to	 long	 incubation	 periods,	 in	 addition	 to	 quality	
assurance	protocols,	 and	the	requirement	for	 a	large	 volume	of	blood 	greatly	affect	
the	efficiency	of 	production. 	
	
Thus,	 we	 have	 developed	 a	 new	 highly	 efficient	 technique	 for	 introducing	 tumor	
lysate	 into	 the	 cytoplasm	 of	 DC	 using	 denatured	 yeast	 cell	 wall	 particles	 (YCWP).		
These	 tumor	lysate-loaded	particles 	are	incubated	and	phagocytized	by	 autologous	
DC	 forming	 the	 tumor	 lysate ,	particle-loaded,	 dendritic	 cell	 (TLPLDC)	 vaccine.		
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 12	These	 vaccines	 require	 less	 tissue, 	small	 quantities	 of	 blood,	 and	 are	 produced	
within	 48	 hours14.	 	 This	 new	 method	 was	 used	 in	 a	 B16	 metastatic	 melanoma	
murine	model.		The	TLPLDC	vaccine	was	created	with	lysed	tumor	cells	from	B16F0	
melanoma	 and	each	mouse	injected	with	3	weekly	doses	for	up	to	4	weeks.		All	mice	
were	sacrificed	at	the	end	of	the	observation	period,	and	lungs	harvested	to	identify	
and	count	 pulmonary	metastasis.		 All	mice	who	received	the	TLPLDC	vaccinations	
showed	 no	 evidence	 of	 metastatic	 disease	 compared	 to	 controls	 (p<0.01) .		The	
median	survival	for	 mice	 in	the	 control	arm	was	21	days	compared	to	29	days	with	
TLPLDC	and	41	days	with	TLPLDC	with	CpG	adjuvant. 		Additional	 preclinical	data	
has	 demonstrated	 that	 the	 TLPLDC	 vaccine	 is	 actually	 superior	 to	 the	 fusion	
dendritoma	 technology	 in	 the	 same	 murine	 metastatic	 melanoma	 model14.		
Therefore,	 t he	 fusion	 technology	 has	 now	 been	 replaced	 by	 the	 TLPLDC	 vaccine	
technology	to	c reate	personalized	autologous	tumor/DC	vaccines.		To	date,	20	pts	
have	been	enrolled	to	the	TLPLDC	trial	with	a	median	follow-up	of	7	mos.	The	study	population	is	60%	male,	90%	Caucasian,	95%	stage	III/	IV	disease,	with	a	median	
age	of	58	years.	Thirteen	d ifferent	tumor	types	have	been	treated.		Of	the	20	pts,	17	
had	 measurable	 disease	 on	 initiation	 of	 treatment,	 and	 3	 were	 vaccinated	
adjuvantly.	Twelve	patients	have	completed	treatment,	6	are	in	treatment,	and	2	are	
consented	but	not	initiated.		The	12	pts 	who	have	completed	treatment	received	a	
median	 of	 4	 inoculations,	 and	 no	 grade	 ≥3	 toxicities	 have	 been	 noted.	 Flu-like	symptoms	have	been	seen	in	20%.		Of	the	17	pts	with	measurable	disease,	10	have	
completed	treatment	with	6	demonstrating	clinical	benefit	(1	CR,	2	PR,	3	SD).	In	the	3	 adjuvant	 pts,	 2	 have	 completed	 treatment,	 and	 all	 3	 remain	 disease-free	 at	 a	
median	follow-	up	of	11	months.				
	
Both	the	fusion	dendritoma	technology	and	the	current	TLPLDC	vaccine	technology ,	
both	 autologous	 tumor/DC	 vaccines,	 have	 shown	 promise	 in	 patients	 with	
metastatic	 melanoma.		From	 these	 trials	 arose	 an	 on-going	 randomized	 phase	 IIb	
trial	utilizing	th e	TLPLDC 	vaccine	in	the	adjuvant	setting	 to	prevent	recurrence	in	
high	risk	melanoma	patients.		
	
Recognizing	 the	 utilit y	 of	 the	 CPI	 and	 the	 immunogenicity	 of	 the	 TLPLDC	
vaccination,	 merging	these	two	treatment	methods	may	lead	to	a	more	robust	and	
effective	anti-tumor	immune	response.	The	 tumor-reactive	T	cells	 stimulated	 by	the	
TLPLDC	vaccine	 may	become	 inactivated	in	the 	tumor	microenvironment	due	to	T-
cell	 downregulation 	by	 the	 tumor .		In	 fact,	 this	 may	 explain	 the	 failures	 of	 most	
cancer	vaccines	in	general	that	have	been	tested	in	the	metastatic	setting.		 CPI	could	
aid	in	overcoming	this	mechanism	of	 tumor	cell	evasion	 by	blocking	these	inhibitory	
signals	and	allowing	the	T	cells	to	attack	the	tumor.		Likewise,	CPIs	 are	limited	in	
their	effectiveness	based	on	the	availability	of	tumor -reactive	T-cells.		Therefore,	the	
use	of	CPI	+	 vaccines	makes	intuitive	sense.			
	
There	may	be	some	concern	regarding	the	toxicity	associated	with	the	combination	of	 these	 modalities;	 however,	 one	 could	 also	 argue	 that	 the	 combination	 could	
theoretically	reduce	the	toxicity	of	the	CPI.		First,	the	vaccines	are	inherently	safe	
and	have	never	 been	shown	to	produce	autoimmunity;	therefore,	if	toxicity	were	to	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 13	increase	 with	the	combination,	 it	would	likely	be	related	to	the	increased	activity	of	
tumor	 destruction	 not	 autoimmunity.	 	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 since	 the	 vaccine	 will	
induce	 larger	 numbers	 of	 tumor -reactive	 T	 cells,	 the	 dose	 of	 the	 CPI	 may	 be	
decreased	 perhaps	 resulting	 in	 less	 toxicity .	 	 Furthermore,	 the	 larger	 number	 of	
tumor-reactive	T	cells	may	bind	a	higher	proportion	of	the	CPI	leaving	less	to	bind	
to	auto-reactive	T	cells.		Either	mechanism	may	lead	to	lower,	not	higher,	toxicity	with	the	combination	of	CPI	and	TLPLDC	vaccine.			
	
This	 prospective,	 open	label,	multicenter	phase	I/IIa	trial	will	assess	the	effects	of	
utilizing	both	a	CPI	and	the	TLPLDC	vaccine	in	 metastatic	 melanoma	patients	 with	
measurable	 disease	 eligible	for	(or	currently	 on)	standard	of	care	CPI 	therapy.		By	
developing	 an	 adaptive	 immunity	 to	 melanoma	 via	 the	 TLPLDC	 vaccine,	 and	
inhibiting	 the	 down	 regulation	 of	 T-cells	 via	 tumor-induced	 immunosuppression	
with	the	CPI,	the	tumor	response	rates	would	be	expected	to	increase	relative	to	the	results	experienced	when	 these	m odalitie s	are	used	individually.	 	
	
3.0	 OBJECTIVES 	
In	 this	 study,	 we	 intend	 to	 assess	 the	 safety	 and	 tumor	 response	 of	 utilizing	 an	
autologous 	tumor	 lysate,	 particle -loaded,	 dendritic	 cell	 ( TLPLDC )	vaccine	 given	 in	
combination	with	standard	of	care	 (SoC)	 checkpoint	inhibitors 	(CPI)	 in	patients	with 	
stage	IV	melanoma	with	 measurable	disease.

4.0	 STUDY	DESIGN 	
	
4.1	 Description	of	Study 	
This	 will	 be	 a	 prospective,	 open	 label,	 multi-center	 phase	 I/IIa	 tria l	utilizing	 the	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 14	TLPLDC	 vaccine 	added	 to	 SoC	 CPI	 for	 treatment	 of	 metastatic	 melanoma.	 The	
vaccine	 to	 be	 used	 in	 this	 study	 remains	 an	investigational	 drug	 under	 the	 IND	
16101.	 The	Sponsor 	of	this	IND	is	 Elios	Therapeutics,	LLC .	
The	 target	 study	population	includes 	metastatic	 melanoma	 patients 	eligible	for	 (or	
currently	on )	CPI	therapy	 per	their	provider’s	choice 	and	with	measurable	 disease.		
Up	to	45	patients	will	be	enrolled 	over	approximately	one	year	at	4 -8	sites.		These	
patients	must	be	able	to	 tolerat e	CPI	 treatment	if	already	started .		
Each	 patient	 must	 have	 biopsy	 proven	 evidence	 of	 metastatic	 disease 	and	
measurable	on	imaging	studies.	
Prior	to	participation	in	the	trial,	e ligible 	patients	will	be	counseled	 and	consented	
on	the	process	of 	tissue	procurement.	 These	 patients	will	have	t umor	acquired	for	
vaccine	production	via	 core	needle	biopsy	or	excisional	biopsy 	(need	not	occur	at	
the	study	site) ,	and	a	portion	(approx.	 1	cm3	preferred	but	1	mg	minimum)	 of	their	
melanoma	sterilely	frozen	in	provided	freezing	vials	and	storage	tubes.	 This	tissue	
will	then	 be	shipped	in	liquid	nitrogen	shippers	through	FedEx	to	our	central	facility	
in	Greenville,	SC	 and	stored	frozen	until 	vaccine	preparation .					
Upon	 verification	 of	 adequate	 amount	 of	 tumor	 procured,	 patients 	will	 then	 be	
counseled	and	consented	for	 full	participation	in	the	trial.		 Each	patient 	will	receive	
a	 single	 injection	 of	 Neupogen	 (G -CSF)	 300	 µg	 subcutaneously	 24 -48	hrs	 prior	 to	
having	 70	mL	of	blood	collected	and	sent	to	our	central	facility	for	DC	isolation	and	
preparation.		 Patients, 	who	 cannot 	tolerate	Neupogen	or	refuse	it,	will	have	120	mL	
of	 blood	 drawn	 and	 sent 	to	 our	 central	 facility	 for	 DC	 isolation	 and	 preparation.	
Additional	 blood	 may	 be	 drawn	 if	 additional	 vaccine	 doses	 need	 to	 be	 made	 or	
remade	for	any	reason.	 Excess	tumor,	serum	and	 blood	will	be	placed	into	a	tissue	
repository	 and	stored	under	the	patient’s	unique	study	number	for	future	use	in	re -
creating	the	vaccine	and	performing	immunologic	assays.		Additionally,	any	stored	
tumor,	serum	or	blood	may	also	be	utilized	to	assess	new	generations	of	vaccines.					 	
During	 the	 time	 between	 enrollment	 and	 the	 first	 vaccine	 inoculation 	
(approximately	 3-7	weeks	after	 enrollment),	each	patient	should	 undergo	imaging	
to	 determine	 baseline	 metastatic	 disease	 and	 baseline	 labs,	 including	 lactate	dehydrogenase .		Each	 patient	 must	 obtain	 a	 cross	 sectional 	chest,	 abdomen	 and	
pelvis 	imaging	 with	contrast,	MRI	Brain/CT	Head	with	intravenous	contrast ,	and/or	
total	body	PET	per	institutional	preference	per	standard	of	care .		Baseline	imaging	
studies	 must	 be	 completed	 within	 4	 weeks	 of	 first	 vaccine	 dose.	 	At	 this	 point,	 a	
maximum	of	5	tumor	foci	(maximum	of	2	foci	per	organ)	will	be	identified	 by	the	
site	 primary	 investigator 	that	 are	 easily	 measurable	 and	 designated	 as	the	 target	
lesions.	 These	 tumors	 must	 be	 at	 least	 10mm	 in	 size	 per	 RECIST	 1.1	criteria 	
(Appendix	 B).	 Baseline	 non -target	 lesions	 will	 also	 be	 documented.		Additionally,	
iRECIST	criteria	will	be	applied	(Appendix	B)						
Vaccines	 will	 be	 prepared	 by	 producing 	tumor	 lysate	 (TL)	 through	 freeze/thaw	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 15	cycling	 of	the	autologous	tumor	 and	then	loaded	into	pre -prepared	 yeast	cell	wall	
particles	 (YCWP).	 	 The	 TL -loaded	 YCWP	 will	 be	 introduced	 to	 isolated 	DC	 for	
phagocytosis;	thus	creating	the	TLPLDC	vaccine	which	will	be	frozen	in	single	 dose	
vials.			 Each	vial	will	contain	1	x	106	TLPLDC	and	will	be 	labeled	with	the	patient’s	
unique	study	number.		Vaccine	production	and	QA	testing	for	vaccine	release	and	
shipping	will	take	approximately	 three	 weeks. 		Excess	tumor	will	be	maintained	for	
each	patient	in	a	tissue	repository.		 	
This	tissue	may	be	used	in	later	research	to	assess	new	generations	of	vaccines	or	to	re-create	vaccine	for	the	patient	if	necessary.	
The	frozen	 autologous	TLPLDC	 vaccine	 will	be	se nt	back	to	the	site	with	a	total	of	6	
single	dose	vials	 for	intradermal	injections.		 The	vaccination	series	must	be	initiated	
within	 4	 weeks	 of	 receipt	 of	 the	 vaccination	 series	 at	 the	 site .	The	 primary	
vaccination	 series	 will	 include	 4	 monthly	 inoculations	 at	 0,	 1,	 2,	 and	 3	 months	
followed	 by	 boosters	 at	 6	 and	 9	 months	 in	 the	 same	 lymph	 node	 draining	 area	
(preferably	the	 anterior	thigh).		 	
Safety	 data	 will	 be	 collected	 on	 local	 and	 systemic	 toxicities,	 graded	 and	 reported	
per	 the	 NCI	 Common	 Terminology	 Criteria	 for	 Adverse	 Events	 (CTCAE)	 v4.03	
(Appendix	C).	
Patients	will	follow -up	at	their	respective	sites	for	evaluation	of	metastatic	disease	
per	NCCN	guidelines
2.	They	will	undergo	 imaging,	 with	the	same	modality	used	for	
baseline	 measurements,	 to	 meet	 Response	 Evaluation	 Criteria	 in	 Solid	 Tumors	
(RECIST)	 criteria15	to	 monitor	 disease	 approximately	 every	 3	 months	 for	 1	 year.	
Time	to	 the	best	overall	response	will	be	from	the	date	of	 first	inoculation	until	the	
first	 day	 that	 the	 tumor	 meets	 RECI ST	 criteria	 for	 a	 particular	 tumor	 response	
(Appendix	B).		Additionally,	iRECIST	criteria	will	be	applied	(Appendix	B).	In	addition	t o	the	initial	blood	collection 	(70-120	mL)	 for	vaccine	preparation,	 50	
mL	of	blood 	will	be	collected	from	all	patients	prior	to	each	 of	the	six	 inoculations	
and	at	 12	months	from	enrollment	for	a	total	of	 seven 	time	points	or	a	total	of	 420	 -	
470	 mL	 of	 blood	 over	 one	 year.	 	 The	 collected	 blood	 will	 be	 sent	 to	 our	 central	
facility	for	im munologic	testing	of	the	T-cell	response.		The	immunologic	responses	
will	be	correlated	with 	the	clinical	outcomes.	
4.2	 Rationale	for	 Study	 Design 	
Individually,	 CPI 	have	 been	 approved	 for	 use	 in	 metastatic	 melanoma	 and	 the	
TLPLDC	 vaccine	 appears	to	provide 	benefit	to	these	patients	as	well	in	small	studies.		
By	 stimulating	 the	 immune	 system	 to	 develop	 tumor-reactive	 T 	cells	 while	
simultaneously	 preventing	 down-regulation	 of	 th ese	 T	 cells	 in	 the	 tumor	
microenvironment	could	result	in	a	highly	effective	multimodality	immunotherapy	
that	 could	 significantly	 impact	 clinical	 outcomes	 of	 patients	 with	 metastatic	
melanoma.	 	 While	 CPI	 have	 been	 proven	 to	 be	 effective	 in	 metastatic	 melanoma	
patients	in	terms	of	tumor	response	as	well	as	survival,	the	majority	of	metas tatic	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 16	melanoma	 patients	 still	 succumb	 to	 their	 disease.	 	 In	 response	 to	 CPI	 treatment,	
metastatic	 melanoma	 lesions	 may	 show	 no	 response	 (de	 novo	 PD),	 an	 initial	
response	followed	by	progressive	disease	(delayed	PD),	or	may	stabilize	but	persist	
(SD).		In	a ll	of	these	situations,	the	CPI	monotherapy	is	not	sufficient	alone.		
	One	theory	is	that	these	patients	lack	 adequate	numbers	of	tumor -reactive	T	cells	
on	which	the	CPI	can	work.		The	TLPLDC	vaccine	generates	tumor-reactive	T	cells	as	
its	primary	mechanism	of	action.			
	
In	 order	 to	 assess	 both	 the	 safety	 as	 well	 as	 the	 efficacy	 of	 adding	 the	 TLPLDC	vaccine	to	SoC	CPI	 therapy	 in	metastatic	melanoma	patients,	up	to	 45	patients	will	
be	enrolled	 over	approximately	one	year	at	4 -8	sites	 into	this	study.	 	This	 number	
will	 allow	 an	 overall	 assess ment	 of	 the	 safety	 and	 potential	 efficacy	 of	 this	 novel	
combination	 treatment	 regimen	 compared	 to	 the	 currently	 known	 and	 accepted	
rates	of	response	to	CPI	monotherapy	in	these	patients.			
	
4.3	 Outcome	Measures	
4.3.1	 Primary	outcome	measures	
Standard	 local	 and	 systemic	 toxicities	 will	 be	 collected	 and	 graded	 per	 the	 NCI	
CTCAE	 v4.03	 graded	 toxicity	 scale	 (Appendix	 C).	 	 For	 both	 the	 primary	 vaccine	
series	 and	 the	 booster	 inoculations,	 patients	 will	 be	 monitored	 closely	 for	 30	
minutes	 after	 each 	inoculation	 with	 questioning,	 serial	 exams	 and	 vital	 signs	 as	
needed 	to	observe	for	a	hypersensitivity	reactio n.		Local	or	systemic	toxicities	will	
be	collected	and	graded	by	the	research	staff	at	the	patient’s	next	visit.	Serious	AEs 	
will	be	reported	as	described	in	Section	6.0. 	
	Evidence	of	 tumor	response	to	the	proposed	treatment	regimen	 will	be	determined	
by	the	 primary	investigator	 at	the	individual	study	sites	during	their	routine	follow -
up	screening 	and	assessed	by	the	Guideline s	for	the	Evaluation	of	Immune	Therapy	
Activity	 in	 Solid	 tumors	 criteria	 (iRECIST) 	in	 addition	 to	 the	 Response	 Evaluation	
Criteria	 in	 Solid	 Tumors	 (RECIST)	 criteria	 (Appendix	 B).		This	 will	 oc cur	 for	 all	
enrolled	 patients,	 approximately	 every	 three 	months	 for	1	 year.	 Follow -up	 will	
include	 history,	 full	 dermatologic	 clinical	 exam,	 laboratory	 and	 radiogr aphic	
surveillance	per	NCCN	guidelines.		Surveillance	imaging	should	be	conducted	with	the	 same	 modality	 as	 used	 for	 baseline	 imaging.	 	 If	 patients	 develop	 contra-
indications	to	certain	modalities	during	the	trial,	their	cases	must	be	discussed	with	a	radiologist	to	determine	the	best	alternative	imaging	study	to	used,	otherwise	they	
must	be	deemed	‘not	evaluable’	from	that	time	period.	 		If	records	are	not	av ailable,	
patients,	 or	 their	 referring	 physicians,	 will	 be	 contacted	 to 	discern	 their	 disease	
status.		 	
	
The	 primary	 outcome	 for	 this	 trial	 includes	 safety	 of	 the 	TLPLDC 	vaccine	 used	 in	
conjunction	with	CPI	in	addition	to	overall 	tumor	response	to	this	treatment	plan.		
While	 the	 safety	 and	 tumor	 response	 in	 individual	 patients	 will	 be	 assessed	
continuously,	 the	 assessment	 of	 the	 primary	 endpoints 	will	 be	 determined	 and	
analyzed	 12	months	after 	the	last	patient	is	enrolled 	into	this	trial.		
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 17		
An	interim	analysis	will	be	performed	12	months	after	the	initiation	of	this	trial	 for	
both	safety	and	tumor	response	trends.		No	action	regarding	stopping	the	trial	will	
be	taken	based	on	this	analysis	unless	there	is	a	safety	concern .			It	is	a nticipated	
that	 all	 patients	 will	 have	 been	 enrolled	 with	 approximately	 6	 months	 of	 median	
follow-up	at	this	interim	analysis.			
4.3.2 	Secondary	 outcome	measures 	
	
The	 secondary	 outcome	 measures	 for	 this	 trial	 will	 compare	 treatment	 to	 the	
currently 	known	 rates	 of	 AEs	 and	 ORR	 of	 CPI	 monotherapy.	 These	 assessments	
would	be	completed	at	both	the	interim	and	final	analys es.		
	4.3.3	 Exploratory 	outcome	measures	
Immune	responses	will	be	primarily	documented	using	 CTL	assays	on	stored	blood	
and	assessment	of	stored	serum	pre -	and	post -vaccination.		 Detailed	descriptions	of	
these	assays/tests	are	described	in	Section s	5.3.5	and	5.3.6.				
	
Phenotypic	 assays	 (dimer/tetramer)	 for	 clonal	 CTL	 expansion	 against	 common	
melanoma-associated	 antigens	 such	 as	 gp -100	 and	 MART-1	 as	 well	 as	 functional	
assays	like	 ELISPOT	against	the	same	antigens	will	 be	performed	on	banked/stored	
blood. 		Antibody	and	cytokine	responses	may	be	assessed	on	the	stored	serum.			
	
Blood/serum	 will	be	collected	prior	to	each	inoculation	 and	at	study	completion	at	
12	months	 from	 enrollment.		Comparisons	will	be	made	between	the	immunologic	
responses	within	and	between	each	treatment	group.			
	In	a	series	of	explora tory	analyses,	the	results	of	th ese	immunologic	measures	will	
be	correlated	with	clinical	outcome	within	and	between	each	treatment	group.		
4.4			 Safety	 Considerations	
In	our	 previous	 trials ,	 the	 safety	 of	 the	 autologous	 tumor/D C	 vaccines	 has	 been	
excellent.	 According	 to	 the	 preclinical	 trial,	mice	 behavior 	was	 observed 	for	
evidence	 of	 possible	 toxicities.	 	 No	 abnormalities	 were	 appreciated	 within	 the	
vaccination	group,	nor	were	there	differences	be tween	the	vaccinated	or	controls
23.			
In	the	completed	 melanoma	 phase	I/IIa	 in	stage	IV	mel anoma	patients,	 where	the	
autologous	 tumor/DC	 dendritoma	 vaccine	 was	 given	 with	 IL -2,	the	 most	 common	
adverse	events	experienced	by	patients	included	fever	( 60%),	chills	(32 %),	nausea	
(28%),	 arthralgias/myalgias	 (28%),	 erythema	 (20%),	 headache	 (16%),	 anemia	
(16%),	 hypotension	 (16%),	 weight	 gain	 (12%),	 stomatitis	 (12%),	 edema	 (12%),	rash	 (12%),	 pain	 (12%),	 and	 fatigue	 (12%).		There	 were	 a	 total	 of	 four	 severe	
adverse	 reactions,	 which	 occurred	 in	 this	 trial,	 although	 they	 were	 deemed	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 18	unrelated	to	the	dendrito ma	vaccine.	 Many	of	these	toxicities	were 	attributable	to	
IL-2,	which	 will	 not	 be	 used	 in	 the	 current	 study24.		In	 the	 phase	 I/IIa	 trial	 of	 the	
TLPLDC	vaccine,	there	were	only	mild	toxicities	(grade	<2)	in	20%	of	the	patients.	 		
Previous	trials	evaluating	the	toxicity	associated	with	CPI	have	resulted	in	various	
immune	related	adverse	events.	The	most	common	toxicities	included	 fatigue,	rash,	
diarrhea,	 and	 pruritus11.	 	 Additional	 toxicities	 have	 been	 associated	 with	 specific	
CPIs	 at	varying	rates17.	Ipilimumab	is	ch aracterized	by	 an	overall	 72.3%	occurrence	
of	 immune-related	 AE.	 Grade	 3	 or	 4	 irAEs	 were	 observed	 in	 25.2%	 of	 patients,	
affecting	 the	 GI	 tract	 (12%),	 liver	 (7%),	 skin	 (3%),	 and	 endocrine	 system	 (3%).		These	AE	are	noted	 to	occur	at	predictable	times	based	on	duration	of	treatment	 –	
skin	 related	 events	 within	 the	 first	 3	 weeks,	 GI/hepatic	 AE	 after	 6 -7	 weeks	 of	
treatment,	and	endocrinopathies	after	9	weeks	of	treatment.		AE	also	varies	based	
on	dosing,	with	approximately	7%	 of	Grade	3	and	4	toxicities	occurring	at	the	FDA	
approved	3mg/kg	dose
17.		Similarly,	 pembrolizumab	had	an	overall	AE	rate	between	
72.9	 –	79%	based	on	dosing;	10mg/kg	every	2	or	3	weeks.		This	CPI	 is	noted	to	a	
have	a	lower 	AE	profile	 compared	to	 ipilimumab,	 13.3%	versus	 19.9%	 respectively.		
Grade	 3	 and	 4	 toxicities	 included	 colitis	 and	 hepatitis	 within	 1 -	2.5%	 of	 treated	
patients11.		
In	 this	 trial,	 all	 patients	 will	 continue	 their	 treatment	 with	 CPI	 o f	 choice	 by	 the	
primary	 investigator/study	 site.	 There	 are 	inherently	 known 	toxicities 	associated	
with	each	CPI ,	and	thus	baseline	 toxicities	associated	with	these 	medications	will	be	
assessed	prior	to	the	initiation	of	the	vaccines.		We	anticipate	similar	local	responses	
as	see n	in	our	prior	phase	I/IIa	trials	utilizing	the	TLPLDC	vaccines. 	We	anticipate	a	
similar	 favorable	 safety	 profile	 for	 the	 vaccine	 in	 this	 trial ;	 however,	 meticulous	
documentation	will	be	performed	 on	the	impact	of	the	vaccine	on	baseline	toxicities	
associated	with	the	CPI .		
Patients	will	be	monitored	after	each	inoculation,	and	 local	and	systemic	toxicities	
will	 be	 documented,	 graded	 by	 the	 NCI	 CTCAE	 v4.03	 and	 reported	 as	 indicated	
below	in	 Section	6.0.	
Additionally,	there	is	a	small	risk	associated	with	the	protocol-dictated	 single	dose	
of	Neupogen	prior	to	the	initial	blood	draw	for	DC	isolation.		Neupogen	is	a	FDA -
approved	drug	for	increasing	the	white	blood	count,	is	commonly	used	in	oncology	patients,	and	has	a	well -tolerated	toxicity	profile. 	
4.5			 Compliance	with	 Laws	and	Regulations	
This	study	will	be	conducted	in	accordance	with	current	FDA	Good	Clinical	Practices	(GCPs),	and	local	ethical	and	legal	requirements.	
5.0			 MATERIALS	AND	METHODS 	
5.1	 Subjects	
Up	to	45	p atients	over	the	age	of	18	years	with	a	diagnosis	 metastatic 	melanoma,	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 19	with	 evidence	 of	 measurable	 disease,	 and	 eligible	 for	 (or	 being	 treated	 with)	 CPI	
therapy	 may	 be	 included.		Patients	 should	 have	 completed	 biochemotherapy	 or	
targeted	therapy 	per	standard	of	care	as	indicated. 	Each	patient	must	 be	currently	
eligible	for	(or	being	 treated	with )	a	FDA-approved	CPI .	Patients	will	be	recruited	
from	 medical	 and	 surgical	 oncology	 and/or	 hematology/oncology	 clinics	 at	 the	
individual	study	sites.			All	patients	will	be	properly	counseled	and	consented. 	
5.1.1	Subject	selection	
Potentially	 eligible	 patients	 will	 be	 identified	 by	 staff	 in	 the	 medical	 and	 surgical	
and/or	the	hematology/oncology	clinics	at	the	individual	study	sites.			
A	research	nurse	and/or	study	coordinator	will	approach	these	patients	about	b eing	
in	the	trial	and	will	introduce	the	trial	to	the	prospective	volunteer.		If	the	volunteer	
is	interested	and	appears	eligible,	the	nurse	will	arrange	to	counsel	the	patient.		The	
nurse	 will	 thoroughly	 screen	 the	 patient	 for	 inclusion	 and	 exclusion	 elig ibility	
criteria.	 	 If	 the	 patient	 remains	 interested	 and	 eligible,	 the	 research	 nurse	
coordinator	and/or	study	coordinator,	or	Principal	Investigator	(PI),	will	explain	the	
study	and	review	the	consent	form	with	the	patient.		Prospective	participants	will	be	
provided	a	copy	of	the	consent	form	to	read	and	given	ample	time	to	ask	and	have	all	questions	answered	prior	to	signing	the	consent	form.			After	all	questions	have	
been	answered,	and	the	patient	wishes	to	participate	in	the	trial,	they	will	sign	the	
consent 	form	to	undergo	tissue	procurement	(consent#1).			
Tumor	 procurement	 may	 be	 completed	 using	 core	 needle	 biopsy	 or	 excisional	biopsy,	depending	on	 the	location	of	the	tumor.		
After	 tissue	procurement	 (which	need	not	occur	at	the	study	site) ,	if	sufficient 	tumor	
is	 available	 for	 vaccine	 production 	(1	 cm
3	preferred,	 1mg	 minimum)	 (minimum	 3	
passes	with	core	needle),	and	 the	patient	is	able	to	continue	 treatment	with	a	 CPI,	
they	will	then	be	consented	for	participation	in	the	clinical	trial 	(consent#2).	 	Blood	
will	be	obtained	from	the	patient	per	below.			
The	 patient	 will	 receive	 a	 single	 injection	 of	 Neupogen	 (G -CSF)	 300	 µg	
subcutaneously	 24 -48	hours	 prior	 to	 having	 70	mL	of	blood	collected	and	sent	to	
our	central	facility	for	DC	isolation	and	preparation .		Patients	who	 cannot 	tolerate	
Neupogen	or	refuse	it,	will	have	120	mL	of	blood	drawn	and	sent .	Additional	blood	
may	be	drawn	if	additional	vaccine	doses	need	to	be	made	or	remade	for	any	reason.		The	full	course	(six	doses)	of	the	 TLPLDC	vaccine	w ill	be	 produced	at	one	time	after	
tumor	and	blood	is	received	at	the	central	laboratory	facilit y.		The	production	and	
QA	testing	for	vaccine	release	will	take	approximately	 three	 weeks	 at	which	point	
the	entire	vaccine	series	and	boosters	will	be	shipped	back	to	 the	site	for	storage	
until	use.		 Frozen	 tumor,	serum	and	blood 	will	be	maintained	on	all	patients 	under	
their	unique	study	number	 for	re-creation	of	the	vaccine	as	needed .		Vaccinations	
must	begin	within	4	weeks	after	 vaccine	is	received	at	the	site.

5.2	 Study	 Treatment	
5.2.1	 Vaccine	production		
Vaccines	will	be	produced	by	Orbis	Health	Solutions	(Greenville,	SC).		 Tumor	lysate	
from	 the	patient ’s	tumor	 is	 loaded	 into	 YCWP	 which	 are	 phagocytized	 by	 the	
patient ’s	dendritic	cells	in	vitro	 to	generate	TLPLDC.		 	
The	 final	 vaccine	 contains	 1x106	TLPLDC	 per	 dose	 and	 will	 be	 provided	 in	 frozen	
single	 dose	 vials	 in	 250 	µl	 of	 freezing	 media.	 	 The	 final	 vaccine	 is	 prepared	 for	
injection	by	thawing	the	single	dose	vial	and	 diluting	the	TLPLDC	by	adding	500	 µl	
of	sterile	saline	for	injection.	
5.2.1.1	 Preparation	of	dendritic	cells	
Dendritic	 cells	 will	 be	 generated	 from	 the	 patient's	 peripheral	 blood	 monocytes 	
(PBMC) 	obtained	 from	 the	 post-Neupogen	 70	 mL	 blood	 draw	 or	 from	 120	 mL	 of	
blood	drawn	if	Neupogen	not	used.		The	 PBMCs	 are	initially	diluted	and	placed	in	a	
plastic	culture	flask	for	2	h ours.		Non -adherent	cells	are	washed	away	and	collected.		
These	cells	are	rich	in	lymphocytes	and	will	be	frozen	for	future	assays.			
The	adherent	cells	 will	be	incubated	at	37°C	in	5%	CO 2	for	two	days	in	serum-free	
cell	 culture	 medium	 with	 the	 appropriate	 cytokines	 added	 to	 generate	 immature	
monocyte-derived	dendritic	cells.	
5.2.1.2	 Tumor	tissue	preparation	
A	minimum	of	 1	mg	 sample	of	viable	tumor	tissue	is	required	to	be	collected	 and	
verified	 prior	to	consent #2	for	study	participation .		The	specimens	will	be	collected	
and	 placed	 in	 sterile	 freezing	 vials	 that	 will	 be	 provided	 and	 then	 shipped	 in	
specialized	FedEx	shippers	d esigned	to	keep	the	specimens	frozen	(also	provided).		
The	 cells	 of	 the	 tumor	 tissue	 will	 be	 lysed	 by	 multiple	 freeze/thaw	 cycles	 in	 lysis	
buffer	 to	produce	tumor	lysate.	
5.2.1.3	YCWP	preparation	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 22	YCWP	 are	 prepared	 by	 NaOH	 digestion	 of	 all	 non -cell	 wall	 material	 from	
Fleishman’s	 Bakers ’	yeast,	 Saccharomyces	 cerevisiae,	 followed	 by	 thorough	
aqueous,	ethanol ,	and	acetone	washings. 	
5.2.1.4	Loading	of	YCWP	with	tumor	lysate	
TLPLDC	are	generated	by	incubating	tumor	lysate	loaded	YCWP	in	the	presence	of	
dendritic	 cells	 at	 a	 specific	 time	 during	 day	 2	 of	 the	 DC	
isolation/ incubation/maturation	 process.		The	 timing	 is	 essential	 in	 that	 the	
immature	DC	are	given	the	YCWP	at	their	most	phagocytic	phase.			
5.2.2	 Storage	
Six	 doses	 of	 1	 x	 106	autologous	 TLPLDC	 will	 be	 cryopreserved	 in	 patient-specific	
labeled	single	dose	vials	and	maintained	at	the	central	production	facility	at	 -80◦C	
until	 shipped.	 	 Once	 approved	 for	 release,	 the	 entire	 vaccine	 series	 (all	 six	 doses)	
will	 be	 shipped	 to	 the	 site	 frozen	 in	 specialized	 LN	shippers.	 	 The	 patient-specific	
dose	series	 will	be	stored	at	the	site	at 	least	 -70°C	in	the	research	pharmacy	until	
serially	thawed	for	use.		 	
5.2.3	 Inoculation	series	–	administration	
Patients	will	 receive	six 	intradermal	inoculations	on	the	anterior	or	medial	side	of	
the	same	thigh	 or	arm .	The	general	area	of	inoculation	will	be	at	a	location	midway	
between	the	inguinal	ligament	and	the	knee.	
Before	injection,	this	cellular	vaccine	will	 either	 be	thawed	 slowly	 in	a	370	C	water	
bath 	or	the	vaccine	vial	can	be	held	in	a	gloved	hand	until	thawed	if	water	bath	is	not	
available.	The	vial	should	not	be	left	lying	out	to	thaw	at	ambient	temperature.	 The	
250	 µl	of	thawed	TLPLDC	will	be	diluted	with	500	 µl	of	sterile	saline	for	injection.		
The	final	750	 µl	volume	will	be	d rawn	up	into	a	1	mL	syringe	 and	should	be	injected	
within	4	hours .			
The	 entire	 contents	 of	 the	 s yringe	 will	 be	 injected	 intradermally	 in	 two	
approximately	 equal	inoculums	at	 two	differen t	sites	5	cm	from	each	other	 on	the	
anterior	 or	 medial	 thigh	 or	 arm.	 Inoculations	 will	 be	 administered	 in	 the	 same	
lymph	node	draining	area	(same	arm	or	leg)(see	also	Appendix	D).			
The	 research	 nurse	 coordinator	 will	 administer	 the	 inoculations	 sterilel y	in	 the	
clinic	 facility	 located	 at	 each	 study	 site.	 For	 female	 patients	 with	 childbearing	
potential,	a	urine	pregnancy	test	will	be	performed	before	each	inoculation.	If	this	
test	is	positive	at	any	time,	the	patient	will	be	discontinued	from	the	study.	
Initial	inocul ations	will	be	performed	at	0,	1,	2	and	3	 months	 +	1	week 	followed	by	
booster	inoculations	at	6	and	9	months 	+	2	weeks	 from	 initial	inoculation 	for	a	total	
of	six	doses.		
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 23	5.3	 Study	 Assessments	
Signed,	 IRB -approved	 informed	 consents	 must	 be	 obtained	 from	 patients	 prior	 to	
any	pretreatment	assessments.			
5.3.1	 Pretreatment	assessments	
This	trial	requires	 two	 consents;	the	first	 for	tumor	tissue	procurement,	 and	a	second	
for	blood	draw	and	treatment.		The	consent s	will	be	 signed	once	 the	patient	has	been	
adequately	 and	 appropriately	 counseled	 and	 all	 eligibility	 criteria	 are	 met.	 	 The	
second	consent	will	be	signed	once	adequate	tissue	is	received	f or	vaccine	 production .	
	
All	patients	must	have	a	CBC ,	CMP,	and	LDH 	within	 4	weeks	 of	trial	 initiation	 and,	for	
female	 patients,	 a	 urine	 pregnancy	 test	 (upon	 consent	 to	 study),	 for	 screening	 and	
immediately	 prior	 to	 any	 vaccine	 inoculations.		 If	 the	 pregnancy	 test	 is	 positive	 the	
patient	 will	 be	 excluded	 from	 the	 study.	 	 Women	 who	 have	 had	 a	 hy sterectomy,	
bilateral	ooph orectomy,	tubal	ligation,	documented	absence	of	menses	for	two	years,	
or	 FSH	 hormonal	 laboratory	 results	 that	 verify	 menopause,	 will	 not	 be	 required	 to	
have	pregnancy	testing.		 	
All	 patients	 must	 have	 a	 complete	 metastatic	 evaluation	 within	 4	 weeks	 of	 vaccine	
initiation	as	a	baseline	evaluation. 		Overall	health	screen	will	be	assessed	utilizing	the	
ECOG	performance	status	grading	system	(Appendix	A).	
All	 patients	 will	be	 assessed	 for	 baseline 	and	 post-vaccination	 immunologic	
responses.		 Blood	samples	will	be	obtained	prior 	to	each	inoculation	(0,	1,	2,	3,	6 ,	
and	9	 months)	and	at	study	completion	 at	12	months	from	enrollment.	 The	protocol	
schedule	 of	 events	 is	 listed	 in	 Appendix	 E.	 		Specimen	 handling,	 processing,	 and	
assays	are	described	in	Sections	 5.3.4,	5.3 .5,	and	5 .3.6.	
5.3.2	 Assessments	during	treatment	
Any	laboratory	evaluations	or	imaging	studies	ordered	by	the	treating	oncologist	as	
part	 of	 standard	 practice	 will	 be	 reviewed	 by	 the	 research	 nurses	 or	 study	
coordinators	and	any	abnormal	results	will	be	reviewed	by	the	study	investigators.	
For	both	the	 primary	 inoculations	 and	booster	series,	the	patients	will	be	monitored	
closely	 for	 30	 minutes	 after	 inoculation	 with	 questioning,	 serial	 exams,	 and	 vital	
signs	 as	 needed 	to	 observe	 for	 a	 hypersensitivity	 reaction.	 	 	Local	 or	 systemic	
toxicities	will	be	collected	and	graded	by	the	research	staff	at	the	patient’s	next	visit. 	
The	NCI	CTCAE	v4.0 3	graded	toxicity	scale	( Appendix	C )	will	be	utilized	to 	assess	
local	and	systemic	toxicity.			Blood	 samples	 will	 be	 obtained	 from	 all	 patients	 to	 determine	 induction	 of	
anticancer	immune	responses	as	described	in	Sections	5.3 .4,	5.3 .5,	and	5 .3.6.	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 24	5.3.3	 Follow -up	assessments	
The	clinical	endpoint	of	 objective	 tumor	response	as	defined	as	progressive	disease	
(PD),	stable	dise ase	(SD),	partial	response	(PR) ,	and	complete	response	(CR) 	will	be	
determined	by	 the	primary	investigator	 at	the	individual	study	sites 	during	routine	
follow-up.		This	will	include	 history	and	 physical	examination	every	3	months	for	all	
patients 	for	1	year .			
Additional	 laboratory	and	radiographic	surveillance	 will	be	performed 	as	indicated 	
and	 directed	 by	 the	 patients	 treating	 physicians 	and	 per	 standard	 of	 care .	 	The	
determination	 of	CR,	PR,	SD,	or	PD	 will	be	 assessed	 per	RECIST	criteria 	and	iRECIST 	
(Appendix	 B).	 	 These	 results	 will 	be	communicated	 by	the	 primary	 study	
investigators	on	a	rout ine	basis.		 	
For	 the	 purposes	 of	 this	 trial,	 the	 timing	 associated	 with	 tumor	 response	 will	 be	
calculated	from	the	date	of	 initial	inoculation 	to	the	first	date	that	the	tumor	me ets	
RECIST	criteria	 and	iRECIST	criteria .			If	records	are	not	available,	patients,	or	their	
referring	 physicians,	 will	 be	 contacted	 to	 discern	 their	 disease	 status	 and	 every	
effort	will	be	made	to	obtain	documentation.			
All	enrolled	patients	will	be	followed	for	1	year	after	enrollment.	5.3.4		 Blood	collection	and	processing 	
Multiple	blood	draws	will	be	required	for	this	trial.	All	blood	tubes	will	be	labeled	
only	with	the	patients’	unique	study	number.		Approximately	 50	mL	will	be	collected	
for	immunologic	assessments	prior	to	each	inoculation	(0,	1,	2,	 3,	6,	and	 9	months)	
and	at	the	final	study	visit.	 				
Thus,	 including	the	initial	blood	draw 	for	vaccine	production	(70 -120	mL),	 a	total	of	
approximately	 420-470	 mL	of	blood	will	be	drawn	over	the 	one-year	 course	of	the	
study.	 	 De-identified	 patient	 blood	 samples	 showing	 only	 the	 unique	 study	 ID	
number	 will	be	 sent	from	study	sites	via	overnight	delivery	to	 our	central	lab	facility	
in	 Greenville,	 SC	 where	 they	 will	 be	 stored	 until	 used	 for	 immunologic	 assays	
(Section	 5.4 .6).	 	 At	 no	 point	 will	 laboratory 	personnel	 have	 access	 to	 patient	
identifiers.		 Blood	 will	be	frozen	and	stored	 under	unique	study	numbers	 for	up	to	
five	 years	 for	 additional	 immunologic	 studies	 related	 to	 this	 protocol	 or	 for	
additional	 stu dies	 for	 melanoma	 treatment	 (for	 example,	 to	 repeat	 assays	 or	
perform	 new	 immunologic	 assays	 that	 do	 not	 exist	 at	 present	 but	 may	 become	available)	as	needed	and	then	destroyed.		 No	genetic	testing	will	be	performed	on	
this	material.		 Study	participants	will	not	be	contacted	in	the	future	for	additional	
use	 of	 these	 stored	 blood	 specimens.	 	 If	 study	 participants	 want	 their	 blood	specimens	removed	from	storage	and	destroyed,	they	may	do	so	by	contacting	the	
PI	or	research	nurse	at	any	time.		Additionally,	any	stored	blood	may	also	be	utilized	
to	assess	new	generations	of	vaccines.					 	
The	50	mL	of	blood	will	be	collected	as	 follows: 	10	mL	 into	a	BD	Vacu tainer	Rapid	
Serum	 tube	 (BD,	 Franklin	 Lakes,	 NJ)	 which	 contain	 a	 clot	 activator	 and	 silicone	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 25	coated 	interior.	 After	 receipt	and	 centrifugation,	serum	will	be	collected,	aliquoted	
in	vials	and	frozen.	 The	remaining	 40	mL	will	be	 collected	into	 four	 BD	Vacutainer	
Heparin	tubes	(green	tops)	 which	contain	an	anticoagulant	(sodium	heparin).		Once	
received,	 t he	 heparinized	 blood	 will	 be	 pooled,	 diluted,	 and	 added	 to	 FICOLL	
HYPAQUE	 density	 gradient	 fluid	 containing	 tubes	 to	 allow	 for	 the	 separation	 of	
PBMC	from	the	red	blood	cells	by	a	single	step	centrifugation	process.			
The	 PBMC	 fraction	 will	 be	 collected ,	 aliquot ted,	 and	 frozen	 for	 future	 use	 in	
immunologic	assays.	
5.3.5		 Phenotypic	 assay	 (for	 example,	 dextramer	 assay)	 for	 melanoma-specific	
antigens	 	
Thawed	and	cultured 	PBMC	will	be	stained	with	aqua	live/dead	stain	(Invitrogen)	
and	 the	 following	 antibodies:	 	 CD8	 APC-H7	 (BD	 Biosciences),	 CD3	 PE	 Cy7	 (BD	
Biosciences),	 gp100 -APC -conjugated	 dextramer	 (Immudex),	 and	 the	 following	
pacific	 blue	 conjugated	 lineage	 antibodies:	 	 C D14	 (BD	 Biosciences),	 CD16	 (BD	
Biosciences),	 and	 CD19	 (Biolegend).	 	 Cells	 will	 be	 analyzed	 on	 a	 Canto	 flow	
cytometer	(BD	Biosciences).			
The	frequency	of	 gp100 -specific	CD8+	T-cells	will	be	determined	as	the	percentage	
of	cells	that	are	alive,	lineage -,	CD3+	CD8+	and	 gp100 -dextramer+.		This	assay	may	
be	 performed	 for	 other	 known	 CD8+	epitopes	 from	 known	 melanoma-specific	
antigens. 		
5.3.6		 Functional	assay	(for	example,	ELISPOT	assay)	for	melanoma-specific	antigens	
Thawed	and	 isolated	PBMC	are	 cultured/stimulated	overnight	in	complete	medium	
(RPMI	 +	 5	 %FCS	 +	 PSG)	 supplemented	 with	 IL-7	 (20	 ng/mL)	 with	 the	 individual	
peptides	at	25	μg/mL	(gp100,	MART-1,	etc)	or	PMA	+	Ionomycin	in	flat-bottom	anti-
human	 IFN-γ	 ELISPOT	 plates	 (BD	 PharMingen)	 at	 5	 x	 105	 cells/well/200	 μL	 in	
duplicate	wells.		The	plate	is	incubated	at	37ºC	overnight	after	which	the	wells	will	be	washed	and	incubated	with	the	biotinylated -anti -IFN-γ	mAb	for	two	hours.		The	
wells	will	be	washed	again	and	incubated	with	streptavidin -conju gated	HRP	for	one	
hour.		After	a	final	wash	the	AEC-substrate	solution	will	be	added	to	the	wells	and	allowed	to	develop	for	approximately	5 -10	minutes	at	which	time	the	wells	will	be	
washed	with	deionized	water	to	stop	the	reaction.		The	number	of	spots	p resent	in	
each	well	will	be	enumerated	using	the	CTL	ELISPOT	analyzer	(CTL	Analyzers	LLC,	Cleveland,	OH). 	
5.4	 Discontinuation	of	Protocol-Specific	 Therapy 	
Protocol -specific	therapy	may	be	discontinued	for	any	of	the	following	reasons:				
• Progressive	diseas e	
• Unacceptable	toxicity	as	described	in	the	protocol :		
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 26	o Please	 refer	 to	 Section	 4.4	 (Safety	 Considerations ).	 	Adverse	 events	
that	do	not	respond	to	clinical	management	of	the	reaction	will	result	
in	discontinuation	from	the	study.	
o Please	refer	to	Section	 5.5	(Subject	Discontinuation)	for	a	list	of	severe	
adverse	reactions	warranting	discontinuation	from	the	study.		
• Patient	election	to	discontinue	therapy	(for	any	reason) 	
• Physician’s	judgment	
5.5	 Subject	Discontinuation 	
Those	 patients	 who	 display	 significant	 reactions	 (i.e.	 anaphylactic	 reaction	
immediately	after	vaccine	administration)	or	 serious	 toxicities	will	be	discontinued	
from	 the	 study	 as	 discussed	 below	 and	 as	 determined	 by	 the	 PI	 and/or	 Sponsor.		
They	will	be	followed	by	the	study	investigator	until	resolution	of	the	adverse	event .	
Inoculations	 will	 be	 immediately	 halted	 if	 any	 serious	 adverse	 reactions	 occur	 to	
include:	 death,	 life -threatening	 adverse	 drug	 experience	 (i.e.,	 severe	 anaphylactic	
reaction	 immediately	 after	 vaccine	 administration),	 inpatient	 hospitalization	 or	prolongation	 of	 existing	 hospitalization,	 a	 persistent	 or	 significant	
disability/incapacity,	a	congenital	anomaly/birth	defect,	or	other	important	medical	
events	 that	 may	 not	 result	 in	 death,	 be	 life-threatening,	 or	 require	 hospitalization	but	 which,	 when	 based	 upon	 appropriate	 judgment	 of	 the	 PI,	 be	 determined	 to	
jeopardize	 the	 patient	 or	 require	 medical	 or	 surgical	 intervention	 to	 prevent	 an	
outcome	listed	above.			
Any	 death	 or	 grade	 4	 adverse	 drug	 experience	 found	 to	 be	 directly	 related	 to	 the	
experimental	vaccine	will	result	in	suspension	of	patient	enrollment	to	the	study.	
In	the	event	a	patient	develops	a	severe	adverse	reaction	to	the	CPI	that	is	unable	to	
be	managed	with	immunosuppressive	medications	may	also	be	discontinued	from	
the	study. 	
Patients	may	withdraw	from	the	study	at	any	time	and	for	any	reason.		A	patient	
may	be	asked	to	withdraw	from	the	study	by	the	PI	if	they	are	not	compliant	with	
the	timing	of	 the	inoculation	series,	observation	period,	or	return	visits	to	monitor	
for	study -associated	toxicities.		 	
Additionally,	if	the	PI	determines	that	it	is	no	longer	safe	for	a	patient	to	continue	in	the	trial	for	any	reason,	they	may	be	withdrawn.			
Because	 it	 is	 not	 known	 whether	 these	 inoculations	 might	 harm	 an	 unborn	 child,	
patients	who	are	pregnant,	plan	on	becoming	pregnant,	or	who	are	breast-feeding	
will	 not	 be	 enrolled	 into	 the	 study.	 	 Women	 of	 childbearing	 potential 	will	 take	 a	
urine	 pregnancy	 test	 before	 starting	 this	 study	 and	 prior	 to	 each	 inoculation;	 a	positive	test	result	will	terminate	the	patient’s	participation	in	the	study.		 Patients	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 27	will	be	counseled	to	avoid	becoming	pregnant	while	participating	in	this	study,	and	
that	in	order	to	prevent	 pregnancy	they	should	either	have	no	sexual	relations	or	
use	a	reliable	type	of	birth	control.	They	will	be	counseled	that	with	the	exception	of	
hysterectomy,	bilateral	ooph orectomy,	or	tubal	ligation,	birth	control	methods	are	
not	totally	effective	in	pre venting	pregnancy,	and	that	the	only	ways	to	completely	
avoid	the	risk	of	the	vaccine	or	immunoadjuvant	alone	to	an	unborn	baby	are	(1)	
avoid	becoming	pregnant,	or	(2)	do	not	receive	these	inoculations.	Patients	will	be	
counseled	 to	 avoid	 becoming	 pregnant	 for	 at	 least	 six	months	 after	 receiving	 the	
inoculations,	 as	pregnancy	within	this	time	after	inoculation	administration	may	be	
a	risk	to	an	unborn	baby. 			
If	a	patient	is	discontinued	from	the	study	for	an	adverse	event	or	pregnancy,	they	
will	continue	t o	be	followed	for	resolution	of	adverse	event	and	clinical	recurrences	
unless	the	patient	withdraws	consent	for	further	study	evaluation.	 	
The	 reason	 for	 any	 premature	 discontinuation	 of	 a	 patient	 from	 the	 study	 will	 be	
recorded	on	the	appropriate	Case	Rep ort	Form .		
5.6	 Study	 Discontinuation 	
The	IND	sponsor,	 the	Data	Safety	Monitoring	Board,	and	the	 overall	study	 Principal	
Investigator	 have	 the	 right	 to	 suspend	 or	 terminate	 this	 study	 entirely	 or	 at	 a	
specific	 site	 at	 any	 time.	 	 Reasons	 for	 suspending	 or	 terminating	 the	 study	 may	
include	the	following:	
• The	incidence	or	severity	of	 AEs	in	this	or	other	studies	indicates	a	potential	
health	hazard	to	subjects 	
• Subject	enrollment	is	unsatisfactory	
• Data	recording	are	inaccurate	or	incomplete	
• Study	protocol	not	followed 	
5.7	 Data	 Collection	
Basic	demographic,	pathologic,	and	relevant	clinical	information	will	be	gathered	on	each	patient	and	entered	into	an	Electronic	Data	Capture	(EDC)	database.		The	URL	for	the	EDC	system	is	 https://cancerinsight.eclinicalhosting.com/OpenClinica.		The	
EDC	system	can	be	accessed	from	any	major	web	browser.	 User	name	and	password	
will	be	generated	by	 the	Data	Manager	of	Cancer	 Insight,	LLC	 and	sent	via	email	to	
appropriate	site	personnel	prior	to	enrolling	the ir	first	patient.	Clinical	nurses	at	 the	
site	 will	 be	 provided	 with	 Source	 Document	 Flow	 Sheets	 to	 capture	 data	 at	enrollment	and	for	each	study	visit.		Although	some	data	fields	on	th e	Flow	Sheets	
will	 not	 be	 entered	 into	 EDC,	 they	 must	 be	 captured	 on	 the	 Flow	 Sheets	 for	monitoring	purposes.		
All	data	must	be	submitted	within	72	hours	of	the	data	collection	visit.		Data	entry	
will	 begin	 when	 the	 patient	 signs	 the	 second	 informed	 consent,	 with	 enrollment	
date	to	be	date	of	signed	informed	consent.		
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 28	Edit	checks	will	fire	in	real	time	as	data	is	being	entered	in	the	EDC	system	to	ensure	
quality	 data	 is	 provided.	 	 In	 addition	 to	 edit	 checks,	 queries	 will	 be	 generated	 as	
Discrepancy	 Notes	 from	 the	 Data	 Manager	 and	 Monitors.	 	 Sites	 will	 have	 ten	
business	days	to	update	a	query.		It	is	the	responsibility	of	the	coordinator	at	each	
site	 to	 ensure	 that	 data	 has	 been	 submitted.	 	 Cancer	 Insight	 QA	 personnel	 or	 the	
Sponsor’s	representative	will	perf orm	an	audit	of	the	site-specific	Flow	Sheets	and	
will	match	them	against	source	documents	to	ensure	the	quality	of	data	coming	to	
the	Data	Manager	in	the	EDC	per	the	internal	monitoring	plan.	
The	 database,	 hosted	 by	 OpenClinica,	 resides	 in	 a	 SAS	 70	 Type	 II	 data	 center	 and	
meets	ISO	17799	standards	for	information	security.	The	EDC	system	is	 HIPAA	and	
21	 CFR	 Part	 11	 compliant	 with	 robust	 audit	 logs,	 controlled	 user	 access ,	and	
electronic	signature/password	management.			
In	 addition	 to	 the	 site	 user,	 the	 Data	 Manager,	 the	 Monitors,	 the	 study	 PI	 and	
Sponsor/Sponsor	representative	have	access	to	the	database.		Each	user	is	assigned	a	role,	which	 grants	limited	access	and	functionalities	depende nt	up on	that	specific	
role.		
5.8	 Statistical	Methods	
5.8.1		 Rationale	for	study	design	
Individually,	CPI	 therapies	 have	been	approved	for	use	in	metastatic	melanoma	and	
the	 TLPLDC	 vaccine	 appears	 to	 provide	 benefit	 to	 these	 patients	 as	 well	 in	 small	
studies.			
	By	 stimulating	 the	 patients’	 immune	 system	 to	 produce	 tumor -reactive	 T -cells	
against	their	personal	cancer,	while	simultaneously	preventing	down-regulation	of	these	newly	induced/amplified	T	cells	in	the	tumor	microenvironment	could	result	
in	 a	 highly	 eff ective	 multimodality	 immunotherapy	 that	 could	 significantly	 impact	
clinical	 outcomes	 of	 patients	 with	 metastatic	 melanoma.	 	 While	 CPI	 have	 been	
proven	to	be	effective	in	metastatic	melanoma	patients	in	terms	of	tumor	response	as	 well	 as	 survival,	 the	 majority	 of	 metastatic	 melanoma	 patients	 still	 succumb	 to	
their	disease.		 Thus,	 the	CPI	monotherapy	is	not	sufficient	alone.		One	theory	is	that	
these	patients	lack	adequate	numbers	of	tumor -reactive	T	cells	on	which	the	CPI	can	
work.	 	 The	 TLPLDC	 vaccine	 generates	 tumor-reactive	 T	 cells	 as	 its	 primary	mechanism	of	action.		 Therefore,	intuitively	there	is	rationale	for	combining	the	two	
forms	of	immunotherapy.			
	5.8.2		Sample	size	determination	
In	 order	 to	 assess	 both	 the	 safety	 as	 well	 as	 the	 efficacy	 of	 adding	 the	 TLPLDC	
vaccine	to	SoC	CPI	in	metastatic	melanoma	patients,	a	total	of	up	to	45	patients	will	
be	 enrolled	 into	 this	 study.	 	 The	 primar y	 endpoint	 of	 efficacy	 is	 defined	 as	 the	
objective	 tumor	 response	 rate	 (ORR)	 (CR	 +	 PR)	 per	 RECIST	 criteria	 and	 iRECIST .		
With	 45	 patient s,	 the	 study	 will	 have	 an	 80%	 power	 to	 detect	 an	 absolute	 25%	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 29	improvement	in	 ORR	 compared	to	SoC	CPI	monotherapy	in	thes e	patients	 with	an	
alpha	 =	 0.05	 ( one-tailed).	 	 Furthermore,	 this	 number	 of	 patients	 will	 allow	 for	 a	
similar	level	of	detection	of	safety/toxicity	parameters.			
	
5.8.3		Data	analysis	
Tumor	response	to	the	CPI+TLPLDC	vaccine	will	be	evaluated 	by	the	site	primary	
investigators 	for	 each	 patient	 at	 multiple	 time	 points	 (approximately	 every	 3	
months	for	a	year).			
	The	time	to	 best	 tumor	response	 for	each	patient	 will	be	determined	from	the	date	
of	first	inoculation	 until	they	meet	a	specified	tumor	response	based	on	the	RECIST	
criteria 	and	iRECIST	 (Appendix	 B).		ORR	 (CR	+	PR)	as	well	as	the	clinical	beneficial	
response	rate	(CBR)	(CR	+	PR	+	SD) 	will	be	calculated	 and	represented	i n	waterfall	
plots	 and	 line	 graphs .	 	The	 progression	 free	 survival	 and	 overall	 survival	 will	 be	
determined	using	the	 Kaplan -Meyer	 method.		
	5.8.3.1		Study	patient	characteristics	
Demographic	characteristics	of	all	patients	will	be	summarized	including	age,	race,	
disease	histology, 	tumor	location,	 tumor	 depth ,	ulceration,	number	of	mitoses,	nodal	
status 	(number	 and	 micro-	 vs	 macro-metastasis),	 AJCC	 clinical	 stage,	 location	 and	
number	of	distant	metastases	(if	present),	 and	other	disease -directed	therapies	to	
include	 chemotherapy,	 radiation	 therapy,	 and	 biologic	 therapy	 including	 the	
checkpoint	 inhibitor	 used .	 	 Continuous	 variables	 will	 be	 summarized	 using	 the	
number	 of	 patients,	 mean,	 standard	 deviation,	 median,	 minimum,	 and	 maximum;	
and	 categorical	 variables	 will	 be	 summarized	 using	 the	 frequency	 count	 and	 the	
percentage	of	patients	in	each	category.		 	
5.8.3.2		Primary	efficacy	analysis	
The	 primary	 endpoint	 for	 efficacy	 is	 the	 overall	 study-wide	 objective	 tumor	
response	rate	in	response	to	the	TLPLDC	vaccine	being	added	to	SoC	CPI 	therapy.	
The	primary	investigators	at	each	site	will	determine	each	patient’s	tumor	response	
to	 the	 TLPLDC	 vaccine	 +	 CPI	 and	 classify	 the	 patient	 as	 a	 CR,	 PR,	 SD,	 or	 PD	 per	
RECIST	criteria	and	 iRECIST 	criteria 	as	delineated	in	Appendix	B.		Each	patient	will	
be	assessed	approximately	every	3	months	for	a	year .		Durability	of	response	will	
also	be	reported. 	
The	 primary	 efficacy	 analysis	 will	 be	 an	 accumulation	 of	 the	 individual	 patients’	
responses.		The	overall	study	ORR	 (CR	+	PR)	 will	be	 calculated	and	 reported	as	well	
as	the	median	durability	of	response.		Additionally,	the	CBR	(CR	+	PR	+	SD)	will	also	be	reported	with	median	durability	of	response.	
5.8.3.3		Secondary	efficacy	analysis	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 30	The	 ORR	 and	 rate/type	 of	 AEs	 will	 be	 compared	 to	 currently	 available	 CPI	
monotherapy	ORR	and	rate/type	of	AEs		using	proportional	statistical	analysis.			
5.8.3.4	Safety	analysis	
The	 incidence	 of	 treatment-emergent	 AEs,	 SAEs,	 severe	 AEs,	 AEs	 related	 to	 study	
drug	(defined	as	 not,	unlikely,	 possibly,	proba bly,	or	definitely	related	to	study	drug) 	
will	be	summarized.		
Time	 to	 AE	 onset	 will	 be	 estimated	 using	 the	 Kaplan-Meier	 method.	 In	 addition,	
duration	of	any	AE	with	>10%	incidence,	total	number	of	AEs,	SAEs,	and	related	AEs	
will	be	summarized..		
5.8.3.5	Immunologic	analysis	
Immunologic	 responses	 will	be	determined 	using	 phenotypic	and	functional	 assays	
(ex	vivo).	 	
Expression	percentages	will	be	compared	using	a	chi -square	test	while	continuous	
outcomes	will	be	compared	using	a	paired	t-test.			
For	 the	 ex	vivo	 response	 evaluated	 by	 the	 phenotypic	 and	 fu nctional	 assays ,	 the	
number	 of	 peptide-specific	 CTL	 will	 be	 determined	 at	 multiple	 time	 points	 (see	
Section s	5.3.4,	5.3.5,	and	5.3 .6)	during	the	trial.	 	
Changes	 from	 pre-vaccination	 levels	 to	 each	 time	 point	 will	 be	 compared, 	and	
differences	 will	be	evaluated	using	a	paired	t -test .	
In	 a	 series	 of	 exploratory	 analyses,	 the	 different	 immunologic	 response	 indicators	
(in	vivo	 and	 ex	vivo)	at	different	time	points	will	be	correlated	with	clinical	outcome	
in	order	t o	assess	for	any	predictors	of	outcome.		
5.8.3.6	Planned	analyses	
1)	Safety	will	be	monitored	continuously.	
2)	Objective	tumor	response	rates	will	be	assessed	in	real	time.	
3)	 The	 interim	 analysis	 response	 rates	 and	 comparisons	 will	 be	 completed	
12	months	 after	initiation	of	this	trial	to	assess	the	vaccine	safety	profile	and	
tumor	response	trends.		No	action	regarding	stopping	the	trial	will	be	taken	
based	on	this	analysis	unless	there	is	a	safety	concern.

6.0	 ADVERSE	EVENTS 		
Reporting	of	adverse	events	will	be	performed	in	accordance	with	the	Data	Safety	
Monitoring	Plan	 (DSMB)	(Appendix	F)	and	Sections	6.2	and	6 .3.	
6.1	 Adverse	Event	and	 Reporting	D efinitions 	
With	the	occurrence	of	an	 AE,	the	first	concer n	will	be	for	the	safety	of	the	 subject.	
Investigators	 are	 required	 to	 report	 to	 the	 IRB,	 medical	 monitor,	 clinical	 rese arch	
organization	(CRO)	 QA	Officer ,	or	designee 	and	CRO	 Regulatory	Affairs	Officer	any	
serious	adverse	event,	whether	 expected	 or	unexpected ,	and	which	is	assessed	by	
the	investigator	 to	 be	 possibly	 or	 probably 	related	 to	 or	 caused	 by	 the	vaccine	
components.	 	All	events	meeting	 the	outlined	criteria	will	be	re ported	for	the	time	
period	beginning	with	 any	amount	of	 exposure	to	vaccine	components	through 	the	
protocol -defined	 follow -up	period.	 The	 Regulatory	 Affairs	 Officer	 will	 then	 report	
the	event	to	the 	Sponsor. 	The	IND	Sponsor	or	Sponsor’s	 representative	will	 report	
these	to	the	FDA 	per	the	requirements	of	21	CFR	Section	312.32 .		Serious	criteria,	
definitions,	and	guidance	for	reporting	follow. 	
An	 adverse	 event	 (AE)	 is	 any	 untoward	 medical	 occurrence	 in	 a	 subject	
participating	 in	 an	 investigational	 study	 or	 protocol	 regardless	 of	 causality	
assessment.		
An	 adverse	 event	 can	 be	 an	 unfavorable	 and	 unintended	 sign	 (including	 an	
abnormal	 laboratory	 finding),	 symptom,	 syndrome	 or	 disease	 associated	 with	 or	
occurring	 during	 the	 use	 of	 an	 investigational	 product	 whethe r	 or	 not	 considered	
related	to	the	investigational	product. 	
Serious	adverse	events	(SAE)	 are	AEs	occurring	at	any	dose	which	meet	one	or	more	
of	the	following	serious	criteria:	
• Results	in	death	(i.e. ,	the	AE	caused	or	led	to	death)	
• Is	life-threatening	 (i.e.	the	AE	placed	the	subject	at	immediate	risk	of	death;	it	
does	not 	apply	to	an	AE	which	hypothetically	might	have	caused	the	death	if	
it	were	more	severe)	
• Requires	or	prolongs	inpatient	 hospitalization	 (i.e.,	the	AE	required	at	least	a	
24-hour	 hospitalization.	 (Inpatient	 hospitalization	 or	 prolonged	 a	
hospitalization	 beyond	 the	 expected	 length	 of	 stay; 	hospitalizations	 for	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 32	elective	 medical/surgical	 procedures,	 scheduled	 treatments,	 or	 routine	
check-ups	are	not	SAEs	by	this	criterion.)	
• Is	disabling	 (i.e.,	 the	AE	resulted	in	a	substantial	disruption	of	the	subject’s	
ability	to	carry 	out	normal	life	functions)	
• Is	a	 congenital	anomaly/birth	defect	 (i.e.,	an	adverse	outcome	in	a	child	or	
fetus	 of	 a 	subject	 exposed	 to	 the	 study	 drug	 prior	 to	 conception	 or	 during	
pregnancy) 	
• Does	 not	 meet	 any	 of	 the	 above	 serious	 criteria	 but	 may	 jeopardize	 the	
subject	 and	 may	 require	medical	or	surgical	intervention	 to	prevent	one	of	
the	outcomes	listed	above	
Expected	 AEs	 are	 those	 AEs	 that	 are	 listed	 or	 characterized	 in	 the 	current	
Investigator	Brochure. 	
Unexpected	 AEs	are	those	 not	listed	 in	the	current	 Investigator	Brochure 	(IB).		
This	 includes	 AEs	 for	 which	 the	 specificity	 or	 severity	 is	 not	 consistent	 with	 the 	
description	in	the	 IB.	For	example,	under	this	definition,	hepatic	necrosis	 would	be	
unexpected	if	the	Investi gator	Brochure	only	referred	to	 elevated	hepatic	enzymes	
or	hepatitis. 	
6.2		Reporting	of	Serious	Adverse	Events	Associated	with	This	Study	
Each	 site	 PI	 will	 within	 24	 hours	 of	 notification	 of	 the	 event	 report	 all	 related	 or	
unrelated	serious	AEs	occurring	in	subjects	enrolled	at	their	respective	study	site	to	the	Internal	Review	Board	(IRB)	of	their	site	(see	AE	Reporting	Algorithm,	Appendix	
G).	This	will	be	accomplished	by	 submitting	an	AE	report	memorandum	to	the	IRB	
per	the	IRB’s	site-specific	standard	operating	procedures.	 	
The	site	PI	will	also,	within	24	hours	of	notification	of	the	event,	forward	a	copy	of	
the	serious	adverse	event	 report	(CRF	Form	3.1)	 to	the	CRO	QA	Officer	 or	designee,	
and	to	the	CRO	Regulatory	Affairs	Officer.		
The	QA	Officer	 or	designee	 will	then	forward	the	report	to	the	Sponsor.	The 	Sponsor	
or	Sponsor’s	 representative	 will	 review	 the	 serious	 AE	 to	 determine	 the	 need	 for	
expedited	 reporting	 to	 the	 FDA.	 If	 expedited	 reporting	 is	 required,	 the	 site	 nurse	
coordinator	will	be	notified	by	the	QA	Officer	 or	designee	 to	complete	a	MedWatch	
FDA	Form	3500	(Appendix	H ).		
The	 Regulatory	 Affairs	 Officer	 will	 then	 submit	 the	 final	 report	 to	 the	 Sponsor	 or	
Sponso r’s	representative	who	will	 then	report	to	the	FDA.	
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 33	6.2.1		 MedWatch	3500A	reporting	guidelines	
In	addition	to	completing	appropriate	patient	demographic	and	suspect	medication	
information,	the	report	should	include	the	following	information	within	the	Event	
Description	of	the	MedWatch	3500A	form:	
o Protocol description (and number, if assigned) 
o Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known  
o Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  
o Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the AE to each 
investigational product and suspect medication 
Follow-up	information: 	
Additional	information	may	be	added	to	a	previously	submitted	report	by	any	of	the 	
following	methods:	
o Adding to the original MedWatch 3500A report and submitting as follow -up 
o Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow -up with 
the original MedWatch 3500A form 
o Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including  
subject identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, subject nu mber), protocol description and 
number, if assigned, brief adverse event description, and notation that additional 
or follow-up information is being submitted. (The patient identifiers  are 
important so that the new information is added to the correct initial report.)  
The	 CRO	 or	 Sponsor	 may	 contact	 the	 reporter	 for	 additional	 information,	
clarification,	 or	 current	 sta tus	 of	 the	 subject	 for	 whom	 an	 AE	was	 reported.	 For	
questions	r egarding	SAE	reporting,	you	may	contact	the	 CRO	QA	Officer	or	designee.	
Study	Drug	Relationship:	
The	 PI	will	determine	which	events	are	associated	with	the	use	of	study 	drug.	For	
reporting	 purposes,	 an	 AE	 should	 be	 regarded	 as	 possibly	 related	 to	 the	 use	 of	
vaccine	components	if	the	PI	 believes: 	
o There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and 
administration of vaccine components; and/or  
o There is a biologically plausible mechanism for vaccine components to cause or contribute to the AE; and 
o The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, 
or procedures. 
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 34	6.3	 Reporting	Requirements	for	IND	Sponsor	
For	sponsored	IND	Studies ,	there	are	additional	reporting	requirements	for	the	FDA	
in	accordance	with	the	guidance	set	forth	in	21	CFR	§	600.80.	Events	meeting	the	
following	criteria	need	to	be	submitted	to	the	FDA	as	expedited	IND 	Safety	Reports	
according	to	the	following	guidance	and	timelines:	
7	Calendar-Day	Telephone	or	Fax	Report:	 The	Sponsor	is	required	to	notify	the	FDA	
of	 any	 fatal	 or	 life -threatening	 AE	 that	 is	 unexpected	 and	 assessed	 by	 the	
investigator	 to	 be	 possibly	 related	 to	 the	 use	 of	 the	 investigational	 product.	 An	
unexpected	AE	is	one	that	is	not	already	described	in	the 	IB	for	the	vaccine.	Such	
events	are	to	be	reported	by	the	sponsor	to	the	FDA	and	within	 seven 	calendar	days	
of	first	learning	of	the	event. 	
15	Calendar-Day	Written	Report:	 The	Sponsor	is	also	required	to	notify	the	FDA	and	
all	 participating	 investigators, 	in	 a	 written	 IND	 Safety	 Report,	 of	 any	 serious,	
unexpected	 AE	 that	 is	 considered	 reasonably	 or	 possibly	 related	 to	 the	 use	 of	 the	
study	 agents.	 An	 unexpected	 AE	 is	 one	 that	 is	 not	 already	 described	 in	 the	
Investigator	Brochure	for	vaccine. 	
	
o Written IND Safety Reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in 
accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32. All safety reports previously filed 
with the IND concerning similar events should be analyzed and the significance 
of the new report in light of the previous, similar reports commented on. 
o Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events are to be submitted 
to the FDA and all participating investigators within 15 calendar days of first 
learning of the event. The FDA prefers these reports on a M edWatch 3500A 
Form but alternative formats are acceptable (e.g. summary letter).  
7.0	 INVESTIGATOR	REQUIREMENTS

regulatory	purposes.	 	
The	 informed	 consent	 document	 must	 be	 signed	 by	 the	 subject	 before	 his	 or	 her	
participation	 in	 the	 study.	 The	 case	 history	 for	 each	 subject	 shall	 document	 that	
informed	consent	was	obtained	prior 	to	participation	in	the	study.	 	
Copies	 of	the	informed	consent	 form	 documents	 must	be	provided	to	the	subject.	If	
applicable,	it	will	be	provided	in	a	certified	translation	of	the	local	language. 	
Signed	consent	forms	must	remain	in	each	subject’s	study	fi le	and	must	be	available	
for	verification	by	study	monitors	at	any	time.	
7.4	 Institutional	Review	 Board	or	Ethics	Committee	Approval	
This	protocol,	the	informed	consent	document,	and	relevant	supporting	information	
must	be	submitted	to	the	IRB	for	review	and	must	be	approved	before	the	study	is	
initiated.	 The	 study	 will	 be	 conducted	 in	 accordance	 with	 U.S.	 FDA,	 applicable

The	 Principal	 Investigator	 is	 responsible	 for	 keeping	 the	 IRB	 apprised	 of	 th e	
progress	 of	 the	 study	 and	 of	 any	 changes	 made	 to	 the	 protocol	 as	 deemed	
appropriate,	 but	 in	 any	 case	 the	 IRB	 must	 be	 updated	 at	 least	 once	 a	 year.	 The	
Principal	 Investigator	 must	 also	 keep	 the	 IRB	 informed	 of	 any	 significant	 adverse	
events.	 Investigators 	are	 required	 to	 promptly	 notify	 their	 respective	 IRB	 of	 all	
adverse	drug	reactions	that	are	both	serious	and	unexpected.	This	generally	refers	
to	 serious	 adverse	 events	 that	 are	 not	 already	 identified	 in	 the	 IB	and	 that	 are	
considered	 possibly	 or	 probably 	related	 to	 the	 molecule	 or	 study	 drug	 by	 the	
investigator.		
Some	 IRBs	 may	 have	 other	 specific	 adverse	 event	 requirements	 to	 which	
investigators	 are	 expected	 to	 adhere.	 Investigators	 must	 immediately	 forward	 to	
their	 IRB	 any	 written	 safety	 report	 or	 update 	provided	 by	 the	 Sponsor	 (e.g.,	 IND

Ethics	and	Regulatory	Considerations	
The	 protocol	 will	 be	 reviewed	 and	 approved	 by	 the	 IRB	 or	 Independent	 Ethics	
Committee	 (IEC)	 of	 each	 participating	 center	 prior	 to	 study	 initiation.	 A	 list	 of	
IRB/IEC	 members	 should	 be	 obtained	 by	 the	 investigator	 and	 provided	 to	 the	
sponsor	and	sponsor	rep resentative.	Any	documents	that	the	IRB/IEC	may	need	to	
fulfill	its	responsibilities,	such	as	protocol	amendments	and/or	information	from	the	
sponsor	 will	 be	 submitted	 to	 the	 IRB/IEC.	 The	 IRB/IEC’s	 written	 unconditional	
approval	 of	 the	 study	 protocol	 and	 t he	 informed	 consent	 form	 will	 be	 in	 the	
possession	of	the	PI	 and	the	 Sponsor	before	the	study	is	initiated.	 	
	
	
The	 IRB/IEC’s	 unconditional	 approval	 statement	 will	 be	 transmitted	 by	 the	
investigator	or	designee	to	the	sponsor/sponsor	representative	prior	to 	shipment	of	
study 	drug	supplies	to	the	site.	This	approval	document	must	refer	to	the	study	by	
exact	 protocol	 title	 and	 protocol	 version	 number/date	 and	 must	 identify	 the	documents	reviewed	and	the	date	of	review.		
Protocol	 modifications	 or	 changes	 may	 no t	 be	 initiated	 without	 prior	 written	
IRB/IEC	 approval	 except	 when	 necessary	 to	 eliminate	 immediate	 hazard	 to	 the	patients.	 Such	 modifications	 will	 be	 submitted	 to	 the	 IRB/IEC	 and	 written	
verification	 that	 the	 modification	 was	 submitted	 and	 IRB/IEC	acknowledgement/approval	 should	 be	 obtained	 and	 transmitted	 to	 the	
Sponsor/Investigator	or	Sponsor/Investigator’s	representative.	 	
The	 IRB/IEC	 must	 be	 informed	 by	 the	 principal	 investigator	 of	 any	 changes	 or	revisions	 of	 informed	 consent	 forms	 or	 other	 documents	 originally	 submitted	 for	
review;	serious	and/or	 unexpected	adverse	experiences	occurring	during	the	study;	
any	 new	 information	 that	 may	 affect	 adversely	 the	 safety	 of	 the	 patients	 or	 the	conduct	of	the	study;	annual	updates	and/or
	request	for	re -approval;	and	when	the	
study	has	been	completed.	
	
	7.5	 Study	 Monitoring	Requirements	
Site	 visits	 may	 be	 conducted	 by	 authorized	 Sponsor	 representative	 or	 CRO	
representatives	 to	 inspect	 study	 data,	 subjects’	 medical	 records,	 and	 CRFs	 in

Appendix B  
 
1. Quick Reference for the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST Criteria) 
 
 
A. Indications for use of RECIST Criteria 
- The RECIST criteria is useful in all trials where objective response is 
the primary study endpoint, as well as in trials where assessment of 
stable disease, tumor progression or time to progression analyses are 
undertaken, since all of these outcome measures are based on an 
assessment of anatomical tumor burden and  its change on the study.  
 
B. Identification of Lesions 
I. Measurable disease 
- All patients must have measurable disease to be enrolled into this trial.  
- All baseline imaging for determining these target lesions must be completed no more than 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment  
- Measurable disease includes:  
§ Tumors that can be accurately measured along the 
longest diameter  
§ Tumors must be >10mm by CT (CT must use 5mm cuts 
or smaller) 
§ If tumor lesions are measured on clinical exam, the lesion should be superficial, >10mm in diameter when 
measured by a caliber  
§ Tumors must be >20mm by chest xray.  
 
II. Lymph nodes must be measured along its shortest axis  
§ Nodes must be >15mm by CT scan (CT must use 5mm cuts or smaller) 
 
III. Target lesions 
- Target lesions must be determined by each primary investigator 
- Baseline imaging must be completed no more than 4 weeks before 
initiation of trial 
- All target lesions must be measurable tumors that are easily monitored with reproducible repeated measurements.  
§ Maximum of 5 target lesions 
§ Maximum  of 2 lesions per organ   
§ A sum of all the diameters for each target lesion is 
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 43	recorded and monitored throughout the study forming a 
baseline sum of diameters . 
- All other lesions will be deemed non -target lesions.  They may be 
followed throughout the trial,  but will not be incorporated into the 
baseline sum of diameters.  These non-target tumors must be 
recorded separately.  
IV. Imaging Modalities  
- All lesions must be measureable.  It is preferred to monitor each lesion 
with an imaging study if able.   
§ CT scans must be completed as IV contrast and a 5mm 
cuts. 
§ MRI may also be used.  
§ FDG-PET useful in monitoring lesions.  It should be 
combined with a CT scan for complete evaluation of 
tumors. 
C. Evaluation of Tumor Response  
- Tumor response of target lesions include:  
§ Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathologic lymph nodes must be <10mm 
(target or non-target nodes).  
§ Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the 
sum of diameters for target lesions in comparison to baseline sum of diameters.  
§ Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the 
sum of diameters for target lesions.  In addition to this 
increase, the sum of diameters must increase by at le ast 
5mm.  The development of new lesions is also evidence 
of PD. 
§ Stable Disease (SD): Tumors neither fit criteria for PR or 
PD. 
- Tumor response of non-target lesions include:  
§ CR - Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathologic 
lymph nodes must be <10mm (target or non-target nodes). 
§ Non-CR/Non -PD - Persistence of one or more non -target 
lesions and maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits. 
§ PD – Unequivocal progression of existing non -target 
tumors, or the appearance of new lesions.  
- The primary investigator at each site will verify the presence of changes in target/non-target lesions.   
- Target lesions which shrink, and are deemed too small to measure should be given a default measurement of 5mm.   
- If target lesions have completely dis appeared is should be measured 
as 0mm.   
- Lymph nodes may regress to <10mm but because they are still 
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 44	measurable, the sum of diameters may never equal 0mm in the setting 
of CR when they are included as target lesions.  
- Please see table below regarding  the Best overall response

2. Quick Reference for iRECIST Criteria 
 A. Indications: 
- The guidelines  continue to recommend use of RECIST 1.1 to define 
whether tumor lesions are measurable or non -measurable and the 
principles used to determine objective tumor response are largely unchanged from RECIST 1.1. The concept change for iRECIST is the 
resetting the bar if RECIST 1.1 progression is followed at the next 
assessment by tumor shrinkage.  
-iRECIST defines unconfirmed progress (iUPD) on the basis of RECIST 
1.1 principles; however, iUPD requires confirmation, which is done on the 
basis of observing either a further increase in size (or in the number of 
new lesions) in the lesion category in which progression was first identified in (ie, target or non-target disease), or progression (defined by RECIST 
1.1) in lesion categories that had not previously met REC IST 1.1 
progression criteria. However, if progression is not confirmed, but instead tumor  shrinkage occurs (compared with baseline), which meets the criteria 
of iCR, iPR, or iSD, then the bar is reset so that iUPD needs to occur again (compared with nadir values) and then be confirmed (by further 
growth) at the next assessment for iCPD to be assigned. If no change in tumor  size or extent from iUPD occurs, then the time point  response would 
again be iUPD. This approach allows atypical responses, such as dela yed 
responses that occur after pseudoprogression, to be identified, further 
Phase I/IIa Metastatic Melanoma vaccine trial     Confidential Version 2.0/23 Jun 2017 
 45	understood, and better characterized. 
-However, many aspects of new lesion assessment are unique to 
iRECIST. If a new lesion is identified (thus meeting the criteria for iUPD) 
and the patient is clinically stable, treatment should be continued. New 
lesions should be assessed and categorized as measurable or non-
measurable using RECIST 1.1 principles.  
-The algorithm for patients with no previous iUPD is identical to RECIST 
1.1. For patients with iUPD at the last timepoint response, the next 
timepoint response is dependent on the status of all le sions, including 
target, non-target, new lesion target, and new lesion non -target; on 
whether any increase in size has occurred (either a further increase in size 
or a sufficient increase to assign a new iUPD if the criteria were not 
previously met); or the appearance of additional new lesions.

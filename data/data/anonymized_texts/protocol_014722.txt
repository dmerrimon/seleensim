SPONSOR Investigator Initiated Protocol 
FUNDING ORGANIZATION

NUMBER OF SITES 1
RATIONALE Actinic keratoses (AK) are patches of dysplastic keratinocytes arising in sun-damaged skin.  These lesions are  precursors to cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and are treated to prevent progression to  SCC.  First-line  therapy  for AK include cryotherapy  and 
curettage, which target clinically visible lesions but do not  address the 
subclinical lesions in the field of ultraviolet radiation  damage.  Field 
therapy includes topical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. Ingenol  mebutate is the active compound 
found in Euphorbia peplus sap, and has been approved for treatment  
of actinic  keratoses in immunocompetent patients.  Ingenol mebutate  
0.015% is favored  over  other topical  treatments  for treatment of 
actinic keratoses on the  face due to the  brief  treatment course,  high 
clearance rate, and resolution without sequelae.  There  are no data on 
safety of  this medication in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant  
recipients (OTR).  OTR have  a high incidence of AK and high risk of 
developing SCC, and require frequent  field therapy. In addition, OTR 
generally have a higher burden of AK and require  treatment of a 
larger surface  area than  the 25 cm2 area labeled for ingenol mebutate  
0.015%. We plan to investigate the  safety  and efficacy  of ingenol  
mebutate 0.015% in OTR, with a treatment area  up to 100cm2.
The rationale  for an  increased dose and surface area for treatment in 
this study is that OTR typically have  an extensive  burden of AK, 
requiring treatment of larger areas such  as those described here.  The 
proposed treatment regimen better reflects  the 'real  world' need for 
treatment of a  larger surface  area  while evaluating the  safety  and local  
site reactions  associated  with  this treatment  regimen.
STUDY DESIGN This is  a single arm, open-label safety  study.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
To assess  the safety of topical ingenol mebutate  for treatment of the 
face in solid  organ transplant recipients. 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential

TEST PRODUCT,  
DOSE, AND ROUTE  
OF ADMINISTRATIONIngenol Mebutate, 0.015% topical  gel
Subjects will treat a 100 cm2 area  of the skin daily for 3 days based on 
the per label dosing for the 0.015% concentration,  and assuming a  
deliverable dose weight of 0.25g. Therefore, 4 tubes of the 0.15% concentration will be used in the treatment area  per day, for 3 
consecutive treatment days, for a total  of 12 tubes of the 0.015% 
concentration per patient. This will deliver  a dose of  1.5 mcg per cm2 
of treated area each day.  Subjects  will be instructed to  open  one tube 
at a time and apply contents  to one 25 cm2 skin quadrant, and then 
repeat for each of the  remaining three quadrants. The first application 
will be performed  in clinic under the  guidance  of the study 
coordinator.
   
DURATION OF SUBJECT PARTICIPATION AND DURATION OF STUDY
Subjects will be  on study  for up to 57 days
Screening:  up to 14 days
Treatment:  3 days 
Follow-up:  54 days
The total duration of the  study is expected  to be 8 months.  6 months 
for subject  recruitment and 2 months for final  subject follow-up.

of patients who experience:
1) Any  adverse event (AE) ascertained by patient report, physician 
evaluation, or laboratory  value.  
2) One or more serious adverse events  (SAE) as defined by CTCAEv4 
3) Adverse  events leading to  study  drug  discontinuation.   
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
Efficacy:
• Reduction in number of actinic keratoses:  defined as the percent  
change in actinic keratosis count  in the target  treatment area  on Day 
57, as compared to the  baseline lesion count.
• Partial clearance of lesions: defined as the proportion of patients with a reduction of 75% of more  in the number  of clinically visible 
AKs in the target treatment area at  Day 57, compared to baseline.
• Complete clearance  of lesions: defined  as the proportion of patients 
with complete  clearance of actinic keratoses  in the  target treatment 
area.
Local skin response:
• Local skin  response (LSR) as measured  by visual assessment by the 
investigator using a  4 point  scale  on six responses for a  maximum 
total of  24, according  to the LSR scoring scale. 
Patient Reported  Outcomes:
• Pain as measured  by the 0-10 VAS Numeric  Pain Distress Scale  (0 = 
no pain, 5 = moderate pain, 10 =  unbearable  pain).
Patient quality of life as measured by Skindex-16 survey
STATISTICS
Primary Analysis PlanThis is  a small descriptive study, with the primary  safety endpoint of 
the incidence rate of patients who experience:
1) Any  adverse event (AE) ascertained by patient report, physician 
evaluation, or laboratory  value, 2) One  or more serious adverse events 
(SAE) as defined by CTCAEv4, and 3) Adverse events leading to  
study drug discontinuation.   
The safety analysis will be  based  on the safety  population,  which is 
defined as  all randomized  patients who have  received at least one  dose 
of study medication  and who have  had at least one  post-baseline 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 10 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 safety evaluation.
Adverse events will be explored for trends or  heterogeneity between 
the two transplant  subgroups; lung and kidney.  If there is evidence 
for a difference between  groups, the subgroups will be reported 
separately.
The mean maximum LSR composite score,  the VAS score, and  the 
Skindex-16 scores and trend in scores  over the study visits will be 
reported as descriptive data.  The composite LSR score will be  
compared to  historical controls (Lebwohl  et al, NEJM 2012).
The efficacy  analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT)  
population. In the  ITT population, patients will be  counted in  the 
treatment group upon informed consent, regardless  of receiving any 
dose of study  medication. 
For efficacy  analysis, all missing values due to patient early 
termination from the study will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF)  method,  as appropriate.  For each patient, the 
Baseline values will be defined as those values recorded at Day 1 prior to dosing or Screening as appropriate.  Patients who  are lost-to-
follow-up after Baseline will be included to the ITT population carrying forward their Baseline values,  i.e., these  patients will be 
considered as treatment  failures. 
Percent reduction  in number of actinic  keratoses and proportions of 
patients with partial and complete clearance of actinic keratoses  will 
be presented descriptively and  visualized  as histograms.   These scores 
will be compared  to historical controls (Lebwohl et al, NEJM 2012).
Rationale for Number  
of SubjectsThis is  a pilot descriptive sample, not powered for analysis.  The 
sample size  of 20 patients is selected to achieve a reportable sample 
size in two subgroups  of organ transplant  recipients.

2STUDY RATIONALE
Actinic keratoses (AK) are precursors to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and are treated to prevent  progression to SCC.  First-line therapy for AK include cryotherapy 
and curettage, which target clinically  visible  lesions  but do not  address the subclinical 
lesions in the field of ultraviolet radiation  damage.  Field therapy includes  topical 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and photodynamic  therapy. Ingenol mebutate  is the active

topical treatments for treatment of actinic keratoses  on the face due to  the brief treatment 
course, high clearance  rate, and  resolution without sequelae. 
There are no data on safety of this medication in immunosuppressed  solid  organ transplant 
recipients (OTR).  OTR have  a high incidence of AK and high risk of developing  SCC, 
and require frequent field  therapy. In addition, OTR generally have a higher burden of AK 
and require treatment of a larger surface  area than  the 25 cm2 area labeled for ingenol 
mebutate 0.015%. We plan to investigate  the safety and efficacy of ingenol mebutate 
0.015% in  OTR, with a  treatment area up to 100 cm2.
The rationale  for an  increased dose and surface area for treatment in this study is that OTR 
typically have an extensive  burden of AK, requiring treatment of larger areas such as 
those described here.  The proposed  treatment regimen better reflects the 'real world'  need  
for treatment of a larger  surface area while evaluating  the safety and local site reactions 
associated with  this treatment regimen.
2.1 Risk  / Benefit Assessment
The risks of ingenol  mebutate are primarily  local site reactions of redness,  flaking,  
crusting, swelling,  blisters, or  erosions. These  typically begin at day 1 of treatment. The 
adverse reactions reported  in >=2%  of patients treated with  ingenol  mebutate  were 
application site pain, pruritus, and infection;  periorbital edema, and headache. We  will 
monitor the patients at day 4 and counsel  them on mitigating site reactions with  gentle  
skin care, cold packs, pain control  if needed.  Patients will also be  counseled to  carefully  
avoid the eye and  lip area. We expect the infection rate in OTR to be  less than the  reported 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 12 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 rate of 3% as the  majority  of OTR are  on routine  antibiotic prophylaxis;  any infections 
will be recorded as adverse events  and treated according to  standard of care. 
If a patient has a   (1) local skin response  score  of 3 or greater  in any individual  category, 
and (2) associated  symptoms unrelieved by supportive care such as ice packs and  
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), then  1% topical hydrocortisone cream or 
ointment is allowed after Day 4 at the  discretion of the investigator.
Ingenol mebutate has accepted benefits  for AK which outweigh the risks.  OTR have a 
high burden of AK and frequently require multiple rounds of field treatment to  reduce  this 
sign of ultraviolet radiation induced  skin damage.  Other treatments  require long-term 
applications or in-office light; ingenol has the  benefit of being a short course.  Ingenol 
mebutate is approved for immunocompetent patients,  but there is no safety data in OTR.  
Despite this,  the medication has been frequently used off-label in  OTR and  is generally 
believed to be safe due to the absence of  systemic absorption.  One recent case reported 
brisk local site reaction without systemic adverse events. 
It is difficult to obtain  insurance coverage for ingenol mebutate in OTR without 
demonstrating failure of  multiple other treatments for AK. Participants in this  study will 
also benefit  from access  to ingenol mebutate. 
3STUDY OBJECTIVES
3.1 Primary Objective
The primary objective  is to  assess the  safety of topical ingenol mebutate 0.015 % for 
treatment of the  face in solid organ transplant  recipients.
3.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives  are (1) to evaluate  the efficacy of ingenol mebutate for reduction 
of actinic  keratoses on the face in organ  transplant  recipients; (2) to  investigate the local 
skin response to ingenol  mebutate in organ  transplant recipients; (3)  to investigate the 
effect of  topical treatment  with ingenol  mebutate  on patient reported outcomes of pain and 
quality of  life in organ transplant  recipients.
4 STUDY  DESIGN
4.1 Study Overview
This is  a single arm, open-label interventional study of ingenol mebutate 0.015% in solid 
organ transplant recipients. Twenty subjects are planned; 10 kidney transplant recipients and 10 lung transplant  recipients. These  populations have been  selected as they represent 
the spectrum of solid  organ transplantation:  kidney transplant recipients are the largest 
transplant population,  but have lower  levels of immunosuppression and  skin cancer risk. 
Lung transplant recipients  have the highest burden of skin cancer and  actinic  keratoses.

11ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING  AND DOCUMENTATION
11.1 Adverse  Events
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence in  a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a  pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily  have  a causal 
relationship with the  treatment.  An AE is therefore any  unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom  or disease temporally associated  
with the administration  of an investigational  product,  whether  or not related  to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE  is one of a type not identified in nature, 
severity, or  frequency in the current  U.S.  package  insert or of greater  severity or frequency  
than expected  based on the information in the U.S. package insert.
The Investigator will probe, via  discussion  with the  subject, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each  subject  visit  and record the information  in the site’s source  documents.  
Adverse events will be recorded  in the patient  CRF.  Adverse events will be described by 
duration (start and stop dates and  times), severity,  outcome, treatment and relation  to 
study drug, or if  unrelated,  the cause.
AE Severity
The National  Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be  used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities  judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be 
found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in  the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table  1 below should be used to grade severity.  It  should be pointed  
out that the term “severe”  is a measure of intensity and that a  severe AE is not necessarily  
serious.
Table 1.  AE Severity  Grading
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or  mild discomfort; no limitation  in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject  may be aware of the  sign  
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to  moderate limitation in activity, no or  minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalizations possible.
Life-threatening (4) The subject  is at risk of  death due to the adverse  experience as it 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 24 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
AE Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship of an AE  to the  study  drug  should  be assessed using  the following the 
guidelines in Table 2.
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study  Drug
Relationship
to DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity  of agent; or an event that follows a  reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug;  that follows a known or expected  response 
pattern to the suspected  drug; that is confirmed  by stopping  or reducing  the dosage  of 
the drug;  and that  is not explained by any  other reasonable hypothesis.
Probably An event that  follows  a reasonable  temporal sequence from  administration  of the  
drug; that follows  a known or expected response pattern  to the  suspected drug;  that is 
confirmed by stopping or reducing  the dosage of  the drug; and  that is unlikely to be 
explained by the known characteristics of  the subject’s clinical state or by other  
interventions.
Possibly An event that  follows  a reasonable  temporal sequence from  administration  of the  
drug; that follows  a known or expected response pattern  to that  suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number  of other factors.
Unrelated An event that  can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the  study 
drug.
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
An SAE is  defined as any AE occurring at any  dose that results in  any of the following 
outcomes:
death
a life-threatening adverse experience
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of  existing  hospitalization
a persistent or  significant disability/incapacity
a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Other important medical  events may also be considered an SAE when,  based  on 
appropriate medical judgment, they  jeopardize  the subject  or require intervention to  
prevent one of the  outcomes listed. 
11.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting
The study site will document all SAEs that occur (whether  or not related to study drug) 
per UCSF CHR Guidelines.  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is  obtained  and end after  procedures  for the final study visit have  been completed.
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 25 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 In accordance with the  standard operating  procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board  (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee  (IEC), the site investigator will report 
SAEs to the IRB/IEC.  
  
12DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT  OF SUBJECTS
12.1 Early  Discontinuation of Study Drug 
A subject  may  be discontinued from study treatment  at any time if  the subject, or the 
investigator feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  The  following is  a 
list of  possible reasons for  study treatment discontinuation:
Subject withdrawal of consent  
Subject is not compliant with  study procedures
Adverse event that  in the  opinion of  the investigator would be in the best interest of the 
subject to discontinue study  treatment
Protocol violation  requiring discontinuation  of study treatment
Lost to follow-up
Positive pregnancy test  (females)
If a subject  is withdrawn  from treatment  due to an adverse event, the subject will be  
followed and treated by the Investigator  until the abnormal parameter or symptom has 
resolved or  stabilized.  
All subjects who discontinue  study  treatment  should come in for an  early discontinuation 
visit as soon  as possible and then should be  encouraged to  complete all remaining  
scheduled visits and  procedures.
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason,  specified  
or unspecified, and without prejudice.
Reasonable attempts will be made  by the investigator to  provide a reason  for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s  withdrawal  from  the study will be specified in  
the subject’s  source documents  Refer  to Section 10 for early termination procedures.
12.3 Withdrawal of Subjects from  the Study
A subject  may  be withdrawn  from  the study at any time if the subject or the investigator  
feels that it is not in the  subject’s best interest to continue.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason,  specified  
or unspecified, and without prejudice.
Reasonable attempts will be made  by the investigator to  provide a reason  for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s  withdrawal  from  the study will be specified in  
the subject’s  source documents.   As noted  above, subjects who  discontinue study 
treatment early (i.e., they  withdraw prior to Visit 6) should  have an  early discontinuation 
visit. Refer to Section  10 for early termination procedures.  Subjects who withdraw after 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 26 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 Visit 2  but prior to Visit 6 should be encouraged to come in  for a  final visit (and the 
procedures to be  followed would include  those for their next scheduled visit).  
12.4 Replacement of Subjects
Subjects who withdraw from the study treatment will not  be replaced.   
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
13PROTOCOL  VIOLATIONS
A protocol  violation  occurs when the  subject or investigator fails to adhere to  significant  
protocol requirements affecting the inclusion,  exclusion,  subject safety and primary 
endpoint criteria.   Protocol  violations for this study include, but are not  limited  to, the 
following:
Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria
Failure to apply ingenol mebutate 0.015% gel per protocol.
Use of a prohibited concomitant medication
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in  a 
protocol violation. 
When a protocol violation  occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a  Protocol 
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This  form will be signed  by the

14DATA  SAFETY MONITORING
Due to the scope of this study, there  will be  no formal Data Safety  Monitoring  Board 
(DSMB) or Data Monitoring  Committee  (DMC). This is an  open-label,  single-center  
study for an FDA-approved medication, and the investigator will have access to  all study 
data. 
15STATISTICAL  METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to the analysis of the final study data,  a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP)  will 
be written describing all  analyses that will be performed.  The  SAP will contain any 
modifications to the  analysis plan described below.   
15.1 Data  Sets  Analyzed
All eligible patients  who  are enrolled in the study and receive  at least  one dose of the 
study drug (the Safety Population) and who have  had at least one  post-baseline  safety 
evaluation will  be included in the  safety analysis.
15.2 Demographic  and Baseline Characteristics
The following demographic variables at screening will be summarized: race, gender,  age, 
height and weight.   
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 27 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 15.3 Analysis  of Primary Endpoint
This is  a small descriptive study, with the primary  safety endpoint of the incidence rate  of 
patients who experience:
1) Any  adverse event (AE) ascertained by patient report, physician evaluation, or 
laboratory value,  2) One  or more serious adverse  events (SAE)  as defined by CTCAEv4,  
and 3) Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation.   
Adverse events will be explored for trends or  heterogeneity between the two transplant  
subgroups; thoracic and  abdominal.  If there is evidence for a difference  between groups, 
the subgroups will be  reported separately.
15.4 Analysis  of Secondary Endpoints
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by each  secondary endpoint.  
The mean maximum LSR composite score,  the VAS score, and  the Skindex-16  scores and 
trend in  scores  over  the study visits will be reported as descriptive data.   The  composite 
LSR score will be  compared to historical controls  (Lebwohl et al, NEJM 2012).
The efficacy  analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT)  population. In the ITT 
population, patients will be counted  in the treatment  group  upon informed consent, and 
receipt of at least one  dose of study medication.  
For efficacy  analysis, all missing values due to patient early termination from  the study 
will be imputed using last observation carried forward  (LOCF) method, as appropriate. 
For each  patient,  the Baseline  values  will be defined as  those values recorded at Day  1 
prior to dosing or Screening as appropriate.  Patients who  are lost-to-follow-up  after 
Baseline will be  included to the ITT  population carrying forward their Baseline values,  
i.e., these patients will be considered as  treatment failures. 
Percent reduction  in number of actinic  keratoses and proportions of patients with partial  
and complete clearance of  actinic keratoses will be presented descriptively and visualized 
as histograms.  These  scores will be compared to historical controls (Lebwohl et  al, NEJM 
2012).
15.5 Interim  Analysis
Not applicable.
15.6 Sample Size  and Randomization
This is  a pilot descriptive sample, not powered for analysis.  The sample size of 20 
patients is  selected to achieve a reportable sample size in  two subgroups of organ 
transplant recipients.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 16DATA  COLLECTION, RETENTION  AND MONITORING
16.1 Data  Collection Instruments
The Investigator will prepare and maintain  adequate and accurate source documents 
designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject treated with 
the study drug.  
Study personnel at  each  site will enter  data from source documents corresponding to  a 
subject’s visit into the  protocol-specific paper Case Report Form (CRF) when the 
information corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be  identified  by 
name in the study database or on any study documents to be  collected,  but will be 
identified by a site number, subject  number and initials.
If a correction is made on a CRF,  the study staff  member will line  through  the incorrect 
data, write in  the correct data and initial  and date the  change.
The Investigator is responsible  for all information collected on subjects enrolled  in this 
study.  All data  collected during the course of this study must  be reviewed  and verified  for 
completeness and accuracy by the Investigator.   A copy of the CRF will remain at the 
Investigator’s site at the completion  of the study.
16.2 Data  Management Procedures
The data will  be entered into a  validated  database.  The Data Management  group will be  
responsible for  data processing, in accordance with procedural documentation.   Database  
lock will occur once quality assurance  procedures have been  completed.
All procedures for  the handling and analysis  of data  will be conducted  using good 
computing practices  meeting FDA guidelines for  the handling and  analysis of data for 
clinical trials.
16.3 Data  Quality Control and Reporting
After data have been entered  into the  study database,  a system  of computerized data 
validation checks will be  implemented and applied  to the database on a  regular basis. 
Query reports (Data Clarification Requests) pertaining to  data omissions  and 
discrepancies will be forwarded to the  Investigators  and study monitors for resolution.  
The study database  will be updated in accordance  with the resolved  queries.  All  changes  
to the study database will be documented.
16.4 Archival of Data
The database  is safeguarded against  unauthorized access by established security 
procedures; appropriate backup  copies  of the database and  related  software  files  will be  
maintained.  Databases are backed up by the database administrator in conjunction  with  
any updates or changes  to the database.   
At critical junctures of the protocol  (e.g., production of interim reports and  final reports), 
data for analysis is locked and cleaned  per established procedures.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 16.5 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records
The Investigator must make  study data  accessible  to authorized representatives of Leo 
Pharma , IRB/IEC, and  Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon request.  A file 
for each subject must  be maintained that includes the  signed Informed Consent,  HIPAA 
Authorization and Assent Form and copies of  all source documentation related to that  
subject.  The  Investigator  must ensure  the reliability and  availability of source documents 
from which the information on the CRF  was derived.
All study  documents (patient files, signed informed  consent forms, copies of CRFs, Study  
File Notebook, etc.)  must  be kept secured for  a period of two years following marketing of 
the investigational product  or for  two years  after centers have been notified  that the IND 
has been  discontinued.  There may  be other circumstances for  which  Leo Pharma  is 
required to maintain  study records  and, therefore, should be contacted  prior to  removing 
study records for any reason.
16.6 Subject Confidentiality
In order  to maintain subject confidentiality,  only a site number, subject  number  and 
subject initials  will identify all study subjects on CRFs and  other documentation.  
Additional subject confidentiality issues (if applicable) are  covered in  the Clinical  Study  
Agreement.
17ADMINISTRATIVE, ETHICAL, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
The study will be  conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection  of 
Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50),  Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and 
Obligations of Clinical  Investigators (21 CFR 312).
To maintain confidentiality, all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and  other  
records will be identified by  a coded  number and initials only.  All study records will be  
kept in a locked file cabinet and code  sheets linking a patient’s name to a  patient 
identification number  will be stored separately in another locked file cabinet.   Clinical  
information will not be  released without written permission of the subject, except  as 
necessary for monitoring  by the FDA.  The Investigator must also comply  with all 
applicable privacy regulations  (e.g., Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act 
of 1996,  EU Data Protection Directive  95/46/EC).
17.1 Protocol Amendments
Any amendment  to the protocol will be  written by the investigator..   Protocol amendments 
cannot be implemented without  prior  written IRB/IEC approval except as necessary to 
eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  A protocol amendment  intended to  
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients  may be implemented immediately, 
provided the  IRBs  are notified within five  working days.
17.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees
The protocol  and consent form will be reviewed and  approved by the IRB/IEC of each 
participating center prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of causality will be reported to the IRB/IEC in accordance with the standard  operating 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 30 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 procedures and  policies of the IRB/IEC, and  the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC 
informed as  to the progress of the  study.   The  Investigator will obtain  assurance of 
IRB/IEC compliance with regulations.
Any documents  that the IRB/IEC may need  to fulfill its responsibilities  (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, U.S. package insert, consent  forms, information  concerning patient 
recruitment, payment or compensation  procedures, or other pertinent information) will be 
submitted to the  IRB/IEC.   The  IRB/IECs  written  unconditional approval of the study 
protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator  
before the study is  initiated.   The IRB/IECs unconditional approval statement will be 
transmitted by the  Investigator to Leo  Pharma  prior to  the shipment  of study supplies  to 
the site.   This  approval must refer to the study by exact  protocol  title and  number  and 
should identify the  documents reviewed and the  date  of review.
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications  or changes may not be initiated without 
prior written IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate  hazards  to 
the patients or when the change(s)  involves only logistical or administrative aspects  of the 
study.  Such modifications  will be  submitted to the IRB/IEC  and written verification that 
the modification was submitted and subsequently  approved should be  obtained.  
The IRB/IEC must  be informed of revisions to other  documents originally submitted for 
review; serious and/or  unexpected  adverse experiences occurring during the study in  
accordance with the  standard operating  procedures and policies of the IRB; new  
information that  may affect adversely  the safety  of the patients of the conduct of the study;  
an annual update  and/or  request for re-approval; and when the study has been completed.
17.3 Informed Consent Form 
Informed consent will be  obtained in accordance with the  Declaration  of Helsinki, ICH  
GCP, US Code of Federal  Regulations  for Protection of Human  Subjects (21 CFR  
50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health  Insurance Portability  and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable),  and local  regulations.
The Investigator will prepare the informed  consent form,  assent and HIPAA authorization 
and provide the documents to Leo  Pharma  for approval prior to submission  to the 
IRB/IEC.  The consent  form generated by the Investigator must be acceptable to  Leo 
Pharma and be approved  by the IRB/IEC.  The written consent document will embody the 
elements of  informed consent as described in the International Conference on 
Harmonisation and  will also comply with local  regulations. The Investigator will send  an 
IRB/IEC-approved copy of the Informed Consent Form to Leo  Pharma for the study file.
A properly executed, written, informed  consent  will be obtained from each subject prior to  
entering the subject into the trial.   Information  should  be given in both  oral and written 
form and subjects (or  their legal  representatives) must be  given  ample opportunity  to 
inquire about details of the study.  If appropriate  and required by the local  IRB/IEC, assent  
from the subject will also be obtained.  If a subject  is unable to sign the  informed  consent 
form (ICF) and the HIPAA authorization, a legal representative may sign for  the subject.    
A copy of the  signed  consent form will be  given to the subject or legal representative  of 
the subject and the original will be  maintained  with the subject’s records.

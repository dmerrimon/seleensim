NAME OF STUDY TREATMENT:  ABP 798
TITLE OF STUDY:  A Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Compare Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics, Efficacy and Safety of ABP 798 wi th Rituximab in Subjects with Moderate to 
Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis  
STUDY CENTERS:   Approximatel y 80 sites in Europe and North America 
STUDY PERIOD:   Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive ABP 798 or rituximab (US) or rituximab (EU).  
The end of trial will be the date when the last subject has completed 
their last stud y assessment.  PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 1/3 
PLANNED STUDY DATES: 29 April 2016 to 28 February 2018.  The expected enrollment 
duration is 12 months, and each sub ject will participate for up to 52 weeks.  
OBJECTIVES:   
Primary Objective:  The primary objective for this study is to demonstrate pharmacokinetic (PK) 
similarity (as assessed principally by area under the serum concentration- time curve [AUC] from 
time 0 extrapolated to infinity [AUC inf] and the maximum observed serum concentration [C max] 
following the 2nd infusion of 1st dose) of ABP 798 following 2 intravenous (IV) infusions of 
1000 mg each, relative to that of 2 IV infusions of 1000 mg each of rituximab (US) and of rituximab (EU). 
Secondary Objective(s):  The secondary objectives are 
to demonstrate PK similarity between rituximab (US) and rituximab (EU) as
assessed by AUC
inf and by C max after second infusion of the first dose
to assess the clinical efficacy  of ABP 798 compared with rituximab
to assess the safety and immunogenicity of ABP 798 compared with rituximab.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled 
3-arm study in adult subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an 
inadequate response or intolerance to other di sease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), 
which must include intolerance or inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) inhibitor therapies.  Approximately 300 subjects (100 per treatment group) will be enrolled.  
The subjects will be randomized to receive either ABP 798 1000 mg x 2 (treatment group A) 
infusions given 2 weeks apart, or rituximab (US) (t reatment group B), or rituximab (EU) (treatment 
group C) 1000 mg x 2, given 2 weeks apart in a double-blinded fashion.  Randomization will be 
stratified by geographic region, seropositivity (r heumatoid factor [RF]-positive and/or cyclic 
citrullinated peptide [CCP]-positive vs. RF-negat ive, and CCP-negative), and number of prior 
biologic therapies used for RA (1 vs. > 1).   An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) wi ll evaluate the safety data throughout the 
study, including an initial safety analysis after t he first 18 subjects have received the first dose 
(1000 mg x 2 infusions of either ABP 798 or rituximab [EU] or rituximab [US]). 
At week 24, the subjects in treatment groups A and C will continue with and receive the second 
dose of the same treatment, and the subjects in treatment group B will transition to treatment 
group A1 and receive ABP 798 1000 mg x 2 as their second dose.  Retreatment may occur 
earlier, ie, anytime from week 16 to week 24, in individual subjects, if necessary in the opinion of 
the Investigator. The end of study (EOS) will be at week 48 (or 24 weeks after the first infusion of the second dose 
for subjects retreated before week 24), and a fi nal analysis will be performed when all subjects 
have completed or have had the opportunit
y to complete the week 48/EOS assessments.

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS:  Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive ABP 798, rituximab (US), or rituximab (EU) , stratified by geographic region, seropositivity 
(RF-positive and/or CCP-positive vs. RF-negat ive and CCP-negative) and number of prior 
biologic therapies used for RA (1 vs. > 1).  The sample size will provide > 90% power to 
demonstrate similarity on the primary PK endpoints,  based on an assumption of between-subject 
variability (as measured by coefficient of variation) of 40%, true geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1 
among ABP 798, rituximab (US), or rituximab (EU), a margin of (0.8, 1.25), and 15% dropout by 
week 24.  The PK similarity will be tested between ABP 798 versus rituximab (US) and ABP 798 
versus rituximab (EU), each with a significance level of 0.05.  The similarity between rituximab 
(US) and rituximab (EU) will be evaluated as well.
STUDY TREATMENT(S):   
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: 
ABP 798 (Treatment A) 500 mg/mL given at 1000 mg IV x 2 infusions 2 weeks apart 
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration: 
Rituximab (US) (Treatment B) or rituximab (EU)  (Treatment C) 500 mg/mL given at 1000 mg IV x 
2 infusions 2 weeks apart 
DURATION OF TREATMENT:   Subjects will receive a first dose (2 infusions at days 1 and 15), 
followed by a second dose (2 infusions 2 weeks apart beginning at week 24 or earlier, ie, anytime from week 16 to week 24, in individual subjects, if necessary in the opinion  of the Investigator), 
with assessment until week 48 (or 24 weeks after the first infusion of the second dose for subjects retreated before week 24), plus a screening period of up to 4 weeks, for a total of up to 52 weeks.  A total of 2 doses will be administered during t he study; each dose will co nsist of 2 infusions, 
2 weeks apart. 
STUDY EVALUATIONS:   
Primary Criteria:  
 AUC inf, Cmax following the second infusion of the first dose 
Secondary Criteria:  Percent of subjects with complete depleti on in CD19+ cell count from day 1 to day 3 
 Disease Activity Score (DAS)28-CR P change from baseline at week 24 
 ACR20,  ACR50 and ACR70   
 AUC from time 0 on day 1 prior to the first infusion of the first dose to 14 days postdose 
(day 15) (AUC
0-14 day ), AUC from time 0 to week 12 (AUC 0-12 wk ), C max following the first 
infusion of the first dose 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 8 of 77  
Confidential   Safety Criteria: 
 Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
 Clinically significant changes in laboratory values and vital signs  
 Incidence of antidrug antibodies  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
The PK similarity will be demonstrated by compar ing the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the 
GMR of test (ABP 798)-to-reference (ri tuximab [US] or rituximab [EU]) and rituximab [US] to  
rituximab [EU] for AUC inf and for Cmax following the second infusion of the first dose with the 
bounds of 0.8 to 1.25 , where α=0.05.  PK parameters w ill be calculated using non-
compartmental methods.  Point estimates and CIs for the GMR will be estimated from an 
analysis of covariance model using the PK Analys is Set, consisting of all randomized subjects 
with an evaluable serum concentration-time profile.  
   
Clinical equivalence will be evaluated for DAS28- CRP at week 24 using the Full Analysis Set 
consisting of all randomized subjects.  If PK similarity is establis hed between rituximab (US) 
and rituximab (EU), the 2 arms will be comb ined into a single reference arm for the 
primary assessment of clinical equivalence between ABP 798 and rituximab.  The results 
for ABP 798 vs. rituximab (EU) and ABP 798 vs . rituximab (US) will be provided for 
descriptive purposes. If PK similarity is  not established, the ABP 798 arm will be 
compared to each of the individual rituximab arms separately to establish clinical equivalence of ABP 798 to the individual reference arms.   
 
With the planned sample size, there is 94% probability that the 90% CI of the difference 
between the ABP 798 arm and the pooled rituximab (rituximab[EU] and rituximab[US]) 
arm and 83% probability that the 90% CI of t he difference between test (ABP 798) and 
reference (US-licensed rituximab or EU-autho rized rituximab) in DAS28-CRP change from 
baseline at week 24 will fall into the equivalence margin of ± 0.6 (EULAR response criteria), 
assuming a standard deviation of 1.4 ( Volkmann et al, 2010 ). DAS28-CRP at other timepoints 
and ACR20, 50 and 70 will be summarized descriptively.  
 In addition, all categorical variables will be summarized using the number and percent of 
subjects falling into each category and all cont inuous variables will be summarized using mean, 
standard error or standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and number of subjects.  
Safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively as well, based on all randomized subjects 
who received at least one infusion of IP 
(ie, Safet y Anal ysis Set ).

Confidential6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Disease Review 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic infl ammatory disease of unknown etiology in 
which patients exhibit systemic features such as fatigue, low grade fever, weight loss, 
anemia, and increased systemic levels of acute phase reactants (eg, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rates [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]; Aletaha et al, 2010).  Although 
the disease is systemic in nature, the primary target tissues are the synovial membrane, 
cartilage, and bone (McInnes et al, 2007), which exhibit uncontrolled synovium/pannus proliferation and excess fluid production, and ultimately undergo progressive destructive 
arthropathy (Aletaha et al, 2010 ; Choy et al, 2001).   
The pathologic processes in RA appear to be primarily driven by B cells, by autoantibody 
production, by antigen presentation to T cells, and by promoting inflammation through the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells (Tuscano and Sands, 2009 ).  
Targeting of B cells has become a major therapeutic approach in RA.  Therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies have been developed with the aim of depleting B cells and 
reducing the RA disease process.  The depleting activity of B cell-targeted monoclonal antibodies largely relies on 2 Fc-dependent mechanisms: antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-medi ated cytotoxicity (CDC).  The engagement of 
effector cells by therapeutic monoclonal ant ibodies involves the interaction of the 
monoclonal antibodies Fc with Fc γ receptors on the surface of natural killer cells, 
monocytes/macrophages, or neutrophils ( Blüml et al, 2013 ).  
6.2 Rituximab 
Rituximab (Rituxan®, MabThera®) is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human 
monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa antibody directed against the B cell specific 
CD20 antigen.  In RA patients, treatment with rituximab induces depletion of peripheral 
B lymphocytes, with the majority of patients demonstrating near complete depletion (CD19 counts below the lower limit of quantification, 20 cells/ μL) within 2 weeks after 
receiving the first dose.  Most patients showed peripheral B cell depletion for at least 
6 months.  A small proportion of patients (~4%) had prolonged peripheral B cell 
depletion lasting more than 3 years after a single course of treatment (Biogen Idec, 2013).  
Total serum Ig levels, IgM, IgG, and IgA were reduced at 6 months with the greatest 
change observed in IgM.  In RA patients during repeated rituximab treatment, 23.3%, 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 20 of 77  
Confidential5.5%, and 0.5% of patients experienced decreases in IgM, IgG, and IgA concentrations 
below the lower limit of normal, respectively, at any time after receiving rituximab.  The clinical consequences of decreases in Ig levels in RA patients are unclear ( Biogen Idec, 
2013). 
Treatment with rituximab in patients with RA is associated with reduction of certain 
biologic markers of inflammation such as interleukin (IL)-6, CRP, serum amyloid protein (SAA), S100 A8/S100 A9 heterodimer complex (S100 A8/9), anti-cyclic citrullinated 
peptide (anti-CCP), and rheumatoid factor (RF; Biogen Idec, 2013 ). 
Rituximab is indicated, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of 
adult patients with moderately- to severely-active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies.  Rituximab is approved for use in other indications such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and microscopic polyangiitis 
(Biogen Idec, 2013).   
6.3 Compound Review 
ABP 798 is being developed as a biosimilar candidate to Rituxan®, MabThera® 
(rituximab) for the treatment of RA and other indications.  The active ingredient of ABP 798 is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which has the same ami no acid 
sequence as rituximab.  ABP 798 has the same pharmaceutical form and dosage 
strength as FDA US-licensed rituximab [rituximab (US), Rituxan
®] and European 
Medicines Agency EU-authorized rituximab [rituximab (EU), MabThera®]. 
Similarity of ABP 798 to rituximab has been shown using bioanalytical methods and pre-
clinical studies.  As outlined in the guide line on similar biological medicinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies, applicants are expected to provide data on similarity 
of pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacody namics (PD), safety and efficacy.    
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information.   
6.4 Study Rationale 
In the US, EU, and much of the world, laws, regulations, and guidances have been or are being put in place to increase availability of biological treatments by developing and licensing biosimilar products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1; EMEA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012; EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev.1 ; US FDA 2012a; US FDA 2012b).  A biosimilar 
product, generally, is one that is highly similar to a licensed biologic reference product, 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 21 of 77  
Confidential   and there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and reference 
products in terms of safety, purity, and pot ency.  Biosimilarity is demonstrated by the 
totality of the evidence, including quality, nonclinical, and clinical evidence.  The 
analytical and nonclinical similarity of ABP 798 and rituximab are summarized in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  The current study is designed to demonstrate the PK similarity and that there is no clinically meaningful difference between ABP 798 and rituximab in terms of safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity.

Confidential7 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
7.1 Primary Study Objective 
The primary objective for this study is to demonstrate PK similarity (as assessed 
principally by area under the serum concent ration-time curve [AUC] from time 0 
extrapolated to infinity [AUC inf] and the maximum observed  serum concentration [C max], 
following the 2nd infusion of 1st dose) of ABP 798 following 2 intravenous (IV) infusions of 
1000 mg each, relative to that of 2 IV infusions of 1000 mg each of rituximab (US) and of rituximab (EU). 
7.2 Secondary Study Objectives 
The secondary objectives are  
to demonstrate PK similarity between rituximab (US) and rituximab (EU) as
assessed by AUC inf and by C max after second infusion of the first dose
to assess the clinical efficacy of ABP 798 compared with rituximab
to assess the safety and immunogenicity of ABP 798 compared with rituximab.

Confidential   8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled 3-arm study in adult subjects with 
moderate to severe RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD s) (which must include intolerance or 
inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies).  Approximately 300 subjects (100 per treatment group) will be enrolled.  The subjects will be randomized to receive either 2 IV infusions of ABP 798, 1000 mg each, given 2 weeks apart (treatment group A), or 2 IV infusions of rituximab (US) 1000 mg each, given 2 weeks 
apart (treatment group B) or 2 IV infusions of rituximab (EU), 1000 mg each, given 2 
weeks apart (treatment group C), in a double-blinded fashion.  A total of 2 doses will be administered during the study; each dose consists of 2 infusions, 2 weeks apart. 
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will evaluate the safety data 
throughout the study, including an initial safety analysis after the first 18 subjects have 
been dosed (1000 mg x 2 infusions of either ABP 798 or rituximab [EU] or rituximab 
[US]).   
At week 24, the subjects in treatment groups A and C will continue with and receive the 
second dose of the same treatment, and the subjects in treatment group B will transition 
to become treatment group A1 and receive the second dose with ABP 798.  Retreatment 
may occur earlier, ie, anytime from week 16 to week 24 in individual subjects if necessary in the opinion of the Investigator. 
The end of study (EOS) will be at week 48  (or 24 weeks after the first infusion of the 
second dose for subjects retreated before week 24), and a final analysis will be 
performed when all subjects have completed or have had the opportunity to complete 
the week 48/EOS assessments.  Figure 1 is a summary of the study design.

8.2 Discussion of Study Design 
This study is randomized and double-blind to prevent bias in treatment allocation and in 
the subjective assessment of effect.   
8.3 Study Duration 
Subjects will receive investigational product (IP) first dose (2 infusions at days 1 and 15), followed by a second dose (2 infusions 2 weeks apart beginning at week 24 or earlier, ie, 
anytime from week 16 to week 24 in individual subjects if necessary in the opinion of the 
Investigator) with assessment until week 48 (or 24 weeks after the first infusion of the second dose for subjects retreated before week 24), plus a screening period of up to 4 weeks, for a total of up to 52 weeks.  A total of 2 doses will be administered during the study; each dose consists of 2 infusions, 2 weeks apart. 
Enrollment will continue until approximately 300 subjects have been randomized to 
treatment.  The end of trial will be the date when the last subject has completed  their last 
study assessment.

Confidential   8.4.3 Withdrawal and Replacement of Subjects 
8.4.3.1 Criteria for Subject Withdrawal 
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to future medical care by the physician or at the institution. 
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol required therapies or procedures at any 
time during the study, but continue participating in the study.  If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation from investigational product or other protocol required therapies and must discuss with 
the subject the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures 
(Table 1 ) and collection of data, including endpoints and AEs.  The Investigator must 
document the change to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and the level of follow-
up that is agreed to by the subject (eg, in person, by telephone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of 
the medical records).   
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol-required therapies or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study, and, where permitted, publicly available data 
can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The Investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.   
Reasons for removal from protocol-required investigational products or procedural 
assessments might include: 
 subject request to end IP administration 
 safety concern (eg, due to an AE, failure to follow contraception, and/or protocol 
requirements)  
 pregnancy 
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study might include: 
 withdrawal of consent from study 
 lost to follow-up  
 decision by Sponsor  
8.4.3.2 Evaluations at Withdrawal 
For any subject who is withdrawn before completing all study visits, the Investigator should: 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 29 of 77  
Confidential    Perform all the procedures scheduled for week 48/EOS.  The week 48/EOS 
assessments will be performed no later than 14 days after 
withdrawal/discontinuation (unless the subject withdraws consent to do so). 
 Complete all appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) screens, providing 
the date of and explanation for the subject’s withdrawal/discontinuation. 
 When indicated, arrange for appropriate follow up and/or alternative medical 
care for the discontinued subject.  
If the subject fails to attend a scheduled termination visit, there will be at least 2 attempts 
to contact the subject via telephone and 2 written communications.  If these receive no reply, the subject will be considered lost to follow up. 
8.4.3.3 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn will not be replaced.  However, sufficient subjects will be 
included to ensure the minimum sample size defined (see Section 12.2). 
8.5 Treatment 
8.5.1 Treatments Administered 
The Investigator must ensure that the investigational products will be used only in 
accordance with the protocol. 
Subjects will be randomly assigned at Baseline (day 1) to 1 of 3 treatment groups.  The 
first dose will be administered as follows: 
 Treatment A:  ABP 798 1000 mg IV on study days 1 and 15  
 Treatment B:  Rituximab (US) 1000 mg IV on study days 1 and 15  
 Treatment C:  Rituximab (EU) 1000 mg IV on study days 1 and 15  
At week 24, the subjects in treatment groups A and C will continue with and receive the 
second dose with the same treatment (ABP 798 1000 mg x 2 and rituximab (EU) 
1000 mg x 2, respectively), and the subjects in treatment group B will transition to 
treatment group A1 and receive the second dose of ABP 798 1000 mg x 2.  Retreatment may occur earlier, ie, anytime from week 16 to week 24 in individual subjects, if necessary in the opinion of the Investigator.  The EOS will be at week 48 (or 24 weeks 
after the first infusion of the second dose for subjects retreated before week 24).  A total 
of 2 doses will be administered during the study; each dose will consist of 2 infusions. 
No dose reductions or changes will be allowed.   ABP 798/rituximab will be administered after all other procedures are completed for each 
visit.  Investigational product will be administered only as an IV infusion by a healthcare 
professional with appropriate medical support to manage severe infusion reactions.  Do

Confidential   storage and expiration information (where required) provided on the label that is affixed 
to the package containing the investigational product.  Do not freeze or shake. 
8.5.5.2 Study Treatm ent Accountability 
All supplies of study medication will be accounted for in accordance with GCP.  There 
will be an investigational product accountability record and the pharmacist, or designee, 
should maintain accurate records of the disposition of all study medication supplies received during the study.  These records should include the amounts and dates that clinical drug supplies were received and destroyed/returned to Amgen or its designee.  If 
errors or damages in the clinical drug supply shipments occur, the Investigator should 
contact Amgen or its designee immediately.  Copies of the study medication accountability records will be provided by each Investigator for inclusion in the Trial Master File after database lock.  The study monitor will periodically check the supplies of study medication held by the Investigator or pharmacist to verify accountability of all 
medication used. 
The Investigator will administer the medication only to the identified subjects of this 
study, according to the procedures described in this study protocol.  After the end of the study, all unused medication and all medication containers should be destroyed or 
returned to Amgen or its designee, as appropriate, for destruction.  In either instance, 
complete documentation will be returned to the Sponsor. 
8.5.6 Dose Adjustment s and Dose Escalation 
There are no recommended dose reductions or escalations for the investigational products (ABP 798 or rituximab).   
All AEs should be reported in accordance with Section 11 of the protocol. 
8.5.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
8.5.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Treat ments (Medications and Therapies) 
The following concomitant medications are permitted: 
 MTX as specified in Section 8.5.1.   
 Oral corticosteroids at a dose of ≤  10 mg prednisone, or equivalent, per day are 
permitted provided they are at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment.  The dose of oral corticosteroids may be reduced according to local guidelines during the conduct of the study. 
If at any time a subject needs additional t herapy (other than those specified in 
Section 8.5.7.3), including an increase in their MTX dose, to treat their RA, the 
Investigator should contact the Amgen Medical Monitor (or designee) to determine if the 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 33 of 77  
Confidential   subject is eligible to remain on study treatment.  If the subject is no longer eligible to 
remain on study treatment, then the subject should undergo the assessments of the week 48/EOS visit before administration of any additional therapies.  The subject should 
be withdrawn from the study treatment. 
8.5.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
All of the following are prohibited at any time during the study: 
 Non-biologic DMARDs (other than MTX; as per exclusion criteria) including 
tofacitinib 
 Any biologic treatment for RA (eg, anakinra, soluble IL-1 type II receptor, 
etanercept, infliximab, abatacept, tociliz umab, golimumab, certolizumab, or 
adalimumab) 
 Chronic minocycline or tetracycline (except use for ≤ 10 days to treat infection, 
or for nonarthritis indications, eg, acne), hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate 
mofetil, or sulfasalazine 
 Live and attenuated vaccinations are not allowed while subjects are enrolled in 
the study and receiving investigational product. 
 Any experimental (biological or nonbiological) therapy (within or outside a clinical 
study). 
 IA hyaluronic acid 
 IA, IM, or IV corticosteroids including adrenocorticotropic hormone (except of 
use as pre-medication) 
8.5.7.3 Rescue Medication 
The definition of rescue medication is any medication other than prohibited medication 
that is used to treat RA.  The use of rescue medication is allowed in this study under following conditions: 
 Oral corticosteroids:  Maximum dose allowed is 10 mg prednisone (or 
equivalent) per day; dose can be decreased if needed, per Investigator’s clinical 
judgment. 
 Acetaminophen, hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol, and/or propoxyphene may be 
used by the subject as rescue analgesics except at least 12 hours before a scheduled study efficacy evaluation (week 8, 12, 24, 40, and 48/EOS).  
 NSAIDs/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Inhibitors:  If the subject enters the study 
taking an NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor, the dose of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors can be reduced or discontinued during the study if necessary for safety reasons or standard of care.  In cases of flare, the dose of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors can be 
temporarily increased as needed.  However, the subject must return to the 
maintenance dose (the dose at baseline) as soon as the flare resolves.  In subjects not taking an NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor, one such treatment may be added temporarily to treat a flare in RA.  It should be tapered and discontinued with resolution of flare.  In all cases, any dose regimen higher than baseline dose is not allowed at least 12 hours before the clinical efficacy assessments 
(week 8, 12, 24, 40, and 48/EOS).

Confidential   This number will not necessarily be the same  as the randomization number assigned for 
the study. 
Upon completion of screening, the Investigator (or designee) will contact the IXRS to 
randomize the subject centrally to receive either ABP 798, rituximab (US), or rituximab 
(EU) in a 1:1:1 manner.  The randomization will be stratified by geographic region, seropositivity (RF positive and/or CCP-positive vs. RF-negative and CCP-negative), and number of prior biologic therapies used for RA (1 vs. >1).  
8.5.10 Unblinding Procedures 
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study.  Unblinding at the study site for any other r eason will be considered a protocol deviation.  
The Investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Medical Monitor (or designee) before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 
1 working day after the event. 
The identity of investigational product assigned to subject numbers or to individual boxes 
of investigational product will be available for emergency situations through the IXRS.  Authorized site staff will be provided with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) 
to access the IXRS to obtain unblinding information.  This PIN is unique to the individual 
and must not be shared.

Confidential   8.6.1.2 Efficacy Measurements 
8.6.1.2.1 Efficacy Criteria 
Efficacy is a secondary objective in this study.  The efficacy endpoint is Disease Activity 
Score (DAS) 28-CRP change from baseline at week 24.  The endpoint will also be assessed at weeks 8, 12, 40, and 48.   
In addition, ACR20 (20% improvement in A CR core set measurements), ACR50 (at least 
50% improvement compared to baseline)  and ACR70 (at least 70% improvement 
compared to baseline) will also be assessed at weeks 8, 12, 24, 40, and 48.  
DAS28-CRP  
The DAS28-CRP is a continuous measure based on 28 DAS joints from the ACR 
(indicated with * in Section 17.3), the Subject's Global Health Assessment score (as 
assessed as a score of 0 to 100 transformed from the results on a 100-mm VAS scale), and CRP, as follows:  
DAS28-CRP = 0.56*(TJC28)0.5 + 0.28*(SJC28) 0.5 + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*GH + 0.96  
where TJC28 is the tender joint count of the 28 joints in the DAS, SJC28 is the 28 swollen joint count, CRP is in mg/L, and GH is the Subject's Global Health Assessment in 0 to 100 scale ( van Gestel et al, 1998 ).  
ACR 
Improvement compared to baseline is requi red for both swollen and tender joint counts 
(66/68 joint counts; Section 17.3), as well as for 3 out of the following 5 additional 
parameters:  
 Subject's Global Health Assessment (on a 100-mm visual analogue scale [VAS]; 
Section 17.4 ) 
 Investigator's Global Health Assessment (on a 100-mm VAS; Section 17.4) 
 Subject's assessment of pain (on a 100-mm VAS; Section 17.4) 
 Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI; Section 17.4) 
 CRP  
8.6.1.3 Safety Measurements 
Safety endpoints include the following: 
 treatment-emergent AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
 clinically significant changes in laboratory values and vital signs  
 incidence of antidrug antibodies

visits on days 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, and 17 and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 26, 30, 40, and 48/EOS.  After the first 18 subjects have received at least 1 dose of investigational product (ie, 
infusions on days 1 and 15) an initial safety  analysis will be conducted by the DMC.   
9.1 Screening 
After subjects have provided informed consent, the following assessments/procedures 
will be performed within the 28 day screening period: 
 targeted medical history, including history of all prior treatments for RA within the 
past 3 years and any prior biologic therapies used for RA 
 physical examination, including eval uation of body systems and height and 
weight 
 vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and 
temperature)  
 standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
 chest radiography (prior radiography or fo rmal reports signed off by a radiologist 
within 3 months of first dose of investigational product is acceptable) 
 screening joint assessments (DAS and ACR tender/swollen joint counts; 
Section 17.3 )  
 tuberculosis testing (PPD or Quantiferon test)  
 clinical laboratory testing, including serology, serum chemistry, hematology, 
either CRP or ESR, anti-CCP, and rheumatoid factor.  
 collection of samples for urinalysis 
 serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential 
At the screening assessment, all concomitant  medications from 3 months before the 
planned start of study treatment, all prior treatments for RA within the past 3 years and any prior biologic therapies used for RA will be recorded.  Any AEs occurring during the 
screening period will be recorded as medical history; any SAEs will be recorded using 
the eCRF.  SAEs will be reported as outlined in Section 11.2.2. 
Subjects will continue on their stable pre-study MTX regimen during the screening period. 
9.1.1 Screen Failures 
Subjects determined to be screen failures will not be eligible for immediate participation 
and must be registered as a screen failure in IXRS.  Laboratory assessments used to 
determine subject eligibility may be repeated during the screening period before the subject is considered a screen failure.  Screen failed subjects may be re-screened up to 2 times at the Investigator’s discretion (ie, a total of 3 screens including initial screening).  
The subject will retain the same subject ID number provided at the initial screening.

Confidential   10 METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 
10.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis Assessments 
At each time point for RA assessments, the Subject's Global Health Assessment, 
subject's assessment of pain, and HAQ-DI (Section 17.4) will be completed.  These 
assessments should be the first assessments performed at the visits at which they are 
scheduled.   
At these same time points, joints will be assessed and classified as swollen/not swollen 
and tender/not tender by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination.  Joint prosthesis, arthrodesis, or fused joints will not be assessed for swelling or tenderness.  
The joints to be assessed for swelling and tenderness are given in Section 17.3, 
including the 28 joint-count for DAS and the 66/68 joint set for ACR.  All joint 
assessments will be performed by an experienc ed joint evaluator.  The evaluator cannot 
be the treating physician and cannot interact with the subject on the study beyond the assessment of joints.  The evaluator should not discuss the subject’s clinical status, nor 
should the evaluator have access to subject medical records or eCRFs, including prior 
joint assessments.  The same evaluator should perform joint assessments across all time points for a subject where possible. 
For the screening and baseline joint counts, the distal interphalanges should be 
evaluated, but should not be included in the total joint count to determine eligibility. 
The Investigator's Global Health Assessment will also be completed at the times 
indicated in Table 1.  The independent joint assessor may not complete the 
Investigator’s Global Disease Assessment.  The physician completing the Investigator’s Global Disease Assessment will have access to the joint assessments.  The subject and 
physician must complete the global assessments independently from each other. 
10.2 Pregnancy Test 
Pregnancy will be determined by evaluation of -human chorionic gonadotrophin 
(-HCG) in serum at screening by central laboratory and in urine at subsequent time 
points locally for all women of childbearing potential.  Subjects who are pregnant are 
excluded from the study. 
The Investigator will inform the Sponsor immediately of any case of pregnancy and 
collect information on any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating in 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 48 of 77 
Confidential   this study and in case of pregnancy among female partners of male subjects.  The 
subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
10.3 Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will be performed by a physician and will include examination of 
the following:  general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, skin, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, abdominal system and nervous system.  For 
each body system an assessment of normal or  abnormal will be recorded.  Clinically 
relevant changes from baseline will be reported as AEs. 
Body weight (kg) will be measured without shoes or jacket.  Height will be determined at 
screening. 
10.4 Vital Signs  
Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure will be measured on the same arm (preferentially on the left arm) after the subject has been in a supine/sitting position for 5 minutes.  Pulse will be recorded simultaneously with blood pressure measurements.  
Respiration rate and temperature will also be recorded. 
During the study, measurement of vital signs may be repeated at the discretion of the 
Investigator for safety reasons.  Clinically relevant abnormal findings will be reported as AEs. 
10.5 Electrocardiogram 
Computerized 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained after the subject has been supine for 5 minutes.  Each lead will be recorded for at least 3 to 5 beats at a speed of 25 mm/sec paper speed and 10 mm/mV amplitude.  At a minimum, heart rate, P, PR, QRS, and QT will be recorded from the 12-lead ECG.  A copy of the ECGs will be retained on site.  For the purposes of screening, the Investigator or a designee will 
evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and whether it is clinically acceptable 
for inclusion, if abnormal.   
10.6 Tuberculosis Testing 
A tuberculosis test will be performed at screening by PPD or Quantiferon test.  PPD tests will be performed locally, and Quantiferon tests will be performed by the central or 
local laboratory.  Subjects with positive PPD/Quantiferon test may be eligible based on 
the Sponsor’s tuberculosis risk assessment wo rksheet and the other criteria listed in 
Inclusion Criterion 13. 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 49 of 77 
Confidential   10.7 Chest Radiography  
Chest radiography will be performed at screening as indicated in Table 1  and will include 
anterior/posterior or posterior/anterior and lateral views.  Chest x-ray performed at the 
site can be read by the Investigator.  A formal report, signed off by the Investigator, 
should be filed in subject’s medical records.  If the x-ray is performed off site, then formal 
reports signed off by a radiologist should be acceptable.  Historical films obtained, or formal reports signed off by a radiologist within the 3 months prior to receiving investigational product are acceptable for screening as well. 
10.8 Clinical Laboratory Testing 
Venous blood samples will be taken for clinical laboratory tests at the time points indicated in Table 1.  The following parameters will be determined: 
Serology:  HbsAg, anti-HBc, and HCV antibody 
Hematology:   Hemoglobin, hematocrit or packed cell volume, red blood cell count, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, white blood 
cell count and differential, platelet count. 
Clinical chemistry:  Sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, total 
bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, nonfasting glucose, phosphate, and uric acid.  Rheumatoid Factor and anti-CCP will be assessed at 
screening.  CRP will be assessed at the time points indicated in Table 1 .  CRP results 
from the baseline visit and onwards will be blinded  to study sites and not included in the 
central laboratory report to the site. 
Urinalysis (fresh urine):   pH, protein, glucose, bilirubin, blood. 
Immunology:  Blood samples for antidrug antibody assessments will be collected at the 
time points indicated in Table 1. 
The above clinical laboratory tests will be sent to and assessed at a central laboratory, 
except urine pregnancy, which will be assessed locally, and immunology, which will be sent to central laboratory and analyzed by Amgen or a designee.  Further details of the 
procedures to be followed for sample collection, storage, and shipment will be 
documented in a Laboratory Manual. 
Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will also be tested for neutralizing 
antibodies and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity, and

antidrug antibodies during the study. 
Additional and repeat laboratory safety testing may be performed at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  Any clinically relevant c hanges from baseline will be reported as AEs. 
IgA, IgG, and IgM levels will also be collected, as indicated in Table 1.  
10.9 Blood Samples for Pha rmacokinetic Analysis  
During treatment, a series of serum samples will be taken according to Table 1 .  The 
exact times of blood sampling will be recorded.  
Blood sampling for PK analysis during each return visit, including the EOS visit, will 
occur per the scheduled time point with tolerance collection windows as follows: 
 predose day 1 = within 1 hour prior to dosing  
 days 1 and 15 at EOI - infusion should be monitored to ensure collection of the 
PK sample within 10 minutes after the end of the infusion 
 all other day 1 sampling times = ± 10 minutes 
 days 2 and 3 = ± 3 hours 
 predose day 15 = within 1 hour prior to dosing 
 all other day 15 sampling time = ± 10 minutes 
 days 16 and 17 = ± 3 hours 
 weeks 4, 8, and 12 = ± 2 days 
 predose at weeks 24 and 26 = within 1 hour prior to dosing 
 weeks 30 and 48 = ± 2 days

Confidential   11 SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING 
11.1 Adverse Events 
11.1.1 Definition of  Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  The 
event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that any AEs observed by the Investigator or 
reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record as well as the 
eCRF.   
The definition of AEs includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  Worsening 
indicates that the pre-existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, 
gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association 
with a significantly worse outcome.  In the case of worsening of a pre-existing condition, the start date of the event is the date when the first signs of worsening were observed.  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic sur gery or a medical procedure while on study is 
not considered an AE.   
11.1.2 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject that occur from the day of randomization until the week 48 visit (or through 28 days after the last dose of investigational product for subjects who discontinue study early) are reported using the applicable eCRF Adverse Event 
Summary page.  AEs observed by the Investigat or or reported by the subject that occur 
after signing of informed consent but before randomization will  be recorded.  
The Investigator must assign the following AE attributes: 
 AE diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms) 
 dates of onset and resolution 
 severity  
 assessment of relatedness to IP  
 action taken 
AEs must be graded for severity according to the National Cancer Institute (US) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ ctc.htm).   
The Investigator must assess whether the AE is possibly related to the investigational 
product.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 52 of 77 
Confidential   there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the 
investigational product?” 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as AEs.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or 
adjustment in current therapy are considered AEs.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae 
(not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the AE. 
The Investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an AE.  A subject, or subject’s legal guardian, can also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an AE.  If the subject withdraws consent, the 
subject is encouraged to undergo, at a minimum, an EOS assessment.   
11.2 Serious Adverse Events 
11.2.1 Definition of Se rious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria: 
 fatal 
 life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 other medically important serious event 
An AE would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event necessitated an 
admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an Investigator considers an event to be clin ically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be cl assified as a SAE under the criterion of “other 
medically important serious event.”  Examples of such events could include allergic 
bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug induced liver injury, or events that 
necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention. 
11.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAEs observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the ICF through the week 48 visit (or 28 days after the last dose of investigational product for subjects who discontinue early) are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen.   
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 53 of 77 
Confidential   The SAE must be submitted to Amgen, or its designee, within 24 hours following the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable eCRF.   
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is not functional, the SAE can be reported by 
faxing a completed paper SAE Fax Cover Sheet and SAE report form or by direct 
telephone communication with PRA Safety Risk Management at the numbers provided below.  The event must be updated electronically in EDC by the clinical site once the EDC function resumes. 
Fax information to Safety Risk Management/ PRA, for the attention of:

FAX:  1.888.772.6919 Phone:  1.800.772.2215 CHOSafety@praintl.com 
New information relating to a previously reported SAE must be submitted to Amgen, or 
its designee.  All new information for SAEs must be sent to Amgen, or its designee, within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  The Investigator may be 
asked to provide additional follow-up information, which may include a discharge 
summary or extracts from the medical reco rd.  Information provided about the SAE must 
be consistent with that recorded on the applicable eCRF (eg, AE Summary eCRF). 
Elective hospitalizations are not considered SAEs.  If a subject is permanently withdrawn 
from protocol-required therapies because of a SAE, this information must be submitted 
to Amgen, or its designee. 
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for SAEs, the treatment assignment of 
subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related AEs may be unblinded by Amgen, or its designee, before submission to regulatory authorities.  Investigators will 
receive notification of related SAE reports sent to regulatory authorities in accordance 
with local requirements.   
Determination of expectedness for Amgen products will be based on the contents of the 
Investigator’s Brochure for investigational products and the regional prescribing 
information for products being studied for an approved use.  Expectedness assessments 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 54 of 77 
Confidential   are to be made for all investigational products (Amgen and non-Amgen) using the 
appropriate reference safety information per local regulatory reporting requirements.  Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) reported for subjects 
receiving a non-Amgen investigational products are to be expedited according to local 
requirements.  
Amgen, or its designee, reports SAEs and/or SUSARs as required to regulatory 
authorities, Investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting 
requirements according to local regulations and GCPs.  
The Investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of SAEs occurring at the site and 
other AE reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures and statutes. 
After the protocol-required reporting period defined above, the Investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for SAEs.  However, if the Investigator becomes aware 
of an SAE after this protocol-required reporting period, the Investigator will report the event to Amgen within 24 hours following the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  SAEs reported outside of the protocol-required reporting period will be captured within 
the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.   
11.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AEs of Special Interest for ABP 798/rituximab will be defined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) and analyzed from the clinical database.  There are no expedited reporting requirements for AEs of Special Interest (other than those that meet other reporting requirements). 
11.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and 
documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous 
miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to Amgen, or its designee.

Confidential   12 DATA MANAGEMENT AND ST ATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
The data management and statistical analysis of this study will be performed by an 
external clinical research organization (CRO) PRA. 
12.1 Data Management 
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the latest available World 
Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference Di ctionary.  Coexistent diseases and AEs 
will be coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). 
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked. 
12.2 Sample Size Estimation 
Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive ABP 798, 
rituximab (US), or rituximab (EU), stratified by geographic region, seropositivity 
(RF-positive and/or CCP-positive vs. RF -negative and CCP-negative), and number of 
prior biologic  therapies used for RA (1 vs. > 1).  The sample size will provide > 90% 
power to demonstrate similarity on the primary PK endpoints based on an assumption of between-subject variability (as measured by coefficient of variation) of 40%, true 
geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1 among ABP 798, rituximab (US), or rituximab (EU), a 
margin of (0.8, 1.25) and 15% dropout by week 24.  The PK similarity will be tested between ABP 798 versus rituximab (US) and ABP 798 versus rituximab (EU), each with a significance level of 0.05.  The similarity  between rituximab (US) and rituximab (EU) 
will be evaluated as well. 
12.3 Statistical Analysis Plan 
A SAP will be written and finalized prior to any lock of the study database.  The SAP will provide a detailed description of the statistical methods and expand on the details provided in the protocol.  Additional analyses may be added.  Table, listing, and figure shells will also be included. 
12.4 Randomization 
Randomization will be performed by an IX RS.  The randomization schedule will be 
prepared by a statistician not involved in t he conduct of the study.  Randomization will be 
stratified by geographic region, seropositivity (RF-positive and/or CCP-positive vs. RF-negative and CCP-negative), and number of prior biologic  therapies used for RA (1 vs. 
> 1).

Confidential   12.6.4 Pharmacokinetics 
The PK similarity will be demonstrated by compar ing the 90% confidence interval (CI) for 
the GMR of test (ABP 798)-to-reference (US-licensed rituximab or EU-authorized 
rituximab) and rituximab [US] to rituximab [EU]  for AUC inf and for  Cmax following the 
second infusion of the first dose with the bounds of 0.8 to 1.25, where =0.05.  PK 
parameters will be calculated using non-compartmental methods.  Point estimates and 
CIs for the GMR will be estimated from an analysis of covariance model using the PK Analysis Set. 
Other PK endpoints, AUC
0-14 day  after first infusion, AUC 0-12 wk  after the first and second 
infusions of the first dose and C max after the first infusion of the first dose, will be 
analyzed using the same methods as stated above.   Additional PK parameters including 
the time of C max (tmax), terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), and the terminal elimination rate 
constant (λ z) will be summarized descriptively. 
12.6.5 Pharmacodynamics 
The PD similarity will be evaluated descriptively  by calculating the 90% CI of complete 
CD19+ cell depletion rate difference between test-to-reference.  The 95% CI will also be 
provided.  The point estimate and CIs for rate difference will be estimated using a generalized linear model (specifically, a log-binomial regression model) with relevant baseline values and stratification factors as covariates using the FAS. 
12.6.6 Efficacy 
Clinical equivalence will be evaluated for DAS28-CRP at week 24 using the FAS 
consisting of all randomized subjects.  If PK similarity is established between 
rituximab (US) and rituximab (EU), the 2 arms will be combined into a single 
reference arm for the primary assessment of clinical equivalence between ABP 798 and rituximab.  The results for ABP 798 vs. rituximab (EU) and ABP 798 vs. 
rituximab (US) will be provided for descriptive purposes. If PK similarity is not 
established, the ABP 798 arm will be compared to each of the individual rituximab arms separately to  stablish clinical equivalence of ABP 798 to the individual reference arms. The 95% CI for both the difference between ABP 798 and US-licensed rituximab or EU-authorized rituximab in DAS28-CRP change from baseline will also be 
provided. 
With the planned sample size, there is 94%  probability that the 90% CI of the 
difference between the ABP 798 arm and the pooled rituximab (rituximab [EU] and 
Product: ABP 798 
Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 60 of 77 
Confidential   rituximab [US]) arm and 83% probability that the 90% CI of the difference between test 
(ABP 798) and reference (US-licensed rituximab or EU-authorized rituximab) in 
DAS28-CRP change from baseline at week 24 will fall into the equivalence margin of ± 
0.6 (EULAR response criteria), assuming a standard deviation of 1.4 ( Volkmann et al, 
2010).  DAS28-CRP at other timepoints and ACR 20, 50 and 70 will be summarized 
descriptively.   
In addition, 90% and 95% CI for the risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) of ACR20, 
ACR50  and ACR70 at week 24 between ABP 798 and rituximab (pooled US- licensed  
and EU-authorized rituximab , US-licensed rituximab or EU-authorized rituximab) will 
also be provided and the outcome is descriptive.  The CIs for the difference of DAS28-
CRP change from baseline between the ABP 798 and rituximab arms will be est imated 
using repeated-measures analysis.  Data from all assessed time points through week 24 visit will be included in the analysis.  Besides stratification variables, visit (week), 
treatment, and treatment-by-visit interaction will be included in the model, with visit as a categorical variable.  The CIs for RR and RD of ACR20 /50/70 between ABP 798 and 
rituximab arms will be estimated based on a repeated measures analysis where data 
from all assessed time points through week 24 visit are included.  Besides stratification 
variables, visit week (as a categorical variable), treatment, and treatment-by-visit interaction will be included in the generalized estimating equation (GEE) model.   
Other endpoints, RR and RD of ACR 20/ 50/70 at weeks 8, 12, 40, and 48, and RR and 
RD of ACR50 and ACR70 at weeks 8, 12, 40, and 48 will be summarized descriptively 
by treatment.  In addition, the difference of DAS28-CRP change from baseline between 
the ABP 798 and rituximab arms will be summarized descriptively by treatment at weeks 8, 12, 40, and 48. 
12.6.7 Safety 
All safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set based on subject’s 
actual treatment received.  Safety analysis will include analyses of AEs, clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs, and antidrug antibodies.  In general, summaries will be provided separately for day 1 up to the 1
st infusion of the 2nd dose of investigational 
product by actual treatment groups, for the entire study by treatment groups defined by 
first dose, and for the day of the 1st infusion of the 2nd dose of investigational product up 
to the week 48/EOS visit with subjects grouped as receiving ABP 798 for both 1st and 2nd 
doses, receiving rituximab (US) for the 1st dose and ABP 798 for the 2nd dose, and 
receiving rituximab (EU) for both 1st and 2nd doses, unless otherwise specified.

For the investigational product (ABP 798, rituximab [US], or rituximab [EU]), summary 
statistics will be provided for the total number of doses.   
12.6.7.2 Adverse Events 
Safety analyses will focus on treatment-emergent AEs.  Treatment-emergent events are 
those that begin or increase in severity or frequency at or after the time of first treatment 
up to the week 48/EOS visit (or within 28 days following the last dose of study treatment 
if subject discontinues study early).  All treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by 
treatment arm and according to the MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
term.  Summaries will be provided for the incidence of all treatment-emergent AEs and 
by severity and relatedness to investigational product.  Additional summaries will be presented for SAEs. 
All AE data will be listed by subject, and a separate listing will include all SAEs, including 
any deaths on study. 
AEs of special interest ( Section 11.3 ) will be summarized separately.   
The exposure adjusted subject incidence rates of adverse events throughout the study 
may be tabulated for selected categories of adverse events
. 
12.6.7.3 Immunogenicity 
The number and percentage of subjects developing antidrug antibodies and those 
developing neutralizing antibodies will be tabulated separately for day 1 to the 1st 
infusion of the 2nd dose of investigational product by actual treatment groups, and for 
day 1 of first infusion of second dose to 4 weeks after the 2nd infusion of the 2nd dose and 
for the entire study by treatment groups defined by first dose.  
12.6.7.4 Concomitant Medications and Therapies 
Concomitant medications will be coded by WHODRUG and will be summarized by treatment group with number and percentage of subjects receiving each category of 
medication. 
12.6.7.5 Clinical Laboratory Test

Vital sign data (observed and change from baseline) will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by time point and treatment.   
Abnormal findings from physical examinations will be listed by subject and assessed for 
clinical significance, which will be included in the AE listings and summaries. 
12.6.8 Interim Analysis 
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. 
12.6.9 Data Monitoring Committee 
A DMC external to Amgen and PRA will be formed with members consisting of 
individuals chosen for their expertise in r heumatology.  Members of the DMC will include 
at a minimum, physicians external to Amgen and PRA, and appropriate statistical representation external to Amgen and PRA.  The primary role of this independent DMC will be to monitor safety data.  
The DMC will review unblinded safety data at regular intervals, as outlined in the DMC 
charter (approximately twice yearly; the st art date will depend on subject accrual rates). 
In addition, the DMC will conduct an initial safety analysis after the first 18 subjects have received at least 1 dose of investigational  product (ie, infusions on days 1 and 15) of 
either ABP 798, rituximab (US) or rituximab (EU).   
The DMC will communicate major safety concerns and recommendations regarding 
study modification or termination to Amgen management at any time during the conduct 
of the study.  
Records of all meetings will be archived.  Selected Amgen, or its designee, staff may 
serve as liaisons to the external DMC, but will not be voting members and will not be unblinded to the results.  Details regarding the DMC will be provided in the DMC charter.

Confidential   13 MONITORING PROCEDURES (QUALITY ASSURANCE) 
Amgen has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to conduct this study in accordance 
with established research principles and ICH GCP guidelines.  As such, in order to fulfill these obligations and to maintain current of study progress, Amgen monitors, or 
Amgen’s designees, will visit the investigative sites during study conduct, in addition to 
maintaining telephone and written communication.  On-site visits, telephone calls, and regular inspection of the eCRFs will be conducted in order to assess subject enrollment, compliance with protocol procedures, completeness and accuracy of data entered on the 
eCRFs, verification of eCRF data against original source documents, and occurrence of 
AEs.  The Investigator must provide the monitor with full access to all source and study documents. 
13.1 Routine Monitoring 
Amgen, or its designee, assigned monitors will conduct regular site visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring various aspects of the study.  The 
Investigator must agree to Amgen, or its designee, authorized personnel having direct 
access to the clinical (or associated) files and clinical study supplies (dispensing and storage areas) for all study subjects cons idered for study entry for the purpose of 
verifying entries made in the eCRF, and assist with their activities, if requested.  
Adequate time and space for monitoring visits should be made available by the 
Investigator. 
The site must complete the eCRFs in a timely manner and on an ongoing basis to allow 
regular review by the study monitor. 
Whenever a subject name is revealed on a document that is to be collected for the 
Sponsor, the name must be blacked out permanently by the site personnel, leaving the 
initials visible, and must be annotated with the subject number as identification. 
13.2 Inspections and Auditing Procedures 
Amgen, or its designee, may conduct audits at the investigative sites, including, but not limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, 
and comparison of eCRFs with source documents.  All medical records (progress notes) 
must be available for audit.  The Investigator agrees to participate with audits conducted at a convenient time in a reasonable manner. 
Government regulatory authorities may also inspect the Investigator during or after the 
study.  The Investigator or designee should contact Amgen, or its designee, immediately

Confidential   14 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND MATERIALS 
14.1 Electronic Case Report Forms 
An eCRF will be used to store and transmit subject information.  The file structure and 
format for the eCRF will be provided by the Sponsor or their representative and should be handled in accordance with the instructions provided. 
The eCRF must be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the Investigator. 
Access to the eCRF will be strictly password protected and limited to personnel directly 
participating in the study.  Data should be entered into the eCRF completely by examining personnel or the appropriate site staff.  The eCRF must be completed as 
soon as possible after any subject evaluation or communication.  If data are to be 
changed due to erroneous input or other reason, an electronic audit trail will track these changes.  The eCRFs and computers that store them must be accessible to study monitors and other regulatory auditors. 
14.2 Data Collection 
During each study visit, a physician participating in the study will maintain progress 
notes in the subject’s medical records to document all significant observations.  At a 
minimum, these notes will contain: 
 the date of the visit and the corresponding day or visit in the study schedule (eg, 
screening, day 1, week 2, etc). 
 general condition and status remarks by the subject, including any significant 
medical findings.  The severity, frequency, duration, and resolution of any 
reported AE, and the Investigator's assessment as to whether or not the reported AE is investigational product-related. 
 changes in concomitant medications or dosages. 
 a general reference to the procedures completed. 
 the signature or initials of all physicians making an entry in the medical record 
(progress notes). 
In addition, any contact with the subject via telephone or other means that provides 
significant clinical information will also be documented in the medical record (progress notes), as described above.  
Information from the medical records (progress notes) and other source documents will 
be promptly transcribed to the appropriate section of the eCRF. 
Changes to information in the medical record (progress notes), CRF, and other source 
documents will be initialed and dated on the day the change is made by the Investigator

Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 66 of 77 
Confidential   or designee.  If the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the 
change will be written adjacent to the change. 
14.3 Source Documents Maintenance 
Source documents contain the results of origin al observations and activities of a clinical 
investigation.  Source documents include, but are not limited to, medical records (progress notes), computer printouts, screening logs and recorded data from automated instruments.  
All source documents from this study will be maintained by the Investigator and made 
available for inspection by authorized persons.  The original signed informed consent for 
each subject shall be filed with records kept by the Investigator and a copy shall be given to the subject. 
14.4 Record Maintenance 
All data derived from the study will remain the property of Amgen Inc. 
Records must be retained in accordance with the current ICH Guidelines on GCP.  All 
essential study documents including records of subjects, source documents, eCRFs and 
investigational product inventory must be kept on file. 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region, or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational products.  However, essential documents may be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the Sponsor.   
The Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and accurate hard 
copy source documents of all observations and data generated during this study.  Such 
documentation is subject to inspection by the Sponsor, its representatives, and regulatory authorities. 
If an Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for 
maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept 
responsibility.  Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed by the Sponsor.

Confidential   14.5 Confidentiality 
All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subject’s 
state of health will be regarded as confidential.  For disclosure of any such information, an agreement will be obtained in writing.  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity is maintained.  On eCRFs 
and other documents submitted to the Sponsor or the CRO, subjects must not be identified by name.  Instead, subjects will only be known by the unique subject number allocated to them in order to ensure confidentiality on all study documentation.  Subjects 
will retain this unique number throughout the study.  The Investigator will keep a 
separate log of these codes. 
In order to comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure subject safety, it 
may be necessary for the Sponsor and its representative, the CRO personnel, the local research review board, or the US FDA to review subjects’ medical records as they relate 
to this study.  Only the subject’s unique number on the eCRFs will identify him/her, but 
their full names may be made known to a drug regulatory authority or other authorized government or health care officials, if necessary, and to personnel designated by the 
Sponsor. 
Documents that are not for submission to t he Sponsor or the CRO (eg, consent forms) 
will be maintained by the Investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary 
to allow monitoring by the Sponsor and the CRO, and auditing by regulatory authorities.  No documents identifying subjects by name will leave the investigative site and subject identity will remain confidential in all publications related to the study.

Confidential   15 ADMINISTRATION PROCEDURES 
15.1 Regulatory Approval 
Amgen Inc., or their appointed agents, will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
regulatory authority approvals are obtained, according to local country requirements. 
No subject may enter the study until this approval has been obtained.  A copy of the 
approval (where one is provided as requested, according to local country requirements) 
will be provided to the Investigator and to the IRB(s)/IEC(s). 
15.2 Protocol Amendments 
In accordance with ICH Topic E 6 (R1) Guideline for GCP the Investigator should not implement any deviation from or changes of  the protocol without agreement by the 
Sponsor and documented approval from the IRB /IECs of a protocol amendment, except 
where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in monitor[s], change of telephone number[s]).  
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment.  Any potential 
amendment must be approved by the Sponsor.  A written amendment must be 
submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IRB/IECs assuming this responsibility.  The Investigator must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before implementing the changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects.  In these cases, the IRB/IEC must be notified within 
5 days of the change. 
All amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by both the appropriate 
regulatory authorities and the IRB/IEC, exc ept for administrative amendments, which 
require notification but not written approval.  Once approved, the protocol amendment 
will be distributed to all recipients of the original protocol, with instructions to append the 
amendment to the protocol. 
If, in the judgment of the local IRB/IEC, the Investigator and/or Sponsor, the protocol 
amendment alters the study design or procedures and/or increases the potential risk to 
the subject, the currently approved written ICF will require modification.  The modified 
ICF must also be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor, appropriate regulatory authorities, and the IRB/IEC.  In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained from subjects enrolled in the study before participation continues.

Clinical Study Protocol: 20130108 Date: 20 March 2018 Page 69 of 77 
Confidential   15.3 Protocol Adherence and Deviations 
The protocol must be read thoroughly, and the instructions must be followed.  However, 
exceptions will be made in emergency sit uations when the protection, safety, and 
well-being of the subject requires immediate intervention based on the judgment of the 
Investigator or (a) responsible, appropriately trained, and credentialed professional(s) 
designated by the Investigator as a sub-investigator.  
In the event of a significant protocol deviation due to an emergency, accident, or error, 
the Investigator or designee must contact the Medical Monitor at the earliest possible 
time by telephone.  This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to whether or 
not the subject should continue in the study.  The Investigator, Sponsor, and Medical Monitor will document this decision. 
15.4 Publication Policy 
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors), which states: 
 Authorship credit is to be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception 
and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting 
the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final 
approval of the version to be published; 4) agreement to be accountable for all 
aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors are to meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
 When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group is to identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals are to fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. 
 Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
 All persons designated as authors are to qualify for authorship, and all those 
who qualify are to be listed. 
 Each author is to have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial Agreement between the institution, Investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.

17.4 Appendix 4: Subjective Assessment Scales 
Subject's Assessment of Disease Related Pain: 
The subject's assessment of their current level of pain on a 100-mm VAS.  The left-hand 
extreme of the line should be described as "no pain at all" and the right-hand extreme as 
"worst pain imaginable." 
Subject's Global Health Assessment: 
The subject's overall assessment of their disease activity in the past week on a 100-mm 
VAS. The left-hand extreme of the scale will be described as "no RA activity at all" (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme as "worst RA 
activity imaginable" (maximum arthritis disease activity). 
Investigator's Global Health Assessment: 
The Investigator's assessment of the subject's current disease activity on a 100-mm 
VAS. The left-hand extreme of the scale will be described as "no activity at all" (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme as "worst activity 
imaginable" (maximum arthri tis disease activity). 
Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index 
The HAQ-DI is a questionnaire on which subjects are asked to rate their level of difficulty 
on daily activities (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, and walking) and personal 
abilities (hygiene, reach, grip, and activity), as well as their use of aids, devices, or help 
from another person for these activities and disabilities.

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES to Protocol v. 3.0 
The protocol was amended per recommendation of FDA to state that all Injection Site 
Reactions, serious and non -serious, will be recorded as Adverse Events.  
Changed text is indicated by strikethrough (deleted text).  
Section. 6.4   Injection Site Assessment  
Positive events will furthermore be recorded as AEs . only if they are determined to be 
Serious Adverse Events.  
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES to Protocol v.2.0  
The protocol was amended to clarify discrepancies between the schedule of procedures 
(Tables 7.1 and 7.1.1) and the text, to correct minor errors and to add a Visual Analog Scale 
for evaluation of injection site pain.  
Changed text is indicated by  boldface  type (new text) or strikethrough  (deleted text). In 
addition to the changes shown below, clarifications, minor editorial and formatting changes 
have been made.  
Section 4.1 Participant inclusion criteria  
3.  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age. M ale subjects with female partners of 
child bearing potential must agree to use barrier contraception, e.g., condoms plus 
spermicide, from administration of the study drug until at least 3 months after 
administration of the study drug. Abstinence from heter osexual intercourse from 
administration of study drug until at least 3 months after administration of study drug is 
acceptable if it is in accordance with the subject’s lifestyle. Female subjects should be 
surgically sterile (had a bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with 
no menses prior to Screening and a serum follicle stimulating hormone in the 
postmenopausal range at Screening), or, if of child be aring potential, must be non -
lactating and willing to use a highly effective method of birth control for 30 days prior 
to administration of study drug and agree to continued use of this method until at least 1 
month after administration of study drug. Abst inence from heterosexual intercourse for 
30 days prior to administration of study drug until at least 1 month after the 
administration of study drug is acceptable if it is in accordance with subject’s lifestyle. 
May also consider including wording on male sterilization (vasectomy) and sole male 
partner of female subject sterilization (vasectomy).  
Reason for change: The deleted text was included in error in the original protocol . 
Section 6.2.2 Medical History  
The medical history will include: disorders of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; neoplastic 
and hematological disorders; infectious diseases; disorders of the cardiovascular system 
including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, each with duration; disorders o f the 
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  5                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
respiratory system; disorders of the kidney and urinary tract; disorders of the 
gastrointestinal system; disorders of the immune system, connective tissue and joints; 
endocrinology and metabolism with a subcategory for diabetes including year of 
diagnosis, treatment, complications including nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy; 
neurological disorders; and finally alcohol, illicit drug and smoking history including 
duration in years and 20-pack equivalents a day  number of pack years.  
Reason for cha nge: Correction  
 
Section 6.4 Injection Site Assessment  
A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used for evaluation of injection site pain. A 
copy of the VAS is in Appendix 2 . 
 
Reason for change: To provide a standardized measurement of tenderness.  
 
Positive events that are deemed clinically relevant will furthermore be recorded as AEs 
only if the y are determined to be Serious Adverse Events.   
 
Reason for change: Potential injection site reactions are of special interest and thus 
carefully assessed as described above. As asking participants to rate injection site pain 
is a form of solicitation, which results in biased reporting frequencies, non -serious 
injection si te reactions will not additionally be reported as AEs in the present study.   
  
Section 6.8.2.2 Urine PD  
Additional pooled urine collections will take place at the following intervals:  
• Day 1 0: a 4-hour urine collection will begin after dosing.  
• Day 1 0: from 4 hours post -dose until bedtime. Participants will be instructed to 
empty their bladders prior to sleep.  If the participant voids during the night, the 
urine will be collected and pooled with the first morning void. The time and 
volume of urine must b e recorded.  
• Day 2 1 through Day 3: 12 - hour urine collections.  
 
Reason for change: To be consistent with the Schedule of Procedures with regards to 
naming conventions for study days . 
 
Section 7.1.1: Sequestered Schedule - Footnote 4 and Section 7.2. 5.3

Synopsis  
 
Protocol Title:  
EXT608 in Human Healthy Adults; A First -in-Human, Randomized, Double -blind, 
Placebo -controlled, Single Dose Escalation Study  
 
Study Center(s):  
Pharmaceutical Research Associates, Inc.  
9755 Ridge Drive, Lenexa  KS, 66219  
 
Investigational Product:   
EXT608 dissolved in a buffered isotonic saline solution  
Starting Dose and Dose Escalation Scheme:  
The starting dose will be 4 µg in a volume of 10 ul.  Up to 6 dosing cohorts are planned 
with no single dose escalation to exceed a 3 -fold dose increment.  
 
Route of Administration:  
Subcutaneous (SC) injection  
 
Objectives and Endpoints:  
The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability profile of escalating 
dose levels of EXT608 when administered to healthy adult participants as a single 
injection as assessed by:  
1. Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals due to 
treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) [Time Frame: Day 0 up to Day 28]  
2. Frequency and severity of post -dose change from baseline in hematology, serum 
chemistries, urinalysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and physical 
examination (E xam) findings [Time Frame: Day 0 up to Day 28]  
3. Percentage of participants with injection site reactions [Time Frame: Day 0 to 
Day 7]  
The secondary objectives are to assess:  
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  7                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
1. Single dose PK including AUC 0-24h, AUC 0-48h, AUC 0-28d, AUC 0-≈, Cmax, Tmax, T½, 
ƛz, Cl/F and Vz/F.  
2. Single dose PD by post -dose change from baseline in serum chemistries with 
particular attention to Se -Ca, phosphate, magnesium, and creatinine. Urinalysis 
will also be performed.  
Furthermore, the exploratory objectives are to assess:  
1. Single  dose Immunogenicity by anti -drug antibodies (ADA) and any neutralizing 
subset (NAb),  
2. Single dose effect on vitamin D metabolism by serum 25 -hydroxy -vitamin D and 
1,25-dihydroxy -vitamin D concentrations.  
 
Number of Patients:  
Up to approximately 30 particip ants may be enrolled to the study intervention , such that 
approximately 24 evaluable participants complete the study.  
Additional participants and cohorts may be enrolled pending review of study data and 
recommendation by a Data Monitoring Board (DMB) and ratification by the Sponsor.  
Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, first -in-human (FIH), placebo -controlled single 
ascending dose (SAD) study to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of EXT608 in 
healthy adult participants. Each participan t will provide written informed consent and 
must meet all of the eligibility criteria prior to being randomized and administered study 
product. Participants who discontinue prematurely will be replaced at the discretion of 
the Sponsor . 
Participants will be enrolled into 1 of up to 6 planned single dose cohorts (designated as 
S1 through S6, respectively) in ascending fashion.  
Each cohort will consist of 4 participants randomized to receive either EXT608 or 
placebo, whereby 3 will receive  a single injection of EXT608 and 1 will receive matching 
placebo.  
A safe clinical starting dose will be targeted to have a <10% of maximal effect (E max) 
based on allometric scaling of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and 
will be less than  the threshold derived from 1/10 of the human equivalent of the No 
Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) established in GLP toxicology studies. Up to 6 dosing 
cohorts are planned with no single dose escalation to exceed a 3 -fold dose increment.  
Following a dose esc alation, participant dosing for the second and third participant will 
be staggered at least 72 hours post -dosing pending review of safety data including Se -Ca 
and adverse events (AEs) by the Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
A potential DLT is defined as any of the following EXT608 TEAEs that occurs during 
the DLT period, graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 ( 2):  
• Grade = 3 TEAE  
• Grade = 3 anemia  
• Grade = 3 AST/ALT elevation; and/or  
• Grade = 2 AST/ALT elevation and Grade = 2 Bilirubin elevation  
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  8                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
• Grade = 3 QTc prolongation  
• Grade = 3 Hyper - and/or Hypotension  
• Grade = 2 Hyperparathyroidism  
• Grade = 2 Hyperthyroidism  
• Grade = 3 Hypercalcemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypocalcemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypophosphatemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypomagnesemia  
• Grade = 3 Creatinine increased  
Dose escalation decisions will be based on the NCI Common Term inology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 ( 2) and Se -Ca levels.  
The DMB will review the seven -day safety data in each cohort before aut horizing the 
initiation of the next cohort according to the following decision tree:  
1. No Grade 3 AEs suspected related to study drug and no indication of effect 
observed from Se -Ca will result in the next dose at 3x the previous cohort dose.  
2. No Grade 3 AEs suspected related to study drug and clear indication of effect on 
Se-Ca will result in the next dose at 2x the previous cohort dose.  
3. A Grade 3 AE suspected related to study drug in a single (n=4) cohort and the 
absence of prohibitive effects on Se -Ca will  result in an additional cohort at the 
same dose.  
4. A single Grade 3 AE suspected related to study drug in 2 cohorts at the same dose 
(n=8) cohort and the absence of prohibitive indication of effects on Se -Ca will 
result in a dose escalation to 1.5x the prev ious dose.  
5. Two or more of the same Grade 3 AE within the same cohort suspected related to 
study drug, or average peak Se -Ca > 1.5 mg/dl above the Upper Limit of Normal 
(ULN) range will terminate dose escalation.  
a. If the last dose escalation was 50% and by implication 2 cohorts received 
the previous dose for an n=8, the study will stop.  
b. If the last dose escalation was >50%, the next cohort should receive a dose 
2/3x the previous dose.  
Any DMB recommendation that deviates from the decision tree will be ratif ied by the 
Sponsor prior to implementation.  
The study schematic is presented in Section 3.2. 
Pending the outcomes of the GLP toxicology and other nonclinical pharmacology studies, 
planned dose levels will be administered by subcutaneous injection.  
A screening visit will take place within 28 days of dosing.  
Participants for each cohort will be adm itted to the study unit 1 day prior to dosing and 
remain in the unit through at least 72 hours after dosing for safety and PK assessments 
before discharge. The total confinement period will be 4 nights, unless extended for 
management of AEs at the discreti on of the Investigator. The schedule of  events while 
inpatient  is provided in Section 7.1.1 . Follow -up visits to the clinic will occur on/about 
days 5 , 7, 14, 21 and 28. Participants will be monitored closely during the duration of the 
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  9                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
study for safety, PK, and PD assessments as described in Section 3.2. The total duration 
of follow -up period may be modified in the final study design based on safety and PK 
data from non -clinical studies, anticipated PK/PD response and extended in individual 
participants as needed to observe their calcium levels return to concentrations deemed not 
needing further follow up.  
Additional/Alternative PK/PD time points may be implemented if the Sponsor determines 
this is necessary to fully characterize the PK profi le of EXT608.

Statistical Methods  
Sample Size  
The sample size is not determined fo r inferential testing purposes. The sample size of 
4 participants per cohort (3 active: 1 placebo) is considered sufficient for evaluation of 
safety, tolerability, and PD of EXT608 prior to making a decision about dose escalation 
as Se -Ca is very tightly r egulated and determination of effect based on simulations can 
therefore reliably be made with the small sample.  
 
Statistical Analyses  
AEs will be presented in listings and TEAEs will be summarized. Individual results of 
laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be listed and change from 
baseline will be summarized using shift tables. Individual results of vital signs will be 
listed and observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized.  
Individual results of quantitative ECG parameters from the 12 -lead safety ECGs will be 
listed and observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized and analyzed 
consistent with the ICH E14 ( 3).  
All summaries will be performed by placebo and each EXT608 dose level. Placebo data 
will be pooled across cohorts. Ph ysical exam findings will be presented in data listings.  
Concentrations of EXT608 will be summarized by dose over each scheduled sampling 
time using descriptive statistics. Individual plasma concentration data versus time will be 
presented in a data listi ng. PK parameters will be summarized by dose using descriptive 
statistics. Dose proportionality will be assessed graphically and using a power model. PD 
will be presented in listings and summarized by dose and time point.  
Detection of ADA and NAbs will be  presented in listings and summarized by dose and 
time point.

1 Background Information  
1.1 Hypoparathyroidism  
Hypoparathyroidism is a rare clinical syndrome that results from reduced or absent 
parathyroid gland function and is characterized by low serum calcium (Se -Ca) levels, 
elevated serum phosphorus levels, and absent or inappropriately low levels of parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) in circulation. Hypoparathyroidism is most often caused by inadvertent 
removal or destruction ( i.e., radiation treatment) of the  parathyroid glands, the presence 
of autoimmune or congenital diseases, or low blood plasma magnesium levels. The low 
production of PTH in hypoparathyroidism patients leads to abnormally low calcium 
levels in blood, and an increase of phosphorus in the blo od. 
PTH is secreted in response to low blood Se -Ca levels. To release more ionic calcium 
into the blood, PTH indirectly stimulates bone matrix turnover, enhances renal tubular 
calcium reabsorption, as well as intestinal calcium absorption.  
Patients with hy poparathyroidism most often present with paresthesia, cramps, or tetany, 
but the disorder may also manifest acutely with seizures, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, 
or cardiac rhythm disturbances. In the postsurgical setting, the presentation can be acute 
with t etany, cramping, tachycardia, and altered mental status predominating. Affected 
individuals are most often diagnosed with low blood calcium, magnesium and PTH 
levels, but high phosphorus levels, and frequently show increased urinary calcium 
excretion, whic h can lead to nephrocalcinosis and kidney stones. Hyperphosphatemia can 
be associated with deposition of calcium -phosphate complexes in other soft tissues.  
1.1.1 Hypoparathyroidism standard of care  
Current standard of care for hypoparathyroidism includes oral c alcium carbonate 
supplements and active forms of vitamin D. Under restrictions, alternative treatment with 
once -daily injections of Parathyroid hormone (rhPTH (1 -84), Natpara®) has been 
approved by the FDA only for patients whose calcium levels can't be co ntrolled with 
calcium and vitamin D supplements.  
1.2 Extend Biosciences’ E XT608 
EXT608 is under development as an extended half -life hPTH(1 -34), covalently attached 
to a derivative of vitamin D using the D -VITylation® technology, which results in an 
extended half-life and improved absorption and bioavailability of PTH, aimed at  reducing 
the rate and/or doses of injections. For more information refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure ( 1). 
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), 
and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of EXT608 when administered as a single dose to 
healthy adult participant s. EXT608 has undergone a full non -clinical testing program as 
recommended by the FDA and is therefore ready to be studied in humans to further its 
development. Data from thi s study are intended to identify and select pharmacolog ically 
active dose levels for subsequent dose ranging and other studies  in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism.  
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  21                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
1.3 Rationale for Dose Selection  
A safe clinical starting dose will be targeted to have a <10% of maximal effect (E max) 
based on allometric scaling of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and 
will be less than the threshold derived from 1/10 of the human equivalent of the No 
Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) established in GLP toxicology stud ies. Up to 6 dosing 
cohorts are planned with no single dose escalation to exceed a 3 -fold dose increment.  
 
2 Trial Objectives and Purpose  
The purpose of this first -in-human study is to obtain initial safety, tolerability, PK, and 
PD information about E XT608 to facilitate optimal design of the first clinical study 
conducted in participants with the target indication.  
2.1 Primary O bjective  
The primary objective is to characte rize the safety and tolerability profile of escalating 
dose levels of EXT608 when administered to healthy adult participant s as a single 
injection as assessed by :  
1. Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals due to 
treatment eme rgent AEs (TEAEs) [Time Frame: Day 0 up to Day 28]  
2. Frequency and severity of post -dose change from baseline in hematology, serum 
chemistries, urinalysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and physical 
examination  (Exam)  findings [Time Frame: Day 0 up to Day 28]  
3. Percentage of participant s with injection or infusion site reactions [Time Frame: 
Day 0 to Day 7]  
2.2 Secondary O bjective s 
The secondary objectives are to  assess : 
1. Single dose PK  including AUC 0-24h, AUC 0-48h, AUC 0-28d, AUC 0-≈, Cmax, Tmax, T½, 
ƛz, C l/F and Vz/F . 
2. Single dose PD by post -dose change from baseline in serum chemistries with 
particular attention to Se-Ca, phosphate, magnesium , and creatinine . Urinalysis  
will also be performed . 
2.3 Exploratory Objectives  
Furthermore, the exploratory objectives are to assess : 
1. Single dose Immunogenicity by anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and any neutralizing 
subset (NAb),  
2. Single dose effect on vitamin D metabolism  by serum  25-hydroxy -vitamin D  and 
1,25-dihydrox y-vitamin D concentrations .

3 Trial Design  
3.1 Design Description  
This is a randomized, double -blind, first -in-human (FIH), placebo -controlled single 
ascending dose (SAD) study to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of EXT608 in 
healthy adult participant s. Each participant  will provide written informed  consent and 
must meet all of the eligibility criteria prior to being randomized and administered study 
product . Participant s who discontinue prematurely will  be replaced at the discretion of 
the Sponsor.  
3.1.1 Numbers of Cohorts and Participants, and Treatment Allocation  
Up to approximately 30 participants may be enrolled to the study intervention such that 
approximately 24 evaluable participants complete the study.  
Additional participants and cohorts may be enrolled pending review of study data and 
recommendat ion by a Data Monitoring Board (DMB) and ratification by the Sponsor.  
Participant s will be enrolled into 1 of up to 6 planned single dose cohorts (designated as 
S1 through S6, respectively) in ascending fashion.  
Each cohort will consist of 4 participant s randomized to receive either EXT608 or 
placebo, whereby 3 will receive a single injection of EXT608 and 1 will receive matching 
placebo.  
3.1.2 Starting Dose  
The starting dose will be 4 µg in a volume of 10 ul.  Up to 6 dosing cohorts are planned 
with no single dose escalation to exceed a 3 -fold dose increment.  
3.1.3 Staggering of Participants after Dose Escalation  (Sentinel Participants)  
For the first cohort, one participant will be dose d initially. A review of safety data, 
including Se -Ca and adverse events (AEs) for the first 72 hours post -dose will be 
conducted by the Investigator and Medical Monitor. If there are no safety concerns, a 
second participant will be dosed and the same safety review will be conducted to review 
data up to 72 -hrs post -dose. If there are no safety concerns, the last two participants in the 
cohort will be dosed.   
For subsequent cohorts, t his staggering requirement only applies to cohorts for doses 
higher than previous ly experience d in the study.   
3.1.4 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Criteria  
A potential DLT  is defined as any of the following EXT608 TEAEs that occurs during 
the DLT period, graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 ( 2):  
• Grade = 3 TEAE  
• Grade = 3 anemia  
• Grade = 3 AST/ALT elevation; and/or  
• Grade = 2 AST/ALT elevation and Grade = 2 Bilirubin elevation  
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  23                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
• Grade = 3 QTc prolongation  
• Grade = 3 Hyper - and/or Hypotension  
• Grade = 2 Hyperparathyroidism  
• Grade = 2 Hyperthyroidism  
• Grade = 3 Hypercalcemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypocalcemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypophosphatemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypomagnesemia  
• Grade = 3 Creatinine increased  
3.1.5 Dose Escalation  
Dose escalation decisions will be based on  the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 ( 2) and Se-Ca levels . 
The DMB will review the seven -day safety data in each cohort before authorizing the 
initiation of the next cohort according to the following decision tree:  
1. No Grade 3 AEs suspected related to study drug and no indication of effect 
observed from Se -Ca will result in the next dose at 3x the previous cohort  dose.  
2. No Grade 3 AEs suspected related to study drug and clear indication of effect on 
Se-Ca will result in the next dose at 2x the previous cohort dose.  
3. A Grade 3 AE suspected related to study drug in a single (n=4) cohort and the 
absence of prohibitive  effects on Se -Ca will result in an additional cohort at the 
same dose.  
4. A single Grade 3 AE suspected related to study drug in 2 cohorts at the same dose 
(n=8) cohort and the absence of prohibitive indication of effects on Se -Ca will 
result in a dose escal ation to 1.5x the previous dose.  
5. Two or more of the same Grade 3 AE within the same cohort suspected related to 
study drug, or average peak Se -Ca > 1.5 mg/dl above the Upper Limit of Normal 
(ULN) range will terminate dose escalation.  
a. If the last dose esca lation was 50% and by implication 2 cohorts received 
the previous  dose for an n=8, the study will stop.  
b. If the last dose escalation was >50%, the next cohort should receive a dose 
2/3x the previous dose.  
Any DMB recommendation that deviates from the decision tree will be ratified by the 
Sponsor prior to implementation.  
The study schematic is presented in Section 3.2. 
3.1.6 Individual Participant Schedule  
A screening visit will take place within 28 days of dosing. Eligible p articipant s for each 
cohort will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU)  1 day prior to dosing and 
remain in the CRU through at least 72 hours after dosing f or safety and PK assessments 
before discharge. The total confinement period will be 4 nights, unless extended for 
management of AEs at the discretion of the Investigator. The schedule of events while

inpatient  is provided in Section 7.1.1 . Follow -up visits to the CRU will occur on/about 
days 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Participant s will be monitored closely during the duration of the 
study for safety, PK, and PD assessments as described in  Section 3.2. The total duration 
of follow -up period may be modified in the final study design based on safety and PK 
data from non -clinical studies, anticipated PK/PD response and extended in individual 
participant s as needed to observe their calcium levels return to concentrations deemed not 
needing further follow up.  
Additional/Alternative PK/PD time points may be implemented if the Sponsor determines 
this is necessary to fully characterize the PK profile of EXT608.

3.3 Design rationale  
3.3.1 Population  
PK modeling of various approaches to extend the half-life of compounds in animals is 
generally not a good predictor of half -life in humans . Knowledge  of single do se PK and 
indications of PD in humans are usually sufficient to model multiple dose PK accurately 
and with reasonable precision , and can give  good indications of plasma drug 
concentrations . This enables the accurate determination of target dose range for 
therapeutic effect and therefore guides optimal design choice for studies in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism . 
The safest population  in which  to obtain the single dose PK is healthy participants.  
3.3.2 Control  
To study the PD , the most appropriate comparator is placebo, and as the participants do not 
have a parathyroid hormone deficiency , there are no concerns associated with that . 
3.3.3 Intervention  
EXT608 is the compound under development .  
3.3.4 Stratification, randomization and adaptive treatment allocation based 
on baseline covariates with strata  
In the modest planned cohort size, the DMB needs e valuable data  up to an d including 
Day 7 for a reliable dose escalation decision. Any participants for whom such data are not 
available will be replaced with a new participant receiving the same treatment assignment 
as the original participant  to ensure the  3:1 ratio of active compound to control.  
3.3.5 Blinding  
The primary outcome is safety and tolerability. The assessment relies partly on adverse 
events evaluation s that are prone to reporting bias and can be effectively mitigated with 
the double -blind design.  
3.3.6 Endpoint  
Dose limiting toxicity is routine ly determined by AEs related to the intervention under 
investigation. Acute effects of parathyroid hormone analogues can be monitored by 
changes Se-Ca, which is tightly regulated in normal physiology with a narrow normal 
range. Furthermore, the relation ship between elevated Se-Ca and adverse effects is well 
established.  The combination of the limiting toxicity guided by PD therefore appears 
optimal in this  situation.

Sponsor/CRO. The tables in Section 7.1 describe what data has to be collected when, and 
Section 7.2 outlines the activities in a logical but not mandatory sequence for ease of 
execution.  
6.1 Collection Methodology  and Data Flow  
6.1.1 Case Report Form  (CRF)  
An electronic  CRF  (eCRF)  will be supplied to the investigational site for collection of 
information.  The eCRF is not considered source information and the investigational site 
must have the information available in source documentation.  
6.1.2 Electronically uploaded data  
6.1.2.1  Participant F iles and Documents  
Participant files  are uploaded in the EDC under the specific participant ID. These files 
may include:

Minimally , the photographs  
1. prior to injection,  
2. when the event is at highest intensity, and  
3. when resolved or stabilized  
will be uploaded in the EDC.  
A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used for evaluation of injection site pain. A copy of 
the VAS is i n Appendix 2 . 
Positive events will furthermore  be recorded as AEs. 
6.5 Vital Signs: Pulse,  Blood Pressure , Respiratory Rate and 
Temperature  
Pulse, diastolic and systolic blood pressure are measured sitting after five minutes rest. 
Automated instruments may be used.  
Respiratory rate will be measured over at least 30 seconds if regular , if irregular , at least 
1 minute.  
Temperature will be measur ed orally.  
These data are recorded in the EDC.  
6.6 Weight,  Height  and Body Mass Index (BMI)  
Weight is measured with empty pockets and normal indoor clothes without shoes.  Weight 
is measured at several time points according to the  schedule and entered in the ED C. 
Height is measured without shoes an d is only measured at screening and entered in the 
EDC.  
The BMI is calculated by the EDC.  
6.7 Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Equipment for recording the ECG should be recently serviced and calibrated. Machine 
calibration records and performance data should be maintained on file.  
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be obtained in supine position after at least 5 minutes at 
rest. A copy of the recording will be made available for the Sponsor.  
At screening , any abnormalities or normal variants will be assessed for clinical relevance 
and recorded in the medical history. Subsequent changes will be recorded in the EDC 
description text field and deemed clinically relevant or not (separate file s). Changes that 
are deemed clinically relevant  are furthermore recorded as AEs .

6.10    Safety  Variables and Safety Reporting  
6.10.1  Adverse Events  
6.10.1.1  Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  or 
clinical investigation participant  administered a pharmaceutical product and which does 
not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding, for example), symptom, or di sease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not it is considered related to the medicinal product .  
Adverse events will be collected from the time informed consent is signed and until the 
Follow -Up or Early Termination visit .  
All participants will be queried, using non -leading questions, about the occurrence of AEs 
at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms should be 
identified as one overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for randomized subjec ts will be 
recorded in the eCRF and the subject's source documents. Adverse events for subjects who 
are screened but not subsequently randomized in the study will be recorded only in the 
subject's source documents. The following data should be documented f or each AE:  
• Description of the events  
• Classification of “serious” or “not serious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment giv en 
Adverse events  will be rated a mild, moderate or severe intensity using the following 
definitions:  
• Mild:  “Mild ” events are usually transient and do not interfere with the 
participant ’s daily activities.  
• Moderate:  “Moderate ” events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern 
to the participant  and may interfere with daily activities.  
• Severe:  “Severe ” events interrupt the participant ’s usual daily activit ies. 
 
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  38                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
The causality will be rated in the following categories : 
• Unlikely: An “unlikely” relationship suggests that only a remote connection exists 
between the investigational study product  and the reported AE. Other conditions, 
including chronic illness, progression or expression of the disease state or reaction 
to concomi tant medication, appear to explain the reported AE.  
• Possible: A “possible” relationship suggests that the associatio n of the AE with 
the investigational study product  is unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably 
supported by other conditions.  
• Probable: A “probable” relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal 
association  of the AE with study product  functionality  exists and, in the 
Investigator’s clinical judgment, it is likely that a causal relationship exists 
between the study product’s  functionality  and the AE, and other conditions 
(concurrent illness, progression or expression of disease state or concomitant 
medication reactions) do not appear to explain the AE.  
6.10.1.2  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE should be followed until the Investigator has determined and  provided the final 
outcome. The outcome should be classified according to the following categories:  
• Recovered/resolved: Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Resolution of an AE with residual signs or 
symptoms  
• Not recovered/not resolved (continuing): Either incomplete improvement or no 
improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing  
• Fatal: Outcome of AE is death. “Fatal” should be used when death is at least 
possibly related to the AE  
• Unknown: Outcome o f an AE is not known (e.g., subject lost to follow -up) 
6.10.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (the term “life -threatening” here refers to an event in which the 
participant  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Would in the opinion of the Investigator jeopardize the participant  
• May require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above

6.10.1.4  SAE Reporting Procedure  
Serious adverse events will be collected over the same time period as stated above for 
AEs. All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to the  drug. The initial 
report should include at least the following information:  
• Subject’s study ID number  
• Protocol number  
• Description of the event  
• Criterion for categorizing the AE as serious  
• Preliminary assignment of causality to study drug  
Any new informati on should be provided as it becomes available. Copies of discharge 
summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports, and any other relevant documents may 
also be requested.  
Appropriate remedial measure should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best 
medical judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the subject’s response to these 
measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
followed by the Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the investigator dee ms the 
SAE to be chronic or stable. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be 
employed by the Investigator as needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event.  
The Investigator will be responsible for reporting all SAEs to the Instit utional Review 
Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC). The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting to the 
regulatory authorities.  
Serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of coming to the 
Investigator's attention  Any serious adve rse event that occurs any time after the 
participant  has signed the informed consent form for the study, up to the participant ’s 
final study visit, inclusive, is to be reported to Product Safety within 24 hours following 
when the event was first recognized , discovered, or reported, regardless of severity or 
relationship to the study product . If unable to enter the SAE information in the EDC ( e.g., 
internet connection is down), the report may be reported by telephone to the Medical 
Monitor directly via cell phone at (609) 897 -0505 x7114 .  
Serious adverse events must be followed up by the Investigator until resolution or 
stabilization.

7.2 Chronological Description of Study Activities  
This section describes  the schedule of activities per assessment time point . Details of 
each procedure may be found in Section 6. 
The timing of a ll activities for a specific participant are counted in  minutes, hours or  days 
relative to the receipt of the study product  on minute, hour, Day 0. Unless otherwise 
noted, the maximal time tolerances on task execution is noted in the Schedules in 
Sections 7.1 and 7.1.1 .  Priority will be for the PK and PD assessments to be as close to 
the target time as possible. Deviation from this time window is not considered sufficient 
to disqualify the participant  from per protocol analysis.  
The sequence of activities with in each visit as described below is not fixed, but may be 
modified to optimize clinic workflow.

7.3 Data Monitoring Board and Dose Escalations  
7.3.1 Data Monitoring Board  
A DMB will be formed to monitor safety and dose cohort choices and provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor for implementation in the study. The DMB will 
minimally include an independent Safety Monitor, the Medical Monitor, the 
Investigator( s), and an independent statistician as voting members, as well as a non -
voting coordinator. Operational details will be described in a Safety Plan.  
7.3.2 Dose Escalations  
When the last participant of a cohort has completed Day 7 and evaluable data are 
available,  statistics will provide a data summary of the cohort data for the DMB. The 
DMB will meet and decide further actions as described in the Safety Plan.  
 
8 Statistical Methods  
8.1 Sample size  
The sample size is not determined for inferential testing purposes. The s ample size of 4 
participants per cohort (3 active: 1 placebo) is considered sufficient for evaluation of 
safety, tolerability, and PD of EXT608 prior to making a decision about dose escalation 
as Se -Ca is very tightly regulated and determination of effect based on simulations can 
therefore reliably be made with the small sample.  
8.2 Analysis populations  
Two participant populations will be defined. The Safety  of Full Analysis Set population 
(FAS) will be defined as all participants who are randomized. The Per-Protocol  (PP) 
population will be participants for whom evaluable data to and including Day 7 is 
available and with no major protocol violations.   
8.3 Data Analysis  
AEs will be presented in listings and Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will 
be summariz ed. Individual results of laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and 
urinalysis) will be listed and change from baseline will be summarized using shift tables. 
Individual results of vital signs will be listed and observed values and changes from 
baseline  will be summarized.  
Individual results of quantitative ECG parameters from the 12 -lead safety ECGs will be 
listed and observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized and analyzed 
consistent with the ICH E14 ( 3).  
All summaries will be performed by placebo and each EXT608 dose level. Placebo data 
will be pooled across cohorts. Physical exam findings will be presented in data listings.  
Concentrations of EXT608 will be summarized by dose over each scheduled sampling 
time using descriptive statistics. Individual plasma concentration data versus time will be 
presented in a data listing. PK parameters will be summarized by dose using descriptive

statistics. Dose proportionality will be assessed graphically and using a po wer model. PD 
will be presented in listings and summarized by dose and time point.  
Detection of ADA and NAbs will be presented in listings and summarized by dose and 
time point.  
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted as part of this study.  
DMB d ata packages will be based on the FAS for safety and PP for PK/PD.  
Further details are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
9 Direct Access to Source Data/Documents  
Extend Biosciences, Inc. or agents thereof, the reviewing IRB/EC, and health authorit ies 
from the US or other countries will have access to source documents at the 
investigational site for monitoring, auditing or inspection purposes.  
 
10   Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
10.1   Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by qualified site monitors approved by the Sponsor.  
Monitoring will be done via on -site visits by the site monitor, who will review the eCRFs 
and source documents, and via remote review of eCRF entries.  The site monitor will 
make sure that the investigation is conducted a ccording to protocol design, GCP, and 
regulatory requirements.  
Alternatively, due to the ongoing SARS -CoV -2 pandemic, all monitoring may be remote 
using a combination of source documents uploaded to the EDC and other tools for 
viewing site documents, e.g.,  for signed ICFs, for SDV. Further details will be described 
in a Clinical Monitoring Plan.  
10.2   Data Management  
Data will be entered in the electronic data capture (EDC) system at the investigational 
site.   
The data management plan will describe the methods  used to collect, check, validate, and 
process clinical data in detail.  It will also clarify the roles and responsibilities for the 
different functions and personnel involved in the data management process.   
AEs and medical/surgical history will be class ified according to the terminology of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version specified in the Data 
Management Plan).  Medications will be classified according to the latest World Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.  
Quality  control procedures will be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all 
data are reliable and have been processed correctly.  When all data have been coded, 
validated, and locked, clean file will be declared.  Any treatment -revealing data may  
thereafter be added and the final database will be locked.

10.2.1  Audits  
In addition to monitoring, the Sponsor, Sponsor’s representative, US or foreign 
regulatory authorities, and/or the reviewing IRB/ethics committee, may audit the conduct 
of the study.  The auditors must have access to all study documents, the facilities where 
the study was conducted, and the study staff for interviews.  The investigator will contact 
the Sponsor immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection at the 
center.  
 
11   Ethics  
The study will be performed in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), and the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaratio n of Helsinki.  
An IRB will approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the informed 
consent form and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the 
subjects, before any subjects are enrolled.  The investigator wil l ensure the distribution of 
these documents to the applicable IRB/EC and to the staff of the study site.  
11.1   Informed Consent  
Prior to performing any study procedures, written informed consent will be obtained from 
the subject.  The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the 
contents of the informed consent will comply with ICH -GCP and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
 
12   Data Handling and Recordkeeping  
The investigator must keep the study documentation for 15 years after the comp letion of 
the study.  
 
13   Publication Policy  
The Sponsor intends to publish the findings of the study and in general follows the 
guidelines set forth by the Internal Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) (6). 
The investigator may publish the data from the site one year after the last participant 
finished the study.

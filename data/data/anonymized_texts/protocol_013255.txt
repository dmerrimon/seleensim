 2 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
 
TXA127 is  a pharmaceutically -formulated angiotensin (1 -7) [A(1 -7)] heptapeptide, an 
endogenously produced, non -hypertensive derivative of angiotensin II ( Ang II). TXA127 is 
currently in development to reduce progression of respiratory disease in COVID -19 patients. 
TXA127 has been shown to reduce inflammation and fibrosis and restore endothelial and 
epithelial barrier function in acute lung injury. The mecha nism behind the beneficial effect of 
A(1-7) appears to be mediated via the Mas receptor.  
 
TXA127 or A(1 -7) has been evaluated in several pre-clinical efficacy models of lung injury, 
including a bleomycin -induced acute lung injury model, a ventilator -induce d acute lung injury 
model, an oleic acid -induced acute lung injury model and an ovalbumin model of asthma.  
A favorable safety profile was demonstrated with TXA127 in preclinical toxicology studies. 
Administration of TXA127 to rats and dogs by intravenous ( IV) injection for 1 month at doses up 
to 1 mg/kg/day resulted in no adverse effects. Similarly, no adverse effects were found when 
TXA127 was administered by SC injection to rats and dogs at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day for 1 
month. In a 100 -day toxicity study , the no observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) for systemic 
toxicity was 50 mg/kg/day in both the rat and dog. No hemodynamic changes were observed 
when TXA127 was administered to conscious rats by SC injection or IV infusion at doses up to 
1 mg/kg. No ca rdiovascular changes were noted in dogs treated for 4 weeks at doses up to 1 
mg/kg/day IV or 10 mg/kg/day SC. Functional assessment of the central nervous system (CNS) 
in the 100 -day toxicity study in the rat showed no effects on functional observational b attery 
(FOB) or locomotor activity after 95 days of treatment with up to 50 mg/kg/day. In the 100 -day 
toxicity study in the dog at Day 94, electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment showed lower heart 
rate at all doses up to 50 mg/kg/day, a change that was treatme nt- but not dose -related,  
longer PR and RR intervals, and no changes in QRS, QT, or QT interval corrected according to 
the Van de Water formula (QTcV). Respiratory assessments in the same study showed no 
treatment -related changes in respiratory frequency,  tidal volume, or minute volume doses up to 
50 mg/kg/day. TXA127 was not mutagenic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro tests.  
Ten clinical studies that have completed, terminated early, or are ongoing, have evaluated the 
safety and effectiveness of TXA127 . Seven clinical studies that were either completed or 
terminated early have analyzed and reported final data on the safety and effectiveness of 
TXA127. A total of 108 subjects received TXA127 and 38 subjects received placebo or other 
drug in these studies . Two additional studies are ongoing; final data are being collected for one 
study that completed enrollment (n = 75, TXA127 or placebo, data are blinded) and for one

 3 study that terminated early (n = 15, all TXA127 -treated). One additional study, planned f or 
pediatric patients and submitted under U.S. Investigational New Drug Application (IND) 58,561, 
was Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved but was terminated before enrolling patients.  
All studies were conducted under U.S. IND 58,561 (oncology) with the exception of two studies 
that were conducted under different INDs: Study A17 -002 (IND 60,159; renal) and Study 
TXA127 -2008 -001 (IND 101,736; infectious disease). The dose of TXA127 ranged from 0.0025 
to 1.0 mg/kg/day across a range of treatment regimen s in the 9 studies that enrolled subjects. In 
the 7 completed and early terminated studies, TXA127 was found to be well -tolerated with no 
dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) identified in any study. Of the 39 serious adverse events (SAEs) 
reported in these 7 s tudies, none were classified as definitely related or probably related to the 
study drug. Only one SAE, a case of anemia in Study A17 -002 of patients with end -stage renal 
disease, was classified as possibly related to the study drug (TXA127). Of the SAEs r eported for 
16 subjects in the 2 ongoing studies, one SAE of allergic reaction/hypersensitivity in Study 
TXA127 -2010 -001 was classified as possibly related to the study drug (TXA127).  
2.2 Rationale  
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is the cause  of coronavirus 
disease  2019 (COVID -19) that can be associated with severe respiratory and multi -organ 
failure.  SARS -CoV-2 is thought to enter  cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE -2) 
on the surface of cells resulting in endocytosi s and then translocation. During this process ACE -
2 is also internalized and phagocytosed and thereby may become non -functional. ACE -2 
mediates the conversion of angiotensin  II to angiotensin -(1-7), that opposes the effect of 
angiotensin  II. It is likely t hat COVID -19 reduces levels of ACE -2 and therefore angiotensin -(1-
7). As a result, angiotensin II levels are going to be increased. This hypothesis explains many 
clinical observations in COVID -19 specifically the high incidence of acute kidney injury that may 
be due to profound intra -renal vasoconstriction caused by excessive levels of angiotensin II.   
The synthesized version of angiotensin -(1-7) is TXA127. Administration of  TXA127  has been 
studied  in multiple phase I and II studies such as    
• A phase I safe ty and biological activity study in patients with HIV  
• A phase II trial for the treatment of skeletal muscle fibrosis and reduced muscle strength 
in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to reduce or to prevent the 
disease progression  
• A phase I st udy in healthy volunteers  
• A Phase IIb Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of TXA127 in the Reduction of 
Incidence and Severity of Thrombocytopenia in Patients Receiving Combination 
Gemcitabine and Platinum Therapy for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Perit oneal 
Carcinoma  
• A Phase I/II  Single -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Trial  of TXA127 alone and in 
combination with erythropoietin on optimization of hemoglobin in end -stage renal 
disease patients

 4   
Except for the last study , TXA127 has been administered subcutaneously  with a dose range 
of 0.01 to 0.5  mg/kg per day with most studies  using a dose of approximately 0.3 mg/kg/day.    
One study (“Effect of TXA127 alone and in combination with erythropoietin on optimization of 
hemogl obin in end -stage renal disease patients”) used a dose range of  0.01-0.05 mg/kg  per day 
intravenously three  times per week for 12 weeks.   
  
160 patients received  TXA127  in dose ranges from  0.0025 to1.0 mg/kg/day.  Only 1 of these 
patients were found to have  a single  serious adverse event (anemia) that was considered 
possibly related to the administration of  TXA127.   
 
2.3 Objective  
  
Primary endpoint   
• All-cause m ortality  (from start of experimental drug  to day 28)  with Acute Kidney Injury as a 
composite endpoint (two times  serum creatinine above normal; this way we avoid potential  
noise with regard to small changes of serum creatinine ). 
 
Secondary endpoints   
• Incidence of respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilatory support   
o The proportion of patients a live and free of respiratory failure from start of 
experimental drug /randomization  to day 28. With prolonged ventilation 
considered to be clinically equivalent to respiratory failure.  
 
• Renal failure requiring dialysis (either continuous or intermittent)   
o This will be measured by modality, duration and indications of dialysis from  start 
of experimental drug /randomization  to day 28.  
• Vasoplegic  shock requiring vasopressors   
o Measured by proportion of participants experiencing this event from start of 
experime ntal drug /randomization  to day 28.  
• Inflammatory markers, specifically IL -6 levels   
• Return to baseline oxygen requirement from start of experimental drug /randomization  to 
day 28  
• ICU Length of stay  
• Hospital length of stay  
• Time of recovery to return to baseline oxygen requirement

 5 • Clinical status  
o Measured with questionnaires of ordinal scale , NEWS scale and SOFA score. 
The subcomponents of these scales will be collected daily through Day 10 of 
patient hospitalization or until discharge, whichever comes f irst.  
• Proportion of patient improvement measured by return to room air and return to normal 
renal function  
• Time of improvement measured by return to room air scaled at days 5, 10, 28 and 60.  
• All-cause mortality at day 60

 6 3 STUDY DESIGN  
Description of S tudy Design  
This is a Prospective, double -blinded, randomized placebo -controlled tria l with two groups: the 
study drug (treatment group) and the placebo group (control group). We will study  severe  
COVID -19 patients admitted to the hospital with respiratory  insufficiency and oxygen 
requirements .  
 
 
Approximate time to obtain data:  
 
 Data abstraction from EMR for clinical v itals, clinical blood work,  clinical chest x -ray/CT 
chest imaging, COVID -19 history and symptoms : 25-30 minutes  
 Research Blood draw: 5 minutes  
 Nurse a dministration of study drug : 5 minute s  
 Completion of patient assessments: 10 minutes  
 
Expected duration of subject participation  
The participant is expected to complete study procedures during  ten days  of hospitalization – or 
until patient  is discharged, whichever comes first. Afterwards  a study member will call the 
participant for follow -up AEs at 24 -72hrs  post discharge , at day 28(+/ - 2 days) and at day 60 (+/ - 
2 days).

 7 4 STUDY POPULATION  
4.1 Selection of the Study Population  
Sample size  
Target sample size is n= 50.  
 
Recruitment pool:  
Subjects  will be drawn from inpatient hospitalized patients at New York Presbyterian 
Hospital /Columbia University Irving Medical Center (including the Allen Hospital) via person -to-
person  communication between physicians and review of electronic medical records for COVID -
19 admissions.   
 
 
Screened vs Enrolled : 
 Screened  
A participant is considered to be screened when their medical records have been 
reviewed by the investigators and eligibility criteria has been met. The CRC will keep  
record of the total number of eligible and ineligible screened participants.  
 
 Enrolled  
The participant is considered enrolled when the investigator has determined their 
eligibility based on the review of their EMR clinical chart  and has signed the informed 
consent form . 
 
4.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria   
• Severe COVID -19: Adul t patients admitted to the hospital through the ED requiring 
oxygen therapy  (any level)  to maintain SaO2 > 90%   
• COVID positive by PCR  on hospital admission  
• Hospitalized patients aged 18 or greater  
• have a negative pregnancy test

 8 • Pre-existing chronic kidney disease   
• New use of  or change in dose of  ACE-inhibitors or  ARB within the last 6 months    
• Acute kidney injury at the time of enrollment defined  as either increase pf serum 
creatinine by more than 50% or 0.3 mg/dL above baseline or estimated creatinine 
clearance (by MDRD) of less than 60 ml/min (if no baseline serum creatinine available)   
• Pregnant and breastfeeding women  
• Contraindicated medications: new use or change of medications from start of trial  
o Start of an ACE inhibitor or ARB within 6 months of trial.  
 
 
Please Note:  
• Guidelines from the FDA and NIH for the definition of severe COPD were followed 
including: Positive testing by standard RT -PCR a ssay or an equivalent test; Symptoms 
suggestive of severe systemic illness with COVID -19, which could include any symptom 
of moderate illness or shortness of breath at rest, or respiratory distress; and Clinical 
signs indicative of severe systemic illness with COVID -19, such as respiratory rate ≥ 30 
per minute, heart rate ≥ 125 per minute, SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air at sea level or 
PaO2/FiO2 < 300  
• Participants may receive investigational therapies that are used in the context of local 
standard of care for COVID -19, participation in other clinical studies may complicate the 
assessment and impact interpretation of efficacy and safety data in this study. Inclusion 
of other antiviral treatments consistent with standard of care is acceptable.  
• On May 1, 2020, FDA auth orized use of the unapproved product remdesivir for 
treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID -19 in adults and children 
hospitalized with severe disease. Severe disease, for the purposes of the Emergency 
Use Authorization (EUA), was defined as p atients with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 
94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen or requiring mechanical ventilation or 
requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Therefore, incorporating 
remdesivir into clinical trials, as a componen t of standard of care for patients hospitalized 
with severe disease, in settings where remdesivir is available via the EUA mechanism is 
acceptable.

 9 5 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVA LUATIONS  
5.1 Study Procedures  
 
Methods for collecting Clinical data: 
 Medical History /Medications /Vitals/clinical blood -work/chest x -ray/CT 
imaging/COVID -19 symptoms and history/AE or SAE  
The clinical data will be abstracted daily from the NYP/Columbia’s EMR system called 
“EPIC.” Only individuals that have access to this system will abstrac t data; this includes 
the investigators and CRC.   
 
Methods for collecting Research  data:  
 Research Blood -work Collection:  
Research blood -work will be collected on Days 1,5  and 10 only and if patient remains 
hospitalized. A study team member will ask phlebotomist  to please assist in drawing 
blood for research purposes  and will provide  the proper  tubes. If phlebotomist is 
unavailable, a study team member with certification in  phlebotomy or MD degree will 
gown up wearing appropriate PPE and collect the labs needed.  
 
 
Procedures for study visits:  
 Registering participant:  
The participant needs to be registered in IBM CTMS system – a secure clinical trial 
website/tool used to validate research study participants so it may interface with EPIC.   
 
 Method of Randomization:  
SAS block random ization  was used  and disclosed to the research pharmacy for study 
drug randomization and dispensation.   
 
 Unblinded personnel:  
The Research Pharmacy will remain unblinded for safety purposes. If needed for safety 
concerns – the DSMB chair will be unblinded. In addition,  the CRC is unblinded due to 
the creation of the SA S block randomization.  
 
 Ordering study drug / Scheduling study tests:  
Using the new electronic medical record system of EPIC, the PI and co -investigators will 
need to order and sign off on all study drug ordering .

Calculated dose (mg/kg) x Dru g Factor (1.19mg) = Actual dose (mg).  
 
• Calculated Dose  - The calculated dosage of the study drug per participant’s 
weight. For example: A participant weight is 75 kg and the dosage of the drug is 
0.5mg/kg. Therefore, 75kg x 0.5 mg/kg = 37.5 mg. This is the  calculated dose.  
 
• Drug Factor  - The drug substance of TXA127 acetate also contains moisture.  In 
order to follow protocol of 0.5mg/kg, we have to weigh out more of the drug 
substance than corresponds to 0.5 mg/kg so we can end up dosing the patient 
with 0. 5 mg/kg TXA127.   In other words, 1 mg of TXA127 would weight out 1.19 
mg of drug substance.   The Lead pharmacist and drug sponsor have agreed to 
add the drug factor to the calculated dosage as follows:  0.5 mg/kg x 1.19 = 0.595 
mg/kg.  
For example: If the ca lculated dose of a participant is 37.5mg, then we would multiply  it 
by the drug factor as such: 37.5mp x 1.19 mg = 44.625 mg (round to 45 mg).  Therefore, 
the actual  dose  would be 45 mg .  
Angiotensin (1 -7) / TXA127: 0.5 mg/kg per day for ten days intravenou sly over 3 hours 
or Placebo.   
 
• The PI /Sub-Is/CRC  will order  the study drug order in EPIC. Within the order there 
will be an “ order instruction ” instructing the PI /Sub-I/CRC  to include the “drug 
factor” of 1.19 to the calculation of the actual dose.  Calcul ated dose x 1.19 = 
Actual dose.   The patient’s weight would be documented in the “ administration 
instruction ”. 
• To place the study drug order in EPIC, it must be as an “in -patient” order and 
linked to the research study.

Rationale for the necessity of such risks  
Improvement in perfusion specifically renal perfusion, replacement of endogenous angiotensin 
1-7. 
 
Alternative data gathering procedures that have been conside red or will be considered  
No alternatives as there are presently no treatment or prevention modalities of COVID -19 
associated AKI . 
 
Why alternative procedures may not be feasible  
There are presently no treatment or prevention modalities of COVID -19 associa ted AKI . 
 
Why the value of the information to be gained outweighs the risks involved.  
COVID -19 associated AKI has a very high mortality  and preventing this AKI by administering 
angiotensin 1 -7 at a dose that can be considered a replacement of physiologic l evels and has 
no substantial adverse effects may improve mortality .

 Screening will be done by the PI/Sub -Is on a weekday daily basis. Emails will be sent to 
the study group with list of new COVID -19 admissions and brief description of the 
potential participant’s  medical history. Based on this the physicians would narrow which 
patients would be a good candidate for the study. Then a further in -depth review of their 
medical chart is done to ascertain  the eligibility criteria.  
 The physicians or CRC will appropriate ly gown up in PPE and approach the patient for 
informed consent.  
6.2 Day 1 through Day10  
 
 Day 1 through 10 procedures is listed in the Schedule of Assessments. These 
procedures will be done for 10 consecutive in -patient hospitalization day from date of 
consent  or until patient is discharged (in the case patient is discharge prior to Day 10).  
6.3 Follow -up phone calls  
 Assess for AE : Ask questions related to any possible adverse reaction to the drug  and

 17 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENT AN D REPORTING  
All AE and SAE will be captured and assessed at the end of each study visit and via AE phone 
calls done at 24 -72hr post discharge  and at Day 28 (+/ - 2 days ) and at Day 60 (+/ - 2 days ) post 
enrollment.   
8.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE)  
 
Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject. This may include 
symptom(s), illness, clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or change in value, or 
worsening in a subject during a clinical study.  
 
Procedures for Adve rse Events  
During Day 1 through Day 10 : 
AEs will be extracted from Standard Medical Treatment and clinical notes within EPIC. These 
will be reported in AE log within the regulatory binder. The PI/co -I will complete the Adverse 
Event Form within seven days of learning of the event (if life -threatening or death) and within 15 
days for all other SUSARs. The CRC will comply with local regulations and policies when 
notifying the institutional IRB.   
 
During follow -up phone  calls : 
The CRC will record the AE within the CRF, as well as complete the AE log in the regulatory 
binder. Information recorded includes: name of event, date of onset, date of awareness, 
severity, duration, and relationship to study drug (if it can be determined) . Severe adverse 
events will be followed until they are adequately resolved or stabilized during the study. The 
CRC will then notify the PI (or co -investigators if the PI is unavailable) and complete the Severe 
Adverse Event Form within seven days of learn ing of the event.  
The following general definitions for rating severity should be used for this study:  
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and transient; causing no loss of 
time from normal activities; symptoms would not require medi cation or a medical treatment; 
signs and symptoms are transient.  
Moderate: Marked symptoms and discomfort severe enough to cause moderate interference 
with the subject’s usual activities. Symptomatic treatment is possible.  
AAAT0535 – TXA Trial Version 2.0 
 25 August  2021 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
 
 18 Severe: Incapacitating with inabi lity to do work or usual activities; signs and symptoms may be 
of systemic nature or require medical intervention and/or treatment. Hospitalization may be 
required or prolonged.  
 
The relationship of an AE or SAE to the underlying disease or to the procedure will be attributed 
using the following definitions:  
Unrelated: There is no evidence that the event has a relationship to the drug(s).  
Unlikely: There is no evidence that the event has a relationship to the drug(s). However, the 
potential associat ion to the drug cannot be totally eliminated.  
Possibly Related : The event has a timely relationship to the drug(s) used. However, a potential 
alternative etiology may be responsible for the adverse event.  
Probably Related : The event has a timely relations hip to the drug(s) used and the causative 
relationship can clearly be established. No potential alternative etiology is apparent.  
Related: There is evidence that the event has a relationship to the drug(s).  
 
There is no standard scale for COVID patients, t hus we will use the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0  
• Grade 1  
Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
• Grade 2  
Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate 
instrumental ADL*.  
• Grade 3  
Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabl ing; limiting self care ADL**.  
• Grade 4   
Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5  
Death related to AE.  
Serious Adverse Events  
 
In accordance with 21 CFR Parts 803 and 812, an SAE is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence  that results in:  
o death,  
AAAT0535 – TXA Trial Version 2.0 
 25 August  2021 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
 
 19 o is life -threatening; any adverse experience that places the subject, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does not 
include a reaction that, had it occurred in a mor e serious form, might have caused 
death) ,  
o requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
o results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
o is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
o requires intervention to prevent  permanent impairment or damage  
o Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they might jeopardize the subject and might require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
All SAE will be reported to the PI and co -investigators within 24 hours after knowledge of the 
occurrence. If a serious adverse event (SAE) occurs during an in -person study visit or by phone, 
the CRC will follow the same steps as with the AE reporting.  
The IND sponsor has the obligation to report all serious adverse events that are ‘Probably’ or 
‘Related’ and ‘Unexpected’ in relation to the study drug to the FDA. SAEs are reported to the 
IRB only if they meet the definition of a UP and these will be submitted by the PI. All events 
reported to the FDA by the IND sponsor are to be submitted utilizing the Form FDA 3500A 
(MedWatch Form), i f applicable.  
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
“Unanticipated problem”: any incident, experience or outcome involving risk to subjects or 
others in any human subjects’ research that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity o r frequency) given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the IRB approved protocol and informed consent document, and (b) 
the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 Related or possibly related to participation in such research  (i.e., there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in such research); and  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.

 20 8.2 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject (or a 
Cohort), if applicable  
Withdrawal:   
The only reason for a patient being considered withdrawn should be withdrawal of cons ent. If 
this occurs. data collected up to the date of withdrawal may be used in data analysis. No further 
data collection will be done,  and no follow -up calls will be made.  
Withdrawal will in no way affect the care management of the participant.  
Disconti nuation:  
Treatment d iscontinuation from the study might occur if the participant experiences a serious 
adverse event per definition and the investigator decides to discontinue drug administration for 
the safety of the subject . However, patients who discontinue treatment will remain in the study 
and continue to be assessed for efficacy and safety.   
For example, for acute kidney injury: The study drug will be continued after development of 
acute kidney injury and we will continue to monitor the patient . However, if a patient starts 
dialysis, we will discontinue study drug but will still follow the patient clinically per protocol.  
Patients who become pregnant during the study will immediately discontinue the study drug but 
will continued to be followed p er schedule of assessments . The outcome  of pregnancy 
(spontaneous abortion, therapeutic abortion, live birth, fetal death in utero)  will be recorded . 
Loss to Follow -up: 
To minimize loss to follow -up, we will continue to follow patients after discharge via phone calls 
post discharge date, at day 28 and day 60 and ascertain vital status in all patients.   
8.3 Halting Rules  
 
The decision to halt the study will be left at the discretion of the DSMB, after the DSMB has had 
the opportunity  at each DSMB meeting to review cumulative unblinded comparative safety 
results as well as cumulative unblinded comparative efficacy results.

 9 CLINICAL MONITORING  STRUCTURE  
Study team (PI, co -investigators and CRC) research meetings will be held quarterly (less 
or more frequent depending on participant enrollment) to review the study status, any 
AEs or SAEs, primary and secondary outcome measures, among other topics. Any 
clinical safety modifications will be discussed and made during these meetings.  
The Anesthesiology department implemented a Compliance Research Coordinator 
whose responsibilities include quarterly reviews of the regulatory binder, consent and 
HIPAA forms and subject case histories . After the compliance coordinator reviews the 
study materials, a copy of the monitoring report is filed in the Regulatory Binder. Any 
revisions listed in the reporting are promptly addressed by the clinical research 
coordinator.  
9.1 Data Safety and Monitoring Board – DSMB  
 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) composed of 4 individuals : 2 
pulmonary specialists , one regulatory/statistical clinical trial specialist  and one kidney 
specialist  will be established to provide independent benefit/risk oversight during the 
conduct of the study. The DSMB will: 1) Review the protocol and consent form prior to 
study initiation, 2) Evaluate Serious Adverse Eve nts on an “as needed” basis and all 
adverse events on a quarterly basis, 3) Recommend discontinuation of the study in the 
event of the occurrence of Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events that are determined by 
the DSMB to pose a significant safety concern. The Chairperson of the DSMB will notify 
the HRPO and Dr. D’Armiento  who will in turn notify the FDA or other regulatory bodies of 
adverse safety outcome information sufficient to stop the study. This information will also 
be reported as part of required regulatory progress update reports.

 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
10.1 Study  Outcome Measures  
Severe  COVID -19  
Primary endpoint s  
• All-cause m ortality  (from start of experimental drug  to day 28)  including subcomponent 
of Acute Kidney Injury  
Secondary endpoints   
• Incidence of respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilatory s upport   
• Renal failure requiring dialysis (either continuous or intermittent)   
• Vasoplegic  shock requiring vasopressors   
• Inflammatory markers, specifically IL -6 levels   
• Reduction in supplemental oxygen requirements from start of experimental drug  
• ICU Length of stay  
• Hospital length of stay  
• Time of recovery to return to baseline oxygen requirement  
• Clinical status (mechanical ventilation, requiring dialysis and death)  
• Proportion of patient improvement measured by return to room air and return to normal 
renal fun ction  
• Time of improvement scaled at days 5, 10, 28 and 60.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
If we assume a proportion of 65% mortality in patients with severe COVID -19 and further 
assume that administration of angiotensin (1 -7) / TXA127 will reduce the proporti on of 
mortality to 15% we will require a total sample size of 50 subjects (25 in each group) to 
reach a power of 92% with a 95% confidence level.  
10.3 Analysis Plan  
 
AAAT0535 – TXA Trial Version 2.0  
 25 August 2021  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
 
23 
 The definition of the primary efficacy endpoints:  
Primary endpoint of this study will be all-cause m ortality  (from start of experimental drug 
to day 28) including subcomponent of Acute Kidney Injury.  
Any cause mortality including  palliative withdrawal or withholding of support from start of 
experimental drug to day 28.  For intercurrent events  besides death, the main estimand 
for each key efficacy endpoint will follow the treatment policy strategy. Therefore, the 
analyses will include all observed on -study data regardless of  patients’ use rescue 
medications, discontinuation of the investigation al product, or other violations of the 
protocol.  
 
 
Secondary endpoints are defined as follows:  
 
Respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilatory support   
Any endotracheal intubation for respiratory failure within 28 days after initiation of study 
drug/placebo; we will exclude intubations that are required for providing anesthesia for 
any surgeries or procedures. Patients who require intubation for the provi sion of 
anesthesia will remain in the study as prolonged ventilation is considered to be clinically 
equivalent to respiratory failure.  
 
Renal failure requiring dialysis (either continuous or intermittent)  
Any use of dialysis (continuous or intermittent he modialysis or peritoneal dialysis) within 
28 days after initiation of study drug/placebo  
 
Vasoplegic  shock requiring vasopressors  
Proportion of patient requiring any vasopressor drug such as phenylephrine, 
norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine or dopami ne for more than two hour within 28 
days after initiation of study drug/placebo. The time of possible procedures or operations 
are not included in this definition  
 
Inflammatory markers, specifically IL -6 levels  
Absolute levels of the following inflammatory  markers (continuous variables):  
IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate. We will determine the 
peak value within 28 days after start of experimental drug/placebo as a secondary 
endpoint  
 
Return to baseline oxygen requirement f rom start of experimental drug/placebo to day 
28  
Time to ability to maintain oxygen saturation (SaO2) >95% or above baseline in patients 
with baseline low sAo2 (for example due to COPD) with supplemental oxygen 
administration

24 
 The multiplicity control pr ocedure to be used to control the family -wise type I 
error:  
 
We acknowledge that family -wise type errors are a concern considering that many of our 
primary and secondary endpoints are interdependent. For example, vasopressor use (a 
secondary endpoint) is frequently associated with AKI (our primary endpoint). We will 
attempt control for the multiplicity by  
1. Using all-cause mortality with a subcomponent of acute kidney injury to aligned with the 
type of study of a proof of concept study  
2. Use of a combined secondary endpoint; this endpoint is achieved if the patient either 
dies, requires intubation or renal replacement therapy within 28 of initial administration of 
study drug / placebo  
 
 
Main analysis for each of the key primary and secondary efficacy endpoi nts: 
 
Primary endpoint  of all -cause mortality will be used as a binary variable and compared 
between patients receiving study drug and placebo using Chi -Square test. We will 
analyze all randomized patients in the main efficacy analysis for primary and seco ndary 
endpoints, regardless of whether they have missing data.  
 
Respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilatory support, Renal failure requiring 
dialysis and vasoplegic  shock requiring vasopressors will also be determined as binary 
variables. Pea k Inflammatory markers within 28 days, specifically IL -6 level will be 
analyzed as a continuous variable.  
Intercurrent events are a concern and some of these patients may for example receive 
rescue medications or treatments . For intercurrent events besides  death, the main 
estimand for each key efficacy endpoint will follow the treatment policy strategy. 
Therefore, the analyses will include all observed on -study data regardless of  patients’ 
use rescue medications, discontinuation of the investigational produ ct, or other violations 
of the protocol.  
 
We will use the appropriate statistical methods to analyze the primary and secondary 
endpoints such as Ch -Square for binary variables, t -test or Mann -Whitney test for 
continuous variables .  Significance will be determined at two -sided p <0.05. Variables 
that are significant in a univariate analysis will be included in a multi -variate analysis in 
addition to demographic variables such as sex, age or race, presence of co -morbidities 
and seve rity of COVID -19 as described below.  
More detailed statistical methods will be determined with the consultation of a statistician 
prior to unblinding and data analysis .

 medical records in EMR system to determine further eligibility based on the 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria . 
 
 Signed Informed Consent Form  
The clinical research coordinator or PI or co -investigator will  thoroughly go over the 
consent form and provides the participant ample time for them to read it and ask any 
questions or concerns they m ay have. After participant reviews the consent form, written 
consent is obtained by the participant. At that moment, the participant is considered to 
be enrolled in the study and an ID# is given. A copy of the consent and HIPAA forms are 
provided to the pa rticipant.  
12.4 Subject Confidentiality  
All subject identifiers will be removed after collection of the data and the data will receive 
a code that will allow us to link this data to the medical record number and will be stored 
in a locked and secured, encrypte d computer. Access to any of the data will be restricted 
to the principal investigator, coinvestigators and CRC by assignment of a password.  
12.5 Data Capture Methods  
Study data is captured  by paper and electronic forms. Any self -reported data by the 
patients will be captured and incorporated into CRF including timing of drug 
administration. Electronic data such as Medical Record abstraction will be extracted from 
EPIC. Excel tracking sheets  are maintained by the CRC as internal electronic 
documents  which will eventually be transferred to RedCap . Trained study staff will enter 
data from the paper CRFs into the  excel file . This method, once implemented will serve 
as the source documents and ma y be printed for audit/review purposes if need be.  
12.6 Study Records Retention  
All source documents including but not limited to data collection, study materials, reports 
and internal documents will be retained within the CU IMC/NYP premise in a locked file 
cabinet, inside a locked office for the longest duration dictated by applicable regulations 
(6 years for HIPAA, 3 years for HHS, 2 years for FDA, contract with drug sponsor may 
require longer duration).

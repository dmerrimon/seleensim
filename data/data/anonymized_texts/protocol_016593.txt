2.1 Name, Description and Intended Use of the Investigational Material
 
 The adhesive is intended for contact with intact 
skin for a prolonged period.
The tape is supplied non-sterile in multiple si zes and lengths. The tape does not contain any 
medicinal substances, biological tissues, or blood products.
is a general purpose m edical adhesive tape for medical applications used primarily to 
secure dressings, lightweight tubing, and devices to skin.
2.2 Summary of Previous Studies
The studies completed to assess the biocom patibility of were selected based on the 
international standard ISO 10993-1: 2003 (E), Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 
1: Evaluation and Testing.
is categorized as a surface device having prolonged contact (24 hours to 30 days) on 
intact skin.  Tests included Cytotoxicity by MEM Elution and Agar Overlay methods per ISO 10993-5; Primary skin irritation in rabbits (24 hour contact time) per ISO 10993-10; and a 
Guinea Pig Maximization test using saline and sesame oil extracts of the tape per ISO 
10993-10.  In addit ion, a Human Repeat Insult Patch Test (HRIPT) was conducted (n=212) 
on the tape.  The tape was determined to be non -cytotoxic, non-irritating, and non-sensitizing.
A toxicology risk assessment of the materials used in has been completed by 3M 
Toxicology & Compliance Solutions, 3M Medical Department, and all materials are considered safe for human use.
During the development of , a total of 21 clinical studies have been conducted on 
various, but similar, formulations of t he product and there have been no adverse events 
noted on .  There have been a total of 272 healthy adult volunt eers in these trials. A 
number of healthy adult volunteers may have participated in more than one 3M internal 
clinical study. To date there have not been any studies conducted on healthy infants or 
children.
2.3 Risk/Benefit Summary
Tapes are considered to be low risk medical devices that are commonly used throughout healthcare and in home use, and on patients of various ages, with few problems. Potential risks to the subject include possible itch, slight discomfort during removal, erythema, and skin stripping, typically without any long-term effects. No subject is expected to endure more than slight discomfort upon removal of the tape. There are no medical benefits for a subject who participates in this study.

The product to be tested is an investigati onal adhesive tape for medical use and will be used 
as intended. There will be no control tape for this study. Tape will be provided in 1-inch wide widths and will be applied as 1-inch by 1.5-inch strips onto the back of the subject.  The tapewill be allowed to remain in place for approximately 24 hours before removal. The tape will be applied and removed according to the procedures listed in Appendix 1.
2.5 GCP and Regulatory Requirements
3M does not consider  to be a significant risk investigational device.  This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, GCP, and applicable state and federal regulations, including 45 CFR 160 & 164 (Authorization for Use/Disclosure of PHI), 21 CFR 
812.2 [b] (Investigational Device Exemptions-Abbreviated Requirements), and 50 (Informed 
Consent).
2.6 Study Population
Up to 24 subjects that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study.  During recruitment, an attempt will be made to balance the genders as much as possible.Any subjects that withdraw or are withdrawn from the study may be replaced to ensure that a total of 20 subjects complete the study.  (Up to 24 total subjects are anticipated to be screened and potentially enrolled in the study to reach a final enrollment target of 20 subjects.) Subjects will be healthy infant volunteers of either gender, between the ages of 6 months and 4 years of age, and free of skin proble ms on the intrascapular region of the back.
Refer to Inclusion/Exclusion criteria listed in Section 4.0 for more detail.
3.0 Study Objectives and Purpose
The objective of this study is to determine the relative .  A three-prong 
multidimensional evaluation consisting of expert grader, subject discomfort assessment, and laboratory assessments will be used.  One pre-study visit will take place up to 7 days prior to the start of the study. The study will be conduc ted over two days with one tape sample applied and 
removed.  Assessments will be taken on the final day. This is to mimic a normal tape application in health care practice.  Assessments will be compared to those taken in a previous study.
4.0 Study Design
4.1 Study Type
This will be a prospective study with a multidimensional evaluation, consisting of skin assessments made by an expert skin grader, subject discomfort assessments performed by an expert discomfort grader, and laboratory assessments (hair and skin cell quantification) on the removed tapes.
4.2 Primary and Secondary Endpoints
The primary endpoint will be the change in the subject discomfort (from baseline to the final assessment) using the FLACC (face, legs, activity, cry, consolability) scale.

Authorization
4.6.1 Study Termination
3M or the Investigator has the right to discontinue the study at any time for medical 
and/or administrative reasons.  As far as possible, this should occur after mutual consultation.
4.6.2 Subject Discontinuation
The Investigator may discontinue individual subjects from the study at any time.  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time.  The Investigator will 
provide a written report on the appropriate CRF describing the reason for discontinuance and the date of discontinuance.
A subject who discontinues may be replaced with another qualified subject who will 
follow the same treatment scheme as the discontinued subject in order to finish with a minimum of 20 subjects.
4.6.3 Subject Revocation of Authorization to Use and Disclose PHI
In order to implement a valid revocation of authorization, the subject’s parent or legal 
representative must make the request in writing to cyberDERM, inc., 867 Sussex 
Blvd., Broomall, PA 19008.  The revocation cannot stop the use or disclosure of 
information that has been collected prior to the revocation, which is needed to ensure complete and accurate study results and is required by law or government regulation (e.g. reporting adverse events, etc.).  Revocation of an authorization may not be used to withhold normal medical care from the subject but may make the subject ineligible to receive the study treatment or care.
4.7 Investigational Material Accountability
3M requires Investigators to maintain accountability and adequate inventory security of the investigational material at all times. The Investigator or designee will:
!Complete a Confirmation of Release and Receipt of Clinical Supplies form and maintain and account for inventory on the Investigational Material Disposition form.
!Keep investigational materials in a secure storage area, accessible only to authorized individuals.
!Dispense investigational material only to subjects properly enrolled into the study.
!Return all unused investigational materials to 3M at the end of the study, or dispose of as agreed upon.

Source data includes any original documents, data, and records where any study data is first 
recorded (e.g., hospital records, patient charts, laboratory notes, questionnaires, 
photographs, and consent forms).
For this study, paper case report forms (CRFs) will be provided by cyberDERM for each 
subject.  All required data will be recorded in the CRFs.  If study-related data are recorded for the first time directly into the CRF, then the CRF is the source document.  Completed CRFs will be reviewed by the site monitor to ensure accuracy and consistency of subject data.
Any discrepancies found during CRF review are to be clarified by the Investigator or 
designee.
4.9 Protocol Modifications
4.9.1 Protocol Amendments
The party initiating an amendment must confirm it clearly in writing using the 
Amendment/Administrative Revision form.  It must be signed and dated by 3M, and, in the case of a significant amendment, the Investigator.  A significant amendment means one that affects the safety, rights or welfare of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study.
3M will submit protocol amendments to the Investigator for submission to the IRB for 
pre-approval.  3M will also notify the Investigator when a protocol amendment may 
be implemented (post IRB approval).
4.9.2 Protocol Deviations
A deviation is a departure from the protocol.
A protocol deviation is only for an individual subject.  Protocol deviations are 
documented on a Protocol Deviation CRF.
Deviations that potentially affect 1) subject safety, rights or welfare, 2) data integrity 
or 3) compromise the statistical analysis of the study require immediate 
communication to 3M; the Investigator must contact the 3M study monitor within 24 
hours of occurrence (651-736-4685).  A Protocol Deviation Form must be completed by the Investigator and include the type of deviation and a description of the circumstances surrounding the deviation.
Deviations which are made to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an 
emergency must be reported to the IRB within 24 hours after the Investigator learns of the occurrence.
4.10 Computerized Systems
The computer software systems that will be used to create, modify, maintain, archive, 
retrieve, or transmit data will be:  eMatrix, SAS, Excel, Word, Outlook, and Minitab.
Electronic study documents will be stored in eMatrix.

5.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria
Subjects will be infants or children of either gender who meet the following criteria:
1. Who are healthy and who have intact skin at the test site with a baseline score of 0 for 
erythema
2. Who are between the ages of 6 months – 4 years of age (48 months)
3. Who have a Fitzpatrick Skin Type of I, II or III4. Whose parent or legal representative agrees to not use any products (i.e. topical 
medications, creams, powders or ointments) on the test sites for 24 hours prior to the 
study start date
5. Whose parent or legal representative agrees to sponge bathe their child during the 
study but agrees to not bathe their child 1 hour before each visit.
6. Whose parent or legal representative agrees to not soak the tape during a sponge 
bath.  If the site gets wet, parent or legal representative agrees to pat their child’s back dry (no rubbing).
7. Whose parent or legal representative is willing to sign the Informed Consent Form (with 
photo release) and HIPAA Authorization.
5.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria
Subjects who are specifically excluded from this study are subjects:
1. Who are known to be developmentally delayed
2. Who have any known allergy or sensitivity to tapes
3. Who have sunburn, skin infection or scars, moles, or other blemishes on the back that 
would obscure grading of the test site
4. Who have had any exposure to other topical medications, creams, powders, or 
ointments on the test sites 24 hours prior to the start of the study
5. Who have had a strep infection within the 2 weeks prior to the start of the study
6. Who have a history of uncontrolled diabetes, psor iasis, any active dermatitis, or recent 
history of dermatitis or skin reactions
7. Has participated in any study in the last 2 weeks, or are currently participating in 
another study, or are scheduled to participate in another study during this study period.
8. Has any other skin disorders that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with 
the study results or will increase undue risk for the child.
5.3 Subject Assent and Parent Consent
Active written assent will not be obtained because the subjects are not of the appropriate 
intellectual age (i.e., typically 7 years of age and older).
The Investigator must ensure that written informed consent to participate in the investigation is 
obtained before including any individual as a subject in the investigation.  The Investigator must provide the prospective subject’s parent or legal representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate, and minimize the possibility of coercion or undue 
influence. The process is designed to 1) gi ve the subject’s parent or legal representative all 
the information that they need, 2) ensure that the subject’s parent or legal representative 
understands the information and 3) give the subject’s parent or legal repres entative a chance 
to consider study participation.  The process should permit the subject’s parent or legal representative to ask questions and exchange information freely.

7.0 Assessment of Efficacy
7.1 Efficacy Parameters
The following efficacy parameters will be computed for each subject:
7.1.1 Tape Lift
!Measured prior to tape removal at T24 by an expert grader.
7.1.2
Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Pain Assessment
!At T24, just prior to tape removal (for approximately 2 minutes), and following tape 
removal (for approximately 2 minutes), the subject will be videotaped to document their reaction at baseline, upon removal, and after removal of the tape.
!Video recordings will be sent to the 3M, where the subject’s reaction will be scored by a discomfort expert (identified by 3M), using the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Pain Assessment. The discomfort expert will be blinded as to whether the video is from baseline or the removal of the tape.
!Video recordings will be made of the subject’s full anterior side.  The removal of the tape will be completed only when the infant appears to be relaxed (not anxious or stressed).

7.2.1 Lift Assessment
Lift Assessment will be taken prior to removal at T24. Lift will be assessed according 
to the following scale:
0 = No lift
0.5 = Corner lift only (up to four corners)
1 = 1-25% lift
2 = 26-50% lift
3 = 51-75% lift
4 = 76-99% lift5 = Tape is missing
7.2.2 Discomfort Assessment
At T24, just prior to tape removal (for approximately 2 minutes), and following tape 
removal (for approximately 2 minutes), the subject will be videotaped to document their reaction at baseline, upon removal, and after removal of the tape.  The video recordings will be sent to the 3M, where the subject’s reaction will be scored by a discomfort expert (identified by 3M) using the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Pain Assessment.  Video recordings will be made of the subject’s full anterior side.  The removal of the tape will be completed only 
when the infant appears to be relaxed (not anxious or stressed).
7.2.3 Laboratory Assessments
The tape sample that has been removed from each subject with gloved hands will be 
placed in a Petri dish and shipped to 3M for further laboratory testing, including quantifying the amount of hair and skin cells removed by the tape samples.  Hair counts will be completed on each tape specimen.  The skin cells will be quantified using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) colorimetric detection and protein quantification on the same tape samples. The samples will be identified by screening number and subject number. If samples fell off during the 24 hour wear, the samples will not be retrieved.
7.2.4 Expert Skin Grader Assessments
At T0 (Baseline), Expert Skin Grader Assessments of Erythema will be made prior to 
the first tape application.  At T24,  Expert Skin Grader Assessments will be made 
approximately 30 minutes after the tape is removed. If the sample is missing at T24, no assessment will be conducted.

Clinical and Non-Clinical: CLIN- INDEX-3M-SPON-US-05-014050If any of these irritation parameters appear to be highly exacerbated, more than normally associated with use conditions in this type of population, the event will be recorded as an adverse event.  This can only be determined by the investigator.
8.3 Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for identifying adverse events that occur to each subject 
throughout the study and follow-up period.  An adverse event can occur at any time during the conduct of the study, in any phase of the study or after the study is completed. An adverse event can be identified by the Investigator or reported by the subject.
For this study, any non-device adverse events (e.g. common cold, falls, systemic 
illnesses, etc.) will not be recorded.   All device-related and serious adverse events will need 
to be reported to the sponsor.
Note: The Federal Privacy Rule (HIPAA) specifically permits the use and disclosure of 
protected health information “without written authorization of the individual” when used for public health activities such as reporting adverse events, tracking FDA-related products, enabling recalls, repairs, replacements, lookbacks, or conducting post-market surveillance [45 CFR 164.512].  This use and disclosure is subject to the minimum necessary standard, i.e. “the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended use, disclosure, or request” [45 CFR 164.502(b)(1)].
Definitions:
!Adverse event
(AE) means any undesirable clinical occurrence in a subject whether or 
not it is considered to be device related.
!Device-related adverse event (i.e. adverse device effect) is an AE considered by the 
Investigator to have a reasonable likelihood of being associated with the 
investigational device.
!Serious adverse device effect is a device effect that has a serious adverse effect on 
health or safety causing hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, or is life threatening or causes death.
!Unanticipated adverse device effect
is any serious adverse device effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to rights, safety and welfare of subjects.
Recording and Reporting
The Investigator records each material-related adverse event on an Adverse Event CRF. 
Documentation includes the description, severity, seriousness, date of onset and resolution, relationship to the investigational material, action taken and outcome.
The Investigator must promptly report an adverse device effect to the 3M study monitor.  If the 
adverse device effect is also considered by the Investigator to be serious and/or unanticipated, the Investigator must report it to the IRB as soon as possible and within IRB requirements.

9.0 Statistics
9.1 Data Sets Analyzed
Data obtained for all subjects that enter the study and have samples applied will be analyzed 
in this study.
9.2 Statistical Methods
9.2.1 Efficacy Analyses
The BCA results will be summarized, and log-transformed data will be compared to a 
previous study.
Cumulative FLACC scores will be calculated from this study and compared to a 
previous study.
Summary statistics will be provided for all variables tested in the study. This includes 
tables with mean, median, std dev, min, and max, as well as frequency distribution tables when needed.
9.2.2 Safety Analyses
The analyses listed above for erythema, denudation, and discomfort will be carried out 
as the safety analyses.
9.3 Sample Size Justification
The sample size of 20 is needed so that the one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test will have 
approximately 80% power to detect a p>0.5 assuming that the observed p=0.85 with significance level set at 0.05, where p=probability of observing a higher ordinal FLACC score 
in one sample than the other sample when comparing to a previous study.
9.4 Procedures for Accounting for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data 
Subjects who do not comply with the requirements of this study will be dropped.  Any subject 
who withdraws from this study or is dr opped for cause may be replaced to ensure that a 
minimum of 20 subjects complete the study. In the event that lost subjects have a material effect on the analysis of the study and the importance of the conclusions drawn from the study, efforts will be made to consult with the study requester and a statistician to discuss how to best address the issues.
9.5 Deviations to Statistical Plan
Any deviation(s) from the original statistical plan should be described and justified in the final 
report, as appropriate.

Name of Finished Product: Tolperisone hydrochloride Name of Active Ingredient: Tolperisone hydrochloride Study Title: Dose Ranging Study of Tolperisone in Acute Muscle Spasm of the Back, “STAR Study” Study Number: 201 Study Phase: Phase 2  Study Background: Tolperisone hydrochloride (tolperisone) is a centrally active muscle relaxant that is an (non-opioid) investigative drug in the US. It has been in therapeutic use elsewhere throughout the world since the 1960s. In many European countries, the highest approved dose is 450 mg/day (150 mg TID), while in some countries (e.g., Switzerland), doses of 600 mg/day are approved. Doses of up to 900 mg/day have been studied in clinical trials of adults with spasticity (see Investigator’s Brochure). The Phase 2 study with tolperisone is designed as a dose-ranging study to identify the recommended Phase 3 dose to aid in supporting the proposed claim of relief of back pain due to muscle spasm of acute onset. Doses for the Phase 2 study are based on years of historical use of tolperisone for treatment of painful muscle spasms where the therapeutic dose is 300 to 450 mg per day.  Study Design: This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of the efficacy and safety of tolperisone or placebo administered as multiple doses three times a day (TID) in approximately 400 male and female subjects experiencing back pain due to or associated with muscle spasm. The tolperisone groups consist of dose levels of 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg administered TID in doses of 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg for 14 days, with a visit at 28 days as follow-up. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive matching placebo tablets TID for 14 days with a follow-up visit at Day 28. Subject participation will be approximately 4 weeks.  Subjects will be screened for eligibility for participation in the study at the Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Day 1) after reviewing and signing the informed consent form. Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be randomized into the study (Day 1) and begin dosing this same day. If needed, screening assessments may be completed up to 3 days prior to Day 1 (first dose) as described below.   It is highly recommended to complete all screening and baseline assessments on the same day the subject presents at the site due to their acute pain relief needs.  However, to accommodate real world logistical issues and time constraints of either the subject or site, the site has the flexibility to allow completion of screening assessments within 3 days (-3 days) prior to Day 1

Page 7 of 60 baseline assessments, deployment of study-provisioned smartphone/download of trial application on subject’s smartphone, randomization, and first dose (in that order).  After completing all screening and baseline assessments by/on Day 1, subjects will receive all study drug and rescue medication (acetaminophen 500 mg) and will be instructed to begin taking their study drug that same day. Depending on the time of their clinic visit, they should be instructed to begin dosing with either the midday dose (12-2 pm) or the evening dose (6-8 pm). Subjects will be instructed to continue taking study drug TID through Day 14 and complete dosing dairy and daily electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (ePRO) assessments. Subjects will return to the clinic to complete the procedures listed in the Schedule of Procedures on Day 4 (±1 day; Visit 2) and Day 14 (+1 day, End of Treatment [EOT] visit, Visit 3). Subjects must also return to the clinic for a follow-up visit on Day 28 (+3 days, 2-week follow-up visit, Visit 4). For all subjects, safety laboratory assessments will be performed on Day 1 (Screening/Baseline visit, -3 to 0 days) and Day 14 (Visit 3). In addition, a sample for genotyping will be collected on Day 1 (Screening/Baseline visit). For select sites with additional consenting subjects, pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on Day 4 (Visit 2).  
 Primary Objective: • To assess the efficacy of tolperisone daily doses 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg for relief of pain due to acute back muscle spasm.

Page 8 of 60 Secondary Objectives: • To assess the safety and tolerability of tolperisone in subjects with pain due to acute back spasm. • To determine the onset of action of tolperisone in treatment of pain due to acute back spasm. • To determine the duration of pain relief of tolperisone in treatment of pain due to acute back spasm. • To determine the need for rescue medication when treated with various doses of tolperisone for pain due to acute back spasm. Endpoints: Data for primary efficacy analysis will be assessed during the clinic visits by the subject on the study-provisioned tablet provided to each site for use at baseline, and at Days 4 and 14. Additional efficacy endpoints and dosing will be collected daily at specified times from the subjects via a smartphone/trial application for ePROs. At baseline, and at Days 4 and 14, efficacy endpoints will be assessed during the clinic visit on the study-provisioned tablet provided to each site. See the Schedule of Procedures for all assessments to be conducted during the study. For the endpoints below, baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to the first dose of study drug. Primary Endpoint:  • Subject-rated pain due to acute back spasm using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; 0-10 scale, from no pain to worst possible pain) on Day 14 “right now”.  Secondary Endpoints: Efficacy Endpoints • Subject-rated pain due to acute back spasm using an NRS (0-10 scale, from no pain to worst possible pain) on Day 4 “right now”. • Subject rating of medication helpfulness (SRMH; 1-5 scale, from poor to excellent) on Days 4 and 14. • Subject-rated NRS (0-10 scale) of pain due to acute back spasm on Days 1 to 14; average over past 12 hours. • Subject-rated NRS (0-10 scale) of pain due to acute back spasm on Days 1 to 14, average over the past hour. • Subject-rated NRS (0-10 scale) of average pain due to acute back spasm on rest or movement, rated at the end of the day on Days 1 to 14. • Time to relief of pain due to acute back spasm using subject-rated NRS (0-10 scale) on Days 1 to 14. • Clinician’s Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) (1–5 scale) at baseline (Day 1). • Clinician’s Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) (1-7 scale from worse to marked improvement) on Days 4 and 14. • Patient’s Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) (1-5 scale) at baseline (Day 1). • Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) based on subject’s global assessment

Subjects are to refrain from vigorous physical activity, heat and ice packs, and non-pharmacological therapies (e.g., acupuncture, chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy, TENS, physiotheraphy) during Days 1 to 14.  Test Product, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Dose Regimen: Tolperisone 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg tablets and matching placebo will be provided for the study by the Sponsor. Dosing will be three times a day, with a single tablet administered at each dose for a daily dose of 150, 300, 450, and 600 mgs per day. Subjects should be instructed to dose at 6-8 am, 12-2 pm, and 6-8 pm daily for 14 days. Subjects will be prompted via reminders on their smartphone/trial application to take their study drug at least 1 hour before and within 2 hours of the morning and evening assessments. The subjects will be instructed to swallow the tablets whole, with approximately 4-6 ounces of water.  • Subjects in Group A (n=80) will be randomized to receive (1) 50 mg tolperisone tablet, TID for 14 days, for a total daily dose of 150 mg. • Subjects in Group B (n=80) will be randomized to receive (1) 100 mg tolperisone tablet administered TID for 14 days, for a total daily dose of 300 mg. • Subjects in Group C (n=80) will be randomized to receive (1) 150 mg tolperisone tablet administered TID for 14 days, for a total daily dose of 450 mg. • Subjects in Group D (n=80) will be randomized to receive (1) 200 mg tolperisone tablet administered TID for 14 days, for a total daily dose of 600 mg. • Subjects in Group E (n=80) will be randomized to receive (1) placebo tablet administered TID for 14 days. Duration of Treatment: The total duration of study participation will be approximately 4 weeks, including Screening and Follow-up. Study drug treatment will be administered for 14 days. Safety Assessments: Adverse Events: Adverse events will be captured from the time of first dose (Day 1) until the final clinic visit (i.e., Day 28 follow-up visit [Visit 4] or, if applicable, Early Termination (ET) Visit). Pregnancy Test: A urine pregnancy test will be performed at Day 1 (Visit 1, Screening/Baseline visit, -3 to 0 days) and at Days 14 (Visit 3) and 28 (Visit 4) for females of childbearing potential. A positive pregnancy test will automatically disqualify the subject from further participation in the trial. Serum Chemistries, Hematology and Urinalysis: Blood will be collected for serum chemistries and hematology and urine will be collected for urinalysis at the Screening/Baseline visit, (Day 1, -3 to 0 days) and at the EOT/ET visit (Visit 3, Day 14). A blood sample will be collected at baseline for DNA genotype testing for CYP450 2D6 polymorphism. Subjects will not be informed of the results of the genotype

Page 14 of 60 testing since it is solely for research purposes to determine the phenotype of the enzymes responsible for metabolism of tolperisone.  No other DNA testing will be performed. Vital Signs: Vital signs, including supine and standing blood pressure, sitting heart rate (after approximately 3 minutes at rest), respiratory rate, and body temperature will be collected at Screening/Baseline (Day 1, -3 to 0 days), and at Days 4, 14, and 28 (All Visits). Weight and height will be measured at Screening/Baseline (Visit 1, Day 1, -3 to 0 days) only. Electrocardiogram: Twelve-lead ECG recording will be collected at Screening/Baseline (Day 1, -3 to 0 days) and EOT/ET (Visit 3, Day 14). Statistical Plan and Methods:  Sample Size: The sample size for this study was determined from results of two previous studies. The first was a study in subjects with acute upper back, neck, or shoulder spasm and pain, which showed a difference of 0.4 in the average of Day 1 through Day 7 between the placebo and active groups, and standard deviations (SDs) between 1.76 and 1.93 (across placebo and active groups respectively; Collaku, 2017). A sample size of 400 subjects (80 per group) would provide at least 80% power to detect a difference of 0.9 between the placebo and treatment groups in the NRS scale, assuming a two-sample t-test at the 5% level of significance and a pooled SD of 2.0. This sample size assumes an effect size of 0.45 (0.9/2.0 = 0.45, using the formula Effect Size = Mean/SD), which is larger than that seen in the reference study but consistent with that seen in a second study. A second previous study in subjects with acute musculoskeletal spasm associated with low back pain showed effect sizes ranging from 0.57 to 0.62 for lumbar cinelgasia, based on a treatment difference of 9.6 at Day 3, with SDs of 15.5 (treated group) and 16.7 (placebo group) (Chandanwale, 2011). This study demonstrated effect sizes ranging from 1.1 to 1.6, based on a difference of 24.2 at Day 14 with SDs of 15.1 (treated group) and 23.0 (placebo group). The effect size of the current study is expected to be similar to that in Chandanwale, though sample size estimates have been made more conservative to provide sufficient power to detect smaller differences. Though the primary comparison of interest in this study is Day 14, the study is sufficiently powered to detect a treatment difference at Day 4 based on effect sizes ranging from 0.35 to 0.45.

Page 15 of 60 Statistical Plan and Methods:  Efficacy Analysis:  The primary efficacy endpoint is subject-rated pain “right now” due to acute back spasm using an NRS (0-10) scale, from no pain to worst possible pain for the clinic visit on Day 14. This analysis will be performed using a linear test of trend across doses, using a mixed effect model for repeated measures. The model will include treatment and time as fixed effects, the treatment by time interaction, and the baseline NRS rating as a covariate. Differences in linear trend for each dose level versus placebo will be presented with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values. The analysis performed for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the NRS at Day 4. Additional analyses for secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted using repeated measures and analysis of covariance for continuous variables, a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for categorical variables, and Kaplan-Meier analysis for time to pain relief. Safety Analysis: Safety measures will be summarized using descriptive statistics and listed for each subject. Safety analysis will be based on all subjects randomized who receive at least 1 dose of the study medication. The safety analysis will evaluate AEs and additional safety parameters. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one AE will be summarized by body system, preferred term, and treatment. If appropriate, AEs will also be summarized by intensity and relationship to study drug. Serious adverse events (SAEs), if any, will be tabulated. Additional safety parameters will be assessed from summaries of physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs and vital signs. The 12-lead ECG results will be categorized as normal, clinically significant abnormal, and not clinically significant abnormal. Hematology, chemistry and urinalysis laboratory test results will be categorized relative to the normal ranges. The changes from baseline for each of these parameters from Screening to EOT will be presented. Complete listings and summary tables for all safety information including AEs, laboratory safety data, ECG, vital signs and physical examination will be included in the study report.

Central Laboratory The central laboratory, ACM Global Central Laboratory ("ACM'), for serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis will be used.  The genotype laboratory, Machaon Diagnostics, (Machaon), testing for CYP450 2D6 polymorphism will be used. 7. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY 7.1. Introduction Tolperisone, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, is widely used in Europe, Asia, and South America for the treatment of abnormally increased muscle tone. Tolperisone is an (non-opioid) oral formulation presented as film-coated tablets, and is being developed by Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the treatment of symptoms associated with acute and painful back muscle spasms. The mechanism of action of tolperisone is not fully characterized. The most prominent effect of tolperisone is its inhibitory action on pathways of spinal reflexes. It suppresses the mono and polysynaptic reflex transmission by both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic mechanisms. Tolperisone has sodium (Na+) and, to a lesser extent, calcium (Ca2+) channel blocking activity. It inhibits, in a relatively selective manner, voltage-gated Na+ channels. However, even with high tolperisone concentrations, channel blockade remains incomplete and reversible. Although it demonstrated significant binding to a variety of receptors in vitro, including the sigma σ1 receptor, the functional effects of tolperisone at these targets is not known. In general, tolperisone causes a frequency-dependent decrease in action potential amplitude of axonal membranes. Excitability is then decreased, especially in cases of pathologically increased reflex activity. It has been proposed that tolperisone may exert a stronger inhibitory effect on sensory axons than motor axons, as indicated by inhibition of nociception-induced reflex muscle contraction and withdrawal in animal models. Vasodilatory properties of tolperisone have been repeatedly described in clinical studies. The mechanism of the blood flow-enhancing effect of 
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 23 of 60 tolperisone has not been investigated systematically; however, Ca2+-channel antagonism, or the drug’s modest anti-alpha-adrenergic effects may be involved.  Animal toxicity has been extensively profiled and in repeat dosing study in rats with daily doses of 100 mg/kg for 28 days being well-tolerated, and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) considered to be 300 mg/kg/day. No target organs of toxicity were identified. In a three-part, 28-day toxicology study in dogs, the NOAEL was established as 20 mg/kg/day. Chronic oral toxicity studies in the rat (6-month) and dog (9-month) have been reported and have shown NOAELs of 50 and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively.  Tolperisone was nonmutagenic in the Ames test and in two in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus tests. Tolperisone was, however, clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes and the in vitro mouse lymphoma TK assay. The in vitro genotoxic activity was attributed to 4-MMPPO, a degradation product of tolperisone. The ICH guidelines for genotoxic impurities require that levels remain below 10 ppm, equivalent to a daily maximum exposure of 1.5 ug. Based on daily dosing of 450 mg tolperisone, the calculated limit of 4-MMPPO is 3.3 ppm/tablet (corresponding to 1.5 µg per total daily dose). Carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice have shown no risk of carcinogenic potential. Tolperisone had no effect on fertility or in pre- and postnatal reproductive toxicity studies in rats and was non-teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetic, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies with tolperisone show the drug is highly absorbed (> 80%), widely distributed to major organs including the CNS, and excreted primarily by the kidneys. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tolperisone is rapidly converted into as many as 25 metabolites by liver microsomes from rat, dog, and human species. In vivo, both major human metabolites M4 and M5 are present at high levels in dogs. M4 is also present at high levels in the rat, but M5 is not. Tolperisone has been evaluated in five clinical studies conducted in healthy volunteers: two pharmacokinetic (PK) studies (Study 01-316-02 and Study 01-286-02); a safety and PK study (AV650-012), a drug-drug interaction study (AV650-019); and a study to assess sedative effects (Study 115). A total of 148 subjects were exposed to tolperisone in these studies. One double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy study was conducted in patients, Study AV650-018 (IND 74864) in patients with spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (108 tolperisone during double-blind, 146 tolperisone during open-label). The pharmacokinetic studies conducted with tolperisone in male and female healthy volunteers have demonstrated a roughly linear relationship between dose and exposure that is more than dose-proportional across the investigated dose range (between 150 to 450 mg administered orally in single doses). Additionally, gender has no apparent influence on tolperisone’s pharmacokinetic behavior in human subjects. In contrast, the plasma exposure in rats was approximately twice as high in females as in males for a given dose. Food appears to increase the drug’s plasma exposure slightly in humans. Tolperisone is extensively metabolized in vivo, mainly by the liver enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Moderate to potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are thus likely to cause drug interactions with tolperisone. In a Phase 1 drug-drug interaction study, the tolperisone plasma exposure increased approximately 2 fold following concomitant administration with paroxetine (a CYP2D6 inhibitor) and increased by 3- to 4- fold following concomitant administration with 
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 24 of 60 fluvoxamine (a CYP2C19 inhibitor). The CYP2D6 genotype (conferring ultra-fast, fast, intermediate and slow metabolizer phenotypes) influences tolperisone bioavailability. In one pharmacokinetic study, subjects who were classified as CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers had approximately 50% higher exposure to tolperisone following oral dosing than fast metabolizers. Overall, the bioavailability increased with decreasing metabolic activity among the four genotypes. In a driving simulation, Study 115, assessed the sedation risk tolperisone. Study 115 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose 3-way cross-over study of safety and cognitive effects of multiple doses of 150 mg tolperisone administered three times daily (TID) in 35 male and female healthy volunteers. Treatment groups included 450 mg tolperisone (150 mg TID), 30 mg cyclobenzaprine (i.e., 10 mg administered three times daily), and placebo. Subjects received 3 days of each treatment. In this study, tolperisone was equivalent to placebo at Tmax, showed no drug accumulation or sedation effects following multiple doses, and showed no next day residual effects. The most common AE across all studies was headache, occurring in 14.2% of subjects in healthy volunteer studies and 15.3% of subjects in patient studies. No other AEs occurred in more than 5% of subjects in either group of studies. This Phase 2 study will explore the efficacy and safety of tolperisone at doses up to 600 mg administered TID for 14 days in patients with acute and painful back muscle spasms.  7.2. Drug Profile Full details of tolperisone pre-clinical and clinical safety and tolerability data are contained in the Investigator's Brochure. 7.3. Rationale  7.3.1. Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of the efficacy and safety of tolperisone or placebo administered as multiple doses TID in approximately 400 male and female subjects experiencing back pain due to or associated with muscle spasm. The tolperisone groups consist of dose levels of 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg administered TID in doses of 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg for 14 days, with a visit at 28 days as follow-up. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive matching placebo tablets TID for 14 days with a follow-up visit at Day 28. Subject participation will be approximately 4 weeks.  
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 25 of 60 The study design provides unbiased (through randomization) observations of the efficacy and safety of tolperisone over a range of doses (150 to 600 mg/day) administered for two weeks, as appropriate for acute back spasms and based on prior studies. 
 See the Schedule of Procedures in Table 2. 7.3.2. Tolperisone Dose Levels Tolperisone 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg tablets and matching placebo will be provided for the study by the Sponsor. Dosing will be three times a day/TID, with a single tablet administered at each dose for a total daily dose of 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg per day. Subjects should be instructed to dose at 6-8 am, 12-2 pm, and 6-8 pm daily for 14 days. Subjects who are experiencing significant pain following randomization will be allowed to take a single tablet of acetaminophen 500 mg up to three (3) times per day as a rescue medication. Rescue medication will be captured on the study-provisioned smartphone/trial application.  Subjects are not to take rescue medication on clinic visit days, Day 4 (Visit 2) and Day 14 (Visit 3). Doses for the Phase 2 study are based on many years of historical use of tolperisone for treatment of painful muscle spasms where the therapeutic dose is generally 300 to 450 mg per day. In addition, the total daily dose of 600 mg was selected to explore a higher dose range to optimize efficacy without impacting safety.  A previous clinical study (AV650-018) conducted in subjects with multiple scelerosis-associated spasticity using doses up to 900 mg/day for up to 48 weeks did not show an increase in adverse events.

Subjects with diastolic blood pressure less than 50 mmHg or greater than 105 mmHg; sitting heart rate less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) or greater than 110 bpm (after approximately 3 minutes at rest); or heart rate by ECG less than 50 or greater than 110 bpm at Screening. 9.3. Withdrawal Criteria Subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Reasons that subjects may discontinue or be withdrawn from the study may include, but are not limited to: • AEs • Subject request • Investigator decision • Protocol non-compliance • Study termination by the Sponsor or Institutional Review Board (IRB).  If a subject is withdrawn from the study, all efforts will be made to complete the Visit 3 (EOT) procedures at an Early Termination visit (see Section 11.2.4). All information, including the reason for withdrawal, should be reported on the applicable pages of the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 31 of 60 For subjects who are lost to follow-up, three documented attempts will be made to contact the subject for follow-up information, including reason for discontinuation and follow-up of AEs.  Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 10. STUDY DESIGN 10.1. Summary of Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of tolperisone administered TID in approximately 400 male and female subjects experiencing back pain due to or associated with muscle spasm. The tolperisone groups consist of dose levels of 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg administered TID in doses of 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg for 14 days, with a visit at 28 days as follow-up. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive matching placebo tablets TID for 14 days. Subject participation will be approximately 4 weeks.  Subjects will be screened for eligibility for participation in the study at Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Day 1) after reviewing and signing the informed consent form. Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be randomized into the study (Day 1) and begin dosing this same day. If needed, screening assessments may be completed up to 3 days prior to Day 1 (first dose) as described below.  It is highly recommended to complete all screening and baseline assessments on the same day the subject presents at the site due to their acute pain relief needs.  However, to accommodate real world logistical issues and time constraints of either the subject or site, the site has the flexibility to allow completion of screening assessments within 3 days (-3 days) prior to Day 1 baseline assessments, deployment of study-provisioned smartphone/download of trial application on subject’s smartphone, randomization, and first dose (in that order).  After completing all screening and baseline assessments by/on Day 1, subjects will receive all study drug and rescue medication (acetaminophen 500 mg) and will be instructed to begin taking their study drug that same day. Depending on the time of their clinic visit, they should be instructed to begin dosing with either the midday dose (12-2 pm) or the evening dose (6-8 pm). Subjects will be instructed to continue taking study drug TID through Day 14 and complete dosing diary and daily ePRO assessments. Subjects will return to the clinic to complete the procedures listed in the Schedule of Procedures on Day 4 (±1 day; Visit 2) and Day 14 (+1 day, End of Treatment [EOT] visit, Visit 3). Subjects must also return to the clinic for a follow-up visit on Day 28 (+3 days, 2-week follow-up visit, Visit 4). For all subjects, safety laboratory assessments will be performed on Day 1 (Screening/Baseline visit, -3 to 0 days) and Day 14 (Visit 3). In addition, a sample for genotyping will be collected on Day 1 (Screening/Baseline visit). For select sites with additional consenting subjects, pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on Day 4 (Visit 2). Please refer to Schedule of Procedures, Table 2.

Page 32 of 60 10.2. Subject Assignment Randomization will occur only after the subject has been determined to be eligible for study participation based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following five treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio: tolperisone 50 mg TID (150 mg/day), tolperisone 100 mg TID (300 mg/day), tolperisone 150 mg TID (450 mg/day), tolperisone 200 mg TID (600 mg/day), matching placebo TID. Prior to each eligible subject’s participation, the next unique, sequentially available randomization number will be assigned to the subject using an interactive web response system. 10.2.1. Unblinding  The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinion of the Investigator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat a medical emergency of the subject. The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the Investigator, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor. However, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor and Sponsor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the interest of the subject. If it is medically imperative to know what study drug the subject is receiving, study drug should be temporarily discontinued if, in the opinion of the Investigator, continuing study drug can negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment. The Principal Investigator has the ability to unblind single subjects within EDC system for emergency unblinding purposes. The Investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Investigator in the patient’s source documentation.  10.3. Treatment Compliance  Each subject will be instructed on the importance of returning his or her study drug and rescue medication at each applicable study visit (i.e., Visits 2 and 3). The subject will also be asked to enter daily dosing information on the smartphone/trial application and study staff will review this information with the subject at each site visit to assess the subject’s compliance with the study drug and rescue medication. Any missed doses will be noted by the subject on the smartphone/trial application.  11. DAILY STUDY ACTIVITIES A complete Schedule of Procedures can be found in Table 2.  11.1. Screening The Screening/Baseline visit (Visit 1) will include procedures as listed in Table 2. The informed consent document will be discussed with each potential participant, and each individual will sign an informed consent document for the study prior to any study-specific procedures being performed. A positive test result for pregnancy, urine drug or alcohol breathalyzer will end the screening process.

STUDY PROCEDURES 12.1. Numerical Rating Scale to Assess Subject’s Pain Level due to Muscle Spasm The NRS is a scale of 0 to 10 (0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain). Subjects will use the NRS to evaluate their pain (“right now”) on Day 1 (baseline assessment) and on Days 4 (Visit 2) and 14 (Visit 3) during the clinic visit via the site study-provisioned tablet.  In addition, the NRS scale will be used by subjects for pain assessment at rest and upon movement in the evening (8–10 pm) on Days 1 to 14 recorded via the subject smartphone/use of trial application. Subjects will also be asked to rate their average pain level (NRS scale) over the past hour and the past 12 hours in the morning (8-10 am) and evening (8-10 pm) via the subject smartphone/use of trial application. 12.2. Subject Rated Medication Helpfulness (SRMH) The SRMH is a categorical scale for subjects to assess medication helpfulness, where 1=poor, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=very good, and 5=excellent. Medication helpfulness will be administered via the site study-provisioned tablet ePRO during the clinic visit on Days 4 and 14.

Page 38 of 60 12.3. Clinical Global Assessments (Clinician’s Global Impression of Severity, CGI-S and Clinician’s Global Impression of Change, CGI-C) On Day 1, the CGI-S will be conducted by the physician using a 1-5 scale (1=no pain, 2=mild pain, 3=moderate pain, 4=severe pain, and 5=worst possible pain). The CGI-C will be conducted by the physician on Days 4 (Visit 2) and 14 (Visit 3) to assess global improvement using a 7-point scale (1=Very Much Worse, 2=Much Worse, 3=Minimally Worse, 4=No Change, 5=Minimally Improved, 6=Much Improved, and 7=Very Much Improved). The Investigator/evaluator will be provided with training to ensure consistent CGI-S and CGI-C assessments across investigational centers. To the greatest extent possible, the assessments for a particular subject should be performed by the same rater/evaluator at all study visits.  12.4. Subject-Rated Global Assessments (Patient’s Global Impression of Severity, PGI-S and Patient’s Global Impression of Change, PGI-C) On Day 1 (Screening/Baseline visit), the PGI-S will be administered to assess the subject’s impression of severity of pain using a 1-5 scale (1=no pain, 2=mild pain, 3= moderate pain, 4=severe pain, and 5=worst possible pain). The PGI-C will be administered on Days 4 (Visit 2) and 14 (Visit 3) to assess the subject’s global impression of improvement using a 7-point scale (1=Very Much Worse, 2=Much Worse, 3=Minimally Worse, 4=No Change, 5=Minimally Improved, 6=Much Improved, and 7=Very Much Improved). 12.5. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  The VAS for subject-reported sleepiness will be measured in the clinic on Day 4 (Visit 2) using a visual analog scale from 0 = alert, wide awake; to 10 = very sleepy, difficulty remaining awake. 12.6. Functionality Assessment On Day 1 (Screening/Baseline visit) and on Days 4 (Visit 2) and 14 (Visit 3), the subject’s functionality based on the Fingers to Floor Distance (FFD) test will be assessed at the clinical site. FFD is measured as the distance in cm from the patients right long finger to the floor when standing with the spinal cord flexed with complete extension of knee joint. The FFD should be conducted at the same time of day for each test on Days 1, 4, and 14. The Investigator/evaluator will be provided with training to ensure consistent FFD assessments across investigational centers. To the greatest extent possible, the assessments for a particular subject should be performed by the same evaluator at all study visits.  12.7. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Disability will be assessed by the subject using the Oswestry Disability Index, which is based on 10 questions with one answer each for: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life [if applicable], social life, and traveling). This will be conducted on

Adverse Event (AE) Definitions An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. AEs occurring after the initiation of the treatment are referred to as treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product. A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. An AE may be: • A new illness, • Worsening of a concomitant illness, • An effect of the study medication including comparator; it could be an abnormal laboratory value as well as a significant shift from baseline within normal range which the Principal Investigator or medically qualified designate considers to be clinically important. Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs. They are therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical study protocol and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment. In the latter case, the condition should be reported as medical history. An SAE or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death, • Is life-threatening, • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions), • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, • Is an important medical event (including development of drug dependence or drug abuse) that may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above (according to medical judgment of the Principal Investigator). 
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 45 of 60 16.1.1. Severity Assessment  All AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the following definitions: Mild: Causing no limitation of usual activities; the subject may experience slight discomfort. Moderate: Causing some limitation of usual activities; the subject may experience annoying discomfort. Severe: Causing inability to carry out usual activities; the subject may experience intolerable discomfort or pain. Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate evaluation of the severity. 16.1.2. Causality Assessment  Investigators are required to assess the causal relationship (i.e., whether there is reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions: • Unrelated: another cause of the adverse event is more plausible; a temporal sequence cannot be established with the onset of the adverse event and administration of the study agent; or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. • Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the adverse event and administration of the study agent, but the adverse event could also be attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures. Possible related should be used when the study agent is one or several biologically plausible adverse event causes. • Definitely Related: The adverse event is clearly related to use of the study agent. 16.2. Routine Reporting  For the purposes of this study, the period of observation of AEs extends from the time of first dose (Day 1) until the final clinic visit (i.e., Day 28 follow-up visit [Visit 4] or, if applicable, Early Termination). During this period, all AEs spontaneously reported by the subject, observed by the clinical staff, or elicited by general questioning will be recorded and reported in the eCRF. Any AE that remains unresolved as of the last visit, the Investigator will attempt to resolve the event or determine the status of the event.  In the case of AEs deemed related to the Investigational Product, every effort will be made to determine the final outcome. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure subjects experiencing AEs receive appropriate follow-up, treatment where required, and that every action is well documented. Subjects will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of the study period and before the departure from the clinic site. Open-ended questions will be asked. Classification will be performed by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 21.0 or higher. 
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 46 of 60 In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., clinical sequelae or a cascade of events) should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe vomiting is known to result in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as SAE or AE in the eCRF. However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF. Pregnancy in a female subject on the study shall be reported to the Sponsor’s designee within 24 hours of the knowledge of its occurrence by the Principal Investigator or designee (for pregnancies occurring during the course of the study). Because of the possibility that the fetus/embryo could have been exposed to the study drug through the parent and for the subject’s safety, the pregnancy will be followed up to determine its outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies, or maternal and/or newborn complications. The pregnancy will be recorded and reported by the Principal Investigator or designee to the Sponsor’s designee. Pregnancy follow-up will also be properly recorded to ensure quality and completeness of the data belonging to the study drug and will include an assessment of the possible causal relation between the study drug and any pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy will be reported on a Pregnancy Report Form. 16.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  The sites will notify the sponsor and sponsor’s designee of any SAE, without regard to causality, within 24 hours after becoming aware of its occurrence.  If, during follow-up, any non-serious AE worsens and eventually meets the criteria for an SAE, that AE should be recorded as a new SAE. The initial SAE report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and SAE, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the investigational product(s). Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the AE, laboratory values received after the report, or hospital discharge summary) must be documented. All follow-up information must be reported as soon as the relevant information is available. The SAE notification should be reported by completing the SAE report form in the EDC.  An SAE will be considered “unexpected” if the AE is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the General Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. The sites will determine whether any serious unexpected related AE must be reported to the IRB. If so, the event will be reported via fax or email or as required per IRB once the Investigator or staff becomes aware of the event. The sponsor will determine whether the SAE must be reported in an expedited manner to the appropriate regulatory agencies. If so, the Sponsor will report the event to the appropriate regulatory agencies, and all participating Investigators.

Page 47 of 60 If reports of any new and unexpected AEs become available to the Sponsor during the clinical portion of this study (related or not to the present study), the Sponsor must advise the sites of those events.  17. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 17.1. General Considerations This section describes the general approaches planned to analyze the data from this study.  All efficacy and safety data will be displayed in subject data listings. Unless otherwise specified, Baseline is defined as the last observed measurement, whether scheduled or unscheduled, prior to study drug administration. All safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized by dose level. In general, categorical variables will be summarized by the frequency counts and percentages. Continuous variables will be summarized by the number of non-missing observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum values.  Unless otherwise specified, all statistical hypothesis testing will be two-sided using α = 0.05. Additional details of the planned analyses outlined here will be further described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  17.2. Determination of Sample Size The sample size for this study was determined from results of two previous studies. The first was a study in subjects with acute upper back, neck, or shoulder spasm and pain, which showed a difference of 0.4 in the average of Day 1 through Day 7 between the placebo and active groups, and SDs between 1.76 and 1.93 (across placebo and active groups respectively) (Collaku, 2017). A sample size of 400 subjects (80 per group) would provide at least 80% power to detect a difference of 0.9 between the placebo and treatment groups in the NRS scale, assuming a two-sample t-test at the 5% level of significance and a pooled SD of 2.0. This sample size assumes an effect size of 0.45 (0.9/2.0 = 0.45), using the formula Effect Size = Mean/SD), which is larger than that seen in the reference study but consistent with that seen in a second study.  A second previous study in subjects with acute musculoskeletal spasm associated with back pain showed effect sizes ranging from 0.57 to 0.62 for lumbar cinelgasia, based on a treatment difference of 9.6 at Day 3, with SDs of 15.5 (treated group) and 16.7 (placebo group) (Chandanwale, 2011). This study demonstrated effect sizes ranging from 1.1 to 1.6, based on a difference of 24.2 at Day 14 with SDs of 15.1 (treated group) and 23.0 (placebo group). The effect size of the current study is expected to be similar to that in Chandanwale, though sample size estimates have been made more conservative to provide sufficient power to detect smaller differences. Though the primary comparison of interest in this study is Day 14, the study is sufficiently powered to detect a treatment difference at Day 4 based on effect sizes ranging from 0.35 to 0.45. The power for this range of effect sizes across six different scenarios for a test of linear trend, as well as a comparison between the high dose and placebo only, is provided below, assuming n=80 in each group. Assuming an effect size of 0.4 (averaging the lowest and highest effects sizes) 
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 48 of 60 yields power estimates that are greater than 80% for each scenario tested, except when all treatment groups have identical differences from placebo. Sample size considerations are provided in Table 1.

Analysis Populations The analysis populations will be defined as follows: • Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects who receive any amount of study drug. This population will be used as the primary analysis population for all efficacy endpoints. Subjects will be included in this population based on their randomized treatment assignment.  • Safety Population: All subjects who receive any amount of study drug. This population will be used for all summaries of safety data. Subjects will be included in this population based on the actual treatment received.   • Per-Protocol (PP) Population: All randomized subjects who complete the study with no significant protocol violations that would affect the efficacy analyses. The 
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 49 of 60 PP Population will be determined prior to database lock and will be used for sensitivity analyses on the primary and select secondary endpoints. 17.4. Statistical Analysis Methods 17.4.1. Disposition and Demographics The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis population will be summarized. Subject disposition, including the number of subjects randomized, dosed, completing the Day 14 visit, and not completing the Day 14 visit by reason for withdrawal will be summarized for the ITT Population. Subject demographics and baseline characteristics will also be summarized for the ITT Population and will include age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, and weight. 17.4.2. Efficacy Analysis 17.4.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis  The primary efficacy endpoint is subject-rated pain “right now” due to acute back spasm using an NRS (0-10 scale, from no pain to worst possible pain) for the clinic visit on Day 14. This analysis will be performed using a linear test of trend across doses, using a mixed effect model for repeated measures. The model will include treatment and time as fixed effects, the treatment by time interaction, and the baseline NRS rating as a covariate. Differences in linear trend for each dose level versus placebo will be presented with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values. 17.4.2.2. Secondary Efficacy Analyses The analysis performed for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the NRS at Day 4. In addition to the primary efficacy analysis, subjects will also use the NRS scale to record pain intensity due to back spasm each day on an outpatient basis. Ratings will be averaged for both morning and evening recordings on Days 1 through Day 14 and summarized by dose level and day using descriptive statistics. Mean NRS pain intensity scores will also be plotted in a line graph over time, with associated standard errors (SEs) for Days 1 through 14. The analysis will be repeated using the evening values only for NRS scores on rest and also on movement. The comparison of each group to placebo will be conducted using a mixed effects model as described for the primary analysis. The SRMH and the Functionality Assessment: FFD will be analyzed using the same methods described for the primary endpoint. Global symptom assessments (CGI and PGI) will be summarized by the percentage of subjects reporting each individual response. The proportion of subjects in each category will be recorded at each day. The comparison of each group to placebo will be conducted using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.  Quality of sleep will be analyzed using the same methods described for the global symptom assessments. Median time (in hours) to relief of pain on Days 1 and 14 compared to baseline will be plotted using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves. Estimates of the median times will be presented along with 
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 50 of 60 their associated 95% confidence interval (CI) in a corresponding table. Treatment group comparisons will be summarized with hazard ratios and their associated 95% CI from a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model with treatment as the main effect and p-values from the generalized Wilcoxon test. Use of rescue medications will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages by generic drug name. Average daily use and total use will be tabulated using descriptive statistics. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to examine the assumption of normality. If this test is statistically significant (i.e., p ≤ 0.05) then the assumption of normality is violated and the total rescue medication consumption will be analyzed using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Results will be expressed as median (range) and p-values. However, if the assumption of normality holds (i.e., Shapiro-Wilk p-value > 0.05), then the total rescue medication consumption will be analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with randomized treatment as the main effect. Results will be expressed as means, SDs, and least squares mean difference (LSMD) and SEs with associated 95% CI, and p-values. All other secondary endpoints will be summarized by dose using descriptive statistics. In addition, the comparison of each group to placebo will be conducted using an ANCOVA model, adjusting for baseline.  17.4.2.3. Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data Efficacy analyses on the ITT Population will use the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for handling missing data. Only post-baseline values will be carried forward. Efficacy analyses on the ITT Population will also be performed using observed data only. All other analyses will be based on observed data only. 17.4.3. Safety Analysis Safety analysis will be based on all subjects randomized who receive at least one dose of the study drug. The safety analysis will evaluate adverse events and additional safety parameters.  Additional safety parameters will be assessed from summaries of physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs and vital signs.  17.4.3.1. Adverse Events Adverse events will be summarized by dose level. All adverse events will be coded from the verbatim text to the lower level term and mapped to preferred term and primary system organ class using the latest version of MedDRA. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one AE will be summarized by body system, preferred term, and dose level. If appropriate, AEs will also be summarized by severity and relationship to study drug. Serious AEs, if any, will be tabulated. Summaries that are displayed by system organ class and preferred terms will be ordered by descending incidence of system organ class and preferred term within each system organ class. Summaries displayed by preferred term only will be ordered by descending incidence of preferred term.  Summaries of the following types will be presented:  • Overall summary of number of unique TEAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs and subject incidence of TEAEs meeting various criteria;  
Protocol: 201 Amendment 1 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 02 May 2019 version 2.0 Confidential 
Page 51 of 60 • Subject incidence of TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term;  • Subject incidence of TEAEs by severity, MedDRA system organ class, and preferred term; • Subject incidence of TEAEs by relationship to study drug, MedDRA system organ class, and preferred term;  • Subject incidence of SAEs by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. Adverse events will also be presented in subject listings. The duration of AEs will be determined and included in listings, along with the action taken and outcome. 17.4.3.2. Extent of Exposure to Study Drug The total amount of study drug used by each subject as well as the mean daily amount of study drug used by each subject will be calculated. Total amount and mean daily amount of study drug will be summarized by dose level using descriptive statistics. 17.4.3.3. Clinical Laboratory Clinical laboratory results and changes from baseline will be summarized by dose using descriptive statistics for all regularly scheduled visits. For each laboratory test, individual subject values will be listed and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged. A separate listing will be provided to include all clinical laboratory values outside normal range (including Screening/Baseline Visit 1 and Day 14/ EOT examination) and will also include relevant demographic information. 17.4.3.4. Vital Signs Vital sign (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) measurements and changes from baseline will be summarized by dose using descriptive statistics for regularly scheduled visits. Measurements will also be presented in a subject data listing. 17.4.3.5. Twelve-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) Individual subject results will be summarized categorically as normal, clinically significant abnormal, and not clinically significant abnormal by dose and presented in the subject data listings. 17.4.3.6. Physical and Neurological Examination Neurological examination results will summarized in frequency tables by dose. Physical and neurological examination results will be presented in subject data listings.    17.4.4. DNA Genotyping Results will be examined and summarized for CYP450 2D6 polymorphism, dose-response, and AE profile.  17.4.5. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Details of the PK and associated statistical analyses will be included in a separate population PK Statistical Analysis Plan.

All non-shaded rows are not captured in a study-provisioned site tablet or a subject smartphone/trial application; applicable information should be entered into the eCRF. EOT = End of Treatment; ePRO = electronic Patient Reported Outcomes; PK = pharmacokinetic a Screening assessments may be completed within 3 days prior to Day 1 (-3 to 0 days). If screening assessments are completed prior to Day 1, inclusion/exclusion criteria to be re-reviewed for qualification of the subject’s enrollment into the study prior to dosing on Day 1.  b Including sex, age, race, ethnicity, body weight (kg), height (cm), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), and smoking habits. c Physical and neurological examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline (Day 1), on Day 4, and on Day 14. A physical examination only will be performed on Day 28. A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline (Day 1). All other physical examinations may be disease-specific and symptom directed. d Laboratory Evaluations include hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis on Days 1 and 14. (See ACM lab manual for further instructions.) e  DNA genotyping for CYP450 2D6 polymorphism will be collected at same time of other required blood draw on Day 1. (See Machaon lab manual for further instructions.) f For the select group of sites and subjects who will undergo PK assessments, blood samples will be drawn on Day 4. (See ACM lab manual for further instructions.)

Page 60 of 60 g Dosing will be three times per day, with a single tablet administered at each dose. Subjects should be instructed to dose at 6-8 am, 12-2 pm, and 6-8 pm for 14 days and will enter their dosing information in the eDiary on the subject’s smartphone/trial application. h Subject rating of pain using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS, a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 = no pain, and 10=worst possible pain) for the level of pain that the subject is feeling “right now” due to back spasm (primary efficacy endpoint) administered by study-provisioned tablet ePRO at baseline, and on Days 4 and 14 in the clinic. i Subject rating of medication helpfulness (SRMH): a five point scale from 1=poor to 5=excellent, administered by study-provisioned tablet ePRO on Days 4 and 14 in the clinic. j Subject rating of pain using NRS due to back spasm, measured daily in the morning 8 to 10 am and in the evening between 8 to 10 pm from Days 1 through 14, for intensity of average pain due to spasm over last 12 hours, and subject rating of average pain over the past 1 hour, all on the subject’s smartphone/trial application. k Subject rating of average pain using NRS at rest and upon movement at the end of the day (between 8 to 10 pm) on Days 1 to 14 on the subject’s smartphone/trial application.  l Functionality assessments to be administered in the clinic on Days 1, 4 and 14. FFD is measured as distance in cm from the tips of the fingers to the floor when standing with the spinal cord flexed with complete extension of knee joint. This is not captured in an electronic device.  Enter score in eCRF. m The Oswestry Disability Index (10 sections with one answer each for: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life [if applicable], social life, and traveling) will be captured by study-provisioned tablet ePRO on Days 1, 4, and 14 in the clinic.  n The use of study-provided rescue medication (acetaminophen 500 mg) taken to control their pain throughout the day will be captured in the subject’s smartphone/trial application daily from Day 1 through 14, at the end of the day. Subjects are not to take rescue medications on clinic visits on Days 4 and 14. o The subject’s quality of sleep will be captured on their smartphone/trial application starting at baseline visit in clinic and on a daily basis at home/away from clinic between 8 to 10 am for Days 1 to 14. In response to the question of “how did you sleep last night”, subject responses will be captured on a 5-point scale (from 1=not at all to 5=slept all night). p Vital signs include supine and standing blood pressure; sitting heart rate (after approximately 3 minutes at rest); respiratory rate; and body temperature on Days 1, 4, 14, and 28 (All Visits). Weight and height will be assessed at Visit 1 only.

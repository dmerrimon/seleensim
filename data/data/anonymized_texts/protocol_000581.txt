3 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem that increases risks of end-
stage renal disease (ESRD) , cardiovascular disease (CVD) , fractures, and death, and it poses 
an enormous financial burden on the US health system.1-3 Existing therapies modestl y impact 
outcomes.4-8  Novel strategies targeting CKD -specific mechanisms are urgent ly needed to 
improve health and reduce cost.   
CKD is complicated by disordered mineral metabolism, characterized by abnormal calcium and 
phosphate homeostasis, calcitriol and klotho deficiency, and elevated levels of parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).9  Elevated FGF23 is the earliest and 
most common manifestation of  disordered mineral metabolism.10  Observational studies report 
independent associations between elevated phosphate and FGF23 blood levels and increased 
risks of ESRD, CVD and death.11-13  As potential explanatory mechanisms, phosphate excess 
induces arterial stiffness due to vascular calcification, and FGF23 excess contributes directly to the pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
14,15  Together, these effects promote 
CVD events and death.12        
Dietary phosphate absorption is a modifiable determinant of phosphate and FGF23 levels.16-18  
Small studies of short duration suggest that phosphate binder s and dietary phosphate 
modification in CKD can lower phosphate and FGF23 blood levels by reducing paracellular 
absorption of phosphate in the gut.19  However, animal studies demonstrate that compensatory 
upregulation of transcellular phosphate absorption via the sodium phosphate co -transporter, 
NPT2b, reduces the efficacy of these approaches.20,21  Since nicotinamide lowers plasma 
phosphate by reducing gut expression of NPT2b,22 we hypothesize that use of nicotinamide 
combined with phosphate binders on a background of dietary phosphate moderation will most 
effectively reduce phosphate and FGF23  blood levels  in CKD.   We plan to advance this 
approach in future randomized clinical trials .   
The objective of this study is to perform a detailed physiologic study of healthy volunteers to 
assess the sho rt-term effects of nicotinamide alone, lanthanum carbonate alone, or both in 
combination,  on phosphate homeostasis.  The results from healthy volunteers will provide 
information needed for optimal design of studies for patients with CKD.  
1.2 Study Agent(s) /Devices Background and Associated Known Toxicities 
Nicotinamide will be used  at a dose of 750  mg twice daily.  Nicotinamide reduces plasma  
phosphate levels by blocking intestinal phosphate absorption through down- regulation of 
NPT2b,21 and it is well- tolerated and considered safe at high doses.23 Unlike niacin, 
nicotinamide does  not cause flushing, and is thought to be less likely to cause liver test 
abnormalities, hyperuricemia, or insulin resistance.24 In a post -hoc analysis of a randomized 
study of niacin in 327 patients with CKD stages 2 and 3,  Rao et al found that, in addition to 
reducing phosphate levels  in the blood, niacin  decreased FGF23 levels by 10.9% from baseline 
over 24 weeks, and that the magnitude of the decline in FGF23 was directly associated with the 
magnitude of decline in blood phosphate.25   
Lanthanum carbonate  at a dose of 1000  mg tw ice daily with meals will be used.  Lanthanum 
carbonate is a phosphate binder that is approved for use in patients with ESRD undergoing 
dialysis. This fixed dose was chosen because we have demonstrated that this dose safely 
reduced urinary phosphate, signifying effective phosphate binding, i n CKD stages 3 −4.26,27  
Importantly, lanthanum carbonate has been used in the hemodialysis population, with 6 -year 
long safety data demonstrating a good safety profile.28 Lanthanum carbonate has also been 
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
4 used in healthy volunteers in whom it has also been found to be safe.  As in patients with CKD, 
doses of 1000 mg three times daily in healthy volunteers achieve maximal reduction in 24 -hour 
urine.29  
1.3 Other Agents /Devices  
N/A 
1.4 Rationale  
The justification for the combined approach of binders with nicotinamide to modify plasma 
phosphate and FGF23 levels in CKD is rooted in our current understanding of the underlying biology.  However,  detailed human physiologic studies investigating the joint effects of these 
agents  on blood and urine levels of mineral metabolites are not available in health or in CKD.  
Animal data consistently demonstrate that nicotinamide blocks small bowel Pi absorption by 
decreasing protein levels of NaPi2b.
20,21 Some studies  also suggest  that nicotinamide may block 
phosphate reabsorption at the renal proximal tubule,30 but this has not been studied in detail in 
healthy volunteers or CKD patients .  Finally, the effects of nicotinamide on FGF23, PTH, 
calcitriol, and other parameters of mineral metabolism are unexplored  in humans .  Therefore, 
our proposed study will fill critical gaps that are needed to advance this novel therapeutic 
approach into future clinical trials.  
 
We propose to study healthy volunteers  because detailed data on the effects on mineral 
metabolism of nicotinamide alone or in combination with binders in this population are not available.  In the future, we will also extend the proposed studies to patients with CKD.  
 Given that 24- hr urinary phosphate excretion declines and fractional phosphate excretion rises 
with progressive CKD, an additional justification for the study of healthy volunteers is the ability 
to easily detect changes following proposed interventions in  both 24 -hour and fractional urinary 
phosphate excretion.   
  
For this detailed physiologic study, we chose to use the 2x2 factorial  study design because we 
are specifically interested  in investigating  the effects of the combined interventions as compared 
to the effects of the placebo and to each monotherapy group.   
 
We chose plasma  phosphate, 24- hour urine phosphate, fractional urinary excretion of 
phosphate (FEPI) , FGF23 and PTH as end -points because we are interested in the effects of 
the interventions on phosphate handling and mineral metabolism (See Table).  Additional end-points will include markers of bone turnover, including N terminal propeptide of Type 1 
procollagen (P1NP) and C terminal cross -linked peptide (CTX) to assess the influence of the 
interventions on bone metabolism.

4.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
 
4.1.1  Overview:  
Eligible participants will be randomized to one of the following 4 groups:  
• Lanthanum carbonate + nicotinamide  
• Lanthanum carbonate + nicotinamide placebo  
• Lanthanum carbonate placebo + nicotinamide  
• Lanthanum carbonate placebo + nicotinamide placebo  
 
4.1.2  Regimen description is presented in the table below.  
 
 
Agent   
Dose   
Route   
Schedule   
Cycle Length  
Nicotinamide  750 mg twice 
daily By mouth  Daily for 
2 weeks  
2 weeks  
(14 days)  
 Lanthanum 
carbonate  1000 mg three 
times daily 
with meals  By mouth  Daily for 
2 weeks  
 
Lanthanum carbonate is a chewable tablet. Lanthanum carbonate binds ingested 
phosphorus in the gut and therefore only works when taken with meals. Participants who 
do not eat regular meals will be instructed to take full doses with larger meals and half 
with snacks.  Nicotinamide can be taken together with lanthanum carbonate at breakfast 
and at dinner.  
4.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
 
Lanthanum carbonate may low er blood phosphate levels and can be associated with 
gastrointestinal side effe cts including nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea.   
 
Nicotinamide may lower blood phosphate levels and may be associated with other laboratory 
abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, abnormalities in liver function tests and CK.  Gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhea and heartburn may also occur.  
 The following laboratory results are  expected  study adverse events :  
• Hypophosphatemia :  Plasma  phosphate level <1.5 mg/dl  
• Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count <100,000  
• Liver function test abnormalities:  AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase> 4 
times the upper limit of the core lab (fill in precise numbers when the lab is named)  
• Elevated Creatine Kinase:  Creatine  Kinase > 4 times upper limit of normal  
 
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
8 The following symptoms are expected study adverse events : 
• Bruising   
• Bleeding   
• Severe diarrhea  
• Severe nausea  
• Flushing  
• Hives 
 
Each patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity at each study visit  (see s ection 
5.4). 
4.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Calcium carbonate tablets taken for indigestion, such as Tums, are allowed if taken once per day or less, at least 2 hours away from meals  and at a maximum dose of 1000 mg daily.  
However, participants who report using Tums often will be encouraged to try over- the counter 
Pepcid (famotidine) , Tagamet (cimetidine), or Zantac (ranitidine).  
Non-study source of vitamin B3 (niacin or nicotinamide) as a stand - alone medication or in a 
multivitamin that contains less than 100 mg/day of nicotinamide is allowed.  Larger doses are to be avoided.

5.6 Removal of Subjects from Study  
Patients can be taken off the study treatment and/or study at any time at their 
own request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for 
safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for dis continuation 
will be documented.  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
12 6.0        Response Criteria  
Plasma  Phosphate levels, CBC, LFTs, CK  will be monitored as safety 
labs through the intervention period.  
 
6.1   Safety/tolerability  
 
Analyses  of safety  will be performed for all patients having received at 
least one dose of study drug.  
7.0        ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Adverse Event Monitoring  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, ar e done to ensure the safety of s ubjects enrolled in the studies as 
well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents . Adverse 
events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial . 
Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  
 
All patients experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug/device , will be monitored until:  
 the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse event return to baseline;  
 any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  
 there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes observed; or  
 death.  
7.2 Definitions  
7.2.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal  laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
7.2.2  Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE is graded as follows:  
Mild (grade 1):  the event caus es discomfort without disruption of normal 
daily activities. 
Moderate (grade 2):  t he event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities. 
Severe (grade 3):  t he event makes the patient unable to perform normal 
daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
13 Life-threatening (grade 4):  the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event.  
Fatal (grade 5):  t he event caused death.  
7.2.3  Serious  Adverse Events  
A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any 
untoward medical occurrence that:  
7.2.3.1  Results in death.  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease 
should be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
7.2.3.2  Is life -threatening.  
(the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe).  
7.2.3.3  Requires in- patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization for ≥ 24  hours . 
7.2.3.4  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
7.2.3.5  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
7.2.3.6  Is an important medical event  
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the 
judgment of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be 
considered for reporting as a serious adverse event . The event 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.  
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; convulsions that 
may not result in hospitalization; development of drug abuse or 
drug dependency.  
7.3 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires 
Expedited Reporting  
Step 1: Identify the type of adverse ev ent   
 
Step 2: Grade the adverse event  
 
Step 3: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
14 Note : This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of 
protocol treatment . Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose 
of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) 
must also be reported accordingly.  
 
Step 4: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent . An adverse event is considered unexpected, for 
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not  listed in:  
• the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section 
of this protocol;  
• the drug package insert;  
• the current Investigator’s Brochure  
7.4 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
7.4.1  Expedited Reporting  
• The Principal Investigator must be notified within 24 hours of learning 
of any serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within 30 days of the last administration of the study drug.  
• The IRB must be notified within 10 bus iness days of “any 
unanticipated problems involving ri sk to subjects or others” 
(UPR/UPIRSO).  
The following events meet the definition of UPR:  
1. Any serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other problems), which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator was unanticipated, involved risk to subjects or others, and was 
possibly related to the research procedures.  
2. Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB -
approved protocol that alters the level of risk.  
3. Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research subject.  
4. Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, 
updated sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding that 
indicates an unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio for the 
research.  
5. Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others.  
6. Any complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or 
that cannot be resolved by the Principal Investigator.  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
15 7.4.2  Routine Reporting  
• All other adverse events - such as those that are expected, or are 
unlikely or definitely not related to the study participation-  are to be 
reported annually as part of regular data submission.  
7.5 Unblinding Procedures  
When a participant stop s his or  her blinded nicot inamide and lanthanum carbonate and 
appropriate clinical management of the participant  is dependent on knowledge of whether the 
participant  had been taking active nicotinamide or activ e lanthanum carbonate, the research 
pharmacist will unblind the investigator to the necessary arm.   
7.6 Stopping Rules  
7.6.1  Hypophosphatemia  
If a study participant has a plasma  phosphate level lower than 1.5 mg/dl, an extra visit will be 
held immediately  so the test can be repeated.  If the second lab test confirms a plasma 
phosphate level under 1.5 mg/dl, then both study medications should be stopped.  
7.6.1  Other side effects  
If a study participant develops any of the following expected study adverse events, study 
interventions will be stopped:   
• Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count <100,000  
• Liver function test abnormalities:  AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase> 
4 times the upper limit of the core lab (fill in precise numbers when the lab is 
named)  
• Elevated Creatine Kinase: Creatine Kinase > 4 times upper limit of normal  
• Severe bleeding   
• Severe diarrhea  
• Severe nausea  
• Severe Flushing  
• Hives

markers of bone turnover.  Additional stored samples will be archived for future analyses 
of newly discovered bio markers related to bone and mineral homeostasis and its 
regulation. S ubmission of samples for correlativ e studies is mandatory. The consent 
form will have a statement that will inform participants about the planned use of archived samples. Participants who chose not to have their samples archived may opt out.  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
17 9.1 Sample Collection Guidelines  
We will collect blood (serum and plasma) and urine samples . Samples will be 
labeled with the subject’s de- identified study number and collection date and 
delivered for storage to the team’ s freezers. Samples will be processed  at the 
NUCATS CRU laboratory.  
Samples  will be collected at the intervals indicated in section 5.5.   
 
9.2 Assay Methodology  
Specialized assays include: FGF23 ELISA (Immutopics , CA); N terminal propeptide 
of Type 1 procollagen (P1NP) ELISA (USCN Life Science, Houston, TX); and C 
terminal cross -linked peptide (CTX) ELISA (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Scottsdale, 
AZ).   All m easurements of specialized assays will be performed at specialized labs at

specimen will be the property of NU for publication and any licensing agreement 
will be strictly adhered to .  
 The specimens, DNA, and their derivatives may have significant therapeutic or commercial value. The Informed Consent form contains this information and 
informs the subject that there is the potential for financial gain by NU, the investigator or a collaborating researcher or entity.  
 The following information obtained from the subject's medical record may be provided to research collaborators when specimens are made available:   
• Collection time in relation to study treatment  
• Demographic data  
• De-identified stored samples  
10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a 2- week , randomized, double- blinded, 2x2 factorial design study  of 80 healthy 
volunteers (20 in each of the four treatment groups) investigating the effects of the 
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
18 interventions on changes in plasma  and urinary phosphate.  Participants will be 
randomized to one of the four groups: 1) lanthanum carbonate + nicotinamide; 2) 
lanthanum carbonate + n icotinamide placebo; 3) lanthanum carbonate placebo + 
nicotinamide; 4) lanthanum carbonate placebo + nicotinamide placebo.  
The end- points are listed in the table below:  
 
Summary of End Points  
End-Point  Primary  Secondary  Justification  
Plasma  Phosphate  X  Marker of phosphate handling  
24-hr Urine 
Phosphate  X  Marker of phosphate handling  
FePI  X  Marker of phosphate handling  
PTH  X Hormonal regulator of mineral metabolism  
FGF23   X Hormonal regulator of mineral metabolism  
P1NP   X Bone formation marker  
CTX  X Bone resorption marker  
 
10.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
Assumptions based on prior studies:  
• Data on effects of nicotinamide on blood  or urine phosphate in healthy volunteers are 
not available.  
• Similiarly, data on the combined use of the nicotinamide and lanthum carbonate are 
lacking.  
• Therefore, we relied on published data of the effects on lanthanum carbonate on 24-hour urine phosphate.  In previous short -term studies of healthy volunteers, 
lanthanum carbonate at the dose that we will use in our study decreased 24- hour 
urine phosphate by 236 to 468 mg/day.
29 The within group standard deviation of 
change in 24- hour urine phosphate ranged from 168 to 294 mg/day.29  
 
Derivation of the sample size for this study:  
Using th e PS Power and Sample Size calculator  (independent t test) , we es timated that 
a sample size of 20 participants per group will yield 80% power to detect a difference of 
273 mg/dl in urine phosphate, at α=0. 05, assuming a within group SD of the change in 
24-hour urine phosphate  of 300 mg/day .  Assuming a conservative within g roup SD of 
the change in plasma phosphate of 0.55 mg/dl, the sample size of 2 0 volunteers per 
group will allow us to detect a difference as small as 0. 50 mg/dl in plasma phosphate.   
Importantly, we based our power calculations on t -tests that compare pre to post 
intervention changes across two groups.  Because the repeated measures analyses we 
will employ using linear mixed models will reduce within- subject variability, we expect to 
have more power than is tabulated above and view the presented power calculations as 
conservative estimates.   Additionally, power for main effects analyses (effects of 
lanthanum carbonate alone and nicotinamide alone; 4 0 participants per groups; margin 
comparison) will be greater than the presented power for comparisons of dual treatment to placebo ( 20 participants per group; individual cell comparison).  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
19 10.3 Data Analyses Plans  
• We will study changes over time in absolute levels of the primary and secondary 
end-points.   
• We will use mixed -model, repeated -measures analyses to assess the changes.  
• Model terms will include:  
o fixed -effects treatment terms ( treatment group ); 
o the interaction between each treatment and time (nicotinamide x time and lanthanum carbonate x time);  
o the interaction between treatments (nicotinamide x lanthanum carbonate);  
o the interaction between treatments and time (nicotinamide x lanthanum 
carbonate x time);  
o random -effects terms, connoting individual participants.  
• If the interaction term between treatments and time (nicotinamide x lanthanum 
carbonate x time) is significant, we will compare the response in the dual 
intervention group to the placebo group.   
• If the interaction term between treatments and time (nicotinami de x lanthanum 
carbonate x time) is not significant, we will examine the main effects of each 
intervention .   
• We will use natural log transformation for end points with skewed distribution.  
• If there are significant differences (p<0.05) in age, gender and baseline eGFR 
across randomized treatment groups, we wi ll adjust for these covariates.  
• Standard descriptive  analyses will be used for safety evaluations . 
11.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Conflict of Interest  
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest with this study (patent ownership, 
royalties, or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by their institution, 
etc.) mu st have the conflict reviewed by the Feinberg School of Medicine.  All 
investigators will follow the University conflict of interest policy . 
 11.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent   
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations . The IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol.  
 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
  
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent 
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required 
by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential 
information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient 
will be asked to give cons ent to participate in the study by signing an 
IRB-approved consent form.  
 
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
20 Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form 
should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who 
conducted the informed c onsent discussion.  
11.3 Registration Procedures  
N/A 
 
11.4 Subject Compensation  
Subjects will receive compensation per study consent form. Study compensates $50.00, 
in the form of a check, for each of the 8 study visits. Total compensation, excluding reimbursement for travel expenses, is $400.00. Subjects will be required to submit proof of travel expenses (i.e., receipts) to study staff in order to be reimbursed for travel expenses.  Travel expenses will be paid out in the form of a check as well.  
11.5 Data  Management and Monitoring/Auditing  
The PI and Co- I will monitor data safety monitoring/ management . 
11.6 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, 
and well -being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall 
be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol .  
11.6.1  Emergency Modifications 
Investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the 
protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior 
IRB approval .  
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a IRB modification 
form must be completed within five (5) business days of making the 
change.  
11.6.2  Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by 
the Principal Investigator and the IRB . According to the IRB, a protocol 
deviation is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study. 
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
21 • Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
• Demonst rates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal 
regulations, State laws, or University policies.  
 
If a deviation or violation occurs without prior approval from the Principal 
Investigator, please follow the guidelines below:  
 
Protocol Deviations: De viations should be summarized and reported to 
the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 
Protocol Violations: Study personnel should report violations  within one 
(1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same 
IRB online mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems .  
11.7 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be 
originated and documented by t he Principal Investigator . It should also be noted 
that when an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or 
the potential risk to the patient, a revised consent form might be required.  
 
The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent 
to the IRB for approval prior to implementation.  
11.8 Record Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, source documents, Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitoring 
logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  
 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical 
activities and  all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and 
reconstruction of the clinical research study.  
 
Government agency regulations and directives require that the study investigator 
must retain all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a cl inical trial. In 
the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last approval of 
marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
region. In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three 
years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study.  
11.9 Obligations of Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinic al trial at the 
site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of Helsinki . The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally 
overseeing the treatment of all study patients . The Principal Investigator must  
assure that all study site personnel, including sub -investigators and other study 
staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations 
and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
22  
The Principal I nvestigator at each institution or site will be responsible for 
assuring that all the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case Report Forms. Periodically, monitoring visits will be conducted and the Principal 
Investigator will provide access to his/her original records to permit verification of 
proper entry of data. At the completion of the study, all case report forms will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and will require his/her final signature to 
verify the accuracy of the data.

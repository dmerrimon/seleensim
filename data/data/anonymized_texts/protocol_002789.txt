STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sample Size Calculation
In this non-inferiority study, the proportions of subjects meeting the prim ary endpoint are assumed to be 
% for CELSTAT and % for Surgicel; the non -inferiority margin is defined as 10%, the 1-sided Type1 
error rate () is 2.5%; and the statistical po wer (1-) is 80% . This results in a sample size of 121evaluable 
subjects per treatment group. To reach this number ,129subjects are to be randomized per treatment group.
Planned Statistical Analysis
Prim ary Endpoints
The primary effectiveness endpoint, achievement of hemostasis within 5minutes , will be investigated by a 
2-sided test for non-inferiority using logistic regression, taking into account the following covariates: study 
center, surgery type (cardiothoracic, general or vascular ), and initial bleeding severity (mild ormoderate).
Non-inferiority of CELST ATto Surgicel will be assessed using the confidence -interval approach anda 
non-inferiority margin of 10%.
The difference in the proportion of subjects having postoperative rebleeding during study participation will 
be performed using the same logistic regression model described for the primary efficacy endpoint.
Secondary Endpoints
The logistic regression model used for the primary endpoint will also be perform ed on the proportions of 
subjects with hemostasis ach ieved at 3, 7, and 10 minutes after treatment application, and on the proportion 
of subjects with intraoperative rebleeding from the TBS after achievement of hemostasis .
The TTH will be presented by Kaplan -Meier curves. In addition, a log -rank test will be performed to assess 
the difference between the distributions of TTH for CELSTAT and Surgicel.
Descriptive statistics will be generated for the secondary safety endpoints (AEs,clinical laboratory 
parameters and vital signs ).Shift tables will be generated for laboratory param eters .

7.BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
7.1Identification and Description of Investigational Device
CEL STAT is a medical device intended for use adjunctively  in surgical procedures to 
assist in the control of capillary , venous and small arterial hemorrhage when ligation or 
other conventional methods of control are impractical or ineffective . It is a gamma 
steril ized, absorbable hemostat in a flat form with textile structure of high flexibility . It 
consists enti rely of oxidized cellulose (OC) and does not contain any  excipients. The 
hemostatic effect is immediate and total hemostasis is usually  obtained within several 
minutes after application. CEL STAT is currentl y marketed in several European countries 
as Trauma stem (distributed by  Baxter Healthcare Corporation ), Traumastem TAF Light 
(distributed by   orTraumacel TAF Light (distributed by  .in the 
Czech Republic). Hereafter in this CI P, the product will be referred to as CEL STAT.
Once a pplied, CELSTAT absorbs blood, turns brown, and adheres to the wound, thereb y 
preventing thrombocy tes from being washed out and accelerating hemostasis.1
CEL STAT is 100% absorbable by the bod y and generall y can, but does not have to be, 
left in situ. Results from International Organization for Standardization ( ISO)
10993 
testing documented that it causes no adverse immune or inflammatory  reactions, is 
accepted b y the organism ,and does not affect an y biological healing processes.
In this stud y, CEL STAT will be compared to Surgicel Original (marketed as Tabotamp in 
some European countries [see Section 9.8.1.2] , referred to as Surgicel for the remainder 
of this document), a commerciall y available hemostatic agent based on oxidized 
regenerated cellulose, manufactured b y Johnson and Johnson's Ethicon subsidiary . For 
study  purposes the investigational devices will be traced b y means of lot numbers.
7.2Clinical Condition/Indication
Absorbable hemostats like CEL STAT or Surgicel are used in situations where ligature or 
conventional procedures are either ineffective or impractical. The devices play an 
important role in controlling bleeding during surgery  and in minimizing rebleeding in the 
postoperative period, and can have a significant impact on surgical outcomes and 
postoperative complications. 
Both CEL STAT and Surgicel are suitable for use in general and digestive surgery , plastic 
surgery , vascular and thoracic surgery , gynecology , stomatology ,and other related fi elds.
In this stud y, CEL STAT will be compared to Surgicel as hemostatic adjunct during open 
field cardiothoracic , general and vascular surgery . Target bleeding sites (TBSs) include 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 15of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
mild to moderate parenchy mal (organ tissue), vascular (small arteries or veins or surgical 
reconnections) and soft tissue (muscle, fat, ligament, connective tissue) bleeding. 
Examples of cardiothoracic , general and vascular surgery  and the associated possible 
tissue ty pes are provided in Table 1 (however, this list is not exclusive) . Excluded from 
this study  are neurological, ophthalmological, urological, and gy necologic al surgery  
(except in postmenopausal women or for gy necological surgery  that results in removal of 
childbearing potential).

7.3 Justification for the Design of the Clinical Investigation
The design of this clinical investigation is based on the experience from a previous 
clinical study with CEL STAT ,clinical studies with other absorbable hemostatic devices, 
and on preclinical study  results with CELSTAT .
Surgicel was chosen as comparator, as it is considered standard among comparable 
marketed devices. CEL STAT or Surgicel will only  be applied after primary /conventional 
hemostatic procedures ( eg, ligature, suture, compression, cautery ) prove to be either 
ineffective or impractica l. Treatment of Grade 3 or 4 ( severe or life -threatening ; see 
Table 2) bleeding is prohibited and subjects with such a bleeding at the TBS will be 
excluded from this study .
According to the anticipated clinical use, this study  intends to demonstrate the hemostatic 
effectiveness and safet y of CEL STAT in a broad range of open surgical procedures 
including cardiothoracic, 
general and vascular surgeries.
7.3.1 CELSTAT Preclinical Studies
Nonclinical data were obtained in 22 nonclinical studies investigating the safet y and 
efficacy  of CELSTAT. In 2 studies on swelling properties and the effects on pH of 
CEL STAT when exposed to neutral buffered media, the swelling and chemical prope rties 
of CEL STAT were similar to those of Surgicel OriginaI. In 14 biocompatibility  and 
toxicology  studies, no potential for CEL STAT to cause sensitization, irritation, toxicity , 
or sy stemic coagulation activation was detected; CEL STAT was determined to be
biocompatible; and no toxicologic risk resulting from exposure to extractable materials 
identified in CEL STAT was found.
Effectiveness of CELSTAT was assessed in 6 nonclinical studies. Three of these studies 
examined the time to hemostasis after CEL STAT a pplication in comparison to 
commerciall y available hemostatic products (BloodSTOP or Surgicel Original). These 
studies used either a porcine liver square model or a porcine gastrointestinal punch 
biopsy  model. In all 3 studies, CEL STAT showed a statistical ly significantly  shorter time 
to hemostasis than the comparator products. CELSTAT was also more successful than 
BloodSTOP in controlling and maintaining hemostasis over time. One study  examined 
hemostatic success (bleeding, yes or no) following application of CEL STAT or Surgicel 
Original in a rabbit femoral vein bleeding model. Statistical superiority  of CEL STAT to 
Surgicel Original was demonstrated at 30, 60, and 90 seconds after application. Another 
study  compared the hemosty ptic properties of CELSTAT and Surgicel Original in a pig 
split skin hemostasis model. Bleeding scores were statistically  significantly  reduced with 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 17of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
CEL STAT compared to Surgicel. An additional study  on hemostatic effectiveness, local 
tissue response and absorption of CEL STAT versus Sur gicel in a rabbit femoral vessel 
bleeding model showed comparability  of the 2 devices in effectiveness, local tissue 
response and absorption.
These studies are summarized in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) for CELSTAT.
7.3.2 Prior CELSTAT Clinical Investigation
The sponsor conducted a pilot clinic al study  (Study 621101) to evaluate the safet y and 
effectiveness of CELSTAT (brand name Traumastem in the study  report) as an adjunct to 
hemostasis for tissue bleeding in subjects undergoing open cardiac, intraabdominal
(including retroperitoneal) or pelvic surgery  as compared to Surgicel. This was a 
prospective, randomized, positive -controlled, subject -blinded, multicenter study .
In eligible subjects, the study  treatment was applied at the TBS after conventional 
surgica l hemostasis was completed. The number and size of lay ers of device used was at 
the discretion of the surgeon. The investigational device did not need to be removed and 
could be left in situ. 
All 82 subjects enrolled achieved hemostasis at the primary  TBS within 10 minutes. At 
5minutes after the start of device application hemostasis was achieved in 51of 
55subjects (93%) in the CEL STAT group and in 24 of 27 subjects ( 89%) in the Surgicel 
group. Median time to hemostasis ( TTH )in the CEL STAT group was 11 7 seconds, 
compared with 158 seconds in the Surgicel group.
The proportion of subjects with any adverse event ( AE)/adverse device effect ( ADE )was
similar for the CEL STAT and Surgicel groups, with 74.5% (41/55 subjects) and 74.1% 
(20/27 subjects), respecti vely. Onl y 3AEs/ADEs (postprocedural hematoma, 
postprocedural complication, and liver abscess) in the Surgicel group, all occurring in 
1subject, were considered by  the investigator to be related to study  treatment. 
The pilot study  defined AEs/ADEs of special interest as an y of the following:
Postoperative rebleeding
Infection: signs included fever >100°F or >37.8°C after the first 48 hours with 
malaise and or lethargy
Hematoma at the surgical site

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 18of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
Change in coagulation parameters (as noted b y change fr om normal or abnormal 
without clinical significance, respectively, at baseline to abnormal or abnormal 
with clinical significance at Day  7 (±1)/Discharge (Visit 3): prothrombin time, 
activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count
Increased wound hea ling time (more than 2 weeks) or wound dehiscence
Foreign bod y reactions and allergic reactions (to device and material); signs of 
inflammation or encapsulation
Embolization (especially  vascular surgeries) and associated complications
The Surgicel group ha d a higher proportion of treatment -emergent AEs/ADEs of special 
interest (22.2%, 6/27 subjects, 6 events), compared with the CEL STAT group (7.3%, 
4/55 subjects, 4events). In the Surgicel group, the 6 events of special interest were 
wound infections ( 2events), postprocedural hematoma (2 events), postprocedural 
hemorrhage, and wound dehiscence; in the CEL STAT group, the 4 events of special 
interest were abdominal abscess, wound infections, postprocedural hemorrhage, and 
wound dehiscence.
The proportions of SAEs/SADEs were similar between treatment groups, with 12.7% of 
subjects in the CEL STAT group reporting SAEs/SADEs and 11.1% of subjects in the 
Surgicel group reporting SAEs/ SADEs. The Surgicel group had 1 SAE/SADE (liver 
abscess, moderate intensity ) consi dered b y the investigator to be related to study 
treatment. No related SAEs/SADEs were reported in the CEL STAT group. In each 
group, 1 fatal AE/ADE occurred, neither of which was related to study  treatment. 
The results of the pilot study  demonstrated the safety  and effectiveness of CEL STAT as a 
treatment option to achieve hemostasis in subjects undergoing intraabdominal, pelvic, or 
open cardiac surgery . The present study  (3584 -001) will test CEL STAT versus Surgicel 
in a larger population of 258subjects sc heduled for cardiothoracic, general and vascular 
surgery .
7.3.3 Choice of Surgicel as Comparator
Surgicel was chosen as comparator, as it is the standard among comparable marketed 
devices . Surgicel has been an approved medical device since 1960 (N12159, approval
date 14 Oct 1960) in the United States. I t has a long history  of safet y and effectiveness . 
The study device will only  be used after primary  surgical hemostasis has been achieved. 
Only  bleeding sites appropriate for use of an OC device will be chosen. Ther efore, no 
additional comparators are necessary .

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 19of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
7.3.4 Types of S urgery
Feasibility  data show that OC/Surgicel is frequently  used during general, vascular, 
gynecological, and oncological surgeries. A pilot clinical study of CELSTAT 
(Study 621101) , conducted to provide sound relevant experience for planning the current 
study , supported cardiothoracic and general surgery . Therefore, general and vascular 
surgeries were chosen for this protocol. Excluded from this study  are neurological, 
ophthalmological, urological, and gy necological surgery  (except for gy necological 
surgery  in postmenopausal women or surgery  that results in removal of childbearing 
potential).
Minimally  invasive surgery ,as a distinct technique within each of the surgery t ypes 
featured in this proto col,will not be allowed due to a potential significant bias resulting 
from, among others, differences in subject profile, technical demands, pre -and 
postoperative conduct, level of trauma and hemostasis achievement compared to the open 
surgery .
7.3.5 Primary E ffectiveness E ndpoint
TTH is the most meaningful criterion to assess the effectiveness of a hemostatic device. 
Timepoints were selected based on adequacy  of demonstrating effectiveness of 
CEL STAT . In 3 nonclinical studies (Studies 53075, 52483, and 54201, summarized in 
the CEL STAT IB), the TTH after CELSTAT application was compared to commerciall y 
available hemostatic strip products (BloodSTOP or Surgicel Original); in all 3 studies, 
CEL STAT showed a statistically  signific antly shorter TTH than the comparator products. 
Other clinical studies use TTH between 3 minutes and 10minutesafter application of the 
device. A TTH of 5 minutes, which is suppo rted by  the pilot study , is a good compromise 
and applicable for all surgery  types.
7.3.6 Statistical C onsiderations
Subgroup analyses in the pilot study  showed that the surgery  type seems to have high 
potential to influence the effectiveness results. Randomization will be stratified by  
surgery  type in this study to control this effect. The sample size estimation is based on the 
assumption that the proportion of achieved hemostasis for the primary  endpoint is % 
for CEL STAT and % for Surgicel .
The non- inferiority  margin is defined as 10%. While the pilot study  identified different 
rates of hemostasis at 5 minutes across surgery  type s, and surgery  type had a high 
potential to influence effectiveness, a non -inferiority  margin of 10% is still regarded as 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 20of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
appropriate, as the small- scaled pilot study  may  not provide adequate information 
allow ing for a consistent judgement.
7.3.7 Relevant Literature and Data
Absorbable hemostatic adjuncts based on OCwere first introduced into the market in the 
1940s2,3and devices based on oxidized regenerated cellulose were launched in 1960 .4OC
offers superior handling characteristics when compared with gelatin foams. The knitted 
tissue strips can be cut to fit any  size. The device does not stick to instruments and can 
easily  be held firml y against the bleeding tissue until hemostasis is achieved.5The device 
forms a lattice -like structure that traps platelets and contribute s to clot formation by  
expanding and absorbing up to several times its own weight.6Although the 
time to 
absorption of OC is thought to range from 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the amount used,7
there are reports describing histologic evidence of OCfibers several years after cardiac 
surgery .8,9,10
Complications like allergic reactions, infections, granulomas and interference with bone 
healing have been noticed only  rarel y after the application of topical hemostatics .11
Complications with the use of OCdevices may  arise from local swelling or possible 
inflammatory  reactions.12Swelling of Surgicel in the proximity  of the spinal cord or optic 
nerve has been linked to paral ysis or nerve damage13,14and it is therefore recommended 
to remove Surgicel after use in confined areas. Additionally , foreign bod y reactions have 
been reported after the use of OCdevices.15
7.4Anticipated Benefits and Risks of the Investigational Device and Clinical 
Investigation
Benefits
The use of CELSTAT as an adjunct to hemostasis offers the following benefits:
CEL STAT is intended to serve as an adjunct ivetreatment to hemostasis similar to 
other OC devices. It offers a wide application range within the surgical area with 
currentl y onl y brisk (major) arterial bleeding as contraind ication
CEL STAT is a biodegradable material that can be left in situ, if used in 
accordance with instructions and general site practice, thus reducing the risk of 
recurrent bleeding, traumatization of the subject and di sruption of the healing 
process

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 21of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
Based on former and current animal data, CEL STAT is expected to be well
tolerated. To date, no undesirable effects such as allergic reactions at the 
application site have been reported for CEL STAT
CEL STAT is eas y to use and requires no specific preparations before application. 
Based on its ease of use, effective hemostasis, and comparabl y low costs, 
CEL STAT may reduce the overall costs for therapy
Risks
Potential risks associated with the use of either CELSTAT or Surgicel include the 
following :
Foreign bod y reaction
Inflammatory  reaction (including adhesive disease)
Infection
Rebleeding at the treated site (with or without removal of the device after 
acheivement of hemostasis
Hematoma /seroma
Thromboembolic hazards (blood clots)
Compression-related problems (eg, stenosis, nerve damage ,or sequelae related to 
decreased blood flow )
The study  inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 10), and the stud y-specified 
device application procedures (see Section 9.8.1.3 ), hav e been developed to minimize the 
magnitude of these risks, while still allowing the study objectives to be met.
Conclusions
Considering that it is not planned to include surgery  types with the highest of the 
associated risks and that the study  device application procedures are des igned to further 
mitigate the serisks , and the previousl y noted potential benefits, the study  is considered to 
be medicall y justifi ed.

9.5Factors Influencing the Outcome
Surgery  type (cardiothoracic, general and vascular) and bleeding severit y (mild, 
moderate) may  potentially  influence hemostatic effectiveness. Therefore, these factors 
will be considered in the anal ysis.
9.6Randomization and Blinding
9.6.1 Randomization
Subjects will be randomly assigned to CELSTAT or Surgicel at a ratio of 1:1.
Randomization will be stratified b y study center and surgery  types (cardiothoracic , 
general , vascular surgery) . It is aimed to achieve a similar distribution of the 3 surgery  
types in the randomized study  population. This will be controlled via aninteractive Web -
response s ystem (IWRS) ,  
USA) , using d ynamic allocation .Within , a capping strategy  will be 
used to ensure equal allocation of randomized subjects across surgical t ypes. On the day  
of surgery , upon confirmation of preoperative eligibility  criteria, a member of the sit e 
study  staff other than the surgeon will obtain a treatment assignment (CELSTAT or
Surgicel) from the IWRS. To keep the surgeon blinded until an eligible TBS has been 
identified for stud y treatment , adequate amounts of each study  product (CEL STAT and 
Surgicel) will be taken into the operating room for potential use of one of them as the 
study  treatment .
Immediately  after the subject’s intraoperative eligibility  for study  treatment has been 
confirmed (ie, an eligible TBS with Grade 1 or 2 bleeding has been identified) , the 
assigned treatment will be revealed to the surgeon and the assigned device will be applied
to the TBS . Following surgery , the treatment assignment and the actual treatment applied 
will be entered in the electronic case re port form (eCRF) for the subject.
If the subject’s eligibility is not confirmed pre-or intraoperativel y, the subject’s operation 
will be performed according to hospital standards. The study  site designee will enter the 
date and reason(s) for the subject’s exclusion in the eCRF .
9.6.2 Blinding
This will be a single -blinded study . The subjects undergoing scheduled surgery  will be 
blinded. In addition, the surgeon performing the surger y will remain blinded until an 
eligible T BS has been identified for stud y treatment (see Section 9.6.1 ).Otherwise, 
investigators, surgery  personnel, site study  personnel, CRO personnel an d sponsor 
personnel will not be blinded.

9.7Suspension or Premature Termination of the Clinical Investigation 
This study  will be terminated if 1 or more of the following criteria are met:
The incidence of device -related AEs/ADEs signals a potential health hazard
New scientific data on the investigational device do not justify  a con tinuation of 
the clinical study
Serious or persistent non -adherence to the protocol, GCP ,and/or applicable 
regulatory  requirements by  an investigator site may lead to a stop of recruitment 
andclosure at this specific site
The study  is stoppe d by the sponsor for any  reason
The clinical investigation may  be terminated at an individual study  site if no subjects are 
recruited within 6months after site initiation, as well as in case of GCP non- compliance .
Subject follow -up after premature termination of the clinical investigation will include all 
procedures scheduled for the post-operation follow -upvisits on Day 8 (±1)/discharge, 
Day 31 (5),Day 61 (10), and Day 91 (10)/E nd of Study (Supplement 21.2).
9.8Investigational Device(s) and Comparator(s)
9.8.1 Description and Administration of Treatment
9.8.1.1 Description of the Investigational Device -CELSTAT
CEL STAT is a medical device intended for use adjunctively  in surgical procedures to 
assist in the control of capillary , venous and small arterial hemorrhage when ligation or 
other conventional methods of control are impractical or ineffe ctive . It is a gamma -
sterilized absorbable hemostat in a flat (matrix/ OC) form based on OC. It has a textile 
structure and the raw material for manufacturing of CEL STAT is natural cotton. The 
cotton is oxidized in the gaseo us phase b y nitrogen dioxide. This reaction results 
primarily  in the conversion of hy droxy l groups to carboxy lic acid groups, making the 
material soluble at ph ysiological conditions. Cellulosic acid within the device causes 
localized denaturation of blood proteins. The device does not contain substances derived 
from natural rubber latex ,and is both poly vinyl chloride -free and diethy lhexy l phthalate -
free.
The manufacturer and supplier of CEL STAT is  
, Czech Republic. The manufacturer takes all necessary  measures to ensure that 
the investigational device corresponds to the manufacturing and sterilization 
documentation.

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 27of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
CEL STAT is provided sterilized (gamma irradiated), endotoxin -free with the following 
physical properti es:
Composition: OC(100%)
Weight: 90 to 120 g/m2
Nitrogen content: ≤0.5%
Quantity  of carbox yl groups: 16% - 24%
Loss on dry ing: ≤15%
For this study , CELSTAT sheets with the dimension 5×7.5 cm will be provided. Each 
sheet will be packed in a sterile pouch. Tensterile pouches ( each containing 1CEL STAT
sheet ) will be included in each boxof CEL STAT .
CEL STAT should be stored in a dry  area protected from light between 2ºC and 30ºC. 
CEL STAT ’s shelf -lifeis 3years after sterilization in original packaging.
9.8.1.2 Description of Comparator Device – Surgicel
Surgicel  is a commercially  available hemostatic device manufactured by  Johnson and 
Johnson's Ethicon subsidiary. Surgicel is an absorbable knitted fabric prepared b y the 
controlled oxidation of regene rated cellulos e (pol yanhydroglucuronic acid).
Surgicel is used adjunctively  in a variet y of surgical procedures to assist in the control of 
capillary , venous, and small arterial bleeding when conventional methods of control are 
impractical or ineffective.
Surgicel is white with a pale yellow cast and has a faint, caramel -like aroma. I t is strong 
and can be sutured or cut without fray ing. After Surgicel has been saturated with blood, it 
swells into a brownish or black gelatinous mass.
For this study , Surgice l Original will be supplied to the investigator sites in the 
configuration as prepared for final use b y the manufacturer: knitted fabric sheets of 
5.1×7.6 cmSurgicel Original (for United States investigator sites ) or5.0×7.5 cm
Tabotamp (for European inve stigator sites) . Each sheet will be packed in a sterile pouch
containing an inner sterile envelop ethathouses the sheet . Twelve or 24 sheets and 
1Instructions for Use insert will be included in each box of the product .
Surgicel should be stored at controlled room temperature (Surgicel at 15° to 30°C /
Tabotamp at 15° to 25° C). Surgicel’s shelf life is 3 years.

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 28of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
9.8.1.3 Administration of the Study Device
In case more than 1 bleeding site is identified after conventional hemostasis, the first site 
appearing adequate according to the study  eligibility  criteria will be considered the TBS 
for hemostatic effectiveness and safety  assessments. Additional bleeding sites are to be 
treated according to the hospital’s standard of care, but not using either the CEL STAT or 
Surgicel that was supplied for study  use, or any  CEL STAT or Surgicel product otherwise 
available at the site. These bleeding sites will not be assessed for efficacy  as part of the 
study .
Sterile technique should be observed in removing the study  device from its sterile 
container. Once re moved, the device is applied directly  to the dried TBS. The nuber and 
size of lay ers required depends on the nature and intensity  of the bleeding to be stopped. 
No upper limit is stipulated. The surgeon may obtain different sheet sizes by cutting the 
provided sheets with dry  scissors. Only  as much (length/width/ numbers of lay ers) 
CEL STAT or Surgicel is to be used as is necessary to achieve hemostasis. The study  
device should not be wrapped too tightly  when used as a wrap during vascular surgery .
The device is to be laid on the TBS and held firmly  in place against the TBS for at least 
30seconds. The way  the product is held in place is at the discretion of the surgeon 
depending on the nature of the TBS and should be si milar for both products. The device 
should not be used for packing or wadding, unless it is to be removed after he mostasis is 
achieved.
The achievement or lack of hemostasis following treatment application to the TBS will 
be recorded at different time points during the first 10 minutes after the start of device 
application, as described in Section 12.2.If hemostasis appears to be achieved earl y, but 
rebleeding occurs during the 10 -minute assessment period, more of the randomized 
product may  be applied and the hemostasis assessment will continue.
During the 10 -minute observation period all efforts should be made to achieve hemostasis
at the TBS onl y by using the randomized study treatment.
Prior to surgical closure , any  parts of the device not soaked with blood are to be carefull y 
cut off to promote absorption and minimize the possibility  of foreign bod y reaction .
Both CEL STAT and Surgicel are considered absorbable hemostats (based on preclinical 
data, a bsorption of CELSTAT is e xpected to take no more than 30 days). For study  safet y 
assesm ent purposes, both devices should be left in situ after hemostasis has been 
achieved , unless the investigator believes that the subject’s safet y would be jeopardized,

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 29of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
or if the product is ineffective. However, no more than 5 CELSTAT sheets or 
14 Surgicel sheets are to remain in situ at surgical closure in a given subject (see 
Section 9.8.2 ).If some or all of the applied sheets are removed, the remov al of the 
device(s) must be recorded on the eCRF, along with the rationale for removal .
Any rebleeding from the TBS after the 10 -minute assessment period following treatment 
application is to be recorded as an AE, and is to be treated according to standard of care
as determined by the surgeon. Should the investigator think that only  OC is indicated, the 
randomized study  device should be used if possible . However, no more than 
5CELSTAT sheets or 14 Surgicel sheets are to remain in situ at surgical closure i n a 
given subject.
9.8.2 Number of Investigational Devices and Justification
Nomore than 5CELSTAT sheets are to remain in situ at surgical closure in a given 
subject . The results of a toxicological evaluation of CEL STAT demonstrated that no risk 
of adverse effects caused by  extractable substances is anticipated when up to 5 of the 
5.0 x 7.5 cm sheets are applied per adult patient (ie, approximately  1sheet per 14 kg 
[31lb] body  weight). This corresponds to an amount of 43 mg of CELSTAT per kg bod y 
weight (eg, 5sheets for a 70 kg [154 lb] adult).
In order to allow an adequate safety  comparison between the test and control products, no 
more than 14 Surgicel sheets are to remain in situ at surgical closure in a given 
subject. This provides an approximately  equivalent maximum mass of Surgicel , which 
has a lower density  than CEL STAT ,that can be allowed to be left in situ.
9.8.3 Justification for Use of Comparator(s)
Surgicel was chosen as active comparator, as it is considered standard among compa rable 
marketed devices .
9.9Investigational Device Accountability
The investigator will ensure that the investigational device and the comparator are stored 
as specified in the CIP and that the storage area is secured, with access limited to 
authorized study  personnel, as described in the Clinical Study  Agreement. A temperature 
log will be completed on a daily  basis, in order to ensure maintenance of the correct 
storage temperature. In addition, the investigator will maintain records that the 
investigational de vice and comparator were received, including the date received, device 
identity  code, date of manufacture or expiration date, number of devices received and 
their disposition. The investigational device and comparator must be dispensed only  at 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 30of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
the study  site. Records will be maintained that include the subject identification code 
(SIC) (see Section 11.2), application date, and number of devices used. All unused boxes 
and pouches of investigational device will be disposed of in accordance with the 
sponsor ’s instructions and all applicable laws and regulations after study

10.3 Criteria and Procedures for Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation
Any subject may  voluntarily  withdraw (ie, reduce the degree of participation in the study ) 
consent for continued participation and data collection. The reason for withdra wal will be 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 33of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
recorded on the end-of-s tudy eCRF. The data collected on withdrawn subjects will be 
used in the anal ysis and included in the clinical investigation repor t.
Discontinuation (ie, complete withdrawal from study  participation) may  be due to 
dropout (ie, active discontinuation by subject) or loss to follow -up (ie, discontinuation by  
subject without notice or action). Additionally , the investigator and the sponsor have the 
discretion to discontinue any  subject from the study  if, in their judgment, continued 
participation would pose an unacceptable risk for the subject.
For subjects who terminate the clinical investigation prematurel y after treatment 
exposure, a f inal examination including all Day  8 (±1 )/discharge ,Day 31 (±5), orDay 61
(10)/end -of-s tudy follow -up assessments, depending on the time of withdrawal, should 
be performed, if possible. If a subject cannot come to a final examination, the investigator 
should try  to clarify  the reason and timepoint for discontinuation/drop out and document 
this in the source document used at the site. In case of drop out due to an 
SAE/SADE/UADE/AE of special interest, the event has to be documented sufficiently  in 
the SAER form and the investigator has to report the SAE/SADE/UADE/AE of special 
interest to the CRO within 24 h ours (see Section 12.3.2.4 ).
11. P ROCEDURES
11.1 Informed Consent and Enrollment
Any subject who provides informed consent (ie, signs and dates the ICF,see Section 
16.3) is considered enrolled in the study .Any subject who meets the inclu sion criteria 
(including the intraoperative inclusion criterion) and does not fulfill the exclusion criteria 
is considered eligible for randomization. Screening failures are subjects who provide 
informed consent, but do not meet the eligibility criteria for treatment .
11.2 Subject Identification Code
The following series of numbers will comprise the SIC: 3584 -001-SSS-EEEE
3584 -001:CIP identifier
SSS: 3-digit study  site number
EEEE: 4-digit enrolment number, reflecting the order of signing the ICF
For example, the third subject who sign san ICFat study  site 02 will be identified as 
Subject 3584 -001-002-0003.
All subject -related study  documents (eg, eCRFs, clinical documentation, sample 
containers, device accountability  logs) will be identified with the SI C. 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 34of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
11.3 Screening and Study Visits
All screening data will be collected and reported in eCRF s, regardless of screening 
outcome. In case a subject provided informed consent, was assig ned an SIC, was 
screened and is eligible, but the operation c ould not be performed within 14 days, the 
End-of-S tudy eCRF willbe completed indicating that the subject was not randomized and 
treated . In such a case ,re-screening is allowed. If thesubject is re -screened ,a new ICF,
new SIC,and new eCRF are required for th esubject. The e CRF for the original SI C will 
be retained .
The study  flow chart is illustrated inSupplement 21.1.An overview on the procedures to 
be performed at each study  visit, including screening, can be found in Supplement 21.2.
11.4 Medications and Non -Drug Therapies
Thefollowing medications may be discontinued prior to the surgery  according to the 
local standard of care :
Anti- platelet agents
Anti- coagulant therap y (oral or intravenous) and thrombolytic agents
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs
Selective serotonin re -uptake inhibitors (SSRI s) may  increase the risk of bleeding 
events .16Discontinuing an SSRI  prior to the scheduled surgery  should, therefore ,be 
considered.
However, if antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therap y cannot be discontinued prior to 
surgery  due to medical reasons, these drugs must be documented asconcomitant 
medication.
Homeopathic medications should generall y be avoided because of the lack of information 
on safet y and efficacy or possible effects on coagulation .
11.5 Subject Completion/Discontinuation
A subject is considered to have completed the study  when he/she ceases active 
participation in the study  because the subject has completed all study  visits in accordance
with the CIP(with or without deviat ions).
Reasons for discontinuation will be reported on the end-of-s tudy eCRF , including: screen 
failure, completion, premature discontinuation, and, if applicable, the reason for 
premature discontinuation ( AE, discontinuation by  subject [eg, lost to follow -up, defined 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 35of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
as 3documented unsuccessful attempts to contact the subject , or dropout), phy sician 
decision, study  terminated by  sponsor, or other reason [to be specified by the 
investigator ]). Regardless of the reason, all data available for the subject up to the time of 
discontinuation willbe recorded on the appropriate eCRF and will be used in the anal ysis 
and included in the clinical study  report. Refer to Section 10.3 for reasons for premature 
discontinuation or withdrawal.
Every  effort will be made to have prematurel y discontinu ingsubjects complete the 
procedures/assessments scheduled for the end -of-study visit (Visit 6 ). Theassessment 
results shall be recorded on the end-of- study  (Visit 6) eCRF, and not as an u nscheduled 
visit. I f a subject prematurely  terminates participation in the study  during or immediately  
after a scheduled visit and does not return for an additional premature termination visit , 
thedata from their last scheduled visit will remain as recorded (ie, no data from that visit 
willbe repeated on or transferred to the Visit 6eCRF ).
In the event of subject discontinuation due to an AE /ADE, clinical and/or labo ratory  
investigations that are beyond the scope of the required study observations/assessments 
may be performed as part of the evaluation of the event. These investigations will take 
place under the direction of the investigator in consultation with the CR O, and the details 
of the outcome may  be reported to the appropriate regulatory  authorities b y the CRO .
11.6 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance
All study  procedures are to be performed under the direct supervision of the 
investigator/a licensed health care professional at the study site, and thus, no separate 
procedures are needed to monitor subject compliance.
12. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOM ES
12.1 Medical , Medication and Non -Drug Therapy History
At screening, the subject’s medical history  (including surgery ; disease or condition 
severit y [mild, moderate, or severe as defined in Section 12.3.2.2 ];and start and end 
dates ) will be described for the following bod ysystems, if known: ey es, ears, nose, and 
throat; respiratory ; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal; musculoskeletal; neurological; 
endocrine; hematopoietic/ly mphatic; dermatological; and genitourinary .Subject 
demographics will also be entered in the eCRF.
All medications taken and non-drug therapies received from enrollment through the end 
of study  participation will be recorded on the concomitant medications and non- drug 
therapies eCRFs.

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 36of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
For the purpose of this study , standard routine perioperative medicatio n/treatment and 
anesthesia in relation to the surgical intervention ( except anticoagulation and reversal) do 
not have to be recorded as concomitant medication.
12.2 Assessment of Effectiveness
For statistical anal ysis, the observation period includes the 10 minutes after start of
application of the stud y device to the TBS .
The surgeon (who will be trained on the Bleeding Severity  Scale [see Table 2] prior to 
study  partici pation) will perform all intraoperative hemostasis assessments of the TBS, 
including identify ing the TBS.
The severity of bleeding (Grade 1 or 2; see Table 2) at the TBS at the time of its 
identification (and prior to start of study  device application) will be recorded.
A stop watch will be started at the start of device application. After application ,the 
device is to be held firmly in place for at least 30 sec onds. The occurrence and time of 
occurrence ( or absence )of hemostasis (ie, Grade 0 bleeding; see Table 2)at the TBS will 
be recorded after the start of device application. Recurrence of bleeding, time of 
recurrence, and subsequent time of hemostasis will also be recorded, if applicable.
If hemostasis appears to be achieved earl y, but rebleeding occurs during the 10 -minute 
assessment period, more of the randomized product may  be applied and the hemostasis 
assessment will continue. TTH is defined as the time from the start of application of the 
study  device until the first timepoint at which hemostasis at the TBS was o bserved and 
after which no rebleeding from the TBS occurred during the 10 -minute observation 
period (subsequent intraoperative rebleeding will be considered a treatment failure).
In addition, any  intraoperative rebleeding from the TBS after the initial 10 -minute 
assessment period and prior to surgical closure will be recorded.

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 37of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
Treatment failure is defined as an y of the following:
Hemostasis not being achieved within 10 minutes
Occurrence of bleeding complications during the 10- minute hemostasis 
assessment period requiring hemostatic measures other than application of the 
randomized study  treatment
Intraoperative rebleeding after the 10 -minute hemostasis assessment period that is 
treated with the randomized study  treatment or with any  other hemostatic 
measure s
The responsible stud y personnel will also record the following surgical, TBS, device 
administration, and hemostasis/rebleeding information during the peri -and intra operative 
periods:
Date of surgery
Time of start and end of surgery  (first skin incision/last skin suture)
Surgery  type (cardiothoracic , general, vascular)
Indication for surgery  and surgical procedure performed
Anatomical location of TBS
Tissue type (soft tissue, parench ymal or vascular )
Type of conventional hemostatic measures at the TBS before randomization
Time of completion of conventional hemostatic methods at TBS
Identity  (CELSTAT or Surgicel) and lot number of the applied study  product
Number of sheets of the study  product applied to the TBS
Number of sheets of the study  product left in situ at surgical closure
Reason, if study  product removed prior to surgical closure
Use of additional hemostatic treatment (y es/no) other than the study  product at the 
TBS (ie, if hemostasis was not obtained during the 10 -minute observation period, 
or if hemostasis was achieved but intraoperative rebleeding occurred); time of use 
(ie, number of minutes after clock start or after the 10 min uteobservation period), 
and ty pe of additional hemostatic trea tment

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 38of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
Use of a nticoagulation and reversal during surgery , including:
Whether an y anticoagulation was used (y es/no)
Anticoagulant used, start and end times of administration and dose 
administered for each dose administered
Reversal agent used (if any ), star t and end times of administration and dose 
administered for each dose administered
Whether cardiopulmonary b ypass was used (y es/no)and, if yes, start and end 
times of by pass
Timepoint(s) of intraoperative rebleeding, if an y, at the TBS after the 10 -minute
observation period (to also be documented as an AE[see Section 12.3.2.4 ])
Intraoperative complications including death (to be documented as AEs)
12.3 Assessment of Safety
12.3.1 Postoperative Rebleeding
The occurrence of an y postoperative rebleeding from the TBS requiring surgical
re-exploration during the remainder of the subject’s participation in the study  will be 
recorded in the eCRF and will also be documented as an AE.
12.3.2 Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Device Deficiencies
12.3.2.1 Definition s
12.3.2.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE (also refers to adverse experience) is defined as any  untoward medical 
occurrence, unintended disease or injury , or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal 
laboratory  findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device. This defini tion includes events related to the 
investigational medical device or the comparator , as well as events related to the 
procedures involved. However, for users or other persons, this definition is restricted to 
events related to investigational medical devi ces.
AEs occurring after application of the study  device are to be specified as treatment-
emergent AEs .
Certain e vents that do not necessaril y meet the definition of AEs, regardless of causal 
association with the investigational device(s), will still be recorded because they  may  be 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 39of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
reportable to r egulatory  authorities according to AE reporting regulati ons. These include 
the following:
Exposure to a device during pregnancy
Inadvertent or accidental exposure
Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from the medical device
Application errors (ie, incorrect use of product)
12.3.2.1.2 Serious Adverse Event/ Serious Injury 
AnSAE /SIis an AE that :
Leads to death
Leads to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either results in:
Alife-threatening illnes s or injury  (NOTE: “Life -threatening” in the definition 
of “serious” refers to an AE in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event or reaction; it does not refer to an event or reaction which 
hypothetically  might have caused death had it been more severe), or
Apermanent impairment of a bod y structure or a body function, or
In-patient or prolonged hospitalization (NOTE: Planned hospitalization for a 
pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by  the CI P without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE), or
Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or injury  or 
permanent impairment to a body  structure or a body  function
Leads to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality  or birt h defect
Is a medicall y important event that may  not be immediately  life-threatening or 
require hospitalization but may  jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions 
above. Examples of such events are:
Rebleeding requiring surgical revision
Wound infection requiring surgical re -exploration

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 40of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in
hospitalization
12.3.2.1.3 Nons erious Adverse Event
A nonserious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE.
12.3.2.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, severity, specificit y, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representati on, or description used in the reference s afety 
information (eg, IB, Instructions for Use ).“Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are 
mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of devices or as anticipated from the 
properties of the device, but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the 
particular device under investigation.
For the purposes of this investigation, each unexpected AE experienced b y a subject 
treated with the stud y device will be recorded on the AE eCRF .
12.3.2.1.5 Adverse Device Effect
AnADE is an AE related to the use of an investigational medical device. ADEs include 
AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deploy ment, 
implantation, installation, or operation, or an y malfunction of the investigational medical 
device. ADEs also include an y event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.
12.3.2.1.6 Serious Adverse Device Effect
A SADE is an ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of an 
SAE.
12.3.2.1.7 Unanticipat ed(Unexpected) Serious Adverse Device Effect
An unanticipated SADE is anySADE on health or safet y or an y life -threatening problem 
or death caused b y, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem or death was not 
previously  identified in nature, severity , or degree of incidence in the investigational 
plan/application/instruction sfor use, or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safet y,or welfare of subjects. 
An a nticipated serious ADE is an effect which b y its nature, incidence, severity ,or 
outcome has been identified in the IB, risk anal ysis report, or Instructions for Use.

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 41of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
In case an ADE or AE has been reported with other products of the same class but not 
with the investigational device, this ADE or AE shall be considered unanticipated/
unexpected for the investigational device.
12.3.2.1.8 Adverse Events of Special Interest
In this stud y, AEs of special interest are defined as any of the following events (Medical 
Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities [MedDRA ] preferred terms shown in parentheses):
Postoperative rebleeding (post procedural hemorrhage) from the TBS during the 
subject’s participation in the study
Signs of local inflammation, adhesions or encapsulation (p ost procedural 
inflammation, postoperative adhesion, encapsulation reaction ) at the device 
application site
Local infection (p ost procedural infection , postoperative abscess) a t the TBS 
Hematoma (p ost procedural hematoma ) at the TBS
Foreign bod y reactions (f oreign bod y reaction ), and allergic reactions 
(hypersensitivity ) to the device, both s ystemic orlocal
Thromboembolic events (p ostoperative thrombosis , deep vein thrombosis 
postoperative ), especiall y in a vascular surgery  case
AEs of special interest will be reported to the CRO’s Sa fety Department on the SAER 
form (see Section 2). However, AEs of special interest should not be considered serious 
unless they  meet SAE criteria (see Section 12.3.2.1.2 ). Nonserious AEs of special interest 
are to be reported to the authorities or committees concerned according to the procedure s 
and timelines applicable for nonserious AEs. Serious AEs of special interest are to be 
reported according to the procedures and timelines applicable for SAEs (see Section 2).
12.3.2.1.9 Device Deficiency
A device deficiency  is an inadequacy  of a medical device with respect to its identity , 
quality , durabilit y, reliability , safet y,or performance. 
All device deficiencies related to the identity , quality , durability , reliability , safety, or 
performance of an investigational medical device shall be documented on the appropriate 
forms throughout the clinical investigation (see also Section 12.3.2.10 fordocumentation 
and reporting of device deficiencies that did not lead to an AE, ie, non- medical 
complaints).

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 42of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
Device deficiencies that did not lead to an AE but might have led to a SADE if either 
suitable action had not been taken, intervention had not been made, or circum stances had 
been less fortunate , must be reported as specified in Section 2.
12.3.2.2 Severity
The investigator will assess the severit y of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and 
judgment based on the most appropriate description as follows :
Mild
The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere i n a significant manner 
with the subject’s normal functioning level
The AE resolves spontaneously  or may  require minimal therapeutic 
intervention
Moderate
The AE produces limited impairment of function and may  require therapeutic 
intervention
The AE produce s no sequel ae
Severe
The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may  lead to temporary  
inability  to resume usual life pattern
The AE produces sequel ae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic intervention
12.3.2.3 Causality
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
investigational device is etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality  
assessment includes, eg, assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge 
information, association (or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or 
absence) of a more likel y cause, and ph ysiological plausibility . For each AE assessed as 
not related or unlikel y related ,the investigator shall provide an alternative etiology . For 
each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the investigational 
device and the AE ,using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the 
following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
Not related (both circumstances must be met)

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 43of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent 
treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs
Is not associated with the investigational device (ie, does not follow a 
reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of investigational 
device or has a much more likely  alternative etiology ) 
Unlikely  related (either oneor both circumstances are met)
Has little or no temporal relationship to the investigational device 
A more likely  alternative etiology  exists
Possibly  related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the 
investigational device
An alternative etiology  is equally  or less likely  compared to the potential 
relationship to the investigational device
Probably  related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of an 
investigational device, which may  include but is not limited to the following: 
oReappearance of a similar reaction upon re -administration (p ositive 
rechallenge)
oPositive results in a sensitivity  test ( eg, skin test)
oToxic level of one or more components of the investigational device ,as 
evidenced b y measurement of concentration in the blood or other bodily  
fluid
Another etiology  is unlikely  orsignificantly  less likely
12.3.2.4 Assessment of Adverse Events
Each AE occurring after the subject sign sthe ICFuntil study  completion or premature
discontinuation from the study  (except for specified forseeable events; see 
Section 12.3.2.7 ) willbe described on the AE eCRF (ie, 1 AE per form) using the 
medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis could be established at the time of 
reporting the AE, a s ymptom or sign, in standard medical terminology  in order to avoid 
the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see definition in 
Section 12.3.2.1.1 ). Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for:
Seriousness a s defined in Section 12.3.2 .1.2
Severity  as defined in Section 12.3.2.2

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 44of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
Causal relationship to investigational device exposure as defined in 
Section 12.3.2.3
For each AE, the outcome (ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal) and action taken (ie, 
dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, device interrupt ed, device withdrawn, 
not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE eCRF. Recovering/resolving 
AEs will be followed until resolution, until medically stabilized, or for 30 days after the 
subject’s study  completion/termination visit, whichever comes first . Only outcome -
related follow -up information received after the subject’s study completion/termination 
visit will be recorded in the AE eCRF.
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE occurring in a subject after study 
completion, the SAE must be reported on the SAER form within 24 hours after becoming 
aware of the SAE (see Section 12.3.2.4 ).
AEand laboratory  safety data will be monitored by  anindepen dent DSMB on a regular 
basis. Further information on the DSMB is presented in Section 16.4.
12.3.2.5 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting
All SAEs/SADEs/UADEs occurring during the course of the stud y will be reported to the 
CRO within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.
AEs of special interest (see Section 12.3.2.1.8 )will also be captured on the SAER form 
and reported to the CRO ;however, they will only  be considered serious if they  meet the 
SAE criteria (see Section 12.3.2.1.2 ). Within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, 
the study  site will send the completed SAER fo rm to the CRO by  e-mail or fax.
As required, the CRO will report SAEs, SADEs, and UADEs to the competent 
authorities, manufacturers, central reviewing IRBs/IECs/REB s, and investiga tive sites 
according to country -specific reporting timelines. Reporting to the competent authorities 
will be performed b y the sponsor (Baxter) for CELSTAT.
Nonserious AEs of special interest are to be reported to the authorities or 
IRBs/IECs/REBs concerned according to the procedures and timelines applicable for 
nonserious AEs. Serious AEs of special interest are to be reported acc ording to the

12.3.2.6 Pre-existing Diseases
Pre-existing diseases that are present before entry  into the study  as described in the 
medical history , and that manifest with the same severit y, frequency, or duration after 
investigational device exposure , will not be recorded as AEs. However, when there is an 
increase in the severity ,duration , or frequency of a pre -existing disease, the event must 
be described on the AE eCRF .
12.3.2.7 Foreseeable Adverse Events
A foreseeable AE is defined as an AE inherent to the surgical procedure that is expected 
to occur in all subjects . Each of the following events expe rienced after device exposure 
will not be considered an AE, will notbe captured in the eCRF and thus, will not be
included in the anal ysis of AEs ( unless their severity  and/or duration exceeds the 
clinically  expected range ):
Postoperative nausea
Postoperative vomiting
Postoperative sleep disturbances
Postoperative tiredness/fatigue
Postoperative pain at the surgery  site
Back/neck/shoulder pain related to l ying on the operating table
Postoperative constipation
12.3.2.8 Urgent Safety Measures
The investigato r is to take appropriate urgent safety measures in order to protect subjects 
against any immediate hazard to their health or safety. This does not need prior 
authorization from the sponsor . In the event(s) of an apparent immediate hazard to the 
subject, th e investigator will notify  the CRO immediatel y by phone and confirm 
notification to the CRO in writing as soon as possible, but within 1 calendar day after the 
change is implemented. The CRO will also ensure the responsible ethics committee and 
competent a uthorities are notified of the urgent measures taken in such cases according to 
local regulations.
12.3.2.9 Untoward Medical Occurrences Not Considered Adverse Events
Each serious untoward medical occurrence experienced before the first investigational 
device exposure (eg, from the time of signed informed consent up to ,but not including ,
the first investigational device exposure) will be described on the SAER form and will be 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 46of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
entered into the eCRF . However, t hese events will not be considered as SAEs and will 
not be included in the analy sis of SAEs.
Each nonserious untoward medical occurrence experienced b y a subject before the first 
investigational device exposure will be recorded on the AE eCRF; these events will not 
be consi dered as AEs and will not be included in the anal ysis of AEs.
For the purposes of this study , preplanned elective procedures and hospitalizations for 
such procedures, before and after device exposure will not be considered AEs (unless the 
condition for whi ch the procedure was planned has worsened since baseline) and thus, 
not included in the anal ysis of AEs. Such preplanned procedures must be recorded at 
screening.
12.3.2.10 Non-Medical Complaints
A non- medical complaint ( NMC )is an y alleged product deficiency  that r elates to 
identity , quality , durability , reliability , safety, and performance of the product but did not 
result in an AE. NMCs include but are not limited to the following:
Device malfunctions, which are defined as failure of the device to meet its 
performance specifications or otherwise to perform as intended
Missing components
Damage to the product or unit carton
A mislabeled product ( potential counterfeiting/ tampering)
A bacteriological, chemical, or ph ysical change or deterioration of the product
causing it to malfunction or to present a hazard or fail to meet label claims
Any NMCs will be documented on a nNMC form. If an investigational device fails to 
perform in the expected manner, the CRO will be notified within one (1) business day .If 
reques ted, defective devices will be returned to the sponsor for inspection and anal ysis 
according to specified procedures.
For reporting of de vice deficiencies that did not lead to an AE,but could have led to a n
SADE, refer to Section 12.3.2.1.8 and Section 2.
12.3.3 Physical Examinations
At screening and each of the postsurgical study visits , a phy sical examination will be 
performed on the following bod y systems (being described as normal or abnormal) : 
general appearance, head and neck, ey es and ears, nose and throat, chest, lungs, heart, 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 47of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
abdomen, extremities and joints, ly mph nodes, skin, and neurological system . At 
screening, if an abnormal condition is detected, the condition will be described on the 
medical history  eCRF . At subsequent study  visits, if a new abnormality  or a worsened 
pre-existing abnormality  is detected, the condition will be reported as an AE on the AE 
eCRF. If the abnormality was not deemed an AE because it was due to a preexisting 
disease (described in Section 12.3.2.6 ), is not clinically  significant, is a s ymptom of a 
new/worsened condition alread y recorded as an AE, or due to another issue, the 
investigator will record the justification on the source record.
12.3.4 Clinical Laboratory Parameters
12.3.4.1 Hematology, Clinical Chemistry and Coagulation
The hematology  panel will consist of complete blood count [hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
erythrocy tes (ie, red blood cell count), and leukocy tes (ie, white blood cell count)] with 
differ ential (ie, basophils, eosinophils, ly mphocy tes, monocy tes, neutrophils) and platelet 
counts. 
The clinical chemistry  panel will consist of sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline p hosphatase, 
blood urea nit rogen, creatinine, and glucose.
The coagulation panel will consist of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin 
time and, where applicable, international normalized ratio.
Blood samples will be drawn for assessment of hematology  and clinical chemistry  
parameters at screening (Visit 1) and at each of the postsurg icalstudy  visits (Visits 3 
through 6). A central laboratory  will be used. Blood samples will be handled and stored 
according to the instructions provided by  thecentral laboratory . The laboratory  reports 
provided b y the central laboratory will be reviewed, signed and dated b y the investigator 
and attached to the source documents.
Screening laboratory  samples (for hematology , clinical chemistry , coagulation and se rum 
pregnancy  test) must be taken within 7days prior to surgery .
12.3.4.2 Other Laboratory Tests
A serum pregnancy  test for females of childbearing potential will be performed at 
screening to confirm that the subject is not pregnant (preoperative exclusion criteri on9; 
see Section 10.2). The serum pregnancy  test will be performed b y the central laboratory. 
An additional urine pregnancy  test will be performed preoperative ly on the day  of 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 48of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
surgery if the serum pregnancy  test was performed >7 days prior to the planned surgery . 
The urine pregnancy  test will be performed b y the investigator site.
12.3.4.3 Assessment of Laboratory Values
The investigator’s assessment of each abnormal labora tory value is to be recorded on the 
eCRF. For each abnormal laboratory  value, the investigator will determine whether the 
value is considered clinically  significant. For clinically  significant values, the investigator 
will consider whether or not to report an AE (see definition in Section 12.3.2.1.1 ). If yes, 
the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis will be recorded on the AE eCRF. If the 
abnormal value was not deemed clinicall y significant ,the investigator will indicate on the 
eCRF the reason (ie, lab error, due to pre -existing disease [described in 
Section 12.3.2.6 ]), symptom of a new/worsened condition already  recorded as an AE, or 
due to anoth er issue that will be specified ). Additional tests and other evaluations 
required to establish the significanc e or etiology  of an abnormal result, or to monitor the 
course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated. An y abnormal value that 
persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator.
Clinically  significant abnormal deviations of la boratory  parameters (ie, values suggesting 
an unknown disease and requiring further clinical evaluation) revealed at the screening 
visit are not considered to be AEs.
12.3.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs will include body temperature (°C or °F ;otic, oral or axillary  method), 
respiratory  rate (breaths/min), pulse rate (beats/min), and s ystolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (mmHg). Height (in or cm) and weight (lb or kg) will also be collected.
Vital signs will be measured at screening and at all postsurg icalstudy  follow -up visits
(height will onl y be collected at screening) .
Vital sign values are to be recorded on the eCRF. For each vital sign value recorded 
postoperative ly, the investigator will determine whether the value is considered an AE 
(see definition in Section 12.3.2.1.1 ). If assessed as an AE, the medical diagnosis 
(preferabl y), symptom, or sign, will be recorded on the AE e CRF. If the abnormal va lue 
was not deemed an AE , the investigator will indicate the reason on the source record
(ie, error, due to a pre- existing disease [ described in Section 12.3.2.6 ], not clinically  
significant, a sy mptom of a new/worsened condition already  recorded as an AE, or due to 
another issue that will be specified ). Additional tests and other evaluations required to 
establish the significance or etiology  of an abnormal result, or to monitor the course of an 

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 49of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
AE should be obtained when clinically  indicated. Any  abnormal value that persists 
should be followed at the discretion of the investigator.
13.STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
13.1 Sample Size and Power Calculations
The st udy is designed to show non -inferiorit y of CEL STAT compared to Surgicel based 
on the primary  effectiveness endpoint, ie, the proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis 
within 5 minutes of the start of application of study  treatment, which is maintained un til 
surgical closure .These proportions are assumed to be % for CELSTAT and % for 
Surgicel (based on the experience from the pilot study , Study  621101 [ see Section 7.3.2 ]
and considering some buffer in the proportions). Using a non-inferiority  margin of 10% 
(the largest clinically  acceptable difference), a 1-sided Type1 error rate () of 2.5%,and 
a statistical power (1 -) of 80%, the sample size estimation results in 121evaluable 
subjects per treatment group. The estimation of the sample size was performed using 
 ( , NC).
The primary  anal ysis will be performed on th e per-protocol anal ysis set (PPS). Assuming 
that the PPS is 5% less than the total number of randomized subjects and adjusting 
slightly  upward to allow for equal numbers of subjects of the 3 surgery  types, 
129subjects per treatment gro up have to be random ized.
13.2 Datasets and Analysis Cohorts
Two ty pes of analy ses of effectiveness are planned: analy sis of the full analy sis set (FAS) 
and of the PPS . Assessment of safet y will be carried out on all subjects treated (safet y 
analysis set).
Full anal ysis set : The FAS will consist of all subjects who are randomized. Subjects will 
be anal yzed as randomized.
Per-protocol analy sis set:The PP Sis defined as a subset of the FAS . Subjects will be 
excluded from the PPS if they:
Do not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria
Are randomized but not treated according to the randomization scheme
Violate other major study  procedures that may  influence the study  results
Safety  anal ysis set : The safet y analysis set will consist of all subjects who are treated 
with CEL STAT or Surgic el. Subjects will be analy zed as treated.

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 50of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
13.3 Handling of Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data
Only  subjects for whom data are available will be included in the statistical anal ysis. 
Missing values will be neither replaced nor estimated in the primary  anal ysis. A 
sensitivity  anal ysis, in which all missing data will be considered as treatment failures will 
be performed for the FAS to assess the influence of missing data on the primary  efficacy  
results. I n addition, a worst -case anal ysis will also be performed, in which any  subjects in 
the CEL STAT treatment group with missing primary  efficacy  data will be categorized as 
treatment failures, and any subjects in the Surgicel treatment group with missing primary 
efficacy  data will be categorized as treatment successes.
13.4 Methods of Analysis
13.4.1 Primary Outcome Measure s
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be carried out on the PPS . The analysis using the FAS
will be used as a supportive anal ysis.
The primary  efficacy  parameter is defined as follows: The primary  endpoint is set t o 
success if hemostasis is achieved at 5 minutes after the treatment application and is 
maintained until surgical closure. If hemostasis is not achieved at 5 minutes, if additional 
hemostatic treatment other than stud y device is required, or if intraoperat ive rebleeding 
occurs, the primary  endpoint will be set to “treatment failure”.
The primary  effectiveness endpoint will be investigated by  a 2-sided test for 
non-inferiorit y using the confidence -interval (CI) approach to compare the CEL STAT 
group to the Surgicel group. A non- inferiorit y margin of 10% (the largest clinically  
acceptable difference) will be used; thus, if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95%CI(based 
on normal approximation) around the difference in proportions (CEL STAT 
group -Surgicel group) is greater than -10% in the final anal ysis, CEL STAT will be 
declared non -inferior to Surgicel.

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 51of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
The specific h ypotheses of the risk difference to be tested are as follows:
H0: PCELSTAT - PSurgicel ≤ -δ
H1: PCELSTAT - PSurgicel > -δ
where 
PCELSTAT = the proportion (%) of subjects achieving hemostasis b y 5minutes in the 
CEL STAT group,
PSurgicel =the proportion (%) of subjects achieving hemostasis by  5minutes in the 
Surgicel group, and
δ =the non- inferiority  margin of 10% .
Additionally , if the lo wer bound of the 2- sided 95 % CI  is larger than zero, superiority  of 
CEL STAT versus Surgicel will be claimed.
The null hy pothesis will be tested against the alternative using logistic regression, taking 
into account the following covariates: study  center, surgerytype (cardiothoracic, general
or vascular ) andinitial bleeding severity  (mild or moderate).
The primary  safet y analys is,of the difference in proportion of subjects rebleeding from 
the TBS requiring surgical re-exploration during the subject’s stu dy participation, will be 
performed using the same logistic regression model described fo r the primary  efficacy  
endpoint.
13.4.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
The logistic regression model used for the primary anal ysis will also be performed for the 
following secon dary endpoints:
The difference in proportion of subjects having achieved hemostasis at 3minutes 
and which is maintained until surgical closure
The difference in proportion of subjects having achieved hemostasis at 7 minutes 
and which is maintained until surgical closure
The difference in proportion of subjects having achieved hemostasis at 10 minutes 
and which is maintained until surgical closure

CELSTAT Absorbable Hemostat Page 52of 61
Clinical Investigation Plan: Study 3584 -001 Amendment 2: 2015 NOV 0 9
The difference in proportion of subjects with intraoperative rebleeding from the 
TBS after achievement of hemostasis
The TTH will be presented by  Kaplan- Meier curves. In addition, a log -rank test will be 
performed to assess the difference between the distributions of TTH for CELSTAT and 
Surgicel.
AEs that occurred during or after treatment application will be prese nted in summary  
tables. Summary  tables shall indicate the number of subjects who experienced AEs. In 
addition, tables will be prepared to list each AE, the number of subjects in each treatment 
group who experienced an AE at least once, and the rate of subj ects with AEs. AEs 
grouped b y MedDRA system organ class and preferred term will be presented by  severit y 
grade (mild, moderate, severe) and relatedness to treatment (“possibly  related” or 
“probabl y related” AEs will be considered “related”; “unlikel y related” or “not related” 
AEs will be considered “not related”).
All AEs for each subject, including the same event on several occasions, will be listed, 
giving both MedDRA preferred term and the original term used b y the investigator, 
system organ class, severity  grade, seriousness, relation to the treatment, onset date, and 
stop date.
AEs that occurred before the start of treatment application will be listed separatel y.
Clinical laboratory  parameters and vital signs will be summarized by  visit and treatment 
group. Shift tables will be generated for laboratory  parameters.

STUDY DES IGN Protoco l CEL IM-RCD-002 is designed to be a Phase 2a randomized, 
double-blind. placeb o-controlled. parallel group sLudy Lo evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of AMG 714 for the treatme nt or adult patients with 
RCD-11. 
After signing consent subjects will be screened for the study. All 
subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized at a 2: I 
ratio to receive either 8 mg/ kg A MG 714 or placebo a total of 7 times 
over I 0 weeks, with evaluation of the primary endpo int at Week 12. 
AMG 714 (N=16) or placeb o (N=8) will be administered at the clinical 
Sile in a double -blind fashion via intravenous (I Y) infusion over 120 
minutes. 
Concomitam therapy with steroid s at a maximum dose of 20 mg of 
prednisone, prednisolone or equivalent per day and/or oral budcsonide 
at a maximum dose of 9 mg per day will be accepted. These doses will 
need to be stable for 4 weeks prior to randomizati on and remain stable 
for the duration of the study. 
Should AMG 714 show adequate efficacy and safety. as determined by 
the Sponsor. subjects in the study, including those in the placebo arm, 
may be offered participation in an open label extension study of AMG 
7 1 4 m due course, but under no circumstances prior to study 
completion. In the interim , between the end or the study for an 
individua l subject and the slart of the possible open label extension. the 
Sponso r intends to provide a bridging program to allow objective study 
responders to have access to AM G 714 as determined by the site 
investigator or physician. The open label extension study and interim 
bridgi ng program will be described in independen t protocols.

Subjects will be expected to maintain total adhe rence to a strict gluten-
free diet (GFD) from 6 month s before randomization through the final 
study visit (Visit 9, Week I 6/Day 112). Subject's adherence to GFD 
will be assessed by an expe rt dietitian and monitored via stool samp le 
testing using the iVYLISA gluten immun ogenic peptide (GIP) stool 
gluten test. Subjects with known or suspec ted GFD transgressions wi 11 
be counseled and allowed to continu e in the s tudy. 
A study stafT member will contact the subject by phone one day after 
the first dose or study drug to assess for any new or worse ning A Es. 
Subjects will return to the clinic for the next administration of study 
drug after I week (Visit 2. Week I/Day 7). After Visit 2. subject s will 
return to the clinic for follow-up and study drug administration at Visit 
3 (Week 2/Day 14) and every two weeks thereafter as indicated in the 
study schedule of events (Table I). The final study dose will be 
admi nistered at Visit 7 (Week IO /D ay 70). An end-or- study efficacy 
visit will be conducted at Visit 8 (Week 12/Day 84). The tinal study 
visit will be conducted 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug at Visit 
9(Week 16/Day 112). 
All study subjects will undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with 
mucosa! biopsy prior to baseline (i.e., prior to Visit I. Week O /Day 0) 
and within 7 days of Visit 8 (Week 12/Day 84) in order to assess 
changes from baseline in aberrant and abno rmal l ELs, VH :CD ratio. 
TcR clo nality. Marsh score and total IEL counts. 
Subjects enrolled in the study will complete the BSFS at the time or 
each bowel movement from baseli ne (Visit I; Week O /Day 0) up to the 
final study vis it, Visit 9 (Week 16/Day 112). Subjects will complete the 
CeD PRO daily from baseline to the final study visit. Subjects will also 
complete the GSRS beginning at Visit I (Week O /Day 0) and, thereaft er, 
\ eekly from the time of randomiza tion through the final study visit. 
The BSFS. GSRS and the daily CeD PRO will be completed using a 
handh eld electronic diary. In addition , subjects will complete pape r 
quality of life diaries (SF-12 v. 2. EQ-S D and PtGA). Diaries will he 
completed at the times specified in the Schedule of Events (Table I). 
Random ization and initial dosing of the first ten s ubject s will be 
staggered, with no more than two subjects sta rting dosing per week. and 
avoiding the initiation of more than one patient on any single day. 
Safety will be monito red on an ongoing basis and subjects may undergo 
unscheduled visits for safety reasons, if needed. Safety will be assessed

STAT ISTICAL 
ANALYS IS I 0. Participation in another investigational drug or device study or 
treatm ent with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-
lives, whic hever is lon ger, prior to random ization. 
11. An. additional reason, which in the opinion of the Investigator, 
would prevent the subject from safely participatin g in the study 
or comp lying with protoco l requirement s. 
The primary endpoint is the Immun ologica l Response I : reduction at 
Week 12 in the % of aberrant I ELs vs total IELs as assesse d by flow-
cytometry bet\\ een the AMG 7 1 4 dose and the placebo arm. 
The primar y endpoint of Lmmun ological Respon se I will be tested as 
follows: 
again st the alternative 
Hi: µAMG 714 *µplac ebo 
where µAM G 714 and µpla cebo denote the mean baseline to Week 12 
reduc tion in % aberra nt lELs vs total IELs as assesse d by flow-
cytometry in the AMG 714 and placebo arm respect ively. The 
hypothese s wi II be tested using a two-si ded type I error level of I 0%. 
In gemeral, efficacy measu res which require pre- and post-treatme nt 
biopsies will be ba sed on the PP population (at least 2 biops ies, the 
seco nd at least on Week 6 or l ater). Continuous varia bles will be 
analyzed based on the ITT population. 
The primar y endpoint will be analyzed using analysi s of covariance 
(ANC OVA ) based on the Per Protocol populati on (PP), where baseline 
% aberrant lEL will be included as a covar iate and treatment group as 
a fixed effec t in the statistical model. 
Change from baseline of Immun ological Respon se 2, VH:CD and of 
total IEL counts will be analyzed using the same m ethod as for the 
primary endpoint. 
The Marsh scores will be analyzed using a multin omial logistit: 
regre ssion mo del, where treatment group , base! ine Marsh score, and a 
treatment group-by-ba seline Marsh score interac tion term will be 
included in the model. 
The secondary variable BSFS will be analyzed by calcu lating daily and 
week ly numb er and type of bowel movement s. The bowel movement 
count s will be analvzed usinl?. generali zed linear mixed models with

subject as rand om effec t. The statistical model will also includ e 
treatment group. time (week) and their interaction. The c hange in the 
week ly BSFS scores will mainl y be assessed with descript ive statistics. 
where change from the ·normal (mid-sca le)' will be explored. The 
GSRS and the CeO-G SRS will be analyzed using a linear mixed effec ts 
repeat ed measures model (MMRM) with the baseline value, treatm ent 
group, time point, and a time point-by-treatment group interac tion term 
as fixed effect s with an underl ying correlat ion structure between the 
time points that results in the best fit for the mod el. Subject will be 
included as a random e ffect. 
The exploratory variables, which include PK variabl es. PD variabl es, 
PK/PO variables , aberrant and abnormal lELs, TcR clonality ana lyses , 
PGA. quality of life assess ment s and biomarker s of disease activity wi II 
be tabulated by treatment group and time point (if feasible) using the 
ITI or PP popul ations as appropriate. 
The explorator y variable CeO PRO will be analyzed using the same 
method as for the GSRS and CeD-GSRS. 
Pharmacokinetics of AMG 714 in RCD-11 patients will also be 
characterized us ing no nlinear mixed-effects modeling , includin g 
evaluation of effec ts of major cova riates (e.g., weight or body mass 
index [BMI]) , and body surface area [BSA] , sex. biochemical 
parameters, and disease charact eristics at baseline) on AMO 7 14 
exposure. 
Exploratory exposure -response analysis will be performed for efficacy , 
safety . and biornarker measures. 
Change from baseline (by time po int) will also be pr esented for 
redu ction in aberrant and abnormal [£Ls by flow cytome try. 
immunochem istry and TcR clonality analyses, PGA and quality of life 
assess ments (SF- 12 v. 2 and EQ-5 0). 
The safety variabl es, which include AEs (coded using the Medi cal 
Dict ionary for Regulatory Activitie s [MedDRA]) , clinical laboratory 
tests. physical examination findin gs, vital signs a nd immun ogenicity 
will be tabulated by treatment grou p and time point (if feasible) using 
the intent to treat populat ion.

INTROD UCT ION 
1.l BACKGRO UND 
The disease to be treat ed is Refractory Celiac Disease Type II (RCD- 11). an in situ small bov cl 
T cell lymph oma. RCD- 11 appears in ~0.5% of pa tients with celiac disease and has -50% 
probability o f progression to a syste mic Enteropath y-Associated T cell Lymp homa (EATL). 
The treatment-resi stant EA TL has dismal prognosis with <20% surviva l at 5 years. 
Cclimmun e is al so investigating AMG 714 for the treatmen t of diet non-re sponsive celiac 
disease (NRCD ). NRCD and RCD-11 are different diseases, and RCD-11 appears independent 
of gluten consumption. I L-15 plays an over lapping yet distinct pathoph ysiological role in each 
of these diseases . respo nsible for mucosal dama ge in N RCD and for aberrant IEL proliferation 
in RCD-11. 
For the sake of provid ing a comprehen sive background. we describe the presumed responsib le 
mediator (IL- 15). the precursor condition (celiac disease) and. linall y. the specific disease to 
be treated (RCD- IT, the in situ small bowe l T cell lymph oma). 
1.1.1 IL-15 
Interleukin 15 (IL-15), a glycoprotein of approximately 14-15 kDa, is a proinflamm atory 
cytokine with structur al s imilarities to IL-2. IL-15 exerts biological effec ts on man y 
immun o logically relevam cells (Fehniger and Caligiuri. 200 I). While important differe nces. 
discussed below, are pr esent across species. I L-15 generally acts as a development. 
hom eostasis and activat ion factor for NK cells and m emory phenoty pe CDS+ T cells, and it 
induc es the production o f c hemokines and cytokines by these cell types. I L-15 potently 
stimulate s the production of proinflammat ory cytokines such as I L-1, I L-6, and tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TN F-a) by monocytes /macrophages. IL-1 5 produced by follicula r dendriti c cells 
is reported lo support genninal center B cell prolifer ation and immun oglobulin class switchin g 
(Park el al, 2004; Litin skiy et al. 2002). Targeted disrupti on of either the IL- 15 or the IL- 15 
receptor alpha (IL-1 5Ra) genes in mice has been sh own to result in the loss o f N K. N K- T. 
TCRy8 + intraepitheli al lymp hocytes, and mem ory CD8+ cells (Lodolce el al. 1998). In I L-15 
knockout mice. these defects are r eversible by the admini stration o f exogenous I L-15 
(Kenn edy et al, 2000). In contrasL human NK cells are not entirely depend ent on JL-15 (Lebrcc 
el al, 2013 ). 
I L-15 messenger RNA (mRNA ) is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell type s. 
However. expression of I L-15 protein is much more restricted and is subject L O multiple post-
transeriptional control m echanism s. Immun ologically relevant sources of I L-15 protein include 
mon ocyte s, macrophag es, epithelial and tibroblastic cells, and bone ma rrow stromal cells 
(Fehniger and Caligiuri , 200 I). IL-15 and its recepto r are also expressed in some or gans 
outside the immune system; the role of I L-15 in these systems is less well understood. The 
absence of any overt defects outside the immun e system in IL-15 and IL-15 Ra knockout mice 
suggests that I L-15 may not be essential in any o ther system.

I L-15 binds to a hcterotrimcric receptor that cons ists of a p chain that is shared with the I L-2 
receptor (CDl22 or IL-2/IL-15Rf3). the common y chain (yC). shared with the IL-2. -4. -7. -9. 
and -2 1 receptors. and a unique a chain. IL-15 binds with high affin ity to the JL-ISRa chain, 
which then interacts with the I L-2/1 L-1 SRB and the yC. The assoc iation of the I L-15/1 L-15 Ru 
complex with the other two components of the comp lete receptor comple x can occur in a cis 
configura tion where all three receptor component s are present on the same eel I, or in a trans 
configuration where the IL I Sill I 5Ra pair i on one cell and the receptor P and yC chains are 
on another (Schluns et al. 2005 ). I L-15 can also associate with IL-15R a on the cell surface and 
then be cl eaved into soluble cytokine /receptor complexes that have the potenti al to stimulat e 
CD8+ T cells and NK cells (Anthony et al. 2015). 
Increased expre ssion of IL-15 has been demons trated in a variety of innammatory conditi ons. 
includin g rheumat oid arthritis (RA}. psoriasis, inflammato ry bowel disease, graft-ver sus-host 
disease. solid organ transplant rejection (Blaser el al. 2005; Conti et al. 2003 : Gianfrani et al. 
1005; Mcinnes and Gracie. 2004 ) and celiac disease (reviewed in Gianfrani et al. 2005: 
Meressc et al, 2012). 
1.2 CEL IAC DJSEASE 
Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disease trigg ered by gluten cons umpti on in 
genetically suscept ible individual s (Green and Celli er, 2007) . Currently appro ximate ly I% of 
the western populat ion is affected by celiac disease, albeit the vast majority of patients remain 
undiagnosed . T he prevalence is rwi ce that in coun tries with very high hygiene s tandard s and/or 
very high gluten consumpti on. Presently it is estimated that 15-20 milli on patients are affecte d 
by celiac disea se and approximately 1.0-1.5 million patient s are diagno sed. This numb er has 
been reported to be doubling every 20 years ( Riddl e el al, 2012). 
Gluten, the antig en respons ible for celiac disease. is the main protein present in some of the 
most common cereals (wheat, barley. rye). Mod ern diets are increa singly enriched with gluten 
and it is a lso used as an addi tive in processed foods , cosmetics and oral medicati ons. Gluten is 
the seco nd most common food ingredient after sugar and, in some coun tries, is present in up 
lo 80% of food stuff. Gluren is also present in trace amounts in foods labeled as "'gluten-free .. , 
as a tableting excipient. and in products such as t oothpaste and lipstick. As linle as 50 mg/day 
of gluten triggers the disease (Catassi el al, 2007). A no rmal diet contains> I 0 g/day. 200 times 
the amount that causes intestinal histological abnorma lities. As such. celiac patient s face an 
enormous challe nge to follow a strict GFD. 
The pathophysiology of celiac disease is charact erized by an abnormal immune respon se to 
gluten. Gluten. which is normally a well- tolerated dietar y compo nent. elicits innate a nd 
adapti c immune respon ses in celiac patient s (Green and Cellier. 2007) . Hum ans lack enzymes 
to fully diges t gluten.-. hich against the right gene tic backgr ound triggers inflammation and 
autoimmunit y in the intestine and in other organs. An adapl ive immune response is triggered 
when gluten peptides are deamidated in the extrace llular space. by tissue transglutamina se 
(tTG). normally an intrac ellular enzy me that is r eleased by damaged cells. This deamidation 
renders g luten peptides high-avidity binder s to HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. which present these 
peptides to intestinal CD4+ T cells. thereby activating these T cells and initiating the 
inflammatory cascade. The innate immune system's intraepithelial lymphocytes (I ELs).

primarily CD8 +, are able to directly lyse and destroy intestinal epithel ial cells, damaging the 
mucosa I lining of the small intestine. in respon se to the I L-15 relea se. stimulated by gluten 
peptides (Abadie and Jabri, 2014). Jn healthy individuals. the activa ted T cells are controlled 
by regulator y T cells (Tregs), but this does not happe n in celiac disease as I L-15 confe rs the 
effec tor CD4+ T cells resistance to supp ression by Tregs (Abadie and Jabri, 2014). Anti-tTG 
auto-antibodies appear as a hallmark of the celiac autoimmune process and are used in 
accurate ly diagn osing the disease (Green and Cellier. 2007). 
The only currently available strateg y for the manageme nt of celiac disease patients is a lifelong 
total avoidance of gluten. While simple in theory. the ubiquity of gluten make s total avoidance 
of gluten very difficult -if not impo ssible in practice. As little as 50 mg/day (a normal diet 
contains> I 0 gr/day) triggers activation of the T cells of the smal I bowel and cause intestinal 
muco sa! dama ge (Cata ssi el al, 2007). A study by Shah el al (2014) found the burden ofcel iac 
disease and a Gl7D on patient qualit y of life was ranked second only to end-stage renal disease 
- a debi litating and life-threaten ing cond ition that requires polypharmacy and multiple, week ly 
dialysis treatment s. For these reasons. celiac patient s are unable to comply with a zero gluten 
diet, and more than 50% of diagno sed patient s on a GFD continue to present active disease and 
intestinal immun e activation and mucosa! atrophy (Lee et al, 2003; Cranney et al. 2007 : 
Hopper et al, 2007; Midhagen et al 2003). Celiac patients who continue to have symptoms 
despite attempting to maintain a GFD are deemed to have diet ·'non-r espons ive celiac disease·· 
or NRCO. NRCD has been defined as "persistent symptoms , signs or laboratory abnomialities 
typical of celiac disease desp ite 6-12 month s of dietary gl uten avoidance" (Rub io-Tapi a et al, 
2013). Morta lity is increase d in subjects with persistent intestinal mucosal dama ge 
(Ludvigsson et al. 2009). 
1.2.1 Refractory Celiac Disease 
A rare but specific complication of persistent diet non-responsive celiac disease is the 
development of Refrac tory Celiac Disea se (RCD). which aITecl s approximately I% of celiac 
patients (Lebwohl el al, 2013) and is characteri zed by severe gastrointestinal symptom s in the 
absence of gluten consumpt ion and in the presence of small bowel aberrant imraepithelial 
lymphocytes (lELs) (reviewed in Verbeck et al 2008, and in van Wanrooij et al. 2014). 
Refractory Cel iac Disease patients can be further classified accordin g to the number of aberrant 
lELs. Patients with low numbers of aberrant IELs, defined as less than 20 % of total IELs. as 
determi ned by now cytometry. are referred to as having Type I RCD (RC D-1). and are not at 
increased risk of developing overt extra-epithelial lymphoma. otherwise referred to as 
enteropathy-assoc iated T cell lymphoma , (EA TL), and have a normal 5-yea r survival (van 
Wan rooij et al. 2014 ). 
When the number s of aberra nt IELs exceed the 20% threshold. referr ed to as Type IT RCD 
(RCD-Jl ), the risk of deve loping EAT L is dramatically increased to >50% (Nijeboe r et al. 
20 I 5a, 2015b). EA TL has a very poor 5-yea r survival of <20% (Nijeboer et al, 20 I 5a) and its 
prevalence is increasing (Shara i ha et ul. 2012). 
Protocol CEL IM-RCD-002 
Version 3, I 1-JUL-20 16 
Page 29of13-t Confidential 
In RCD-1 1. aberrant IELs proliferate in what represent s a sl ow-growing non-H odgkin 
lymphoma locali zed (in situ) in the small bowel. primarily in the epithelial compartment. The 
aberrant IELs observed in RCD-11 patients have been demonstrated to be precursors or the 
extra-epithelial lymphoma by observa tion that the TcR rearrangement repertoire is similar to 
that seen in sequential biopsies taken from RCD-11 patients who devel oped EA TL. Mon oclonal 
I ELs are demo nstrated in most patients. which is why RCD-11 is cons idered to be an in situ lo'vv-
grade lymphom a. A thorough study of the low grade IEL proliferation in RCD -11 has revea led 
a characteristic phenotype (presence of intracellular CD3without surface CD3 or TcR and 
generall y no C D8 expressio n with expressio n of CD I 03). that is also shared by the high grade 
EA TL proliferations. This phen otype is distinct from the nonnal phenotype of IE Ls in 
uncomplicated celiac disea se and. together with the presence of a clonal TcR rearrangement in 
the intestinal biopsy , confirm s the diagnos is ofRCD-11 and allows follow-up of the expan sion. 
Clinical guidelines (Rubio-Tapia et al. 2013) suggest 12 months of persistent disease activity 
while on a GFD as the timeframe that should trigger the suspicion and eventual diagno sis of 
NRCD and then RCD . Howeve r, the c urrent study uses 6 months as the required time on GFQ, 
since all patient s are evalua ted for aberrant IELs >20% by flow cytometry (or >50% by IHC). 
representing definitive evidence of RCD-11 in the context of all other inclusion and exclusion 
criteria of the study (Nijeboer et al, 2015b ). This definitiv e evidence obviates the n eed to 
c aluate the diet for a full year. a requir ement only necessary when advanced diagnostic 
technique s arc unavailable and diagnosi s is made by clinical exclusion alone. This approach 
wi II reduce both the risk or comp lications and disease ~volution if a patient was required to wait 
for 12 month s before receiving a diagnosi s. Nevertheless. it is expected that a majority of 
patient s enrolled -if not all-will have been on a GFD for longer than a year. Spontaneous 
remission of RCD has not been documen ted in the literature. neither within the initial 6 months 
post-diagnosis. nor after this time. 
For the purpose of this study, and in agreement with leading experts in RCD- 11 (Malamut et 
al. 2010; Nijeboer et al. 2015a, 201 5b). aberrant IELs will be defined by flow cytometry as 
surface CD3- negative. intra-cellular CD3-positive IELs (sCD3-. icCDJ +). The cut-off chosen 
for diagnosis of RCD-11 is 20% in accordance with most recent studies (Nijeboer er al. 20 I 5b ). 
In J HC. these cells are identified as icCDJ + sCD8- and the cut-off is 50% (Nijebocr cl al. 
2015b). 
Additionally. standa rd flow diagrams for the diagnosis of RCD- 11 (e.g., Rubi o-Tap ia el al, 2013) 
and exclusion of conditions that could simulate RCD-11 clinica lly and histologicall y are 
considered in the inclu sion/exc lusion criteria.

1.2.2 Current Treatment of Refractory Celiac Disease 
The treatment of RCD is difficult. Abnormal lymph ocytes are scatte red in the whole small 
intestinal epithelium and usually in the stomac h and colon. thereby precludin g surgery. 
Currently, there is no s tandard of care for RCD-1 or RCD-11. In RCD-1. corticosteroid (local or 
systemic) , azathioprine. purineth ol. anti-TNF agents. or cladribine may be used with limit ed 
success (Brar et al. 2007; Goerre s et al. 2003) . In RCD- 11, budesonide (Brar ct al. 2007), 
cladribine (Tack et ul, 2011 a) and autologous bone marrow transplantati on (Tac k et al. 20 I I h) 
have also been Ltsed with different degree s of success. and better outcomes for autol ogous 
BMT (Nijeboer et al, 20 l Sb). The progno sis of RCD-11 is still poor with death occurring within 
3-10 years due mainl y to intractable diarrhea and/or d evelopment of high grade EA TL 
lymphomas or. more rarely, to disseminati on of the low grade prolif eration to o ther tissues 
(e.g .. skin, lungs). The treatment of the high grade lymphoma (EA TL) relies on s urgical 
resec tion and chemotherapy, but the prognosis is very poor. 
An effec tive treatment for RCD-11 that could reduce the presence of aberrant I ELs and alleviate 
the histological abno rmalitie s and/or the symptom s. remain s the highe st priority. 
1.3 ROLE OF IL-15 lN CELIAC DISEASE 
Substantial evidence sugges ts a pathophysiological role for IL-15 in celiac disease and RCD-
1 1 (reviewed in Abadie and Jabri et al. 2014): 
• Innat e immunit y: 
Protoco l CELIM-R C 0-002 
Version 3, I l-JUL-20 16 
Page 3 I of 134 Confid ential 
o I L-15 is an essential, non-redundant growth and activation factor for the I Els 
which destroy the intestinal muco sa: 
o The expre ssion of IL-15 in the intestinal epithelium is necessary for villous 
atrophy: 
o In some patients , I L-15 drives progres sion toward s lymphomagencsi s and 
potentially fatal RCD-11 (Malamut et al. 2010) 
• Adaptive immunit y: 
o I L-15 enhances the presentati on of deamidated gluten peptides (DGP) by 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs): 
o I L-15 renders the activated CD4+ T cells resistant to inhibition by regulat ory T 
cells: 
o I L-15 has been proven to be a key facto r in the loss of tolerance L o food antigens 
(De Paolo el al. 2011; Korneychuk, et al. 2014) 
By activating the intraepithelial lymphocytes (I ELs). IL-15 is believed to be the main mediator 
in the mucosa ! damage that ensues in respo nse to gluten exposure in celiac disease 
(Komeychuk et al, 2014 ). The expre ssion of IL-15 in the intestinal epithe lium is necessary for 
villous atrophy in animal models of c.:eliac disease and circumstantial evidence suggests this to 
be the case in humans, as well. In addition, I L-15 render effec tor T cells resistant to inhibition 
by regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Abadie and Jabri. 2014 ). promoting loss of tol erance to food 
antigens (DePaolo et of. 2011. Korneychuk et al. 2014). 
One of the studied mouse models ofce liac disease is an IL-IS-transgen ic mouse. in which IL-
1 5 overexpre ssion by gut epithe lial cells leads to celiac-like disease. includin g T and B eell-
mediated pathology (Yokoyama el al. 2009 and 20 I l ). I EL apoptosis has been obse rved in this 
animal model after treatment with anti-I L-15 (Malamut el nl 20 I 0) or anti-I L-15-reccptor 
mAb s (Yokoyama el al 2009). 
In RCD-11. the role oflL-15 appear s even clearer. and IL-15 is believed to be the main driver 
of transfonnati on and maintenance of the aberrant I ELs (Meresse et al, 2012). lL-15 is up-
rcgu lated in the intestinal mucosa of patients with RCD-11 and, more important ly. incub ation 
of RCD-ll patient duod enal biopsie s with the anti-JL-1 5 monoclonal antibody. AMG 714. 
blocked anti-apoptotic signaling via JAK3 and ST ATS. leading to apoptosis of rhe clonal 
aberra nt I Els (Malamut et al, 20 I 0. reviewed in Mere sse et al 2012). 
1.4 AMG 714 
AMG 714, a fully human immunogl obulin (lgG l K) monoclonal antibody (former ly HuMax-
IL 15. Genmab) , binds to and inhibits the function of IL-15 in all its forms (cis, trans. soluble 
IL-15 bound to IL-15Ra. ). AMG 714 inhibit s IL-15-induced Tcell proliferati on and shows a 
dose-dependent inhibiti on of IL-15-induced TNF-a. production. AMG 714 was originally 
produced in a hybridoma cell line. The hybridoma-d erived material (referred to in this 
document as AMG 714-HYB) underwent preclinical testing and was subseque ntly evaluated 
in a Phase I and Phase 2 stud in sub.eels with rheumat oid arthritis (Baslund et al. 2005) . •

been tested in two studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with psoriasis. All future cli nical 
studies will be performed with AMG 714-CHO. 
1.5 SUMMARY OF PRE-CLINICAL STUD IES 
The nonclini cal deve lopment of AMG 71 4 consisted of a series of in vitro studie s 
demo nstrating the binding properties of AMG 714 against hlL-15: in vitro and vivo studie 
providing proof-of-concept for the benefit of blocking the IL- 15 pathway in celiac disease: and 
a series of GLP studies evaluatin g the nonc linical safety profile of Hu714MuXHu, the AMG 
714 surrogate molecule active in macaques. The full description of the pre-clinical studies can 
be found in the Investigator's Brochure. 
1.5.J Pharmacology 
In nonc linical expe riments conducted w ith the original hybridoma-derived antibody, AMG 
714-HYB was found to recognize an epitope that is essential for the interaction b etween human 
IL- 15 (hl L-15 ) and its rece ptor co mplex. AMG 714-HYB showed a d ose-dependent inhibiti on 
of 1 L- 1 5-induced proliferation of pe ripheral bl ood T cells. and cell lines expressing rL-1 S 
receptors, as well as a dose-dependent inhibiti on of hlL-1 5-induced TNF-a production. 
Specificity for lL-15 was demons trated by lack of inhibitory effects on human IL-2 (hlL-2)-
mediated prolifera tion of pe ripheral blood Tce lls, on hlL-2-mediated TNF-a producti on. or on 
IL-2 induced cytotoxic T cell line (CTLL2) cell prolif eration. 
AMG 714-CHO was found to be efficacio us in a mouse model of celiac disease triggered by 
the transgenic expressio n of human I L- 1 S in the gut epithelium (Malam ut et al. 20 I 0). In this 
model, AMG 714-CHO prevented IEL activati on and proliferation, as well as histological 
abnormalities. In additi on. A MG 714-CHO w as able to induce apoptosis of human IELs in ex 
vivo cultur e of small intestinal explants from active celiac disease and RC0-11 patients 
(Malamut er al. 20 I 0). In this culture expe riment. AMG 71 4-C HO resulted in a suppression of 
IL-15-d riven anti-apoptotic sig nalin g via JAK3 and STA T5. 
1 n vitro studie s demons trated that AMG 714-CHO had high bindin g affinit y for hi L-15, but 
lower affinity for macaque lL-15 . Additi onally, AMG 714-CHO neutrali zed hlL-15 but did 
not efficiently neutralize macaqu e IL-15. To ena ble preclinical studies in macaques. a 
surrogate ant ibody, Hu7 I 4MuXHu, was deve loped by fus ing the F(ab) portio n of a mou se anti-
hlL- 15 mono clonal antibody know n to neutralize macaque IL-15, M I 11, with human lgG I Fe;. 
Hu714MuXHu was shown to ne utralize macaque IL-15 with approx imately the same potency 
as AMG 714-CHO neutralizes hlL- 15.

1.5.2 Toxicology 
Becau se of the low bindin g affinity of AMG 7 14 for macaque I L-15 and the very low inhibit ory 
activ ity of AMG 714 again st macaque IL-15. the safety profile of AMG 7 14-CHO has been 
evaluated in nonc linical studies in non-hum an primates (cynomo lgus monkeys) using the

1.6.2 Pharmacodyna mics of AM G 7 14 in Hum a ns 
The effects of AMG 714-HYB and AMG 714-CHO on NK cell coun ts were explored in three 
Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies (Hx-ILI 5-00 I, 20030210, 20060349) using immun ophenotypin g 
that included markers specific for NK cells. This analysis was based on the observed 
pharmacodynamic effects in preclinical spec ies. No changes in absolute or relative number s of 
NK cells were observed in either study at any or the dose levels tested. This result contrasts 
with observa tions in cynomolgus monkeys. where a marked reduction in N K cell counts was 
noted after admini stration of the s urrogat e antibody. Hu714Mu XHu. 
This difference between observat ions in preclinical and clinical studies appears related to a 
differential sensitivity of human versus cynomolgus monke y N K cells to I L-15 deprivation. 
Human NK cells are not dependent on IL-15 for their surv ival (Leb rec et al. 2013). possibly 
due to the redundant role of IL-2 on human NK cells.

I. 7.1.J Study Hx-ILJ 5-001 
Phase 1 Study Hx-IL 15-00 I was exec uted in 2 stages in subject s with RA. The first stage was 
a randomized. double -blind, placebo-controlled. single esca latin g dose design (0.15. 0.5. 1.0. 
2.0. 4.0, and 8.0 mg/kg AMG 714-HYB), followed by a second stage that was a repeat dose 
(0.5. 1.0. 2.0. and 4.0 mg/kg AMG 714-HYB; 5 doses over 8 weeks), open-label exte nsion. 
Twenty-eight of JO subjec ts comple ted the single dose stage of the study. and 20 of24 subjects 
comp leted the repeat-dose stage. 
Evaluations of efficacy included ACR response assessment. Following a single dose of 
investigati onal product, the ACR20 response rate was similar in the AMG 7 14-HYB groups 
compa red with placebo. Howeve r. repeated doses of AMG 714-HYB led to gr eater ACR20 
response rates, without a clear dose response (Baslu nd et al, 2005).

1.7.1.2 Study 20030210 
In Phase 2 Study 2003 0210. subjects were enrolled in two cohorts. wilh 110 subjects in Cohort 
I random ized equall y to placebo or AMG 7 14-HYB (40, 80, 160, or28 0 mg) and an additi onal 
70 subje cts in Cohort 2 randomized equall y to plncebo or 280 mg AMG 7 14-HY B. The prim ary 
efficacy endpoint was the 14-week ACR20 respo nse rate in the 280 mg grou p compa red with 
placebo after 12 weeks of study treatment. Seconda ry endpoints included the 14-week ACR50 
and ACR 70 response rates (50% . and 70% impro vement in the ACR criteria from baseline); 
ACR respo nse rates throughout the study: the ch ange from base line in individual ACR 
components; and the disease activ ity score (DAS28) . 
The ACR20 respon se rate in the 280- mg group (Cohorts l and 2 comb ined) increased over 
placeb o at 14 weeks (54% vs 38%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 
0.097. Cochran-M nntel-H aenszel test). Ho wever. a statistica lly significant differ ence in 
ACR20 response in the 280 mg group compa red with placebo was observed at weeks 12 (64% 
vs 34%; p = 0.003) and 16 (66% vs 38%: p = 0.003). The overall distribut ion of the DAS28 
scores (nonresponder imputatio n) decrea sed significantly in the 280-mg group compared with 
placebo at weeks 8. 12, and 16 (p = 0.02. 0.005. and 0.0 I. respectively. Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test), with medians of 5.1 vs 6.1. 4.9 vs 5.8, and 4.9 vs 5.7 (280 mg vs placebo). For observed 
data. a simila r trend was observed. The mean score in the 280 mg group decreased from 6.8 al 
baseline to a low o f 4.9 at week 16. Add itional ly. all of the intermediate-range dose groups 
showed an impr ovement over placebo. Additionally, impro vements were evident in ACR 
compo nents and especially in acute phase reactants. Beginnin g al week 4, concentrations of 
acute phase reactants decreased significantly in the 280 mg AMG 7 I 4-H YB group compared 
with placeb o (C-rcactive protein [CRP], p < 0.000 I; erythrocyte sedimentation rate fESRj. p 
= 0.005), and rema ined significantly decrea sed throughout the study. Of note. CRP 
concentrations in the 280 mg AMG 714- HYB group decreased by 60% al week 4 and remained 
50% to 67% lowe r than CRP conce ntrations in the placebo group for the remainder o f the 
study. Significant improvements also were seen in other ACR components (weeks 12 and 16) 
and in DAS28 (weeks 8. 12. and 16). 
Although the primary efficac y endpoint (significant difference in ACR20 responses at week 
14 for subjects who received 280 mg AMG 7 14-HYl3 compa red with placebo) was not met. 
the overa ll clini cal results sugges ted AMG 714- 1 IYB pharm acological activi ty, as indicated by 
the reduction of acute phase reactant concen trations and the efficacy of /\MG 714- 1 lYB in the 
treatme nt of RA refractory to disease-m odifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD s).

occurred at any dose during the study. 
All 30 subject s received the initial double-blind dose. and of the 24 subjects who entered the 
repeat dosing period. two subject s in the 0.5-m g/kg group withdr ew from the study due to 
worsening of RA. and two subject s in the 4-mg/kg repeated -dose group (8 mg/kg s ingle dose) 
withdr ew consent for participation. 
Durin g the double-b lind, single-do se period. adver se event s were re ported by 8 of 30 (27%) 
subject s. and rates were similar among dose coho rts. All reported adverse even ts were mild to 
moderate in seve rity. Two subject s reported infections during this period. One subject in the 
0.15-mg/kg coho 1i reported herpe s simplex, and I subject in the 4 mg/kg cohort report ed 
nasopharyn gitis. One serious adver se event occu rred in a subject in the 0.15 mg/kg cohort. The 
subject was hospitali zed because of RA nare and the disea se nare was considered by the 
investigator to be unrelated to investigational product. One subject in the 0.5 mg/kg cohort 
repo rted mild pyrexia and rigors and subsequently withdrew from the study prior to continuing 
into the open-label. repeat-dose stage. Treatment is unknown . ho wever. the subject fully 
recovered from the reported events . 
Durin g the open-label. repea t-dose period, 15 of 24 (63%) subjects reported adverse events. 
also with similar rates among cohorts. All report ed adver se events were mild to moderat e in 
severity. Five subjects repor ted infections durin g this period. One subject in the 0.5 mg/ kg 
cohort had an upper respirator y tract infection. sinusitis. and a urinary tract infection: three 
subject s in the I mg/kg cohort had an upper respirat ory tract infecti on. nasopharyngiti s. and 
pneum onia. respectively: and one subject in the 2 mg/kg cohort had bronchiti s and herpe s 
simplex . One subject in the 0.5 mg/kg cohort withdr ew from the study after 3 repeated doses 
due to an upper respirat ory tract infec tion described as being moderate in seve rity. 
No clinic ally significant chan ges in laboratory parameter s were obse rved, no depletion of NK

treatment groups. The most frequently occurrin g events in the 280 mg group were 
nasopharyngiris (5% vs 2% in placeb o group) and pharyngiti s (5% vs 2% in placebo group). 
Serious infectious events were reported by two subjects: one in the placeb o group (viral 
bronchiti s), and one in the 80 mg AMG 714-HYB grou p (sepsis); the serious adverse event of 
sepsis led to study withdra wal. Adver se events leadin g to withdrawal occurred in five subje cts, 
all o f whom were in the intermediate /\MG 714-HYB dose groups ( I [40 mg], 2 [80 mg]. and

Clinical laboratory assessmen ts sh owed only minor differences between placebo and AMG 
714-HYB treatment groups and no depletion ofNK cells. One serious event (sepsis). repo rted 
by a subject in the 80 mg cohort. was associated with Common Toxicit y Criteria grade 4

recove red. No subject developed antibodies to AMG 714-HYB. 
1.8.2 Safety in AMG 714~CHO Clinical Studies 
1.8.2 .J Study 20050193 
Of the 43 subjects enrol led in the study. 40 subjects (93%) received one dose of AMG 714 or 
placebo and were analyzed for safety. Three subjects did not receive investigat ional produ ct 
(two subjects due to assess ment of ineligibiliry and one subject due to a change in eligibility 
status). Thirty-n ine of 40 subjects (98%) completed the study; one s ubje ct who recei ved I 00 
mg AMG 7 14 SC discontinued due to non-stud y related reasons. 
AMG 714 was genera lly well tolerated at all doses admini stered during the study. No deaths, 
serious adverse events. or study discontinuati ons due to adve rse event s were reported. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported across all dose level s by subject s who 
received invcstigational product. No relation ship was appa rent between the subject incid ence 
of treatment-emergent adve rse event s and the dose of AMG 714. or betw een the subject 
incidence of treatment-emergent adverse even ts and the route or adm inistration of AMG 7 14 
(SC versus IV). Twenty of thirty subjects (67% ) who received AMG 714 and seven of ten 
subject s (70%) who r eceived placeb o repo rted treatment-relat ed adverse even ts. All but e ight 
adve rse even ts were reported as mild in severity ; seve n adver se events were moderate and one 
event was severe. The severe adver se event was a tooth infection (placebo), and was not 
cons idered by the investigator as relat ed to investigati onal produ ct. Four of the seve n moder ate 
adve rse events were reported as relat ed to investigational produ ct: injection site pain (I 00 mg 
AMG 714 SC). upper respirator y tract infecti on (700 mgAMG 714 SC), headac he (100 mg 
AMG 714 IV), and gastroente ritis ( I 00 mg AMG 714 IV). Thre e of the seven mo derate events

were reported as not related to investigati onal product: diarrhea (placebo). lowe r respirat ory 
tract infect ion (placebo), and vessel puncture . site bruise (700 mg AMG 7 J 4 SC). Among the 
fort) subjects who recei ed investigational product , the most commonly repo rted adver se 
event was injection site reaction in five subject s ([I 7%J (700 mg AMG 7 14 SC), and 2 subjec ts 
[20% ] (placebo). A II inject ion site reacti ons were conside red by the investigator to be treatment

two in placebo f20% ]), pharyn golaryngeal pain (four in AMG 714 [ 13%1), and upper 
respiratory tract infection (four in AMG 714 [ 13%]). No clinically important effects of AMG 
714 on selected laborator y variabl es, ECGs . or other vital signs were evident. Additionally. 
treatment with AMG 714- CHO did not result in a specific reduction in NK-c ells. One serum 
sample from Day 57 from I subject in cohort 5 (100 mg. IV) ' as positive for anti-AMG 7 14 
binding and neutralizing antibodies, but with no no ticeable reduction in serum AMG 714 
concentration at any time during the study. 
1.8.2.2 Study 20060349 
Subject Disposition: In total. 22 subject s were enrolled into this study; o f these. 20 (91 %) 
subjects received al least one SC dose of investigational product and were included in the safely 
analysis set. Overall. 17 (77%) subject s received all six planned doses of investigational 
product; 16 (7 3%) subject s comple ted all study visits and completed the study. 
Twenty subjects received ~ I dose of investigati onal product and were included in the princip al 
analysis of safety (six placebo , six AMG 714 150 mg. eight AMG 714 300 mg). Ther e were 
no deaths. serious adverse events. or study withdrawals because of an adverse event reported 
durin g this study. One subject {/\MG 714 300 mg) discontinu ed investigational product in 
respon se lo an adverse event of worsening psoriasis. but completed all study assessment s. 
Overall, most (90%) subjects had~ I adverse event. Adverse events were no more common in 
the AMG 714 groups than in the placeb o group and were not dose-relat ed (ti e [83% ] AMG 
714 150 mg. seve n [88%] AMG 7 J 4 300 mg. and six [I 00%1 placebo subjec ts). Across 
treatment groups . the most commonly reported adverse events were headach e (six subject s. 
30%). upper respiratory tract infection (four subjects. 20%). and nasopharyngiti s (three 
subjects. 15%). The overall subject incid ence of treatme nt-related adverse events was 45%. 
with heada che being the most common among all subjects (occ urring in I. 2, and 2 subjects in 
the placebo. AMG 714 150 mg. and /\MG 714 300 mg grou ps, respect ively); no o ther 
treatment-related adverse event was experienced by more than one subject. 
lmmun ophenotyping findin gs revealed everal notable differences between subject s in the 
placebo and AMG 714 groups; howeve r, these differenc es were isolated. and appea red to be 
driven by cha nce due to rhe large numb er of comparisons. No depletion ofNK cells occurred. 
None of the treatment differences appeared to be c linicall y signifi cant. Change s from baseline 
in hematology. chemistry. and urinal ysis laboratory results were not c linic ally meanin gful. 
Out-of-ran ge value s were generally intermittent and indiscriminate. as were the minor shifts in 
either direction that were evident for most hemat o logy and chemistr y parameters. No out-of-
range laborator y result was repo rted as an adverse event. No subject developed bindin g. non-
neutrali zing antibodies. and none o f the tested sample s in the immun oassay were positive for

binding antibodie s at anytime point. No clinically important observations in ECG or vital signs 
were reported. 
2 KNOWN AND ANTICIPATED RISKS 
2.1 NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELL DEPLETION ANO RISK OF 
INFECTION 
NK cell counts and NK cell activity were sig nificantly decrease d by blocking IL -15 in 
cynomol gus monkeys. This effect is thought to be a consequence of a pharma codynami c 
response, given the known role of IL-15 in NK cell biology in monkeys and other animal 
specie s. Episodes of diarrhea requir ed treatment with enrofloxac in in severa l animals. These 
obse rvatio ns st arted approximately two to three weeks after initiation of treatment in some 
animals and as late as I 0 weeks after initiation of treatment in one animal. Shigefla infecti ons 
were diagnosed via st ool culture in most of the animal s treated for diarrhea episodes. Given 
the described ro le of N K activity in the defen se against Shigella spec ies, the observed effec t 
on NK cells is cons idered a possible adve rse event in the cynomo lgus mon key. 
In contrast, no r eduction of N K cells has been observed in human s, and gastroenteritis and 
enteric infections have not been reported as a frequent adve rse event in human studies. 
Expe rimental work has conclud ed that human NK cells, unlike murin e and non-human prima te 
N K eel Is. are n ot dependent on lL-J 5 for their survival and funct ion (Le brec et al, 2013). The 
absence of NK eel I depleti on in human s reduces concerns , and the risk of enteric infections 
will be closely mo nitored in fotthcomi ng clinical studies includ ing the proposed CELIM-RCD-
002 and CELIM- N RC D-00 I. 
T he s ponsor interpret s the lack of efficacy in psoriasis as suggestive of AMG 714"s selective 
effect on s pecific immun e pathways , rather than a broad systemic jmmun e suppr ession (since 
most systemic immun e suppr essants are efficac ious in psoriasis). 
2.2 IMMUNOGENICITY 
lmmun ogenicity (generation of a nti-drug antibodies [AD A]) is a potential risk for any b iologic 
therapeutic. Irnmun ogenic ity may lead to injection reactio ns and to loss of efficacy when the 
antib odies are neutrali zing and high-titer. 
AMG 714- 1 IYB and AMG 7 14-C HO are fully hum an anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibodies. Only 
one of the approximately 200 subject s dosed with active drug in all four studies conducted with 
Protoco l CEL IM-RCD- 002 
Version 3, 11-JLJL -2016 
Page 43 of 134 Confidential 
AMG 714 devel oped anti-AMG 714 antibodies (single time point .. neutrali zing). with no 
impact on PK. 
In summ ary, immun ogen icity has been excep tionally reported with AMG 714. and the risk of 
immun ogenicity will be closely monitored with robust and fully validated assays . Any p ositive 
ADA will be monitored. even atler completion of the study and study databa se lock. until the 
ADA level return s to baseline, unless the subject is maint ained on AMG 71 4 outside of the 
scope of the study (i.e., in case of an extension in dosing). 
2.3 INJECT ION SJTE REACTION AND ANAPHYLAX I S 
In AMG 714 studies. injecti on s ite reactions have been mild and have appeared with low 
frequ ency (typica lly below I 0%). There have not been any repor ts of anaphy lax_is to AMG 
714. All administrations of study drug will be mo nitored for I ho ur to detect any possible 
injec tion site reaction and/or anaph ylaxis. 
3 RATIONALE 
There is considerable unmet need in celiac disease. and espec ially in RCD -11, an in situ small 
bowel T cell lymphoma which has 50% frequency of progression to overt systemic lymphoma 
(EA TL). the latter ch aracte rized by very poor prognosis (<20% survival at 5 years). There are 
no medications approved for RCD-11. 
Interleukin 15 (IL- 15) is cons idered to be a central regulator of celiac disease 
immunopatholo gy and a non-redundant driver of lymph omagenesis in RCD-11. AMG 714 is a 
fully human monoclonal antibody which binds to bioaclive IL-IS and has been well-tolerated 
with demonstrated clinical and biochemical effec ts in RA. AMG 714 has been studied in 
approxima tely 200 subjects to dare. includin g approximately 140 subjects dosed for 12 weeks.

6 STUDY DESIGN 
Protocol CELIM-RCD-002 is designed to be a Phase 2a randomized. double-blind, placebo -
contro lled. parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMG 714 for the 
treatment of adult patients with RDC- 11, an in situ sma ll bowel T cell lymphoma. 
After signing consen t, subjects will be screened for the study. All subjects who meet the study 
entry criteria will be randomized 2: I ratio to receive either 8 mg/kg AMG 714 or placebo a 
total of 7 times over I 0 weeks, with evaluation of the primary endpoint at Visit 8 (Week 12/Day 
84). 
AMG 714 (N= 16) or placebo (N=8) will be administered at the clinical site in a double-bli nd 
fashion via intravenous (IV) infusion of approximately 120 minute s (2 hours) duratio n. 
Subjects will remai n confined to the study site for a minimum or I hour after the admi nistration 
of study medication. Durin g this time the Investigator and study site stalTw ill assess the subject 
for A Es. As per Table I. PK samp les are to be collected prior to the infusion and I hour after 
the infusion, at the end of this obse rvation period. The beginning and end of the infusion. as 
well as the PK sample collection times , will be recorded. 
In addition to receiving study medicat ion (AMG 714 or placebo). concomitant therapy with 
steroids at a maxim um dose of20 mg of predn isonc. prednisolone or equiva lent per day and/or 
oral budesonide at a maximum dose of 9 mg per day will be accepted. Steroid doses must be 
stable for 4 weeks prior to randomization and remain stable for the duration or the sLudy. 
Budesonide has been used in RCD-11 with improvement of symptoms and is considered 
adequate background therapy for RCD-11 (Brar et al, 2007). 
Should AMG 7 1 4 show adequaLe efficacy and safety. as determined by the Sponsor. subjects 
in the study. including those in the placebo arm. may be offered participation in an open label 
extension study of AMG 714 in due course . but under no circumstances prior to study 
comp letion. In the interim , between the end of the study for an individual subject and the start 
of the possible open label t:xtension. the Sponsor intends to provide a bridging progra m to 
allow objec tive study responders to have access to AMG 714 as determined by their site 
investigator or physician. The open label extension study and interim bridging program will 
be described in independent protocols. 
Subjec ts will be expected to maintain total adherence to a GFD from 6 months before 
randomi zation through the final study visit (Visit 9; Week 16/Day I 12). Subject's adherence 
to the GFD will be assessed by an expe rt dietitian and monitored via stool sample testing using 
the iYYLISA GIP stool gluten Lest. Subjects with known or suspected GFD transgressions will 
be counseled and allowed to continue in the study. 
A study site staff member will contact each subject by telephone one day after the first study 
drug administration to assess for AEs. Subjec ts will return to the clinic for the ne:-rt 
administration of study drug after I week (Visit 2; Week I/Day 7). After Visit 2. subjects will 
return to the clinic for follow-up and study drug administra tion at Visit 3 (Week 2/Day 14) and 
Protoco l CELIM -RC D-002

every two weeks thereafter as indicat ed in the study schedul e of events (Tab le I). The final 
dose of study drug will be admini stered at Visit 7 (Week 1 O /Day 70). An end-of-study efficacy 
visit will be conduct ed at Visit 8 (Week 12/Day 84). The final study vis it will be conduct ed 6 
weeks after the last dose or study drug at Visit 9 (Week 16/Day I 12). 
Subjects who meet all other study entry criteria will unde rgo upper gastrointestinal cndoscOp} 
with biopsy collection prior to baselin e (i.e., prior to Vis it I. Weck O !Day 0) and within 7 days 
of Visit 8 (Week 12/Day 84) in order to assess chan ges from baseline to end of treatm ent in 
aberra nt and abnormal IELs. VH:CD ra tio. TcR clonality and Marsh score. 
Subject s enrolled in the study will complete the BSFS at the time or each bowel moveme nt 
from baseline (Visit I; Week O /Day 0) up to the final study visit. Visit 9 (W eek 16/Day 112). 
Subjects will complete the CeD PRO daily from baseline up to the final study visit. Subjects 
will also complete the GSRS beginning at Visit 1 (W eck O!Day 0) and. thereafter, weekly from 
the time of randomi zation through the final study visit. The BSFS. GSRS and the daily CeD-
PRO will be completed u sing a hand held electroni c diary. In additi on. s ubjects will complete 
paper qualit y of life diarie s (SF-12 v. 2, EQ5D and PtGA ). Diaries will be completed at the 
times specified in the Schedule of Events (Tab le 1 ). Safety will be monit ored on an on going 
basis and subjects may undergo unscheduled visits if needed for safety reasons. Safety will be 
assessed throughout the sLudy by c linical laboratory tests, physical examinati on. viral signs and 
AE monitoring. lmmun ogenicity will also be monitored.

An interim analys is for safety and PK will be conducted when the tenth subject reaches Vis it 
4 (Wee k 4/Day 28). The interim analysis. to be pre-specified in the DSMB charter. will be 
performed by an independent DSMB which will also monitor unblinded safety data throughout 
the study. Jn addition to safe t y and PK, any other informati on availab le at the time of the 
analysis will be cons idered and a recommendati on to stop, cont inue or modify the study will 
be mad e by the DSMB to the Sponsor. Should the exposure of AMG 714 be below the 
anticipated range. a root analysis w ill be done, which could result in a protocol ame ndment. 
The recommendation and decision will be shared with the investigational sites and ethics 
committ ees. 
7 RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT

11 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
All study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedu le of Events (Tabl e I). 
All visits. except the Follow-up Phone Call. Visit 2 (Week I /Day 7) and Visit 9 (Week 16/Day 
I 12) should be cond ucted within +/-3 days from the sched uled visit day relati ve to the 
randomization vi sit (unless otherwi se indicated). The Follow-up Phone Call shou ld be 
conducted within + I day from the randomization (Visit I; Week O /Day 0) visit date. The Visit 
1 {Week I /Day 7) study drug admini stration must be conducted on the schedu led visit date 
relative to the date of randomization. This visit cannot be conducted early and, shou ld it be 
conduc ted late, the visit schedule must be adjusted based on the actua l date of Visit 2 (Week 
I/Day 7). The Visit 8 endoscopy and biopsy (not the visit, but the e ndoscopy and biopsy only) 
can be conducted within+ /- 7 days of Visit 8, and Visit 9 (Week 16/Day 112) should be within 
+I-7 days from the original or adjusted scheduled visit date. 
All study visits occurrin g after rando mization (Visit I. Week 0/Day 0) should be based on the 
Visit I study vis it date. or the adjusted visit schedule in the event of a delayed Visit 2 (Weck 
I/Day 7). During the 12-week random ization period, subsequent to Visit 2 (Week I /Day 7). if 
a study visit occurs no more than a maximum of 4 days outside of the visit window (± 7) the 
study drug can be admi nistered and the next visit scheduled in accorda nce with the original or 
adjusted visit calendar. If a late study visit should occur more than 4 days outside of the study 
visit window the study drug should not be administered and a protoco l deviation recorded. 
Under no circumstances should any 2 doses of study drug be administered within fewer than 7 
days of each other.

study after consultati on w ith the Spo nsor and should complete the Early Term ination visit. The 
Final Study Visit sho uld be conduc ted at least 6 weeks (+/-7 days) after the last study 
admini stration of study drug. The Final Study Visit is not required if the last admini stration of 
study drug occurred 6 or more w eeks prior to the Early Termination vis it. 
11.l ASSESSMENTS AT EAC H VISIT 
All subjects who sign an Informed Consent Form will be assigned a unique subject numb er. 
This numb er w ill be used for identification purposes for all study vis its. 
All s ubjects who sign an Inform ed Consent but do not e nter the study must have a reaso n 
recorded as to why randomization into the study did not occur. This informati on wi II be input 
into the Electronic Case Report form (eCRF). 
Retesting of screening evaluations is pe rmitt ed once for each test without prior approval from 
the Spon sor. Additi onal retesting may be permitt ed on a case by case basis after consultation 
with the study Spon sor. 
Rescre ening of sub j ects is permitt ed at the discretion of the Investigator.

NOTE: A 12-lead resting ECG will be obtained from all subjec ts at the time of 
scree ning. ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine for 
approx imately 5 minut es. Each 12-lead ECG will be evaluated by an 
approp riately qualified physician at the study site. ECG data will be evaluated 
using the fol lowing categor ies: 
• Normal 
• Abnorma l. not clinically significant 
• Abnonna l. clinica lly significant 
Any suspected cardiovascular AE should be followed with an additional ECG 
at the discretion of the Investigato r. 
• Collect stool sample for iVYLI SA GIP testing. 
• Collect blood and urine specime ns for clinical laboratory testing (see Appendi x B

part of the s ubject' s available existing medical record. 
• Collect blood for serum pregnancy test for FOC BP. 
• Begin assess ment of AEs. 
• Schedule subject l'or endoscopy procedure. 
Whe n the creen ing clinical laborato ry test results are received, they must be re iewed by the 
Invest igator or approp riate qualified dcsignee for clinica lly significant abno rmalities . 
lf no clinic ally significant abno rmaliti es or exclusions are found. the si te should proce ed with 
the scheduled endoscopy and biopsy (or proceed directly to the endoscopy and biopsy without 
having lab resul ts if requi red due to logistica l or c linical considerations). If clinically 
significa nt abnormalitie s are found. retesting of the subject shal I occur at the discretion of the 
Investigator or design ee physician. Retesting is perm itted one time for each laborato ry 
paramet er. Additional testing may be permitt ed after consu ltation with the Sponsor·s 
approp riate qualified dcsignee. If the clinically signi ficant abnormalit ies resolve, the subject 
can proceed with the scheduled endoscopy and biopsy.

13 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
13.J IMM UNOLOGICAL RESPONSE: ASSESSMENT OF ABERRANT 
INTRA£P ITHELIAL LYMPHOCYTES 
The primar y endpoint in this trial is the reduction in the % of aberranl intestinal IELs with 
respect to total I ELs as assessed by tlow-cytometry (Immunolog ical Response 1 ). The first 
secondary endpoint is Immun ologica l Response 2, the reduct ion in the% of aberrant intestinal 
I ELs w ith respect to intestinal epithel ial cells. a composite endpoint calculated by multipl ying 
the % of aberrant lEL vs total IELs (dete rmin ed by tlow cytometry) by the% of total !EL vs 
intestinal epithelial cells. as assessed by immunohistochemistry. The secondary endpo int could 
be more representative of a benefit driven by functi onal impact rather than simple reduction in 
I EL number s. 
Both endpoints address the core abnormal ity in RCD-11, an in situ sma ll bowel T cell 
lymphoma in which aberra nt lymphocytes are respons ible for mucosa I damage and sympt oms 
and for the progression to EA TL. Aberrant IE Ls are d escribed as surface CD3 -negative. 
intracellular CD3-posilive. The reduction in the proportion and number of aberran t 
lymphocytes is spec ific lo RCD- 11. is analogous to a reduction in tumor size in a solid tumor 
cance r. and has been propo sed as the most direct meas urement of efficacy in RCD- 11 (as 
reviewed in van Wanr ooij et nl. 2014). 
This exploratory study, first industry-sponsored trial in RCD-11. will be considered positive for 
the purposes of Go-No decision-making if at least one of the two calculations of 
Imm unological Response is found to be positive. 
Flow cytometry is the most accurate tool available to quantif y aberrant I ELs (van Wanr ooij el 
al. 2014), and it is preferred over IHC, (less sensitive) and TcR rearrang ement or clonality by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR , less specific) (van Wanrooij el al, 201 4 ). Enumerati on of 
total lELs will be done by JHC to calculate the secondary endpoint of% of aberrant IELs vs 
intestinal epithelial cells. Enumerati on of aberrant (intracellular CD3) and abno rmal (altered 
phenoty pe. such as overexpression of NKG2D) IELs by IHC and PCR will be performed as 
well, as exploratory endpoints. 
Protocol CELIM -RC D-002 
Version 3, 11-J L-20 16 
Page 63 or 134 Confidential 
Flow cytometry of IELs requires the acqu isition of fragment( s) of small bowel tissue by 
endoscopy and biopsy. and the method to disperse, stain and analy ze the IELs is described 
elsewhere (Leon. 2011 ). 
Flow cytomec ry is the clinical- grade technique employed and validated in the routine 
phen otyping of hemat ological cancer s such as leukemias and lymphomas. It is exqui sitely 
quantitative( > I 0.000 single cells are quant ified by laser beams per second based on multiple 
specific surface marker s) (Leo n 2011, van Wanroo ij et al. 2014). The large number of cells 
stained and analyzed. est imated to be betwe en 0.5 milli on and 5 million per time point per 
patient. ensures low variabi lity and reproducibilit y. All sites will use the same proced ure and 
experimental protocol. and technical validati on\ ill be pcrfonned prior to study start. 
13.2 HISTOLOC lC RESPONSE: SMALL BOWELL ENDOSCOPY , BIOP SY 
AND HISTOLOGY 
At each time point specified in Table I. sma ll-bowe l biops ies will be collected in order to 
perfonn the aberrant IEL analy sis and the histological assess ment of muco sa) inflamm ation. 
The latter will provide the secondary endp oint of Histological Response. as measured by 
improvement from baseline in small intestinal VH:CD ratio assess ed with a validated 
morphometric analysis (Taave la el al. 2013). Lack of Histological Response has been shown 
to corre late with long te rm outcomes includin g progre ssion to EATL (Nijeboe r el al, 2015 a. 
b). albeit the current Phase 2a study may be of insufficient dura1i on lo fully assess histological 
recovery (slower than immunologic resolution). In addition to the VI l:CD ratio. the second 
commonly used histological score. the Marsh-Oberhub er classification (Marsh, 1992. 
Oberhuber 2000) . as well as the total IEL count (all IEL. not just aberrant) will also be 
calcula1ed as a secondary endpoint. 
Al each time point spec ified in Table I. approxima tely eleven to thirteen ( 11-13) fragment s or 
specimens of small-b owel tissue will be taken from the second part of the duodenum distal to 
the ampulla by trans- oral upper endoscopy and forceps biopsy. Biopsies should be collected 
from the 0 2 segment of the duodenum. Ulcerative lesion s should be avoided. The location and 
macroscop ic appearance of the tissue will be noted in rhe source documents. The potential 
presence of an) obse rvable lesion uch as ulcerati ve jejuniti s will be captured in the eCRF. 
When nece ssary. sampl es will be re-oriented and sectioned again until they are of good quality. 
The proced ures will be described in a Study or Laboratory Manual or similar document, and 
the I EL/LPL prepa ration meth od wi II be based on published meth ods by the Paris site. The 
fragments or specimen s will be prioritized as follows: 
i. Fi rst five specim ens collected , for now cytometry: Approximate ly S biopsy 
specimen s will be used for tlow cytometry. done locally at each site with 
fresh tissue. 
11. Seco nd three spec imens collected, for histology and immun ohistochem istry: 
Approximately three (3) biopsy specime ns will be fixed in I 0% formalin or 
other fixative. with one ( I) of them used for standard pathology at the site 
and two (2) of them e mbedded in pararfin wax after orientati on for analysis

crypt depth (CD, in micrometer s) and their ratio. VH:CD ratio. Further. the 
Marsh-Obe rhuber sco re will be given (MO, M I, M2. M3a. M3b, or M3c) and 
the density of CD3-positive IE Ls (cells/I 00 epithelial cells) will be assessed. 
Histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC, e.g .. the determination or 
NKG2D on IEL) analysis will be performed following standard operating 
procedures for fixed biopsy spec imen orientation. paraffin embedding. 
cuttin g, staining and scanning for whole slide virtual microscopy. Standard 
operating procedures will also be followed for biopsy morphometry readin gs 
using validated meth ods (Taavela et al, 2013). If it is not feasible to measure 
at least 3 villus-crypt units for a subject's given biopsies. even after re-cutting. 
the results will be considered not evaluable. 
111. Three specimen s collected for experimental biomarkers: Approximate ly three 
(3) specimens will be used for biomarker research. Two fragments will be 
placed in mRNA preservative for future mRNA analysis and one will be used 
for TcR clonality (fres h, frozen or embedded in paraffin). 
1v. Optiona lly, two fragments for functional expe riments: Two spec imens. if 
available. may be used fresh in select sites for analysi s of I L-15 related 
functi onal biornarkers. Measurement of AMG 714 in the biopsies may be 
attempted. In Finland one or both optional specime ns wi 11 be used in some 
patien ts for crypt cell ·'mini-gut'· in vitro cullll re at baseline and post-
treatment to study bioma rkers of epithelial cell differentiation in the crypt-
villous axis. 
Every effort will be made to collect all 11 to 13 specime ns, but shou ld this number not be 
reached. the specimens wi 11 be allocated in the order indicated. 
13.3 CLINICAL RESPON SE: BRISTOL STOOL FORM SCALE (BSFS ) AND 
GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS RATING SCALE (GSRS) 
Clinical Respo nse, based on sympto ms record ed with patient reported outcome (PRO) 
questionnaires, will be considered secondary endpoints. 
13.3.1 B ristol Stool Form Test 
The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS. Append ix C) is a pictorial aid to help subject s identify 
the shape and cons istency of their bowel movement s during the s tudy (Riegler et al 200 I). 
Subject s will be asked to complet e this form daily using an electronic diary at the time of each 
bowel movement from randomization through the Final Study Visit (Visit 9; Week 16/Day 
I 12). If no bowel movements were exper ienced by the subjec t on any given day. the s ubject 
should document this using the electronic diary.

Version 3. 1 l-J U L-20 16 
Page 65 of 134 Confidential 
13.3.2 Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) 
The GSRS (Append ix D) is a 15-question 7 scale questionnaire used to assess five dimen sions 
or gastrointestinal syndrom es: diarrh ea. indigestion, constipation, abdominal pain and reflux 
( vedlund et al 1988). While not specific for celiac disea se. the GSRS is widely used in 
gastroenterology and has been used in several clinical trials of experimental medication s in 
celiac disease. thus becoming a very useful tool with abundant existing reforencc data (Kelly 
el al 2013: Uihdeaho et al. 2011: Leffler el al, 2015). 
Subjects will be asked to complet e this questionnaire week ly, using an electronic diary. from 
the day of randomization through the Final tudy Visit. 
The analy sis w ill include the full GSRS questionnaire as well as the subset of question s most 
closely related to celiac disease (termed "Celiac GSRS" or CeD-GSRs··) (Leffler el al. 2015). 
l 4 EXPLORATORY ASSESSMENTS 
14.1 PHARMA COKJN ETICS/P HARMA CODYNAM ICS 
Pharmacokinetic s of /\MG 71 4 in RCD-11 patient s will be charac terized us ing nonlinear 
mixed-effects modeling. includ ing evaluation of effects of major covariate s (weight or body 
mass index [BMI] and body surface area [BSA]. sex. biochemical parameters and disease 
characte ristics at basel ine) on AMG 7 1 4 exposu re. 
Exploratory exposure-response analysis will be performed for efficacy, safety. and biomarker 
measure s. 
The time and date of each PK sample must be carefully recorded and reported in the eCRFs, 
as well as the beginning and end or each investigational product infusi on. 
14.2 ASSESSMENT OF THE GLUTEN-FREE- DIET : JVYL ISA GIP STOOL 
TEST AND DIETITIAN CONSUL TATION 
In celiac disease, identification or gl uten contamination is essential for the management or the 
disease and for the succes sful conduct of clinica l trials. Contaminating gluten is a confounding 
factor in both diagnosis of RCD- 11 and in the evalua tion of a potential therapeut ic effect of any 
experimental medication. Histologic and clinical endpo ints are heavily influenced by the 
presence of gluten in the diet. 
In additi on to measuring symptoms through patient reported diaries , Celim mune plans to use 
the iVY LISA GI P-S gluten st ool tcsL a gluten assay developed to detect inadvertent gluten 
consumption by measurin g gluten immun ogenic peptides (GIP) in feces (Com ino el al. 2012). 
The iVYLISA GI P-S test has a CE mark and is commercially available in Europe from 
8 iomedal SL (as a research test) and. at the time of this writing. from LA BCO (as a laboratory-
developcd test). iVYLISA GIP-S measures GIP in stools by immunoa ssay. a sandwich ELISA 
with antibody G12. specilic for an immunodominant epitope of gluten that is resistant to 
degradati on in the intestine. The lower quantification limit of the assay is 0.16 µg of GI P/g of 
Protoco l CELIM-RCD-002 
Version 3. I t-JllL -2016 
Page 66 of 134 Confidentia l 
feces and the upper quantification limit is 5 µg GIP/g of feces. In unpubli shed results from 
Biome dal (De liac clinical trial; manu script submitted) , gluten in feces is highly corre lated with 
mucosa ! atroph y in celiac patient s on a purported GFD. The sensitivity and specificity have 
been 96.3 % and I 00%, respect ively, with positive and negative predi ctive values of I 00% and 
96.1 %, respective ly, in the aforeme ntioned celiac study. 
This assay will be used in the CELIM-R CD-002 trial to assist with data interpr etation by 
assess ing if the subjects are compliant with the GFD before enrollment and durin g the study. 
Non-complian ce informati on will aid under standing out liers and will be used in pre-spec ified 
subgrou p analyses . 
The test detects gluten for up to four days after consumpti on. and testing will be done every 
two weeks - subjects s ho uld provide a stool sample collected up to 3 days before, or after , the 
visit to the sites. in order to h ave a good probabilit y of identif ying dietary transgre ssors to 
enab le con-eel data interpretati on. Testing will be done at a central lab. Stoo ls may a lso be used 
for microbiome analysis. known lo affect gluten composition and the biology of IL-15. 
Tn additio n to the glu1en stool test, adherence to the GFD will be assessed periodically (Table 
I ) by an expert dietitian who will counsel the subject s. The dietitian will fill out a quest ionnaire, 
provided by the Spon sor, to document the conversation and any detected dietary 
tTansg ressions. This assessme nt can be conducted by phon e, provid ed it is conducted w ithin 
the allotted visit window. This informati on mc:ry be analyzed in an explorator y fashion. 
The questionna ire will address the followi ng items: 
• Did the subject have nutritiona l counseling with an expe r t dietitian during the visit? 
Yes/No 
• Was a dietary transgression de tected s ince the last visit? Yes/No 
• If Yes, please indicate the number of transgress ions since the last visit. 
Patients will be provided a calendar or similar tool Lo note their dietary transgressions 
between visits. 
14.3 PHYSICIAN GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE (PGA} AND 
PATIE NT GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE (PTGA)/RATING Of

The PtGA should be completed by the subject prior 1 0 study drug administration. 
14.4 Q UALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNA lRES : SF-12 V. 2 AND EQ-SD 
The SF-I 2v2 Health urvey is a sho rter ersion of the SF-36v2 Health Survey uses just 12 
questions to measu re functional health and well-being from the patien t·s point of view. 
The Sf--I 2v2 cove rs the same eight health doma ins as the SF-36v2 with one or two quest ions 
per domain (Ware. et al. 2009). 
The EQ-50 is a simple. brief and standardized instrument for use as a measure of health 
outcome (http://www.euroqol.o rg/abo ut-eq-5d. html). The SL version, available since 2009. 
will be used in the study. 
14.5 BIOMARK ERS OF DISEASE ACTIVITY 
Seve ral biomarkers of disease activity will be analyzed in serum (e.g., CRP. IL-15. s1 L- 1 5R ), 
as exploratory indicator s of disease activity and potential predict ors of respon se to AMG 714. 
Flow cytometry will be perfonned with fresh whole blood and with intestinal mucosal cells 
(I EL and /amino proprio cells). Blood flow cytom etry may be conducted on isolated pe.riphcral 
blood mononuc lear cells and/or directly in whole blood. Flow cytometry will be used to 
Jescribc rhe phenotype of bl ood (includ ing NK cells) and intestinal cells. including marke rs 
relevant to the enumeration (e.g., C03. CDI03) and function (e.g .. NKG2 0 ) of aberrant IELs. 
lmmunohi stochemistry (IHC) will be performed in biopsy tissue to assess marke rs on IELs 
(e.g., NKG2 D) and epithelial cells. 
Biomarkcr s of I L-15 biology may also be analyzed in fresh biopsies. if available at sites with 
the relevanr experimental capabilities. 
Jn addit ion, other exploratory biomarkers may be analyzed at a later time in stored samp les. 
including serum (for proteins. RNA). blood cell pellet (for future bioma rkers using gene 
expression profiling and possibly lymph oma mutatio nal analysis), biopsy fragments (for 
mRNA. protein. and possib ly lymph oma mutati onal analysis), stool (glute n. microbi omc). 
urine (gluten. metabo lites). Future bi omarker analysis will solely be for the purpose of celiac 
disease or AMO 714 resea rch and will be reported separate ly and not in the clinical study 
report. The sample retention timelin es will be described in the infonned consent.

The DNA sampl e for HLA testing at screening, in subjects without pre-existing available HLA 
typing infonnati on, will be used solely for that purpo se and will be destroyed after the result 
is obtained. 
Blood samples for bioma rkers must be obtained PRIOR to study drug admin istration at each 
time point listed in the schedule of events (Tab le I). The time and date of sampling must be 
carefull y recorded and reported in the eCRFs. 
Select safety biomarkers will be evaluated as well as exploratory indicators of possible clinical 
efficacy, such as BMT (derived from the weight measures at every visit), serum albumin 
(patient with albumin being provided exogenously will be excluded from this analysis), 
hemog lobin, hemat ocrit. 
14.6. IMM UNOGEN IClTY 
A two tiered immunogenicity testing approach will be used in order to determine if a sample 
contain s ADAs. Samples will be initiall y tested in an immun oassay (ELISA). Sample s that test 
positive for binding antibodies will then be tested in a bioassay (CTLL -2 cell line that responds 
to recombinant human IL-15). to de tect neutralizing antibodies (NAb). 
The sensitivity of the ELISA assay is approximately 20 ng/mL and the lower limit of reliable 
detection (LLRD), even in the prese nce of serum level s of drug, is approximate ly 250 ng/mL. 
The LLRD of the bioassay is approx imate ly 1.5 µg/mL. 
In addit ion to these existing validated methods. the spons or will develop and validate a 
bridging immun oassay (for bindin g AD A) and a target binding method (for neutralizin g AD A) 
in the Mesa cale Discove ry (MSD ) platform to potentially improve performance. The final 
method chosen will be desc ribed in the study manual and regulatory submissio ns 
14.7 CELIAC DISEASE PATIENT REPO RTED OUTCOME (CED PRO) 
Subjects will be asked to maincain a daily e-dia ry for the CeD PRO instrum ent (Appendix K) 
at times indicated on the Schedu le of Events (Table I). This questionnaire was developed to 
assess symptom severity in clinical trials in subjects with celiac disease. 
Items in the questionnair e were formulated based on one-on-on e interviews with patient s with 
celiac disease, thus they reflect the symptoms that patient s consider part of their celiac disease 
expe rience. The questionna ire is designed as a self-admini stered daily diary. to be completed 
at the same time each day, and requires less than I 0 minute s to complete. It includes 9-itcms 
asking participants about the seve rity of eeliac disease symptoms they may experienc e each 
day. Participants are asked to rate their symptom severity on an 11 -point, 0 to I 0 scale; from 
··not experienc ing the symptom· ' to ·'the worst possible symptom experience ··. Symptoms 
include abdominal cramp ing. abdominal pain. bloating . gas. diarrh ea. loose stool. nausea. 
headache and tiredness.

Placebo clinical supply will be provided in glass vials as a frozen. clear. colorless. sterile 
protein-free solution. Sufficient volume will be provi ded to match the active drug volume to 
preserve the blind . The vials are intended for single-dose use only. 
18.3 DOSE RATIONALE 
The selection of d osing level for the CELIM-R CD-002 study is based on a d esire to s trike the 
appropriate bene fit/risk balance. striving for efficac y by t esting an adequat ely high dose of 
AMG 714 in an at1empt to quickly alleviate the presumed effeccs of IL-15 on abe rrant I ELs 
and on RCD-11 symptoms whil e using a d ose that is similar to d oses used in prior studies with 
tolerability comparable to placebo. The highest clinical dose of AMG 714 used chronicall y IV 
has been 8 mg/kg IV single d ose followed by 4 mg/kg IV q2w for 8 w eeks. The prop osed dose 
of 8 mg/kg IV for l 0 weeks . q2w w ith an extra dose at week l. is mod estly higher in order to 
account for the presumed protein-losing enteropathy typical of RCD- 11 (up to 40% protein loss 
can be expected based on albumin levels in RCD-11 patients) and for the larger targe t organ 
area (small bO\vel as compared to more localized joints). 
Whil e exposure data at rel evant IV doses are only available in healthy volunteers, the high 
bioava ilabilit y L)f 86.6% obs erved in health y volunlccrs and the expec ted protein- losing 
enteropath y in RCD-11 suggest Lhal it is unlik ely RCD -11 patients will present with 
meaningfully higher exposures than those srudied in healthy volunteers. 
Human studies to date. as well as modeling. support the dosing regimen of an IV infusion of 8 
mg/kg AMG 71 4 a total or 7 times over I 0 weeks, over 1 20 minut es. The highest doses of 
AMG 7 1 4 studied in clinical trials are a s ingle C d ose of 700 mg. SC doses of 300 mg every 
two weeks for 1 2 week s, and the aforementi oned 8 mg/kg IV single d ose followed by 4 mg/kg 
q2w for 8 weeks. all regimen s with no safety s ignal s identified to date. In additi on. the 
ro osed stud regimen has ade uate safet margins based on t oxicolog . 
The expected ranges p rovided by the dosing regimen are not only presumed to be tolerable. 
but also expected to be e fficacious based on available mechanistic data. Whil e there is no 
clinical experience with AMG 714 in RCD-11 nor any understandin g of the potential PK/PD 
relationships in this disease. incubation of duodenal biopsies from RCD- 11 patients with l 0 
µg/mL of A MG 71 4 for 48 hours effectivel y inhib ited endogenous at:tiva tion or JAK3 and 
T /\TS (Malamut el al. 20 I 0). Serum concentrati ons in this study are predicted to alwa ys 
excee d 59 µ g/mL. and following a dose at I week to excee d 96 µg/mL, even after ac countin g 
for possible leakage of p rotein in the intestin e. Even if lm:al mucosa I tissue levels were lower

than serum levels. these serum values are several limes higher than the I 0 µg/111 L 
concentrati ons th at were effec tive in the ex-vivo setting, and provide a reaso nable expectation 
that the tissue levels achieved will be efficacious. 
Scrum expos ure will be monitored with frequent PK sampling and w ith an unblind ed interim 
analysis to be conducted by the DSMB. when the tenth patient reaches Weck 4. Tissue effec ts 
will be monito red with experimental biomark ers to be m easured in the biopsies to be obtained 
in the study. 
18.4 BLINDING 
This is a double-blind. placebo-controlled study. To ma intain blindin g, an assigned unblin ded 
study staff memb er wi 11 be required to receive and prepare the study drug at each site. Due ro 
the difference in appearance betwee n active study drug and placebo. o nly the unblinded study 
staff membe r shou ld prepare the study m edication for dosing. 
18.5 UNBLIND lNG 
If there is a n eed to unblind a subject's treatment assignment for emer gency medical 
manage ment, the Investigator w ill contact the Medical Monitor. The Med ical Monitor, in 
consultation with Sponsor. will make a decision to u nblind. If the decision has been made to 
unblind, a pro mpt written or electronic notification will be provi ded to the Investigato r. 
If reporting of an AE is to be per formed unblind ed as per any r egulatory authority's guide lines, 
study-unrelated Spon sor per sonnel will unblind the individu al subject' s treatment group and 
will perform the unblind ed repo rting. No tr eatment group information would be shared with 
blind ed study per sonnel. 
18.6 RANDOMIZAT ION AND TREATMENT ASS IGNMENT 
Subjects will be randomized at a 2: I allocation ratio to r eceive AMG 714 8 mg/kg or placebo 
a total of 7 times over I 0 weeks. The randomization wi II not be stratified as type II RCD is 
rare and the number of s ubjects in the study is sma ll. For dosing times see the study Schedule

18.7.3 P reparat ion a nd Ad m inistration 
The unblinded study staff member respon sible for receiving and prepar ing the study 
medication must obtain the treatme nt assignme nt via the EDC system a minimum of 24 hours 
prior to the scheduled rando mization visit (Visit I: Week O /Day 0). This will allow for proper 
thawing and preparation of the study drug. Each subsequent visit should be documented in the 
EDC system in order to assure proper drug accountability. 
On the day before investigational product administration. AMG 714 must thaw overn ight at 2 
to 8° C. Vials must continue to be protected from light during the thawing process. Once 
thawed. vials should be transferred to room temperature and gently swirled to ensu re mixing. 
Avoid vigoro us shaking or vortex ing. Mixing may result in the formation of small bubbles. 
\.vhich is normal. Preparation of the clinical supplies should be performed using aseptic 
techniques. under sterile cond itions. Prolonged exposure to light should be avoided.

2 J ADVE RSE EVENTS AND SERIO US ADVERSE EVENTS 
21.1 REPORT ING RES PONS IBILITY 
The I nvestigator and study staff are responsib le for detecting and recording AEs and SA Es. 
durin g scheduled s afety evaluations and whenever such infomrntion is brought to their 
anentinn. This section of the protocol provides defin itions and detailed procedure to be 
followed. 
Durin g each visit, the Investigator or qualified designee will assess adverse events using an 
open question that does not to influence the subject's answe rs. e.g .. "have you noticed any 
chan ge in your healthT 
A II A Es occurrin g after signing of' the lnfonn ed Consent. and at or before the final visit must 
be reported regard less of suspected relationship to study drug . 
All AEs will be evaluated by the Investigator and inten sity (severity) and relation ships to st udy 
drug will be assesse d and recorded. 
Any A Es already document ed at a previo us assess ment and designated as on going. should be 
reviewed at s ubsequent visits as necessary. If these have resolved. the resoluti on date should 
be d ocumented. Changes in intensity or frequency of AEs should be recorded as separate 
events (i.e .. a new record started). 
A Es and SA Es in possible subject s travel ing to s tudy sites from countries other than the study 
site country will be assessed and managed in the same fashio n as those appearin g in subjects 
from the study site countries. 
21.2 DEF INITION OF AN AE 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrenc e (e.g .. sign. symptom. disease. syndrome. 
intercurrent illness) that occurs in a study subject, following the signing of informed conse nt. 
regardless of the susp ected cause. Only subjects who have been exposed to s tudy drug (active 
drug or placebo) can exper ience treatme nt emergent AEs. Untoward experiences occurring 
prior to initiation of first administration of s tudy drug are considered non-treatment emergen t 
A Es. 
21.3 SEVERITY 
The term of severity is u sed to describe the intensity or a specific event. The event itself. 
howeve r. may be of minor medical significan ce. This is not the same as serious. which is based 
Protocol CELIM-RCD-002 
Version 3, I l-JUL-2016 
P:1ge 78 of 134 Confiden1ial 
on outcome of the event. Seriousness. not intensity. serves as a g uide for definin g regulat ory 
reportin g obligations. 
For all A Es, sever ity will be recorded in the source documents and repo rted on the appropriate 
AE eCRF page. There are 3 level s of severity, defined as follows: 
Mild: Noticeable. but does not disrupt normal daily activity 
Moderate: Su fficient to re duce or disturb normal daily activity 
Severe: Incapacitating. significantl y interferes with or prevents nonnal daily activity 
21.4 RELAT IONSHIP 
for all AEs. re lationship to study drug will be reco rded in the source documents and repo rted 
on the appropriate AE eCRF page. The Investigator must judge w hether the study drug caused 
or contributed to the A E, and report it as either: 
or Relat ed (definitel y, possibly or probably): when there is a rea sonable possibilit y 
that the study drug caused or contributed to the AE; this conclusion m ay be 
supported by the followin g ob servations, though these are not required for a 
determination of related: 
a) There is a plausibl e time sequence between onset of the AE and study drug 
administration: 
b) There is a plausible biological mechanism through w hich study drug may 
have caused or contributed lo the AE: 
Not related: when it is highl y unlikely or impossible that the study drug c aused 
or contributed to the AE; this conclusion may be suppo11ed by the following 
observations. though these are not required for a dete rmin ation of not related: 
a) Another cause of the A E is evident and most plausibl e; 
b) The temporal sequ ence is inconsistent between the on et of the AE and 
study drug admini stration; 
c) A causal relation ship is considered biolo gically implau sible.

• it was fatal (i.e .. the AE caused or led to death) 
• it was life threatening (i.e .. the AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death; an 
AE that hypo thetically might have caused death if it were more severe is not an SAE 
by this criterion) 
• it required or prolonge d hospitali zation (i .e .. the AE resulted in a minimum 24 hour 
hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyo nd the expecte d length of stay; 
hospital admis sions for elect ive medical/surgical proced ures. or scheduled treatments 
are not SAEs by this criteri on) 
• it resulted in permane nt or sig nificant disability/incapac ity (i.e .. the AE resulted in a 
substantial disrupt ion of the subject" s abi I ity to carry out normal Ii fe functi ons) 
• it resulted in a congenital anomaly /birth defec t (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or 
fetus of a subject expose d lo the study drug prior to concept ion or during pregna ncy) 
• it required significant medical or surgical interventi on to prevent permanent 
impairment or damage (e.g., hypotension requiring pressers to prevent ischemia. 
replacement of broken or malfunctioning device). 
21.6 SPEC IAL REPORTIN G SITUATIONS 
21.6 .1 Death 
Death is an outcome or an event. The AE that resulted in the death should be recorded and 
reported as the SAE. If an autopsy is performed. efforts should be made lo obtain the results. 
21.6.2 Hospitalizations for Surgica l or Diagno stic Procedures 
The AE leading lo the surgical or diagnostic procedure s hould be recorded and reported as the 
SAE . The procedure should be report ed as an action in response to or treatment for the medical 
conditi on. 
21.6.3 Pregnanc y 
Any pregnanc y that occu rs during the study or within 6 monrh s of the last dose of study drug 
should be recorded on a Pregnancy Repo 11 Fonn lo facilitate outcome follow-up. Pregna ncy 
should be reported whether occurrin g in a fema le subject or the partner of a male subject. 
Spontaneo us abortion shou Id be reported as an SI\ E. 
Regardle ss of subject sex. the Investigator sho uld counsel the subjec t (and partner. if 
appropri ate) regarding possible effect s on the fetus and risks of continuin g with the pregnancy. 
Monitorin g sho uld continue until conc lusion of the pregnancy.

21.6.4 Inadvertent Exposure or Overdose 
Any inadvettent exposure or overdose of study medication should be recorded in the source 
documents and reported immediately to the Sponsor by phone and email. The expos ure and 
any A Es should be reported of the appropriate eCRF forms. 
21.6.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) 
SUSA Rs shall be reported by the Sponsor to the regulatory authorities as applicable and to the 
relevant ethics committee to fulfill EU regulati ons ("Detai led guidan ce on the collection, 
verificati on and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on 
medicinal products for human use"). 
Expedi ted reporting is required electroni cally to the regulatory author ity and Eudra Vigilance 
database as soon as possible, however no later than within seven (7) days of the Sponsor being 
ihformed of fatal or life-threatening adverse reaction. 
Serious unexpected adverse reactions which are not life-threatening or fatal must be reported 
to the regulatory autho rity and EudraYigilan ce database as soon as possible and in any case 
within fifteen ( 15) days of the sponsor first being inform ed. 
Once a year, the Sponsor shall provide a list of all suspected serious adverse reactions which 
have occu rred during the period in question (Ann ual Safety Report) to regulatory authotities 
as applicable or requii·ed. 
21.7 PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse events occu rring after the subject has sign ed informed consent wi II be reported in the 
source documents and recorded on the approp riate AE eCRF pages. 
It is not necessary to comp lete an AE eCRF page for chron ic medical conditions present at 
enrollm ent that remain stable during the trial. However. if a medical cond ition present at 
enrollment worsens in in tensity or frequency, it should be reported as an A E. It is not necessary 
to comp lete an AE eCRF for fluctuat ions in the disease under study if: these fluctuations are 
adeq uatel y captured by the efficacy assessments, and the degree of variation in frequency or 
severity is typical of the disease under study . An AE eCRF must be comp leted if the disease 
course is atypical or there is development of new signs or symptoms related to the d isease 
under study . 
Investigators should obse rve the follow ing guide lines when record ing AEs on the AE eCRF 
pages: use recognized medical tem1s: do not u se jargon, colloquiali sms or abbreviations; record 
a diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome ) rather than compone nt signs and symptoms (e.g., 
migraine rather than headach e, nausea, transient visua l loss); if a diagnosis is not feasible, 
record component signs and symptoms; AEs occu rring seconda ry to other even ts (e.g., 
sequela e) should be identified by the primary cause.

22.1 SAMP LE SIZE DETERM INATION 
The CELIM-R CD-00 2 study is an exploratory proof-of-concept (POC) study of an 
experimental medication , AMG 714. in RCD-JJ patient s. While it will be the first such s tudy 
spon sored by a pharmaceutical compan y, the straightforward design is based on several 
academic studie s (Goe rres et al, 2003: Brar et al, 2007: Tack et al. 2011 a, 20 I I b) as well as 
on the nonclini cal proof-of-principle signal obtained with AMG 714 in intestinal explant s from 
patients with RCD-11 (Malamut et al. 20 I 0). 
The sample size is based on the size or previ ous acade mic studies. Pub I ished prosp ective 
academi c srudies have ranged from 13 to 18 patients total (Tac k et al. 20 I I a. 2011 b) and 
CELIM-RCD-00 2 will be the largest prospective trial ever cond ucted in RCD- 11, a very rare 
malignant disea se. 
The sample size of approxima tely 24 subjects ( 16 subjects in AMG 714 arm and 8 subjects in 
placeb o urm) has been calcu lated to achieve at least -80% power to det ect a 20 percentage 
point diffe rence in the primar y endpoi nt. the difference in the baseline -to-Week 12 reductio n 
of% aberrant IELs vs total IELs between the AMG 714 arm and placebo arm. 
This sample size calculation was based on the follow ing assump tions: 
• Two-sided type one error rate a = 0.1 
• Power 1-P = 0.8 
• Analysis method: one-way ANOVA by SAS® (proc power) 
• 2: l allocation ratio between the AMG 714 and placeb o arms 
• Common D = 17.4 for the baseline to Week 12 reducti on in% aberrant I ELs 
as assesse d by low-cytome try 
• Mean chang e of 20 percent age point s and 0 percentage points in the baseline 
to Week 1 2 reduc tion in % aberrant I ELs in the AMG 714 and placebo arms. 
respec tively 
• No drop- outs account ed (effo11s will be made to replace drop-outs befor e 
Week 6 and/or su~jects who do not provide the seco nd biopsy) 
The standard deviation used for the sample size calculation is computed from the% aberra nt 
I EL (obtained by now cytometry) data from 13 subjects treated with cladribin e (subset of the 
patients reported in Tack et a I, 20 l I).

received one dose of investigational product) and the per prot ocol population (PP. efficacy. 
i.e., avai !able and evaluable pre-and post-biop sy informati on). 
PP Population: The PP population will exclude non-evaluable subjects and subjects with major 
protocol deviatjons thou ght lo impac t the ability to assess the effec t of treatme nt. Exclusion 
of subjects from the PP set will be reviewed. documented and approved before the study is 
unblind ed to the study Sponsor. The criteria for excluding su bjects from the PP populat ion wil I 
be speci fied in the SAP. 
ITT (Safety) Populati on: This populati on consists of all randomized subjects who have 
received at least one dose of the study drug. Subjects will be analyzed in the treatment group 
they were rand omized to. Subjects with only one measure ment availabl e will be excl uded from 
the ITT population for all endpoint s defin ed as change from baseline. The safety populati on is 
by definiti on t he same as the ITT populati on. 
Main efficacy measures which re quire pre- and post-treatment biopsies will be based on the 
PP populat ion (at least 2 biopsies, the seco nd at least on Week 6 or later). Cont inuous variables 
will be an alyzed based on the ITr popu lation . Dem ograph ics and safety parameters will be 
analyzed using the ITT population . 
22.3 MJSSING DATA 
Subjects withdra wing from study drug admi nistration before Week 6 will be excluded from 
the PP analys is and the seco nd biopsy will not be collected. Subjects withdra w ing o n o r after 
Week 6 will be included and the second biopsy will be collected. Missing data after Week 6 
will be imputed and the imputation rules will be descr ibed in the SAP. 
No other data imputa tion will be done. 
22.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
22.4.J Subject Dispo sition 
The number of subjects rand omized. completed, or discont inued from the study and the reason 
for study discontinuation w ill be tabulated by treatment group as appropriat e. Subject count by 
analysis popu lation will be tabulated.

APPENDIX F. INTERPR ETATlON OF HEPATITIS RESULTS 
Subjects must underg o screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV). At a minimum , this include s 
testing for HBsAg (HBV surface antigen) , anti-HBs (HBV surface antib ody), and anti- I IBc 
total (HBV core antibody total): 
• Subje cts who test negative for all HBV screening t ests (ie, HBsAg-, anti- HBc-, and 
anti-HBs) are eligibl e for this study. 
• Subjects who test positive for surface antigen (HBsAg + ) are not e ligibl e for this study. 
regardless of the results of other hepatitis B tests. 
• Subjects who test negati ve for surface antigen (1 IBsAg-) and test p ositive for core 
ancibody (anti- HBc+) and surface antibody (anti-HBs+) are eligib le for this study unless 
local guidelin es require additional testing. 
• Subjects who test positive only for surface antibody (anti- HBs+ ) are eligibl e for this 
study unless local guidelines require additional testing. 
• ubjects who test positiv e only for core antibody (anti-HB c+ ) must undergo further 
testing for hepat itis B deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA test). If the HBV DNA test is 
positive , the subject is not eligible for this study. If the HBV DNA test is negative , the 
subjec t is eligible for this study. In the event the H B V DNA test cannot be performed, th e 
subject is 1101 eligibl e for this study.

APP ENDIX G. PREDICT ED EXPOSURE AND SAFETY MARGIN S 
Table 4 shows predictions of expos ure and safety margins calculated for proposed 8 mg/kg IV 
q2w dosing with an additional dose at Week I. 
Two sets of assumptions were used: a) that AMG 714 PK in RCD-1 1 patients is the same as in 
healthy subjects. and b) that AMG 714 clearance is higher in RCD- 11 patients due to protein 
leakage in the intestine, and that the exte nt of the leakage is reflected in the serum albumin 
values. 
The data used in the calculations are described in Table 4. Calculations are described be low 
the tables.

To help people say how good or bad a health state is, we 
have drawn a scale (rather like a thermometer) on which 
the best state you can imagine is marked 100 and the

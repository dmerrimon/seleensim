3. Precis  
 
3.1 Objective  
To evaluate the effects of lower ing the dietary nutrient linoleic acid (LA) as a controlled variable on: 1) 
tissue accretion of omega -6 and omega -3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA); 2) bioactive 
endocannabinoids derived from the omega -6 HUFA arachidonic acid (AA); 3) insulin sensitivity; 4) 
satiety  and hunger ; and 5) body composition . Modifications in dietary LA will be offset with reciprocal 
changes in the nutrient oleic acid (OA) to maintain equivalency of calories and nutrients.  
 
3.2 Study Population  
Up to 1 80 overweight, but otherwise healthy pre -meno pausal women volunteers (aged  18 through 50) 
with body mass ind ex (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m2, will be enrolled .   
With the anticipated dropout rates described in Section 7.4, we anticipate that 84 of these subjects will be 
randomized to study diets, and 64 subjects will complete th e 12 week diet phase.  
 
3.3.1 Three  Group Comparative Analysis  
A total of 84 subjects will be randomized to one of 3 healthy and nutritionally complete diets that differ 
only in the fatty acid com position of added visible oils. All foods will be provided t hrough the NIH 
metabolic kitchen, with subjects visiting the kitchen daily Monday through Fr iday to obtain foods.  Each 
Friday, subjects will carry home foods packed for their weekend meals .  Baseline testing battery will 
include: 1) blood composition of omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA; 2) endocannabinoid, eicosanoid, and 
docosanoid derivatives of omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA ; 3) insulin function assessment; 4) body 
composition assessment; 4) functional satiety asses sment; and 5) s elf-reported measures of  satiety,  hunger 
and affective states. The full baseline testing battery will be repeated after 84 days of randomized 
treatment . An abbreviated testing battery will be performed after 28 and 56 days of randomized treatment.   
A subset o f participants  will undergo additional inpatient testing as described in Section 3.3.2.  The 
remaining subjects will remain ambulatory throughout the study. Participants will be advised to continue 
their usual medical care and medications throughout the study.  
 
3.3.2  36-week Continuation Sub Study  
At completion of the 84 day (12 week) study, participants in the low LA group (Group B) will have the 
option of continuing their study diets for another 252 days (36 weeks).  Continuing subjects will  consume 
the same low LA ( 1 en%) diet .  During the continuation phase, t he abbreviated testing battery will be 
completed after 6, 12, 18, 24 and  30 weeks , and the full testing battery will be repeated after 36 weeks.  
 
3.4 Outcome Measures  
3.4A Primary Dependent Variables  
The prima ry outcomes will be the proportion of omega -6 HUFA in total HUFA (%omega -6 in HUFA) 
and two endocannabinoids derived from omega -6 AA, 2 -Arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) and N-
Arachidonoylethanolamine (Anandamide or AEA) . 
 
3.4B Secondary Dependent Variables  
Secondary outcome me asures will include blood concentrations of the omega -6 HUFA Arachidonic Acid 
(AA); the omega -3 HUFA Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and DHA; the rates of change in %omega -6 in 
HUFA, AA, EPA , DHA, 2 -AG and AEA over time; adipose and muscle tissue fatty acid composition; 
endocrine hormones; gene expression profiles; psychometrics; functional satiety; 24-hr energy 
metabolism and substrate utilization; and body composition, as follows.  Omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA

page 6 of 68 and total fat content will be mea sured in adipose and muscle tissue biopsies. Other endocannabinoid, 
eicosanoid and docosanoid derivatives of omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA will be measured in plasma via 
mass spectrometry.  
Psychometric outcomes will include self -reported measures of satiety an d affective states. Functional satiety will 
be assessed via buffet -style food array testing. Body composition outcomes will include DEXA, 3T MRI, 
anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance. Genotyping will also be performed to assess for 
interactions between selected gene v ariants and effects of the intervention.  
 
 
4. Introduction/ Scientific Rationale    
 
4.1 Role of endocannabinoids in craving and satiety  
Numerous crucial regulatory activities have been attributed to endocannabinoids, and their contribution to 
a host of seemingly unrelated chronic conditions is a matter of intense inquiry (1, 2) . The 
endocannabinoid system includes the two endogenous ligand s 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) and  N-
arachidonoylethanolamine (Anadamide or AEA)  and two cannabinoid receptors (CB -1 and CB -2). CB -1 
receptors are located primarily in the brain, but also in the GI tract, adrenal glands, liver, adipose tissue, 
and skeleta l muscle (3). Excessive activity of the endocannabinoid system has recently emerged as having 
a central role in promoting obesity through at least three organ systems (4, 5) . 1) Centrally, excessive 2 -
AG stimulates the CB -1 receptor, which increases hunger -induced increas es in food intake, and decrease 
in satiety. 2) In liver, CB -1 stimulation increases de novo hepatic lipogenesis through activation of the 
fatty acid biosy nthetic pathway. 3) In adipose  tissue, CB -1 expression has been implicated in the cont rol 
of adiponectin secretion and lipoprotein lipase activity.  
 
Amid growing evidence that endocannabinoid signaling is up -regulated in obesity, pharmaceutical 
companies began developing CB -1 receptor antagonists. In 2006, the European Medicines Agency 
approved rimonabant, a CB -1 receptor inverse agonist, following impressive clinical trial results in both 
obese and diabetic patients. Specifically, placebo -controlled trials demonstrated considerable weight -loss 
(nearly 15 lbs), and significant improvements in: 1) waist circumference; 2) HDL -cholesterol; 3) 
triglycerides; 4) inflammatory markers; 5) blood pressure; 6) fasting glucose; and 7) fasting insulin (6, 7) . 
In 2008, however, rimonabant was pulled from the market due to serious psychiatric side effects , 
including suicide (8). Because full pharmacological blockade of the CB -1 receptor is effective in treating 
obesity and related metabolic derangements, a safer alternative to pharmaceuticals for diminishing 
endocannabinoid hyperactivity may have widesprea d beneficial public health implications related to 
obesity and metabolic syndrome.  Given the fact that endocannabinoid s have important physiological 
functions, partial CB -1 receptor blockade may be preferable to full inhibition.  
 
In a similar manner to fo od, endocannabinoid hyperactivity has been linked to impairment of satiety 
responses for alcohol (4, 9)  and other substances of abuse (10). Impairment of satiety responses may be 
due to the shared downstream effects on signaling pathways (cAMP/PKA) regulat ed by CB -1 receptors 
and D2 dopamine receptors in the ventral tegmental area and striatum (11, 12) . Thus, we posit that 
excessive endocannabinoid activity, and the ensuing neuroadaptations in the brain reward system, 
manifest phenotypically as deficits in satiety regulation for foods and substances of abuse, hepatic 
steatosis and excessive adipose accumulation. In this study we will not assess substances of abuse but will 
assess satiety for foods, and relevant metabolic changes.  
 
4.2 HUFA as precursors to endocannabinoids  
Endocannabinoids are not stored in cellular vesicles but rather are formed enzymatically from membrane 
phosopholipid -fatty acid precursors on demand (13). The two best characterized endocannabinoids, 2 -AG 
and AEA, are  both metabolic derivatives  of a single fatty acid precursor, omega -6 arachidonic acid (AA).

page 7 of 68 Because humans cannot synthesize AA de novo  (14), tissue phospholipid concentrations of AA (PL -AA) 
are dependent upon dietary intake of: 1) omega -6 AA (15); 2) the  precursor to AA –linoleic acid (LA) 
(16); and 3) competing fatty acids such as omega -3 EPA and DHA (14, 15, 17) . Therefore, by restricting 
dietary omega -6 fatty acids and/or boosting intake of competing omega -3 fatty acids, humans may be able 
to reduce PL -AA content, subsequent endocannabinoid synthesis from PL -AA, and the metabolic 
consequences of high 2 -AG and AEA levels.    
 
To test this hypothesis, we asked if selectively raising one omega -6 fatty acid in the rodent diet (while 
keeping total fat composi tion constant) would result in endocannabinoid hyperactivity and excess 
adiposity.  We first asked whether the selective increase of linoleic acid (LA), from 1 % of energy (en%) 
to 8 en%, could elevate PL -AA in membranes and in turn also elevate endocannab inoid levels in liver and 
brain.  To test if the proportion of PL-AA precursor pool was the critical variable, we also added 1 en% of 
energy as EPA and DHA to the 8 en% LA diet.  
 
Results  
Increasing dietary LA from 1 en% to 8 en% increased PL -AA (by 59% ) and doubled liver 2 -AG in the 
medium fat diet (see Table 1).  C onversely, the addition of 1 en % as EPA and DHA to the 8 en% LA diet 
decreased PL -AA and  halved liver 2 -AG, indicating that regulation of the PL-AA in the phospholipid 
pool is a critical determinant for endocannabinoid production. A similar pattern was seen in the high fat 
diet. A comparable pattern of adverse effects of 8 en% LA was observed for feeding efficiency (defined 
as weight gained per kca l of food consumption), leptin levels, adiponectin levels (inverse pattern) and 
increased adipos ity (see Fig.  1, differing letters indicate stat istical differences at p< 0.05)

In addition to raising PL -AA, the 8 en % LA diet reciprocally decreased both EPA ( by 85%) and DHA  (by 
39%) in liver phospholipids compared to their 1 en% LA counterparts.  Because PL -EPA and PL -DHA 
act as rival substrates with  PL-AA for enzymatic conversion to omega -6 (or omega -3) endocannabino id 
derivatives  (18), these deficits in omega -3 EPA and DHA exacerbate omega -6 endocannabinoid 
hyperactivity.  
 
Our results agree in principle with landmark rodent studies conducted nearly 50 years ago, which clearly 
demonstrated that tissue PL -AA concentrations increase progressively as dietary omega -6 LA increases 
up to 5 en%. In their classic 1963 study, Moh rhauer and Holman showed that when dietary LA ranged 
from 0 to 4.87 en% for 100 days, the accumulation of PL -AA in liver lipids ranged from 1.8 to 14.7% by 
weight (19). Similar robust variability in tissue omega -6 PL-AA conte nt was seen in brain tissue (20) and 
erythrocytes (21) when dietary LA ranged between 0 and 5 en%. (See Fig. 2). However, further increases 
in dietary LA above 5 en% had comparatively minor effe cts on tissue PL -AA content (22), presumably 
because AA accumulation has already ‘plateaued ’.

4.3 Translation from rats to humans  
 
Do these principles apply to humans?  
Like rodents, humans lack the enzymatic machinery to  synthesize AA de novo . Thus , human tissue 
concentrations of PL -AA and other omega -6 HUFA are dependent upon dietary consumpt ion of AA; its 
precursor –LA; and omega -3 acids that compete with omega -6 acids for enzymatic elongation, 
desaturation, acyl ation, and incorporation into human tissue phospholipids (17).  Competition continues 
as ome ga-6 and omega -3 HUFA act as rival substrates for enzymatic cleavage and conversion into 
omega -6 and omega -3 endocanna binoids. Therefore, as in rodent s, the red uction of dietary LA is a 
plausible strategy for decreasing  tissue PL -AA and its endocannabinoid  derivatives in human  tissues .   
 
Pilot data from th e combined analysis of the first 20 participants in a randomized dietary trial testing the 
effects of a 12-week reduction of dietary LA, found that AA declined significantly, and EPA+DHA 
increased signifi cantly , with or without added EPA+DHA  (Table 2) .  These data indicate  that 12 weeks is 
sufficie nt to detect significant changes in AA, EPA, and DHA .  However, dynamic equilibrium in 
erythrocyte fatty acids was not reached between weeks 8 and 12 weeks.

The release of omega -6 and omega -3 fatty acids from adipose tissue stores is expected to prolong the time 
to necessary to reach dynamic equilibrium in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids.  Because adipose 
tissue fatty acids have an estimated half -life of 300 to 600 days (23-25), interventions substantially longer 
than our 12 -week (84 day) diet phase are expected to produce even more substantial metabolic and 
clinical effects. Therefore, a substantially longer dietary trial is likely to be necessary to atta in maximal 
metabolic effects, and to provide new knowledge about the potential confounding role of omega -6 and 
omega -3 fatty acids in adipose tissue stores.  In conjunction with the preceding 84 day diet phase, subjects 
who complete the continuation phase will maintain study diets for 336 days, which will allow adequate 
time to assess the potential confounding role from the release of adipose tissue omega -6 and omega -3 
fatty acids.  The 36 -week (252 day) duration of the continuation phase was therefore sele cted as a 
reasonable compromise between: 1) the desire to assess the confounding role of adipose stores of omega -
6 and omega -3 fatty acids, and 2) the practicality of keeping volunteers on study diets for prolonged 
periods.  
 
In conjunction with the plausib le biological mechanisms  described above , our rodent data and human 
pilot data provide proof of principle for our hypothesis that lowering dietary LA will raise tissue PL -EPA 
and PL -DHA, lower tissue PL -AA, attenuate excessive omega -6 endocannabinoid activity , enhance 
satiety and diminish excessive craving for pleasurable stimuli such as food or substances of abuse.  The 
critical knowledge gap, and the logical next step, is to test our hypothesis in randomized controlled trial in 
humans.  
 
 
 
 
5. Study objectives and hypotheses   
 
5.1 Study objective  
To evaluate the effects of modifying the dietary nutrient LA via controlled substitution for oleic acid 
(OA)  on the blood omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA composition; endocannabinoids and other lipid 
mediators deriv ed from omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA; and the rates of change in the omega -6 and omega -
3 HUFA and their metabolic derivatives over time.  We will also evaluate the  effects of modifying dietary 
LA on insulin sensitivity ; hunger and satiety; and body composition.

page 11 of 68 5.2.1A Primary aim s  
To evaluate the effects of modifying the dietary nutrient LA on the %omega -6 in HUFA ; as well as two 
endocannabinoids derived from omega -6 PL -AA, 2 -AG and AEA.  
 
5.2.1B Primary hypothese s 
Lowering dietary intake of LA as a controlled variable from  8% to 1% of daily food energy  will 
significantly decrease the %omega -6 in HUFA and the endocannabinoid derivatives of omega -6 AA, 2-
AG and  AEA.  
 
5.2.2A Secondary aims  
To assess  the effects of modifying the dietary nutrient LA  on the rates of cha nge in omega -6 and omega -3 
HUFA, 2 -AG, and AEA over time; adipose and muscle tissue fatty acid content,  relevant metabolic 
mediators  measured in plasma , body composition, functional satiety, and psychometrics, as follows.   
Metabolic ou tcomes will include  other endocannabinoids, eicosanoids and docosanoids derived from omega -6 
and omega -3 HUFA, 24 -hr energy metabolism, and endocrine hormones related to obesity .  
Adipose and muscle tis sue outcomes will include tissue concentrations of omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA. Body 
composition outcome s will include DEXA, 3T MRI, a nthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance .  
Functional satiety will be assessed via (buffet -style) food array testing.  
Psychometric outcomes will include s elf-reported measures of hunger , satiety, and affective states.  Genotyping 
will also be performed to assess for interactions between selected g ene variants and effects of the intervention.   
 
5.2.2B Secondary hypotheses  
Lowering dietary intake of LA as a controlled variable from  8 en% to 1 en%  will result in:  
• Increased omega -3 HUFA and reduced omega -6 HUFA in muscle and adipose tissue biopsies  
• Reduced total fat content of adipose and muscle tissue biopsies  
• Reciprocal increases in accretion of the omega -3 HUFA and their endocannabinoid, eicosanoid, 
and docosanoid derivatives.  
• Favorable effects on insulin sensitivity and  endocrine hormone functio n. 
• Favorable effects on gene expression profiles.  
• Favorable effects on hunger , satiety, and affective states.  
• Increased functional satiety.  
• Reduced adiposity and increased lean body mass.

7.1 Study overview  and design  
This randomized  controlled, 3-arm dietary trial aims to assess the rate and extent of changes in the 
composition of omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA and their metabolic derivatives in response to marked 
dietary changes in the nutrient omega -6 LA, in ambulatory overweight premenopausal women. The main 
trial is divide d into two phases: 1) a 4 week ‘baseline phase’, and 2) a 12 week ‘diet phase’. There is also 
an optional 36 week ‘continuation phase ’ for participants receiving diet “B” , as discussed below.  During 
the baseline phase, prior to randomization, eligible sub jects will complete 7 -day food records. Those who 
are compliant with the food records  and meet other eligibility criteria  will undergo a baseline testing 
battery that includes: 1) blood parameters; 2) muscle and adipose tissue biopsies; 3) body composition  
assessment; 4) functional satiety assessment; and 5) psychometric testing. Participants will then be 
randomized to one of 3 healthy and nutritionally complete diets  with equivalent macronutrient 
composition  differ ing only in fatty acid content .  
After randomization, participants will receive all foods through the NIH Metabolic Kit chen for the 
duration of the 12 -week diet phase (i.e. meal replacement) . During the first 4 weeks, the iso -caloric 
‘weight maintenance’ phase, participants will be provid ed with the same amounts of  daily food calories as 
they consumed during the 7 -day record collection .  During the following 8 week ‘ad libitum’ phase (from 
4 to 12 weeks), participants will receive the same diets but will be allowed to eat as many servings  of 
study foods as they desire.  After completion of the 12 week diet phase , the full testing battery will be 
repeated.   
 
At completion of the 12 week diet phase , a subset of participants ( those receiving diet ‘B’ ) will have the 
option of continuing their study diets for  an additional  36 weeks.  During this ‘continuation phase’, the 
diets will be identical to their preceding diets. After 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 weeks of the continuation phase , 
subjects will participate in follow -up testing ses sions.  At compl etion of the 36 -week continuation phase , 
the complete baseline testing battery will be repeated.  
Participants will remain ambulatory throughout the study. Subjects will visit the NIH Metabolic Kitchen 
daily Monday through Friday to obtain foods, and will b e advised to continue their usual medical care and 
medications throughout the study.  
 
7.2 Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited through the NIH Normal Volunteer Office, by word of mouth and through local 
advertisement (IRB approved flyers, newsletters, websites).    
 
7.3 Screening Methods  
 
7.3.1 Pre -screening  
The NIH Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison Office will receive inquiries from interested study 
subjects .  Pre -screening by this office will exclude patients who cannot regularly attend the NIH 
Metabolic Unit to acquire study foods, and those with significant claustrophobia that will preclude the 
imaging tests that are required to participate in the full protocol . All others will be contacted by the 
protocol team to review exclusion criteria. Eligi ble subjects will be invited to Clinical Research Center for 
a screening visit.  
 
7.3.2 Screening visit  (Baseline Phase Visit 1)  
Patients will be invited to come to the OP-9 (Outpatient 9) Multiple Medical Specialties Clin ic to obtain 
informed consent by a member of the investigative team. A limited physical exam with current weight 
and evaluation of venous access will be performed.  A thorough medication history will be obtained with 
special attention given to drugs that may confound the interpretation of m etabolic testing such as 
psychotropic agents, antiretroviral agents, sympathomimetic amines or beta blockers. An

page 14 of 68 electrocardiogram and baseline blood work (electrolytes, chronic liver disease work -up, renal function, 
vitamins, thyroid function, HgbA1C , HIV  test), a serum pregnancy test and a urine test to screen for illicit 
drugs will be obtained. Instructions for completing detailed 7 -day food records will be given to 
participants by a member of the Nutrition Dept staff.  
 
7.4 Study Design   
We anticipate that 84 subjects will need to complete the baseline phase and be randomized, with an 
anticipated dropout of about 20 subjects during the diet phase, in order for 64 subjects to complete the 12 -
week diet phase. Based on previous NIH Clinical C enter dietary protocols with a similar baseline phase, 
we anticipate that 30 to 55% of enrolled subjects will not complete the baseline phase due to lack of 
attendance, non -compliance with 7 -day food records, and/or discovery of an underlying exclusionary 
condition during the baseline phase history, physical examination or laboratory testing . Therefore, up 
to180 subjects will be enrolled in the baseline phase so that a sufficient number of subjects (64) will 
complete the diet phase.  
  
After completing the baseline  phase, 84 subjects will be randomized  to 1 of 3 diets (Table 3), to be 
maintained for 12 consecutive weeks. We anticipate that about 20% of subjects will dropout during the 
diet phase. Therefore 64 subjects are expected to complete the diet phase.

7.5 Study Procedure s   
The main study lasts 16 weeks  and is divided into 2 phases: 1) a 4 week ‘baseline phase’ , and 2) a 12 
week ‘diet phase’.  There is also an optional 36 week ‘continuation phase’ for participants receiving diet 
“B”.   
 
During the 4 week baseline phase participants will visit the NIH outpatient clinics  three times  as shown in 
Table 3 below . Visit 1 is a screening visit lasting about 1 hour.  During Visit 2 laboratory tests will be 
reviewed, and participants will fill out questionnaires, which will take about 2 hours.  At Visit 3, 
participants will receive a bout 6 hours of testing and will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study diets.  
 
During the 12 week diet phase participants will eat only the study foods that are supplied  by the NIH 
metabolic kitchen.  They will visit the NIH outpatient metabolic unit every morning for breakfast 
(Monday -Friday) for all 12 weeks of the diet phase.  Each of these 60 visits will last about 20 minutes, for 
a total of 20 hours.  They will fill out the C omprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale-Self-Affective  
(CPRS) questionnaire (see Section 7.6.6) after breakfast once every 2 weeks, which takes about 10

page 15 of 68 minutes to complete.  Once every 4 weeks after breakfast, on Diet Day 28 and 56, they will have 
additional testing for about 1.5 hours; on Diet Day 84 they will have additional testing for about 6 hours 
as shown in Table 4 below . During the optional 9 month (36 week) continuation phase participants 
continue to eat only the study foods suppl ied by the metabolic kitchen.  They will continue to visit the 
NIH outpatient metabolic unit every morning for breakfast (Monday -Friday) for all 36 weeks of the 
continuation phase.  Each of these 180 visits will last about 20 minutes, for a total of 60 hou rs.  
Participants will fill out the CPRS questionnaire after breakfast once every 2 weeks, which requires about 
10 minutes to complete.  Once every 6 weeks after breakfast, participants will undergo additional testing 
for 3 to 6 hours as shown in Table 5 below.   
 
All study procedures are for research purposes only.  
 
 
Baseline Phase  
The sequence of procedures in the baseline phase is given in Table 4.  All time -points are targets, and 
may be adjusted based on practical considerations.

page 16 of 68 Participants will return for an outpatient visit about 7 to 14 days  after the 2nd Visit. If their weight is 
stable, participants will have additio nal tests, which will require about 6 hours (Testing procedures are 
listed  in Tab le 4).  
Participants will receive a schedule for the remaining study visits and tests.  Participants will then be 
randomized to 1 of 3 diets as described in Section 7.6.2 .  
 
Study Diets  
The 3 study diets differ only in the amounts of fatty acids that they contain, as described in Sections 8.2.  
The diets are designed by NIH Clinical center dietitians to be nutritionally complete.  All foods will be 
provided by the NIH metabolic kitchen. Participants are required to visit the NIH Clinical Center each 
morning, Monday through Friday, to eat breakfast and to pick up study foods, and to return uneaten food 
to the kitchen. Participants are also asked to keep a daily log of food and bev erage intake.  
 
We will strive for 100% adherence to study diets and daily visit schedules, but recognize based on 
previous experience and reviews of literature that this may not be practical or achievable in an ambulatory 
setting for this length of time.  Therefore, to maximize adherence participants are provided with a day of 
emergency meals to eat during missed days whenever possible. They will also receive group -specific 
food-based guidance from the nutrition team designed to mimic their diet group  if they are unable to pick 
up study diets for more than one day . Subjects will record/report any non -study foods or beverages 
throughout the study and this will be analyzed as part of the study diet.  Finally, we will measure 
adherence to study diets using two  proxies: (1) the LA content of circulating plasma measured at baseline 
and 4, 8, and 12 weeks of diet exposure; and (2) the number of days they did not pick up study meals. In a 
posthoc/exploratory manner, we will test for effect modification of the diet effects based on adherence. If 
effect modification is evident, we will present the results of the adherent subgroup as a posthoc analysis.  
Diet Phase  
The sequence of procedures in the Diet Phase is given in Table 5.  All time -points are targets, and may be 
adjusted based on practical considerations.  
 
Table 5: Procedures during the Diet Phase  
Diet Phase Testing Visits (12 week phase, Diet Days 1 -84) 
 
 
During the 12  week  diet phase participants will visit the NIH outpatient metabolic unit every morning for 
breakfast (Monday -Friday).  Each of these 60 meal visits will last about 20 minutes, for a total of 60 
hours.  Participants will complete the CPRS questionnaire after b reakfast once every 2 weeks, which 
takes about 10 minutes to complete.

testing session lasting about 1.5 hours (Testing procedures are listed  in Table 5).  Twelve  weeks after 
beginning the diet phase  (Day 84) , participants will have testing that lasts about 6  hours.  They will have a 
shorter 2 hour testing session 4 and 8 weeks after beginning the diet phase.   
  
Optional Continuation Phase  
Those participants who were assigned to either diet “A” or diet “C” will have completed their 
participation after the 12 -week diet phase of the study. Those who were assigned to diet “B” will be given 
the option of continuing a study diet for an additional  9 months (36 weeks).  
 
The sequence of procedures in the Continuation Phase is given in Table 6.  All time -points are targets, 
and may be adjusted based on practical considerations.

During the 36 -week continuation phase, participants will continue to receive the study diet “B” that they 
received in the 12 week diet phase  as shown in Appendix 1: Study Design Flow Diagram.  
As in the main diet phase, participants will continue to visit the NIH outpatient metabolic unit every 
morning for about 20 minutes for break fast (Monday -Friday). Each of these 180 visits will last about 20 
minutes, for a total of 60 hours. Participants will fill out the CPRS questionnaire for about 10 minutes 
after breakfast once every 2 weeks.  
 
On 5 separate occasions after breakfast, at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 weeks into the continuation phase, 
participants will have a testing session lasting about 1.5 hours.  At 36 weeks into the continuation phase 
participants will have a testing session lasting about 6 hours (Testing procedures are listed  in Table 6 ).

developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN .  
 
7.6.2 Randomization and Masking  
At completion of the pre -intervention phase, participants will be randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups by 
computer.  This process eliminates experimenter bias in group assignment. The computer program uses a random 
numbers generator and is programmed to ensure appropriate numbers of subjects in each arm of the study within a 
permuted variable block size of 3 -4 patients.  The computer program generates a treatment assignment associated 
with each eligible subject’s name and study ID number and documents these in an uneditable form with a date 
stamp. The research dietitian will have password -protected access to the computer -generated treatment 
assignments.  The dietitian will use this information to assign each participant to one of the 3 treatment arms, 
which will be designated by a letter and color (e.g. Diet A: Orange).  Because the 3 diets differ only in the fatty 
acid content of added visible oils, which are clear and can be distinguished only by nutritional analysis, the 
participants will remain blind ed to their treatment.  The research dietitian, by necessity, needs to know which 
group the patient is assigned in order to provide appropriate foods. No other research or clinical investigators will 
be told which arm the participants have been assigned.   
 
7.6.3 Specimen collection for biomarker testing  
 
Blood Collection   
To assess the blood compositions of omega -6 and omega -3 fatty acids and their metabolic derivatives, 
fasting venous blood will  be collected at 4 timepoints in the main study (Baseline Vis it 3; Diet Phase 
Visits 1, 2 and 3 ).  Blood will be collected from participants in the optional continuation phase at 6 
additional time points (see Table 5: Continuation Phase Visits).  Blood will be immediately processed and 
stored at -80 degrees C. See T able in Appendix 2 for a list of fatty acids and their metabolic mediators 
that will be assessed.    
 
Genotyping  
This project will collect DNA samples from the saliva of well phenotyped overweight  subjects for genotyping.  
Genotyping will be performed on al l study participants. Single gene mutations/polymorphisms of interest include: 
1) those involved in fatty acid metabolism; 2) those implicated in the pathogenesis  of obesity; 3) those implicated 
in the pathogenesis of medical and psychiatric conditions ass ociated with obesity; 4) those linked to certain 
behavioral characteristics relevant to obesity and obesity -related comorbidities. On the consent form, participants 
can designate whether or not the DNA samples can also be stored  for future research project s. 
 
Muscle and adipose tissue biopsies and tissue procurement  and post -biopsy pain assessment  
Fat and muscle biopsies will be obtained before and after the dietary interventions, by the study 
physicians and/or nurse practitioner.  In accordance with established NIDDK practices, biopsies will be 
performed on the Metabolic Unit or the adjacent 5SW day hospital, as described below.  
Subcutaneous adipose tissue (3 -5 g) will be removed from the abdominal region by aspiration with a 16 -
gauge needle under local anesthesia (e.g. 2% xylocaine).  
Muscle biopsies (100 -250 mg) will be obtained under local anesthesia from the vastus lateralis , as 
follows. The patient will be prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The muscle biopsy procedure invol ves 
numbing a nickel -sized portion of the skin of the thigh with a local anesthetic and making a small 
incision, approximately 1/4 inch. The biopsy needle is then inserted via the incision through adipose 
tissue and muscle fascia into the muscle.  A small sample of muscle tissue is removed.   The incision will 
then be closed with steri -strips and covered with a dressing.   If the muscle is too deep to be reach, the 
muscle biopsy will not be attempted.

page 19 of 68 The biopsy tissue specimens will be separated into two al iquots for muscle and three aliquots for adipose tissue 
for assessment of fatty acid composition and other biochemical assays, frozen in dry ice and stored at -80ºC for 
future studies.   
Post-biopsy pain will be evaluated using the standard Clinical Center  Numeric Rating Scale (Score range 0 -10) 
before and after the biopsy, and twice daily (upon awakening and at lunch time) for 3 additional days.  
 
 
7.6.4 Insulin Sensitivity  
Homeostasis Model of Assessment – Insulin Resistance (HOMA -IR)  
To assess insulin sensitivity, fasting blood glucose and insulin will be collected at each testing visit, for 
calculation of the HOMA -IR, a validated biomarker for estimating insulin sensitivity.  
 
 
 
7.6.5 Functional Satiety assessment  
Ad-libitum Buffet Meal  
Participants will be fed a standard breakfast meal containing 15% of energy needs (calculated using the 
Mifflin St. Joer equation with an activity factor of 1.5).  Between the breakfast and buffet meal 
participants will be asked to fill out Visual Analogue  Scales asking questions about hunger and satiety at 
30-60 minute intervals.  Six hours following the standard breakfast the patient will be placed in a food 
laboratory and presented with a buffet meal.  They will be instructed to “eat until they are full. ”  The 
buffet meal will contain foods that will be weighed pre and post consumption in a metabolic kitchen so 
that the precise amounts of foods consumed can be calculated.  
 
Buffet Meal Screening  
Food Preference Questionnaire :   
At screening patients will f ill out a 50 item food preference questionnaire with buffet items embedded 
within it.  If the patient reports dislike of > 50% of the food items on the buffet, they will be excluded 
from participation.  
 
7.6.6 Psychometric assessments  
Questionnaires to Eval uate Eating Behavior and Satiety   
WALI - Weight and Lifestyle Inventory:   This is a comprehensive questionnaire encompassing the subject’s weight 
and health history.   It includes sections on self -reported eating and physical activity patterns.  Eating dis orders 
such as binge eating, night eating syndrome and other abnormal eating patterns can be evaluated with this 
assessment.  Estimated completion time is 60 -90 minutes.  
 
Three Factor Eating Questionnaire:  An instrument developed by Stunkard and Messick t o measure dietary 
restraint, disinhibition and hunger.  Consists of 51 questions related to these 3 factors of human eating behavior.  
Estimated completion time is 20 -30 minutes.  
 
Questionnaires to Evaluate Mood   
POMS - Profile of Mood States:  The POMS assessment provides a rapid, economical method of assessing 
transient, fluctuating active mood states.   The POMS can be readministered as frequently as every week.   The 
scale contains 65 items, which subjects rate on the Likert scale (0 to 4).  A summation of scores for tension, 
depression, anxiety, fatigue, and confusion are subtracted from the vigor score to yield an overall description of 
subject’s mood state.  Estimated completion time is 10 -15 minutes.  
 
FS- Flourishing Scale:  This scale consi sts of 8 questions related to subject’s feelings about their personal 
accomplishments in life.  Subjects rate each item on a numerical scale.  High scores represent people who feel

page 20 of 68 they are leading thriving, resourceful and capable lives, and thus is a mea sure of positive affect.  Estimated 
completion time  is 5-15 minutes.  
 
PANAS - Positive and Negative Affect Schedule:  This assessment is a self -rated affect scale which distills 
emotionally descriptive words into either positive or negative mood valences. T he subject gives a numerical 
rating to each emotionally descriptive word given in the list of words.   Positive and Negative affectivity are 
constructed by summing the ratings for these words.  The test can be repeatedly administered with valid results; 
even within a single day.  Estimated completion time is 10 -15 minutes.  
 
CPRS -S-A- Comprehensive Pyschopathological Rating Scale -Self-Affective:  Contains 19 questions condensed 
and rephrased from the full CPRS for self -implementation to quickly assess the su bject’s mood and anxiety level.  
It can be repeatedly administered , up to every three days.  It will be administered weekly in this study .  Estimated 
completion time 5 -15 minutes.  
 
 
7.6.7 Body Composition  
Anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance  
Height, weight, and circumferences will be obtained using standardized procedures. Bioelectric impedance 
spectroscopy (BIS, Xitron 4200, Xitron Technologies, San Diego, CA ) testing will be used to assess fluid status 
(ECW, ICW, TBW).  Subjects ar e measured while lying supine on a nonconductive surface.   Bioelectric 
resistance and reactance values a re measured after induction of  electrical signals with a maximum current of 800 
µA at multiple frequencies.    
 
Dual Energy X -ray Absor ptiometry (DEXA) s can  
DEXA (iDXA, GE Medicalsystems, Madison WI) will be used to measure body composition. This technique has 
found extensive clinical and research applications in addition to the assessment of bone mineralization status. 
With this technique, one can determ ine total and regional body fat and fat -free masses and can estimate 
appendicular muscle. DEXA produces photons at two different energy levels, 40 and 70 KeV. The photons pass 
through tissues and attenuate at rates related to elemental composition. Bone mi neral, with highly attenuating 
calcium and phosphorous, is readily distinguished from soft tissues. The different elemental profiles of fat and 
bone -mineral free lean allows for the analysis of soft tissue fat content, so that bone mineral, fat, and bone m ineral 
fat-free lean components may be resolved.  The D EXA has a slight radiation associated ( an effective dose of 
about 1 mrem total exposure to the tissue/scan, approximately equal to one day of background exposure).    Half-
body scans may need to be performed for  subjects that extend beyond the scanning area  (26, 27) . 
 
Assessment of visceral, liver and cardiac adipose (3T MRI)  
Overweight and obesity are associated with fat accumulation in the abdominal cavity (visceral  fat) and 
other important sites such as the liver (28, 29)  and muscle, referred to collectively as “ectopic fat”  (30). 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to quantify triglyceride content in the abdominal cavity,  liver 
and heart .  Two techniques will be employed to measure ectopic fat: proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) (29) 
and multi -echo imaging using the 3.0 T magnet  (31).   
 
7.6.8 Assessment of Dietary Adherence  
Adherence to study diets will be assessed via multiple methods.  The fatty acid compositions of all study 
foods will be determined and all study foods that are dispensed to study subjects will be recorded.  
Participants will be asked to return any foods they do not eat. They will be instructed to record any 
consumption of outside foods in a food log, including the specific food type (name brand if possible) and 
serving size.  M issed breakfast and food pick -up visits will be recorded.  In addition, blood concentration 
of LA will be measured every 4 weeks during the diet p hase, and every 6 weeks during the continuation 
phase.

7.6.9 Follow -up/ termination procedures  
There is no required follow -up for this study after completion of the experimental protocol. Participants will be 
advised to continue receiving their usual med ical care throughout the duration of the study.  With patient consent, 
clinically -relevant information obtained through participation in the protocol may be shared with participants and 
appropriate health care providers.   
 
7.6.10 Radiation exposure  
DEXA s cans will be performed solely for research p urposes.  Please see sections 8.7 and 8.9  for risks.  
 
7.6.11 Medications and devices requiring IND/IDE  
No medications or devices requiring IND/IDE will be used in this study.  
 
7.6.1 2 Storage of research samples a nd data  
Since many potentially important markers and genes relevant to obesity and related comorbidities are unknown at 
the present time, all research samples including DNA will be coded for storage in refrigerators and freezers in a 
locked laboratory. Ret ention of codes to identify the sources of research samples is necessary to perform 
correlations between genotype and phenotype, and between dietary intervention and outcomes.  The plan is to 
store the samples until they are analyzed.  These samples will b e stored indefinitely.  The IRB will be notified in 
the event these samples are accidentally destroyed, lost or are anonymized.   Tissue banking of DNA and tissue 
specimens will only include participants who specifically provide consent for future studies.  
Some clinically relevant research data will be stored indefinitely in the medical record and will be accessible to 
the patient for review by others of their choosing (doctors, insurance companies etc.) after executing a release of 
information.  The valida ted psychometric instruments used in this protocol have been converted to an electronic 
web-based secure data entry platform administered by the NIAAA.  .  The security of the data management system 
f is curated by the NIAAA in agreement with NIH data security policies .  Most data generated in this study will 
be stored and maintained in the NIAAA clinical database , which is password protected and secure.   
 
 
Use of research samples and data  
Currently, the research use of samples  is outlined in the protocol. Stored materials will be used for future 
evaluation of metabolic mediators derived from fatty acids, as well as metabolic mediators implicated in obesity 
and related medical and psychiatric comorbidi ties as the field evolves.   
 
Collaborations on stored tissue and blood samples  
Any collaborations requiring transfer of patient material will be done in a coded fashion after informing the IRB 
and obtaining necessary assurances from the outside instituti on.  The protocol will be amended and IRB approval 
will be sought when such collaborations are established.     
 
 
 
8 Risks and Discomforts   
8.1 Procedures with No Medical Risk and Minimal Discomfort  
The history and physical exam, body measurements, bioelectrical impedance, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram, buffet meal test, and questionnaires to evaluate eating history and quality of life have 
no medical risk and minimal discomfort.  
 
8.2 Study Diets

Protocol number : 11-AA-0028  Version :  9.1  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.1 -17-08)    
   
page 22 of 68 We will provide healthy and nutritionally complete di ets to all intervention groups. The diets will differ in 
their fatty acid composition. In general, there is minimal risk associated with adverse events as fatty acids 
in edible form are GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by federal regulatory agencies.   
 
The controlled  dietary variable to be changed in this study is linoleic acid  (LA), a common nutrient in 
foods. The minimal dietary requirement for LA  to prevent signs and symptoms of deficiency, as reviewed 
and developed by William EM Lands, PhD  is betwee n 0.05% and 0.50 % of energy  (see Figure below, 
available at http://efaeducation.nih.gov/sig/dri.html ). Furthermore, several modern populations consume 
less than 1 % of energy from LA with no apparent ill -effects  (32). The American  Heart Association 
recently advis ed that it is safe to consume “at least 5 to 10% of energy” from LA (33). In our study diets, 
LA in takes will range from 1.0 % to 8.0 % of energy. At these ranges, there  is little concern for risk as 
they are well above the  minimal dietary requirement  and in ranges that are commonly consumed by 
modern humans .   
 Dietary Reference Intak e (DRI) for L A 
 
Some published articles with information related to these fou r categories are listed below.  
EAR -Unwanted dermal signs were present in 100% infants receiving 0.04 % energy as linoleate, but in 
only 40% infants receiving 0.07 % energy as linoleate and n ot in any receiving 1.3 %. The EAR may be 
near 0.06 % of energy  (34); RDA -Thousands of healthy infants were raised with diets containing omega -
6 as 0.4 to 0.9 % energy, and calculation showed that probably less than 0.5 % energy was needed to 
prevent deficiency symptoms in infants. This level may meet requirements for 97% to 98% of infants  (35, 
36); AI- Although not rigorously determined, intakes from 1 % to 3 % of daily energy as omega -6 seem 
adequate  (37); UL-Excessive omega -6 eicosanoid actions and thrombotic deaths seem less frequent with 
balanced omega -3/omega -6 intakes  (38). Quintiles of dietary intake of  LA-in the USA have the 
following means: 2.9; 4.4; 5.5; 6.9; 10.3 en%  (39).  
 
A subset of participants will also receive 1 to 2 grams of omega -3 EPA and DHA from fatty fish. There is 
a theoretical increase in bleeding times with omega -3 fatty acid intake.  However, human supplement 
trials, including trials with considerably higher doses of omega -3 fatty acids, have not found increased 
bleeding risk  (40, 41) , with or without concurrent use of antithrombotic medications. We will use doses 
from foods that well within the usual daily intakes of populations with regular fish intake, such as Japan 

PI name : Christopher E. Ramsden , MD   Date:  01/03/2018

page 23 of 68 and Iceland (42, 43) . Therefore, there is little concern f or increased risk due to increased omega -3 fatty 
acid intake.   
 
It is possible that participants could have an allergic response to study foods.  During the screening visit, 
participants will provide information on known dietary allergens and the diets will be adapted 
accordingly, or if necessary the participants will be excluded.   Participants will also be advised to alert 
the research staff as soon as possible if they experience symptoms such as rash, hives, wheezing, or other 
signs of food allergy.  
With any change in dietary intake there is potential for  gastrointe stina l distress in human subjects. 
Subjects will be  asked to report  signs of distress . Participants will be advised to use  appropriate 
medications and/or di gestive aids (H2 blockers, bean -o, etc) as necessary .  
This study also requires daily workday visit s to NIH for 12 weeks.  It requires that participants only eat 
the food we provide. They may find these requirements inconvenient or burdensome.  They may not like 
the study foods.  Each of the study diets is nutritionally complete so it is unlikely that eating the diet will 
compromise health.  
8.3 Specimen Collection for biomarker testing  
Blood Collection  
Participants may have some discomfort and bruising at the site of needle entry.  There is a very small risk 
of fainting.  Infection in the area of the needle  insertion is rare.  
The amount of blood drawn from participants shall not exceed the specified limit of 550 ml (or 10.5 
mL/kg) for any 8 -week period for adult volunteers, provided in “ Guidelines for Limits of Blood Drawn for 
Research Purposes in the Clinic al Center” (M95 -9 (rev.) 5 June 2009).  
Since participants will have BMI between 25 -35, the limit of 550 mL per 8 -week period will apply.  
During the main study, which includes the baseline phase and 12 -week diet phase, we will draw no more 
than 1 cup of blo od (1 cup = 8 fl oz = 235 mL) for research purposes at any one time and no more than 3 
cups during the entire main study.  We will draw no more than 2 cups (470 mL) of blood during any 8 -
week period.  
For participants in the optional 36 -week continuation p hase, we will draw no more than 3 additional cups 
of blood for research purposes, and no more than 1.5 cups (353 mL) during any 8 -week period.   
 
Genetic Testing  
The genetic testing that will be done as part of this study is done for research purposes only.  It will not 
provide any information about participants’ health or ancestry. It is our policy to not provide the results of 
such genetic testing.   
 
 
 
8.4 Muscle and adipose tissue biopsies and tissue procurement  
The major risks/discomforts include pa in, bruising, infection, and scarring. The procedures will be 
performed under sterile technique to minimize the chances of infection. Local anesthetic will be used to 
minimize pain.  Ice will be applied to the site immediately after the procedure to limit bruising, swelling 
and tenderness. After subcutaneous tissue biopsy, patients will be monitored by a nurse. Post -biopsy the 
incision site will be cleaned and closed with adhesive wound closures and covered with gauze and 
translucent dressing tape. Study pa rticipants will be instructed to report to the clinical staff any changes at

page 24 of 68 the biopsy site including bleeding, secretion, erythema, pain, and signs and symptoms of infection. Study 
participants will be instructed to self -monitor the incision site after d ischarge from the Clinical Center.   
 
8.5 Questionnaires to Assess Mood  
Some subjects may find the questions or tests boring or frustrating.  They may feel uncomfortable discussing their 
mood and personality with the study staff.  They will be instructed to answer the questions as well as and as 
honestly as they can.  There are no direct physical risks associated with these tests .  It is possible that important 
information may be revealed about the subject that in some cases may ben efit from medical intervention.  In this 
case, the patient will be advised to share this information with their doctor for follow -up.  Furthermore, with the 
patient’s consent, results from these tests will be forwarded to their physician of choice for foll ow-up.   
 
8.6 Body Composition  
Dual Energy X -ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) SCAN  
DEXA will be used to measure body composition using x -rays to non -invasively assess skeletal and soft 
tissue density.  The procedure involves low -level radiation exposure.  The expected exposure for a scan is 
(0.001 rem)  or the equivalent of less than one day’s exposure to natural background radiation.   For more 
information see Radiation in Section 8 .9. 
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessment of visceral, liver and cardiac fat  
People are at risk for injury from the MRI magnet if they have pacemakers o r other electrical devices, 
brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), 
metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent 
eyeliner, implante d delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments.  Welders and metalworkers are also at risk for 
injury because of possible small metal fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware.  Subjects will 
be screened for these conditions before having any scan, and if any are found, the subject will not receive 
an MRI scan.    It is not known if MRI is completely safe for a developing fetus. Therefore, all women of 
childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed no more than 24 hours before each MRI scan. 
The scan will not be done if the pregnancy test is positive.  
People with fear of confined spaces may become anxious during an MRI. Those with back problems may 
have back pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner.  The noise from the scanner is loud enough to 
damage hearing , especially in people who already have h earing loss. Everyone having a research MRI 
scan will be fitted with hearing protection. Subjects will be asked to complete an MRI screening form for 
each MRI scan.   
 
8.7 Radiation from DEXA Scans  
This research study involves exposure to radiation from th e 4 DEXA scans in the main study and 3 
additional DEXA scans in the optional continuation phase. This radiation exposure is not  required for 
medical care and is for research purposes only.  The amount of radiation the subject will receive in the 
main study  is 0.004 rem, and in continuation phase is an additional 0.003 rem, which are below the 
guideline of 5 rem per year allowed for research subjects by the NIH Radiation Safety Committee. The 
average person in the United States receives a radiation exposure of 0.3 rem per year from natural 
sources, such as the sun, outer space, and the earth’s air and soil.  If a subject would like more 
information about radiation a copy of the pamphlet An Introduction to Radiation for NIH Research 
Subjects  will be provided.  
 
While there is no direct evidence that the amount of exposure from participating in this study is harmful, 
there is indirect evidence it may not be completely safe.  There may be a very slight increase in the risk of 
cancer.

page 25 of 68 Participants will be instruc ted to tell the doctor if they have had any radiation exposure in the past year, 
either from other research studies or from medical tests or care, so the research staff can make sure that 
the subject will not receive too much radiation.  Radiation exposure  includes x -rays taken in radiology 
departments, cardiac catheterization, and fluoroscopy as well as nuclear medicine scans in which 
radioactive materials were injected into the body.   
 
If a subject is pregnant or breast feeding, she may not participate i n this research study. It is best to avoid 
radiation exposure to unborn or nursing children since they are more sensitive to radiation than adults.  
 
 
 
9 Subject Monitoring, adverse event grading and withdrawal  
 
9.1 Parameters to be monitored  
Participants will be closely monitored for adverse reactions by medically qualified staff during the 
invasive procedures; including the tissue biopsy procedures, the blood sample collection . Appropriate 
medical care and treatment will be provided if necessary.  Study pa rticipants will have daily contact with 
the metabolic kitchen staff during weekdays and will be encouraged to report any potential adverse 
reactions to study foods.  
 
During the diet phase and continuation phase, the CPRS will be administered to monitor par ticipants’ mood.  It is 
possible that important information may be revealed about the subject that in some cases may benefit from 
medical intervention.  In this case, the patient will be advised to share this information with their doctor for 
follow -up.  F urthermore, with the patient’s consent, results from these tests will be forwarded to their physician of 
choice for follow -up.   
 
Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they do not follow the instructions outlined in the 
protocol and informed consent form.  Non -compliance will be set as a threshold of deviation from the 
provided diet and will be determined by medically qualified staff.  Participants may also, at any time, 
choose to discontinue their participation from the study.

page 26 of 68 11. Statistical Analyses   
 
11.1 Overview   
This study is a three -arm dietary intervention trial with a baseline measurement and with repeated  
measures of the outcome variables ove r time. The primary aim is to measure the pre - post- changes in our 
prim ary outcome variables:  %omega -6 in HUFA,  2-AG and AEA.  In secondary Aim 1, we will  measure 
the rates of change  in our  primary outcome variables.  Exploratory aims will be directed towards the 
extent and rates o f change in our second ary outcome variables (see Section 10 .2) in response to dietary 
interventions.  
 
11.2 Analysis of Data  
Fatty acid concentration data will be examined for homogeneity of variance and normality of distribution, 
and if necessary transfor med to meet this criterion.  A probability of 0.05 or lower will be considered 
significant.  
 
Primary Aim:  The sample size was selected to provide adequate power (0.8) to test our Primary Aim, as 
described in section 11.3.  In this Aim  we plan to assess the  extent of changes in %omega -6 in HUFA; 2-
AG and AEA; after 84 days of targeted dietary interventions. To achieve this aim we will treat the data 
coming from a four -group (control and t wo treatment groups), pre -post study design. There will be a 
measuremen t for all the individuals in the study at randomization and at 84 days. The outcome will be the 
measurement at 84 days.  
 
Secondary Aim  1: To assess the rate of changes in %omega -6 in HUFA; PL-AA; 2 -AG and AEA; PL -
EPA; and PL -DHA, we will make use of the r epeated measures of the outcome variables measured at 
baseline, and 28, 56 and 84 days  into the diet phase . The goal is to compare the rates of change in these 
outcome variables over time in the three  groups. It is expected that the rates of change will be  fastest in 
Group C (the low LA plus omega -3 HUFA diet group).  
 
Exploratory Aims: Additional exploratory analyses will be performed to further examine the metabolic 
and clinical effects the of dietary interventions by: 1) assessing the extent and rates of change of the other  
metabolic mediators and clinical outcome measures, as detailed  in Section 10; 2) examining the association 
between the changes in blood concentrations of fatty acid precursors (e.g. PL -AA) and their metabolic 
derivatives (e.g . 2-AG); 3) examining the association between changes in precursor fatty acids and clinical 
outcome measures; and 4) examining the association between changes in the metabolic derivatives of 
precursor fatty acids and clinical outcome measures.   
 
 
11.3 Estimation of Power and Sample Size  
We will use one -way analysis of variance to compare the prop ortion of %omega -6 in HUFA measured at 
12 weeks among three groups. Assuming that the %omega -6 in HUFA will be, on average, 0.8, 0.5 and 
0.2 in the three groups at the end of the 12 weeks (as predicted by Lands’ empirical equation and the 
nutrient intake t argets), we calculated required sample size at three values of standard deviation:  the 
maximum value of 0.5, at 0.4 and 0.3. These values translate to root mean square standardized effect is 
calculated as 0.6, 0.75, and 1.0. To detect these effect sizes, at a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05, we 
will need  either 15 individuals per group (s = 0.5), 10 (s = 0.4), or 6 (s = 0.3).

12 Human Subjects protection  
 
12.1 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
The study  will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 
and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
Pre-menopausal women, post -menopausal women, and men are known to have major differences in their 
metabolism of omega -6 and omega -3 fatty acids  (44-48).  Specifically, pre -menopausal women efficiently 
convert dietary omega -6 and omega -3 18-carbon precursors ( omega -6 LA and omega -3 alpha -linoleic 
acid) into omega -6 AA and omega -3 DHA , which compete for incorporation  into tissue membranes (44, 
46, 49, 50) .  Critically omega -6 AA is the immediate metabolic precursor to endocannabinoids (13), the 
primary outcome of the study .  This efficient conversion is due to the effects of estrogen on liver enzymes 
(46, 49) .  Because end ocannabinoids regulate hunger, satiety and metabolism, we expect pre -menopausal 
women to uniquely benefit from lowering dietary LA.  By contrast, men and post -menopausal women are 
inefficient converters of omega -6 and omega -3 18-carbon precursors to AA and  DHA  (14, 44, 46) .  
Because low LA diets are not expected to efficiently reduce tissue concentration s of AA, or its 
endocannabinoid derivatives  in post -menopausal women and men, they are considerably less likely to 
benefit from lowering dietary LA.  
 
12.2 Equitable Inclusion  
The study population will consist of non -pregnant, non -lactating female subjects.  Subjects that fulfill the 
study criteria will be included regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic, religious, political or similar 
factors.  Based on  open recruitment from the NIH federal employee population, the expected racial 
composition of the study population will be 20. 3% African -American, 2.8% Hispanic, 1 5.9% Asian or 
Pacific Islander, 0. 6% Native American and 6 0.4% White (based on Office of Per sonnel Management 
Demographic Statistics available at:  https://www.opm.gov/policy -data-oversight/data -analysis -

12.3 Inclusion of children or other vulnerable subjects  
No children will participate in this protocol because children metabolize fatty acids differently than 
adults, and weight gain is not necessarily undesirable in this growing population.   
  
12.4 Justification of sensitive procedures  
The controlled  dietary variable s to be modifi ed in this study are linoleic acid  and oleic acid, which are 
common nutrients in foods.  There is minimal risk associated with adverse events as fatty acids in edible 
form are GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by federal regulatory agencies.   
 
Procedures that may cause some discomfort to subjects:  
1) Blood sampling:  Trained medical personnel will carry out the blood draws which may cause 
some discomfort to the subject.  
2) DEXA scan:   Trained medical personnel will perform the scan to redu ce discomfort and risk to 
the subject.  The expected e xposure for a scan is (0.001 rem ) or less than one day’s exposure to 
natural background radiation.  
3) Psychiatric and Neuropyschological Assessment measures:   Research team personnel trained in 
the administration of psychometric measures will assist the subject in answering survey questions 
in the vicinity  of trained medical personnel. Any confusion or unexpected response will be taken 
into consideration for f ollow -up by the trained medical personnel.  
4) Tissue Biopsy:    Muscle and adipose tissue biopsies will be performed by trained medical 
personnel.    Subject will be monitored for signs of undue discomfort .  Medication and 
appropriate palliative care will be provided if necessary.  
5) 3T MRI Scan:    Trained personnel will perform the scan to reduce discomfort and risk to the 
subject.  In the 3T scanner, it is possible that the patient may experience peripheral nerve 
stimulation resulting in a sensation of mild twi tching, warmth or vibration.  Medical staff will 
monitor the subjects and administer appropriate care if necessary.  
6) Storage of Private Health Information in a Research Database:   Clinical information from each 
subject will be stored in a retrievable databa se at NIH.  This information will remain confidential 
and protected like the medical record of the subject.  Information with identifiers will not be 
released to any investigators or agencies/companies without the explicit consent of the subject.  
7) Storage o f Patient Samples:   Coded blood and tissue samples without patient names or personal 
identifiers will be stored in secured freezers at 5625 Fishers Lane, Room 3N -01 or in the NIAAA 
Clinical Core lab freezers in the 1 -SE area of the clinical center .  Sample s will be processed upon 
completion of the study and destroyed when analysis is complete.  
 
 
Reasons for Sensitive Procedures:  
1) Blood sampling:   Procedure is necessary to find the tissue fatty acids concentrations and [eCBs ].  
Previous work in this area has been performed successfully in rodents, but has not been translated 
to human s in a clinical trial . 
2) DEXA Scan:   Accurate determination of body composition is essential for determining the 
contribution of dietary fatty acid s on body composition . 
3) Psychiatric and Neuropsychological Assessment measures:   These assessments are critical for 
determining each subject’s eating habits, mood, and propensity for addictive behavior at each 
stage in the dietary intervention.  
4) Tissue Biopsy : Muscle and adipose tissue biopsies are needed to determine local and specific 
tissue compositional changes due to the changed LA composition of the diets.

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.1 -17-08)    
   
page 29 of 68 5) 3T MRI Scan:  Non-invasive imaging for body composition is necessary to avoid the risks of dee p 
tissue sampling of subjects for visceral fat and liver composition information.   
6) Storage of Private Health Information in a Research Database:  The storage of clinical 
information in retrievable databases is necessary to facilitate collaborative input an d analysis.  
This information will remain confidential and protected like the medical record of the subject.  
7) Storage of Patient Samples:  The storage of clinical samples is necessary for collaboration and 
assurance of similar analysis conditions across all of the study samples.   
 
 
Notes on Secure Data and Sample Storage:  
Data will be collected and entered on form sets labeled with a unique coded identifier that is not related to 
the patient’s name or any other personal identifier (Soc Security number, NIH e mployee number, etc).  
Data will be kept in a locked cabinet or in secure computer files with access only for the Principal 
Investigator (PI) and Associate Investigators (AIs) involved with the study. When entered into the 
electronic databases, information  will be under the CRC and NIH network regular access control.  In 
addition, any information allowing the identification of the participants will be removed.  The only 
possibility to reconstruct the link between database records and information will be thr ough the unique 
identifier.  The translation key will be stored in a locked cabinet or secure computer file with access 
available only to the PI and AIs named in this protocol document.   
Blood and tissue samples will be destroyed after all of the analyses are completed.  Research data will be 
stored for seven years following the study and destroyed according to NIH guidelines.  
 
 
 
12.5 Safeguards for vulnerable populations  
No vulnerable populations are recruited into this study.  Although NIH employees may p articipate, study 
investigators and their superiors, subordinates and immediate family members  (adult children, spouses, 
parents, siblings) will be excluded. Non-pregnant, non -lactating females will be recruited; but pregnancy 
testing will be provided for these females before sensitive procedures if deemed reasonable and/or 
necessary.    
 
12.6 Qualifications of Investigators  
The Laboratory of Membrane Biochemistry and Biophysics (LMBB), Section of Nutritional 
Neuroscience (SNN) program at NIAAA is an internationally respected lab oratory  in the area of fatty acid 
metabolism and nutritional neuroscience. The central focus of the SNN is to examine the impact of 
deficiencies in long chain omega -3 fatty acids on adverse neurodevelopmental and psychiatric ou tcomes. 
This section translates basic biochemical and biophysical fatty acid and lipid results into clinical 
applications.  
The first in vivo studies of the essential fatty acid (EFA) metabolism in alcoholics and smokers have been 
performed within the SNN.  Highly sensitive and selective methodology has been developed within our 
research group allowing for the safe and non -invasive assessment of EFA metabolism in vivo. Thus, 
arguably the worldwide lead in the metab olomics of EFA  has been gained at the SNN.

13.  Benefits  
This study will provide generalizable knowledge on the impacts of dietary fatty acids on endocannabinoid 
synthesis, satiety, eating behavior, and obesity. T his is an experimental, unproven approach that may not prove 
beneficial  to study participants .   
 
14.  Classification of Risk  
▪ No direct benefit, but likely to yield generali zable knowledge for preventative  nutrition  
▪ More than m inimal risk  
▪ The risks are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.  We will discover critical new 
information on how  modifying  LA in the diet affects metabolism, satiety and body 
composition.  We will also gain valuable insight s the plausibility of future safe dietary 
interventions for the treatment and prevention of obesity as alternatives to risky surgical 
procedures and pharmaceutical products.

16.  Data Safety and Monitoring & 17.   Adverse Event Reporting  
 
16.1  Data Safety and Monitoring  Board  
The main dietary interventi on protocol uses  standard clinical and laboratory procedures to study the 
effects of modifying dietary LA on body composition and response.  Since the research procedures are to 
be performed in adult subjects and such procedures involve minor increase over  minimal risk,  the 
collection, monitoring and analysis of adverse events will be the responsibility of the Principal 
Investigator and the investigative team.  No DSMB will be convened.  
 
16.2 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
Elements of the Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
(1) Monitoring mechanism:   
PI name : Christopher E. Ramsden , MD   Date:  01/03/2018  
  
Protocol number : 11-AA-0028  Version :  9.1  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.1 -17-08)    
   
page 33 of 68 The Principal Investigator and the investigative team will monitor the protocol 
participant daily meal visit data for signs of participant distress and signs of dietary 
non-compliance.  
(2) Frequency:   
The Principal Investigator will meet with study staff weekly to discuss participant 
well-being and study progress.  
(3) Stop or change rules:   
The study will be stopped when 64 participants finish the diet phase.  In the unlikely 
situation that multiple participants experie nce adverse events resulting from the 
consumption of the study foods, these events will be reported to the IRB and the study 
will be evaluated for continuation if these events are determined to be serious and life -
threatening.  Participants will be removed  from the diet at the recommen dation of the 
nutrition team or  if they display signs of a serious adverse event  or non -compliance as 
evaluated by the Principal Investigator, Lead Associate Investigator (s) or nutrition or 
medical staff .   
 
(4) Advanced Plans:   
No interim or futility analys es  are planned .  The study requires more  cohort  to reach the 
estimated sample size of 64 participants.    
(5) Information to be monitored :   
a. Attendance at daily meal visits as recorded in participant medical record ; 
b. Daily vital sig ns as recorded in participant medical record ; 
c. CPRS to monitor participant mood as stated on page 26 . 
(6) Communication:   
A record of participants removed from the diet phase will be reported to the Addictions IRB at 
the time of annual review.  Serious adverse  events will be reported according to the required NIH 
Clinical Center guidelines as stated in section 17 on the next page.  
 
16.3 Data Monitoring for Quality Assurance  
Data monitoring for quality assurance will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and 
the investigative team.   
(1) Monitoring mechanism:   
The Principal Investigator and the investigative team will monitor the protocol 
participant questionnaire d ata and participant binder data . 
(2) Frequency:   
As stated above, paper questionnaire data and other information in the participant 
binders will be reviewed bimonthly .   
(3) Information to be monitored : 
PANAS, POMS and FS psychometric data for each participant will be evaluated for 
self-report form completen ess and status of data entry.  Location and s tatus of 
participant biospecimens will also be tracked and rec orded in study sample 
spreadsheet logs.   Status of  imaging  data will also be noted.

page 34 of 68 Missing psychometric data will be reported to the Principal Inve stigator and summarized in a 
report to the IRB at the time of annual review.   A summary record of participants who refuse 
participation  in the biopsies and MRI scan will also be reported to the IRB at the time of annual 
review.  
 
 
 
17.  Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Adverse events  
In the course of a dietary study, adverse events may occur. Unanticipated adverse events that occur as a direct 
result of research studies initiated at the NIH, but not related to the natural history of the underlying disease will 
be summarized at the time  of the annual review.    
Serious Adverse events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse experience that:  
1. Results in death ; 
2. Is life threatening;  
3. Results in hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization;  
4. Results in persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity;  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
6. Results in a condition, which in the judgment of the investigator represents a significant hazard.   
 
Serious adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to participation in research studies 
performed at the NIH Clinical Center will be reported.  However, serious adverse events (other than death) that 
are clearly and unambiguously due to extraneous causes (accidental, environmental or coincidental events) will 
not be reported.  
All serious adverse events will be reported using the NIH Serious Adverse Event Report Form to the NIAAA 
CNS IRB, and NIAAA Clinical Director as soon as possible , but no later than seven days of death or life 
threatening serious adverse event or within fifteen days after the occurrence of all other forms of serious adverse 
events.    
 
 
18.  Alternatives to participation or alternative therapies  
 
Subjects are healt hy volunteers and are not recruited for the treatment of a medical condition.  
Participants are counseled to continue their usual medical care for the duration of the study.  
 
19.  Confidentiality  
 
19.1 Medical records  
This protocol is covered by a Certific ate of Confidentiality (CoC) issued by the US Department of Health 
and Human Services (US:DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH). This information will remain 
confidential and protected according to NIH guidelines.  Some clinically relevant research da ta will be 
stored indefinitely in the medical record and will be accessible to the patient for review by others of their 
choosing (doctors, insurance companies etc.) after executing a release of information.

page 35 of 68 Data will be collected and entered on form sets labeled with a unique coded identifier that is not related to 
the patient’s name or any other personal identifier (Soc Security number, NIH employee number, etc).  
Data will be kept in a locked cabinet or in secure computer files with access only for the Principal 
Investigator (PI) and Associate Investigators (AIs) involved with the study. When entered into the 
electronic databases, information will be under the CRC and NIH network regular access control.  In 
addition, any information a llowing the identification of the participants will be removed.  The only 
possibility to reconstruct the link between database records and information will be through the unique 
identifier.  The translation key will be stored in a locked cabinet or secure computer file with access 
available only to the PI and AIs named in this protocol document.  
 
The validated psychometric instruments used in this protocol have been converted to an electronic web -based 
secure data entry platform administered by the NIAAA .  The security of the data management system  is curat ed 
by the NIAAA in agreement with NIH data security policies.  
Most data generated in this study will be stored and maintained in the NIAAA clinical database  which is 
password protected and secure.  
 
 
19.3 Sample Storage  
Coded blood and tissue samples without patient names or personal identifiers will be stored in secured 
freezers at 5625 Fishers Lane, Room 3N -01 or in the NIAAA Clinical Core lab freezers in the 1 -SE area 
of the clinical center .  Sample s will be processed upon completion of the study and destroyed when 
analysis is complete.    Any additional collaborations requiring transfer of patient material will be done in 
a coded fashion after informing the IRB and obtaining necessary assurances from  the outside institution.  
The protocol will be amended and IRB approval will be sought when such collaborations are established.     
 
 
20.  Conflict of Interest/ Technology Transfer  
NIH guidelines on conflict of interest have been distributed to all investigators. There are no conflicts of 
interest to report.  Technology transfer is not applicable to this protocol.  
 
 
21.  Compensation   
Remuneration  
Remuneration for participation in this study is based on existing NIH guidelines based on inconvenience,  to offset 
potential loss of earnings and travel expenses. The amount paid will be pro -rated based upon participation, and 
does not include the free foods that will be provided.   
 
For the baseline phase, participants wi ll be compensated a maximum of 2 50 dollars .

S1. Deuterated alpha linolenic acid (d5 -LNA) Infusion Substudy  
         
S2. Precis            
Objective  
To quantify hepatic synthesis -secretion rates of long -chain omega -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega -3 
LCPUFAs) from circulating unesterified alpha -linolenic acid (LNA) in humans consuming a typical US 
diet.  To evaluate the effects of lowering the dieta ry nutrient linoleic acid (LA) as a controlled variable on 
omega -3 LCPUFA synthesis -secretion rates.  Modifications in dietary LA will be offset with reciprocal 
changes in the nutrient oleic acid (OA) to maintain equivalency of calories and nutrients.  
 
Study Population  
A subset of up to 24 participants who are enrolled in the main protocol NIAAA -11-AA-0028 ‘Dietary 
linoleic acid regulation of omega -3 PUFA metabolism; satiety and body composition among overweight 
female subjects’, will be invited to partici pate in this Infusion Substudy.  Participants must be in the final 
two weeks of the main protocol (11 -AA-0028) intervention phase in order to participate in the Infusion 
Substudy.  
 
Infusion Substudy Overview  
Participation in the Infusion Substudy require s one approximately 22 -hour hospital admission visit, 
including an 8 -hour infusion of d5 -LNA with serial blood draws, in addition to the visits of the primary 
protocol.  This additional visit will occur during the final two weeks of the 12 -week diet phase,  i.e., after 
10-12 weeks of exposure to the study diets.  As in the main protocol, participants will be advised to 
continue their usual medical care and medications throughout the study.  
 
Outcome Measures  
Primary Dependent Variables  
The primary outcome wil l be the hepatic synthesis -secretion rate of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from 
infused d5 -LNA.  
 
 
S3. Scientific Rationale for Infusion Substudy  
Potential importance of DHA and its metabolites in addictive disorders  
DHA (22:6n -3) is the most abundant polyuns aturated fatty acid in the human brain and is particularly 
abundant in synaptic phospholipids. DHA has unique chemical and biophysical properties (51), and its 
docosanoid  and endocannabinoid metabolites favorably modulate an array of biochemical processes 
including neurogenesis (52, 53)  and neuro -inflammation (54). Deficits in DHA and its bioactive 
metabolites are proposed to contribute to suboptimal neurological function,  increased relapse 
vulnerability and aggression in cocaine addicts and other substance abusers (55-58).  
 
Can dietary linoleic acid lowering increase hepatic synthesis -secretion rates and tissue 
accumulation of n -3 DHA?  
It is generally believed that synthe sis of omega -3 DHA from dietary LNA is not sufficient to maintain 
adequate DHA in humans (59). However the long -term synthesis of DHA from LNA has not yet been 
evaluated at ‘low’ LA intakes that are consistent with evolutionary and historical US intakes, w hich are 
expected to result in increased DHA synthesis and esterification into tissue phospholipids. High omega -6

page 40 of 68 LA (18:2 n -6) consumption may reduce the omega -3 EPA and DHA content of human tissues by: (1) 
impairing enzymatic conversion of omega -3 LNA (18:3n-3) to 18:4n -3 (the precursor to EPA)  by 
competing for the active site of D6 -desaturase (60); (2) impairing enzymatic conversion of 24:5n -3 to 
24:6n -3 (61), the precursor to DHA (22:6n -3) by competing for the active site of D6 -desaturase in the 
endopla smic reticulum ; and (3) competing with omega -3 EPA and DHA for esterification into the sn -2 
position of phospholipids (62)(Fig. 7 : Omega -3 HUFA biosynthetic pathway).  
 
Fig. 7: Omega -3 HUFA Biosynthetic Pathway  
D-6 desaturase is rate limiting for enzymatic conversion of the omega -3 precursor LNA (18:3n -3) to the omega -3 LCPUFA 
products EPA (20:5n -3) and DHA (22:6n -3).  Red lines indicate that omega -6 LA (18:2n -6) competes with 18:3n -3 and 24:5n -3 
for the active s ite of D -6 desaturase, impairing conversion of LNA to EPA and DHA. LA also competes for incorporation into 
tissue phospholipids (not shown). Variants in theFADS2 gene, which codes for the D -6 desaturase enzyme, also modify the 
efficiency of conversion from  LNA to EPA and DHA.  
 
A randomized trial that compared the effects of an infant formula with high LA (6.7 en%) with a low LA 
infant formula (1.7 en%) on infant tissue omega -3 EPA and DHA supports the proposition that high -LA 
intake decreases tissue omega -3 long -chain PUFA status.  Infants in the low -LA group, compared with 
infants who received the high -LA formula, had 228% higher EPA (1.28 weight% compared with 0.39 
weight%, respectively) and 29% higher DHA (4.48 weight% compared with 3.47 weight%, respect ively) 
in erythrocyte membrane phospholipids. Importantly, however, these infant formulas did not contain the 
preformed omega -6 and omega -3 LCPUFAs present in adult omnivorous diets. Because dietary HUFA 
alter enzymatic conversion of LNA to EPA and DHA (vi a feedback inhibition) (63), it is not yet clear 
what extent dietary LA lowering increases the accumulation of EPA and DHA in normative human 
omnivorous diets.    
 
Advantages of hepatic synthesis secretion rates of EPA and DHA versus fatty acid composition  data  
Assessment of the EPA and DHA composition of blood and other tissues provides a useful snapshot for 
assessing present omega -3 status.  However, fatty acid compositional data do not allow for 
characterization of rates of synthesis -secretion of individual fa tty acids from their precursors.  
Compositional data are therefore of limited use in for quantifying the dose of dietary LNA necessary to 
deliver a given dose EPA and DHA to human tissues. Stanley Rapoport et al. in the National Institute of 
Aging develope d and validated a stable isotope LNA infusion methodology in a rodent model to ascertain

page 41 of 68 the synthesis -secretion rates of EPA and DHA  (64, 65) .  In this collaborative amendment we intend to 
translate their methodology to our human trial to assess whether the omega -6 LA content of human diet is 
a major determinant of whole -body (mainly liver) synthesis -secretion rates of EPA and DHA from 
labeled LNA.  Ascertainment of synthesis -secretion rates will allow for more accurate quantitative 
estimation of amounts of dietary LNA necessary to maintain optimal EPA and DHA, and determination 
of whether dietary LA lowering affects these estimates.  These data may ultimately prove useful in the 
formulation of dietary guidelines, and the human infusion methods piloted her e can be adapted to evaluate 
the effects of other variables (i.e., nutrients, drugs, alcohol abuse) on LNA conversion to EPA and DHA.  
 
Is the relationship between dietary linoleic acid lowering and liver synthesis -secretion of omega -3 
EPA and DHA modified by variants in the FADS1 and FADS2 genes?  
Increases in synthesis -secretion rates of omega -3 EPA and DHA in response to controlled dietary LA 
lowering maybe altered by allele variants in the FADS gene locus (which code for rate limiting enzymatic 
conversion  of LNA into EPA and DHA) ( Figure 7 ). The ‘fast converter’ FADS allele variant indicates 
substantial conversion of the omega -3 precursor LNA to EPA and DHA.  By contrast, the ‘slow 
converter’ allele variant indicates minimal conversion of the omega -3 precursor LNA to EPA and DHA.  
Homozygos ity for the ‘slow converter’ allele may confer neuro -developmental and other risks when 
accompanied by suboptimal dietary intakes of seafood sources of preformed EPA and DHA (66).  
However, associations between alleles and adverse neuro -developmental outcom es have thus far been 
evaluated only in populations with uniformly high LA intakes (considerably higher than historical and 
evolutionary diets without added seed oils).  Comparison of the 8 en% and 1 en% LA dietary 
interventions in this amendment will allo w for evaluation of whether increases in whole -body synthesis -
secretion rates of EPA and DHA after dietary LA lowering are dependent upon FADS gene variants.  
 
S4. Study Objectives and Hypotheses ( d5-LNA Infusion Amendment )  
 
Study objectives  
To demonstrate  feasibility for characterizing the hepatic synthesis -secretion rates of DHA and other 
omega -3 HUFA from infused d5 -LNA in humans. To evaluate the effects of lowering the dietary nutrient 
LA via controlled replacement with OA on DHA synthesis -secretion rat es.  
 
Specific hypotheses   
 
Primary aims  
To demonstrate feasibility for characterizing the human hepatic synthesis -secretion rates of DHA using a 
d5-LNA infusion methodology adapted from an NIH rodent model.  
To assess increases in hepatic synthesis -rates for DHA from d5 -LNA in response to controlled lowering 
of dietary omega -6 LA from 8 en% to 1 en%.  
 
Primary hypotheses  
Hepatic synthesis -secretion rates for DHA from infused d5 -LNA can be successfully quantified in 
humans.  
Lowering dietary intake of LA as a controlled variable from 8 en% to 1 en% will significantly increase 
synthesis -secretion rates for DHA and other omega -3 LCPUFAs.

S6. Study Design and Methods – Infusion Substudy       
Recruitment  
Participants who were randomized to either diet ‘A’ or diet ‘B’ and are in their final two weeks of the 12 -
week diet phase will be invited to participate in the Infusion Substudy. The study dietitian, the only 
investigator who is unblinded to treatment all ocation, will do an initial screen of participant in diet ‘A’ or 
diet ‘B’ who may be eligible to participate. However, enrollment in the Infusion Substudy will require a 
new informed consent administered by the physicians and/or nurse practitioner specifie d in Section S11 
(page 49) .  
  
         
Overview of Infusion Substudy Design and Methods  
After at least 10 consecutive weeks of exposure to study diets, participants randomized to diet ‘A’ or diet 
‘B’ (Table 7, Figure 8) will be invited to participate in t he d5 -LNA Infusion Substudy. No matching 
procedure will be employed. A maximum of 12 subjects in each group will participate.

Fig. 8. Infusion Substudy  Flow Diagram : Participants in Diet Group A (8 en% as LA) and Diet group B (1 en% as LA) are 
invited to participate in the Infusion Substudy. Participation requires one additional 22 -hour study visit after 10 -12 consecutive 
weeks of consuming study diets. Saliva is collected for FADS genotyping in the baseline phase of the main protocol. LA 
indicates omega -6 linoleic acid; d5 -LNA indicates deuterated omega -3 alpha -linolenic acid.  
 
Characteristics of Stable Isotope d5 -LNA Infusion  
Non-radioactive stable isotope -labeled alpha -linolenic acid (17,17,18,18,18 -D5, 98%) (d5 -LNA) in 
potassium salt will be prepared by Cambridge Isotope Laboratory; the product will be tested and verified 
as sterile and non -pyrogenic by Cambridge before delivery to NIH. The NIH Pha rmacy will then mix the 
d5-LNA potassium salt into sterile water and then reconstitute with 25% human albumin, and then verify 
the identity, purity, and dose, sterility and non -pyrogenicity of these infusion materials. These procedures 
are performed in ord er to ensure that the infusion materials meet NIH Pharmacy standards for human 
infusion. George Grimes (Chief of the Pharmaceutical Development Section) is our Clinical Center 
Pharmacy contact (GGrimes@cc.nih.gov 301.496.1031).  
 
A total dosage of d5 -LNA of  approximately 19.2 μmol per kg of body weight will be infused 
intravenously through a 0.2 micron filter at a constant rate for up to 8 hours during the feasibility stage. 
This initial dose estimate was calculated based on published human infusion trials (68) using deuterated 
palmitate and the endogenous steady state concentration of LNA in plasma (23) for an obese subject from 
the main protocol with body weight of 95kg. The half -life of unesterified infused fatty acids in human 
plasma is about 2 minutes, s o that a steady state plasma concentration should be reached in about 10 
minutes (5 half -lives). After the feasibility stage, we will adjust infusion rate, dose and duration.  
 
Estimation of Plasma Volume  
DEXA scans performed as part of the main protocol ( 11-AA-0028) will be used to estimate lean body 
mass for normalization of body fluid volumes as described by Boer.  These estimates for plasma volume

page 44 of 68 will be used in calculating the infusion amount and rate, and in interpreting results as described in 
Secti on S.9.  
 
Time points for Blood Collection and Fatty Acid Analysis  
Timed venous blood samples will be collected from the start of d5 -LNA infusion until 480 min (8 hours) 
to determine plasma levels of esterified and unesterified labeled fatty acids.  Samplin g will be at -10, -5, 
0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 minutes (19 time points). A  
total blood volume of 80 mL  will be collected . Blood samples will be used to determine the plasma 
concentrations over time of endogenous unesterified omega -6 and omega -3 fatty acids (nmol/ml) and d5 -
labeled unesterified and esterified omega -3 fatty acids (nmol/ml)  and endocannabinoids  with GC and 
GC-MS. Collected blood will be centrifuged at 2000g for 1 0 min, and plasma will be t ransferred to 
another tube, and kept at -80°C until assay.  After lipid analysis of esterified and unesterified labeled and 
unlabeled fatty acids, hepatic synthesis -secretion rates will be calculated for EPA, DHA and other 
omega -3 fatty acids as described in Section S.9.  
 
Genotyping  
DNA is collected from sputum for analysis of FADS gene variants as part of the main protocol.

Visual Analog Scale  to assess cra ving and hunger  
Upon completion of the standardized research meal (between 2300 and 2400), participants will complete a brief  
VAS scale  to assess their craving and hunger for food.  The same VAS  will be administered after 8, 10, 12 and 16 
hours of fasting (Infusion day times of 0805, 1000, 1200, and 1600).

There is no required follow -up for this study after completion of the experimental protocol. Participants will be 
advised to continue receiving their usual medical care throughout the duration of the study.  With patient consent, 
clinically -relevant inform ation obtained through participation in the protocol may be shared with participants and 
appropriate health care providers.   
 
Radiation exposure  
There is no radiation exposure from participation in the Infusion Substudy.   
 
Medications and devices requiri ng IND/IDE  
No medications or devices requiring IND/IDE will be used in this study.  
It is important to note that only a trace amount of d5 -LNA is provided in the infusion materials. This 
labeled d5 -LNA is a tiny fraction of the non -deuterated LNA pool present in human plasma and tissues.  
There is a precedent for using intravenous infusio n of (non -radioactive) deuterated stable isotopes of fatty 
acids in human clinical trials. Bernard V. Miller III, MD (NIDDK, Co -I on this Infusion Amendment), 
has performed over 100 stable isotope tracer infusion procedures in human clinical trials in Wash ington 
University School of Medicine -St. Louis, Missouri. A recently published manuscript  (68) describing these 
methods is attached to our amendment submission memorandum.   
 
In 2008, The FDA Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products expressed the following policy 
regarding the use of stable isotopes in investigational metabolic studies: If a substance would not 
otherwise require submission of an IND, then that substance enriched with a stable isotope will not 
require an IND. If the isotope enrichme nt is for metabolic tracer studies employing drugs or non -
pharmacological substances, such as glucose and individual amino acids, for which there are adequate 
data demonstrating their safety and if the substances are used within the limits for which the da ta are 
adequate, no IND will be required. However, oversight by an IRB and obtaining informed patient consent 
are recommended.  
 
Storage of research samples and data  
Please see section 7.6.12  for the main protocol procedures for storage and use of research  samples and data, and 
collaborations on stored research samples and data. The same procedures apply to this Substudy.  
 
S7. Risks and Discomforts – Infusion Substudy  
 
Allergic Responses

page 46 of 68 It is possible that participants could have an allergic response to in fusion materials.  During the Infusion 
Substudy informed consent visit, and again during the infusion visit (prior to infusion), participants will 
provide information on known allergies and if necessary the participants will be excluded.  Participants 
will also be advised to alert the research staff as soon as possible if they experience symptoms such as 
rash, hives, wheezing, or other signs of allergy or distress. A physician or nurse practitioner study 
investigator will be present at the bedside for the f irst two hours, and clinically available throughout the 
remainder of the infusion.  
 
Infection  
It is possible, but highly unlikely, that participants could be exposed to an infectious agent present in the 
human albumin or another component of the infusion m aterials.  In order to minimize the risk of 
infection, the NIH pharmacy will perform pyrogenicity and sterility testing to certify that infusion 
materials meet NIH standards for human infusion. In addition, a 0.2 micron filter will be used to 
administer th e infusion materials at the bedside.  
 
Heat -related Injury  
In order to collect arterialized blood from a hand vein, participants’ hands will be heated to between 45 
and 55°C. Participants will be advised to alert research staff if they experience a pain or a burning 
sensation. It is possible, but unlikely, that participants could experience a burn.  
  
IV Insertion for Infusion and Specimen Collection  
Participants may have some discomfort and bruising at the site of IV insertion for the infusion and serial 
blood collection. Infection in the area of the needle insertion is rare. There is a very small risk of fainting.   
 
Fasting for the Infusion  
Particip ants will undergo a 16 -hour fast beginning at midnight (2400) the day before the infusion and ending at 
the conclusion of the infusion (1600).  Participants will receive IV fluids with electrolytes throughout the infusion 
and a meal at the conclusion of th e infusion.  
 
S8. Subject Monitoring, adverse event grading and withdrawal – Infusion Substudy  
 
Parameters to be monitored  
Participants will be closely monitored for adverse reactions by medically qualified staff during the 
invasive procedures.  The partici pants’ vital signs will be closely monitored during the Infusion Procedure 
testing for any signs of subject distress.  Appropriate medical care and treatment will be provided if 
necessary.  
Participants will be withdrawn from the Infusion Substudy if they d o not follow the instructions outlined 
in the protocol and informed consent form. Participants may also, at any time, choose to discontinue their 
participation from the Substudy.  
 
S9. Outcome Measures ( Infusion Substudy ) 
 
Primary Outcome Measure  
Synthesis -secretion rates for omega -3 DHA with d5 -LNA infusion, after 12 -weeks of exposure to diets 
containing either 8 en% or 1 en% as omega -6 LA.

page 48 of 68 appearance. Any unesterified DHA* or other labeled unesterified omega -3 fatty acids that is released over 
time will have a half -life in plasma of about 2 minutes, and this will be taken into account as well.  
 
In this study, we will use an infusion schedule to raise the co ncentration of d5 -LNA as a step function, 
and will plot  against time.  The initial slope relating the  against time after a 
delay will approximate the synthesis coefficient k* for DHA*; similar coefficients can be obtained for the 
shorter chain labeled n-3 fatty acids.  
 
For more explicit analysis, as time proceeds, we will fit equation 4 to the data after inserting a time delay 
using a curve fitting procedure, to obtain for the different n -3 products. is the coefficient of 
conversion by whole body per given concentration of plasma LNA, in units of nmol/time, e.g. (nmol/ml, 
concentration) per unit time multiplied by ml (volume).  This rate can be compared to our estimated rates 
of liver synthesis at the steady state, , in rats following the intravenous infusion of LNA* . is the 
plasma unesterified concentration of LNA.  
 
 
The concentration curves representing LNA* and DHA* should look like Figure 9:  
 
Fig. 9. Graphical depiction of concentration curves for d5 -LNA and DHA.  
 
S10. Statistical Analyses (Infu sion Substudy)  
Overview  
This Infusion Substudy first demonstrates feasibility for characterizing the hepatic synthesis -secretion rates 
of DHA from infused d5 -LNA in humans, and then compares synthesis -secretion rates of omega -3 DHA in 
two diet groups that differ only in dietary omega -6 LA content.   
 
Analysis of Data  
Primary Aim 1: In the feasibility portion of this study we will define the dose, rate and duration of the d5 -
LNA infusion necessary to characterize synthesis -secretion rates of DHA from infused d5 -LNA.  Based on 
our previous experiences using this methodology in a rodent m odel, we anticipate that these data can be 
obtained from the first 4 infusion participants.  
 
Primary Aim 2:  
In the diet group comparison, we will compare synthesis -secretion rates for omega -3 DHA from d5 -LNA 
in response to controlled dietary omega -6 LA low ering from 8 en% to 1 en%.  The synthesis -secretion

page 49 of 68 rate of labeled serial concentration data for labeled DHA will be compared in the two diet groups using a 
t-test. A probability of 0.05 or lower will be considered significant.  
The FADS genotype will be measured as part of the main protocol.  This will allow us to assess whether 
the “low converter” FADS genotype is a modifying variable, or to rule it out as a confounder.  
 
 
Estimation of Sample Size  
We estimate that 4 to 12 individuals in each group are n eeded to provide adequate power (0.8) to test 
Primary Aim 2, as shown in Figure 10.   
 
Estimation of Power and Sample Size  
We will use a t -test to compare the synthesis -secretion rates and coefficients measured at 4 weeks in the 
two groups (A and B). Assum ing a 20 -30% standard deviation in the synthesis -secretion rates based on 
our prior kinetic work in humans (74) and rodents (64) and a 67% difference in expected change in 
kinetics consistent with Pawlosky et al (74) and prior measured changes in DHA conce ntrations, we 
calculated required sample size(s) (Fig. 10). To detect these effect sizes, at a power of 80% and an alpha 
of 0.05, we will need 4 -12 individuals per group.

S11. Human Subjects protection – Infusion Substudy  
 
For human subjects protection issues that apply to both the main protocol and the Infusion Substudy , 
please see Section 12 (Page 38) of the main protocol. Additional issues that apply to the Infusion 
Substudy are addressed in the following sections.  
 
Justification of sensitive procedures  
Procedures that may cause some discomfort to subjects:  
Prolonged f ast for d5 -LNA Infusion :  Participants are required to fast for up to 16 continuous hours.  
Participants will be provided with IV fluids but are likely to experience some hunger during the 8 -hour 
infusion. They will be provided with a meal immediately afte r infusion.  
IV insertion for d5 -LNA Infusion:  Trained medical personnel will carry out the insertion of two IV 
catheters, which may cause some discomfort to the subject.  
Heated hand:  Each participant’s non -dominant hand will be placed in a heated box for a pproximately 4 
hours during the infusion procedure to obtain “arterialized” blood samples for the proper determination of 
stable isotope tracer enrichment. The temperature inside the box will be set to between 44  to 54˚C 
(between 110 and 129˚F) . A controller will maintain the temperature within ±2 degrees of the selected 
temperature. No significant adverse effects (including burning) have been reported using this equipment 
for extended time periods during stable isotope tracer infusions studies.  
Blood sampling:  Trained medical personnel will carry out the blood draws, which may cause some 
discomfort to the subject.  
Storage of Patient Samples:   Coded blood and tissue samples without patient names or personal 
identifiers will be stored in secured freez ers at 5625 Fishers Lane, Room 3N -01 or in the NIAAA Clinical 
Core lab freezers in the 1 -SE area of the clinical center .  Samples will be processed upon completion of 
the study and destroyed when analysis is complete.  
 
Reasons for Sensitive Procedures:

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.1 -17-08)    
   
page 51 of 68 Prolonged fast for Infusion: Continuation of the typical 8 -hour overnight fast for an additional 8 hours 
(the maximum duration of the infusion) is necessary in order to minimize the introduction of uncontrolled 
dietary variables that may alter the measured sy nthesis -secretion of omega -3 LCPUFAs (i.e. consumption 
of unlabeled LNA, LA and other competing fatty acids through diet).  
IV insertion and blood sampling for Infusion : These IV catheters will be used for the Infusion and serial 
blood sampling, allowing f or collection of blood on 19 occasions without serial blood draws. Blood 
sampling is necessary to determine the concentrations and labeled and unlabeled fatty acids for 
assessment of synthesis -secretion rates of omega -3 LCPUFAs.  Previous work in this area  has been 
performed successfully in rodents, but has not been translated to humans in a clinical trial.  
Heated hand :  The heated hand vein technique is used to obtain blood samples that are “arterialized”, 
meaning they are more like arterial blood than ven ous blood. Using the heated hand vein technique is 
standard procedure used during stable isotope tracer infusion studies to ensure proper assessment of 
substrate kinetics. The heated hand vein technique avoids the use of more invasive procedures such as an  
arterial line.   
Blood sampling:   Procedure is necessary to assess the concentrations of labeled and unlabeled fatty acids 
in order to calculate hepatic synthesis -secretion rates for omega -3 DHA.  Previous work in this area has 
been performed successfully in rodents, but has not been translated to humans in a clinical trial.  
Storage of Patient Samples:  The storage of clinical samples is necessary for collaboration and assurance 
of similar analysis conditions across all of the study samples.   
 
 
 
 
 
Qualifications of Investigators – Infusion Substudy  
 
Introduction  
Enrollment in the Infusion Substudy will require a new informed consent, obtained via a face -to-face 
meet ing with Dr. Ramsden  and/or Laura Musse, CRNP, MS.  
The Brain Physiology and  Metabolis m Section (BPMS) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), of 
which Stanley I. Rapoport is Chief, is collaborating on the d5 -LNA Infusion Amendment. The BPMS 
conducts basic and clinical research related to factors that regulation brain function and structu re in health 
and disease. One focus is to identify the influence of dietary composition and liver metabolism of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Methods are developed to image regional brain metabolism of 
omega -6 AA and omega -3 DHA in unanesthetized an imals and in humans (with positron emission 
tomography), and to quantify the ability of the liver to synthesize these PUFAs from their precursors LA 
and LNA, respectively, in vivo. The BPMS has developed the infusion methodology and analysis in 
rodents, wh ich is a basis of this clinical amendment.  
 
D5-LNA Infusion Amendment Collaborators  
 
Stanley I. Rapoport, M.D., is Chief of the BPMS NIA, who has published extensively in the areas of lipid 
metabolism and brain function in health and disease.  He received  his MD degree from Harvard Medical School, 
and is clinically credentialed at the NIH Clinical Center. The laboratory that he directs has developed and 
validated the infusion method and analysis in rodents.  These methods form a major basis for the Infusio n 
Amendment employed in this human protocol. He is involved in the design of the protocol, and its conduct, and in 
data analysis and writing up results.  
Dr. Rapoport will not obtain consent .

S12. Benefits  
This Infusion Substudy  will provide generalizable knowledge on the normal DHA synthesis -secretion rates in 
humans, and the impact of dietary fatty acids on hepatic synthesis -secretion of DHA. This experimental procedure 
has no anticipated benefits for study participants.   
 
S13.  Classification of Risk  
▪ No direct benefit, but likely to yield generalizable scientific knowledge  
▪ More than m inimal risk  
▪ The risks are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. We will obtain important 
insights into normal DHA synthesis -secretion rates in humans, and learn whether 
modifying  dietary LA alters synthesis -secretion rates of DHA.  Both findings could 
ultimately have important implications for the prevention and/or adjunctive management 
of conditions including addictive disorders.  
 
S14. Consent documents and process  
 
Who will obtain Consent  
The informed consent process for the Infusion Substudy will include a face -to-face meeting with Dr. 
Ramsden, Dr. Miller and/or Laura Musse, CRNP, MS.  
 
S15. Data Safety and Monitoring & S16. Adverse Event Reporting  
 
S15.1 Data Safety and Monitoring Board  
The Infusion Substudy  is two -arm study with an 8 -hour intravenous infusion of a non -radioactive nutrient 
in a buffered solution with human albumin.  Since the research procedures are to be performed in adult 
subjects and such procedures involve minor increase over minimal risk , the collection, monitoring and 
analysis of adverse events will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and the investigative 
team. No DSMB will be convened.  
 
S15.2 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
Elements of the Data Safety and Monitoring Pla n 
(1) Monitoring mechanism:   
The Principal Investigator and/or medically qualified staff will monitor the infusion 
protocol participant vital signs data for signs of participant distress as stated on page 
44. 
(2) Frequency:   
The Principal Investigator and/or med ically qualified staff will be present at the 
beginning of the infusion and will stay on the unit for the first 2 hours of the 
procedure.  Medically qualified staff will check the participant vital sign status at 
least hourly after these first 2 hours.   
(3)  Stop or change rules:   
Participants may choose to stop the infusion procedure at any time.  Participants will 
be reminded to report any signs of distress or discomfort to medically qualified staff

page 53 of 68 members.  Medically qualified staff will determine if any signs of participant distress 
are present and are severe enough to abort the infusion procedure.   
(4) Advanced Plans:   
As stated on page 46, this study is designed with the first primary aim as a feasibility 
study and the data will be reviewed after the firs t 4 participants.   
(5) Information to be monitored  for participant safety:   
Participant vital signs (as stated above)  
(6) Communication:   
A record of participants removed from the infusion substudy  will be reported to the Addictions 
IRB at the time of annual review.  Serious adverse events will be reported according to the 
required NIH guidelines as stated in section S16 on the next page.  
 
S15.3 Data Monitoring for Quality Assurance  
Data monitoring for quality assurance will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and 
the investigative team.   
(1) Monitoring mechanism:   
The Principal Investigator and the investigative team will monitor the protocol 
participant free and esteri fied fatty acid data.  
(2) Frequency:   
After each infusion, the blood samples will be analyzed for deuterated fatty acid 
concentration and the results will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the 
investigative team.  
(3) Information to be monitored:  
Deute rated fatty acid concentration will be monitored for appropriateness of infusion 
dose, rate and sampling schedule  
(4) Communication:  
Infusion substudy progress will be reported to the Addictions IRB at the time of annual review in 
the form of a summary report .  This summary report will include the numbers of recruited, and 
enrolled participants in this substudy.  It will also include a brief data report noting any need for 
adjustments in the infusion procedure or sampling schedule . 
 
 
S16. Adverse Event Reporti ng 
 
Adverse events  
In the course of a dietary study and infusion amendment, adverse events may occur. Unanticipated adverse events 
that occur as a direct result of research studies initiated at the NIH, but not related to the natural history of the 
underlying disease will be  summarized at the time of the annual review.    
Serious Adverse events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse experience that:  
1. Results in death;  
2. Is life threatening;  
3. Results in hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization;  
4. Results in persisten t or significant disability/incapacity;  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or

page 54 of 68 6. Results in a condition, which in the judgment of the investigator represents a significant hazard.   
 
Serious adverse events that are possibly, probably or defini tely related to participation in research studies 
performed at the NIH Clinical Center will be reported.  However, serious adverse events (other than death) that 
are clearly and unambiguously due to extraneous causes (accidental, environmental or coinciden tal events) will 
not be reported.  
All serious adverse events will be reported using the NIH Serious Adverse Event Report Form to the NIAAA 
CNS IRB, and NIAAA Clinical Director as soon as possible, but no later than seven days of death or life 
threatening serious adverse event or within fifteen days after the occurrence of all other forms of serious adverse 
events.    
 
 
S17. Alternatives to participation or alternative therapies  
 
Subjects are healthy volunteers and are not recruited for the treatment of a medical condition.  
Participants are counseled to continue their usual medical care for the duration of the study.  
 
S18.  Confidentiality  
 
Medical records  
This information will remain confidential and protected according to NIH guidelines.  Some clinically  
relevant research data will be stored indefinitely in the medical record and will be accessible to the patient 
for review by others of their choosing (doctors, insurance companies etc.) after executing a release of 
information.  
 
Research Data  
 
Data will be collected and entered on form sets labeled with a unique coded identifier that is not related to 
the patient’s name or any other personal identifier (Soc Security number, NIH employee number, etc).  
Data will be kept in a locked cabinet or in secure computer files with access only for the Principal 
Investigator (PI) and Associate Investigators (AIs) involved with the study. When entered into the 
electronic databases, information will be under the CRC and NIH network regular access control.  In 
addition, any information allowing the identification of the participants will be removed.  The only 
possibility to reconstruct the link between database records and information will be through the unique 
identifier.  The translation key will be stored in a locked cabinet or secure computer file with access 
available only to the PI and AIs named in this protocol document.  
 
The validated  psychometric  instruments used in this protocol have been converted to an electronic web -based 
secure data entry platform ) administered by the NIAAA .  The security of the data management system  is curat ed 
by the NIAAA IT department in agreement with NIH data security policies.  
Most data generated in this study will be stored and maintained in the NIAAA clinical database  which  is 
password protected and secure.  
 
Sample Storage  
Coded blood and tissue samples without patient names or personal identifiers will be stored in secured 
freezers at 5625 Fishers Lane, Room 3N -01 or in the NIAAA Clinical Core lab freezers in the 1 -SE area 
of the clinical center .  Samples will be processed upon completion of the study and destroyed when 
analysis is complete.    Any additional collaborations requiring transfer of patient material will be done in 
a coded fashion after informing the IRB and obtaining necessary assurances from the outside institution.  
The protocol will be amended and IRB approval will be sought when  such collaborations are established.

S19.  Conflict of Interest/Technology Transfer  
NIH guidelines on conflict of interest have been distributed to all investigators. There are no conflicts of 
interest to report.  Technology transfer is not applicab le to this Infusion Substudy.  
 
S20.  Compensation  
Remuneration for Infusion Substudy  
Remuneration for participation in the Infusion Amendment is based on existing NIH guidelines based on 
inconvenience, to offset potential loss of earnings and travel expen ses. Since participation involves one 
visit, the amount paid will not be pro -rated based upon participation.  For the completion of all aspects 
Infusion Amendment Visit, participants will be compensated a maximum of 250 dollars .

page 64 of 68 Appendix 2: Lands Equation for Predicting Percentage of omega -6 in HUFA (%omega -6 in HUFA ) 
 
In a series of human experiments, Lands et al. assessed the relationships between 18, 20, and 22 carbon 
omega -6 and omega -3 fatty acid composition of diets, within typical U.S. dietary ranges, and percentages 
of omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA in total HUFA (17). Within these ranges, tissue accumulation of omega -
6 and omega -3 HUFA were surprisingly consistent with the principles that  Mohrhauer and Holman 
observed in rats. By combining human and  animal data, Lands developed empirical equations relating 
fatty acid composition of diet to tissue HUFA content.  
 
 
 
The Lands equation accurately predicts mean population omega -6 and omega -3 HUFA proportions in 
populations with radically different dietary omega -6 and omega -3, supporting validity of the equations. 
Mean tissue percentages of omega -6 in total HUFA ( %omega -6 in HUFA ) varied widely, from less than 
30% to more than 80% of total HUF A, in populations consuming dissimilar diets.  
 
 
In a recent study, the %omega -6 in HUFA measured in whole blood correlated closely with liver, heart, 
and brain HUFA status in autopsied rats and pigs (75). In this respect , %omega -6 in HUFA outperformed 
other HUFA biomarkers including erythrocyte EPA+DHA, which did not correlate with EPA+DHA 
content of any of th ese tissues (75). Thus, the demonstration that the empirical equation of Lands 
accurately predicts changes in %omega -6 in HUFA in blood following major reductions in dietary intakes 
of LA would have important implications for any condition affected by membrane AA content, or any 
disease in which AA -derived mediators have been implicated, no matter which tissues are involved in the 
disease process.

ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 1 Background  and Rationale   
1.1 Background  and Scientific Rationale  
Cockroach allergen has been established as one of the leading causative agents for morbidity in inner -
city children with asthma.1  Although the negative effects of cockroach exposure have been known for 
almost 20 years, eradication and avoidance, which can be imposs ible to achieve in the housing available 
to lower socioeconomic urban population s, is still the mainstay of treatment.2 Given these data, a major 
goal of the NIAID -funded Inner -City Asthma Consortium ( ICAC ) is to  conduct a large multi -center efficacy 
trial of cockroach immunotherapy in inn er-city asthma .  While we have pursued the possibility of using 
sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) given its excellent safety profile, data from the  completed DAIT NIAID -
sponsored P rotocol ICAC -12 BioCSI and  Protocol ICAC -17 BioCSI2 studies  of cockroach SLIT have 
suggested  that SLIT for cockroach may not be effective due to limitations in the maximum doses that 
can be provided with currently available cockroach extracts.3,4 These studies have also generated 
concerns about the likelihood of compliance with daily SLIT therapy, an issue that may both reduce 
efficacy and potentially increase risk.  A pilot study of cockroach SCIT was conducted in 10 adults 
(Prot ocol ICAC -18 SCITCO ) with a primary focus on safety to lay the groundwork for a possible efficacy 
study using SCIT given the distinct possibility that cockroach SLIT will not prove effective and / or  
feasible.   The SCITCO  study demonstrated an excellent sa fety profile, as well as robust markers of 
immunologic response, and with the current study  our goal is to extend that approach into a pediatric 
population.3  
There is a vast clinical and research experience with the use of SCIT for the treatment of asthma and 
allergic rhinitis, as well as stinging insect hypersensitivity.5-12 While there is a higher risk of systemic 
reactions with SCIT compared to SLIT, the overall safety profile of SCIT is very favorable, as is the overall 
SCIT risk benefit  ratio given the markedly salutary effects demonstrated in most studies.  As with SLIT, 
the efficacy of SCIT depends on the use of adequate dosages, but we are confident that the available 
extracts will prove adequate in this regard.9,13  
The rationale for this study is that SCIT may be the only option for e ffective cockroach immunotherapy. 
In fact, the only studies that  demonstrated efficacy  of cockroach immunotherapy used SCIT.14,15 We 
intend in this study to test the effects of cockroach SCI T on asthma control, as well as safety and 
immunologic biomarkers, in a pediatric population.   
Unlike pollen allergy, where symptoms characteristically peak during a particular season, or allergy to 
animals (e.g., cat, dog), where symptoms are induced upon  exposure, there is no specific period during 
the year at which assessment of the efficacy of SCIT on natural cockroach allergen exposure can be 
undertaken.  This only leaves the option of year -round clinical evaluations of symptoms, medication use, 
lung f unction and asthma exacerbations as clinical outcomes of a cockroach allergen immunotherapy 
study.  Although these are very relevant outcomes,  our ability to attribute  them directly to the effect of 
single allergen immunotherapy is uncertain . A negative ou tcome could be due either to the failure of 
SCIT to reduce allergic responses to cockroach,  or because ameliorating cockroach allergy is insufficient 
to change the clinical outcome  in polysensitized individuals with asthma .  In this context, provocation 
testing with cockroach allergen could be used to objectively document  the response to  SCIT.  Nasal 
Allergen Challenge  (NAC)  is an established type of provocation testing commonly used in the research 
setting to assess early stage efficacy of nasal allergy treatments, including allergen immunotherapy, and 
to study the pathophysiology of allergic reactions in an accessible part of the respiratory tract.16,17  The 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 15 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 outcomes of Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) are not lower airway outcomes, but the purpose of using 
this form of assessment in the context of this trial is to establish that treatment is effective against 
mucosal reactions to the allergen in question and not to substitute for asthma outcomes.  As the  
majority of children with allergic asthma also have allergic rhinitis and improvement in upper respiratory 
control is beneficial in asthma, the nasal challenge may have a direct clinical relevance in a study of 
allergen immunotherapy for asthma.  An alternative approach would have been to establish a bronchial 
cockroach allergen provocation18, but this procedure raises more safety concerns and is more 
complicated and time consuming  than Nasal Allergen Challenge  (NAC) .       
Very few studies examining nasal challenge with cockroach allergen have been reported, and no study 
provides adequate information on safety and do sing in adults or children .19-21 For further details, please 
refer to DAIT NIAID’s Investigator Br ochure (IB) for German Cockroach Allergenic Extract for Nasal 
Allergen Challenge  (NAC) .   
1.2 Rationale for Selection of Investigational Product or Intervention  
The investigational agent  for Protocol  ICAC -28 is 1:10 w/v non-standardized glycerinated German 
cockroach ( Blattella germanica ) allergenic extract  obtained from Stallergenes  Greer (Lenoir, NC)  
administered by the subcutaneous  route . Placebo for immunotherapy is (glycerin 50% v/v, Sodium 
Bicarbonate 0.091%, Sodium Chloride 0.166 %, water for injection q.s .) administered by the 
subcutaneous route  obtained from  Allergy Laboratories, Inc. (Oklahoma City , OK).   
The selection of this particular extract was based on the potency of German cockroach extracts available 
for skin testing and allergen immunotherapy on the market. The maintenance dose for ICAC -28 will be 
approximately 6 micrograms (mcg).  No data exists  as to the clinically effective dose allergen for SCIT. 
Therfore  the maintenance dose was selected based on information from other allergens where 
maintenance doses range from 5 to 15 micrograms have proven effective,9,13 and in the SCITCO  trial 
(Protocol ICAC -18) a maintenance containing 6 mcg of Bla g 2 induced consistent immunologic 
responses.3      
1.3 Preclinical Experience  
Not applicable.  
1.4 Clinical Studies  
1.4.1 Immunotherapy  
While only two published studies have assessed the potential efficacy of cockroach SCIT,14,15 there is a 
vast body of literature and clinical experience with the use of SCIT for other allergens.  A recent practice 
parameter detail ed the use of SCIT for inhalant allergens as well as stinging insects.5  In addition, meta -
analyses have confirmed the effectiveness of SCIT for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and 
stinging insect hypersensitivity.7,8,11,12 A 2003 Cochrane review of 75 trials including 3188 patients with 
asthma found that overall SCIT led to a significant reduction in asthma symptoms, medication use, and 
bronchial hyperreactivity.8  For example, in that review, it was dete rmined that it would have been 
necessary to treat 4 patients with immunotherapy to avoid 1 deterioration in asthma symptoms and 5 
patients to avoid 1 requiring increased asthma medication.  
With regard to the published studies on allergy to cockroach, Kang  et al.  studied 28 adults with asthma 
and positive cockroach allergen skin tests; all had positive skin tests to other inhalant allergens as well.14 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 16 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 Subjects were randomized to immunotherapy with cockroach allergen extract (active group, n = 15) or 
immunotherapy with allergens other than cockroach (control, n = 13), and treated for 5 years. Upon 
study completion, 5 of the c ontrol subjects had switched to cockroach immunotherapy and 6 subjects (4 
active, 2 control) were dropped from the study. In the active group, average symptom scores decreased 
from 7.2 at baseline to 1.2, while the control group showed no change. IgG antib odies against cockroach 
increased in the treated group. Adverse reactions were not mentioned.   We do not know how the 
extract used in this trial compares in terms of antigen content and stability with the one that will be 
used in Protocol ICAC -28. 
The seco nd study on cockroach SCIT actually focused on American cockroach, an allergen far less 
important in inner cities, and the U.S. in general, than German cockroach.15  In this double -blind, 
placebo -controlled trial , 50 patients with asthma,  rhinitis or both were treated with cockroach SCIT or 
placebo for one year.  They found that active SCIT led to significant improvement in clinical parameters 
compared with baseline values and the placebo group .  They also demonstrated modest reductions in  
cockroach -specific  IgE levels and significant increases in specific IgG4 levels.   
1.4.2 Nasal Allergen Challenge  (NAC)  
There have been three reports of Nasal Allergen Challenge  (NAC)  with cockroach extract in the 
literature .19-21  
In the Hosen study, 174 patients  of unreported ages underwent nasal provocation testing to insects 
common to Texas.  An unclear number of these patients underwent nasal provocation testing 
specifically to cockroach .  The extract used as the diagnostic agent was a powdered concentration of 
cockroach, which was directly inhaled by the patients  in the setting of Nasal Allergen  Challenge  (NAC)  
with multiple allergen extracts in powdered form.  Participants would be treated with phenylephrine 
hydrochloride  and, if needed, a bronchodilator in between allergen challenges.  Sixty -nine  patients were 
reported to have had a systemic re action to 1 of the allergen extracts.  For cockroach in particular, 16 
total reactions were reported, of which 11 were nasal, 2 were listed as bronchial asthma, and 3 were 
listed as post -nasal and upper bronchial.21  
In the Okuda study, 560 patients  from the ages of 4 to 80 years old (mean 31.3 years; 112 participants 
were 19 years old or younger) with allergic rhinitis were recruited to undergo an evaluation for insect 
allergy.  Sixty -five participants of unknown ages were selected by unspecified means fr om the pool of 
560 patients to undergo Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) with a mixture of German  cockroach, 
Chironomus yoshimatsui , and silkworm moth.  The publication did not mention whether there were any 
adverse reactions from the Nasal Allergen Challenge  (NAC) .19  
The most recent and informative  study evaluated the concept of localized allergy in patients with 
nonallergic  rhinitis.  In that study, 16 adult volunteers underwent sequential nasal allergen  testing with a 
variety of aeroallergens, inc luding a cockroach extract mix.  The cockroach mix nasal allergen testing was 
done with an arbitrarily chosen single dose of 100 µL of 1:5000 (w/v),  and no testing was conducted 
prior to the challenge to establish a dose.  No adverse events were reported  in this published report.20

3 Study  Design  
3.1 Description of Study Design   
This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter trial of non-standardized 
glycerinated German cockroach  (Blattella germanica ) allergenic extract or placebo treatment 
administered by subcutaneous injection . 
Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups  in a ratio of 1:1 : 
1. German cockroach allergenic extract administered by subcutaneous injection.  
2. Placebo administered by subcutaneous injection.   
Protocol ICAC -28 will enroll eighty 8 to 17-year -old cockroach sensitive children with asthma with a 
positive cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) before randomization .  
 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 18 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 The intended maintenance dose of Germa n cockroach allergenic extract is  ≈6 mcg of Bla g 2. The study 
will be based on a treatment schedule with German cockroach allergenic extract or placebo  for 12 
months . 
There will be a Screening phase  to determine eligibility , including  a positive IgE and skin test to German 
cockroach . If asthma control parameters are not met , participant s will begin a run-in period , during 
which participants’ asthma medications will be adjusted for up  to 4 months to achieve symptom control 
before completing an initial NAC procedure. Eligible participants  with a positive NAC will th en be 
randomized to one of the two treatment arms and receive their first injection.  Up to 2 doses of SCIT will 
be given weekly during dose escalation, separated by a minimum of 2 days. Dose escalation can be 
delayed at any point  for systemic or local reactions, although to continue to maintenance  each 
participant will need to reach the minimum maintenance dose in a maximum of 40 weeks  (see Appendix 
B: Study Restrictions Due to COVID -19).  Onc e the maintenance dose is achieved, participants will 
receive two additional  maintenance level -doses (for a total of three maintenance level -doses) spaced 
approximately 2 weeks apart , followed by maintenance injections every 4 weeks  for the remainder of 
the treatment period .   
At Randomization and every 2 months during treatment, an asthma Evaluation and Management (E&M) 
process will occur where participants’ asthma medication regimen will be adjusted based on symptoms, 
albuterol/levalbuterol use, FEV 1, recent exacerbations, and their current level of therapy.  
All participants must have a positive cockroach NAC , as defined by reaching a Total Nasal Symptom 
Score (TNSS) of ≥  6 or a sneezing score of 3 at Dose 2 or higher during the challenge  before 
rand omization  and will undergo follow -up NAC procedures at 12 months .  
Blood  will be collected at Screening, prior to  Randomization , and after 12 months of treatment  for 
assessment of biomarkers of allergen immunotherapy , such as cockroach -specific  IgE, IgG4, and 
component allergens, including Bla g 1,  Bla g 2,  Bla g 4, Bla g 5, and Per A 1, and  inhibition of cockroach 
antigen binding to B -cells . Skin testing (German cockroach) will be performed during the Screening  
phase  and at 12 months .  CASI will be collected every 2 months (See Visit Activities Summary, Appendix 
A).  
Adverse events ( AEs) will be assessed at each study visit. Pulmonary function and rhinitis  and asthma 
symptom questionnaires will also be administered at Screening and every  two month s thereafter .

3.5 Stratification, Randomization, and Blinding /Masking  
The randomization schedule will be generated by the DAIT NIAID Statistical and Clinical Coordinating 
Center (SACCC) and implemented in a validated system that will be used by site personnel to automate 
the random assignment of treatment groups to study participants.   The randomization scheme will be 
reviewe d and approved by a statistician at the DAIT SACCC and will not be modified thereafter except to 
accommodate any changes required by amendments  to the protocol . Participants will be randomized 
using a 1:1 ratio of active (German cockroach extract) and con trol (placebo) participants. Randomiz ation 
will be stratified by site. 
Randomization data will be  kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized persons, until the 
time of unblinding. When the study has been completed, the data files verified, a nd the protocol 
deviations  determined , the investigational agent codes will be broken and made available for data 
analysis.  
The clinical site ’s research pharmacy will dispense  to the clinical research site unblinded nurse  the study 
drug based on the unique  vial IDs communicated by the randomization system at randomization and any 
subsequent dosing visits . The SCIT  injections will be administered by  trained clinical research staff . Prior 
to injection, an unblinded staff member will confirm the expiration dat e, the dose, and 
randomization /investigation al product  assignment  kit number .  
3.5.1 Procedure for Unblinding/Unmasking  
Unblinding must be approved by the DAIT /NIAID Medical Monitor  (MM)  unless an immediate life-
threatening  condition has developed and the Medical Monitor is not accessible.  Automatic notifications 
of any unblinding event will be sent to study personnel as specified in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP. 
Unblinding events will also be reported to the NIAID Allergy and Asthma Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB).  
A full account of the event will be recorded, including the date and time of the unblinding, the reason 
for the decision to unblind, and the name of the individual who made the decision and the names of the 
DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor and others who were notified. The reasons for unblinding of a participant’s 
treatment will be included in the final clinical study report.  
Unblinding the study due to an approved interim analysis, final analysis, or study terminat ion will 
require written approval from  the DAIT  NIAID  Medical Monitor .

 4 Selection of Participants and Clinical Sites/Laboratories  
4.1 Rationale for Study Population  
Because the combination of cockroach allergy and cockroach exposure is one of the most important  
factors contributing to the  increased asthma morbidity seen in inner -city children with asthma , a major 
goal of the NIAID -funded ICAC is to conduct a large multi -center efficacy trial of cockroach 
immunotherapy in this population . DAIT NIAID -sponsored studies of SLIT – Protocols ICAC -10, ICAC -12, 
and ICAC -17 (IND # 13163) in both adults and children had limited success and pointed to challenges 
with adherence to the daily dosing regimen. Daily adherence may be particularly difficult for children 
and adoles cents. DAIT NIAID -sponsored Protocol ICAC -18 SCITCO  (IND exempt, BB -IND # 14330) study in 
adults, on the other hand, demonstrated an excellent safety profile, as well as robust biomarkers of 
immunologic response, and with the current study  our goal is to extend that approach into a pediatric 
population using CASI as the primary measure of efficacy.

5 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Participants  
5.1 Risks of Investigational Product or Intervention as cited in Investigator Brochure  or Package Insert  
Per “Allergen ic Extract : Instructions for Use and Dosing Schedule ”  (Allermed Laboratories, I nc., San 
Diego, CA) , “Allergenic Extracts Pollens, Mold, Intradermal, Insects, Dust, Food and Miscellaneous  
Inhalants : Suggested D ose Schedule and Instructions ” (Greer, Lenoir, NC) and the current version of 
DAIT NIAID’s Investigator Brochure German Cockroach Allergenic for Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) , 
risks  of exposing participants to allergens via immunotherapy include, but are not limited to: itching of 
the mouth, ears, and throat, itching or swelling of the eyes, nasal congestion, sneezing, rh inorrhea, oral 
or throat angioedema, cough, chest tightness, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, 
abdominal pain), skin symptoms (rash, hives, swelling, itching), and anaphylaxis. We expect that the 
main sign  and/or symptom experienced by participants will be localized swelling at the injection site 
occurring within 30 minutes after administration of the immunotherapy injection. Large local reactions 
associated with allergen immunotherapy are common, with a frequency ranging from 26% to 86% of 
injections.22 
Additionally, clinical research staff may apply a topical anesthetic to the skin before giving the injection 
to reduce the discom fort of the stick. Side effects from  topical anesthetics include erythema, burning, 
paleness at the skin site, edema, and alterations in temperature. Reactions are mild and transient. There 
is a potential for cutaneous allergic reactions to topical anesthe tics.  
The risks to a fetus are unknown and SCIT is generally not initiated during pregnancy. Pregnant females 
will be excluded from the Protocol  ICAC -28. All females who have reached menarche will be required to 
have a urine pregnancy test before completi ng study activities at Screening, Randomization, 12-month  
visit, visits where the NAC is performed, monthly during the escalation phase, and at each Evaluation 
and Management Visit (E&M) during maintenance . Urine pregnancy testing will ensure no pregnant 
female will be entered into the study , and any female becoming pregnant during the study  will be 
discontinued.  Safety follow -up of pregnant participants is described in section 12.6.  
5.2 Risks of Investigational Product Cited in Medical Literature  
In published studies of SCIT,  systemic anaphylactic reactions with other inhalant allergens have been 
reported to occur in from 1% of patients to as many as 36% of patients receiving SCIT using a rush 
schedule.23,24 Protocol ICAC -28 does not involve a rush immunotherapy schedule. Fataliti es are very rare 
but have been reported, as have specific risk factors for fatal reactions, which include unstable asthma, 
beta -blocker therapy, rush immunotherapy, and use of high doses of potent standardized extracts.23 In 
our SCITCO  study  (Protocol ICAC -18), in 10 adults undergoing six months of SCIT, there were 2 serious 
adverse neither  of which  were  considered  related  to the therapy .3  
5.3 Risks of Other Protocol Specified Medications  
The risks from inh aled corticosteroids (ICS)  are minimal but may include upper respiratory tract 
infection, throat irritation, sinusitis/sinus infection, upper respiratory inflammation, rhinitis, oral 
candidiasis, nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal discomfort, viral gastrointestinal infection, no n-
specific fever, viral infection, viral respiratory infection, cough, bronchitis, headache, muscle injury, 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 24 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 musculoskeletal pain, and injury. ICS have also been associated with modest growth effects. Height will 
be monitored throughout the study, by calibr ated stadiometers.   
Oral corticosteroids can cause hoarseness, sore throat, and yeast infection of the mouth or throat if 
taken in high doses for lengthy periods of time.  In addition, they can cause effects on the body such as 
weight gain, growth delay, bruising of the skin, cataracts, and diabetes. These effects are more likely if 
the medicine is taken at very high doses for extended periods of time.  These side effects are not 
anticipated in this study because of the length of time (4 days on any occasi on) that oral corticosteroids 
will be taken.  
The risks of long acting  beta agonists (LABAs) include diarrhea, nausea, asthma exacerbation, bronchitis, 
respiratory infection, anxiety, fever, dizziness, insomnia, chest pain.  There is also a small, but 
stati stically  significant risk of asthma -related death. This study will follow black box guidelines by using 
LABAs as an adjuvant therapy in patients not adequately controlled on inhaled steroids.  
The risks from inhaled albuterol include increased heart rate an d blood pressure, nausea, headache, and 
a jittery or nervous feeling. These symptoms usually resolve within one hour.  
5.4 Risks of Study Procedures  
5.4.1 Skin Prick Tests  
Participants may experience mild to moderate pruritus or local discomfort at the sites of skin  pricks with 
allergen and the positive control (histamine dihydrochloride 10 mg/mL). Usually, the allergen -induced 
wheal and flare responses resolve within 1 –2 hours, but rarely a participant may have local swelling that 
takes 2-3 days to clear entirely. R arely skin testing will cause the participant being tested to have 
systemic allergic symptoms. These symptoms may include sneezing, ocular pruritus and tearing, 
rhinorrhea and/or generalized pruritus or urticaria. Treatment with topical corticosteroids and  oral 
antihistamines is available and is effective. A study clinician  is always present and drugs and equipment 
for treatment of anaphylactic reactions are available.  Stopping antihistamines before skin testing may 
make allergy (but not asthma) symptoms wo rse. Participants will be told they can take their medications 
if they need them, but the test will need to be rescheduled.  
There is also a very rare chance that the participant may experience a systemic allergic reaction or 
fainting.   A study clinician wi ll be available to provide immediate treatment,  if needed.   Further, we 
believe that performance of such allergen evaluation is consistent with national asthma guidelines, and 
provides direct benefits to participants. The results of the skin tests are prov ided to participants.  
5.4.2 Venipuncture  
The risks associated with a blood draw include possible pain from the stick, as well as bleeding, bruising, 
and infection of the skin. Lightheadedness and fainting rarely occur. To minimize these risks, a clinical 
researc h staff member who is trained to draw blood from children will collect the samples. Additionally, 
clinical research staff may apply a topical anesthetic to the skin before the blood draw  to reduce the 
discomfort of the stick. Side effects from  topical anes thetics include erythema, burning, paleness at the 
skin site, edema, and alterations in temperature. Reactions are mild and transient. There is a potential 
for cutaneous allergic reactions to topical anesthetics. Topical anesthetics are routinely used for usual 
care venipunctures to minimize discomfort. The amount of blood to be collected is within the NIH 
pediatric guidelines.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 25 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 5.4.3 Spirometry  and Peak Flow Measurement  
Spirometry and peak flow measurements will be performed by trained and certified clinical rese arch 
staff according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards as performed routinely in usual care as part 
of subspecialist management of asthma.  
Spirometry and peak expiratory flow measurement can cause coughing or lightheadedness, which will 
go away shortly after the test is finished.  
5.4.4 Nasal Allergen Challenge  
Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC)  involves the direct application  by trained  clinical research staff  of one or 
more defined doses of allergen onto the participant’s nasal mucosa using a nasal drug delivery system 
(LMA® MAD Nasal delivery system LMA/Teleflex, San Diego, CA ). Nasal Allergen Challenge is expected to 
cause allergic symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, nasal discharge, and itchy, watery eyes  
which may last up to several hours aft er the last dose is administered . If nasal and/or ocular symptoms 
persist after the period of observation in the clinical unit , participants will be offered treatment with oral 
antihistamines. There is a very small risk of provoking asthma  symptoms. If PEF is reduced by more than 
20% from baseline or if asthma symptoms develop at any step during the NAC , the procedure will be 
suspended , the participant will be treated, and FEV 1 will be measured . To minimize this risk, individuals 
with a pre -bronchodil ator FEV 1 of less than 80% of predicted  are not allowed to perform this procedure .  
In addition,  a targeted pulmonary exam will be conducted at each NAC visit. The allergen will be 
delivered to the nose while subjects are breath holding at Total Lung Capac ity (TLC) and will be asked to 
exhale through their nose thereafter thus minimizing the potential for allergen  to reach the lower 
airways.  As for any intervention with allergen  to which the patient is sensitive , there is the slight  risk of 
developing an a naphylactic reaction. Trained personnel, including a study clinician , as well as 
medications and equipment, will be immediately available to treat any reaction.  
A recent DAIT NIAID -sponsored clinical study evaluated the safety of cockroach nasal allergen c hallenge 
in adults and children with asthma. Protocol ICAC -27 CoNAC  conducted under DAIT NIAID -sponsored 
IND #16512  performed cockroach nasal allergen challenges on twenty -five children , and no reportable 
adverse events  were  linked to the study drug. Nasal  allergen challenge has been performed with other 
allergens (perennial and seasonal) in children with asthma and found to be low risk.  Mild cough or 
wheezing developed shortly after the nasal challenge in 2 out of 25 children,25 while in another study a 
slight drop (10%) in FEV 1 was noted in 1 out of 50 children immediately following nasal allergen 
challenge.26  Twenty -four hours after the NAC , 1 out of 50 children h ad an asthma exacerbation with a 
febrile viral infection.26 Pedroletti et al. demonstrated that a single nasal allergen challenge with cat 
allergen was not associated with increased bronchial inflammation, as assessed by F ENO, among cat 
allergic children with asthma.27 For further details, please refer to the Investigator Brochure for German 
Cockroach Allergenic Extract for Nasal Allergen Challenge.   
5.4.5 Nasal Lavage  
Nasal lavage may be associated with some transient discomfort due to the < 10 second  breath hold and 
the feeling of fluid in the nares. A very rare potential complication of nasal lavage is acute bacterial 
sinusitis (sinus infection). The nasal lavage proce dure is considered minimal risk, and is often referred to 
as a nasal wash or nasal irrigation. A variety of over -the-counter products (such as the neti -pot filled 
with a saline solution) have been widely available for home use to safely flush out nasal pas sages and 
alleviate both nasal congestion and even sinusitis symptoms.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 26 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 The study clinician may use their discretion as to whether to administer a nasal decongestant prior to 
the nasal lavage. The nasal decongestant may be associated with temporary discomf ort such as burning, 
stinging, sneezing, or an increase in nasal discharge.  
5.4.6 Influenza  Vaccine  
As part of standard  of care, the study clinician will recommend the particip ant obtain the current 
influenza  vaccine. Minor side effects are soreness, redness or swelling at the injection site, low grade  
fever and aches. If these problems occur, they begin soon after vaccination and are mild and short -lived. 
Almost all people who receive influenza vaccine have no serious problems from it. On rare occasions, flu 
vaccination can cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.  
5.4.7 Questionnaires  
There is a possibility that participants may find the questions too personal.  Participants may refuse to 
answer any questio ns that make them feel uncomfortable.  
5.5 Potential Benefits  
The results of the skin testing will be provided to participants. Participants will receive relevant asthma 
education consistent with Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR 3)  for patients 
with asthma , including handouts listing ways to avoid common allergy and asthma triggers.  The national 
asthma guidelines have emphasized that exposure of patients who have asthma to allergen s to which 
they are sensitive has been shown to increase  asthma symptoms and precipitate asthma exacerbations. 
Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR 3)  state that the clinician should evaluate 
the potential role of allergens, particularly indoor inhalant allergens via medical history and sk in testing, 
and then assess the significance of positive tests in the context of the patient’s medical history. Patients 
who have asthma at any level of severity should: (1) reduce, if possible, exposure to allergens to which 
the patient is sensitized and exposed; (2) know that effective allergen avoidance requires a 
comprehensive approach; and (3) be provided with relevant educational materials for control of 
environmental factors.  
While the participant’s asthma may or may not improve while in this study,  participants may directly 
benefit from study participation by receiving study -based asthma assessments and care from an asthma 
specialist.  The participants will receive close monitoring and direct management of asthma 
exacerbations on a 24/7 basis through out the study. Participants with uncontrolled asthma at Screening 
will benefit by having additional visits to bring their asthma under control before Randomization. 
Participant families will receive contact numbers for the study site and a tailored asthma action plan and 
education. A supply of prednisone will be provided in concert with this management.   
In the longer term, this study may promote the further development of cockroach SCIT for asthma and 
allergic rhinitis, which could be a major advance in th e care of individuals with these conditions who are 
allergic to cockroach antigens.   
6 Investigational Agent  
6.1 Investigational Agent  
Non -standardized  glycerinated German cockroach (Blattella germanica ) allergenic extract  (50% glycerin) 
will be used as the investigational agent in Protocol ICAC -28. Commercially -labeled  licensed product was 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 27 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 purchas ed by the IND Sponsor from the manufacturer - Stallergenes Greer (Lenoir, NC)  and distributed  
to the clinical research sites by DAIT  NIAID drug distributor (Eminent Services Corporation, Frederick, 
MD).   
6.1.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling  
The active ingredient of the investigational product is a non -standardized allergen derived from the 
extraction and purification of proteins from German cockroach ( Blattella germanica ).  The allergenic 
extract contains the aqueous extractable  from allergenic source material in extracting solution 
containing 0.25% sodium chloride, 0.125% sodium bicarbonate, and 50% glycerol.  Phenol (0.4%) is 
added a fter extraction as a preservative.   
Non -standardized  glycerinated German cockroach allergenic extract is approved  in the United States for 
diagnostic  skin testing and immunotherapy by subcutaneous injection  (U.S. License 467).  It has been 
used in humans for at least 35 years . The recommended storage conditions for the investigational agent 
are 2°C to 8 °C. For this protocol, German cockroach extract will be stored at minus 20°C. Storage at 
minus 20°C is to decrease the rate of degradation of allergen (Bla g5) in the extract.    
6.2 Placebo  
The placebo product for SCIT in Protocol ICAC -28 is a commercially -labeled licensed product, sterile 
diluent for allergenic extract [glycerin (50% ), sodium bicarbonate (0.091%), sodium chloride (0.166%) 
with water for injecti on (q.s.) ]. The commercially -labeled licensed product was purchased  by the IND 
Sponsor from the manufacturer – Allergy Laboratories  (Oklahoma, OK ) and distributed  to the clinical 
research sites by DAIT NIAID drug distributor (Eminent Services Corporation, Frederick, MD).  
6.2.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling  
The placebo for immunotherapy will consist of the same inactive ingredients as the non -standardized 
glycerinated  German c ockroach allergen extract. It is not colored and is in 8mL multi -dose vials.  
6.3 Dosage, Preparation, and Administration  
6.3.1 Subcutaneous Immunotherapy  
Cockroach allergenic extract or placebo is prepared by the clinical site research pharmacist.  Complete 
details of the dilutions can be found in the Pharmacy Manual: Investigational Produc t Preparation and 
Dispensing for Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) for Protocol ICAC -28.   
Participants  will receive  escalating doses  of glycerinated German cockroach allergenic  extract  or placebo 
administered subcutaneously according to the dose escalation  schedule  (Section 8.7.1).  
6.4 Drug Accountability  
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62)  the investigator will maintain 
adequate records of the disposition of the investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the 
drug re ceived, to whom the drug was dispensed (participant -by-participant accounting), and a detailed 
accounting of any drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed.  
Records for receipt , storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by the study site.  The drug -
dispensing log will be kept current for each participant.  These logs will contain the identification of each 
participant and the date and quantity of drug dispensed.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 28 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 All remaining unused investigational product will be returned to the IND sponsor (DAIT, NIAID) or 
sponsor’s representative after study termination, or destroyed with the permission of the sponsor in 
accordance with applicable law and study site procedures.   
All records regarding disposition  of the investigational product will be available fo r inspection by the 
clinical trial monitor.  
6.5 Assessment of Participant Compliance with Investigational Agent  
As participants receive their injections in the clinic, compliance will be monitored by assessing the 
number of expected and completed injection visits.  
6.6 Toxicity Prevention and Management  
In the case of a reaction to the subcutaneous  investigational agent , dosing will be altered according to 
Section  8.6.1 Dose Escalation and 8.6.2. Maintenance Visits.  
6.7 Premature Discontinuation of Investigational Ag ent 
Participants who are unable to reach the minimum maintenance  dose by 40 weeks following the start of 
dose escalation  will be unable to proceed to the maintenance period and will have their study therapy 
discontinued  (see Section 11.2.1 Discontinuation of Study Therapy ; see Appendix B  Study Restrictions 
Due to COVID -19). 
Study therapy may be prematurely discontinued for any participant for any of the reasons identified in 
Section 11.2 .1 Discontinuation of Study Therapy . Study therapy may also be prematur ely discontinued 
for any participant if the study clinician believes that the study treatment is no longer in the best 
interest of the participant. Participants who se therapy is  prematurely discontinued will be follow ed 
when possible for the duration of th e study and seen for all remaining visits except Injection Visits.  
7 Other Medications  
7.1 Concomitant Medications  
7.1.1 Protocol -mandated  
All participants will receive asthma step care according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and 
Management of Asthma.28 Treatment will be supervised by a study clinician. The study clinician will 
prescribe initial appropriate concomitant asthma therapies (see Section 7.1.1.1) and will provide a 
written Asthma Action Plan for the participant at S creening, Randomization, and every two months 
thereafter (see Section 7.1.1.4). The regimen will then be adjusted as necessary at those visits 
throughout the duration of the trial based on the principles of the EPR -3 guidelines (see Table 7.1.1.2a, 
below).   
The study clinician will prescribe the appropriate step controller therapy according to the participant’s 
insurance/health maintenance organization guidelines. The preferred controller steps and alternate 
equivalent medications may be modified or updated b ased on changes in standard clinical practice, 
discontinuation of current medications, or the introduction of new medications. For the standardized 
treatment of asthma exacerbations, the clinical research staff will provide oral prednisone and written 
instructions for use.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 29 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 All participants are required to have medical insurance that will cover, at least in part, the costs of their 
asthma medications. It is likely, however, that some participants may lose this coverage during the time 
that they are in the s tudy. To maintain participant safety and avoid a loss of these participants to the 
study, Protocol ICAC -28 CRITICAL will fund the cost of these participants’ asthma medications  during the 
remainder of the study or until the participant regains insurance co verage during the study. Medications 
will be prescribed in the same manner using the same algorithms as all insured participants. Each 
research site will develop plans to use local pharmacies in a cost efficient  and timely manner. This design 
is in place t o mimic the support typical insured participants receive, i.e. they receive a prescription and 
have to fill it at a pharmacy. To limit the time that Protocol ICAC -28 CRITICAL is required to fund the cost 
of asthma medications for a participant who has lost  coverage, each research site will develop a plan for 
evaluation of insurance options and referral to appropriate support systems to obtain coverage for 
medication costs. In addition to addressing potential insurance from employers and governmental 
sources , this may include free clinics and support programs available through pharmaceutical firms.  
The study clinician is allowed to prescribe treatment for rhinitis symptoms as clinically indicated.  No 
specific rhinitis medications are recommended or required to be used. The choice is study clinician  
discretion.  
7.1.1.1  Initial Regimen  
At the Screening Visit, the study clinician will determine the appropriate asthma control regimen that 
will be prescribed for the participant. Along with the participant’s medical histor y and physical 
examination results, the medication regimen is determined by the participant’s symptoms, number  of 
systemic corticosteroid bursts in the past 6 months, percent -predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV 1), and current level of asthm a controller therapy.  
First, the study clinician will determine the highest “control level” of the participant’s morbidity across 
the 4 categories in Table 7.1.1.1a. For example, if the participant has 8 days with symptoms (control 
level 2), 1 night with symptoms (control level 1), is at 75% predicted FEV 1 (control level 3), and has 0 
systemic steroid bursts, (control level 1), then the participant is at control level 3 because that is the 
highest of these 4 categories.

*** Defined as a prescription of a course of systemic steroids by a clinician or initiation of a course of systemic steroids by a 
participant to prevent a serious asthma outcome. If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic steroids witho ut 
clinician invol vement, this course will be counted only if it meets the following dosage: the course for prednisone, prednisolone, or 
methylprednisolone will be 2 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose for 4 days with a maximum dose of 60 mg per day. The course for 
dexamethasone will be 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose for 2 days with a maximum dose of 16 mg per day.  If a 
corticosteroid burst for the treatment of an asthma exacerbation is prescribed by a non -ICAC  clinician,  it will be counted regardless 
of dose.  
 
Next, the study clinician will determine the current level of controller therapy that the participant is 
using. Table 7.1.1.1b shows the asthma regimens that will be used during the treatment phase of 
Protocol ICAC -28 CRITICAL. If the participant  is currently on one of the therapies below, then the step 
level of that therapy will be noted. Otherwise, the study clinician must refer to the Protocol ICAC -28 
MOP for equivalency tables for other asthma therapies. From the information in the Protocol IC AC-28 
MOP, the study clinician will determine the corresponding step level of therapy that the participant is 
currently using. For example, if the participant is currently taking Flovent® Diskus® 250 mcg twice per 
day (bid), then he/she is receiving Step 3  therapy.  
Table 7.1.1.1b Asthma Regimen by Step Level of Therapy  
Step  Medication Equivalent*  
0 No controller medication; albuterol or levalbuterol prn  
1 fluticasone 50 mcg bid  
2 fluticasone 100 mcg bid  
3 fluticasone 250 mcg bid  
4 fluticasone 250 mcg bid plus LABA  
5 fluticasone 500 mcg bid plus LABA  
bid = twice per day; LABA = long -acting beta agonist  
*Equivalent medication covered by participant’s insurance formulary – see Protocol ICAC -28 MOP.   
 
Based on the participant’s current control level (from Table 7.1.1.1a) and the participant’s current step 
level of therapy (from Table 7.1.1.1b and the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP), the study clinician will find the 
corresponding row in Table 7.1.1.1c below that includes both the current regimen and the current 
control level. The last column of that row gives the corresponding regimen as a step level, which refers 
back to Table 7.1.1.1b. The study clinician will prescribe this regimen.  
Continuing the example from  above, since the participant is taking Step 3 therapy and is at control level 
3, the regimen assigned would be Step 4 (fluticasone 250 mcg bid with LABA).

In addition to the controller regimen assigned above, all participants will be prescribed albuterol by 
metered -dose inhaler beta -agonist or nebulizer (per clinician discretion) to be used as needed and will 
be provided oral prednisone to be used as per protocol – see Section 7.4 .1 and the Protocol ICAC -28 
MOP. The study clinician will prescribe enough medication to last until the next E&M visit. If a 
partici pant is not eligible to continue, the study clinician may prescribe an appropriate treatment 
regimen based on clinical judgment.  
7.1.1.2  Study Period Treatment Regimen  
At Randomization and every 2 months during treatment , an asthma Evaluation and Management ( E&M ) 
process will occur where participants’ asthma medication regimen will be adjusted based on symptoms, 
albuterol/levalbuterol use, FEV 1, recent exacerbations, and their current level of therapy.  
Participants may be stepped down from controller medications if their control level is equal to 1 at 
Screening, Asthma Control Visits, and at some E&M visits while  the participant is in maintenance  (see 
Appendix B: Study Restrictions Due to COVID -19). Participants may not be stepped down from controller

ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 medications at Randomization  or during Dose Escalation. Participants may be stepped up as per the 
protocol algorithm at any visit where indicated.  
Participants will undergo pre -bronchodilator spirometry and an assessment of symptoms, rescue 
bronchodilator usage, rece nt exacerbations and medication adherence. Bronchodilator use as a 
preventive measure prior to exercise will not count toward the assessment of rescue bronchodilator 
use. Based on these data, a study clinician will determine the participant’s current contr ol level from 
Table 7.1.1.2a below. The control levels originated from the published national guidelines, Guidelines for 
the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma.28 
For all participants, the highest control level for days with sympt oms or albuterol/levalbuterol use, 
nights with symptoms or albuterol/levalbuterol use, percent personal best FEV 1, and exacerbation 
history will be determined by the study clinician. The day and night symptoms, albuterol/levalbuterol 
use, adherence to pres cribed asthma controller medications by self -report, and exacerbation history will 
be determined from questionnaires. The FEV 1 personal best is defined in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP. If 
the quality of the spirometry maneuver at the current visit is unaccepta ble according to the technician’s 
judgment, FEV 1 in Table 7.1.1.2a will not be used, and the control level will be based on day and night 
symptoms, albuterol/levalbuterol use, and exacerbation history. For example, if a participant has 0 days 
with symptoms  (control level 1), 4 nights with symptoms (control level 3), FEV 1 at 85% of personal best 
(control level 1), and 1 exacerbation (control level 2), then the participant’s overall control level is 3 
because that is the maximum value of control levels 1, 3, 1, and 2.

single daily dose for 4 days with a maximum dose of 60 mg per day. The course for dexamethasone will be 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/day as a single daily 
dose for 2 days with a maximum dose of 16 mg per day . If a corticosteroid burst for the treatment of an asthma exacerbation is prescribed by a 
non-ICAC clinician, it will be counted regardles s of dose.

ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 Based on the overall control level and the participant’s estimated level of adherence, the study clinician 
will use Table 7.1.1.2b below to determine how the pa rticipant’s current therapy should be modified. At 
E&M Visits, the participant will be considered to have acceptable adherence if he/she reports having 
taken 50% or more of the prescribed doses in the last 2 weeks. Participants with unacceptable 
adherence will not be stepped up in the same way as those with acceptable adherence. Continuing with 
the same example, since this participant is at control level 3 and assuming he/she has acceptable 
adherence, the study clinician would recommend a 2 -step increase in  therapy (or an increase to Step 5 if 
on Step 4 or maintenance on Step 5 if already on Step 5). In all cases, consideration will be given to a 
burst of prednisone according to the suggestions in the table.

of 16 mg per day.  
Note: Shading in the table corresponds to the example described in the text above.  
 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 34 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 Based on the participant’s step level assigned at the  last E&M visit and the change in steps determined 
above, the new regimen will be prescribed according to Table 7.1.1.2b above. In the example above, if 
the participant were currently on Step 2 and having no problems with adherence, then the 
recommended ne w treatment step based on symptoms, albuterol/levalbuterol use, FEV 1, and 
exacerbations is Step 4.  
7.1.1.3  Final Study Visit  
At the Final Study Visit (12-month Visit) , the final treatment regimen prescribed will be based on the 
protocol -based medications management algorithm or the discretion of the study clinician who 
examines the participant. The study clinician  will base the treatment on factors such as symptoms, 
albuterol use, spirometry, adherence, and the participant’s current level of therapy. The participant’s 
care will then be transferred back to their primary care provider (PCP) and/or asthma specialist.  
7.1.1.4  Asthma Action Plan  
Clinical research staff will provide a written Asthma Action Plan consistent with NAEPP guidelines for the 
participant at all E&M visits . This plan describes a Green, Yellow, and Red Zone for the participant based 
on his/her symptoms. In the Green Zone, the participant has no symptoms of an a sthma episode and is 
directed to use his/her usual asthma medications. In the Yellow Zone, the participant is experiencing 
asthma, allergy, or cold symptoms, and is directed to increase rescue medication use until the symptoms 
have been resolved. In the Re d Zone, the participant is having persistent symptoms that cannot be 
controlled. The participant is instructed to contact a study clinician  or go to the emergency department 
(ED) if unable to contact a study clinician.  
7.1.1.5  Asthma Education  
As part of the meeti ng at E&M visits with a clinical research staff member for asthma education, 
participants will be educated on topics related to asthma. These topics include background on asthma as 
a disease, use of the Asthma Action Plan (see Section 7.1.1.4 ), adherence t o medications, using 
medications at school (when applicable), and allergen and irritant avoidance. Handouts will be provided 
and the education  content will be tailored to each participant. For example, the allergen avoidance 
education will be based on the participant’s aeroallergen skin test/serum IgE results. The participant will 
receive education about the allergens to which he/she is sensitive. The information contained in the 
handouts will be based on the EPR -3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Manageme nt of Asthma and on 
experience from previous ICAC clinical trials.  
7.1.2  Other permitted concomitant medications  
During the study, after the initial skin  testing,  rhinitis  and asthma medications will be permitted along 
with other maintenance medications, aside  from those excluded in Section 4.3, Exclusion Criteria .  Short 
courses of oral corticosteroids or dose s of greater than 500 mcg of fluticasone per day or the equivalent 
of another inhaled corticosteroid may be used short -term (not to exceed 6 months) to control an 
asthma exacerbation.   
7.2 Prophylactic Medications  
Pre-treatment with antihistamines can be used before immunotherapy injection at the study clinician’s 
discretion.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 35 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 7.3 Prohibited Medications  
1. A regular dose of greater than 500 mcg of fluticasone per day  or the equivalent of  another 
inhaled corticosteroid  for a duration of ≥ 6 months  
2. Allergen immunotherapy  (SLIT or SCIT)  
3. Biologic therapies (e.g., anti -IgE, anti -IL-4, anti -IL-5)  
4. Tricyclic antidepressants  
5. Beta-adrenergic blocke r drugs (both oral and topic al) 
6. Any investigational drug  
7.4 Rescue Medications  
Participants may use antihistamines as needed for large local reactions to the injections.   
Participants may use antihistamines and/or a nasal steroid as needed for persistent nasal and/or ocular 
symptoms  following the NAC . If at any time during the NAC a participant experiences asthma  symptoms  
or anaphylaxis,  treatment with inhaled short -acting bronchodilators , corticosteroids and epinephrine 
will be immediately available  to treat the reaction . Participants will be instructed to bring an albuterol 
inhaler to any visit in which a NAC will be performed and carry it with them for the first 24 hours after 
the NAC . Participants who do not bring an albuterol inhaler to a NAC visit will be provided one.  
7.4.1 Definition and Management of Acute Exacerbations  
Consistent with NAEPP 2007 guidelines, study clinicians caring for participants in the Protocol ICAC -28 
CRITICAL study will start a course of corticosteroids for severe and/or unresponsive exacerbations of 
asthma. For the purposes of the proposed analyses, an asthma exacerbation is defined as a prescription 
of a course of systemic steroids by a clinician or initiation of a course of systemic steroids by a 
participant or a hospitalization to prevent a serious  asthma outcome. If a participant initiates and 
completes a course of systemic steroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if 
the study clinician agrees the treatment was warranted and it meets the following dosage: the course 
for prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone will be at least 20 mg daily for 3 of 5 consecutive 
days. The course for dexamethasone will be a single daily dose. Study clinicians will strongly consider 
initiation of corticosteroids if:  
• Albuterol is needed by inhaler (with or without a spacer) or by nebulization for more than 6 
individual treatments in 24 hours; or  
• Moderate -severe wheeze, cough, shortness of breath, and/or chest tightness or pain occurs for 
at least 5 of the preceding 7 days; or  
• Symptoms of wheeze, cough, shortness of breath, and/or chest tightness or pain severe enough 
to place a participant in his or her “Red Zone” on their Asthma Action Plan (see Section 7.1.1.4) 
do not significantly improve after 3 doses of albuterol. (In su ch situations, in addition to the 
initiation of oral corticosteroids, the study clinician should consider directing the participant to 
the nearest ED.); or  
• There is an unscheduled visit for acute asthma care requiring repeated doses of albuterol 
(clinic ian office, urgent care, ED); or  
• Hospitalization is needed for asthma.  
Permissible drugs for systemic corticosteroid treatment of asthma exacerbations include:  prednisone, 
prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone. The course for prednisone, pr ednisolone, or 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 36 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 methylprednisolone will be 2 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose for 4 days with a maximum dose of 60 mg 
per day. The course for dexamethasone will be 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose for 2 days 
with a maximum dose of 16 mg per day.  Failure to respond to initial treatment will result in additional  
evaluation and possible hospitalization for further management.  This management approach has been 
applied to previous ICAC clinical trials and is consistent with asthma specialist usual care  practices.  
8 Study Procedures  
Detailed instructions for all procedures are provided in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP.  Please see Appendix 
B for information regarding institutional or ICAC -wide restrictions  on study activities due to COVID -19.  
8.1 Study Assessments  
8.1.1 Vital Signs and Growth Parameters  
The following vital signs and growth parameters will be collected at all E&M  visits  unless otherwise 
noted:  
• Weight in kilograms  
• Height (using a calibrated stadiometer) at all visits when spirometry is performed  
• Pulse rat e 
• Respiratory rate  
• Blood pressure  
• Chest a uscultation ,  
• Influenza vaccine - All participants will be recommended  to receive an annual flu vaccine.  
8.1.2 Medical History and Physical Examination  
The participant’s medical history will be obtained and a study clinician will perform a physical 
examination at the Screening Visit . A chest auscultation and current asthma symptom assessment will 
be performed at all injection visits. An abbreviated physic al examination will be performed at all E&M 
visits. Additional examinations may be completed at the study clinician’s discretion.  
Significant findings that are present prior to the start of the study must be included on the appropriate 
case report form (CRF). Significant findings that meet the definition of an adverse event (AE) must also 
be recorded on the AE form.  
If the participant is currently having an asthma exacerbation or other symptoms that the study nurse or 
study clinician feel may compromise the participant’s ability to complete the study procedures safely, a 
physical exam may be performed , and the study visit may be rescheduled. If the study clinician observes 
any AEs during the study visit, a targeted physical exam may be performed. Addition al details regarding 
AE assessment are outlined in Section 12, Safety Monitoring and Reporting.  
8.1.3 Aeroallergen Skin Testing  
The participant’s atopic status will be assessed with skin prick tests to assess allergy to dust mites, 
cockroaches and other aeroalle rgens  relevant to an urban environment and the local area . Participants 
will be asked to stop taking antihistamines for 5 days prior to the visit at which the skin test is performed 
to limit interference with the results of the skin test.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 37 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 Skin testing will  be done by the prick technique using the GreerPick system ( Stallergenes Greer; Lenoir, 
NC). Testing will be performed by certified clinical research staff according to the instructions in the 
Protocol ICAC -28 MOP. Tests will be read after 15 minutes by me asuring the wheal  for each antigen and 
for the controls.  
Acceptable skin testing completed as part of a participant’s participation in other ICAC protocols within 
12 months will meet the requirement for this procedure. In this situation, the skin testing r esults 
documentation from the previous study will be added to the participant’s study file, and the skin testing 
procedure will not be repeated , with the exception of the German cockroach test for study eligibility . 
8.1.4 Measurement of Pulmonary Function  
Spirom etry will be conducted following the ATS and European Respiratory Society guidelines. For 
children under 8 years of age, ATS Preschool Guidelines will be used for spirometry acceptance 
evaluation. This procedure has been successfully implemented in previou s DAIT NIAID -sponsored ICAC 
trials. Details regarding pulmonary function testing (PFT) are provided in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP. All 
PFTs will be performed by certified clinical research staff.  
Peak flow will be measured with the participant sitting uprigh t in a chair  as described in the Protocol 
ICAC -28 MOP .  
8.1.5 Nasal Allergen Challenge  
The NAC  must be rescheduled if the participant meets the following criteria:  
 Has uncontrolled asthma at the time of the NAC , as defined by an FEV 1 < 80% predicted  or an 
ACT score < 20.  
 Has active rhinitis symptoms at the time of  the NAC , defined as a Baseline TNSS >  3, or any  
individual symptom score >  1. 
 Is currently using  oral or nasal antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, nasal decongestants, nasal 
anticholiner gics, biologic therapies, prednisone,  or cromolyn, which cannot be suspended for 
the required washout periods.  
Baseline p eak flow (PEF) and TNSS will be measured before the start of the challenge.  Nasal lavage will 
be performed as described in Section 8.1 .6.  
Increasing doses of allergen will be administered in defined time intervals (every 10-20 minutes) up to a 
specified maximum dose or symptom level,  will be given as described in an accompanying MOP for 
Protocol ICAC -28. Briefly, one spray (100mcL) of d iluent or diluted allergen solution is applied to each of 
the participant’s nostrils using a nasal drug delivery system  (LMA/Teleflex, San Diego, CA)  while the 
participant breath -holds at TLC. After the dose is delivered, the participant is asked to exhale  through 
the nose and then to avoid sniffing or swallowing in the immediate 1 minute after application. For the 
baseline NAC, t he challenge will begin with a 0 mcg/ml  of Bla g 1 [negative control – 50% glycerin, 50% 
COCAS with 0.2% phenol  (Stallergenes Gre er, Lenoir, NC )] dose followed by up to 8 doses of increasing 
concentration, until the participant reaches a TNSS of 6 or more, has a sneezing score of 3 , or their 
symptoms become intolerable. Collection of TNSS and PEF will be  done  10 minutes after each diluent or 
allergen dose is administered.   
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 38 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 The follow -up challe nge at 12 months will be performed as described above, except the challenge will 
continue  until the participant reaches  at least  the dose that elicited a positive response a t the baseline 
NAC or the participant reaches a TNSS of 12 or their symptoms become intolerable.  If a participant 
reaches the dose that elicited a positive response at the baseline NAC without having  a TNSS of 6 or 
more or a sneezing score of 3 , dosing wi ll continue until the participant reaches a TNSS of 6 or more, has 
a sneezing score of 3, or symptoms become intolerable.  
If a participant begins exhibiting asthma symptoms during the NAC, or the PEF is reduced by more than 
20% from baseline, the challeng e will be suspended, and the participant will be evaluated by the study 
clinician. If it is determined treatment is needed based on clinical judgment, then the challenge will not 
be continued.  In the absence of an immediate need for treatment, spirometry will be performed to 
confirm a change in lung function. If the FEV 1 is < 85% of baseline value, the challenge will be stopped. If 
spirometry is performed because of a low PEF and the FEV 1 is ≥ 85% of baseline value, the challenge can 
continue at the clinic ian’s discretion.   
The day after the NAC is performed , the participant will receive a follow -up phone call to assess if he or 
she is experiencing any late -onset respiratory symptoms.  Participant s will be given the peak flow meter 
they used during the chall enge and will be asked to record two PEF measurements, one 4 -8 hours  after 
the completion of the challenge and one 24 hours after the completion of the challenge (or as soon as 
possible after the school day, if applicable). AEs and concomitant medications  will also be assessed . 
Participants who report significant asthma symptoms will receive additional  follow -up to assess safety .  
For further details, please refer to the Investigat or Brochure for German Cockroach  Allergenic Extract for 
Nasal Allergen Challenge.  
8.1.6 Nasal Lavage  
Each NAC  will accompanied  by collection  of nasal lavage samples . Samples will be collected prior to the 
challenge and approximately 3 hours  from initiation of the challenge  as specified in the Protocol ICAC -28 
MOP . Nasal lavage samples will be collected by instilling preservative -free buffered saline into the 
nostrils and allowing fluid to return passively into collection vessels . If the nostrils are occluded, a nasal 
decongestant may be adminis tered at the discretion of the study clinician. Samples will be split and 
processed for both cell differentials and RNA extraction. Site clinical research staff who are trained, 
study -authorized, and certified will perform the nasal lavage and processing p rocedure as specified in 
the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP.  
8.1.7 Dust Sample Collection  
The caretaker or participant will be given a dust collection kit, which includes instructions on how to 
collect a dust sample (Refer to the MOP for Protocol ICAC -28 for detailed inst ructions). A combined dust 
sample from the participant's bed and the participant's bedroom floor will be collected. The room where 
the participant sleeps most nights will be considered the participant's bedroom. Measuring templates 
will be used to delineat e the areas to be vacuumed. Dust will be collected using a vacuum cleaner with a 
special dust collection filter attached. The dust collector will be placed into a sealable plastic bag and 
returned to the study center for temporary storage (frozen). Crude s amples will be batched and shipped 
to a central laboratory by express mail for sieving, extraction, and analysis. The dust specimens will be 
assayed to measure the concentration  of cockroach  allergens such as: Bla g 1, Bla g 2,  and Bla g 5 . 
Additional alle rgens of interest and markers of fungal and microbial exposure may be measured.  In 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 39 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 addition, the caretaker/participant will complete a dust collection questionnaire, which will be returned 
with the dust sample . 
The caretaker or participant will be given the dust collection kit at the Randomization  Visit and will be 
asked to return the dust sample and questionnaire either by mail or by bringing it to the next visit.  
8.1.8 Questionnaire Assessments  
Questionnaires admini stered by site staff will collect inclusion/exclusion criteria information, participant 
contact information, demographic characteristics, asthma and allergy history and medication use, 
asthma exacerbation history, asthma symptoms and health care utilizatio n, concomitant medications, 
and AE information.  
8.2 Clinical and Research Laboratory Evaluations and Specimen Collection  
8.2.1 Blood Sample Collection  
Whole blood will be collected by venipuncture at Screening to determine eligibility. Blood collected prior 
to Randomization  and at 12 months of treatment will be tested fo r assessment of biomarkers of allergen 
immunotherapy, such as cockroach -specific  IgE and IgG 4 antibodies . Mechanistic studies are described 
in Section 9.  
8.2.2 Urine Pregnancy Testing  
All females who h ave reached menarche will be required to have a urine pregnancy test before 
completing study activities  at Screening , Randomization, 12-month  visit, visits where the NAC  is 
performed , monthl y during the escalation phase, and at each Evaluation and Manageme nt Visit (E&M)  
during maintenance . Results of all pregnancy tests will be given to the participant or caretaker as per 
site-specific guidelines and relevant state laws.  
8.3 Recruitment  
The study center may use any IRB -approved means to identify potential parti cipants. Examples include 
hospital, clinic, or emergency department admission records; investigators’ specialty clinic records; and 
advertising (in public locations and on the radio). Potential participants will be screened and recruited 
using a standardiz ed questionnaire that collects contact information and inclusion/exclusion criteria 
information. Participants may be recruited by phone or in person.  
Retention methods involve a number of different approaches.  We will use an appointment reminder 
system th at consists of phone calls several days and one day prior to scheduled appointments for 
confirmation. To facilitate telephone contact with subjects whose phone service may change during the 
study, up to three telephone contact numbers (relatives, neighbors , friends) will be collected for each 
subject.  This has proven to be an effective strategy in previous  DAIT NIAID -sponsored  ICAC studies. 
Those who have no obvious characteristics making them ineligible and who are interested will be invited 
to the clinic  for a Screening Visit.  
8.4 Screening  Procedures  
8.4.1 Screening  Eligibility  Visit  
This research study will be explained in lay terms to the parent/legal guardian of each potential research 
participant. Written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 40 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 authorization will be obtained from all parents/legal guardians at the beginning of this visit  and before 
the child undergoes any screening study procedures . Children  (age dependent on local IRB guidelines)  
will sign a written a ssent form. When  the informed consent has been signed, the participant is 
considered enrolled in the study and will be assigned a unique participant number . Study procedures 
will be stopped and the participant will be deemed ineligible for the study at any  point during the 
Screening Visit if and when they fail to meet eligibility criteria.   
After the consent  (and assent, if applicable) is signed , participants will undergo screening study 
procedures, including prick skin tests with German cockroach to ensure  participants are sensitive to the 
test product, since those who do not react to German cockroach are excluded from the remainder of the 
study. In addition, participants will undergo p rick skin tests to a panel of allergens detailed in the  MOP  
for Protocol  ICAC -28 to characterize the study population . Participants will not need additional skin 
testing if they have a positive skin test result using the same lot of non -standardized German cockroach 
extract used for Protocol ICAC -28 immunotherapy within the pr evious year.  If a different German 
cockroach extract was used for skin testing, the participant will have a repeat skin test of German 
cockroach, histamine, and diluent control to confirm eligibility.  
A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all femal e participants  that have reached menarche . A 
medical history will also be taken and a physical examination will be performed to verify the 
participant’s suitability for inclusion in the study. Participants  will be encouraged to receive  a flu vaccine  
during each flu season.   
Spirometry will be performed by all participants to verify the participant’s suitability for inclusion in the 
study.  
For participants with a positive skin prick test to cockroach, b lood will be collected by venipuncture for 
cockro ach-specific  IgE antibody testing  to determine study eligibility .  Participants who have valid IgE 
test results within the previous year under another ICAC protocol will not need to be re -tested.   
The study clinician will assign  the participant to  the appr opriate asthma treatment step based on the 
participant’s current asthma medications and symptoms according to the treatment algorithm (see 
Section 7.1.1.1), write an appropriate prescription, and provide an asthma action plan (see Section 
7.1.1.4). Partici pants will receive basic asthma education (see Section 7.1.1.5).  
8.4.2 Screening Nasal Allergen Challenge  
The NAC will be performed  on all participants . The NAC can be performed as part of a separately 
scheduled visit , if necessary .  
Each NAC will be accompanied  by collection  of nasal lavage samples. Samples will be collected prior to 
the challenge and approximately 3 hours from initiation of the challenge as described in Section 8.1.6 
and the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP.  
A urine pregnancy test will also be performed o n all female participants  that have reached menarche . 
Blood samples will be collected prior to the NAC  for mechanistic studies (see Section 9). B lood will also 
be evaluated  for baseline assessment of biomarkers of allergen immunotherapy, such as cockroach -

ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 specific  IgE and IgG 4 antibodies. Total IgE and specific IgE to a panel of additional allergens detailed in 
the Protocol  ICAC -28 MOP will also be measured.  
Participants who have :  
 a positive German cockroach skin prick test,  
 German cockroach -specific  IgE ≥0.35 kU A/L,  
 reached the TNNS of  ≥ 6 or a sneeze score of 3  at doses 2 -9,  
 FEV 1 is at least 80% of predicted normal , and  
 an Asthma Control Test/Childhood Asthma Control Test score ≥ 20 
are considered eligible for the study, and at the discretion of t he study clinician , will be invited to 
proceed to Randomization . 
Candidates whose FEV 1 is less than 80% of predicted normal or with a n Asthma Control Test/ Childhood 
Asthma Control Test score  20 will enter a run -in period, as described in Section 8. 4.3 below.  
Participants may also qualify for rescreening if they are ineligible due to reversible illness if their 
condition improves while recruitment is ongoing.  
8.4.3 Asthma Control Optional Visits  
Participants whose FEV 1 is less than 80% of predicted normal  or whose Asthma Control Test/ Childhood 
Asthma Control Test score is  20 may have their asthma managed by a study clinician for up to four 
months in an attempt to get their asthma under control. Participants will return to the clinic for visits 
approximately  every two weeks to report on their asthma symptoms and medication use , and have their 
medication adjusted if indicated. When control has been established based on the Asthma Control 
Test/Childhood Asthma Control Test , the participant may proceed in the stu dy. If control cannot be 
established, the participant’s care will then be transferred back to their primary care provider (PCP) 
and/or asthma specialist. The participant will be provided with a summary of their treatment plan , 
which can be shared with thei r PCP.  
8.5 Randomization  
At randomization , the study clinician will review all inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm  the 
participant ’s eligibility . Blood will be drawn , if needed,  for tests described in Section 8.4.2. A dust sample 
collection kit will be  provided (see Section 8.1.7).  
The study clinician will adjust the participant’s asthma medications as necessary according to the 
treatment algorithm (see Section 7.1.1.2), write an appropriate prescription, and provide a new asthma 
action plan (see Sectio n 7.1.1.4). Participants will receive basic asthma education (see Section 7.1.1.5).  
Study participants will be randomized (see Section 13.3) to one of two groups: 1) cockroach SCIT or  2) 
placebo  SCIT (1:1) .  
8.6 Follow -up 
8.6.1 SCIT Dose Escalation  
The dose escalation of glycerinated German cockroach allergenic e xtract  or placebo is detailed in the 
Dose  Escalation  Table 8.6.1. Each injection will be administered by the trained research staff  under the 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 42 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 supervision of the study clinician along with any rescue m edications, as required . Refer to the ICAC -28 
Reaction Orders  on handling treatment -related reactions.  
During the dose escalation phase, all females who have reached menarche will be required to have a 
urine pregnancy test monthly .  
Prior to the administration of each dose of allergenic extract  or placebo , pre-assessment  will be 
completed to  assess the eligibility of the  participant to receive the allergenic extract injection .  
Post -assessment of p articipants , 30 minutes after each injection , will be completed for symptoms  or 
changes .   
During all dosing visits, a study clinician  and appropriate emergency supplies will be readily available to 
treat any adverse reactions.   
Participants will receive weekly injections during escalation (Table 8. 6.1). From Dose 1 through Dose 20, 
injections must be separated by a minimum of 2 days. From Dose 21 through Dose 26, injections must 
be separated by a minimum of 5 days. To maximize flexibility  during dose escalation , injections can be 
given once weekly, a nd can be delayed at any point if there are systemic reactions,  local reactions or 
other concerns . To continue on to maintenance , each subject will need to reach the minimum 
maintenance  dose in a maximum of 40 weeks  (see Appendix B: Study Restrictions Due to COVID -19).   
Dose escalation will be conducted by the following schedule(s):  
  Table 8. 6.1 SCIT Dose Escalation  
All participants will start SCIT with Dose 1. Doses -1 and -2 are included for participants who 
experience a reaction at Doses 1 or 2 that require dosage reductions.

Dose escalation will continue according to the schedule unless there are lapses in dosing or reactions 
occur.  Dosing modifications as a result of reaction or lapse in dosing during dose escalation are detailed 
in the  MOP for Protocol ICAC -28.  
Participants who are unable to reach the minimum maintenance  dose (the highest volume of the 1:10 
concentration; Dose 20 in Table 8. 6.1) by 40 weeks following the start of dose escalation  will be unable 
to proceed to the mainten ance period  and will have their study therapy stopped  (see Section  11.2 .1; see 
Appendix B Study Restrictions Due to COVID -19).  
8.6.2 Maintenance Visits  
Participants who  have completed  dose escalatio n will receive one injection of investigational agent 
every 2 weeks  for 3 doses, followed by maintenance injections every 4 weeks to complete a maximum 
of 12 months of treatment .  
During the maintenance phase, a  urine pregnancy test will be performed at the E&M visits (every two 
months) on all female participants  that have reached menarche . 
Dosing modifications as a result of reaction or lapse in dosing for the three , initial , maintenance -level 
injections, planned at two week intervals , are detailed in the MOP for Protocol ICAC -28. Additionally, 
dosing modificatio ns as a result of reaction or lapse in dosing  for the subsequent maintenance level 
injections planned at four -week  intervals are detailed in the MOP for Protocol ICAC -28.  
Participants will be instructed to immediately report any severe sign or symptom pos sibly related to the 
subcutaneous administration of the investigational agent and to contact the study site when they need 
medical advice. At each visit, participants will be queried regarding any delayed reactions or side effects 
experienced . For those pa rticipants with asthma, exacerbations will be handled through an approach 
consistent with standard clinical practice as described in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP.  
8.7 Asthma Evaluation and Management (E&M) Visits  
Every two months, an asthma E&M process will occur  where participants’ asthma medication regimen 
will be adjusted based on symptoms, albuterol/levalbuterol use, FEV 1, recent exacerbations, and their 
current level of therapy (see Section 7.1.1.2).  At these visits,  asthma and rhinitis endpoints, including 
the CASI (see Section  3) will also be measured.   The E&M Visits will include:  
 Pregnancy test (post -menarcheal females)  
 Physical exam and AE assessment  
 Vital signs, with height and weight  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 44 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
  Spirometry and peak flow  
 CASI and other symptom measurements  
 Assignm ent of asthma medication regimen by study clinician (see Section 7.1.1)  
 Asthma education/counseling (see Section 7.1.1.5)  
8.8 12-Month  Visit  
The 12 -Month Visit is the final visit and will include:  
 Pregnancy test ( post -menarcheal females)  
 Final  physical  exam  and AE assessment  
 Vital sign s, with height and weight  
 Blood  draw  
 Allergen skin test for German cockroach  
 Spirometry  and peak flow  
 CASI and other symptom measurements  
 Targeted pulmonary exam  
 NAC  
 Nasal lavage , before and after NAC  
8.9 Early Termination  Visit   
Participants who withdraw from the study or  are dropped from the study will be invited to the study 
center for an Early Termination Visit  as specified in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP . The Early Termination 
Visit  can include:  
 Pregnancy test ( post -menarch eal fema les) 
 Final  physical  exam  and AE assessment  
 Vital sign s, with height and weight  
 Blood  draw   
 Allergen skin test for German cockroach  
 Spirometry  and peak flow  
 CASI and other symptom measurements  
Procedures contraindicated by the medical condition of the parti cipant will not be conducted at the 
discretion of the study clinician. For participants who refuse or are unable to come to the clinic, the final 
clinical assessment as described above may be conducted over the phone. Besides this visit, no further 
follow -up will be made, except for participants who are discontinued due to pregnancy or SAEs. These 
participants will be contacted to determine the outcome of the pregnancy or the SAE. Refer to Section 
12.6 , Pregnancy Reporting , for more information on AE report ing for pregnancy . 
8.10 Unscheduled Visits  
Participants who experience asthma -related problems (not requiring emergency room care) or concerns 
between scheduled study visits will be seen by a study clinician as warranted by the situation. If the site 
staff are notified by the participant, his/her family, an ED, a hospital, or clinic that the participant was 
seen for an unscheduled visit elsewhere, the site staff will contact the participant within 2 weeks of 
discharge to obtain an update on the participant’s cl inical status.  A follow -up visit at the study center 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 45 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 will be scheduled if needed. For details on the management plan, please refer to Section 7. 1.1 and the 
Protocol ICAC -28 MOP.  
Participants who are at Control Level 4 at a study visit will either be seen in the clinic or will receive a 
follow -up phone call within 1 -2 weeks of the visit to check the status of their symptoms.   
Participant s who have  2 exacerbations within a 1 -month period must be seen in a face -to-face visit to 
determine if continuation in the study is in the best interest of the participant.  
8.11 Visit Windows  
During dose escalation, 1 -2 injections will be given each week separated by at least 2 days. Dose 
escalation mus t be completed  over a maximum of 40 weeks  (See Appendix B: Study Restrictions Due to 
COVID -19). Bi-weekly and monthly m aintenance injections should be scheduled as close as possible to 
the every 2 -week or every -4-week  target date s.  
See the  Protocol  ICAC -28 MOP for details regarding visit scheduling  and Appendix A for the Table of 
Events . 
9 Mechanistic Assays  
Exploratory objectives will be addressed using mechanistic assays to evaluate biological responses to CR 
immunotherapy. Detailed descriptions of the methodology for bio logical sample collection and 
processing and for assay implementation are described in the ICAC -28 MOP and in separate mechanistic 
study proposals.  
Whole blood will be collected by venipuncture according to the visit activity schedule ( see Appendix A) 
prior to  Randomization  and at the 12 -Month Visit or the Early Termination Visit . Nasal lavage samples  
will be collected prior to each NAC  and at approximately 3 hours  after the initiation of  each NAC .  
9.1 Antibody Assays  
Serum processed from study blood draws will be tested for biomarkers of allergen immunotherapy, such 
as cockroach -specific  IgE and IgG4 antibodies to cockroach component allergens. These include, but may 
not be limited to , Bla g 1, Bla g 2, Bla g 4, Bla g 5 and Per a 7.   
Serum  from these blood draws will also be used to measure in -vitro cockroach antigen binding to B -
cells.  
9.2 Cellular Assays  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be separated from study blood draws and used to 
measure the magnitude and phenotype of the CR-specific T cell response to CR immunotherapy.  
9.3 Gene Expression  
Blood drawn at each study blood draw will be used to extract RNA samples for whole transcriptome RNA 
sequencing to identify the changes in PBMC  gene expression  response to CR stimulation over  time  and 
compare those changes  between the treated group and the untreated group. Significant differences will 
allow the identif ication of  mechanisms of immune tolerance in CR  SCIT . 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 46 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 Nasal lavage samples collected before and after each  NAC will be used to compare gene expression  by 
RNA -sequencing  in nasal lavage samples pre -CR NAC  with samples post -CR NAC . Samples collected at  12 
months  will be used to identify  the changes in nasal lavage gene expression in response to CR 
immunotherapy between the treated group and the untreated group.  
10 Biospecimen  Storage  
Unused samples of biological specimens collected during the course of the study will be stored 
(described in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP) for future use for tests that may or may not be pl anned. These 
tests may or may not be related to the study of asthma and allergy  and may include genetic studies such 
as DNA . Participants will be asked to give permission for long -term storage and future use during the 
consent process.   With the participan t’s approval and as approved by the central IRB, de -identified 
biological samples will be stored indefinitely at the DAIT NIAID central repository (Eminent  Services 
Corporation, Frederick, MD ).

 Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E -6: Guideline for Good Clin ical 
Practice,  21CFR Parts 312 and 320, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version [enter 4.0 or correct version 
applicable to trial ] : http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
12.2 Definitions  
12.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s participation in the 
research, whether or not con sidered related to the subject’s participation in the research (modified 
from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmoni sation E -6 
Guideline s for Good Clinical Practice) (f rom OHRP "Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Other s and Adverse Events (1/15/07)"  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2  )  
The following are  adverse event s associ ated with  study therapy and study procedures :   
 Study therapy regimen : German cockroach allergenic extract administered by the subcutaneous 
route  
 Local Injection site reaction which requires a change in SCIT dose  
 Systemic reactions such as, but not limited to, those listed below:  
 Eye symptoms (itchy, runny, swelling)  
 Nose symptoms (sneezing, itching, runny, stuffy)  
 Mouth/ears/throat symptoms (itchy mouth, throat irritation, oral or throat angioedema, 
cough, itchy ears)  
 Skin symptoms other than local injection site reactions (angioedema, urticaria, 
generalized itching, rash)  
 Gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, nausea)  
 Chest ( cough , tightness, wheezing)  
 Anaphylaxis  (see Table 12.3.1.1 b) 
 Study  procedures : AEs that occur due to a study procedure will be collected and recorded. The 
following clinical situations, when associated with study procedures, are defined as adverse events 
and will be recorded on the AE eCRF.   
Blood Draws  
 Fainting/Vasovagal events  
 Bruising at puncture site larger than 2 cm diameter  
 Bleeding from puncture site lasting more than 30 minutes  
 Swelling at puncture site larger than 2 cm

minutes from  the procedure  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 49 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
  Coughing requiring treatment with bronchodilators within 30 minutes from  the 
procedure  
Nasal Allergen Challenge  
• Any clinical response requiring medication (s ee table 12.3.1 .1a) 
Allergen Skin Testing  
 Prolonged (> 24 hours) itching at  test site 
 Swelling (>  10 cm) at site of test  lasting  more  than 24 hours  
 Nasal allergic symptoms  within 30 minutes of the procedure  
 Fainting/vasovagal event  within 30 minutes  of the procedure  
 Anaphylaxis  
12.2.2  Suspected Adverse  Reaction (SAR)  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational drug [or 
investigational study therapy regimen] caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to sugges t a causal relationship between the drug and 
the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
12.2.3  Unexpected Adverse E vent  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction  (SAR)  is considered “unexpected”  when its nature 
(specificity), or severity, or rate of occurrence is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
general investigational plan or elsewhere i n the IND.  
 “Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties 
of the drug,  but are not specifically me ntioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation 
(21 CFR 312.32(a) ). 
12.2.4  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the DAIT/NIAID  Medical Mo nitor , it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 
312.32(a)):  
1. Death.  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Principal I nvestigator or IND Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disr uption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening , or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 50 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above.  
Exacerbations of asthma are o rdinary, anticipated complications of asthma observed in patients 
receiving standard of care. An asthma exacerbation that requires hospitalization and is determined to be 
a SAR (Section 12.2.1.1 ) will be considered a SAE . All other asthma hospitalizations will not be 
considered SAEs and will be entered only on the appropriate CRFs. The date of onset of the SAE will be 
the date of hospital admission and the date of resolution will be the discharge date. The underlying 
condition will be followed as per protoc ol. 
12.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E -6: Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice;  and 
applies the standards:

 Table 12.3.1.1 b Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis  
All anaphylaxis events , regardless of severity grade, and other systemic reactions will be recorded as 
Adverse Events  and will be graded according to Table 12.3.1.1 c World Allergy Organization 
Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Systemic Reaction Grading System .9 
  Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled : 
1) Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, p ruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  
a) Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reducted PEF, 
hypoxemia  
b) Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence)  
2) Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely  allergen for that 
patient  (minutes to several hours):  
a) Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -
tongue -uvula)  
b) Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reducted PEF, 
hypoxemia)  
c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pai n, vomiting)  
3) Reduced BP after exposure to known  allergen for that patient  (minutes or several hours):  
a) Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic 
BP* 
b) Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater tha n 30% decrease from that person’s 
baseline  
PEF, Peak expiratory flow;  BP, blood pressure.  
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 
mm Hg + [2 x age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

12.3.1.2  Grading and Attribution of All Other Adverse Events  
The study clinician  will grade the severity of other  adverse events experienced by the study participants  
according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse  Events (CTCAE)  Version 4.0.  This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) 
provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to 
articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events. The NCI -CTCAE has been reviewed by the  
Principal Investigators and  has been deemed appropriate for the participant  population to be studied in 
this protocol.  
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI -
CTCAE m anual:  
Grade 1 = mild adverse event  
Grade 2 = moderate adverse event  
Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event  
Grade 4 = life-threatening  or disabling adverse event  
Grade 5 = death  
 
Events Grade 1  or higher will be recorded on the appropriate AE  electronic  case report form for this 
study.

 During the course of the study, to determine if  an abnormal value or a clinical or laboratory evaluation 
(including, but not limited to, a radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram etc.), is an  adverse 
even t will rely on clinical  judgment of the study clinician .  
For additional information and a printable version of the NCI -CTCAE manual, consult the NCI -CTCAE web 
site: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
12.3.2  Attribution Definitions  
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study procedure( s) 
will initially be determined by the study clinician  and recorded on the appropriate AE /SAE eCRF .  Final 
determination of attribution for safety reporting will be determined by DAIT  NIAID.  The relationship of 
an adverse event to study therapy regimen or procedures will be determined using the descriptors and 
definitions provided in Table 12.3.2.

UNRELATED CATEGORY  
1 Unrelated  The adverse event is clearly not related ; there is insufficient 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
RELATED CATEGORIES  
2 Possible  The adverse event has a reasonable possibility  to be related; 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
3 Definite  The adverse event is clearly related.  
 
12.4 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
12.4.1  Collection Period  
Adverse events  (including SAEs)  will be collected from the time of consent until 30 days after a 
participant completes study participation or until 30 days after he/she prematurely wit hdraws (without 
withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the study.  
12.4.2  Collecting Adverse Events  
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods:  
 Observing the participant  
 Interviewing the participant   
 Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject  
 In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also 
indicate an adverse  event, as defined in Section 12.3 , Grading and Attribution of Adverse 
Events  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 55 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 12.4.3  Recording Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, the investigator will record adverse events and serious adverse events as 
described previously (Secti on 12.2 , Definitions) on the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF  regardless  of the 
relationship to study therapy regimen or study procedure.  
Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until 30 days 
after the end of study participation, or until 30 days after the subject prematurely withdraws (without 
withdrawing consent)/or is withdrawn from the stu dy, whichever occurs first.  The DAIT NIAID Medical 
Officer may request continued follow -up of an adverse event beyond the stated timeframe if deemed 
clinically important . 
12.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  and Adverse Events  
12.5.1  Reporting of Seri ous Adverse E vents to the IND Sponsor (DAIT/NIAID)  
This section describes the responsibilities of the Principal  Investigator to report serious adverse events 
to the IND sponsor via SAE eCRF. Timely reporting of adverse events is required by 21 CFR and ICH E6 
guidelines .  
Principal  Investigators must  report all serious adverse events (see Section 04, Serious Adverse Event), 
regardless of relationship or expectedness within 24 hour s of becoming aware of  the event.  
For serious adverse events, all requested information on the AE/SAE eCRF  will be provided.  The 
following minimal  criteria must be included in the initial SAE eCRF:  
 AE Term  
 Study Drug Treatment  
 Relationship to study drug  
 Reason why the event is serious  
However, unavailable details of the event will not delay submission of the known information.  As 
additional details become available, the AE/SAE eCRF  will be updated and submitted.  Every time the SAE 
eCRF is submitted, it should be electronically signed by the investigator or sub -investigator.  
12.5.2  Reporting to FDA 
After an adverse event requiring 24 hour reporting (per Section 12.5.1 , Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events to Sponsor) is submitted by the Principal  Investigator and assessed by the IND sponsor ( DAIT  
NIAID ), the IND Sponsor ( DAIT  NIAID ) must  report the adverse event to the FDA using one  of these two 
options : standard reporting (report in the IND annual report ) and expedited safety reporting.  
12.5.2.1  Standard Reporting (Report in the IND Annual Report ) 
This option applies if the AE is classified as  one of the following : 
 Serious, expected, suspect ed a dverse reactions (see Section 12.2.2 , Suspected Adverse 
Reaction, and Section 12.2.3 , Unexpected Adverse Event).  
 Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (see Section 12.2.2 , Suspected Adverse 
Reaction).  
 Pregnancies.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 56 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24 -hour reporting) will be reported in the  IND 
Annual Report . 
12.5.2.2  Expedited Safety Reporting  
This option, with 2 possible categories, applies if the adverse event is classified as one of the following:  
Category 1 :  Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction  [SUSAR]  (see Section 12.2.2, 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR), and Section 12.2.3, Unexpected Adverse Event  and 21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)i).  
The sponsor must  report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  The 
sponsor shall  report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adv erse event, such as:  
1. One or more occu rrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but 
is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
2. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences 
of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur 
in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occ ur more 
frequently in the drug  treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
Category 2: Any findings from studies that suggests a significant human risk  
The sponsor shall  report any findings from other epidemiological studies, analyses of adverse events 
within the cur rent study or pooled analysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro  testing (e.g. 
mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to th e 
drug that would result in a safety -related change in the proto col, informed c onsent, Investigator 
Brochure or Package Insert or other aspects of the overall conduct of the study.   
DAIT  NIAID must  report to  the FDA  and notify all participating investigators of expedited Safety Reports  
within 15 calendar days; unexpec ted fatal or immediately life -threatening suspected adverse reaction(s) 
must  be reported as soon as possible or within 7 calendar days.  
12.5.3  Reporting of Adverse Events to IRBs  
All Principal I nvestigators must  report adverse events, including expedited reports, in a timely fashion to 
the central IRB of record in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines. All IND Safety Reports 
to the FDA shall be distributed by the IND sponsor ( DAIT  NIAID ) or design ee to all participating 
institutions for central  IRB submission.  
12.6 Pregnancy Reporting  
The Principal I nvestigator shall be informed immediately of any pregnancy in a study participant 
occurring from time  of consent through 30 days after the participant compl etes study participation . A 
pregnant participant  shall be instructed to stop taking study medication. The investigator shall counsel 
the participant  and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the 
fetus. Monitoring of  the pregnant participant  shall continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy.   
The investigator shall report to the DAIT  SACCC  and the IND sponsor  (DAIT  NIAID ) all pregnancies within 
1 business day of becoming aware of the event using the Pregnancy  eCRF .  All pregnancies identified 
during the study shall be followed to conclusion  and the outcome of each must be reported. The 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 57 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 Pregnancy eCRF  shall be updated and submitted to the DAIT SACCC  when details about the outcome are 
available.   
Information request ed about the delivery shall  include:  
 Gestational age at delivery  
 Birth weight, length, and head circumference  
 Gender  
 Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) score at 1 minute, 5 minutes, 
and 24 hours after birth, if available  
 Any abno rmalities  
For a ll pregnancy complications that result in a congenital abnormality, birth defect, miscarriage, and 
medically indicated abortion , an SAE shall be submitted to the DAIT SACCC  and the IND sponsor ( DAIT  
NIAID ) using the SAE reporting procedures described above.  
12.7 Reporting of Other Safety Information  
A Principal I nvestigator shall promptly notify the Central IRB as well as the  DAIT  SACCC  and the IND 
sponsor ( DAIT  NIAID ) via email when an “unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others” is 
identified, which is not otherwise reportable as an adverse event.  
12.8 Review of Safety Information  
12.8.1  Medical Monitor Review  
The DAIT  NIAID  Medic al Monitor shall  receive monthly reports from the DAIT SACCC  compiling new and 
accumulating information on major protocol deviations, AEs, SAEs, and pregnancies recorded by the 
study sites  on appropriate e CRFs.  
In addition, the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor shall  review and make decisions on the disposition of the 
SAE and pregnancy reports received by the DAIT SACCC  (See Sections 12.5 and 12.6 ).   
12.8.2  DSMB Review  
12.8.2.1  Planned DSMB Reviews  
NIAID Asthma and Allergy Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) shall  review safety data at least 
yearly during planned DSMB Data  Review Meetings. Data for the planned safety reviews will include, at 
a mini mum, a listing of all reported AEs and SAEs.   
The NIAID Asthma and Allergy DSMB will be informed of an Expedited Safety Report  as determined by 
the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor . An SAE which the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor determines to be an 
unexpected safety risk will be sent to the DSMB immediately.  
12.8.2.2  Ad hoc DSMB Reviews  
In addition to the pre -scheduled data reviews and planned safety monitoring, the NIAID Asthma and 
Allergy DSMB m ay be called upon for ad hoc  reviews. The  NIAID Asthma and Allergy DSMB will review 
any event that potentially impacts safety at the request of the protocol chair or the IND sponsor ( DAIT  
NIAID ). In addition, occurrences described in Section 11.5 Study Sto pping Rules  will trigger an ad hoc 
comprehensive DSMB Safety Review . 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 58 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 After review of the data, the DSMB will make recommendations regarding study conduct and/or 
continuation.  
12.8.2.2.1  Temporary Suspension of enrollment and drug dosing for ad hoc DSMB Safety Review  
A temporary halt in both enrollment and drug dosing will be implemented if an ad hoc DSMB safety 
review is required.  
13 Statistical Considerations and Analytical Plan  
13.1 Overview  
The primary hypothesis to be tested by this study is whether nasal allergen chall enge outcomes , in 
children with persistent, well -controlled asthma, will be affected by subcutaneous treatment with non-
standardized glycerinated German cockroach ( B. germanica ) allergenic  extract.  Major secondary 
hypothes es are that subcutaneous treatment with German cockroach ( B. germanica ) extract can  affect 
asthma severity measures as well as  induce significant changes in immunologic biomarkers indicative of 
desensitization in children with persistent, well -controlled asthma.   
13.2 Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of the study is the average  TNSS (total nasal symptom score)  over the 9 protocol -
defined doses  at the 12 -month NAC. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include other NAC outcomes, 
safety, in vivo and in vitro biomarkers  of immunotherapy , other asthma and rhinitis severity endpoints,  
and key mechanistic parameters .  
13.3 Measures to Minimize Bias  
To minimize bias,  a randomization schedule will be generated by the DAIT SACCC and implemented in a 
validated system that will be used by site personnel to automate the random assignment of treatment 
groups to study participants.   The randomization scheme will be reviewed and approved by a statistician 
at the DAIT SACCC (Rho Federal) and will not be modified thereafter except to accommoda te any 
changes required by amendments  to the protocol.  Participants will be randomized using a 1:1 ratio of 
active (German cockroach (B. germanica ) extract) and control (placebo) participants. Randomiz ation will 
be stratified by site . 
All laboratory assays  for serum IgE and IgG antibodies and other parameters will be performed in a 
central laboratory  by technicians who do not know the participants’ group assignments .  
13.4 Analysis Plan  
13.4.1  Analysis Populations  
The following groups of participants will define samples for endpoint analysis:  
 Modified Intent -to-treat (ITT) sample:  All participants who are randomized , receive d at least one 
dose of study treatment , and receive at least one dose during the 12 -month NAC.  Participants will 
be analyzed according to the  treatment arm to which they were randomized, regardless of the 
medication they actually received.  
 Safety sample: All participants who sign consent and undergo study procedures at Screening . 
Participants will be analyzed according to the medication they ac tually received, regardless of the 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 59 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 treatment arm to which they were randomized. Non-treatment -emergent adverse events (e.g., any 
adverse event that occurs before the first injection) will be summarized in all participants who are 
enrolled, while treatment -emergent  adverse events (e.g., any adverse event that occurs on or after 
the first injection) will be summarized in the safety sample.  
 Per-protocol (PP) sample: All participants who are randomized,  are escalated to 0.4 mL of the 1:10 
maintenance dose,  and receive at least 66% of expected doses of maintenance .  
13.4.2  Primary Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary outcome of the study is the average  TNSS , calculated as the average TNSS over the 
observed doses . The comparison between arms will be conducted using  an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model. The ANCOVA model will include fixed categorical effects for treatment  and baseline 
TNSS score , with adjustment for site. Least square means (LSmeans), SE, LSmeans difference, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and p -value will be presented. Further  details regarding the analyses of the 12 -
month TNSS  will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
13.4.3  Supportive Analyses of the Primary Endpoint  
13.4.3.1  Effects of Cockroach SCIT on TNSS  
Additionally, it will be possible to  compare the responsive dose at the 12 -month NAC (the dose which 
elicits the threshold response of a TNSS ≥  6 or a sneez e score ≥ 3)  at the 12 -month NAC by treatment 
group, using discrete -time (discrete -dose) survival analyses as described by Chinchilli et  al.30 and 
Sampson et al.31 This analysis, which wi ll estimate a hazard ratio, is based on a model for the conditional 
probability of a subject reacting to a given dose, given that the subject has not reacted to previously 
administered doses. Details of right censoring, adjustment for the baseline NAC, imputation for missing 
12-month  NAC observations, and evaluation of the proportional hazards assumption (and analytical 
options when the assumption is not met) will be provided  in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
13.4.3.2  Approaches for Missing Data  
The primary metho d of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of MCMC multiple imputation 
which does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random . After imputing with MCMC, each 
complete data set will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with factors for arm and si te and the respective 
baseline TNSS as a covariate. Lastly, we will c ombine the sets of estimates (and their standard errors) 
generated from different ANCOVA multiply imputed datasets into one set of results.  
13.4.4  Analyses of Secondary and Other Endpoint s 
13.4.4.1  Safet y 
Safety will be summarized by arm in the safety sample by the number and percentage of serious and 
non-serious adverse events stratified by grade and relationship to treatment as well as the number and 
percentage of participants who have a serious and non -serious adverse event stratified by grade and 
relationship to treatment.   
13.4.4.2  German Cockroach -specific IgE and IgG4  
12-months log-transformed German cockroach -specific IgE and IgG4  will also be modeled as ANCOVA 
with factors for treatment arm, site and the respective  log-transformed  baseline as covariate. Similarly, 
Least square means (LSmeans), SE, LSmeans difference, 95% confidence interval (CI) and p -value will be 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 60 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 presented , modeled using a linear mixed model that will include a random intercept and fixed  effects for 
each treatment arm, and an interaction term between treatment arm and time of measurement . 
13.4.5  Analyses of Exploratory Endpoint s 
13.4.5.1  CASI outcome measures  
To account for the correlation among repeated measures within  subject , the eff ect of cockroach SCIT on 
asthma severity will be analyzed using a mixed effect repeated measures model looking at the CASI 
assessment s at 10 and 12 months of treatment .   
The mixed model will include fixed effects for treatment group, baseline CASI score  at rando mization, 
site as well as a within -subject random effects . Treatment group differences will be tested using the F 
statistics from the mixed model with Kenward -Roger degrees of freedom. Least squares estimates of the 
CASI for both of the study arms will be obtained from the model and presented. Ninety -five percent 
confidence intervals for the estimated treatment effect (LS Mean for the German Roach arm – LS Mean 
for the Placebo arm) will also be obtained using the fitted -regression model. The validity of mod el 
assumptions will be explored using regression diagnostics and may include separate models to assess 
possible modification of the treatment effect by CASI or other fixed effects.  
In addition, for each subject, the average CASI overall  assessments will be  computed and summarized by 
treatment group (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum).  For each visit where 
CASI is collected following the first injection of study drug, summary statistics will be presented by 
treatment arm.  
13.4.5.2  Rhinitis severity outcome measures  
The same mixed effect repeated measures model  as used for the CASI outcomes, with the same 
covariates, will be used to examine treatment differences in the secondary rhinitis severity endpoints:  
1. Modified Rhinitis Symptom Utility I ndex  
2. Rhinitis treatment step (medication requirements)  
13.4.5.3  Additional asthma severity outcome measures  
The same mixed effect repeated measures model  as used for the CASI, with the same covariates, will be 
used to examine treatment differences in the additional  asthma severity endpoints:  
1. Number of days with asthma symptoms ( wheezing or tightness in the chest or cough ) 
2. Number of nights with asthma symptoms (waking up because of wheezing or tightness in the 
chest or cough ) 
3. Number of days with albuterol use  
4. Number of nights with albuterol use  
5. Asthma treatment step (medication requirements)  
6. Asthma exacerbations  
7. FEV 1 
13.4.5.4  Mechanistic Endpoints  
For continuous variables with baseline value and one post -baseline measurement  (12-months) , ANCOVA 
will be used, unless specified otherwise. Least square means (LSmeans), SE, LSmeans difference, 95% 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 61 of 69 
 
ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 confidence interval (CI)  and p-value will be presented. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for baseline 
will be performed for the binary variables, and the odds ratio and 95% CI for th e odds ratio of treatment 
group comparisons will be given . 
Analysis plans for other mechanistic endpoints, as described in Section 9, will be detailed in their 
respective mechanistic proposals.   
13.4.6  Descriptive Analyses  
Descriptive analyses will be reported separately for immunotherapy  and placebo arms. Continuous 
baseline measures will be reported 1) means (or geometric means) with 95% confidence intervals, or 2) 
median with first and third quartiles, as appropriate. Categorical baseline and demographic 
char acteristics and study disposition will be reported as frequencies and proportions.

13.6 Sample Size Considerations  
Sample size calculations are based on the primary endpoint of the study , mean TNSS over the 9 
protocol -defined doses  at the 12 -month NAC following the primary analysis , modeled as ANCOVA with 
factors for treatment arm, site and TNSS  baseline as covariate . For sample size calculations  we assumed 
a mean TNSS score of 2.94 for the placebo group with varying effect sizes. A risk reduction of 0.30 is 
obtained as (2.94  – 2.94*(1 -0.3)) / 2.94 = 0.30 and translates into an absolute differenc e of 2.94*0.3 = 
0.88. A mean squared error ( pooled SD) of 1.09 was assumed for these sample sizes calculations.  
Assuming a  risk reduction of 30%, absolute difference of 0.88 an ANCOVA with a total sample size of 54 
participants will provide 83% power for a 2-sided, 0.05 significance  level test .

14 Identification and Access to Source Data  
14.1 Source Data  
Source documents and source data are considered to be the original documentation  where subject 
information, visits consultations, exami nations and other information  are recorded .  Documentation of 
source data is necessary for the reconstruction, evaluation and validation of clinical findings, 
observations and other activities during a clinical trial.   All clinical site laboratory reports,  spirometry 
reports, and any paper and electronic CRFs will be maintained as source data.

ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 14.2 Access to Source Data  
The Principal  Investigators and site staff will make all source data available to the IND sponsor ( DAIT  
NIAID ), as well as to the FDA .  Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain the 
strict confidentiality of medical and research information that may be linked to identified individuals.  
15 Protocol Deviations  
15.1 Protocol Deviation  Definitions  
15.1.1  Protocol  Deviation  
The investiga tors and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the protocol; no deviations from 
the protocol are permitted.  Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures 
constitutes a protocol deviation .  As a result of any deviati on, corrective actions will be developed by the 
site and implemented promptly.  
15.1.2  Major Protocol Deviation  (Protocol Violation )  
A Protocol Violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that may affect the subject's rights, 
safety, or well -being and /or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.   In addition, 
protocol violations include willful or knowing breach es of human subject protection regulations, or 
policies, any action that is inconsistent with the NIH Human Research Protec tion Program’s research, 
medical, and ethical principles , and a serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, local or 
institutional human subject protection regulations, policies, or procedures .  
15.1.3  Non -Major  Protocol Deviation  
A non-major  protoco l deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of a research protocol that does not  have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or 
well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.  
15.2 Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations  
The Principal I nvestigator  has the responsibility to identify, document and report protocol deviations  as 
directed by the study Sponsor .  However, protocol deviations may also be identified during site 
monitoring  visits or during other form s of study conduct review.  
Upon determination that a protocol deviation (major or minor) has occurred, the study staff will a) 
notify the P rincipal Investigator (P I), b) notify the DAIT SACCC, and c) complete the Protocol Devia tion 
form. The Protocol Deviation form will document at a minimum the date  the protocol deviation ( PD) 
occurred, the date PD identified, a description of event , whether the  deviation result ed in SAE/AE, the 
signature of PI, report to IRB, and documentation  of a corrective action plan. The DAIT SACCC and the 
IND sponsor (DAIT NIAID ) may request discussion  with the PI to determine the effect of the protocol 
deviation on the study participant and his/her further study participation, the effect of the protocol 
deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions. The PI will complete and sign the Protocol 
Deviation form and submit it to the DAIT SACCC and to the Central IRB, per IRB regulations.  Major 
protocol deviations will be reviewed by  the DSMB .

 16 Ethica l Considerations and Compliance with Good Clinical Practice  
16.1 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The Principal Investigator is required to keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the study is 
fully documented. The Principal Investigator is req uired to ensure that all CRFs are completed for every 
participant entered in the trial.  
The sponsor is responsible for regular inspection of the conduct of the trial, for verifying adherence to 
the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistenc y, and accuracy of all documented data.  
The CRFs will be completed online via a web -based electronic data capture (EDC) system that has been 
validated and is compliant with Part 11 Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Study staff at the site 
will enter information into the electronic CRFs, and the data will be stored remotely at a central 
database. Data quality will be ensured through the EDC system’s continuous monitoring of data and 
real-time detection and correction of errors. All elements of da ta entry (i.e., time, date, verbatim text, 
and the name of the person performing the data entry) will be recorded in an electronic audit trail to 
allow all changes in the database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal 
regulations.  
16.2 State ment of Compliance  
This clinical study will be conducted using good clinical practice (GCP), as delineated in Guidance for 
Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance , and according to the criteria specified in this 
study protocol.  Before st udy initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be 
reviewed and approved by the IRB.  Any amendments to the protocol or to the consent materials will 
also be approved by the IRB before they are implemented.  
16.3 Informed Consent Process  
The consent process will provide information about the study to a prospective participant and 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and will allow adequate time for review and discussion prior to his/her 
decision.  The Principal Investigator or designee listed on the FDA 1572  will review the consent and 
answer questions. The consent designee must be listed on the delegation log  and have knowledge of the 
study . The prospective participant and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be told  that being in the trial is 
voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.  All participants 
(or their legally acceptable representative) and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will read, sign, and date a 
consent form before  undergoing any study procedures.  Consent materials will be presented in 
participants’ primary language. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the participant.  
Assent will also be obtained from children  with due consideration for age -appropri ate private 
conversations between study  staff member  and participant.  
The consent process will be ongoing.  The consent form will be revised when important new safety 
information is available, the protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes availab le that may 
affect participation in the study.  
16.4 Privacy and Confidentiality  
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each participant will 
be assigned a unique identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used to

 collect, store, and report participant information.  Site personnel will not transmit documents containing 
personal health identifiers (PHI) to the study sponsor or their representatives.  
17 Publication Policy  
Presentations and publicati on of the results of this trial will be governed by the ICAC Publication Policy .

ICAC -28: CRITICAL  5.0  11 Jan 2021  
 Appendix B: Study Restrictions Due to COVID -19 
In the event of institutional or ICAC -wide restrictions on certain types of procedures or certain classes of research, some 
study activities  will be  suspended. This include s certain visits and specific inhalation and nasal procedures, such as:  
 In-person study visits, including injection visits  
 Spirometry  
 Nasal Allergen Challenges  
 Nasal sampling, including nasal lavages  
 Peak Expiratory Flow  
When all in -person  study activities  are suspended, s tudy staff will continue to make contact with study participants over 
the phone  and c linicians will continue to manage the participants’ asthma remotely. Prescriptions  for asthma 
management medications  can be sent to local pharmacies and additional prednis one, if needed, can be mailed to the 
participant.  Should reconsenting be necessary, the consent process will occur remotely.  
Participants whose immunotherapy regimen was halted as a result of study activity restrictions will be asked to resume 
therapy once  the site is able to administer injections. The initial  restart  dose for these participants will be dictated by the 
dose modification rules in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP.  Re-escalation of immunotherap y will follow the rules referenced  
in Section 8.6  and in the Protocol ICAC -28 MOP , taking into account each participant’s total time off therapy and history 
of reactions.  The 40 -week requirement for reaching maintenance will be reset  for participants whose immunotherapy 
was interrupted by the COVID -19 pa ndemic.  
While participants may typically be stepped down from controller medications during the ma intenance phase,  
participants  in this phase who  had their therapy level modified as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic will not be stepped 
down in MEDS treatme nt level until they have successfully re -escalated to their original maintenance dose.

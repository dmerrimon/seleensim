Safety of JointStem, Autologous Adipose Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells, in 
Treatment of Osteoarthritis  
Phase:    Phase 2 
Indication:    Osteoarthritis (Degenerative Arthritis) 
Study Objective:  T o evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem 
cells (A dMSC) for the treatment of osteoarthritis  
 
Study Design:  This study is a  double -blind, randomized, controlled study with two arms to evaluate 
JointStem  as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis . Following a 2 -week screening 
period, approximately 30 subjects  will be randomly assigned into one of the following two 
arms  in a 2:1 ratio (2 JointStem : 1 positive control): 
• JointStem (1x108 cells/3mL)  
• Positive control: Synvisc -One®  
  
After each subject completes 6-month visit (Visit 6 ) and the data management team 
confirms all individual data have no issue, the individual  database will be locked and the 
blinding will be open for the statistical analysis. Only s ubjects  who are randomized to 
JointStem group will then be scheduled for 9-month and 12-month follow -up visits ( Visits 
7 and 8) .   
 Long- term follow -up visit will be conducted  to collect  long-term feedbacks (records of 
medications and treatments) following  2 years after injection for all subjects who complete  
6-month visit and accept the long -term follow -up visit .

 Statistical Analysis :   
1. Co -primary Endpoints  
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 6 of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  Using the following three co -primary efficacy variables, the joint functional improvement of knee joint will be 
evaluated and gatekeeping procedures will be used for these three  hypothesis tests .  
1) Change of WOMAC score from baseline at  Month 6 (JointStem group)  
It will be tested using paired t- test (one -sided test, α=0.05). If change of WOMAC score from baseline at 
Month 6 doesn’t satisfy normal distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed.  
2) Change of VAS score from baselin e at Month 6 (JointStem group)  
It will be tested using paired t -test (one -sided test, α=0.05). If change of VAS score from baseline at Month 
6 doesn’t satisfy normal distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed.  
3) MRI improvement evaluation at Month 6 (Joint Stem group)  
The frequency and percentage of subjects whose final PI evaluation is ‘improvement’ will be calculated 
(validity criteria : 36% ).  
2. Secondary Endpoints  
The comparison of WOMAC score, VAS score, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, KOOS , IKDC and RAND -36 score 
between study and control groups will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (AN COVA)  with factors of treatment 
and baseline  of each variable as a covariate.  
Model -based LS Means of the differences between study and control grou ps along with 95% CI and p- value will be 
provided.  
In addition, t he change of secondary efficacy variables within study group shall be tested using paired t -test. If the 
change of score from baseline at each assessment point doesn’t satisfy  normal distribution , Wilcoxon signed rank test 
will be performed.  
In case of MRI, the frequency and percentage of subjects whose PI evaluation is ‘improvement’ at Month 6 will be calculated. In addition, MRI improvement  evaluation at Month 12 compared to Month 6 will be analyzed using 
McNemar test or Bowker’s test.  
 Safety variables will be summarized descriptively, by treatment group and visit.  
 When at least 15 subjects complete 6 -month visits (Visit 6, Month 6), one unblinded interim analysis can be performed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JointStem without the suspension of subject ’s schedule of assessments . The 
details of this interim analysis will be presented in the statistical analysis plan.  
 All efficacy variables  and the history of treatments and medications, which are measured at a long -term follow -up 
visit (24 months after injection ) will be analyzed between treatment groups to see any long -term effects of JointStem. 
Also, MRI results of long -term follow -up visit will be compared to previous MRI results to see any long -term effects 
of JointStem.

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  2. BACKGROUND AND INDICATION 
 
2.1   What is Osteoarthritis  (Degenerative Arthritis)  
 Osteoarthritis  is a group of mechanical abnormalities involving degradation of joints, including 
articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Symptoms may include joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, 
locking, and sometimes an effusion. When bone surfaces become less well protected by  cartilage, 
bone may be exposed and damaged. As a result of decreased movement secondary to pain, regional 
muscles may atrophy, and ligaments may become more lax .
Wei 2002 , Conaghan 2008  
 Osteoarthritis  is the most common form of arthritis, and the  leading cause of chronic dis ability in 
the United States . It affects  about 27 million people in the United States. Eighty percent of 
Americans develop osteoarthritis by age 65. Twenty -five percent of all patients of osteoarthritis 
visit to primary care physicians in the US. The total cost of osteoarthritis  living with  this disease 
is approximately $5,700 annually per person.
Maetzel  2004 Osteoarthritis costs the US economy nearly 
$128 billion per year in medical care and indirect  expenses,  includi ng lost wages and production. 
As population aging progresses and as more young people start taking up active sports, the size of 
the target patient  group is growing. 
 2.2 Current Treatment for Osteoarthritis  and Their Pitfalls  
 The cartilage is a unique avascular, aneural tissue that has limited capacity of self -repair once  
damaged. Despite ongoing research, treatments to manage the disease remain merely symptom-
relieving , designed  to control pain, and improve function and qualit y of life limiting adverse events. 
An effective treatment for cartilage defects is yet to be discovered.  
 Treatment generally involves a combination  of lifestyle modification, analgesics, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatories, and joint injections with  steroids or hyaluronan (lubricant). If pain becomes 
debilitating, joint replacement surgery may be  used to improve the quality of life, e.g. partial joint 
resurfacing (hip and shoulder), and total joint  replacem ent (hip and knee) .
Conaghan 2008 Although 
various treatments are currently in use,  none of them is to address the root of cause —cartilage 
regeneration. In other words, there has been no cure  for osteoarthritis  till today.  
 As a way of regenerating the damaged or defective cartilage tissue, treatment of localized damage  
to articular cartilage using autologous chondrocytes is currently under review. A few studies are  
marketing this method of treatment named “auto logous chondrocyte transplant” .
Wysocka 2010 , Hahn 2010 
The treatment involves the extraction of healthy cartilage tissue  from the patient which is then 
cultured and transplanted into the damaged site. However, this  treatment requires the extraction of 
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 14  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  chondrocytes directly from the patient and thus causes new  damages in healthy articular cartilage. 
Also, “autologous chondrocyte transplant” cannot be applied to large lesions. Moreover, the effect 
is not satisfactory in patients over 40 years old whose cellular  regeneration is slowed- down due to 
aging.  
 
Thus, autologous chondrocyte transplant is rather limited in the number of cells harvested and their 
activation level and is therefore restricted in terms of  treatment site, severity of the condition, and 
the size of lesion. Generally speaking, there was no thera py available till today to regenerate 
cartilage for adult.  
 2.3   Potential Use  of Stem Cells in Treatment of Osteoarthritis  
 Over the last ten years, great progresses have been made worldwide in the adult stem cell field .
Zuk 
2010 Because of their unlimited capacity for self -renewal and ability to differentiate  into multiple 
lineages, human stem cells are a potentially powerful and revolutiona ry tool for repair  of cartilage 
defects. Among different origins of stem cells, marrow -derived stem cells have been  considered 
as pluripot enty of mesenchymal stem cells and proved being successful in many clinical trials.Jiang 
2002  
 However, marrow -derived stem cells are limited and not quite easy to access. Recently many 
groundbreaking articles have been published  describing new adult stem cell populations from 
many tissues which were not expected to find stem cells, such as skin, liver, digestive epithelium, dental pulp and hair follicles  and the adipose  tissue derived stem cell  has become one of the most 
popular adult stem cell populations bei ng used in the stem cell field . 
 There are many advantages in using AdMSC s than stem cells isolated from other sources. First ly, 
unlike embryonic stem cells, the use of adult AdMSC s in research and therapy is not considered 
to be  controversial as they are derived from adult tissue samples rather than destroyed human 
embryos. Second ly, adipose tissue s represent  an abundant and accessible source of adult stem cells, 
especially  with the  fact that overweight is a common condition in the United States , 68% of the 
American adult  population is considered either overweight or obese. Even for normal body  weight 
persons and most very lean individuals, 5- 20 mL extraction of adipose tissue is not  a problem  at 
all. Compared with marrow -derived stem cells, more people accept collecting stem cells via  
lipoaspirate than bone  marrow punctuation. Thirdly, AdMSC s are true stem cells with the capacity  
of differentiating into multi- lineage mesodermal cells  and possible ectodermal and endodermal  
cells.
Zuk 2010 , Stream 2005  
 
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 15  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  Finally, autologous cells are obtained from the same  individual to whom they wi ll be re -implanted. 
Since the AdMSC s come from the patient’s own body, it  has no incidence of graft -versus-host 
rejection and less possibilities of pathogen transmission due to the donor and recipient being the 
same individual. Moreover, treatments using stem cells do not cause  damage as “autologous 
chondrocyte transplant” would do to healthy artic ular cartilage, as AdMSC  treatment doesn't 
require the harvesting of healthy cartilage tissues from the patients.  
 
2.4   Current Clinical Trials of Treating Oste oarthritis  with Stem Cells  
 There are no clinical trials to date that have been reported in the USA for humans using AdMSC  
to treat  osteoarthritis . Several trials for osteoarthritis  treatment using bone marrow  derived stem 
cells or umbilical cord blood- derived mesenchymal stem cells are currently registered  at the NIH 
clinical trials database. In South Korea, the sponsor completed  Phase I and II clinical trials for 
osteoarthritis treatment with injection of autologous AdMSC s, which was proved as a safe and 
effective way and actually regenerated healthy cartilage tissue .  
 Since there is no therapy available today to regenerate cartilage so to effectively  treat osteoarthritis, 
this clinical research has been planned  in the USA under the strict regulations  required by US FDA 
and IRB, in order to prove the efficacy and safety of AdMSC  in the treatment of  osteoarthritis  joint 
and regeneration of cartilage.

• At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative 
• If, in the investigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the subject’s 
well-being  
• At the specific request of the sponsor 
 
Also, subjects must be withdrawn for the following reasons: 
• A significant violation of the protocol, as determined by the sponsor or the investigator

generally follow lab related exclusion criteria, but a PI can determine the high significance on 
any abnormalities for the safety of subject ) 
• Use of any other investigational drugs (including placebo)  
• Subjects enrolled in the current trial but taking any prohibited medication/therapy stated in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  that, in the investigator’s opinion, will interfere with the study 
outcome.  
• Subject enrolled in the current trial but having a baby  
 If a subject prematurely withdraws from the study, the subject must return to the clinical site for the early  termination visit. In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the electronic 
Case Report Form (eCRF ) and in the subject’s medical records. 
 Contact will be maintained with subjects who are removed due to an adverse event (AE) until it has been resolved or stabilized, and the information will be documented in the eCRF and in the 
subject’s medical records.  
 3.4   Premature Termination of Study / Closure of Center  
 The sponsor has the right to terminate this study, and the investigator/sponsor has the right to close a clinical site, at any time, although this should occur only after consultation between involved 
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 20  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  parties; the IRB must be informed in any case . Should t he clinical site be closed prematurely, all 
study materials (equipment, study medication, etc.) must be returned to the sponsor. 
 This study will discontinue  due to medical or administrative reasons such as:  
• Serious adverse events probably related to study  drug administration so that the use of study 
drug may no longer be justifiable 
• 2 or more deaths are observed during any point in the trial 
• 5 or more adverse drug reactions (NCI -CTCAE ≥ Grade 3) on the injected joint are observed 
during any point in the tr ial 
• Significant change of benefit -risk ratio for the subjects  
• Sponsor discontinues the investigation of JointStem for the treatment of osteoarthritis  or 
determines that the doses being studied are no longer justifiable 
 Possible reasons for closing of a cl inical site include the following:  
• The investigator feels that the number or severity of adverse events is excessive 
• A change of technical, administrative, or personal circumstances occurs and the conduct of the 
study no longer meets ICH-GCP guidelines 
• In case of evident, significant non-compliance to protocol or poor data quality 
 
3.5   Treatment  
 3.5.1 Treatment to be Administered  
 At Visit 2 (Week -5), a  subject, who is qualified  for this study, will be randomized to one of two 
study groups and the adipose tissue will be harvested via liposuction. At Visit 3 (Week 0, baseline), the randomized subject will receive a single intra -articular injection.  
 3.5.2 Identity of Investigational Product 
 JointStem is a 5 ml syringe including AdMSCs as 1x10
8 cells/3mL  and is stable at refrigerated 
condition up to 1 week . A positive control syringe including hyaluronic aci d will be purchased and 
packed by the aluminum foil pack  to be matched with JointStem syringe in appearance to be 
indistinguishable.   3.5.3 End of Study  
 The efficacy results will be analyzed when the last subject completes Visit 6 ( 6-month follow-up) 
and this study is finished when the last subject completes Visit 8 ( 12-month follow-up).  
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 21  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.   
Long -term follow -up visit will be conducted to collect long -term feedbacks (records of 
medications and treatments) following 2 years after injectio n for all subjects who complete  6-
month visit and accept the long- term follow -up visit. 
 3.5.4 Selection of Dose in Study  
 The dosage of JointStem was chosen through a phase 1 and 2 study conducted in South Korea.   3.5.5 Choice of Control/Comparator 
 This study uses hyaluronic aci d as a positive control 
(Synvisc- One®). The purpose of  using this 
control is to compare the efficacy of JointStem with current treatment option based on various 
endpoints.    3.5.6 Blinding  
 As this is a double -blinded study, blinding of the drug contents from the subjects, investigator s, 
and other study personnel at each clinical site is necessary. Because two syringes of JointStem and 
positive control are different, one physician must be only assigned to the role of syringe injection 
in order to maintain the double-blinding against other site physicians and staffs.  
 A subject will be assigned with one randomization code on Visit 2 (Week -5). After each subject 
completes Visit 6 (Month 6) and the data management team confirms all individual data have no 
issue, the randomization code will be open for the statistical analysis.  
 A code -break envelope for each subject including the randomization code information will be 
retained by each site and can be opened, revealing the randomization information, for emergency purposes only . Investigator should note that the occurrence of a SAE should not routinely 
precipitate immediate unblinding . An attempt to contact the sponsor must be made prior to 
unblinding. If unblinding occurs, the subject  must be early terminated; a written explanation must 
be prepared immediately.  
 3.5.7 Prior and Concomitant Treatments  
 If the use of any concomitant treatment(s) becomes necessary, the treatment(s) must be recorded in the eCRF , including the name of the drug or treatment, dose, route of administration, date and 
time of the treatment, and indication . In the event that concomitant medication is administered, the 
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 22  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  principal investigator or qualified sub- investigator must assess the subject’s eligibility of 
continuing the participation in the study.  
 
The following medications /therapies  are not allowed to be taken /used  by subjects enrolled in this 
study during the trial (by 6 -month follow-up visit) : 
• Any pain medication for osteoarthritis except rescue medication (< acetaminophen 3.25 g per 
day or narcotic pain medications per investigator discretion in the case all other pain control 
measures have failed . Any pain medication other than acetaminophen 3.25g should only be 
used as last resort and only for a very limited time until symptoms can be c ontrolled by more 
conservative methods). 
• Any other injections or invasive procedures  (including intra -articular injection s) in the affected 
joint  
• Any investigational drug (including placebo) 
• Any therapy that may affect osteoarthritis , in the judgment of the investigator  
• Lidocaine or other numbing agents while making the injection  
 After the completion of the 6- month follow -up visit, subjects may take pain medication for 
osteoarthritis and all medications will be tracked and recorded. Until the subjects c omplete the 12-
month follow -up visit, any other treatments/therapies including surgeries  (e.g. artificial joint 
replacement surgery)  that, in the judgment of the investigator, affect the assessment of 
osteoarthritis will be prohibited.  
 3.5.8 Treatment Complian ce  
 Only  subjects  who are randomized to JointStem will return on Visits 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 ( Months 1, 3, 
6, 9 and 12) or at Early Termination.  On the other hand, subjects who are randomized to the 
positive control group will only return on Visits 4, 5 and 6 (Months 1, 3 and 6) or at Early 
Termination.  
  3.6   Study Endpoints and Variables  
 3.6.1 Study Endpoints

6.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
 
6.1.1 Analytical Populations 
 
6.1.1.1 Intent- to-Treat Population 
 An intent- to-treat (ITT) population will include  subjects who received the intra- articular injection 
and have at least post -injection efficacy measurements . This cohort will be evaluated for all 
efficacy variables.  
 6.1.1.2 Per-Protocol Population 
 All subjects valid for ITT who complete d Visit 6 (Month 6) will be ‘valid per protocol’ (also called 
‘valid for efficacy’). Additional criteria may be added prior to unblinding the study database . As 
with the ITT population, this per -protocol (PP) cohort will also be evaluated for all efficacy 
variables.  
 6.1.1.3 Safety Population 
 
Any subject who was randomized  and completed Visit 2 (Week -5) will be included in the 
evaluation of safety.   This cohort will be evaluated for all safety variables.  
 6.1.2 Treatment Group Comparability 
 
Demographic variables, medical history, treatment duration, and efficacy variables at baseline will be summarized by treatment group for the subjects valid for potential safety analysis. Because, in 
theory, the goal of randomization is to ba lance out the patient characteristics, statistical tests are 
not planned for these variables.  6.1.3 Significance Level  
 
The primary efficacy hypothesis tests will be performed using a 5% significance level  (but, for the 
MRI improvement evaluation, it shall meet the validity criteria ). For the secondary efficacy 
endpoints, hypothesis tests will be performed individually at the 5% significance level. All 
hypothesis tests except for the primary efficacy hypoth esis tests will be performed with two -sided 
alternative hypotheses.

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  6.1.4 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
 
For primary efficacy endpoints , the joint functional improvement of knee joint will be evaluated 
using the following three co- primary efficacy variables  and gatekeeping procedures will be used 
for these three hypothesis tests.   Three hypothesis tests will be performed in the following order: 1) Change of WOMAC score within study group, 2) Change of VAS score within study group and 3) MRI improvement 
evaluatio n in the study group. If null hypothesis is dismissed at 5% significance level for the first 
hypothesis test, the second hypothesis will also be tested at 5% significance level. The n, for MRI 
improvement evaluation, the test will be performed to confirm if the percentage of subjects whose 
final PI evaluation is ‘improvement’ meets the validity criteria . If null hypothesis is not dismissed 
at 5% significance level  or it is lower than the validity criteria , the hypothesis test is stopped and 
it is concluded only previous item of which null hypothesis is dismissed is significant.  
 
1) Change of WOMAC score from baseline at Month 6 (JointStem group) 
 
Change of WOMAC score from baseline at Month 6 will be tested using paired t- test (one -
sided test, α=0.05)  with the null hypothesis equal to zero. If change of WOMAC score from 
baseline at Month 6 doesn’t satisfy normal distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be 
performed.  
 
If null hypothesis is dismissed, the conclusion that the function of knee joint is improved 
from at least subjects who administer IP can be drawn.    
 2) Change of VAS score from baseline at Month 6 (JointStem group)  Change of VAS score from baseline at Month 6 will be tested using paired t -test (one -sided 
test, α=0.05)  with the n ull hypothesis equal to zero . If change of VAS score from baseline 
at Month 6 doesn’t satisfy normal distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed.  
 
If null hypothesis is dismissed, the conclusion that the pain of degenerative arthritis  is 
reduced from at least subjects who administer IP can be drawn.    
 
3) MRI improvement evaluation at Month 6 (JointStem group) 
 MRI improvement evaluation will be finally analyzed through the following two steps:

report stated above.  
 
 The frequency and percentage of subjects whose final PI evaluation is ‘i mprovement’ 
will be calculated per group.  
 
If the percentage of subjects whose final PI evaluation is at least 36% , the conclusion that 
the damaged cartilage of knee joint is improved in the subjects who administer JointStem  
can be drawn.

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  7. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND RE PORTING  
 
7.1 Definitions  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event is defined in the 21 CFR 312.32(a) as “Adverse event means any untoward 
medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related .” 
 An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and  
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug)  and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. Worsening of a pre -existing medical 
condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches, and gout) after the drug administration  should be 
considered an adverse event if there is  either an increase in severity, frequency, or duration of the 
condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes.  The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from baseline values . Abnormal 
laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as adverse events; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjus tment 
in prior therapy are considered adverse events.  
 Adverse events will be reviewed continuously throughout the study.  7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that  
• is fatal  
• is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other significant medical hazard  
 
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 42  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  Life threatening:  The term life -threatening in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an AE in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event . It does not see an AE that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Hospitalization: Any adverse event leading to hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will be considered as ‘serious’, UNLESS at least one of the following exceptions is met:  
• the admission results in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours OR 
• the admission  is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start 
of the study) OR 
• a medical intervention that requires hospitalization (e.g.,  blood product transfusion or 
central line insertion ) will be not considered a serious adverse event  
 However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospitalization may fulfill the criteria of ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as a SAE dependent on clinical 
judgment.    Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  Important medical event: Any AE may be considered serious because it may jeopardize the patient 
and may require intervention to prevent another serious condition. As guidance for determination 
of importa nt medical events see the ‘WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology – Critical Terms List’ . 
These terms either see or might be indicative of a serious disease state.  
 Such reported events warrant special attention because of their possible association with a serious disease state and may lead to more decisive action than reports on other terms.  7.2 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (as defined in Section 7.1) observed by the investigator or reported by subjects after the first dose of each subject are properly 
captured in the subject’s medical records and reported on the e CRF.  
 Documentation must be supported by an entry in the subject’s file . A laboratory test abnormality 
considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator, should be reported as an adverse event . Each event should be described in detail along with start 
and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and outcome

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  7.2.1 Relationship of Adverse Event to Study Drug  
 
The following adverse event attributes must be assigned by the investigator:  adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known); event description (with detail appropriate to the event); dates of onset and resolution; severi ty; assessment of relatedness 
to study drug and action taken . The investigator may be asked to provide follow -up information, 
discharge summaries, and extracts from medical records or eCRFs.  
 If applicable, the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug will be assessed by means of 
the question: “ Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study 
drug?”  The investigator should respond to this question with either Yes or No.  7.2.2 Adverse Event Severity  
 The severity of adverse events should be graded as follows: 
• Mild – Usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• Moderate – Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• Severe – Prevents normal activities  
 Medically significant adverse events considered related to the study drug by the investigator or 
Sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable.  It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse event is related and of sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment or from the study . 
A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable adverse event . If either of these situations arises, the subject should be strongly 
encouraged to undergo an end-of- study assessment and be under medical supervision until 
symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.  7.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
 Serious adverse events will be collected and recorded from the drug administration to 3-month 
follow-ups.   Serious Adverse Event s, including laboratory test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of serious, 
after the first dose, and during follow -up period must immediately (within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness) be reported to the person/parties as detailed in the  study file . A Serious 
Adverse Event form must also be completed within 1 day of the investigator’s awareness and

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  forwarded to the  designated person/parties as detailed in the study file . Each Serious Adverse 
Event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by submission of updated reports to the 
designated person/parties.  
 Serious adverse events also will be collected an d reported within 1 working day of discovery or 
notification of the event if it occurs 7 days after the last dose of study drug or after the end of the 
study and  is thought to be possibly related to study drug. 
 For all deaths, available autopsy reports and relevant medical reports should be faxed to Sponsor 
or their designee . For this reporting process, subject assessments must be made 7 days  after 
administration of the last dose of study drug.  If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study because of a serious adverse event, this information must be included in the initial or follow -up Serious Adverse Event Report Form as 
well as the End of Study Case Report Form.  When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events mus t be reported 
to the institutional review board and Regulatory Authorities.

All data and results and all intellectual property rights in the data and results derived from the study will be the property of the sponsor, who may utilize the data in various ways, such as for submission to government regulatory authorities or disclosure to other investigators . The 
investigator, while free to utilize data derived from the study for scientific purposes, must discuss any publicatio n with the sponsor prior to release and obtain written consent of the sponsor on the 
intended publication. The sponsor recognizes the right of the investigator to publish the results 
upon completion of the study . However, the investigator must send a draft  manuscript of the 
publication or abstract to the sponsor thirty days in advance of submission in order to obtain approval prior to submission of the final version for publication. This will be reviewed promptly 
and approval will not be withheld unreasonably . In case of a difference of opinion between the 
sponsor and the investigator(s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a solution that satisfies both parties.  
 The investigator is encouraged to participate in the evaluation of the data for scientific purposes but is expected to work with the sponsor in the development of any scientific presentation or publication. Since the sponsor authors will be included, it is expected that all co- authors of the 
manuscripts will have an opportunity for feedback in the content and conclusions . The technical 
and editorial resources of the sponsor will be available to assist in the development of abstracts, presentations, and publications regarding this study and it is expected that drafts will be sent to the 
sponsor with adequate time for input and revisions prior to submission.

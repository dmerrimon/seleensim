Parallel Design Study to Evaluate the Effects of BPN14770 in 
Patients with Early Stage Alzheimer’s Disease   
Study Number:  BPN14770 -CNS -201 
Study Phase:  Phase 2  
Study Objectives:  
 
In subject s with a clini cal diagnosis of early  stage Alzheimer’s disease  (AD)  receiving cholinesterase inhibitor 
therapy:  
• To evaluate the efficacy  of two dose levels (10 mg bid and 25 mg bid) of BPN14770  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BPN14770 10 and 25 mg bid 
• To obt ain pharmacokinetic data on BPN14770 in this subject population  
 
Overview of Endpoints   
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:   
• Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status - Delayed Memory Index (RBANS DMI) – 
change from baseline assessed at Week 1 3 
 
Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints  
• RBANS total score  
• Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study  Activ ities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS -ADL  ) total score  
• Mini -Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) score  
• Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes score (CDR -SB) 
• Clinical Global I mpression – Improvement (CGI- I) 
• Composite endpoint based on  AD Composite Score (ADCOMS)  
 
Safety and Tolerability:  The safety variables to be assessed include adverse events; clinical laboratory parameters 
(chemistry, hematology,  lipids, urinalysis ); 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs); physical examinations; and vital 
signs (including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate).  
 
Pharmacokinetics:  Plasma BPN14770 concentrations will be obtained during the Weeks 1, 4, 8 and 13 clinic 
visits.  Samples will be drawn according to the time of the clinic visit, with documentation of time of day testing 
was performed, and time of day of most recent dose of study medication.  Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  samples will be 
retained and may also be utilized subsequently for  biomarker assessment.  
 
Biomarkers:  Blood samples will also be obtained for biomarker testing, at Baseline (Day 1) and at Weeks 1, 4, 8 
and 13.  Samples will be frozen and retained with the PK plasma samples and may be utilized subsequently for biomarker assessment.    
 
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2 , randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, 3 -arm, parallel -design study to evaluate the effects 
of BPN14770 in subject s with  a clinical diagnosis of e arly stage AD. The study will consist of a Screening p eriod 
of up to 28 days prior to initial study drug administration, a 13 -week double -blind treatment, and a final follow -up 
visit for safety one week after treatment is concluded.    
Randomization will be stratified based on presence or absence of an ApoE4 allele in the patient’s genetic profile. Within each stratum, subject s will be randomized in a blinded, balanced fashion to receive either BPN14770 10mg 
bid, BPN14770 25 mg bid, or matching placebo.

Parallel Design Study to Evaluate the Effects of BPN14770 in 
Patients with Early Stage Alzheimer’s Disease   
Study Number:  BPN14770 -CNS -201 
Study Phase:  Phase 2  
 
Subjects will have a total of eight clinic visits: Scre ening; Baseline (Day 1); Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, and the final 
Follow -up Visit. Cognitive testing will be performed during each clinic visit except the final Follow -up Visit. 
Safety and tolerability assessments throughout the study will include adverse event  monitoring , ECGs, vital signs,  
blood chemistry, hematology ; urinalysis  will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 1, 4, and 13 , and 
lipid evaluations at Baseline and Week 13 .  Should gastrointestinal (GI) side effects occur, n ausea may be treated  
with 5 -HT3 antagonists, and diarrhea may be treated with loperamide.  Anticholinergic drugs may not be used to 
treat GI side effects.  
 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected during the treatment period to confirm that study drug is present, and to 
estimate plasma exposure at Weeks 1, 4 , 8 and 13.   
 
An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will provide safety oversight for this study.  The DSMB will consist of two qualified MDs and one statistician.  The DSMB  will review standard safety da ta approximately 
every four (4) months, based on enrollment rate.  A DSMB charter will be developed to further outline the DSMB 
responsibilities and the desired listings, summaries and analyses.     
Planned Numbers of Subject s: 
A target  of 80 evaluable subjects per group (240 total)  is planned.  Approximately 85 subject s per group will be 
enrolled (255 total) in order to account for potential dropouts.

Study Phase:  Phase 2  
 
Study Procedures : 
The Screening Visit will occur up to 28 days  prior to the first study drug administration  on Day 1.  During 
screening, subject s will sign the informed consent form prior to any study procedures being performed.  Following 
a positive clinical diagnosis for e arly stage AD , subject s will have information collected regarding their 
neurologic al and medical/surgical history, race/ethnicity, social history (tobacco, alcohol, and/or drug use), and use 
of prescription and over -the-counter medications.  Either a b lood sample or buccal swab will be obtained for 
genetic testing for the ApoE4 allele i f testing was not previously performed and documented for the subject .  [Note: 
previous ApoE4 genetic testing results must be reviewed by study personnel ].  Subject s will undergo a full physical 
exam and have vital signs and 12 -lead ECG measured .  Height, weight, and BMI will also be collected  (or 
calculated in the case of BMI) .  Blood samples will be obtained  for chemistry and hematology. Urine will be 
collected for urinalysis.  Other eligibility criteria assessed during the screening perio d include serolo gy (HbsAg, 
HCV); Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS ) assessment; screening, diagnostic assessment of early 
stage AD, and MMSE for eligibility.  
 
At the Baseline visit (Day 1), prior to drug administration, subjects will receive an abbreviated p hysical 
examination and ECG.  Fasting b lood samples for blood chemistry , hematology , lipid testing and biomarkers will 
be obtained. A serum pregnancy test will be conducted for females of childbearing potential.  Randomization will be stratified based on presence or absence of an ApoE4 allele following the baseline assessments.   
 
During the Double -Blind period, subject s will receive twice -daily treatment with blinded study medication.  Doses 
of study medication should be taken in the morning and at night, a pproximately 12 hours apart, and at least 30 
minutes prior to or 1 hour after meals .  
 
Subject s will return to the clinic at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 13, and for a follow -up safety visit 
approximately one week after completing the Double- Blind peri od. Fasting blood samples will be collected at the 
Week 13 visit.   During clinic visits, adverse effects will be assessed, and laboratory measures, vital signs, and ECG 
will be repeated according to the Schedule of Assessments.  Efficacy measures will be obtained to measure the 
effects of BPN14770 on cognition as well as functional status at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 13.  E very effort will be 
made to retain each subject  throughout the entire study period ; however, i f a subject  must be withdrawn prior to 
Week 13 , all Week 13 safety assessments should be completed, if possible.

Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:   
In this r andomized double -blind, placebo- controlled 3-arm parallel  study, 255 subject s will be randomized (1:1:1) 
to receive one of  the followin g three  treatment s (85 per group), in addition to receiving their ongoing treatment 
with a cholinesterase inhibitor : 
 
• BPN14770 10 mg bid 
• BPN14770 25 mg bid 
• Matching Placebo  
 
All study medications  will be provided as identical- appearing HPMC capsules in HPE  bottles.  Study drug will be 
taken by mouth (PO) with water  (at least 120 mL = 4 ounces)  in the morning and at night, approximately 12 hours 
apart, and at least 30 minutes prior to or 1 hour after meals.   
Statistical Analyses:  
Efficacy Analyses  
The prim ary efficacy population will be the intent to treat (ITT) efficacy population, which will include all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at least one follow -up visit. The 
per protocol (PP) population (randomize d subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at 
least one follow -up visit with no significant protocol violations) and the completers (CP) population (randomized 
subject s who completed all 13 weeks of treatment with no significant protocol violations ) will be used to evaluate 
the robustness of the ITT results.  
 
Change from baseline will be calculated for the primary and secondary efficacy parameters at each time point and descriptive statistics provided for each time point. Summar y plots of these data will also be provided. For RBANS 
DMI and total score, MMSE score, and ADCS -ADL total score, pairwise differences in change from baseline 
between the treatment groups (10 mg vs 25 mg BPN14770, 10 mg BPN14770 vs Placebo, 25 mg BPN14770 vs Placebo) will be assessed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that includes baseline as a covariate and factors for week, site and treatment and the interaction term for week and treatment; the pairwise differences will be assessed at each ti me point.  CDR sum of boxes will be analyzed in the same manner .  
 Change from baseline in the other RBANS index scores (immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, attention, language) will be summarized by time  point, with descriptive statistics provided.  
 The composite endpoint will be based on the AD Composite Score (ADCOMS), a composite clinical outcome for prodromal Alzheimer's disease trial s.
20 The composite endpoint and analysis model will be fully specified in the 
statistical analysis plan.  
 
The efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT, PP and CP analysis populations.

Study Number:  BPN14770 -CNS -201 
Study Phase:  Phase 2  
Supplemental analyses assessing treatment effect relative to severity of disease based on baseline MMSE score may 
also be performed.  
 
Safety Analyses  
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment.  
Adverse Events (AEs), including clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities  as assessed by the Investigator , 
will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and AE  severity and 
relatedness  to treatment will be assessed. AEs will be tabulated for each of the treatment groups separately, as well 
as for all BPN14770 recipients combined. Summaries will also be provided by severity and relationship to 
treatment.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be summarized separately, in a manner similar to that used for 
Adverse Events.  
 
For each AE , the difference in incidence rates between  the each BPN14770 dos e group will be compared to the 
placebo group using a Fisher’s exact test.   
Sample Size Determination:  
This study will enroll 255 subject s (85 per treatment arm), in anticipation of evaluating at least 240  subject s (80 per 
treatment). Based on 80 subjects  per group completing the study, the probability is 80 percent that the study will 
detect a treatment difference at a two -sided 0.05 significance level, if the true difference between BPN14770 25 mg 
and pla cebo is 7.15 units. Using the standardized mean difference (SMD) to estimate effect size, a change of 7.15 
units on the DMI score is an effect size of 0.45.

Page 18 of 61 4 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background 
Tetra Discovery Partners , Inc.  is a central nervous system (CNS) biotechnology company that 
uses structure -based drug design to discover negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of 
phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) subtypes for neurological and psychiatric diseases.   
Since the introduction of cholinesterase inhibitors to address the depletion of acetylcholine in the 
Alzheimer’s brain (1995) and memantine to improve glutamatergic signaling (2003), there have been no new drugs to treat the condition.  Attempts to develop disease -modifying therapies have 
focused mainly on the amyloid pathway .
3,4 This pathway has medical and genetic support but so 
far has proved challenging for therapeutic devel opment .  Also of concern is that successful 
disease modifying therapeutics, if they slow Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression, are unlikely 
to reverse the cognitive impairment caused by the disease.  Thus there is a need for new drugs to 
address cognitive impairment in AD and other dementias, as well as a need to find drugs that 
may help restore cognitive function and improve brain resilience to the damage caused by AD. 
Tetra has developed a mechanistically novel class of drugs to address cognitive impairment 
across multiple psychiatric and neurological indications .  These new drugs selectively target 
subtypes of phosphodiesterase type -4D ( PDE4 D).5,6 The PDE4 D enzyme  subtype is a highly 
validated CNS target for improving cognition.7 
BPN14770 is a novel, selective small molecule inhibitor of the PDE4D enzyme, which is 
considered to play a role in modulating the  3’- 5’- cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway 
(cAMP ) in the brain important for learning and memory.  BPN14770 is in clinical development 
for treating alzheimer’s disease.  This is the fourth  clinical study evaluating its effects in humans; 
the first study was the single  dose escalation study  (BPN14770- CNS -101; clinicaltrials.gov 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), the second was a multiple dose escalation study in healthy volunteers 
(BPN14770- CNS -102; clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , and the third study was single -dose, 6-
period crossover study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of BPN14770 on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment (BPN14770- CNS -103; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
4.2 Rationale 
As of February 27, 2017, a total of 136 subjects have received BPN14770 either as a single dose 
or as a mult iple dose regimen.  Of these subjects, 106 (78%) were ≤  55 years of age and 30 
(22%) were ≥60 years of age.  
The single dose escalation study ( -101) in 24 subjects ≤  55years of age determined that  a single  
100mg dose was the maximum tolerated dose of BPN14770, based on the occurrence of nausea 
and vomiting in the majority of subjects at this dose.  There were no notable adverse events in other body systems, no observed changes in vital signs  or electrocardiogram, no adverse 
laboratory findings, and no serious adverse events  were recorded .  The multiple dose escalation 
study assesse d 15 mg, 30 mg, and 50 mg doses given BID to 18 subjects ≤45 years of age and 
doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg given BID to  30 subjects  ≥ 60 years of age.  All of these 
doses were well tolerated.  An additional cohort of  6 subjects ≤45 years of age received 75mg 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 19 of 61 once daily in order to compare the safety and PK profile s to the 100mg MTD  determined in the 
single dose study.  The 75 mg dose w as associated with GI adverse experiences, confirming the 
findings at 100 mg in the single ascending dose study.  The BPN14770 doses assessed in the 
scopolamine challenge study were 10 mg and 50 mg QD. Of the 38 subjects enrolled, 37 
received at least one of the two doses of BPN14770; one subject withdrew from the crossover study prior to a dosing cohort containing BPN14770.   
In the dose escalation study ( -102), t here was evidence of greater than proportional increases in 
BPN14770 exposure after a single dose or repeated dosing. Drug accumulation was 
approximately 2 -fold after QD dosing. After  BID dosing, moderate drug accumulation of 
approximately 3 - to 5- fold was observed. Steady state appeared to be reached within 2 to 4 days 
of BID or QD dosing. When adjusted for differences in dose, mean BPN14770 exposure appeared to be similar between healthy young and healthy elderly subjects.  
In the multiple ascending dose study ( -102), BPN14770 administered twice daily to healthy 
elderly subjects was  associated with  improvement in complex attention/working memory, 
delayed recall of verbal information, and delayed recall of visual information (10 and 20 mg doses). No beneficial or detrimental effects were observed on other cognitive tasks  studied. The 
40-mg BID dose was not associated with improvement in any cognitive domain, possibly  
because of a higher frequency of adverse events, primarily headaches,  at this dose level.  
In this initial Phase 2, randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled 3 -arm parallel study, 255 
subject s will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of the following three treatments (85 per 
group): BPN14770 10 mg bid, BPN14770 25 mg bid, matching placebo bid. Steady state exposure at the 25 mg dose is estimated to be at least 3 -fold higher than at the 10 mg dose. The 
objective s of the study are  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two doses of BPN 14770, as 
well as to obtain PK data to correlate with cognitive and safety outcomes.  This study will assess 
two doses of BPN14770, 10 mg and 25 mg, both administered twice daily. These doses are well below the maximum tolerated single dose of 100 mg determined in the initial single dose study ( -
101), and also are below the maximum twice daily dose of 50 mg that was well tolerated in the multiple dose study  (-102),  and are therefore expected to be safe and well -tolerated in this trial 
in subject s with AD.  Based on accumulation data from the multiple -dose study, the exposure 
difference between the 10 and 25 mg doses should be 4-fold.   
4.3 Risk/Benefit 
4.3.1 Preclini cal Pharmacology 
BPN14770 is a first -in-class, subtype selective, phosphodiesterase type -4D (PDE4D) -allosteric 
inhibitor . The unique mechanism of action and subtype selectivity distinguishes BPN14770 from 
the two approved PDE4 inhibitors, roflumilast (Daliresp™) and apremilast (Otezla™).  Roflumilast and apremilast are competitive inhibitors that inhibit the PDE4 enzymes by binding in the active site competitively with 3’ - 5’- cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  As the 
amino acid sequence of the PDE4 active site is conserved between the four subtypes, roflumilast and apremilast inhibit all subtypes of PDE4 equally strongly.  Both compounds cause emesis in humans and other species, and as a class, PDE4 competitive inhibitors have been found to cause mesen teric vasculopathy in rats, dogs and primates, although this toxicity has not been observed 
in humans.  In contrast, BPN14770 does not bind to the active site of the PDE4 enzyme and does

Page 20 of 61 not cause emesis in ferrets, cynomolgous monkeys or marmosets ; furthe rmore, it has not been 
found to cause mesenteric vasculopathy in rats or dogs in toxicological studies of 3 months  
duration.  Thus, BPN14770 presents a unique procognitive and preclinical safety profile.   
Clearance of BPN14770 by hepatocytes from human, rat, dog and monkey, expressed as hepatic 
extraction ratio (EH), was 16%, 8.2%, 17%, and 12%, respectively.  Qualitative metabolite profiling in human, rat, dog, and monkey hepatocytes showed a single metabolite in human (<1% parent).  BPN14770 was highly bound to plasma proteins in all species tested.  The fraction unbound (free) was 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.5%, for mouse, rat, dog, and human, respectively.   
BPN14770 is highly bioavailable in rats, mice and dogs (F% = 100), distributes to brain (B/P = 
0.32-0.48), and has a plasma t
½ of 4.8 hours in rats, 10.9 hours in mice, and 11 hours in dogs.  
The multi- species pharmacokinetic data suggest that BPN14770 will have adequate half -life for 
once daily oral administration in humans.  In bile duct cannulated rats, BPN14770 was eliminated as a conjugate through the bile.  Only the unchanged drug was detected in plasma, and no BPN14770 was detected in urine.   
BPN14770 has cognitive benefit in the mouse Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test at >0.3 
mg/kg by PO , as shown by an increase in the Discrimination Index.  BPN14770 maximum 
plasma concentration (C max) at the minimum effective dose (MED) was 160 ng/mL (in plasma) 
and 40 ng/gm (in brain).  Cognitive benefit is maintained after chronic dosing for 7 days.  BPN14770 also has benefit in a mouse model of cholinergic impairment, the scopolamine -
impaired Y -maze (male C57Bl6 mice MED = 1 mg/kg).   
BPN14770 did not affect cardiovascular function in beagle dogs at doses up to 100 mg/kg, nor did the compound affect respiratory function or exert neuropharmacologic effects in rats at doses up to 60 mg/kg.  In the in vitro human Ether -à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) assay, an increase in 
current of 12% and 33% was seen at concentrations of 10 and 30 µM, respectively.  No IC
50 
could be calculated due to this minor increase in current.  
In rat toxicology studies of 28-days and 13-weeks, BPN14770 was well tolerated up to 60 mg/kg with no deaths on study, and no adverse hematology, clinical chemistry, liver weight or gross necropsy findings. There were no microscopic findings. Unlike the PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast and apremilast, BPN14770 did not cause mesenteric vasculopathy at the doses studied.   
In dog toxicology studies of 28-days and 13- weeks, the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAE L) for BPN14770 was 30 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg in the 28-day study, BPN14770 caused 
inappetance and weight loss and in female dogs an approximately 30 msec increase in QTc with 
a concomitant increase in heart rate of 10 bpm. There were no changes in hematology  or 
ophthalmology. Macroscopic observations included pale livers in two of eight animals at 100 mg/kg which correlated with mild alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation only in those two animals. Microscopic changes of periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation were observed in the livers of one male and two female dogs at 100 mg/kg. No liver changes were observed in recovery dogs suggesting that these changes, if present, were reversible.

Page 21 of 61 4.3.2 Clinical Experience 
4.3.2.1 BPN14770- CNS -101 
A first-in-human (FIH), single ascending dose (SAD) trial (BPN14770- CNS -101) in 24 healthy 
subjects  at doses ranging from 5 mg to 100 mg has been completed. The results from this study 
indicate single doses of BPN14770, in the range of 5 mg to 100 mg, were safe and generally well 
tolerated.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 100 mg, after 4 of 6 
subjects in this dose group experienced nausea and , of those, two experienced vomiting.   
The most commonly reported treatment -emergent, drug- related adverse events were nausea and 
vomiting.  No safety signals were noted in the results of the other safety analyses.  No deaths or other serious adverse events were reported.  No subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse events.  
In the  SAD trial, detectable plasma BPN147 70 concentrations were measured after dosing ( at all 
4 dose levels) starting between 0.5 hour and 1 hour after dosing, continuing through at least 48 
hours after dosing.  Drug absorption was variable but moderately rapid with median t ime to 
maximum concent ration  (T
max) values ranging from 1.5 to 3 hours.  The plasma 
pharmacokinetics of BPN14770 after oral administration appeared to be linear for single doses ranging from 5 to 100 mg; although a slight trend for a greater than proportional increase in exposure was observed in the 100- mg group as compared to the lower dose groups.  The 
apparent terminal elimination half -life of BPN14770 was consistent among dose groups and 
averaged between 11 and 13 hours.  Based on the preclinical models, the concentrations 
associated with doses as low as 15 mg were potentially adequate to produce cognitive 
improvement after once - or twice - per day dosing. 
4.3.2.2 BPN14770- CNS -102 
In the multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial  (BPN14770- CNS -102), 76 healthy  young and elderly 
subjects were administered multiple doses of BPN14770 twice daily (every 12 hours) for 8 days.  
Young subjects ( ≤45 years; n=18 treated, 7 placebo)  received twice -daily doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, 
50 mg or placebo for 8 days.  Elderly subjects  (≥60 years; n=30 treated, 15 placebo)  received 
twice -daily doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg for 8 days. Twice -daily dosing was selected to 
ensure adequate BPN14770 levels in the brain and plasma throughout the day and night.  An additional cohort of 6 young subjects received a once -daily dose of 75 mg for 8 days  to obtain 
additional safety and  pharmacokinetic ( PK) data at a dose level close to the  MTD  determined in 
the SAD study .   
No deaths or serious adverse events were reported , and no subjects in either the young or elderly 
cohorts withdrew from the study due to adverse events.  A ll treatment- emergent adverse events 
resolved without sequelae by the follow-up visit.  
All study -drug related adverse events that occurred in more than 1 young subject were in the 75-
mg QD dose group and consisted of nausea (reported by 4 of 6 subjects, vomiting (reported by 2 of 6 subjects who also experienced nausea), and decreased appetite (reported by 3 of 6 subjects). Across the young subject cohorts, all but 2 of the reported adverse events were mild i n severity; 
moderate nausea and vomiting were reported in 1 of 6 subjects (16.7%) in the 75- mg QD dose 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 22 of 61 group on Day 2 of multiple dosing. The se events were considered by the Investigator as probably 
related to study treatment, resolved without sequelae within 13 hours of onset, and did not recur 
upon subsequent dosing. Among the young subject dose groups, no clinically significant effects of 
multiple oral doses of BPN14770 (15 mg, 30 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg) were observed on biochemistry, 
hematology, or urinaly sis; vital signs; or ECGs.  
 
Among the elderly subject cohorts, the percentage of subjects who experienced at least one 
treatment- emergent adverse event was similar between the 10 -mg BID, 20-mg BID, and placebo 
groups (ranging from 30% to 50%) and was higher for the 40-mg BID dose group (90%). Likewise, 
the percentage of subjects with at least one drug-related adverse event was also higher for the 40-mg BID dose group (70%) compared with the 10-mg BID dose group (40%), the 20-mg BID dose group (20%), and the placebo group (26.7%).  Adverse events reported in 2 or more elderly subjects within 
a dose group were all reported by subjects in the 40-mg dose group and consisted of diarrhea, 
increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, hot flush (each reported at a frequency rate of 20%) and headache (reported at a frequency rate of 40%).  Across the elderly subject cohorts, 2 adverse events (dizziness and hypotension) of moderate severity were reported in 1 of the 10 subjects (10.0%) in the 10 mg BID dose group, and 1 headache of moderate severity was reported in 1 of 10 
subjects (10.0%) in the 40-mg BID dose group.  Among the elderly subject dose groups, no clinically 
significant effects of multiple oral doses of BPN14770 (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) were observed on biochemistry, hematology, or urinalysis; vital signs; or ECGs.   
With respect to cognitive testing,  BPN14770 10 mg given twice daily was associated with 
improvement in complex attention/working memory and delayed recall of both visual and verbal 
information. Treatment with BPN14770 20 mg twice daily was associated with similar benefits as the 10 mg twic e daily regimen, excluding improvement in delayed recall of visual information. Neither 
the 10- or 20-mg BID regimens was  associated with improvement in psychomotor function, visual, 
or verbal learning, or executive function. The 40-mg BID regimen was not associated with improvement in any cognitive domain.   Pharmacokinetic analyses found that steady-state appeared to be reached after 3 to 4 days of BID or QD dosing in both young and elderly subjects. After a single oral dose of BPN14770 in healthy 
young s ubjects, C
max and AUC 12 appeared to increase in a dose-proportional fashion over the dose 
range of 15 to 50 mg, with a greater than proportional increase in exposure observed after a 75- mg 
dose. Following BID dosing of BPN14770 in healthy young subjects, C max and AUC 12 appeared to 
increase in a greater than dose-proportional fashion from 15 mg to either 30 mg or 50 mg. A 
moderate degree of accumulation (up to approximately 5-fold) was observed after BID dosing in 
healthy young subjects, with less accumulation (approximately 2-fold) after QD dosing.  
 
After a single oral dose of BPN14770 in healthy elderly subjects, C max appeared to increase in a 
greater than dose-proportional fashion over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg, whereas AUC 12 appeared 
to increase in a greater than dose-proportional fashion from 10 mg or 20 mg to 40 mg. Following 
BID dosing of BPN14770 in healthy elderly subjects, C max and AUC 12 appeared to increase in a 
greater than dose-proportional fashion over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. A modera te degree of 
accumulation (up to approximately 4-fold) was observed after BID dosing in healthy elderly subjects.  
 
In healthy young subjects, mean peak to trough fluctuation was similar among BID regimens, 
ranging from 171% to 179%, and was 337% for the QD regimen.  In healthy elderly subjects, mean 
peak to trough fluctuation was similar among BID regimens, ranging from 156% to 249%.

4.3.2.3 BPN14770- CNS -103 
The third Phase 1 trial of BPN14770 (BPN14770- CNS -103) was a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled, 6-period crossover study to evaluate the effects of BPN14770 10 and 50 mg 
in reversing scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in healthy volunteers. A positive control, 
donepezil 10 mg, was included, and additivity of BPN14770 50 mg to donepezil 10 mg in reversing scopolamine effects was also evaluated. A total of 38 subjects were enrolled into the study. The study duration was up to 12 weeks with 6 weeks of single-dose treatment visits. The study consisted of a screening visit (up to 28 days prior to f irst study drug administration), 6 
inpatient treatment visits (Periods 1 through 6), and a follow-up/early termination visit (7 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug). An additional study visit may have been necessary to complete the required cognit ive test familiarization if not completed during the screening visit. 
Each treatment visit occurred approximately 1 week apart, allowing a 6 to 8 day washout period. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences, each containing the 6 following treatments:  
A. Scopolamine placebo + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil placebo B. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil placebo C. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 10 mg + donepezil placebo D. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 50 mg + donepezil placebo E. Sc opolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil 10 mg 
F. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 50 mg + donepezil 10 mg  
The Cogstate Computerized Battery Test results suggest that, as expected, a 0.5 mg dose of scopolamine induced a decline in cognitive function, while a 10 -mg dose of donepezil 
ameliorated this decline. Doses of 10 or 50 mg of BPN14770 did not produce a systematic reversal of the scopolamine-induced cognitive decline, administered alone or with a 10-mg dose of donepezil.  BPN14770 10 mg was safe and generally well tolerated when administered with scopolamine  
in healthy subjects. BPN14770 50 mg was generally safe when administered with scopolamine, or with scopolamine and donepezil in healthy subjects. The incidence of nausea and vomiting increased s everal fold when either BPN14770 50 mg or donepezil was administered with 
scopolamine, or when both BPN14770 and donepezil were administered with scopolamine, compared to BPN14770 10 mg, placebo, or scopolamine alone. None of the TEAEs that were reported in this study were out of the ordinary or unexpected in clinical nature or character for this population of healthy subjects.  The administration of BPN14770 with donepezil did not appreciably increase the incidence of adverse GI side effects associated wit h donepezil alone.

5 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, 3-a rm, parallel -design study to 
evaluate the effects of BPN14770 in 255 subject s with a clinical diagnosis of e arly stage AD. 
The study will consist of a Screening period  of 28 days or less, unless additional time is required 
for washout of concomitant medications. The Screening period will be followed by a 13- week 
double-blind treatment  period , and a final follow -up visit for safety one week after treatment is 
concluded. 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 25 of 61 Randomization will be stratified based on presence or absence of an ApoE4 allele in the 
subject ’s geneti c profile. Within each stratum, subject s will be ra ndomized in a blinded, balanced 
fashion to receive either BPN14770 10mg bid, BPN14770 25 mg bid, or matching placebo. In 
total 2 55 subjects will be randomized (i.e., 85 subjects per treatment arm).  
Subject s will have a total of eight clinic visits: Screen ing; Baseline (Day 1); Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 
and the final Follow- up Visit. The screening visit will consist of consenting the subject , 
obtaining a medical history, full physical exam, height, weight, BMI , ECG, serology testing, 
chemistry, hemat ology , urinalysis, ApoE4 testing,  pregnancy testing, and cognitive assessments. 
If the subject  fully qualifies for the study, randomization will occur at the Baseline visit when the 
subject  will receive study medication.  
Cognitive testing will occur at each visit except the final Follow -up Visit.  Safety assessments 
will also be performed at each visit, to include adverse event monitoring, vital signs, ECG, and 
chemistry and hematology . Urinalysis will also be performed at Screening and Baseline and 
Weeks 1, 4 and 13. Lipid testing will be performed at Baseline and Week 13. Risk of suicidal ity 
will be assessed at Screening, Baseline and Week s 1, 4, and 13. 
Pharmacokinetic testing will occur at the clinic visits at Weeks 1, 4 , 8 and 13.   
5.2 Dose Selection 
Doses of 10 and 25 mg BPN14770 to be taken twice daily were chosen for testing in this study.   
Based on pharmacokinetic data from study BPN14770- CNS -102 (MAD), steady state average 
plasma concentrations of BPN 14770 10 mg are projected to be approximately 60 n g/ml. 
Therefore, the lower dose of 10 mg has the potential to demonstrate efficacy in this study, although given the uncertainties of translation from preclinical models, it may be below the effective range.   On the other hand, the 25 mg dose should be above that needed for efficacy, and 
is estimated to produce steady state  with projected average plasma levels of  concentrations over 
200 ng/ml .  The twice -daily doses of 10 mg and 25mg selected for this study both fall well 
within the tolerance limits  defined  by the SAD and MAD studies.   
5.3 Study Duration 
The total duration of the study for each subject will be up to 127 days (18 weeks), including a maximum of a 28- day screening  period, 13 weeks of dosing, and a follow-up period (7 days  after 
last dose ).

Page 29 of 61 6.4 Subject Withdrawal  
All subjects have the right to withdraw from this study at any time .  In addition, it is the right of 
the Investigator to remove subjects from the study as a result of adverse reactions, a protocol 
violation, or non- compliance, or any other reason.   Subjects must be discontinued for the 
following reasons: 
• Subject withdraws consent or requests discontinuation from the study for any reason; 
• Occurrence of a medical condition or cir cumstance that exposes the subject to substantial risk 
and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to the requirements of the protocol  as determined 
by the Investigator; 
• Any serious adverse event (SAE) , clinical significant adverse event, severe laboratory  
abnormality, concomitant illness, or other medical condition which indicates to the 
Investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the subject; 
• Pregnancy;  
• Requirement for prohibited concomitant medication; 
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor or the regulatory authority. 
Should a subject withdraw after administration of BPN14770 (or placebo ), or should the 
Investigator decide to withdraw the subject, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol- stipulated observations up to the time of withdrawal.  Week 13  procedures ( see Section 
10.3 Week 13 ) and Section 16.1 Schedule of Study Assessments) will be completed at the time 
of the subject’s withdrawal and an explanation provided as to why the subject is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study. 
In a case of subjects lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the subject must be made and 
documented in the subject’s medical records. The Investigator must document the primary reason for discontinuation of a study subject on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF ).  If the reason for withdrawal is a clinical AE, monitoring 
will continue until the AE resolves or the Investigator assesses the AE as chronic and  stabilized . 
6.5 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who do not meet eligibility criteria at Baseline will not be randomized and will be considered a screen failure.   Subjects who withdraw from the study for any reason will not be 
replaced.   
7 TREATMENT OF SUBJ ECTS 
7.1 Treatment Arms 
In this randomized, double- blind, placebo controlled, 3- arm, parallel group stu dy, 255 subjects 
will be assigned to receive one of three treatments via balanced randomization (1:1:1). 
Randomization will occur separately within each ApoE 4 stratum (presence/absence of ApoE4 
isoform) to ensure similar numbers of ApoE4 positive subjects are present in each treatment group. The three treatments are: 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 30 of 61 A. BPN14770 10mg,  twice- daily   
B. BPN14770 25mg, twice- daily  
C. Matched placebo, twice daily  
7.2 Study Medications 
The 10 mg and 25 mg BPN14770 capsules and placebo capsules intended for use in this Phase 2 
clinical trial are manufactured  by Catalent, Inc. and will be packaged, labeled, and shipped for 
clinical use to sites by Sherpa Clinical Packaging  (San D iego, CA).   
 The 10 mg and 25 mg BPN14770 capsules are manufactured using a wet granulation process.  The same granulation is used to manufacture both strengths of capsules by adjusting the amount of granulation. The appropriate amount of granulation is blended wi th additional excipients to 
provide a homogeneous blend.  The blend is then filled into hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), size 1, opaque white/opaque white capsules.  The capsules are packaged as  34-count in 
60 cc, white, high- density polyethy lene (HDPE), round bottles with 33 mm, with white 
polypropylene ribbed caps; 12- count bottles are similarly packaged .  Over the course of the 
study, each subject will receive six 34 -count bottles and one 12-count bottle.  The container -
closure system is la beled with a study- specific label and stored at controlled room temperature 
(20ºC – 25ºC) in a secured location (locked) with access restricted to authorized personnel only.  Storage temperature will be monitored and recorded.     BPN14770 placebo capsules are manufactured, packaged, labeled and stored similarly to the active capsules.  
7.3 Drug  Accountability 
The Investigator or designated study personnel is responsible for keeping accurate records of the study drugs  (and other components) used in this study .  These records should include 
documentation of receipt, inventory, and disposition to subject.  The records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates (if applicable), and any unique code numbers assigned (if applicable).  
The s tudy monitor will review study drug records periodically during the conduct of the study.   
At the end of the study, all partial and empty containers must be returned to the Sponsor or , if 
requested by the Sponsor, destroyed at the site according to standa rd operating procedure ( SOP).  
Records of destruction of study drug at the site  must include bottle identifying information and 
number of capsules in each bottle.  All documentation is to be filed in the Pharmacy Manual.   
In accordance with Good Pharmacy Practices, gloves should always be worn by study personnel 
when handling study drug . 
7.4 Blinding 
This is a randomized, double-blind study , meaning that neither site staff nor  subject will know 
what the subject is receiving.  
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 31 of 61 Randomization codes for a specific subject will be available to the Investigator or designee for 
use in case of an emergency code break requirement .  Confirmation of release of the unblinded 
treatment designation  will be required by the Sponsor.  The PI  or designee will be responsible for 
maintaining the blind, consistent with protocol design, throughout the study , except in the case of 
an emergency code break.  
The Investigator will be required to notify the Sponsor in the event of any breaking of the blind 
for any reason.  Blinding is not to be broken during the study unless considered necessary by the 
Investigator for emergency situations for reasons of subject  safety. The Investigator should 
contact the Medical Monitor before breaking the blind. When the blind is broken, the reason must be fully documented. 
The subjects, Investigator , and all other study personnel involved with subject assessments will 
remain blinded to the actual treatme nt assignments of the subjects.  The Investigator will be 
ultimately r esponsible for ensuring that the integrity of the blind is maintained throughout the 
study.   
7.5 Assignment of Subjects to Treatment Arms 
A randomization schedule will be generated by a statistician unassociated with the study 
execution prior to the start of the study.  Subjects will be randomized on Day  1and receive their 
bottle of medication that same day.  
7.6 Study Drug Administration 
Study drug will be taken by mouth (PO) with water (at least 120 mL = 4 ounces) in the morning 
and before bed , approximately 12 hours apart, and at least 30 minutes prior to or 1 hour after 
meals. The first dose should be taken one hour after dinner on Day 1.  
7.7 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medication taken 14- days prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 1) an d 
during the study through the Week 14 Follow -up Visit  should be recorded with indication, daily 
dose, and start and stop dates of administration. 
Subjects are required to be on a stable dosing regimen of donepezil or another cholinesterase 
inhibitor for at least 2 months, i.e., 56 days prior, to their Baseline visit. Doses of these 
medications may not change during the study. 
Memantine is not permitted during the trial and must be discontinued at least 3 weeks (21 days) 
prior to Bas eline.  Subjects are required to discontinue all other centrally active medication , other 
than cholinesterase inhibitors, including psychotropic drugs, or other centrally active medications [e.g., CNS - penetrant beta blockers], and moderate to strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, 
CYP2D6, or other cytochromes) at least 14 days  prior to the first dose of study drug (Treatment 
Period 1, Day 1) and during the study (Follow -Up Visit ). For specific medications , refer  to

• General appearance  
• Skin 
• Extremities  
• Respiratory examination  
• Cardiovascular assessment including rhythm and presence of cardiac abnormalities 
• Abdominal examination  
Significant findings prior to the start of dosing will be recorded on the Medical History page of 
the eCRF .  Only changes from baseline physical examination findings that meet the definition of 
a treatment -emergent AE will be recorded as  an AE; any changes occurring between Screening 
and Baseline require an update to medical history . 
8.5 Height, Weight, Body Mass Index   
Body weight and height are to be measured at Screening , and body weight will be repeated at 
Baseline and the Week 13  visit a s specified in  the Schedule of Assessments .  Subjects will wear 
indoor clothing and remove their shoes prior to  the measurements .  Body Mass I ndex (BMI) will 
be calculated and recorded .   
8.6 Vital Signs 
Vital signs ( pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature ) will be measured at 
Screening, during the Treatment Visits, and Follow -Up as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments. 
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured using a calibrated, fully automated machine with 
a cuff that is appropriate to the size of the upper arm.  If a fully automated machine is not available, blood pressure may be measured manually.  Blood pressure at the Screening Visit should be obtained in both arms and the arm with the highe r value should be used for ongoing 
monitoring throughout the rest of the study.  For each subject, measurement on the same arm 
(right or left) using the same method (either automated or manual) should occur throughout the 
study .   All blood pressure measurements should be obtained with the subject in the sitting 
position, after the subject is at rest for 5 minutes . 
For purposes of qualifying any given subject for study participation based on 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria , out-of- range results  may be repeated once  at Screening and once at 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 34 of 61 Baseline. Eligibility must be confirmed at Baseline.  Additional vital signs measurements may be 
performed as deemed medically necessary by the Investigator. 
8.7 Electrocardiograms 
Single  12-lead ECGs will be performed at every clinic visit excep t the Week 14 Follow -up Visit, 
as Visit as specified in the  Schedule of Assessments .  
ECGs should be obtained after the subject has been resting comfortably in a supine position for 
approximately 5 minutes.  ECGs will be collected prior to blood collection  whenever possible. 
ECGs  will be  assessed locally for eligibility determinations and safety, and electronic tracings 
will also be sent to a central reader for review.  All ECG tra ces will be kept as source data.  
For purposes of qualifying any given subject for study participation based on 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria , the ECG may be repeated once in the case of clinically significant 
out-of- range results . The ECG may be repeated im mediately or later within the visit.  
8.8 Laboratory Assessments 
Appendix 16.2 Clinical Laboratory Analytes  provides a list of the clinical laboratory tests that 
will be performed according to the collection schedule provided in the Schedule of Assessments .   
Blood samples for chemistry , hematology  and lipid testing  and urine samples will be collected in 
accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures .  Blood samples fo r chemistry , hematology 
and lipid testing   performed on Day 1 and Week 13 require an 8 hour fast and will include 
glucose testing; samples obtained at all other visits do not require fasting and will not include 
glucose or lipid testing.   
A central laboratory will be used to analyze the clinical laboratory samples.  
8.9 Management of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Tests 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all lab tests as they become available 
and to document their review by signing and dating the lab report.  For each lab test outside of the laboratory normal range, the Investigator must ascertain if this is a clinically significant 
change from baseline for the individual subject.  This determination does not necessarily need to be mad e the first time an abnormal lab is observed .  The Investigator may repeat the lab test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original lab test.  
All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring during the study that were not 
present at baseline should be reported as AEs, and followed and evaluated with additional tests if necessary until determination  of the underlying cause or adverse event resolution. 
8.10 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS) 
The Columbia Suicide Seve rity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is a prospective assessment instrument 
that directly classifies suicidal ideation and behavior into 11 preferred categories.8  The C -SSRS 
involves a series of probing questions to inquire about possible suicidal thinking and behavior. 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 35 of 61 The C -SSRS will be conducted Screening , Baseline, Week 1 and Week 4, as specified in  the 
Schedule of Assessments . 
At Screening, a subject is ineligible for the study if the subjec t scores a suicidal ideation intensity 
of 3 or higher (per the C-SSRS) or has exhibited any suicidal behavior within the past three 
months. 
If a subject scores an intensity of 3 or higher for suicidal ideation (per the C -SSRS)  during the 
Treatment and Fol low-Up Visits a suicide risk assessment must be completed by the investigator.  
If a subject scores an intensity of 3 or higher for suicidal ideation and has any suicidal behavior, 
the subject will be  discontinued from the study and referred  for psychiatri c evaluation.  
8.11 Additional Safety Measures 
Subjects and caregivers will be instructed to inform the study physician and/or research 
personnel of any AEs  that occur at any time during the study.  
 Procedures will be completed as specified in this protocol unle ss contraindicated due to a 
reported AE.  If, in the judgement of the Investigator, additional testing is required to assess an adverse event or otherwise clinically significant event, this testing should be discussed first with the sponsor unless needed urgently.   
8.12 Cognitive Battery 
At Screening, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status -Delayed 
Memory Index  (RBANS DMI), Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating 
(CDR), and the Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale (MHIS) will be used to assess the cognitive status of the subject.  During the Baseline Visit, the subjects will be reassessed on RBANS and MMSE. Caregivers  
will also complete  the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living 
Inventory (ADCS- ADL) . 
 The subjects will be assessed with the RBANS and MMSE instruments at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 13 during the treatment period. The investigator will also assess subjects using the CGI -I scale at 
Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 13.  Caregivers will be asked to complete the ADCS -ADL at Weeks 8 and 
13.  Section 16.3 Cognitive Test Scales  provides a summary description for each of the test in the 
cognitive battery to be assessed in this  study.  
8.13 Clinical Global Impression- Improvement 
At the clinic visits during Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 13, the Investigator will assess the degree of improvement in the subject with respect to their AD on a 1-7 point scale, where:

centrifuge is not available, i t is acceptable to keep sample on wet ice prior to centrifugation and 
use an ambient centrifuge to process the sample .  The resulting plasma samples will be harvested 
and transferred into appropriately labeled polypropylene screw -cap tubes .  Pharmacokinetic 
samples will be placed in a freezer at -70°C within 60 minutes of the blood draw.  If a clinical 
site does not have a -70°C or -80°C freezer, it is acceptable to use a -20° C freezer, but samples 
stored must be shipped for storage with the laboratory vendor within 2 wee ks of collection.  
Samples will remain frozen until as sayed .  A more detailed description of plasma sample 
preparation requirements may be provided by the analytical laboratory and will supersede those 
provided in this protocol.  Appropriate documentation will be placed in the study master file  at 
the Clinical Site . 
The samples will be transferred to the central  laboratory for storage after completion of the study 
or at mutually agreed upon time points during the clinical conduct of the study.  Prior to shipment, the samples will be appropriately packed in a Styrofoam cooler containing dry ice.  Sufficient dry ice will be added to ensure that the samples will remain frozen for at least 72 hours for remote shipments.  The shipment will be accompanied by documentation containing the following information: name of  the study drug product, protocol number, number of subjects, 
and number of samples included in the shipment.

tube will be retained as whole blood. The plasma and whole blood tubes for biomarker use will be placed in a freezer at -70°C within 60 minutes of the blood draw. If a clinical site does not 
have a -70°C or -80°C freezer, it is acceptable to use a -20°C freezer, but samples stored must be 
shipped for storage  with the laboratory vendor within 2 weeks of collection. These biomarker samples will be retained and may be utilized subsequently for biomarker assessment.   
9 EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disea se temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the 
investigational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered 
problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on t he appropriate eCRF.  
Adverse events, which include abnormal and clinically significant clinical laboratory test 
variables, will be monitored and documented from the time Informed Consent  until study 
participation is complete (the Follow -up Visit). Subjects  should be instructed to report any 
adverse event that they experience to the Investigator. Any medical condition present prior to 
consent should be recorded in medical history. Beginning with the signing of the informed 
consent until the time of the first dose of study drug, investigators should make updates to source 
record s to document  any pre -existing medical condition or signs or symptoms that change  in 
severity, frequency, or seriousness in the medical history ; if the subject is su bsequently 
randomized, these occurrences  will be reported as adverse event s that began prior to dosing. 
Serious adverse events that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be reported 
similarly, except that an  SAE re port will be completed regar dless of whether the subject is 
randomized..  
Beginning with the first dose of study drug , investigators should make an assessment for adverse 
events at each visit and record all adverse events, non -serious and serious, on the appropriate 
adverse event eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorded on t he eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure. 
Concomitant procedures should be recorded as such on the appropriate eCRF.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or other examinations (e.g., ECG) that are 
detected after the fir st dose of study drug  and worsen during the study should be reported as 
adverse events. An abnormal laboratory result that is not verified by repeat testing does not 
necessitate reporting as an adverse event. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical, 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 39 of 61 scientific, and clinical judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal lab oratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event. 
Treatment of any adverse reactions will be evaluated and managed by a physician.  
9.2 Definitions 
9.2.1 Adverse Drug Reaction  
For adverse events with a causal relationship to study drug, follow-up by the Investigator will be 
required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize to a level acceptable to the Investigator. 
9.2.2 Unexpected  Adverse Event/ Unexpected  Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected AE/unexpected suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse 
reaction that is not listed in the Investigator Brochure
 or is not listed at the specificity or severity 
that has been observed; or, if an Investigator Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the cur rent application, as amended. 
9.2.3 Serious Adverse Event s  
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse event;  
• NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in view 
of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject  at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe f orm, might 
have caused death. 
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations; 
NOTE: Any hospital admission with at least one overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as adverse events and assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons (i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will not be considered inpatient hospitalization s.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• An important medical event.  
NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 40 of 61 judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
9.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator 
9.3.1 Causality/Relatedness  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed by the Investigator according to the following definitions: 
Not Related  (unlikely r elated, unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and /or another cause (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, the rapies, and 
complications) is suspected. 
Related  (possibly related, related) – The time course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, therapies, and complications) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  The following factors should also be considered: 
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - The event should occur after 
the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be eval uated in the clinical context of the event. 
• Underlying, concomitant diseases (medical history) -   Each report should be 
evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject  may have.  
• Conc omitant drug - The other drugs the subject  is taking or the treatment the subject  
receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - Clinic al and/or preclinical data 
may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - The exposure to stress might induce 
adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explan ation for the 
event.  
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 41 of 61 • The pharmacology and PK of the study drug - The known pharmacologic properties 
(absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be 
considered. 
9.3.2 Severity  
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the sev erity ( intensity ) of each adverse event as 
mild, moderate, or severe according to the following definitions: 
Mild  – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
It should be noted that a severe AE need not be serious and that a serious adverse event (SAE) 
need not, by definition, be severe. 
9.3.3 Adverse Event Monitoring and Follow- up 
Subjects who experience AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and 
laboratory tests, as determined by the Investigator .  In accordance with good medical practice, all 
AEs m ust be followed to satisfactory resolution or stabilization of the event(s), or, if a chronic 
condition, until fully characterized.  All follow -up results are to be reported to the Sponsor.  Any 
actions taken and follow -up results must be recorded either on the appropriate page of the CRF 
or in a follow -up letter to the Sponsor, as well as in the subject’s source documentation.  Follow-
up laboratory results should be filed with the subject’s source documentation.   
For all AEs that require the subject to be  discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
Subjects who have non- serious AEs that are ongoing at study completion or study withdrawal 
must be followed until resolution of the AEs or for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, 
whichever comes first .  Subjects who have an ongoing SAE at study completion or study 
withdrawal must be followed until the event resolves or the event or sequela stabilizes. 
9.3.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
From the time of informed consent until 30 days following  the last administration of study drug 
The Investigator or designee will notify the sponsor contact and clinical research organization 
(CRO) within 24 hours  after the SAE detection, observation, or report of occurrence (regardless 
of the relationship to study treatment) .  The Sponsor and the CRO medical monitor contact 
information for SAE reporting is provided below .

 If the AE was fatal or life -threatening  
 Cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study drug) 
 Autopsy findings (if available) 
The Investigator must continue to follow the subject  until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the subject  dies. Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update 
the Sponsor  and submit any supporting documentation (e.g., subject  discharge summary or 
autopsy reports). 
Any new SAE that occurs within one month after the study period and is considered to be 
possibly related to the investigational product  should be recorded and reported immediately to 
the Sponsor.   
All serious event reporting will adhere to Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), specifically 21 
CFR 312.32 (7- and 15- day alerts) for  Investigational New Drugs  (IND).  The clinical research 
site will be responsible for reporting SAEs to the Institutiona l Review Board (IRB) per FDA 
regulations.  The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting and processing any SAEs to the FDA 
or other applicable regulatory agency. 
9.4  Data Safety and Monitoring Committee 
An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will provide safety oversight for this 
study.  The DSMB will consist of two qualified MDs and one statistician.  The DSMB will review standard safety data approximately every four (4) months, based on enrollment rate.  A

listings, summaries and analyses.  
9.5 Reports of Pregnancy 
If a subject or partner of a subject participating in the study becomes pregnant during the study or within 30 days of discontinuing study drug, the Investigator should report the pregnancy to the Sponsor within 24 hours of being notified. Investigator will complete then forward the Exposure In Utero form to the Sponsor.   
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study 
and early termination study procedures will be performed.  
The subject  should be followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the 
Sponsor. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.

11 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 Sample Size  
The BPN14770- CNS -201 study will enroll 255 subjects (85 per treatment arm), in anticipation of 
evaluating at least 240 subjects (80 per treatment).   The Primary Efficacy Outcome measure will 
be change from baseline at Week 13  for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
Neurological Status - Delayed Memory Index (RBANS DMI).    
 The normalized mean of the RBANS DMI is 100, with an SD of 15, and the test- retest reliability 
is 0.80 with no practice effects using alternate versions of the test.
9   RBANS DMI was used in a 
recent natural history study of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to probable AD.16 In the 
large amnestic MCI sample (81 subjects), the mean was 73.4 with a SD of 16.5 in a normal distribution.  Performance of healthy, age-matched controls was a mean of 101.4 with a SD of 
14.4 (81 subjects) yielding estimates of the standard deviation for the DMI from 14.4-16.5.    Therefore, the power analysis is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the 
response variable is 16.    
The power of the proposed study is driven by the assumed difference between BPN14770 25mg (higher dose) and placebo.  Based on randomization of 80 patients per group into the parallel -
design study, the probabi lity is 80 percent that the study will detect a treatment difference at a 
two-sided 0.05 significance level, if the true difference between BPN14770 25 mg and placebo is 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 48 of 61 7.15 units. Using the standardized mean difference (SMD) to estimate effect size,17 a change of 
7.15 units on the DMI score is an effect size of 0.45. 
   Table 1 provides sample size estimates for 80 percent and 90 percent probability that the study will detect a treatment difference at a two -sided 0.05 significance level  assuming the standard 
deviation of the DMI is 16.  
Table 1 Clinical Sample Size (1:1 Active + Placebo) Based on Effect Size (Change From Baseline) And Desired 
Powe r 
 Number of Subjects Per Group Based on Desired Effect Size (SMD)  
Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)  0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.75 
RBANS DMI change (M1 -M2) 4.8 5.6 6.4 7.2 8 12 
Number of Subjects (Power 0.8)  176 130 100 79 64 29 
Number of Subjects (Powe r 0.9)  235 173 133 105 86 39 
  For comparison, a donepezil study reported by Seltzer et al., 2004, randomized a total of 153 subjects (2:1 active vs placebo) and reported treatment benefit at a significance level of 0. 03 after 
12 weeks of treatment.
 18   In a larger study of mild -to-moderate AD patients, the effect size of 
donepezil reported by Rogers et al. 1998 was 0.4,19 so the assumption of an effect size of 0.45  
for BPN14770 in a milder, early AD population, using a sensitive outcome measure, is reasonable.   
 
Therefore, based on clinical trials of donepezil in a similar population, the proposed sample size 
will provide adequate power to detect a clinically and s tatistically significant difference of 
BPN14770 treatment in early AD. 
11.2 Demographics 
Summary statistics [number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum] will be tabulated for the observed values for all continuous demographic parame ters.  
Frequencies and percentages will be tabulated for categorical data.  
11.3 Analysis Populations 
The primary efficacy population will be the intent to treat (ITT) efficacy population, which will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at least one follow-up visit. The per protocol (PP) population (randomized subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at least one follow- up visit with no significant 
protocol violations) and the completers (CP) population (randomized subjects who completed all 13 weeks of treatment with no significant protocol violations) will be used to evaluate the robustness of the ITT results. 
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment.

Page 49 of 61 11.4 Efficacy: Cognitive Testing Analysis 
Change from baseline will be calculated for the primary and secondary efficacy parameters at 
each time point and descriptive statistics provided for each time point. Summary plot s of these 
data will also be provided. For RBANS DMI and total score , MMSE  score, and ADCS -ADL  
total score , pairwise differences in change from baseline between the treatment groups (10 mg vs 
25 mg BPN14770, 10 mg BPN14770 vs Placebo, 25 mg BPN14770 vs Pla cebo) will be assessed 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that includes baseline as a covariate and factors for week, site and treatment  and the interaction term for week and treatment  ; the 
pairwise differences will be assessed at each time po int.  CDR sum of boxes will be analyzed in 
the same manner .  
Change from baseline in the other RBANS index scores (immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, attention, language) will be summarized by time point, with descriptive statistics provided.  
The composite endpoint will be based on the AD Composite Score (ADCOMS) , a composite 
clinical outcome for prodromal Alzheimer's disease trials .
20 The composite endpoint and analysis 
model will be fully specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
The efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT, PP and CP analysis populations. 
Supplemental analyses assessing treatment effect relative to severity of disease based on baseline MMSE score may also be performed.  
11.5 Safety Analysis 
Safety analysis will be based on all subjects receiving at least one dose of study medication.  Treatment emergent AEs will be summarized  based on the frequency of AEs and their severity 
for all dosed subjects.  All AEs will be coded using  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA ) and summarized by treatment group and for the combined BPN14770 groups  using 
preferred term and pri mary system organ class.  Overall s afety and tolerability will be assessed 
by clinical and/or statistical review of all safety parameters including adverse experiences, laboratory values, vital signs, physical exams, C -SSRS, and ECG data.  General clinical  and 
laboratory adverse events will be presented in frequency tables.  Summary statistics (n, mean, SD, median, and range (minimum, maximum) will be tabulated for the observed values and the change (or percent change) from baseline for all continuous parameters for vital signs, ECG, and laboratory tests.  
For each AE, the difference in incidence rates between each BPN14770 dose group will be 
compared to the placebo group using a Fisher’s exact test.   
11.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
BPN14770 plasma levels will be presented in tabular form by study arm, dose level and subject.

Page 52 of 61 The Investigator, or a person delegated the responsibility by the Investigator, must ensure that 
each study subject (or legally acceptable representative) is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives o f the study and possible risks associated with participatio n and must ensure that the 
subject has been informed of his/her rights to privacy. The Investigator or delegate will allow the 
subject  (or legally acceptable representative) adequate opportunity to read the written informed 
consent and ask any questions. The Investigator will obtain written informed consent from each subject  (or legally acceptable representative) before any study -specific activity is performed and 
should document in the source documentation that consent was obtained prior to any study -
specific activity. If consent is signed by a legally authorized representative, the subject must 
provide verbal assent, which will be documented on the consent form. The  original signed copy 
of the ICF must be maintained by the Investigator and is subject to inspection by a representative of the Sponsor, their representatives, auditors, the IRB/EC and/or regulatory agencies. A copy of the sign ed ICF will be given to the subject. 
13.4 Study Monitoring  
The role  of the study monitor is to verify the rights and well- being of the subject s are protected, 
the data is accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents, and the conduct of the study is in compliance with the protocol, Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, 
the Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized and easily retrievable data. Before the enro llment of any subject in this study, the Sponsor or their designee will review with 
the Investigator and site personnel the following documents: Clinical P rotocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed consent process, management of investigational product, and the procedure for reporting adverse events such as SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor or their designee to monitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is entered by the site, the CRA will r eview the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, 
and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent  
to investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by signature and date on the study -specific monitoring log 
and findings documented in a follow- up letter.  
It is important that the Investigator and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the proces s.

16.3.1 RBANS  
The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) is a brief, 
individually administered test measuring attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, 
and immediate and delayed memory.9 It consists of 12 subtests, which yield five Index scores and 
a Total Scale score.  
16.3.2 MMSE  
The Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE)  is a 30 -point questionnaire that is used extensively 
in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is commonly used to screen for dementia.
10 It consists of a series of questions and tests, each of which scores points if 
answered correctly. The MMSE tests a number of different mental abilities, including a person's memory, attention and language. 
16.3.3 ADCS -ADL  
The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study scale for ADL (ADCS - ADL)
10,11  is administered by 
an independent rater. The interview was developed to assess impairment of everyday tasks in non-
demented individuals with high sensitivity.  
16.3.4 CDR  
The Washingt on University Clinical Dementia Rating scale12,13 is a structured, clinician -rated 
interview that collects information on cognitive capacity from both the collateral source and 
patient for the evaluation of staging severity of dementia. The CDR was developed primarily to assess severity level in persons with dementia but it can be used to stage dementia in other illnesses as well (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Six domains are assessed and then synthesized to assign a Global CDR score. The domains are memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Impairment is defined only when caused by cognitive loss rather than by physical disability or other non- cognitive factors. Severity ratings 
range along a 5 -point scale (except for the personal care domain) : 
• CDR -0: no cognitive impairment 
• CDR -0.5: questionable or very mild dementia 
• CDR -1: mild  
• CDR -2: moderate 
• CDR -3: severe  
 The CDR is frequently utilized in clinical and research settings to describe stage -dependent 
features of dementia and for use as a clinically -meaningful outcome measure in clinical drug trials.  
 
16.3.5 Modified Hachinski Ischemia Score (MHIS)  
A modified version of the Ischemic Score of Hachinski us es 4 items of Hachinski's I schemic S core 
plus CT findings (if available in subject’s history)  as a suitable tool for the diagnosis of vascular

Page 61 of 61 dementia.14,15 Such a modified ischemic score could comprise 5 items, that is, 4 relevant items of 
Ischemic Score and the CT features ( if available ). 
1. Abrupt onset (2 points) 
2. History of stroke (1 point) 
3. Focal neurological symptoms  (2 points) 
4. Focal neurological signs  (2 points) 
5. CT-Low density areas isolated (2 points) or  multiple  (3 points) 
 Maximum Total Score = 10  
A 9-10 point total score points to the existence of old or recent cerebrovascular lesions, simple or 
multiple.

4 1.  Background 
 
1.1 Salivary Gland Carcinoma 
 Salivary gland cancers (SGC) are rare neoplasm s, constituting approximately 5% of head 
and neck cancers, with an overall incidence of 1-3 per 100,000 persons.  There are multiple histological subtypes including adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.  The biologic behavior of these cancers is quite variable [Laurie].  Initial therapy for patients who present with localized disease consists of surgery and/or radiation therapy.  Neutron beam radiotherapy has been demonstrated to have superior efficacy to conventional radiotherapy for the treatment of localized 
disease [Griffin].  As the University of Washington is one of only a few neutron facilities 
operating worldwide, it has become a referral center for the treatment of this rare 
neoplasm.  Despite optimal treatment, many patients progress either locally or with 
distant metastatic disease.  Due to the rare nature of this disease, conducting clinical trials is difficult; therefore there is li mited clinical trial data to guide systemic 
therapeutic treatments.   
 
1.2  Systemic therapy for advanced  refractory and metastatic SGC 
 
There is no current standard of care for palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced SGC.   A recent review cited 12 sm all trials reporting the use of chemotherapy 
for salivary gland carcinomas [Laurie].   In general, objective responses to any cytotoxic 
agent or regimen are infrequent and stabilization of disease is more commonly observed. 
Agents with activity include cisplatin, mitoxantrone, vinorelbine, epirubicin, and 
paclitaxel.   Combination chemotherapy also appears to be effective. The only randomized clinical trial done in this cancer demonstrated a higher response rate with cisplatin and vinorelbine compared to vinorelbine alone [Airoldi].  Data is insufficient to 
conclude that combination chemotherapy is superior to single agent therapy and 
combination therapy certainly has more toxicity.  Despite scientific rationale for the use of molecular targeted agents such as imat inib (c-kit) [Hotte], gefitinib (EGFR), and 
trastuzumab (HER2) [Agulnik], the results of these agents in phase II clinical trials have been disappointing. 
 1.3  Eribulin 

Eribulin mesylate is a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor. Eribulin mesylate is a 
synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, a product isolated from the marine sponge 
Halichondria okadai .  
 Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects via a 

Version date: Dec 18, 2012 
5 tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of 
mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage. 
 In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration approved eribulin mesylate under the trade name HALAVEN for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer who have 
previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of 
metastatic disease. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. 
2.  Rationale 
Patients with locally advanced refractory or metastatic salivary gland cancers have limited treatment options.  
This trial has the potential to benefit patients with salivary gland cancers by improving 
treatment options.  Due to the relative rarity of this disease, this has been an 
underserved population and is difficult to conduct adequately powered clinical trials. Additionally, pharmaceutical companies have not pursued drug development in this disease since it is not considered commercially viable.  
3.  Trial Objectives 
  Primary:  
x Evaluate the response rate of eribulin per RECIST criteria in patients with locally 
advanced refractory or metastatic SGC. 
 
Secondary: 
x Determine the safety and toxicity of eribulin in patients with locally advanced 
refractory or metastatic SGC.  
x Evaluate the duration of response and time-to-progression. 
 
Exploratory:  
x Evaluate overall survival. 
 
4.  Trial Design 
 
This is an open-label, single-center, phase II study of eribulin for patients with locally advanced refractory or metastatic SGC. 
 
Patients will receive eribulin 1.4 mg/m
2 administered intravenously (IV push) over 2 to 5 
minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Treatment will be continued until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent.  7674IRB Approved

6 5.  Subject Selection 
 
5.1  Inclusion Criteria 
 Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following 
criteria: 
x Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented salivary gland 
cancers. Patients that do not have a salivary gland primary must have one of the 
following histologies - adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma).  
x Patients must have recurrent and/or metastatic disease that is progressive and not 
amenable to surgery or curative radiotherapy occurring within 6 months of study 
entry, as evidenced by: at least a 20% increase in radiographically or clinically 
measurable disease, appearance of any new lesions, or deterioration in clinical 
status. 
x Age > 18 years. 
x ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. 
x Patients with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria [Eisenhauer].  
o At least one lesion of ≥ 1.5 cm in long-axis diameter for nonlymph nodes or 
≥ 1.5 cm in short-axis diameter for lymph nodes which is serially measurable 
according to RECIST 1.1 using either  computerized tomography (CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  
o Lesions that have had radiotherapy must show evidence of progressive 
disease (PD) based on RECIST 1.1 to be deemed a target lesion. 
x Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: 
o absolute neutrophil count >1,500/ μL 
o platelets >100,000/ μL 
o creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min

8 6.2 Treating the Patient 
6.2.1 Conditions patients must meet prior to administering any treatment on 
Day 1 and 8 of each cycle  
Prior to receiving any study treatment on Day 1 or 8 of each cycle, the patient must have 
all of the following criteria met: 
x Neutrophils are > 1.0 X 109/L, 
x Platelets > 75 X 109/L, 
x No grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities. 
 The Day 8 dose may be delayed for a maximum of 1 week. 
x If toxicities do not resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by Day 15, omit the 
dose. 
x If toxicities resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by Day 15, administer eribulin 
at a reduced dose and initiate the next cycle no sooner than 2 weeks later. 
 Blood tests should be performed before starting any study treatment administration and 
if the above criteria are not met, treatment should be delayed until the criteria for start 
of treatment are met. If a delay of > 3 weeks (one cycle) is required, the patient should be removed from the study and continue to be treated in accordance with the Investigator’s standard clinical practice.  6.2.2 Eribulin administration 
Patients will receive eribulin 1.4 mg/m
2 administered intravenously (IV push) over 2 to 5 
minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Treatment will be continued until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdraws consent. 
 
Guidelines for dose modification and dose interruption of study drug are described in Table 6-1.  
6.2.3 Dose Modi fications   
Any dose reduction or dose delay of study drug  is based upon the severity of toxicity, as 
graded by NCI Clinical Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTCAE, version 4.0). Once a dose has been reduced during a treatment cycle, re-escalation will not be permitted during any subsequent cycles. 
 
All toxicity-related causes for dose reductions or dose delays, must be recorded as an AE. Please refer to Table 6-1 for recommended study drug dose adjustments. Patients requiring a delay in study treatment > 3 weeks or > 2 dose reductions, will be discontinued from study treatment.

11 7.5  Subject Withdrawal  
Patients will be removed from study if they present with disease progression, as 
defined by radiological RECIST 1.1 criteria. Subjects will also be removed from study if 
they require more than two dose level reductions. Subjects will also be removed from 
study if they require more than 3 weeks to recover from adverse events. Patients may 
withdraw consent at any time.   
8.  Assessments  
The schedule of assessments is presented in Appendix 1. The description of assessments 
is provided in Section 7.  
8.1  Efficacy Assessments  
Patients will have their tumors assessed for response by conventional imaging methods 
(typically CT scans), which will be performed at baseline (at least 30 days prior to the 
first study drug dose) and than at least every 2 cycles (~ every 6 weeks) after initial dose. 
Once patients have completed 4 cycles of therapy, they can have CT scans after every 3 cycles.  
8.1.1  Definition of Measurable Disease 
 
Measurable disease: the presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥10 mm with spiral CT 
scan for non-lymph nodes or ≥ 1.5 cm in short-axis diameter for lymph nodes 
 
Non-measurable disease: all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 
mm with spiral CT scan).   8.1.2  Baseline Documentation of Tumor Burden 
 
x Target lesions: All measurable lesions should be identified and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements (either by imaging techniques  or clinically). A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum longest diameter (SLD). The baseline SLD will be used as the reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response. 
 
x Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these 
lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
8.1.3  Response Criteria   
 
7674IRB Approved 
Document Release Date: 02/14/2018
Printed on 5/14/2018
Version date: Dec 18, 2012 
12 Radiological response will be defined as per the RECIST criteria . Treatment outcomes will 
be defined as: 
x Complete response (CR): complete resolution of all tumor lesions. 
x Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter 
of the target lesions (primary tumor and lymph nodes).  
x Stable disease (SD): patients with changes that would not qualify as partial 
responses or progressive diseases.    
x Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest 
diameter of the target lesions. 
 
8.2  Time-to-Event Measures  The following definitions for time-to-event measures will apply: 
 
x Duration of Tumor Response is measured from the date of the first objective 
assessment of PR or CR to the first date of disease relapse or death from any 
cause.  
x Time to Progression is measured from the date of enrollment to the first date of 
radiographic progression of disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
 
9.  Adverse Event Reporting 
9.1  Adverse Events  
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this 
study and for alerting the Cancer Consortium IRB to any event that seems unusual in 
accordance with IRB policy. The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical 
care of patients during the study. The investigator remains responsible to follow, through an appropriate health care option, adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before completing the study. The patient should be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. Frequency of follow-up is left to the discretion of the 
investigator. 
 Safety measurements that will be used in the study include physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and blood chemistries). The adverse event will be graded for toxicity using the NCI CTC version 4.0. Toxicity assessment will occur at each monthly treatment visit, see Schedule of Events, Appendix 1. Any adverse events leading to a treatment interruption or dose reduction along with all adverse events that are 
grade 3 and higher will be recorded in the CRF. 

9.2  Definition of an Adverse Event  

The definitions of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) are given 
below.

13 An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a 
pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e .g., nausea, chest pain ), or signs (e.g., 
tachycardia, enlarged liver).   
 
9.3  Serious Adverse Events  
An event that fulfills at least one of the following criteria will be designated a serious 
adverse event (SAE). SAEs will be reported  to the Cancer Consortium IRB per Cancer 
Consortium policy/procedure.  
x Results in death 
x Requires initial inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
x Is immediately life-threatening  
x Results in severe or permanent disability or incapacity 
x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
x Any other important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or requires 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
Any events that are unequivocally due to  progression of disease should not be 
reported as a serious adverse event. 

9.4Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
 Adverse events will be collected after the patient has taken the first dose of study drug. After discontinuation from treatment, patients must be followed for all existing AEs for 
30 calendar days after the last dose of study drug or until another anti-cancer therapy is 
initiated.   
Prior to beginning study treatment, study site personnel will note the occurrence and 
nature of each patient’s medical condition(s). During the study, site personnel will again note any change in the condition(s) and/or the occurrence and nature of any adverse events. Toxicities are to be graded according to the NCI CTC version 4.0.   A description of the event, including its date of onset and resolution, any action taken should be provided along with the investigator’s assessment of causality. An event that is due to unequivocal progression of disease should not be reported as an AE. Any adverse events leading to a treatment interruption or dose reduction along with all grades 3 and 
higher adverse events must be recorded on a case report form (CRF).  
 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after 
the patient has initiated study therapy and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study treatment must be reported to Eisai within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs experienced after this 30-day period should only be reported to Eisai if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.

10.1  Sample Size Determination 
This is an open-label single-arm phase II study.  We will utilize the optimal two-stage 
Simon design, which minimizes the expected number of patients enrolled under the null hypothesis and given various other assumptions [Simon].  The null hypothesis is that the true response rate is 5% and the alternative hypothesis is that the true response rate is 20%.  If we additionally set the significance le vel to 0.05 (or less) and the power to be at 
least 80% (p0 = 0.05, p1 = 0.20, a = 0.05, b = 0. 20), then Simon’s design dictates that 10 
subjects be treated in the first stage.  If there are no responses among these 10, the study will be terminated due to lack of effica cy (i.e., this will be considered reasonably 
strong evidence against the alternative hypothesis that the response rate is 20% or more). 
If at least one response is observed among these 10, an additional 19 subjects will be 
recruited for a total of 29 subjects.  If 3 or fewer responses are seen among the 29 (an observed response rate of 10.3% or less), the regimen will be deemed to be not sufficiently efficacious for further study.  Four or more responses among the 29 will be viewed as sufficient evidence to deem the regimen as potentially efficacious (i.e., 
reasonably strong evidence that the true response rate is greater than 5%).  The expected number of patients to be enrolle d under the null hypothesis that the true 
response rate is 5% is 17.6, and the probabilit y of terminating early in this scenario (after 
the first stage, i.e., if no responses are seen in the first 10 patients) is 0.60.   
 
10.2 Efficacy Analysis  
The primary endpoint will be overall response rate. As noted above, 4 or more observed 
responses among 29 patients would be considered potentially efficacious and would 
justify further study. Responses include both complete and partial responses, as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Duration of response and time to progression  will be reported as 
median values.  The disease control rate (DCR ), defined as the stable disease + partial 
response rate will be calculated.  Toxicity rates will be described as the overall percentage of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity. 
 
10.3 Analysis of Other Endpoints  
Demographic characteristics such as patient age, gender, tumor type, and ECOG 
performance status will be tabulated.  All continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
values).  All categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  
Study drug administration will be described in terms of the total number of months 
administered, the median (range) of months administered, dose intensity, dose modifications, and reasons for the deviations from planned therapy.

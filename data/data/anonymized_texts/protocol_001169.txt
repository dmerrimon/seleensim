 SYNOPSIS 
Name of Spo n
sor/Company: Bausch + Lomb Incorporated  
Name of Investigational Product:   
Test: Bausch + Lomb kalifilcon A daily disposable contact lens 
Control:  Bausch + Lomb Biotrue ONE day daily disposable contact lens  
Title of Study:  A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of a kalifilcon A Contact 
Lens for Daily Disposable Use  
Number of Clinical Centers:  Approximately 20 investigative sites, United States only  
Primary Objective:  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new silicone 
hydrogel daily disposable contact lens, kalifilcon A compared to the Bausch + Lomb 
Biotrue ONE day® daily disposable contact lens when worn by current soft contact lens 
wearers on a daily disposable wear basis.  
Methodology:  The study is evaluating the safety, efficacy and product performance of 
an investigational silicone hydrogen contact lens. Silicone hydrogel contact lenses offer 
the advantage of high oxygen transmissibility compared to non-silicone hydrogel soft 
contact lenses, promoting the level of health of the eye.  
 
Approximately 247 subjects (494 eyes) will be enrolled in this three-month, two arm, 
1:1, randomized, parallel, bilateral, single-masked study at approximately 20 
investigative sites in the United States.  In order to use this study for submission to the 
Japanese regulatory agency, a minimum of 20% of the randomized subjects will be of 
Japanese descent (i.e., both maternal and paternal grandparents born in Japan).   
 
Subjects will be assigned randomization numbers sequentially as they are enrolled and 
deemed eligible to participate.  Randomization will be stratified by cohort (Japanese, 
non-Japanese) and by investigational site.  Japanese descent will be documented by 
Family Tree Worksheet that is kept with the subject’s source documents.  Lenses will be 
dispensed according to subject-specific randomization schedules provided to the 
unmasked designee at each site.  
Number of Subjects Planned:  Approximately 247 subjects (494 eyes), with a minimum 
of 20% of subjects being of Japanese descent (i.e., both maternal and paternal 
grandparents born in Japan).  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: 
• Subjects must be 18 to 55 years old on the date the ICF is signed and have capacity 
to provide voluntary informed consent.  
• Subjects must be myopic and require lens correction from -0.25 to -6.00 Diopter 
(D) with 0.25 D steps, in each eye. 
• Subjects must be correctable through spherocylindrical refraction and with soft 
spherical contact lenses to 40 letters (0.14 logarithm of the minimum angle of 
resolution [logMAR]) or better (2 meters distance, high-contrast chart) in each eye.  
• Subjects must be adapted soft contact lens wearers and willing to wear their study 
lenses for at least 8 hours per day at least 5 days per week on a daily disposable 
wear basis for approximately 3 months.  
Key Exclusion Criteria:  
• Subjects participating in any drug or device clinical investigation within 2 weeks 
prior to entry into this study (Screening/Dispensing Visit) and/or during the period 
of study participation.  
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 5 of 79 
  
 • Subjects who have worn gas permeable (GP) contact lenses within the last 30 days 
or who h a
ve worn polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses within the last three 
months.  
• Subjects with an active ocular disease or who are using any ocular medication. 
• Subjects who currently wear monovision, multifocal, or toric contact lenses.  
• Subjects with an ocular astigmatism of greater than 1.00 D in either eye. 
• Subjects with anisometropia (spherical equivalent) of greater than 2.00 D. 
• Subjects who are amblyopic. 
• Subjects who have had any corneal surgery (e.g., refractive surgery).  
Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration: 
The investigator or designee will instruct all subjects to adhere to the Subject Instructions 
provided with their study contact lenses. 
 
In order to ensure that the investigator and site staff remain masked to the study lens, an 
unmasked designee at each site will be responsible for all study lens accountability, 
including dispensation and collection of study supplies to subjects.  
 
Subjects are to be instructed not to discuss or show the dispensed study lenses to the 
Investigator or masked site staff during the study. 
 
Subjects will be instructed that other contact lenses (other than the study lenses) and 
contact lens care products (other than the drops provided) are not allowed to be used 
during the study period.   
Study Duration of Treatment:  approximately 3 months  
Schedule of Visits:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
The primary endpoints are as follows: 
Effectiveness: 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 6 of 79 
  
 The primary effectiveness endpoint will be contact lens corrected distance high-contrast 
VA averaged
 over all scheduled visits. 
Safety: 
The primary safety endpoint will be any slit lamp finding greater than Grade 2 over the 
course o f the study.  
Statistical Methods: 
Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics: sample size (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Categorical data will be 
presented using the total counts for each category and corresponding percentages. The 
denominator for each percentage will be the number of subjects or eyes with non-missing 
data at the given visit for each respective study treatment, unless otherwise indicated. 
 
Monocular distance high-contrast VA will be assessed while wearing the study lens at 
the Screening/Dispensing visit and all scheduled follow-up visits. For each eye visit, the 
number of letters read correctly will be recorded in the case report form. The number of 
letters read correctly will be converted to a logMAR value. For each eye, the average of 
the non-missing logMAR VA values at the scheduled visits (Screening/Dispensing and 
follow-up visits) will be computed. 
 
The average of the non-missing logMAR VA values at scheduled visits 
(screening/dispensing and all follow-up visits) will be summarized using continuous 
summary statistics for the PP Population in a table at the eye level. An analysis of 
variance model will be constructed using the PP Population with a response variable of 
average logMAR VA and fixed factors of treatment and site. The least squares mean and 
standard error will be displayed by treatment group in a table. In addition, the least 
squares mean difference between treatment groups (test minus control) will be displayed. 
An upper one-sided 95% confidence limit for the difference between treatment groups 
will be presented. If the confidence limit is less than 0.06, then the null hypothesis that 
the Test lens is not non-inferior to the Control lens will be rejected, and the Test lens 
will be statistically successful in this outcome. 
 
At each follow-up visit, graded slit lamp findings will be assessed for each eye using 
Grades 0 through 4. Using only the non-missing observations from all visits without 
imputation, each eye will be classified with respect to findings greater than Grade 2 at 
any visit (Absent, Present). Missing data will not be imputed. Greater than Grade 2 
findings (Absent, Present) will be summarized at the eye level by treatment using 
categorical summary statistics for the Safety Set in a table. A one-sided upper 95% 
confidence limit around the difference in “Present” proportions between the test and 
control treatment groups will be constructed using the Newcombe-Wilson score method. 
If the upper confidence limit is less than 5%, then the null hypothesis that the Test lens 
is not non-inferior will be rejected, and the Test lens will be statistically successful in 
this outcome.  
Sample Size Calculations: 
Power and sample size calculations were performed using nQuery software version 7.0 
(Statistical Solutions Ltd). 
 
In a previous study of a similar lens (Bausch + Lomb Protocol 661), the standard 
deviation of the logMAR VA averaged over all follow-up visits was 0.076. When the 
sample size in each group  (test and control)  is 222 eyes, a two group one -sided 0.0 5 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 7 of 79 
  
 significance level t-test will have 99% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test 
lens is no
t non-inferior (the difference in means, −, is 0.06 or greater) in favor of 
the altern
ative hypothesis that the test lens is non-inferior, assuming that the expected 
difference in means is 0 and the common standard deviation is 0.076.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Bausch +  
Lomb is evaluating the safety, efficacy, and product performance of an 
investigational silicone hydrogel contact lens. Silicone hydrogel contact lenses offer the 
advantage of high oxygen transmissibility compared to non-silicone hydrogel soft contact 
lenses, promoting the level of health of the eye.  
2.0 OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new silicone hydrogel 
daily disposable contact lens, kalifilcon A compared to the Bausch + Lomb Biotrue ONE 
day® daily disposable contact lens when worn by current soft contact lens wearers on a 
daily disp o
sable wear basis. 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Description of Study Design  
Approximately 247 subjects (494 eyes) will be enrolled in this three month, two arm, 1:1, 
randomized, parallel, bilateral, single-masked study at approximately 20 investigative sites 
in the United States (US). In order to use this study for submission to the Japanese 
Regulatory Agency, a minimum of 20%1 of the randomized subjects will be of Japanese 
descent (i
.e., both maternal and paternal grandparents born in Japan). Subjects will be 
assigned randomization numbers sequentially as they are enrolled and deemed eligible to 
participate. Randomization will be stratified by cohort (Japanese, non-Japanese) and 
investigational site.  Japanese descent will be documented by a Family Tree Worksheet 
that is kept with the subject’s source documents.  Lenses will be dispensed according to 
subject-specific randomization schedules provided to the unmasked designee at each site.   
At the Screening/Dispensing Visit, approximately one-half of the subjects will be 
randomized to receive Bausch + Lomb investigational kalifilcon A daily disposable contact 
lenses (Test), and approximately one-half of the subjects will be randomized to receive 
Bausch + Lomb Biotrue ONE day® daily disposable contact lenses (Control). Both groups 
will wear the assigned lenses on a daily disposable wear basis. The lenses must be replaced 
with a new lens each day or whenever a lens is removed from the eye. 
3.2 Selection of Study Population  
Recruitment for the study may start at any point after the Investigator agrees, in writing, to 
participate in the study. Written informed consent, enrollment in the study, or dispensing 
of study products cannot begin until the Investigator has received both Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and Sponsor approval to conduct the study. The Sponsor and IRB must 
approve any advertising used to recruit subjects prior to use of that advertising. 
All consented subjects must be accounted for, whether they participate in the study or not. 
Bausch + Lomb will provide a Screening Log on which to enter information for each 
subject who signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Once a potential subject is consented 
and their initials are entered onto the Screening Log, the Investigator should proceed with 
screening procedures. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 13 of 79 
  
 Potential subjects are deemed either “Screen Pass” or “Screen Fail”.  “Screen Fail” subjects 
are those  
subjects who have not met the study inclusion criteria or have met the exclusion 
criteria. “Screen Fail” subjects cannot participate in the study. Electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) must not be completed for “Screen Fail” subjects; however, the copy of their 
signed ICF and any information collected as part of screening (e.g., source documents, etc) 
must be kept in their permanent records. 
“Screen Pass” subjects are those subjects who have met all of the study inclusion criteria 
and have not met any of the exclusion criteria. Only “Screen Pass” subjects are eligible to 
participate in the study and can be assigned to a treatment using the randomization system. 
Once a subject is randomized (i.e., a treatment is assigned), a subject is considered active 
and must be accounted for at every visit until exited (completed or discontinued) from the 
study. Refer to Section 3.2.3 for subjects determined to be lost to follow-up. 
3.2.1 Eligibility 
3.2.1.1  Inclusion Criteria  
1. Subjects must be 18 to 55 years old on the date the ICF is signed.  
2. Subjects must be able to read, understand and provide written informed consent on the 
IRB approved ICF and provide authorization as appropriate for local privacy 
regulations. 
3. Subjects must be myopic and require lens correction from -0.25 to -6.00 Diopter (D) 
with 0.25 D steps, in each eye. 
4. Subjects must be correctable through spherocylindrical refraction and with soft 
spherical contact lenses to 40 letters (0.14 logarithm of the minimum angle of 
resolution [logMAR]) or better (2 meters distance, high-contrast chart) in each eye.  
5. Subjects must be free of any anterior segment disorders. 
6. Subjects must be adapted soft contact lens wearers and willing to wear their study 
lenses for at least 8 hours per day at least 5 days per week on a daily disposable wear 
basis for approximately 3 months. 
7. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with all treatment and follow-up/study 
procedures, as well as willing and able to refrain from using any other contact lenses 
or solutions other than those provided for the duration of the study. 
3.2.1.2  Exclusion Criteria 
1. Subjects participating in any drug or device clinical investigation within 2 weeks prior 
to entry into this study (Screening/Dispensing Visit) and/or during the period of study 
participation. 
2. Subjects who are women of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically 
sterilized or postmenopausal) are excluded from participation in the investigation if 
they meet any one of the following conditions: 
− she is currently pregnant 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 14 of 79 
  
 − she plans to become pregnant during the study 
− she is bre a
stfeeding 
3. Subjects who have worn gas permeable (GP) contact lenses within the last 30 days or 
who have worn polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses within the last three months.  
4. Subjects with any systemic disease currently affecting ocular health or in the 
Investigator’s opinion may have an effect on ocular health during the course of the 
study. 
5. Subjects using any systemic or topical medications that will, in the Investigator’s 
opinion, affect ocular physiology or lens performance.

Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 15 of 79 
  
 If a subject meets all the inclusion criteria and does not exhibit any of the exclusion criteria, 
the subje c
t is eligible for entry into the study. Ineligible subjects MUST NOT be enrolled 
in this study. Any subject enrolled in the study who later is found to have not met the 
eligibility criteria at entry will be discontinued. 
3.2.2 Subject Completion 
If a subject has no ongoing Adverse Event (AE) at the conclusion of the 3-Month Follow-
Up Visit, the subject should be exited from the study (complete “Exit Visit” per Section 
5.1.3 ) and will be considered “Complete.” Subjects who require furt her follow-up at the 
conclusion of the 3-Month Follow-Up Visit will be followed according to the AE and/or 
Unscheduled Visit Section until the AE is resolved or stabilized.  Once the AE has resolved 
or stabilized, the subject should be exited from the study (complete “Exit Visit” per Section 
5.1.3 ) and will be considered “Complete.” A subject MAY be disconti nued (at the 
discretion of the Investigator, the Sponsor, and/or the IRB/EC) prior to the final study visit 
for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:  
• an AE occurring during the course of the study, which precludes continued treatment 
or follow-u
p 
• persistent Grade 3 or 4 slit lamp findings (must be reported to the Sponsor within  
24 hours) 
• pe
rsistent study related symptoms/complaints 
• unacceptable distance lens visual acuity (VA) 
• unacceptable lens centration 
• unacceptable lens movement 
• other reason related to failure to follow study procedures 
A subject 
MUST be discontinued prior to the final study visit for any of the following 
reasons: 
• voluntary withdrawal  
• death  
• Investigator decision that it is not in the best medical interest of the subject to continue 
participa t
ion in the investigation 
• ineligible at Screening/Dispensing - does not meet the eligibility criteria in the protocol 
• inability to maintain recommended wearing schedule 
• continued failure to follow subject instructions 
• misses more than one consecutive follow-up visit 
• lack of motivation 
• lost to follow-up (refer to Section 3.2.3) 
• instillation of non-medically indicated solution not specified in the protocol 
• if either eye is discontinued 
• becomes pregnant during the study 
• 3-Month Follow-up Visit is conducted prior to Day 91  
Prior to discontinuing a subject, every effort should be made to contact the subject, 
schedule a final study visit, obtain as much follow-up data as possible, and to retrieve all 
study materials. AEs will be followed as described in Section 6.0 .  
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 16 of 79 
  
 Subject discontinuations will be documented clearly on the source document and 
applicabl e
 eCRF. The Investigator should indicate the PRIMARY (one) reason that the 
subject was discontinued for each eye. Subjects that are discontinued from the study 
following randomization will not be replaced. 
Exit Visit assessments should be completed for discontinued subjects. 
3.2.3 Lost to Follow-up 
Subjects who do not return for scheduled follow-up visits, as defined by the visit window 
and cannot be contacted, are to be considered lost to follow-up. All attempts to contact the 
subject should be documented and kept with the subject’s source documentation, and the 
applicable eCRFs will be completed.  Just prior to database lock, the database will be 
reviewed for all lost to follow-up entries to confirm, once again, that contact with the 
subject was never made. 
3.3 Investigators 
The study will be conducted at approximately 20 investigative site(s) located in the US by 
Investigators who are determined by Bausch + Lomb to be suitably qualified by training 
and experience to conduct this study. The Principal Investigator will sign the Device 
Investigator Agreement form prior to the start of the study. This form contains a statement 
specifying that the investigator is not allowed to deviate from the study protocol, except 
under emergency circumstances where the deviation protects the rights, safety and well-
being of human subjects. 
On average, each Investigator will enroll approximately 14 subjects, 28 eyes. A minimum 
of 20% of randomized subjects will be of Japanese descent (i.e., both maternal and paternal 
grandparents born in Japan). Some sites will enroll a predetermined number of subjects of 
Japanese descent. In the event that selected sites do not meet full enrollment, the Sponsor 
may decide to increase enrollment as needed at other currently active sites and/or additional 
site(s) may be added to satisfy the enrollment requirements of the study.  
3.4 Study Duration 
Investigators will have approximately four weeks from the enrollment start date 
communicated by the Sponsor to conduct the Screening/Dispensing Visit for all subjects 
at the site.  
Subjects will be followed for approximately 3 months (unless discontinued or lost to 
follow-up) from the initial Screening/Dispensing Visit and must adhere to the following 
schedule: 
Schedule of Follow-up and Exit Visits   
Visit Target Ac c eptable Visit Range 
1-Week Follow-up Visit Day 8 Day 6 – 10  
1-Month Follow-up Visit Day 31 Day 27 – 35 
2-Month Follow-up Visit Day 61 Day 54 – 68 
3-Month Follow-up Visit Day 91 Day 91* – 101 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 17 of 79 
  
 Visit Target Acceptable Visit Range 
Exit Visit N/A Same day as the 3-Month Follow-Up Visit or same day 
of Unscheduled Visit for early discontinuation subjects. 
*CRITICAL NOTE: All subjects must be scheduled so that the 3-month Follow-Up 
Visit occur
s no sooner than Day 91.  
The visit range is based on the date the study lenses are initially dispensed 
(Screening
/Dispensing Visit). A visit scheduling table will be provided to each site to aid 
the Investigator in scheduling follow-up visits. 
3.5 Protocol Changes and Amendments 
Changes to the protocol will be approved by the Sponsor.  An amendment to the protocol 
will also require submission and approval from the IRB before implementation. The 
Sponsor (or designee) will distribute protocol amendments to the investigative sites.  The 
Investigator is responsible for the ensuring that staff involved at his/her site have completed 
training on the changes before implementing with subjects.  
4.0 STUDY MATERIALS 
Bausch + Lomb will provide all study materials (with the exception of any kits for ocular 
cultures) at no charge to the Investigator. Sites will be responsible for obtaining their own 
ocular culturing kits from a local lab and will be reimbursed for associated expenses. Sites 
will be provided with dispensing sets for both the Test and Control lenses. All other 
materials will be provided to the site prior to the start of the study. Refer to Product 
Replacement (Section 4.8) for ordering replacement test or control product in the case of 
loss or damage.  
Subjects will be provided with lens cases in which to dry stack their used lenses, as well as 
Bausch + Lomb Sensitive Eyes® Drops. All used and unused lenses will be returned to the 
Sponsor at  e
nd of the study.   
Subjects must use only study supplied lenses/solutions.  Use of other contact lenses or care 
products is not allowed.

be dispensed at the Screening/Dispensing Visit and at the 1-week Follow-up Visit in 
sufficient quantities to maintain a daily disposable wear modality for the duration of the 
study.  Subjects must wear their study lenses to all follow-up visits. After contact lens 
assessments are complete at Follow-up Visits, the unmasked designee from the study site 
will collect and store worn lenses for subsequent return to the Sponsor. 
4.3.1 Storage Requirements 
All Test and Control lenses provided by the Sponsor must be stored in a secure location 
accessible only to unmasked study personnel and maintained at room temperature above 
34°F (1°C). 
4.3.2 Subject Instructions 
a) All subjects must be given Subject Instructions for the use of study lenses (refer to 
Appendix C  for Subject Instructions). Subjects must comply with the ins t ructions 
provided to them. Subject Instructions will be supplied to the Investigator by Bausch + 
Lomb for distribution to the subject. 
b) The Investigator or other designee must review, with the subject, the Subject 
Instructions and the precautions and warnings, as appropriate for the study. 
c) Any subject who does not follow instructions to a degree that, in the Sponsor or 
Investigator's opinion, jeopardizes the subject's well-being or the validity of the study, 
should be discontinued. 
4.3.3 Fitting Guide 
The Investigator should refer to the Fitting Guide (see Appendix D ) for fitting the Test and 
Control lenses. 
4.4 Other Study Materials  
All subjects will be dispensed Bausch + Lomb Sensitive Eyes® Drops for use as needed 
and lens c
ases for return of worn study lenses to the Investigator during the study.  
Participants are not to use their own contact lens drops/solutions, but rather the 
drops/solutions provided to them. OTHER CONTACT LENS CARE PRODUCTS ARE 
NOT ALLOWED TO BE USED.  
Investigators will return worn and unworn study lenses to the Sponsor at the end of the 
study. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 19 of 79 
  
 4.5 Packaging and Labeling 
The Test le n
ses will be packaged in a blister pack with an investigational label. The label 
will contain the following information at minimum: 
• lens power 
• base curve 
• lot number 
• expiration date 
• manufacturer’s name 
• manufacturer’s place of business 
• caution statement 
Control len s
es will be packaged in standard commercial blister pack packaging. 
4.6 Accountability 
The unmasked designee at each site will be responsible for keeping current and accurate 
records of the amount of study lenses received and dispensed, and their disposition. The 
study lenses must be stored under the appropriate conditions in a secure area and are to be 
dispensed only to subjects enrolled in the study, in accordance with the conditions specified 
in this protocol. An accountability log will be provided to the sites for the unmasked 
designee to maintain records of the study lenses assigned to each enrolled subject. 
At time points throughout the study and/or upon completion of the study, the 
Sponsor/Sponsor's representative will review and verify the Investigator's accountability 
records.  Following verification, and as directed by the Sponsor, all study lenses (Test and 
Control, both worn and unworn) must be returned to the Sponsor at the address below: 
                                                                                                               
 
 
 
 
4.7 Mas
king/Unmasking  
The Investigator/site staff and Bausch + Lomb personnel or designee(s) involved in the 
conduct of the study will be masked to the study lenses. Each site must have an unmasked 
designee that will be responsible for dispensing and collecting the study Test and Control 
lenses and accountability.  This designee shall not participate in study assessments that 
may cause bias to the study data.  
The randomization schedule will be created by an unmasked statistician not otherwise 
involved in the study.  Personnel involved with repackaging and supply of clinical trial 
material will also be unmasked.  Field Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) will become 
unmasked during product reconciliation, at the conclusion of each site’s participation in 
the study and prior to locking the database.  Unmasked designees at the site will manage 
the dispensation and return of study lenses and related supplies. All other study personnel 
will remain masked until database lock.  

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 20 of 79 
  
 In the event that unmasking of a subject’s randomly assigned treatment is required, the 
Investigat o
r (or other designee) is required to contact the Medical Monitor (or designee) to 
request permission to unmask.  The Medical Monitor (or designee) will contact the Sponsor 
designee (Dan Donatello, see Personnel and Facilities Page 3) and obtain approval to grant 
permission to unmask.  Upon receipt of authorization from the Sponsor designee, the 
Medical Monitor (or designee) will advise the Investigator (or other qualified designee) to 
log into the randomization system and unmask the subject.  If the Medical Monitor cannot 
be contacted, the Investigator (or other qualified designee) should then contact the Sponsor 
designee who can authorize the unmasking of a subject.  In the event that the Medical 
Monitor or Sponsor designee cannot be contacted and the Investigator (or other qualified 
designee) deems the unmasking emergent, the Investigator may log into the randomization 
system without authorization and unmask the subject. Whether unmasking occurs 
inadvertently or intentionally, the Investigator must notify the Medical Monitor or Sponsor 
designee as soon as possible after unmasking. In addition, the Investigator must record the 
date, time, and reason for unmasking the study treatment in the source documentation. 
Subjects will be instructed to insert the study lenses out of the sight of the Investigator or 
site staff other than the unmasked designee. Subjects are not to show the study blister packs 
and foils to the Investigator or site staff other than the unmasked designee unless instructed 
to do so. 
4.8 Product Replacement 
Subjects will be given an adequate supply of study lenses to wear on a daily disposable 
basis for the duration of the study.  
All additional/replacement lenses (either Test or Control) must be ordered from Bausch + 
Lomb Clinical Trial Materials Supply Chain by sending a Material Order Form to 
. 
4.9 Risk Assessment 
Info
rmation concerning potential risks associated with the investigational device (as well 
as possible interactions with concomitant medical treatments and risk-to-benefit ratio) can 
be found within the Report of Prior Investigations (ROPI) for the study.  Risks are also 
summarized within the Informed Consent document.  The assessments required for the 
study are routinely performed and are standard of care for contact lens wearers. The 
subjects will be informed of any potential study specific risks in the ICF or if new risks 
become apparent during the study. 
5.0 STUDY METHODS 
5.1 Study Visits  
Refer to Appendix A  for a schedule of visits and parameters and Appendix B  for Methods 
of Clinical Evaluation.  
Following identification of a potential subject, the Investigator (or designee) will explain 
the purpose of the study, procedures, risks/benefits, and subject responsibilities to the 
potential subject. The subject’s willingness and ability to meet the follow-up requirements 
of the study will be determined. If the subject chooses to participate in the investigation, 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 21 of 79 
  
 written informed consent will be obtained. The subject and the person obtaining written 
consent w i
ll sign and date the IRB-approved ICF. The Investigator must keep the signed 
ICF document. The signed original document should be retained in the subject’s records, 
and a copy should be provided to the subject.  In addition, the applicable privacy regulation 
requirements must be met. 
5.1.1 Screening/Dispensing Visit (Day 1) 
A Screening Log will be provided by the Sponsor to track all consented subjects that the 
Investigator interviews regarding the study. Once all available lines on the Screening Log 
have been completed, or the Investigator has fulfilled his/her quota of subjects, the 
Investigator will sign and date the form to verify that all the subjects who interviewed for 
the study have provided informed consent and Health Insurance Portability Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) authorization. 
After obtaining written informed consent, prospective subjects will be screened to 
determine whether they meet the entry criteria for the study.  
Screening/Dispensing will proceed as follows: 
a. Enter the subject information on the next available line of the Screening Log. 
b. Collect the subject’s demographics including collection of the Family Tree Worksheet 
for subjects of Japanese descent. 
c. Collect the following lens use history information from the subject: 
− Average number of days per week worn 
− Average daily wearing time, hours per day 
− Average hours of comfortable wear per day 
− Hours lenses worn on the day of this visit 
− Current lens brand and lens wear modality 
− Current lens care products 
d. Collect ocular medical history (within 1 year of signing the ICF) and concomitant 
medications. Concomitant medications (as defined for this study) include any 
medications for ocular conditions taken within 30 days of signing the ICF and any 
concomitant medications taken during the study.  
e. Perform high-contrast distance VA with the subject’s habitual lenses. 
f. Perform the following assessments (without lenses): 
− spherocylindrical refraction using a phoropter 
− distance high-contrast best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) using a 
phoropter 
− keratometry 
g. Perform a slit lamp examination (without lenses) and record: 
− Any ungraded finding marked as “Present” 
− Any corneal scars 
− Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 22 of 79 
  
 − Any corneal staining 
− Any corn e
al infiltrate (record details on the Corneal Infiltrates Evaluation Form in 
Section 8.0 of Appendix B ) 
− Record and sketch any scars and slit lamp findings greater than Grade 2 in the 
subject’s source document. 
− After fluorescein is used, flush the eyes with sterile saline solution.  Wait at least 
5 minutes before inserting new lenses. 
h. Indicate on the Screening Log whether the subject is a “Screen Pass” or “Screen Fail”.  
“Screen Fail” subjects are ineligible and cannot be randomized in the study.  The reason 
for screen failure must be documented on the Screening Log and in the subject’s source.  
The subject’s source is to be maintained with their ICF. 
Only “Screen Pass” subjects should be randomized in the study.  If the subject is a “Screen 
Pass”, perform the following: 
i. Collect Symptoms/Complaints Rating Scales (refer to Section 6.0 of Appendix B ) from 
the subject regarding their habitual lenses. 
j. Randomize the subject using Oracle Randomization System (ORS).  The unmasked 
designee ONLY must determine the subject’s randomized study lens assignment 
through ORS.  
The unmasked designee will then dispense lenses (in the subject’s randomized study 
lens assignment and appropriate sphere powere) to maintain a daily disposable 
modality until the 1-Week Follow-up Visit and record the dispensation in the Product 
Accountability Log.  
In an effort to ensure the Investigator remains masked, the unmasked designee MUST 
dispense the lens blister packs. 
k. Have the subject insert one pair of the study lenses in their eyes. In an effort to ensure 
the Investigator remains masked, the subject MUST insert the lenses out of the sight of 
the Investigator and other masked site personnel. 
l. Review Subject Instructions with the subject and provide the subject with a copy of the 
instructions.  Dispense lens cases.  Instruct the subject to place all worn lenses in a lens 
case (up to 10 pairs of lenses per case) with no solution (dry). The subject should return 
the lens cases to the site at the 1-Week Follow-Up Visit.  Remind the subject to use the 
white drawstring bag to bring all lenses (worn and unworn) to each visit. 
NOTE: Study lenses should be allowed to equilibrate a minimum of three minutes on the eye.  
m. Record the dispensed lens sphere power and after a minimum of three minutes of the 
subject w e
aring the lenses, perform the following assessments: 
− distance high-contrast lens VA 
− over-refraction and distance high-contrast VA (using a phoropter) 
− lens wettability  
− lens centration  
− lens movement  
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 23 of 79 
  
 For each eye, compare the distance high-contrast lens VA to the distance high-contrast 
BSCVA obt a
ined at this visit. If the VA has decreased by 5 letters (0.1 logMAR) or 
more, explain. 
n. Collect abbreviated Symptoms/Complaints Rating Scales regarding the study lenses: 
• Rating Scale #1: Burning/Stinging Upon Insertion,  
• Rating Scale #2: Comfort Upon Insertion,  
• Rating Scale #11: Vision Upon Insertion. 
o. Collect/assess all AEs/ADEs, including serious or significant non-serious AEs, that 
have occurred since consent was signed. 
p. For female subjects of childbearing potential, re-emphasize the exclusion criterion 
stating that if the subject is pregnant and/or breast feeding, she is ineligible to be a part 
of the study. 
q. The following eCRF should be completed only if the subject is a “Screen Pass”: 
− Screening/Dispensing Visit 
Note: If the subject is discontinued or exited at this visit (after randomization), complete 
the “Exit Visit” (per 5.1.3). 
5.1.2 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month, and 3-Month Follow-up Visits 
NOTE:  If the subject does not come to a visit wearing lenses and is not experiencing any 
problems, i t
 is preferred if the current visit is rescheduled within the visit window. 
a. If this is an Exit Visit, complete the “Exit Visit” assessments (per Section 5 .1.3). If a 
subject misses the scheduled follow-up visit and cannot be seen prior to the start of the 
visit range for the next scheduled follow-up visit, then the visit is considered missed.   
b. Obtain information on any changes in ocular medical history and/or the use of 
concomitant medications. 
c. Collect the following lens information from the subject: 
− Average number of days per week worn 
− Average daily wearing time, hours per day  
− Average hours of comfortable wear per day  
− Hours lenses worn on the day of this visit  
d. Collect Symptoms/Complaints information (refer to Section 6.0 of Appendix B ) from 
the subject regarding their study lenses and perform the Lens Performance Rating 
Scales (refer to Section 5.0 of Appendix B ). 
e. Evaluate the study lenses (while on eye) and record the following assessments: 
− distance high-contrast lens VA 
− over-refraction and distance high-contrast VA (using a phoropter) 
− lens wettability 
− lens deposits 
− lens centration

For each eye, compare  
- The distance high-contrast lens VA to the distance high-contrast lens VA obtained 
at the Screening/Dispensing Visit.  
- The distance high-contrast lens VA to the distance high-contrast BSCVA obtained 
at the Screening/Dispensing Visit.  
- If the VA has decreased by ≥  10 letters (0.2 logMAR) or more, explain. 
f. Perform a  s
lit lamp examination (without lenses) and record the following: 
− Any ungraded finding marked as “Present” 
− Any new corneal scars 
− Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea 
− Any corneal staining 
− Any corneal infiltrate (record details on the Corneal Infiltrates Evaluation Form  in 
Appendix B)  
− Record and sketch any scars and slit lamp findings greater than Grade 2 in the 
subject’s source document. 
− After fluorescein is used, flush the eyes with sterile saline solution.  Ensure that at 
least 5 minutes pass if the subject inserts a new pair of lenses at this visit. 
g. At the 1-Week follow-up visit, the unmasked designee will dispense additional lenses, 
ensuring that the subject has sufficient lenses to maintain a daily disposable wear 
modality until the 3-Month Follow-up Visit according to the randomization assignment 
for each subject and record in the Product Accountability Log. Remind the subject to 
use the white drawstring bag to bring all lenses (worn and unworn) to each visit.  In an 
effort to ensure the Investigator remains masked, the unmasked designee MUST 
dispense the lens blister packs. If the subject inserts lenses at the visit, the subject 
MUST insert the lenses out of the sight of the Investigator and other masked site 
personnel. 
h. Record the following in the source documentation and transcribe to the appropriate 
Follow-Up Visit Form: 
- dispensed lens sphere power 
i. If a lens parameter change is required, the subject MUST insert one pair of the newly 
dispensed lenses in their eyes. After the lenses have equilibrated for at least 3 minutes, 
confirm the lenses are acceptable for study continuation. If the lenses are unacceptable 
for study continuation, complete the “Exit Visit” (per Section 5.1.3 ) and discontinue 
the subject from the study. 
j. At all Follow-up Visits, collect the worn lenses from the Subject for return to the 
Sponsor. Dispense additional lens cases. Instruct the subject to place all worn lenses in 
a lens case (10 pairs of lenses per case) with no solution (dry). The subject should return

Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 25 of 79 
  
 the lens cases to the site at the 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month, and 3-Month Follow-Up 
Visits. 
k. C
ollect/assess all AEs/ADEs, including serious or significant non-serious AEs, since 
consent was signed. 
l. For female subjects of child-bearing potential, re-emphasize the exclusion criterion 
stating that if the subject is pregnant and/or breast feeding, she is ineligible to be a part 
of the study. 
m. The following eCRF should be completed: 
− appropriate Follow-up Visit (1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month, or 3-Month) 
Note: If the subject is discontinued or exited at this visit, complete the “Exit Visit” (per 
5.1.3). 
 
CRITICAL NOTE: All subjects must be scheduled so that the 3-month Follow Up Visit 
occurs no sooner than Day 91. 
5.1.3 Exit Visit (On the same day immediately following the 3-Month Follow-Up Visit 
or Unscheduled Visit for any subject(s) being discontinued from the study) 
Do not continue with the Exit Visit until/unless the subject is ready to exit the 
study.  Subjects who require further follow-up at the conclusion of the 3-Month 
Follow-Up Visit will be followed according to the AE and/or Unscheduled Visit 
Section until the AE is resolved or stabilized. 
a. Indicate status of the subject on the Subject Exit Form. If the status is “Discontinued” 
or “Non-dispensed,” indicate the PRIMARY exit reason for each eye on the Subject 
Exit Form. 
b. Obtain information on any changes in ocular medical history and/or the use of 
concomitant medications.  
c. For all subjects, complete an exit ocular examination without lenses on the eyes. Collect 
the following assessments: 
− spherocylindrical refraction using a phoropter 
− distance high-contrast BSCVA using a phoropter 
− keratometry

high-contrast BSCVA obtained at the Screening/Dispensing Visit. If the VA has 
decreased by 10 letters (0.2 logMAR) or more, explain. 
e. For each eye, compare the Exit Visit keratometry readings to the Screening/Dispensing 
Visit keratometry readings. If there is a change of 1.00 D or more, explain. 
f. Collect all worn and unworn study lenses. 
g. Collect/assess all AEs and ADEs, including serious or significant non-serious AEs, that 
have occurred since consent was signed. 
h. The following eCRF should be completed:   
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 26 of 79 
  
 − Subject Exit  
5.1.4 Unsche d
uled Visits 
Additional visits may be scheduled, as necessary, to ensure the safety and well-being of 
subjects. All additional exams should be fully documented in the source documents and on 
Unscheduled Visit eCRFs, as appropriate. Visits intended to fulfill scheduled visit 
requirements that fall outside the designated scheduled visit range are not Unscheduled 
Visits. In these cases, the visit data will be collected and transcribed to the appropriate 
scheduled visit eCRF. 
If a subject is seen for multiple visits during a given visit timeframe, the data from the visit 
that is intended to meet the protocol requirements for the scheduled visit should be captured 
on the visit eCRF. Where such a determination cannot be made, the first visit within the 
scheduled visit interval will be used for completion of the protocol required scheduled visit 
eCRF. Data from any additional visits within a scheduled visit interval will be captured on 
an Unscheduled Visit eCRF.  
Subjects who require further follow-up on an AE/SAE upon discontinuation or at the 
conclusion of the 3-Month Follow-Up Visit will be followed according to the AE and/or 
Unscheduled Visit Section as necessary. At these follow-up visits, the subject should 
remove contact lenses s/he may be wearing. At a minimum, a slit lamp examination, 
keratometry, spherocylindrical refraction, and distance high-contrast BSCVA should be 
completed. The Investigator is required to follow the subject until the condition no longer 
warrants further follow-up for study purposes. 
Product Dispensing Only (Part of the Unscheduled Visit - used only if lens replacement is 
needed) 
If a subject is only seen for an unscheduled lens replacement, a complete exam is not 
required as long as the subject is not experiencing any problems. In these cases, the 
following information will be collected in the source documents and transcribed to the 
Product Dispensing Only eCRF: 
• Visit date 
• Subject Identification (ID) number 
• Subject initials 
• Primary reason for replacement 
NOTE: For study lens replacement, an unmasked designee MUST dispense the study lens 
blister packs to the subject to ensure the Investigator remains masked.  The unmasked 
designee will also record the lenses dispensed on the Product Accountability Log. If the 
subject inserts lenses at the visit, the subject MUST insert the lenses out of the sight of the 
Investigator and other masked site staff. 
If a subject is experiencing problems, complete the following, as appropriate, and complete 
an Unscheduled Visit eCRF instead of a Product Dispensing Only eCRF: 
a. Indicate the reason for the Unscheduled Visit. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 27 of 79 
  
 b. Obtain information on any changes in ocular medical history and/or the use of 
concomit a
nt medications. 
c. Collect the following lens information from the subject regarding the study lenses: 
− Average number of days per week worn 
− Average daily wearing time, hours per day  
− Average hours of comfortable wear per day  
− Hours lenses worn on the day of this visit  
d. Collect Symptoms/Complaints information (refer to Section 6.0 of Appendix B ) from 
the subject regarding their study lenses and perform the Lens Performance Rating 
Scales (refer to Section 5.0 of Appendix B ).  
e. If the subject did not come to the visit wearing one or more study lenses, go to step f. 
Otherwise, evaluate the lenses (while on eye), and record the following assessments: 
− distance high-contrast lens VA 
− over-refraction and distance high-contrast VA (using a phoropter) 
− lens wettability 
− lens deposits 
− lens centration 
− lens discoloration  
− lens movement  
For each eye, compare the distance high-contrast lens VA to the distance high-contrast 
lens VA obtained at the Screening/Dispensing Visit. If the VA has decreased by 10 
letters (0.2 logMAR) or more, explain. 
For each eye, compare the distance high-contrast lens VA to the distance high-contrast 
BSCVA obtained at the Screening/Dispensing Visit. If the VA has decreased by  
10 letters (0.2 logMAR) or more, explain. 
f. Perform a slit lamp examination (without lenses) and record the results and findings.  
Record and sketch any scars and slit lamp findings greater than Grade 2 in the subject’s 
source document. After fluorescein is used, flush the eyes with sterile saline solution.  
Ensure that at least 5 minutes pass if the subject inserts a new pair of lenses at this visit. 
g. If an unscheduled lens replenishment is required, the unmasked designee will dispense 
additional lenses ensuring that the subject has sufficient lenses to maintain a daily 
disposable wear modality until the Follow-Up Visit according to the Randomization 
assignment for each subject and record in the Product Accountability Log. In an effort 
to ensure the Investigator remains masked, an unmasked designee MUST dispense the 
lens blister packs to the subject. If the subject inserts lenses at the visit, the subject 
MUST insert the lenses out of the sight of the Investigator and any other masked site 
staff. 
h. Record the following in the source documentation and transcribe to the appropriate 
eCRF form for the Unscheduled Visit: 
− dispensed lens sphere power 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 28 of 79 
  
 i. If a lens parameter change is required, the subject MUST insert one pair of the 
dispense d
 lenses in their eyes. After the lenses have equilibrated for at least 3 minutes, 
confirm the lenses are acceptable for study continuation. If the lenses are unacceptable 
for study continuation, complete the “Exit Visit” (per Section 5.1.3 ) and discontinue 
the subject from the study. 
j. Collect the worn lenses from the Subject (if brought by the subject to the Unscheduled 
Visit). Dispense additional lens cases, if needed. Instruct the subject to place all worn 
lenses in a lens case (10 pairs of lenses per case) with no solution (dry). The subject 
should return the lens cases to the site at the next Follow-Up Visit. 
k. Collect/assess all AEs/ADEs, including serious or significant non-serious AEs, that 
have occurred since consent was signed. 
l. For female subjects of childbearing potential, re-emphasize the exclusion criterion 
stating that if the subject is pregnant and/or breast feeding, she is ineligible to be a part 
of the study. 
m. The following eCRFs should be completed:  
− Unscheduled visit  
Note: If the subject is discontinued or exited at this visit, complete the “Exit Visit” (per 
5.1.3). 
5.1.5 Missed Visits  
If a subject misses any scheduled follow-up visit and cannot be seen prior to the start of 
the visit range for the next scheduled follow-up visit, the visit is considered missed.  
5.2 Study Completion  
Bausch + Lomb will notify the Investigator when to contact the IRB to inform them that 
the study is complete. 
5.2.1 Study Termination/Suspension 
If, during the study, it becomes evident to the Sponsor that the study should be stopped 
prematurely or placed on hold, appropriate notification will be given to the Investigator(s) 
and IRBs, and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Local Health 
Authority, as applicable. Bausch + Lomb will instruct the Investigators to stop/restart 
dispensing study materials and will arrange for study closeout, if applicable, at each site.  
Any subjects with ongoing Adverse Events at the time of premature study termination or 
hold will be followed by the Investigator, as outlined in the Safety Management Plan. 
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Therapy 
Other contact lenses/solutions are not allowed to be used by subjects during the study.  
Ocular medications or systemic or topical medications that, in the Investigator’s opinion, 
could potentially affect ocular physiology or lens performance are also prohibited, unless 
medically necessary during the course of the study. Ocular medications that have been 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 29 of 79 
  
 taken in the past 30 days before signing the ICF and any medications taken during the 
course of t h
e study will be collected in the source and appropriate eCRF.  
5.4 Protocol Deviations 
The date of and reason for deviations will be documented in all cases. Significant or major 
protocol deviations impacting the safety of the subject or the integrity of the study must be 
reported by the Investigator to the IRB immediately. Reporting of all other protocol 
deviations must adhere to the requirements of the governing IRB.  
Any subject enrolled in the study who later is found to have not met the eligibility criteria 
at entry will be discontinued.  Otherwise, unless the protocol deviations put the subject at 
risk or the subject’s condition requires that they be discontinued from the study, subjects 
may continue to participate until the end of the study. 
According to the the Device Investigator Agreement, all investigators participating in this 
study agree to conduct the study in accordance with the relevant, current protocol and agree 
to only make changes in a protocol after being notified by the Sponsor, except when 
necessary to protect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects.    
Site Corrective Action plans will be developed and completed as deemed necessary by the 
CRO for sites or investigators who deviate from this protocol in a way that adversely affects 
the rights, safety or well-being of the subject(s) and/or the quality or integrity of data.  The 
Site Corrective Action Plan will outline the deviation and the site’s corrective and/or 
remedial actions.  Decisions regarding critical deviations that merit investigator 
disqualification and site closure will be made by the Sponsor and documented in the Trial 
Master File.    
6.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
6.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
For the purposes of this study, reportable AEs include ocular AEs and non-ocular serious 
adverse events (SAEs). All AEs will be classified first for seriousness and significance and 
then as to whether or not they are device related or non-device related and if device related, 
then, if it is an adverse device effect (ADE), an anticipated serious adverse device effect 
(ASADEs) or an unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADEs). AEs, ADEs, 
ASADEs, USADEs, SAEs, Significant Non-Serious AEs and Non-Significant Non-
Serious AEs are defined as follows: 
6.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in a subject, user, or other persons, whether or 
not related to the investigational medical device. This definition includes events not related 
to the investigational medical device, comparator, or the procedures involved. For users or 
other persons, this definition is restricted to events not related to investigational medical 
devices. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 30 of 79 
  
 Throughout the course of this study all efforts will be made to remain alert to reportable 
AEs. If an A
E occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate 
medical intervention will be made. 
All reportable AEs occurring after signing of informed consent and through the subject’s 
end of participation in the study must be reported. All reportable AEs must be followed 
until the event resolves or stabilizes. 
Applicable AEs (from slit lamp examination) should be photo documented and 
communicated to the Medical Monitor. 
6.1.2 Adverse Device Effect (ADE) 
An ADE is an AE that is assessed to be related to the use of an investigational medical 
device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions 
for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of the 
investigational medical device. This definition also includes any event resulting from use 
error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. 
6.1.2.1  Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (ASADE) 
An ASADE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see Section 6.1.3 ) or significant 
non-serious criteria (see Section 6.1.4 ) and which, by its nature, incidence, severity or 
outcome, has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application) and/or in the risk analysis report. ASADEs 
include:   
• Corneal Ulcer (infectious or non-infectious) 
• Keratitis
 
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia) 
• Excessive eye secretions including mucopurulent discharge 
• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects 
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision) 
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by removing the lens 
6.1.2.2  Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (USADE) 
An USADE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see Section 6.1.3 ) and has an 
effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
6.1.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An AE that: 
o Led to death; 
o Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in: 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 31 of 79 
  
 ‒ A life-threatening illness or injury; or 
‒ A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function (e.g., 
blindness)
; or 
‒ Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization; or 
‒ Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or pe
rmanent impairment to a body structure or a body function; 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
Note: A planned hospitalization for a pre-existing condition, or a procedure 
required by the protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered 
an SAE. 
Serious adverse events are also those events that result in, or have potential to cause, either 
permanent impairment of an ocular function or damage to an ocular structure and may 
necessitate medical or surgical intervention. 
Serious adverse events may include any hazardous, sight-threatening conditions occurring 
after exposure to the test article, including the following: 
• A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal 
tissue). For the purposes of reporting, this includes: 
o Central or para-central location;  
o Penetration of Bowman’s membrane; 
o Infiltrate ≥ 2 mm diameter; 
o Associated  w
ith iritis;  
o Associated with any increase in intraocular pressure; 
o Culture positive for microorganisms; 
o Increasing size or severity at subsequent visits; 
NOTE: Signs of a presumed infectious corneal ulcer may include irregular focal 
infiltrates, active lesions with raised edges, significant diffuse infiltration, anterior 
corneal to mid-stromal involvement, erosion with overlying staining, conjunctival 
and lid edema, anterior chamber reaction (iritis), and severe bulbar and limbal 
redness. Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial 
keratitis) may include pain of rapid onset, severe redness, purulent or 
mucopurulent discharge, tearing, and photophobia.  
• Any central or paracentral (within 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that results in 
permanen t
 opacification (such as corneal scar or vascularization); 
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and/or hyphema; 
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea;  
• Permanent loss of ≥ 2 lines/10 letters of BSCVA; 
• Loss of ≥  15 le
tters of Distance High-Contrast lens VA from baseline 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 32 of 79 
  
 • All cases of iritis. 
6.1.4 Signif i
cant Non-Serious Adverse Events 
A significant non-serious adverse event is an AE that does not meet the serious criteria, is 
considered significant by the Sponsor, and requires expedited reporting. These events 
include:  
• Peripheral non-progressive non-infectious corneal ulcers;  
• All symptomatic corneal infiltrative events;  
• All cases of corneal staining greater than or equal to Grade 3; 
• A temporary loss of two or more lines/10 or more letters of BSCVA (for greater 
than or equal to 2 weeks); 
• Neovascularization cases Grade 2 or greater; 
• Any ocular event that necessitates temporary lens discontinuation of greater than 
or equal to 2 weeks. 
6.1.5 Non-Significant Non-Serious Adverse Events 
A non-significant non-serious adverse event may include but are not limited to the 
following and does not require expedited reporting: 
• Bacterial Conjunctivitis; 
• Viral Conjunctivitis; 
• Allergic Conjunctivitis; 
• Corneal Edema; 
• Contact Lens Related Papillary Conjunctivitis; and, 
• Loss of Contrast Sensitivity 
6.2 Adverse Event Treatment and Culturing 
With any AE, treat the subject as appropriate to prevent further complications and to 
potentially resolve the event consistent with the standard of care. 
For purposes of this study, the Sponsor requests that cultures should be obtained in cases 
of corneal ulcer or suspected ocular infection, unless medically contraindicated. Cultures 
should be taken from the cul-de-sac, lower eyelid margin, and the corneal lesion (if 
applicable). The required culturing techniques are outlined in Appendix B . 
When a culture is obtained, the contact lenses and contact lens cases which were being 
utilized by the subject at the time of the AE should be collected from the subject for 
culturing and processing by the local clinical laboratory designated by the site. 
Microbial data generated from returned subject supplies (e.g., lenses, lens cases) are for 
information only. Because microbes may be introduced into subject supplies during use, 
recovery of microbes from returned subject supplies cannot be presumed to indicate 
etiology or direction of organism transmission. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 33 of 79 
  
 The ocular cultures, along with the associated contact lenses and contact lens cases, will 
be sent t o
 the local clinical laboratory designated by the site for analysis. The clinical 
laboratory will report the culture results to the Investigator who will record the results in 
the eCRF. 
6.3 Evaluations 
When evaluating for reportable AEs, the Investigator must first determine if the event is 
serious (refer to Section 6.1.3  for criteria) and/or significant (refer to Sections 6.1.4  and 
6.1.5 ) and then assess the severity of symptoms and the relationshi p of the event to the 
study device using the following guidelines: 
6.3.1 Severity 
• Mild:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, 
requires no treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities. 
• Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low 
level of concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities but can 
be relieved by simple therapeutic care. 
• Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and 
requires systemic therapy or other treatment 
6.3.2 Relationship to Study Device and/or Rewetting Drops 
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to 
the study device (contact lens) and/or rewetting drops. Reasonable 
possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or 
association between the study device and/or rewetting drops and the AE. 
Also referred to as an ADE. 
• Not Related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE is 
related to the study device (contact lens) and/or rewetting drops. This 
assessment implies that the AE has no evidence to suggest either a causal 
relationship or association to the study device and/or Rewetting Drops and a 
more likely or certain alternative etiology exists. 
6.4 Procedures for Reporting SAEs and Significant Non-Serious Adverse Events 
An AE classified as a SAE or a Significant Non-Serious AE requires expeditious handling 
and reporting to the Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements, as follows: 
• The event must be reported to the Medical Monitor (or designee) within 24 
hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the event via facsimile/email 
transmission on a paper SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report Form 
signed by the Investigator. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 34 of 79 
  
 Lexitas Medical Monitor (or designee) 
 
 
 
 
 
• The Me d
ical Monitor (or designee) will email a copy of the form (within 24 
hours) to  
 
.  
• Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully 
docu
ment the event before initially notifying the Medical Monitor (or 
designee) of an SAE or a Significant Non-Serious AE. Additional relevant 
information such as hospital records and autopsy reports should be provided 
to the Medical Monitor (or designee) as soon as they are available. 
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of 
the subjects: notably, he/she should follow a subject with an SAE or 
Significant Non-Serious AE until the event has resolved or the condition has 
stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has 
left the study, and that additional evaluations may be requested by the 
Sponsor. 
• Ensure that the subject's identity is protected and the subject's identifiers in the 
clinical trial are properly mentioned on the form. 
• BEGIN TREATMENT OF THE AE IMMEDIATELY BY A SUITABLY 
LICENSED EYE CARE PROFESSIONAL. 
• Continue to update the paper SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report 
Form, if applicable, each time the subject is seen during the management of 
the event and at resolution of the event.  All updated report forms should be 
submitted to the Medical Monitor (or designee) who will distribute the reports 
as stated above. Whenever possible, it is suggested that the Investigator take 
photographs of all applicable AEs and forward them to the Medical Monitor 
(or designee). 
• Events requiring medical treatment will be evaluated by the Sponsor. Upon 
review of the medical treatment, Bausch + Lomb representatives may contact 
the Investigator to request further information concerning the treatment. 
• Report all USADEs to the reviewing IRB within 10 working days following 
awareness of the USADE or according to the established reporting procedures 
of the IRB, whichever is shorter. 
• Submit all bills, prescription receipts, and culture reports/fees related to the 
AE to the Bausch + Lomb.  Expense incurred for study related medical 
treatment will be paid by Bausch + Lomb. 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 35 of 79 
  
 • Full details of the process for reporting adverse events are outlined in the 
Safety Mana
gement Plan. 
6.4.1 Off-site Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect Reporting 
When participating in multicenter clinical investigations, Investigators may receive off-site 
USADE reports. These are Sponsor reports of USADEs which occurred at other clinical 
sites for the same trial, or in different trials using the same test or control lenses, that met 
the criteria for reporting to a regulatory agency. These should be reported to the reviewing 
IRB within 10 working days or per their established reporting procedures, whichever is 
shorter. 
6.4.2 Reporting Device Deficiencies 
A device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies include 
malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
Investigators must evaluate, record, and report via applicable  forms any complaints/ 
deficiencies or malfunctions experienced with the study solution during this trial to the 
Medical Monitor (or designee) promptly. The Sponsor and Medical Monitor shall review 
all device deficiencies and, upon the Sponsor’s request, Investigators must supply any 
additional information related to the safety reporting of a particular event. 
Report device deficiencies within 24 hours of knowledge to: 
Lexitas Medical Monitor (or designee) 
 
 
 
  
The Medical Monitor (or designee) will distribute, within 24 hours of knowledge, all 
devic
e deficiencies to the Sponsor including:  
. 
The Sponsor shall review all device deficiencies and determine and document in writing 
wheth
er they could have led to an SAE. In the event of a disagreement between the Sponsor 
and the Investigator(s), the Sponsor shall communicate both opinions to the reviewing IRB 
per their established reporting procedures and the health authority. 
6.4.3 Guidelines for Reporting Pregnancies  
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth control 
during the study, to include 2 weeks after last visit, in a manner such that risk of 
contraceptive failure is minimized. Abstinence is allowed as a birth control method.   
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to 
contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed 
or late menstrual period). Female subjects who become pregnant during the study will be 
discontinued from the study and followed until completion of pregnancy. Every effort will 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 36 of 79 
  
 be made to obtain the health status of the mother and infant at term or fetus (in cases of 
miscarriag e
 or therapeutic abortion). Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be reported on a paper Pregnancy Report Form and 
submitted to the Medical Monitor (or designee) via facsimile or email transmission within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy.  The Medical Monitor (or 
designee) will distribute the completed form to the Sponsor as per the distribution list in 
Section 6.4 . 
All pregnancies will be followed until outcome even after study closure.  The outcome of 
all pregnancies will be reported on a paper Pregnancy Outcome Report Form and submitted 
to the Medical Monitor (or designee) via facsimile or email transmission once the outcome 
is learned. The Medical Monitor (or designee) will distribute the completed form to the 
Sponsor as per the distribution list in Section 6.4 .  
Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an AE or SAE, 
any pregnancy complication, spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy, 
for medical reasons, will be recorded as an SAE. Any serious complication or event 
resulting from the pregnancy should be reported to the Medical Monitor (or designee) 
within 24 hours on the SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report Form along with the 
Pregnancy Report Form. 
The contact for reporting pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes is: 
Lexitas Medical Monitor (or designee) 
 
 
 
  
 
7.0 STA T
ISTICAL METHODS 
7.1 Study Endpoints 
The primary safety and effectiveness endpoints will be evaluated at the eye level. 
7.1.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoints 
The primary effectiveness endpoint will be contact lens corrected distance high-contrast 
VA averaged over all scheduled visits. 
7.1.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints 
This study has no secondary effectiveness endpoints. 
7.1.3 Safety Endpoints 
The primary safety endpoint will be any slit lamp finding greater than Grade 2 over the 
course of the study. 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 37 of 79 
  
 7.2 Hypotheses 
For each  
primary hypothesis, the statistical objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of 
the Test lens compared to the Control lens. 
7.2.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
The null hypothesis ( ) is that the difference in mean logMAR VA between the test group 
and the co
ntrol group ( −) is 0.06 or greater. The alternative hypothesis ( ) is that 
the differe
nce is less than 0.06. 
:−≥0.06  
:−<0.06  
7.2.2 Primary S a
fety Endpoint 
The null hypothesis ( ) is that the difference in the proportion of eyes with any slit lamp 
finding gr
eater than Grade 2 between the test group and the control group ( −) is 0.05 
or more. The a
lternative hypothesis ( ) is that the difference is less than 0.05. 
:−≥0.05  
:−<0.05  
7.3 Sample Size
 
Power and sample size calculations were performed using nQuery software version 7.0 
(Statistical Solutions Ltd). 
The unit of analysis for the primary endpoints will be the eye. 
7.3.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
In a previous study of a similar lens (Bausch + Lomb Protocol 6612), the standard deviation 
of the logM A
R VA averaged over all study visits was 0.076.  
When the sample size in each group is 222 eyes, a two group one-sided 0.05 significance 
level t-test will have 99% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test lens is not non-
inferior (the difference in means, −, is 0.06 or greater) in favor of the alternative 
hypothesis
 that the test lens is non-inferior, assuming that the expected difference in means 
is 0 and the common standard deviation is 0.076. 
7.3.2 Primary Safety Endpoint 
Over two previous studies of similar lenses (Bausch + Lomb Protocols 6612 and 6903), 
0.6% of eye
s had a slit lamp finding greater than Grade 2. An estimated proportion of 1% 
will be used to compute the sample size.  
With 222 eyes in each group, the upper limit of the observed one-sided 95% confidence 
interval will be expected to be less than 0.05 with 99% power when the Control proportion, 
, is 0.01 and the Test expected proportion, , is 0.01. These results are based on 
100,000 sim
ulations using the Newcombe-Wilson score method to construct the 
confidence interval. (Newcombe RG (1988) Interval estimation for the difference between 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 38 of 79 
  
 independent proportions: comparison of eleven methods. Statistics in Medicine 17:873-
890.) 
7.3.3 Over
all Power and Enrollment Targets 
7.3.3.1  Enrollment Target 
Every effort will be made to minimize losses to follow-up. Nevertheless, enrollment targets 
will be increased to allow completion of the expected sample sizes with losses of up to 
10%. 
The expected number of completed eyes is approximately 222 per treatment group. This 
corresponds to 111 subjects per treatment group. With two treatment arms, the target for 
completed subjects will be approximately 222 subjects. To allow for losses of up to 10%, 
approximately 222÷(1−0.1 )= 247 subjects will be enrolled. A minimum 20% of the 
enrolled sub
jects will be of Japanese descent. 
7.3.3.2  Overall Power 
If the primary endpoints are not correlated with each other, then the power will be 
approximately 99% x 99% = 98%.  
7.4 Randomization 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment groups in a one-to-one ratio. 
Randomization will be stratified by cohort (Japanese, Non-Japanese) and by site. 
7.5 Study Populations 
7.5.1 Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population 
The ITT Population will consist of all randomized subjects and both of their eyes, 
excluding any subjects who were ineligible based on Screening/Dispensing Visit 
assessments and randomized in error and not dispensed study lenses. Subjects will be 
included in ITT Population summaries according to the treatment group to which they were 
randomly assigned. 
7.5.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The PP population will be the primary population used for analysis of the primary 
effectiveness endpoint.  The PP Population will consist of all ITT Population subjects 
without important (major) protocol deviations for subject level summaries and, for eye 
level summaries, both of their eyes. Important protocol deviation categories are defined in 
Section 7.6.4 . Subjects will be included in PP Population summaries accord i ng to the 
treatment group to which they were randomly assigned.  The PP population will be 
determined prior to study unmasking. 
7.5.3 Safety Population 
The Safety Population will consist of all randomized subjects and, for eye level summaries, 
both of their eyes. Subjects will be included in Safety summaries according to the treatment 
that they received. If a subject receives more than one treatment and one of those treatments 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 39 of 79 
  
 is the Test device, then the subject will be included in Safety Population summaries under 
the Test tre a
tment group. 
7.6 Statistical Analysis 
7.6.1 Methods of Analysis 
7.6.1.1  General Methods 
Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics: sample size (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Categorical data will be 
presented using the total counts for each category and corresponding percentages. The 
denominator for each percentage will be the number of subjects or eyes with non-missing 
data at the given visit for each respective study treatment, unless otherwise indicated. 
As is customary for contact lens trials, eyes will be treated as independent sampling units 
in eye level analyses unless otherwise noted. 
Further details will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan which will be 
completed and approved prior to unmasking of the treatment assignments. 
Data will be summarized for all subjects and, for a Japanese submission only, separately 
for the Japanese subjects.   Primary Effectiveness Endpoint Analysis 
 
 
7.6.1.2   Primary Effectiveness Endpoint Analysis 
Monocular distance high-contrast VA will be assessed while wearing the study lens at the 
Screening/Dispensing visit and all scheduled follow-up visits. For each eye visit, the 
number of letters read correctly will be recorded in the case report form. The number of 
letters read correctly will be converted to a logMAR value. For each eye, the average of 
the non-missing logMAR VA values at the scheduled visits (Screening/Dispensing and 
follow-up visits) will be computed. 
The average of the non-missing logMAR VA values at scheduled visits 
(screening/dispensing and all follow-up visits) will be summarized using continuous 
summary statistics for the PP Population in a table at the eye level. An analysis of variance 
model will be constructed using the PP Population with a response variable of average 
logMAR VA and fixed factors of treatment and site. The least squares mean and standard 
error will be displayed by treatment group in a table. In addition, the least squares mean 
difference between treatment groups (test minus control) will be displayed. An upper one-
sided 95% confidence limit for the difference between treatment groups will be presented. 
If the confidence limit is less than 0.06, then the null hypothesis that the Test lens is not 
non-inferior to the Control lens will be rejected, and the Test lens will be statistically 
successful in this outcome. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the ITT population will be used to test the hypothesis. Summaries 
by treatment will be provided as described above using the available data. Missing data 
will be multiply imputed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.  
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 40 of 79 
  
 7.6.1.3  Primary Sa f ety Endpoint Analysis 
At each follow-up visit, graded slit lamp findings will be assessed for each eye using 
Grades 0 through 4. Using only the non-missing observations from all visits without 
imputation, each eye will be classified with respect to findings greater than Grade 2 at any 
visit (Absent, Present). Missing data will not be imputed. Greater than Grade 2 findings 
(Absent, Present) will be summarized at the eye level by treatment using categorical 
summary statistics for the Safety Set in a table. A one-sided upper 95% confidence limit 
around the difference in “Present” proportions between the test and control treatment 
groups will be constructed using the Newcombe-Wilson score method. If the upper 
confidence limit is less than 5%, then the null hypothesis that the Test lens is not non-
inferior will be rejected, and the Test lens will be statistically successful in this outcome. 
7.6.1.4  Definition of Statistical Success 
The test device will be statistically successful if it is successful in both primary endpoints.  
7.6.2 Subject Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment 
and overall for the ITT, PP, and Safety Populations. Demographics and baseline 
characteristics will also be listed. 
7.6.3 Subject Discontinuation 
The reasons for study discontinuation will be summarized by treatment and overall for the 
ITT Population. Details of discontinued eyes will be also listed by treatment. 
7.6.4 Protocol Deviations 
Important (major) protocol deviations will be summarized by category and treatment group 
for the ITT Population in a table.  
Categories of important protocol deviations will include the following, which will be 
derived via data entered on the case report forms or in the randomization system. 
• Ineligibility 
• Not dispensed study treatment 
• Misrandomization 
• Dispensing of the incorrect lens (type or prescription) 
• Use of medications that could potentially affect the primary effectiveness 
endpoint 
Failure to comply with the procedures used to assess the primary effectiveness endpoint, 
such as missing a scheduled visit or failing to complete the procedure in accordance with 
instructionsAdditional important protocol deviation categories may be added prior to 
unmasking. 
Important (major) protocol deviations will also be displayed in a listing. 
7.6.5 Treatment Compliance 
As is customary for contact lens trials, treatment compliance will not be evaluated. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 41 of 79 
  
 7.6.6 Treatment Exposure 
As is cust o
mary for contact lens trials, treatment exposure will not be evaluated. 
7.6.7 Missing Data 
Imputation of missing data is not conservative in a non-inferiority analysis setting. 
Therefore, primary effectiveness analyses will be completed using the PP Set without 
imputation of missing data. 
Sensitivity analyses of data from the ITT Set with missing data imputation are described 
in Section 7.6.1.2 . Unless otherwise specified in the protocol or statistical a n alysis plan, 
missing data will not be imputed. 
7.6.8 Multiple Comparisons 
The test lens must be successful in both primary endpoint analyses to achieve overall 
statistical success. Therefore, no adjustments for multiple comparisons are needed.  
7.6.9 Interim Analyses 
No interim analyses are planned. 
 
8.0 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
8.1 Study Monitoring 
Bausch + Lomb representatives must be allowed to visit all study site locations to assess 
the data, quality, and study integrity in a manner consistent with applicable health authority 
regulations and the procedures adopted by Bausch + Lomb.  
Prior to the start of the study, member(s) of Bausch + Lomb (or designees) will review the 
protocol, eCRF, regulatory obligations, and other material or equipment relevant to the 
conduct of the study with the Investigator/Sub-Investigator and relevant study site 
personnel.  
Monitoring visits and telephone consultations will occur as necessary, or per the 
monitoring plan, during the course of the investigation to verify the following: 
• the rights and well-being of subjects are protected 
• the conduct of the investigation is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/ a
mendment, 21CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, 812, and 42 USC 282(j); and with 
consideration of the provisions in: ISO 14155-1:2011 Clinical investigation of medical 
devices for human subjects – Part 1:  General requirements; 14155-2:2011 Part 2:  
Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects – Part 2:  Clinical 
investigational plan; ISO 11980:2012 Ophthalmic Optics – Contact lenses and contact 
lens care products – Guidance for clinical investigations; ICH, GCPs, and applicable 
local regulations 
• the integrity of the data, including adequate study documentation 
• the facilities remain acceptable

Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 42 of 79 
  
 • the Investigator and site personnel remains qualified and able to conduct the study 
• study lenses accountability (at the conclusion of each site’s participation) 
During the
 course of the study, if the Sponsor determines that an Investigator is not 
compliant with the protocol and/or applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor will 
take action to secure compliance. In addition, the Sponsor may terminate the Investigator’s 
participation in the study if appropriate, or if the Investigator remains  
non-compliant despite the Sponsor’s actions. 
Full details for site monitoring procedures are covered in the BL890 Monitoring Plan.  
8.2 Source Documentation 
All medical information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject’s 
record (source documentation) in real time as it is collected. Source documentation consists 
of original subject documents, as well as data and records with information relevant to the 
subject and his/her participation in the study.  
Examples of source documents include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, signed ICF, evaluation checklists, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate 
copies, and information initially recorded in an electronic format. Source documentation 
worksheets may be provided by the Sponsor to record pertinent information.  
Subject completed forms are also considered to be source data. For this study, this includes 
the Family Tree Worksheet that is to be completed by subjects who are of Japanese ancestry. 
Only subjects are to record information in the in the Family Tree Worksheet.  In no instance 
should an Investigator or study site personnel record any data or make changes to subject 
completed forms. The Investigator or designee should review subject completed forms 
during study visits for completeness and accuracy. If an entry is found to be illegible or a 
mistake is found (e.g., incorrect year was recorded), the subject should be instructed to edit 
the entry by drawing a single line through the original entry, entering the new information, 
and dating and initialing the change.  
8.3 Case Report Forms and Data Verification 
Subject data required by this protocol are to be transferred from the source to the eCRFs. 
The Investigator and his/her study site personnel will be responsible for completing the 
eCRFs. The Investigator is required to verify that all of the requested information is 
accurately recorded on the eCRFs by providing an electronic signature. All information 
requested on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subject identification and initials, 
date(s), assessment values, etc, and any omission or discrepancy will require explanation. 
All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source documents.  
The study monitor will be responsible for reviewing and verifying the data recorded on the 
eCRFs per the study Monitoring Plan, utilizing the original source documentation and will 
query discrepant findings. The Investigator and study site personnel will be responsible for 
answering all queries.  
Details regarding procedures used for data review, database cleaning and issuing and 
resolving queries are provided in the BL890 Monitoring Plan and Data Management Plan.

  APPENDIX B:  METHODS OF C LINICAL EVALUATION  
Maintenance and calibration of the equipment relevant to study assessments must be 
appropriately performed and documented by the investigative site, where applicable.  Any 
Any changes to the procedures described in this appendix will be provided under separate 
cover. 
1.0 Visual Acuity/Refraction 
It is essential that a standard procedure be used to obtain VA measurements. The VA and 
refraction measurements should be obtained by a physician, optometrist, or trained 
technician. One standard logMAR chart, high 90% contrast, with Sloan letters will be used 
to obtain the VA measurements in this study. The following VA equipment from Precision 
Vision, Inc. will be used in this study: 90% High Contrast 6.5 feet (2.0 meters) testing 
distance Translucent Chart (CAT. NO. 2103-2), and the Precision Vision Small Illuminator 
Cabinet (CAT. NO. 914). 
1.1 Illumination of the logMAR Chart and Room Illumination 
The internal illumination of the logMAR chart should be turned on. This will provide the 
nominal contrast for each of the charts. Room illumination should be turned off , to 
ensure that the illumination is consistent for each measurement. Ambient sources of light 
in the room, such as computer monitors, should be turned off or covered. A small source 
of illumination may be used to allow recording of data and to ensure that it is not difficult 
or dangerous for staff or subjects to move around the testing area, but these light sources 
should not be placed so that they are directed toward the subject during testing. The room 
lighting and any ambient sources should be consistent in their use and placement at each 
subject visit throughout the course of this study. 
1.2 Determination of High Contrast Visual Acuity 
The subject should be seated so that the distance from the subject’s eyes to the logMAR 
chart is 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). The chart should be at eye level for the subject. The logMAR 
charts have two alternative letter sequences from 28 letters (0.3 logMAR) to  
62 letters (-0.3 logMAR). It is recommended that one letter sequence is used for the right 
eye, and the second letter sequence is used for the left eye, to minimize learning effects at 
each visit. Care should be taken to completely occlude the eye not being measured.  
Since the test distance of the chart is not at optical infinity, refractive power compensation 
is required to simulate optical infinity. The VA should be measured through the 
phoropter using the distance refractive correction with the addition of  
+0.50 D to compensate for the reduced test distance of 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). 
If all letters are correctly identified on any given line, then the subject is encouraged to read 
the next smaller line. When the subject says they cannot read a letter, they should be 
required to guess. A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter. A scoring 
sheet for each eye is provided to keep track of the letters correctly identified by writing an 
“X” over the incorrectly identified letter. The subject continues reading down the chart to 
the last letter of a given line, until the subject has missed 3 letters on a line with 5 letters . 
The incorrect letters can occur at the beginning, middle, or end of this line and do not have 
to be consecutive.

  1.3 Recording and Scoring logMAR Values 
Using the 
Sponsor supplied recording/scoring sheet, an example of which is shown below, 
the tester will record the actual VA measurement. 
The number of letters CORRECT will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet in the far 
right box on the corresponding line. The lines will then be added up and the “TOTAL” 
number of letters correctly identified will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet. The 
“TOTAL” is the number that will be entered onto the eCRF.  
Example of Distance VA: 
In the example below, all letters in lines 1 through 8 were read correctly. Line 9 had  
4 correct responses, and line 10 had only 1 correct response. After line 10, the VA test 
would be considered complete. In this example, the total letters correctly identified is 42. 
This number is recorded in the space marked “TOTAL” and also recorded on the eCRF.

4.0 Method 
for the Examination, Description and Classification of Lens Fit at all 
Visits 
The following procedure has been developed to assist in the examination, description, and 
classification of contact lenses fit at all visits in the Investigator’s office. 
Materials needed:   Slit Lamp 
Procedure:  Each lens should be examined on the eye using the slit lamp employing a 7X 
to 15X magnification. 
Lens fit will be assessed utilizing the scales below: 
I. Lens Centration  
Enter Rating 0 – 3: 
Qualitative Lens Centration 
• Compare lens edge overlap of limbus in all visible sectors. 
• The centration diagram is pictured as lateral decentration toward 9:00 on the clock 
dial. Centration assessment applies to all clock hours. 
o If the limbus is an ill-defined band, assess from the center of the band. 
o If the contact lens edge translates with blinking, assess to the average lens 
edge position. 
o Centration assessment applies to primary gaze. 
o If the inferior edge of the contact lens is not visible, gently pull the lower 
eyelid away. 
• Rate and record lens centration on a scale of 0 to 3 based on the following lens 
diagrams and descriptors: 
 
0) Equal Overlap 360 degrees 
1) Maximum overlap ≤  2/3 in any sector 
2) Maximum ov e
rlap > 2/3 in any sector 
3) Any Corneal Exposure 
 
II. Lens Movement  
• As the subject blinks normally, observe lens movement, with particular attention 
to the inferior portion of the lens. 
o All movement depicted in the diagram below is from the absolute centered 
position. 
o All movement descriptions apply from the various decentered positions. 
o Corneal exposure in any sector is an unacceptable fit.

  o If the inferior edge of the contact lens is not visible, gently pull the lower 
eyelid awa
y. 
 
• Rate and record lens movement on a scale of -2 to +2 based on the following lens 
diagrams and descriptors: 
 
-2 - No observable movement (perform Josephson push-up test, see below) 
-1 - Minimal; Just observable movement, lens returns to origin. 
 0 - Optimal/Free movement, lens returns to origin.  
+1 - Substantial movement; but lens does not immediately return to origin. 
+2 - Excessive movement; lens does not return to origin, may result in corneal exposure. 
 
Josephson Push Up Test 
• Use Josephson Push-up test when specified or indicated (-2 = No observable lens 
movement, see lens movement ratings above). 
o Apply gentle upward digital pressure to the lower lid such that the lower 
lid margin pushes on the inferior aspect of the contact lens edge. 
• Determine if this action causes the contact lens to move and rate as follows: 
1 - Lens is mobile 
2 - Lens is immobile

INTRODUCTION  
You will participate in this study designed to evaluate the product performance of an 
investigational daily disposable contact lens (Test) when compared to the currently 
marketed Bausch + Lomb Biotrue ONE day® daily disposable contact lens (Control). As 
a participant in this study, you will be randomly assigned to wear either the Test or Control 
lenses on a daily disposable basis. Study lenses will be dispensed at the 
Screening/Dispensing and 1-Week Follow-up Visits. It is very important that you do not 
use any other contact lenses or solutions other than those dispensed to you during the 
study. 
You will wear the lenses on a daily disposable basis but do not discard your worn lenses. 
You will replace the lenses daily, any time you remove your lenses, or when removed from 
your eyes as indicated by the person who dispenses your study lenses. All lenses, used and 
unused, must be returned to the study site. It is essential to your safety that you read and 
understand the information and instructions in these Subject Instructions and have your 
study doctor answer any questions, both before and after you receive contact lenses. 
Do not discuss or describe your contact lenses with anyone except the person who 
gave you the study lenses at the Screening/Dispensing Visit . You should not show the 
study blister packs and foils to the Investigator or site staff unless instructed to do so. 
Please keep all appointments and follow these instructions thoroughly. If you have any 
questions or problems, call your study doctor at _________________.  
Note: Please schedule your 1-Week Follow-up, 1-Month Follow-up, 2-Month Follow-
up, and 3-Month Follow-up Visits at the Screening/Dispensing Visit.

  • Lens cases for storage of worn study lenses (up to 10 pairs of lenses, stacked dry). 
 
GENERAL IN
FORMATION 
Do NOT use any products other than those dispensed to you by your study doctor for use 
in this study. 
If problems or symptoms should occur, immediately remove your lenses and follow the 
steps described in the sections of these instructions entitled Warnings and Adverse Effects . 
Prompt attention to problems is essential and may require immediate professional care. 
Remember, when wearing contact lenses, your eyes should look and feel good and your 
vision should be clear. 
Because they are worn directly on your eyes, contact lenses affect the way in which your 
eyes function. These effects tend to increase with the length of time the lenses remain on 
your eyes between removals. Although the great majority of people successfully wear 
contact lenses without problems, before you decide whether to continue wearing contact 
lenses for daily disposable wear, you should discuss with your study doctor the effects of 
contact lenses on your eyes and the risks associated with wearing contact lenses. You also 
should read the sections of these instructions entitled “Warnings”, ”Adverse Reactions”, 
“Precautions”, and “Wearing Restrictions and Indications”. Ask your study doctor to 
explain anything that you do not understand, including any additional restrictions which 
may be given to you by your study doctor. These contact lenses have been prescribed for 
single-use disposable wear, and should be replaced each time lenses are removed from your 
eyes. 
You also need to remember that soft contact lenses, including those covered by these 
instructions, are made of a type of plastic that absorbs liquids, vapors and small particles, 
and for some people, may collect deposits from your natural eye fluids. Therefore, you 
should strictly follow these instructions and any other instructions given to you by your 
study doctor. Any failure to follow these instructions and the wearing restrictions will 
increase the chances of contamination, damage to the lenses, or a buildup of deposits on 
the lenses, which can lead to serious, sight-threatening eye infections and injuries. 
Adherence to your prescribed wearing schedule and regular check-up visits to your study 
doctor are also necessary for the proper and safe use of contact lenses. Soft contact lenses 
generally are comfortable from the beginning. Therefore, be sure to follow the wearing 
schedule prescribed for you, and do not over wear your lenses simply because they remain 
comfortable and you are not experiencing a problem. Only your study doctor, through a 
professional examination, can determine how your eyes are reacting to the contact lenses 
and whether there are any early signs of possible problems. 
Finally, if problems or symptoms should occur, immediately remove your lenses and 
follow the steps described in the section of these instructions entitled “Warnings and 
Adverse Reactions.” Prompt attention to problems is essential and may require 
immediately professional care. 
Remember, when wearing soft contact lenses your eyes should look and feel good, and 
your vision should be clear.

  1. WEARING RESTRICTIONS and INDICATIONS 
The lenses
 have been prescribed for single-use disposal wear, and will be replaced after 
each removal. 
− Keep a spare pair of lenses available in case you have to remove your lenses 
immediately upon the appearance of a problem or symptom. 
− Do not use aerosol products such as hair spray while wearing your lenses. The 
lenses may absorb the spray, resulting in injury to the eye and damage to the lens. 
− Avoid wearing the lenses around fumes, irritating vapors, smoky or dusty 
conditions. The lenses may absorb the chemicals or particles, resulting in injury to 
the eye. 
− Avoid rubbing your eyes with the lenses in, which can irritate the eye or dislodge 
the lens. 
− If you get something in your eye, remove the lens immediately. Do not replace with 
new lens until your eye feels normal. 
− Tell your regular physician and every other doctor that you visit, that you wear 
contact lenses and the type of lenses that you wear. If you are admitted to a hospital, 
also tell your nurses that you wear contact lenses. 
− A bottle of Sensitive Eyes® Drops will be dispensed to you at the 
Screening /
Dispensing Visit.  You may use these drops as needed throughout the 
study. Your Study Doctor can provide you with additional Drops should you need 
a new bottle. 
− Do not use any eye drops, ointments, or medicines in your eye unless they are 
specifically approved by your study doctor or physician. Some drops, ointments, or 
medicines will cause injury to the eye if used by a contact lens wearer. 
− Ask your study doctor whether there are any other wearing restrictions that apply 
to you, write those restrictions in the spaces provided below and follow them 
carefully.

  2. WARNINGS 
You shoul
d be aware of and fully discuss with your study doctor the following warnings 
pertaining to contact lens wear: 
− Problems with contact lenses could result in serious injury to your eye. It is essential 
that you follow your study doctor’s direction and all labeling instructions for proper 
use of lenses. Eye problems, including corneal ulcers, can develop rapidly and lead 
to loss of vision.  
− Daily disposable lenses are not indicated for overnight wear, and you should not 
wear lenses while sleeping.  Clinical studies have shown that the risk of serious 
adverse reactions is increased when daily disposable lenses are worn overnight. 
− Strict compliance with your wearing restrictions, wearing schedule, and follow-up 
visit schedule should be followed. 
− Studies have shown that contact lens wearers who are smokers have a higher 
incidence of adverse reactions than nonsmokers. 
− If you experience eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, or redness of 
the eye, you should immediately remove lenses and promptly contact your study 
doctor. 
3. PRECAUTIONS 
You should be aware of and fully discuss with your study doctor the following safety 
precautions: 
− Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions for lubricating 
or wetting your lenses. 
− If the lens sticks (stops moving) on your eye, follow the recommended directions 
on Care for a Sticking Lens. The lens should move freely on your eye for the 
continued health of your eye.  If non-movement of the lens continues, you should 
immediately consult your study doctor. Do not attempt to remove the lens, except 
on the instructions of your study doctor. 
− Always wash and rinse your hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, 
lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in your eyes or on the lenses. It is best 
to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water-base cosmetics are less likely to 
damage lenses than oil-base products. 
− Do not touch contact lenses with your fingers or hands if your hands are not free of 
foreign materials, as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing 
distorted vision and/or injury to your eye. 
− Carefully follow these handling, insertion, and wearing instructions for the daily 
disposable contact lenses and those instructions prescribed by your study doctor. 
− Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by your study doctor. 
− Always handle lenses gently and avoid dropping them. 
− Ask your study doctor about wearing lenses during water activities and other sports.

  − Inform your doctor (health care professional) about being a contact lens wearer. 
− Never use
 tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens container unless 
specifically indicated for that use. Pour the lens into your hand. 
− Do not touch the lens with your fingernails. 
− Always contact your study doctor before using any medicine in your eyes. 
− Always inform your employer of being a contact lens wearer. Some jobs may 
require use of eye protection equipment or may require that you not wear contact 
lenses. 
− As with any contact lens, follow-up visits are necessary to assure the continuing 
health of your eyes. Your study doctor should provide you with a recommended 
follow-up schedule. 
 
4. ADVERSE REACTIONS (Problems And What To Do) 
You should be aware that the following problems may occur: 
− Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain, 
− Comfort is less than when lens was first placed on eye, 
− Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area), 
− Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes, 
− Unusual eye secretions, 
− Redness of the eyes, 
− Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity), 
− Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects, 
− Sensitivity to light (photophobia), 
− Dry eyes. 
If you notice any of the above, you should: 
− Immediately remove your lenses. 
− If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens has dirt, 
an eyelash, or other foreign body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears 
undamaged, insert a new lens. After insertion of a new lens, if the problem 
continues, you should immediately remove the lenses and consult your study doctor. 
When any of the above problems occur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, 
neovascularization, or iritis may be present. You should keep the lens off your eye and seek 
immediately professional identification of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid 
serious eye damage. 
 
5. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS and LENS HANDLING

Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page C-6  
  − Preparing the Lens for Wearing: 
It is essential that you learn and use good hygienic methods in the care and handling of the 
lenses. Cleanliness is the first and most important aspect of proper contact lens care. In 
particular, your hands should be clean and free of any foreign substances when you handle 
your lenses. The procedures are: 
○ Always wash your hands thoroughly with mild soap, rinse completely, and dry 
with a lint-
free towel before touching your lenses. 
○ Avoid the use of soaps containing cold cream, lotion, or oily cosmetics before 
handling y
our lenses, since these substances may come into contact with the 
lenses and interfere with successful wearing. 
○ Handle your lenses with your fingertips, and be careful to avoid contact with 
fingernail
s. It is helpful to keep your fingernails short and smooth. 
○ Start off correctly by getting into the habit of always using proper hygienic 
procedures
 so that they become automatic. 
○ Should you accidentally place an inside-out lens on your eye, one of the 
following s
igns should signal you to remove and replace it correctly: 
▪ Less than usual comfort, 
▪ The lens may fold on the eye, 
▪ Excessive lens movement on blink, 
▪ Blurred vision. 
If the lens f
olds and sticks together: Place the lens in the palm of your hand and GENTLY 
rub the lens between your index finger and palm in a gentle back and forth motion. Replace 
the lens if it does not unfold. 
If the lens flattens or drapes across your finger, the lens or your finger may be too wet. To 
correct this, dry your finger by transferring the lens several times from one index finger to 
the other, drying the opposite finger each time. 
 
- Placing the Lens on the Eye: 
There are other methods of lens placement. If the following methods are difficult for you, 
your study doctor will provide you with an alternate method. 
Note :  If after placement of the lens, your vision is blurred, check for the following: 
○ The lens is not centered on the eye (see “Centering the Lens,” next in these 
instructio
ns). 
○ If the lens is centered, remove the lens (see “Removing the Lens” section) and 
check for th
e following: 
▪ Cosmetics or oils on the lens (replace the lens), 
▪ The lens is on the wrong eye, 
▪ The lens is inside-out (it would also not be as comfortable as normal). 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page C-7  
  If you find that your vision is still blurred after checking the above possibilities, remove 
both lenses
 and consult your eye professional. 
 
The One-Hand Placement Technique 
Place the lens on your index finger. Head up, looking straight ahead, pull down your lower 
eyelid with the middle finger of your placement hand. Look up steadily at a point above 
you. Then place the lens on the lower white part of your eye. Remove your index finger 
and slowly release the lower lid. Look down to position the lens properly. Close your eyes 
for a moment; the lens will center itself on your eye. 
The Two-Hand Placement Technique 
With the lens on your index finger, use the middle finger 
of the other hand to pull the upper lid against the brow. 
Use the middle finger of your placement hand to pull 
down the lower lid and then place the lens centrally on 
your eye. While holding this position, look downward to 
position the lens properly. Slowly release your eyelids. 
If the lens feels uncomfortable, then look in the mirror and 
gently place a finger on the edge of the contact lens and 
slowly slide the lens away from your nose while looking 
in the opposite direction. Then by blinking, the lens will 
re-center itself. If the lens still feels uncomfortable, follow 
the steps described in the section of these instructions 
entitled “Adverse Reactions.” 
 
− Centering the Lens : 
Very rarely, a lens that is on the cornea will be displaced onto the white part of the eye 
during lens wear. This can also occur during placement and removal of the lenses if the 
correct techniques are not performed properly. To center a lens, follow one of the 
procedures below. 
Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then while looking in a mirror, 
gently place a finger on the contact lens and gently slide the lens towards the center of the 
eye. 
Or 
Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then, while looking in a mirror, 
move your eye towards the lens to place it on the center of the eye. 
 
− Removing the Lens: 
Always remove the same lens first. 
1) Wash, rinse, and dry your hands thoroughly. 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page C-8  
  2) Always be sure that the lens is in the correct position on your eye before you try to 
remove it 
(a simple check of your vision, closing one eye at a time, will tell you if the lens 
is in the correct position). Look up and slowly pull down your lower eyelid with the middle 
finger of your removal hand and place your index finger on the lower edge of lens. Squeeze 
the lens lightly between the thumb and the index finger and remove it. Avoid sticking the 
edges of the lens together. 
3) Remove the other lens by following the same procedure. 
Note: If this method of removing your lens is difficult for you, your study doctor will 
provide you with an alternate method. 
 
− Care for a Sticking (Nonmoving) Lens: 
It is important to the health of your eyes that your contact lenses move freely. If a lens 
sticks (stops moving), put a few drops of the Bausch + Lomb Sensitive Eyes® Drops 
provided b
y your study doctor into your eye. In this case, do not use plain water or anything 
other than the recommended solutions. Do not attempt to remove a lens that is sticking, 
which could damage your eye. If the lens does not begin to move when you blink after 
several applications of the solution or, contact your study doctor immediately. Do not 
attempt to remove the lens except on the advice of your study doctor. 
 
6. EMERGENCIES 
If chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, 
etc.) are splashed into your eyes, you should: FLUSH EYES IMMEDIATELY WITH 
TAP WATER AND THEN REMOVE LENSES PROMPTLY.  CONTACT YOUR 
STUDY DOCTOR OR VISIT A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM WITHOUT 
DELAY.

  APPENDIX D:  FITTING GU IDE 
FOR SINGLE-USE DISPOSABLE WEAR 
CAUTION :  Investigational device. Limited by Federal law (U.S.A.) to investigational 
use. 
IMPORTANT 
This Fitting Guide has been developed to provide professionals with information covering 
characteristics of the investigational daily disposable contact lens and to illustrate fitting 
procedures. Please read carefully and keep this information for future use.  This Fitting 
Guide is intended for the eye care professional, but should be made available to subjects 
upon request. The eye care professional should provide the subject with the Subject 
Instructions that pertain to the subject’s prescribed lens, and the recommended wearing 
schedule. 
LENS PARAMETERS AVAILABLE (For the Test and Control lenses used in this 
study) 
Test and Control Articles:  
The description of the Test and Control daily disposable contact lenses is as follows: 
• Sphere Power: -0.25 D to -6.00 D in 0.25 D increments 
• Diameter: 14.2 mm 
• Base Curve: 8.6 mm 
• Materials: kalifilcon A (Test) and nesofilcon A (Control) 
HOW THE LE N
S WORKS (ACTIONS) 
In their hydrated state, when the contact lens is placed on the cornea, they act as a refracting 
medium to focus light rays on the retina.  
INDICATIONS 
The Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact lens is intended for the daily disposable wear 
correction of refractive ametropia (myopia and hyperopia) in aphakic and  
not-aphakic persons with non-diseased eyes, exhibiting astigmatism of 2.00 D or less, that 
does not interfere with visual acuity. The lenses may be prescribed in spherical powers 
ranging from -0.25 D to -6.00 D. The lenses have been prescribed for single-use disposal 
wear, and will be replaced after each removal. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS (REASONS NOT TO USE) 
DO NOT USE the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact lens when any of the following 
conditions exist: 
• Acute and subacute inflammation or infection of the anterior chamber of the eye, 
• Any eye disease, injury, or abnormality that affects the cornea, conjunctiva, or eyelids, 
• Severe insufficiency of lacrimal secretion (dry eyes), 
• Corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity), 
• Any systemic disease that may affect the eye or be exaggerated by wearing contact 
lenses,

  • Allergic reactions of ocular surfaces or adnexa (surrounding tissue) that may be 
induced or e
xaggerated by wearing contact lenses or use of contact lens solutions, 
• Any active corneal infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral), 
• If eyes become red or irritated. 
WARNINGS 
Af
ter a thorough eye examination, including appropriate medical background, subjects 
should be fully apprised by the prescribing professional of all the risks with contact lens 
wear. Subjects should be advised of the following warnings pertaining to contact lens wear: 
• Problems with contact lenses could result in serious i n jury to the eye. It is essential 
that subjects follow their eye care professional’s direction and all labeling instructions 
for proper use of lenses. Eye problems, including corneal ulcers, can develop rapidly 
and lead to loss of vision . 
• Daily disposable lenses are not indicated for overnight wear, and subjec ts should be 
instructed not to wear lenses while sleeping . Clinical studies have shown that the risk 
of serious adverse reactions is increased when daily disposable lenses are worn 
overnight. 
• Studies have shown that contact lens wearers who are smokers have a higher incidence 
of adverse r
eactions than nonsmokers. 
• If a subject experiences eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, or redness 
of the eye
, the subject should be instructed to immediately remove lenses  and 
promptly contact his or her eye care professional. 
PRECAUTIONS 
Precautions for Eye Care Professionals: 
• Due to the small number of subjects enrolled in clinical investigation of lenses, all 
refractiv e
 powers, design configurations, or lens parameters available in the lens 
material are not evaluated in significant numbers.  Consequently, when selecting an 
appropriate lens design and parameters, the eye care professional should consider all 
characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance and ocular health, including 
oxygen permeability, wettability, central and peripheral thickness, and optic zone 
diameter. 
• The potential impact of these factors on the subject’s ocular health should be carefully 
weighed ag
ainst the subject's need for refractive correction; therefore, the continuing 
ocular health of the subject and lens performance on eye should be carefully monitored 
by the prescribing eye care professional. 
• Fluorescein should not be used while the subject is wearing the lenses, because the 
lenses wil
l become discolored. Whenever fluorescein is used, flush the eyes with sterile 
saline solution.  Wait at least 5 minutes before inserting new lenses. If it is not possible 
to flush the eyes, wait a minimum of 1 hour before inserting new lenses. If inserted too 
soon, the lenses may absorb residual fluorescein. 
• Before leaving the eye care professional’s office, the subject should be able to promptly 
remove len s
es.

  • The lenses are prescribed for disposable wear, and are to be stored for return to the eye 
care profe
ssional once they are removed from the subject’s eye. It is important that 
subjects be instructed to always have available a pair of replacement lenses. In the event 
that a lens must be removed from the eye because of dust, a foreign body or other 
contaminant gets on the lens or the lens becomes dehydrated, the lens should be 
removed and replaced with a replacement lens. 
Eye care professionals should carefully instruct subjects about the following safety 
precautions: 
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recommended directions on Care 
for a Sti c
king Lens. The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of 
the eye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the subject should be instructed to 
immediately  consult his or her eye care professional. Do not attempt to remove the 
lens, except on the instructions of the eye care professional. 
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, lotions, 
soaps, crea
ms, deodorants, or sprays in the eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on 
lenses before putting on makeup. Water-base cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses 
than oil-base products. 
• Do not touch contact lenses with the fingers or hands if the hands are not free of foreign 
materials, 
as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision 
and/or injury to the eye. 
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, and wearing instructions in the 
Subject In
structions and those prescribed by the eye care professional. 
• Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by the eye care professional. 
• If aerosol products such as hair spray are used while wearing lenses, exercise caution 
and keep e y
es closed until the spray has settled. 
• Always handle lenses gently and avoid dropping them. 
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing lenses. 
• Ask the eye care professional about wearing lenses during water activities and other 
sports. 
• Info
rm the doctor (health care professional) about being a contact lens wearer. 
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens container unless 
specifical
ly indicated for that use. Pour the lens into the hand. 
• Do not touch the lens with fingernails. 
• Always contact the eye care professional before using any medicine in the eyes. 
• Always inform the employer of being a contact lens wearer. Some jobs may require 
use of eye
 protection equipment or may require that the subject not wear contact lenses. 
• As with any contact lens, follow-up visits are necessary to assure the continuing health 
of the subje
ct’s eyes. The subject should be instructed as to a recommended follow-up 
schedule. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page D-4  
  The subject should be informed that the following problems may occur: 
• Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain, 
• Comfort is less than when lens was first placed on eye, 
• Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area), 
• Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes, 
• Unusual eye secretions, 
• Redness of the eyes, 
• Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity), 
• Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects, 
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia), 
• Dry eyes. 
If the subj e
ct notices any of the above, he or she should be instructed to: 
• Immediately remove lenses. 
• If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens is in any 
way damage
d, do not put the lens back on the eye. Place the lens in the storage case 
and contact the eye care professional. If the lens has dirt, an eyelash, or other foreign 
body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears undamaged, the subject should 
insert a new lens. After insertion of a new lens, if the problem continues, the subject 
should immediately remove the lenses and consult the eye care professional . 
If the above symptoms continue after removal of the lens, or upon insertion of a new lens, 
the subject should immediately remove the lenses and contact his or her eye care  
professional  or physician, who must determine the need for examination, treatment or 
referral without delay. 
(See Important Treatment Information for Adverse Reactions.) A serious condition such as 
infection, corneal ulcer, corneal vascularization, or iritis may be present, and may progress 
rapidly. Less serious reactions such as abrasions, epithelial stinging or bacterial 
conjunctivitis must be managed and treated carefully to avoid more serious complications. 
IMPORTANT TREATMENT INFORMATION FOR ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Sight-threatening ocular complications associated with contact lens wear can develop 
rapidly, and therefore early recognition and treatment of problems are critical. Infectious 
corneal ulceration is one of the most serious potential complications, and may be 
ambiguous in its early stage. 
Signs and symptoms of infectious corneal ulceration include discomfort, pain, 
inflammation, purulent discharge, sensitivity to light, cells and flare and corneal infiltrates.  
Initial symptoms of a minor abrasion and an early-infected ulcer are sometimes similar. 
Accordingly, such epithelial defect, if not treated properly, may develop into an infected 
ulcer. In order to prevent serious progression of these conditions, a subject presenting 
symptoms of abrasions or early ulcers should be evaluated as a potential medical 
emergency, treated accordingly, and be referred to a corneal specialist when appropriate.

  Standard therapy for corneal abrasions such as eye patching or the use of steroids or 
steroid/an
tibiotic combinations may exacerbate the condition. If the subject is wearing a 
contact lens on the affected eye when examined, the lens should be removed immediately 
and the lens and lens care products retained for analysis and culturing. 
SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 
Persons who require vision correction and who would not or could not adhere to the 
replacement regimen for the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact lenses or are unable 
to place and remove the lenses should not be provided with them. Failure to follow handling 
instructions could lead to serious eye infections, which might result in corneal ulcers. 
Subject communication is vital because it relates not only to subject selection but also to 
ensure compliance. It is also necessary to discuss the information contained in the Subject 
Instructions with the subject at the time of the initial examination. Subjects selected to wear 
the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact lens should be chosen for their motivation to 
wear contact lenses, general health, and cooperation. The eye care professional must take 
care in selecting, examining, and instructing contact lens subjects. Subject hygiene and 
willingness to follow eye care professional instructions are essential to their success. 
A detailed history is crucial to determining subject needs and expectations. Your subject 
should be questioned regarding vocation, desired lens-wearing time (full or part time), and 
desired lens usage (reading, recreation or hobbies). Initial evaluation of the lens should be 
preceded by a complete eye examination, including visual acuity, keratometry, and slit 
lamp examination. 
It is normal for the subject to experience mild symptoms such as lens awareness, variable 
vision, occasional tearing (watery eyes), and slight redness during the adaptation period.  
Although the adaptation period varies for each individual, generally within one week these 
symptoms will disappear. If these symptoms persist, the subject should be instructed to 
contact his or her eye care professional. 
FITTING PROCEDURE 
1. Pre-fitting Examination 
A pre-fitting subject history and examination are necessary to: 
− determine whether a subject is a suitable candidate for daily disposable contact 
lenses (co n
sider subject hygiene and mental and physical state), 
− make ocular measurements for initial contact lens parameter selection, and 
− collect and record baseline clinical information to which post-fitting examination 
results can
 be compared. 
A pre-fitting examination should include spherocylindrical refraction and VA, keratometry, 
and biomicroscopic examination. 
2. Initial Lens Power Selection 
− Lens power is determined from the subject's spherical equivalent prescription 
corrected t
o the corneal plane. 
− Select the appropriate power lens and place the lens on the eye. Allow the lens to 
remain on  
the eye long enough (3 minutes) to achieve a state of equilibrium. Small 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page D-6  
  variations in the tonicity, pH of the lens solutions, and individual tear composition 
may cause s
light changes in fitting characteristics. 
− Allow any increase in tear flow to subside before evaluating the lens. The time 
required wi
ll vary with the individual. 
3. Initial Lens Evaluation 
− To determine proper lens parameters observe the lens relationship to the eye using 
a slit lamp. 
○
 Movement: The lens should provide discernible movement with: 
▪ Primary gaze blink 
▪ Up gaze blink 
▪ Up gaze lag 
○ Centration: The lens should provide full corneal coverage. 
− Lens evaluation allows the contact lens fitter to evaluate the lens/cornea 
relations h
ip in the same manner as would be done with any soft lens. 
4. Criteria of a Well-Fitted Lens 
If the initial lens selection fully covers the cornea, provides discernible movement after a 
blink, is comfortable and provides satisfactory visual performance, it is a well-fitted lens 
and can be dispensed. 
5. Characteristics of a Tight (Steep) Lens 
A lens which is much too steep may subjectively and objectively cause distortion which 
will vary after a blink. However, if a lens is only marginally steep, the initial subjective 
and objective vision and comfort findings may be quite good. A marginally steep lens may 
be differentiated from a properly fitted lens by having the subject gaze upward. A properly 
fitted lens will tend to slide downward approximately 0.5mm while a steep lens will remain 
relatively stable in relationship to the cornea, particularly with the blink. 
6. Characteristics of a Loose (Flat) Lens 
If the lens is too flat, it will: 
− Decenter, especially on post-blink. 
− Have a tendency to edge lift inferiorly and sit on the lower lid, rather than 
positioni n
g between the sclera and palpebral conjunctiva. 
− Have a tendency to be uncomfortable and irritating with fluctuating vision. 
− Have a tendency to drop or lag greater than 2.0 mm on up-gaze post-blink. 
7. Follow-u
p Care 
− From the day of dispensing, the following schedule is required for this study. 
○ 1-Week Follow-Up Visit 
○ 1-Month Follow-Up Visit 
○ 2-Month Follow-Up Visit 
○ 3-Month Follow-Up Visit

  − Prior to a follow-up examination, the contact lenses should be worn for 
approximat
ely 1 continuous hour and the subject should be asked to identify any 
problems which might be occurring related to contact lens wear. 
− With lenses in place on the eyes, evaluate fitting performance to assure that 
CRITERIA OF 
A WELL FITTED LENS continue to be satisfied. Examine the 
lenses closely for surface deposition and/or damage. 
− After the lens removal, instill sodium fluorescein (unless contraindicated) into the 
eyes and con
duct a thorough biomicroscopy examination. 
○ The presence of vertical corneal striae in the posterior central cornea and/or 
corneal ne o
vascularization may be indicative of excessive corneal edema. 
○ The presence of corneal staining and/or limbal-conjunctival hyperemia can be 
indicative
 of an unclean lens, a reaction to solution preservatives, excessive lens 
wear, and/or a poorly fitting lens. 
○ Papillary conjunctival changes may be indicative of an unclean and/or damaged 
lens.  If a
ny of the above observations are judged abnormal, various 
professional judgments are necessary to alleviate the problem and restore the 
eye to optimal conditions.  
WEARING SCHEDULE 
The wearing and daily disposable schedules should be determined by the eye care 
professional. Regular checkups, as determined by the eye care professional, are extremely 
important. 
Daily Disposable: 
There may be a tendency for the daily disposable subject to over-wear the lenses initially. 
Therefore, the importance of adhering to a proper, initial daily disposable schedule should 
be stressed to these subjects. The wearing schedule should be determined by the eye care 
professional. The wearing schedule chosen by the eye care professional should be provided 
to the subject. The lens is to be prescribed for single-use disposable wear, and is to be 
replaced after each removal. 
All subjects should be supplied with a copy of the Subject Instructions.

  HANDLING OF LENSES 
When lense
s are dispensed, the subject should be provided with appropriate and adequate 
instructions and warnings for lens handling. The eye care professional should recommend 
appropriate and adequate procedures for each individual subject in accordance with the 
particular lens-wearing schedule. 
CARE FOR A STICKING (NONMOVING) LENS 
If the lens sticks (stops moving), the subject should be instructed to use their study 
rewetting drops in their eye. The subject should be instructed to not use plain water, or 
anything other than the recommended solutions. The subject should be instructed to contact 
the eye care professional if the lens does not begin to move upon blinking after several 
applications of the solution, and to not attempt to remove the lens except on the advice of 
the eye care professional. 
REPORTING OF ADVERSE REACTIONS 
All serious adverse experiences and adverse reactions observed in subjects wearing the 
Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact lens should be reported according to the Protocol. 
HOW SUPPLIED 
The lenses are provided individually in a plastic blister containing sterile saline packaging 
solution. Each container is marked with the manufacturing lot number of the lens, power, 
base curve, and expiration date.

Investigational 
Product (Test):Human Plasma -Derived Fibrinogen Concentrate Grifols (FIB 
Grifols):
A Ty pe II glass vial containing 1.0 g of Fibrinogen 
(powder for infusion).
A Ty pe II glass vial containing 50 mL of sterile water for 
injection (SWFI ) as solvent.
Indication: Treatment of subjects with congenital afibrinogenemia (fibrinogen 
deficiency )
Trial Phase: I/II
Trial Sites: Multi -center stud yisplanned to be conducted in multiple sites in 
multiple countries including India, Italy (European Union), 
Turkey , Lebanon, and the United States of America (USA).
Study Objectives: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy , and safet y of human 
plasma -derived fibrinogen concentra te FIB Grifols after a single-
dose 70 mg/kg bod y weight administration.
Trial Design: This study  is a phase I-II, multi- center, prospective, open -label, 
single -arm clinical study  to evaluate the PK, efficacy , and safety  of 
human plasma -derived fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols in adult 
and pediatric subjects with congenital afibrinogenemia . 
Approximately  10 adult subjects (≥18 years) with congenital 
afibrinogenemia will be administered a single dose of study  drug 
                                                Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0     Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 6of 103
at 70 mg/kg body  weight and will be followed for PK, efficacy , 
and safet y assessments.  
After the safet y of fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols is assessed 
in at least 10 adult subjects and no safet y issues are raised by the 
sponsor, the study  will start to enroll approximately  10 pediatric 
subje cts (<18 years) who will be dosed with study  drug and 
followed for PK, efficacy, and safet y assessments.
All enrolled subjects (both adult and pediatric) will have 
documented congenital fibrinogen deficiency  manifested as 
afibrinogenemia but will not have received any  fibrinogen -
containing product therapy within the preceding 21 day s before the  
infusion of study  drug.
All subjects (both adult and pediatric) will be infused with the 
investigational product at 70 mg/kg bod y weight. PK parameters  
that will b e calculated from plasma fibrinogen levels measured at 
different time points include: incremental in vivo recovery  (IVR), 
area under the curve (AUC) calculated as AUC from zero to 14 
days (AUC 0-14days ) and AUC from zero to infinity  (AUC 0-∞), 
maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to the observed 
maximum plasma concentration (t max), half -life (t 1/2), mean 
residence time (MRT), volume of distribution (Vd), and clearance 
(Cl).
Hemostatic efficacy  of the investigational product will be assessed 
by means of rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measure of 
maximum clot firmness (MCF) at baseline and 1-hour post -
infusion. Other thromboelastographic measures as well as standard 
coagulation tests will be also determined pre -and post -infusion.
Clinical safety , virus safety , and immunogenicit y will be assessed 
in this clinical trial. Safety variables include adverse events (AEs), 
vital signs, phy sical assessments, laboratory  tests, viral markers, 
and antibodies against human fibrinogen.
Allergic/ hypersensitivity  reactions and thrombotic events will be 
monitored during the study .
Stopping criteria have been established for immunogenic and 
thrombogenic events. Briefly , if a confirmed, single case of any  of 
these events is reported after a subject ha s been dosed with study  
drug, an y further enrollment and dosing of subjects in the study  
will be suspended until the event can be adequately  assessed by  the 
sponsor. The enrollment and dosing will only  resume after explicit 
authorization by  the sponsor.
Study Population 
and Sample Size:Adult and pediatric subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency  
manifested as afibrinogenemia .
Ten (10) evaluable adult subjects ( ≥18 y ears) will be sufficient for

subjects )
The f ollowing tests, indicative of activation of the coagulation: D-
dimer, ATIII, thrombin- antithrombin III complex (TAT), and F 1+2
will be performed on f rozen plasma samples taken at several time 
points throughout the study according to the schedule shown in 
Table 4-1and  Table 4-3by the central laboratory  of the study .
Immunogenicit y
(not applicable for pediatric subjects)
Serum/plasma samples taken only  from adult subjects at several 
time points throughout the study  according to the schedule shown 
in Table 4-1and  Table 4-3will be anal yzed for the generation of 
antibodies to fibrinogen by  using a stepwise approach starting with 
a functional screening assay  to detect neutralizing activity . In the 
event neutralizing activity is detected ,samples will be further 
assessed b y a confirmatory ELISA for the presence of antibodies 
to fibrinogen.   
An additional aliquot of serum/plasma will be retained from all 
immunogenicit y testing time points for re -testing if necessary .
Viral panel (not appl icable for pediatric subjects)
Viral monitoring for each adult subject will be performed b y 
means of serology  and nucleic acid amplification technology  
(NAT) tests for following viruses: HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV -1 and 
HIV-2, and B19.
Serum /plasma samples from al l subjects will be examined at 
baseline (prior to infusion on Day  0) and at different time points 
according to the schedule shown in Table 4-1,Table 4-2, and 
Table 4-3.
All serum /plasma samples will be sent to the central laboratory  of 
the study  for measurement of viral status. I
n case a subject is found 
to be positive for a particular virus at baseline, tests for this 
particular virus will not be performed at later time points during 
the study .
An additional aliquot of serum /plasma will be retained from all 
viral time points for re -testing if necessary .
Infusion and vital signs
During the treatment infusion, all subjects’ vital s igns (T, RR, HR, 
SBP, and DBP) will be monitored. Monitoring will be performed 
within 60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion, at the 
completion of the infusion, and within 30 minutes after conclusion 
of each infusion. During the infusion, vitals signs will be recorded 
every  20 ± 5 minutes.
                                                Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0     Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 15of 103
The rate of infusion will be controlled b y means of an infusion 
pump at a constant rate of not more than 5 mL /minute (it is 
acceptable to titrate up to this rate at the investigator’s discretion). 
If an AE occurs during the infusion, the infusion rate may  be 
reduced or the infusion may  be interrupted until sy mptoms 
subside. Subsequently , the infusion may  be resumed at a rate 
tolerated b y the subject, but not exceeding 5mL/minute.
Adverse events
AEs occurring at an y time between signature of the informed 
consent and the last day  of the subject’s participation in the safet y 
follow -up period (Week 4 Visit) after investigational medicinal 
product infusion will be reported on the appropriate subject’s case 
report form ( CRF/eCRF). Nature, severit y, seriousness 
(serious/non-serious) and causal- relationship to the study  product 
will be assessed. Infusional AEs (ie, AEs temporally  associated 
with an infusion of investigational product) will be defined and 
reported. An y AE oc curred during infusion or within 24 and 
72hours after completion of infusion will be considered 
temporally  associated with the infusion and labelled as infusional 
AEs.
Monitoring of immunogenicity
Evidence of an y possible immunogenicit y of the investigati onal 
product will be assessed by  assay ing for appearance of antibodies 
to fibrinogen. If a confirmed, single case of immunogenicity  is 
reported after a subject was dosed with study  drug, any  further 
enrollment and dosing of subjects in the study  will be suspended 
until the event can be adquately  assessed by  the safet y group of the 
sponsor. The enrollment and dosing will only  resume after explicit 
authorization by  the sponsor.
Monitoring of allergic/h ypersensitivity  reactions  
Subjects will be carefully mon itored for signs and sy mptoms of 
allergic/h ypersensitivity  reactions. The Grifols Medical Monitor 
will routinely  review reported AEs for possible 
allergic/h ypersensitivity  reactions. 
Monitoring of thrombotic events
Subjects will be monitored for signs and symptoms of arterial and 
venous thromboses. In addition, the Grifols Medical Monitor will 
routinely  review reported AEs for possible thromboses. Arterial 
and venous thromboses will be identified according to definitions 
in the I nternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification (I CD-9-CM). Such thrombotic events 
include, but are not limited to, DVT, pu lmonary  embolism (PE), 
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute coronary  
                                                Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0     Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 16of 103
syndrome, limb thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, and portal 
vein or mesenteric artery  thrombosis. All thromboses will be 
recorded as AEs and reported accordingl y. If a confirmed single 
case of thrombotic event is reported b y an investigator after a 
subject was dosed with study  drug, any  furth er enrollment and 
dosing of subjects in the study  will be suspended until the event 
can be adquatel y assessed by  the sponsor. The enrollment and 
dosing will only  resume after explicit authorization by  the sponsor. 
Concomitant medication
All medications, other than the investigational product, 
administered to subjects will be recorded during the clinical study .

Concomitant 
MedicationsUse of the following medications is prohibited during stud y 
participation: 
Aspirin -containing products and NSAI Ds
Analytical 
Plan/Statistical 
Method:The sample size in this study  is based on the PK assessment. The 
sample size of 10 adult subjects is deemed sufficient for PK 
assessments. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, a total of 11 adult 
subjects need to be enrolled . In this study , the 10 adult subjects 
will be enrolled first. Only  after the safet y of the product has been 
assessed in these adults, will 10 pediatric subjects be enrolled into 
the study . Assuming a 10% dropout rate, a total of 11 pediatric 
subjects need to be enrolled.
PK analy sis
The PK population will consist of all subjects who have received 
study  medication and have sufficient fibrinogen plasma 
concentration data to facilitate calculation of PK parameters. The 
PK population will be used for the anal yses of the PK parameters. 
PK analy sis will be performed independentl y for the adult and 
pediatric populations.
All PK parameters will be calculated using non -compartmental 
methods using the fibrinogen concentration values obtained by  
both Clauss method and antigen (ELISA) methods.
Efficacy  anal ysis
Primary  efficacy  anal ysis will be performed on the evaluable 
population. I n addition, efficacy  anal ysis will be also run on the 
per protocol (PP) population if it is different from the evaluable 
population. 
The evaluable population will include all individuals who received 
the investigational product of an y amount and who have at least 
two measurements for the primary  efficacy  variable: one pre -
infusion MCF and one 1 -hour post -infusion MCF measurement b y

population (both adult and pediatric populations). FIB Grifols 
safet y will also be assessed independentl y for both adult and 
pediatric populations.
All AEs occurring in subjects who are infused with study  drug will 
be listed in the clinical report of the study . Treatment -emergent 
AEs will be listed and tabulated by  body  system and they  will be 
summarized by  presenting individual incidences and percentages. 
In addition, treatment -emergent AEs will be also summarized by  
severit y (intensity), seriousn ess (serious versus non -serious) and 
causal -relationship to the study  product. Similarly , all treatment -
emergent AEs potentiall y related to the investigational product 
will be summarized by  presenting individual incidences and 
percentages, and will be also summarized by  severity  (intensit y) 
and seriousness (serious versus non- serious).
Infusional AEs will be defined as an y AE that occurred during 
infusion or within 
24 and 72 hours after completion of infusion. 
Infusional AEs will be summarized by  presenting
infusion’s/subject’s incidences and percentages (each subject 
contributes a single count to a category). AEs will be also 
tabulated by whether or not the AE occurred during the infusion or 
within 24 and 72 hours after completion of the infusion.
Subjects 
who die, report a serious AE (SAE), or withdraw from the 
study  because of AEs will be also individually  listed and 
summarized.
Events of special interest such as allergic/h ypersensitivity  
reactions and thrombotic events will be individually listed and 
summ arized.
Vital signs (T, RR, HR, SBP, DBP) will be listed for each subject. 
Clinically  relevant vital signs variations will be flagged.
Clinical laboratory  data for renal (creatinine, BUN), hepatic (ALT, 
AST, AL P, TB) and haematological parameters (CBC, inc luding 
differential leukocy te count) will be listed for each subject. Values 
outside the upper or lower limit of the normal range for the 
respective testing laboratory  will be flagged.
For virus safet y, the proportion of adult subjects who 
seroconverted du ring the study  will be individually  reported and

discussed.
Evidence of an y possible immunogenicit y will be assessed in the 
adult subjects by  assay ing for generation of antibodies to 
fibrinogen b y using a stepwise approach starting with a functional 
screen ing assay  to detect neutralizing activit y. In the event 
neutralizing activity is detected, samples will be further assessed 
by a confirmatory  ELISA for the presence of antibodies to 
fibrinogen.

2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATION AL PRODUCT
The following investigational product will be used in this c linical trial:
Table 2-1Investigational product
INVESTIGA TIONA L PRODUCT 
FIB GrifolsSeparate primary  conditioning materials for l yophilized powder and solvent:
-Vials containing 1.0 g of human FIB Grifols ( powder for infusion)
-Vials containing 50 mL of sterile water for injection (solvent)
FIBGrifols is a l yophilized and sterile preparation of fibrinogen highly  purified from 
human plasma, subjected to three specific pathogen elimination steps (solvent/det ergent, 
nanofiltration, and heat treatment) during its purification performed b y Instituto Grifols, 
S.A. (Barcelona, Spain). FIB Grifols has not been tested in human subjects.
2.2 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS FROM NONCLINICAL STU DIES AND 
CLINICAL TRIALS THAT ARE RELEVA NT TO THE TRIAL
All nonclinical data related to efficacy  and safety  of FIB Grifols is summarized in Human 
Plasma -derived Intravenous Fibrinogen Grifols Investigator’s Brochure [1].
Regarding clinical data, the present clinical trial will constitute the first use of this pr
oduct 
in human subjects.

                                                Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0     Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 29of 103
2.3 SUMMARY OF THE KNOWN AND POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS 
TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
Intended benefit of fibrinogen concentrates is to avoid hemorrhagic manifestations in 
subjects w ith fibrinogen deficiencies. Already  licensed products are indicated for treatment 
of acute bleeding episodes and as replacement therapy  in subjects with congenital 
deficiency  of fibrinogen and bleeding tendency , for peri -operative proph ylaxis and before 
or during pregnancy  and obstetrics .[2, 3, 4]
Fibrinogen concentrates are also indicated [5]as complementary  therapy  to management of 
life threatening bleeding in cases of acquired h ypofibrinogenaemia, eg:
1.Increased consumption of fibrinogen associated with otherwise uncontrolled life 
threatening bleeding in obstetric complica tions
2.Dilutional hy pofibrinogenemia in, for example, trauma -patients with severe blood 
loss after massive replacement therap y with colloid and cry stalloid solutions
3.Disorders of s ynthesis of coagulation factors –eg,severe liver parench yma damage 
with fib
rinogen deficiency
4.Increased consumption of fibrinogen associated with otherwise uncontrolled life 
threatening bleeding due to disseminated intravascular coagulation s yndrome and 
hyperfibrinol ysis
Potential risks associated with the use of other fibrinoge n products in the market include but 
are not limited to: thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary  embolism 
(PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and arterial thrombosis and allergic -anaphy lactic 
reactions . [2, 3, 4, 5]
Thrombotic events may  occur spontaneously  in subjects with congenital deficiency  with or 
without the use of fibrinogen replacement therap y. Thrombotic events have been reported in 
subjects treated with fibrinogen concentrates. Subjects receiving fibrinogen concentrates 
should be closely  monitored for signs and s ymptoms of thrombosis.
Since FIB Grifols and ot
her licensed fibrinogen concentrates are prepared from human 
plasma, infectious diseases due to transmission of infective agents cannot be totally  
excluded. This also applies to pathogens of unknown nature. In the case of FIB Grifols, the 
risk of transmission of infective agents is, however, reduced b y: 1) selection of donors b y a 
medical interview and screening of individual donations and plasma pools for hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV), 2) testing of plasma pools for HCV genomic material, and 3) 
inactivation/removal procedures included in the production process that have been validated 
using model viruses. These procedures are considered effective for HIV, HCV, hepatitis A
virus (HAV), parvovirus B19 (B19), and hepatit is B virus (HBV ). [1]As with all products 
containing human origin proteins, allergic reactions may  occur. S ymptoms of allergic or 
early signs of h ypersensitivity  reactions include hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the 
chest, wheezing and h ypotension. More serious hy persensitivity  reactions cannot be ruled 
out, including anaph ylactic shock, in the product administration, especially  when immune 
globulin A (I
gA) deficient subjects who present antibodies against IgA are administered. 
Fibrinogen concentrates should not be administered in subjects with selective IgA 
deficiency  and who have antibodies against IgA or in subjects with known marked 
                                                Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0     Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 30of 103
hypersensitivity  to the active substance or to an y of the excipients contained in the product, 
described in FIB Grifols Investigator’s Brochure [1].
In the case of replacement therap y with coagulation factors in other congenital deficiencies, 
antibody  reactions have been observed, but there is currentl y no data with fibrinogen.
Other adverse reactions reported after treatment with fibrinogen
 concentrates are 
generalized reactions such as chills, fever, nausea and vomiting [2].
2.4
DESCRIPTION OF AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ROUTE 
ADMINISTRATION, DOSA GE, DOSAGE REGIMEN, 
AND TREATMENT 
PERIOD(S)
In order to exert its hemostatic properties, fibrinogen must be present intravascularl y,
therefore the product is to be administered b y slo w intravenous infusion. The dose to be 
administered in the study (single -dose intravenous infusion of FIB Grifols at a dosage of 
70mg/kg of bod y weight) is deemed sufficient to reach the generall y accepted minimum 
threshold for hemostasis in subjects with congenital deficiency  of not less than 1g of 
fibrinogen per liter [6].
The usual dosage and dosage regimen of chronic replacement ther
apy (prophy laxis in 
subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency  and bleeding tendency) with human 
fibrinogen has not been yet clearl y established. [5]
In this stud y, the rate of infusion is to be controlled by means of an infu
sion pump. Delivery 
will be performed at a rate not higher than 5 mL/minute (it is acceptable to titrate up to this 
rate at the investigator’s discretion). If an advers e event (AE) occurs during the infusion, 
the infusion rate may  be reduced or the infusion interrupted until sy mptoms subside. 
Subsequently , the infusion may  be resumed at a rate tolerated by  the subject, but not 
exceeding 5 mL/minute. All subjects will be monitored at different time points after the 
infusion ends for an y signs of AE.
2.5 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROTOCOL, GOOD CLINICAL PRA CTICE 
AND THE APPLICABLE REGUL ATORY REQUIREMENTS
This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origins in the Declaration of Helsinki of the 18thWorld Medical Assembly, June 1964, and 
consecutive updates, in compliance with the approved protocol of the stud y, with any 
approved amendment of the protocol, in compliance with Internatio nal Conference on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practices (ICH GCP, Topic E6), and in compliance with 
other applicable regulatory  requirements. 
2.6 DESCRIPTION OF THE P OPULATION TO BE STUD IED
Study  population will be made up of adult and pediatric subjects with asymptomatic (non -
bleeding) congenital fibrinogen deficiency  (afibrinogenemia).
                                                Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0     Dated 08 Oct 2018

2.7 REFERENCE TO LITERAT URE AND DAT A THAT ARE RELEVANT TO
THE TRIAL AND THAT P ROVIDE BACKGROUND FO R THE TRIAL
Human fibrinogen (factor I) is a soluble plasma glycoprotein with a m olecular weight of 
330-340 kDa. The molecule is a hexamer containing two sets of three different chains (Aα, 
Bβ, γ) 2with three parent chains, α, β and γ, and fibrinopeptide A and fibrino
peptide B, 
respectivel y. Both fibrinopeptides are cleaved from fibrinogen b y thrombin. [7, 8]
Fibrinogen is s ynthesized by hepatocytes in the liver [
9]and is essential for hemostasis, 
wound healing, fibrinol ysis, inflammation, angiogenesis, cellular and matrix interacti
ons, 
and neo plasia. These processes involve the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and often the 
interaction of fibrinogen with various proteins and cells. Normal plasma levels are about 
2.5 g fibrinogen/L  of blood, however, concentrations of fibrinogen can increase by as much 
as 200- 400% during times of phy siological stress (primarily  due to the actions of 
macrophage -derived interleukin -6, an acute phase reactant).
When fibrinopeptides A and B are cleaved from fibrinogen b y thrombin, fibrin monomers 
are formed. The f ormed soluble fibrin monomers poly merize forming protofibrils. When 
protofibrils reach a sufficient length (usually  about 600 -800 nm), they  aggregate laterally  
forming fibers. The fibrin clot is formed by  branching of the fibers. [ 7] 
Initiall y, the fibrin pol ymers are linked b y hydrogen and electrostatic bonds and the 
structure (unstable or non
-intercrossed clot) is easily  dissolved by  chaotropic agents such as 
5M urea and proteol ytic enzy mes such as plasmin. The transglutaminase , activated factor 
XIII (FXIIIa), covalently binds specific glutamine residues in one fibrin molecule to ly sine 
residues in another via isopeptide bonds, and covalent links are formed between the C -
terminal of the γ -chains. Thus, fibrin poly mers are formed . Stable or intercrossed clots are 
formed when the fibrin mesh is covalently  linked. This intercrossing of the fibrin poly mers 
delay s proteol ytic degradation of the meshed clot, reinforces its mechanical properties, and 
the clot is stabilized against mechanical, chemical, and proteol ytic insults. [7]
The concentration of fibrinogen circulating in normal plasma ranges from
 2.0 to 4.5 g/L 
however, in subjects with various congenital or acquired conditions, the levels of clottable 
fibrinogen are markedly  reduced or undetectable. Conditions of congeni tal fibrinogen 
deficiency  include afibrinogenemia (complete absence or extremely  low levels of plasma 
fibrinogen), h ypofibrinogenemia (reduced concentration (<150 mg/dL) of structurall y 
normal plasma fibrinogen), and d ysfibrinogenemia (normal plasma levels of abnormal or 
dysfunctional fibrinogen molecules). Qualitative and quantitative abnormalities can also co-
exist as hy pody sfibrinogenemia .[10, 11, 12]
Congenital afibrinogenemia is a rare coagulation disorder usual
ly with an autosomal 
recessive mode of inheritance. According to the literature, in the Western countries its 
prevalence is estimated to be 1 subject per million people. In countries or regions with 
higher rates of consanguinity , this numbers may  be increased. It is characterized by  
moderate to severe bleeding manifestations that often start at birth with uncontrolled 
umbilical cord hemorrhages. Bleeding may  occur spontaneously  or after minor trauma or 
small surgical intervention, into skin, mucosa, muscles, gastrointestinal tract or the central 
nervous s ystem, with intracranial hemorrhage be ing the major cause of death.[10, 11, 13, 
14, 15] Spontaneous spleen rupture has been also reported . [16] Affected women usually  
have menorrhagia and pregnancy  is also frequently  interrupted during the first trimester due 
                                                Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0     Dated 08 Oct 2018

to the lack of proper stabilization of placental- maternal attachment b y fibrinogen. [17, 18, 
19, 20] In some cases, paradoxical arterial and venous thromboembolic com plications may  
occur. [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] Typical laboratory  findings in subjects with congenital 
afibrinogenemia include prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partia
l thromboplastin time, 
thrombin time (TT), and reptilase time. Mutations leading to congenital afibrinogenemia 
have been discovered in all three fibrinogen chains although the majorit y of subjects seem 
to have mutations in the Aα gene. [26, 27, 28, 29]
Clinical sy mptoms of hypofibrinogenemia are usually  milder compared with 
afibrinogenemia, and the condition is freque ntly combined with a dy sfibrinogenemia that is 
characterized with an abnormal fibrinogen variant (hy pody sfibrinogenemia). Several 
missense mutations in the three fibrinogen genes have been identified as the cause of 
dysfibrinogenemia and hy pofibrinogenemia that lead to abnormal gene expression resulting 
in the decreased fibrinogen concentration or d ysfunctional fibrinogen molecules. [
6, 12]
Subjects with any  of these conditions are treated for bleeding either by  substitution with a 
fibrinogen concentrate in countries where it is available, with
 cryoprecipitate (Cohn I 
fraction) or with fr esh frozen plasma. [6, 10, 30]
Theoretically , fibrinogen concentrates would be the preferred option because
 of 
demonst rated and potential advantages when compared with cry oprecipitate and plasma in 
terms of safet y, efficacy , access to timely  intervention, and precise dosing.
Potential disadvantages associated with the use of cry oprecipitate and plasma would be:
1.Immune rea ctions including but not limited to allergic reactions, 
anaph ylactic/anaph ylactoid reactions, intravascular hemoly sis and transfusion-
related acute lung injury  (TRALI)
2.Fluid overload due to the amount of volume needed for achieving required 
fibrinogen leve ls
3.Viral infection risks due to the lack of viral inactivation/removal steps
4.Precise dosing not feasible due to the lack of precise fibrinogen content and volume 
measurement
5.Preparation time as these products must be thawed, pooled and eventually  ABO 
blood type matched prior to infusion.
Due to the low prevalence of this disease, there is an absolute lack of adequately  well-
designed, controlled studies in subjects with active bleeding and the onl y available data on 
fibrinogen concentrates’ efficacy  come fro m anecdotal case reports and retrospective 
studies and survey s. [13, 16, 19, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] From these studies it can 
be concluded that the clinical efficacy  of fibrinogen concentrates in achievi ng hemostasis in 
activel y bleeding subjects and subjects at high risk situations (eg ,undergoing surgery ) is 
adequate and equivalent to those achieved b y subjects treated with cry oprecipitate. 
To date, the adequate prophy lactic regimen to treat subjects w ith congenital deficiency  and 
severe life -threatening bleeding tendency  has not been y et clearl y established and its 
efficacy  remains controversial, although positive trends have been repo
rted from 
retrospective studies and case reports. [6, 13, 18, 36]

CONFIDENTIAL Page 33of 103
Other clinical trials have studied the safet y, pharmacokinetics and pharma cody namics of 
fibrinogen concentrates in congenitally  deficient subjects. [2, 40, 41] These studies showed 
a good corr elation between fibrinogen levels determined by  functional (Clauss) and antigen 
methods and confirmed previous data indicating a terminal half -life (t 1/2)of 3.0 to 5.3 days. 
For other PK parameters (volume of distribution [Vd], clearance [Cl], incremental in vivo 
recovery  [IVR]), larger differences were found depending on the product used, reporting in 
vivo recoveries of 94% in one case and 54% in the other and 2 -3 fold differences in Vd and 
Cl. For the same parameters, large differences (2 -fold) were also found in terms of 
between -subject variability .
In all cases, fibrinogen capacit y for restoring normal hemostasis was demonstrated b y 
normalization of previously  abnormal (prolonged) standard coagulation tests: TT, PT, and 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values.
Hemostatic efficacy  of treatment with fibrinogen concentrates has also been evaluated both 
in vitro and in vivo as well as in clinical studies in congenital and acquired fibrinogen 
deficiency . [42, 43, 44, 45 , 46, 47, 48] Many  of these studies have used pre -infusion and 
post-infusion rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters, mainly  maximum clot 
firmness (MCF) to demonstrate hemostatic efficacy. MCF is highl y depend ent on the 
concentration and activity of platelets and fibrinogen and is considered a functional 
marker/surrogate endpoint indicative of a subject’s hemostatic competency. Many studies 
and papers have evaluated the correlation of thromboelastographic param eters with clinical 
bleeding occurrence and support the increasing use of this device for bedside monitoring of 
high-risk subjects in order to provide guidance for use of blood components and hemostatic 
products administration. [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 , 56, 57, 58]
From these studies, as well as from years of clinical experience in the use of fibrinogen 
concentrates, it has been demonstrated that fibrinogen infusions were well tolerated and 
fibrinogen concentrates have a good safet y profile.
The biggest concern with the use of this kind of product in subj ects with congenital 
afibrinogenemia is the risk of 
thrombotic events. The occurrence of arterial and venous 
thromboembolism in this population with or without the use of fibrinogen- containing 
products has been extensively  reported in the literature. [13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 59, 60]
It has been speculated that in subjects lacking fibrinogen but 
with the hemostatic sy stem 
otherwise intact, platelet aggregation can occur. Interestingl y, a study performed on mice 
lacking fibrinogen demonstrated that clots rich in platelets and von Willebrand factor were 
formed with no differences with respect to wild t ype mice in platelet deposition or 
thrombus initiation phases. However, during the propagation phase, where fibrinogen is 
supposed to exert its function, growing clots did not resist shear stress and were stripped off 
and carried away  causing downstream fr om the injury  site embolization. [61]
Equally , thrombin generation is not disturbed in subjects suffering from isolated fibrinogen 
deficiency  and the lack of fibrinogen to sequester the formed thrombin molecule s into the 
fibrin (antithrombin I) clots would then cause elevated levels of circulating thrombin. In 
this regard, some studies and case reports have indicated that fibrinogen deficient subjects 
have increased levels of some markers of activation of coagul ation as prothrombin 
activation fragments or thrombin- antithrombin complexes. This baseline overcoming of 
natural anticoagulation proteins as antithrombin III (ATIII) could explain the apparent 
reported lack of efficacy  of heparins for prevention of thrombotic events in subjects with 
                                                Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0     Dated 08 Oct 2018

fibrinogen congenital deficiency  and the success when switching to treatment with direct 
thrombin inhibitors. [62, 63]
Due to the high frequency  of fibrinogen -deficient subjects that suffer from life -threatening 
haemorr hagic events and the confines of having only  a few approved products in the 
marketplace, Grifols has planned a clinical development program for FIB Grifols in 
subjects with congenital afibrinogenemia. The present study  designed to obtain PK, safet y, 
and hemostatic efficacy  data is the first trial of the clinical program.
3. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES
1. To evaluate the PK profile of FIB Grifols following single- dose administrat ion of 70 
mg/kg bod y weight.
2.To evaluate hemostatic efficacy  of FIB Grifols b y means of thromboelastographic 
MCF values’ comparison at baseline and one hour after investigational product 
administration. Other thromboelastographic measures as well as standa rd 
coagulation tests measured at different time points will also serve as secondary   
 efficacy  endpoints.
3.To evaluate the safet y of FIB Grifols. Clinical safety , virus safet y, and 
immunogenicit y will be assessed in this clinical trial. Safety variables include AEs, 
vital signs, phy sical assessments, laboratory  tests, viral markers, and antibodies 
against human fibrinogen.

Subjects will be informed of the voluntary  nature of participation, and of the 
right to withdraw from the study  at any  time, without this imply ing an y negative 
consequences for the subject. 
Subjects will receive a Patient Information Sheet to take at home and they  will 
be given enough t ime to think about their clinical trial participation.
Investigator will make sure that potential subjects fully understand the elements 
of the Patient Information Sheet . 
2.Clinical Trial I nformed Consent: 
Before an y stud y-specific screening procedures wi ll be performed, and after 
completely  understanding the nature of the clinical trial, potential subjects or their 
parents or legal guardian for those subjects not qualified to give legal consent, must 
sign and date a Clinical Trial Informed Consent . The investigator will also sign and 
date it, thus reflecting that Clinical Trial Informed Consent has been obtained, and 
that the subject has had the opportunity  to ask questions, and has received adequate 
answers. The subject will receive a signed copy of the i nformed consent form (I CF) 
and the original will be filed along with the study  documentation.

11.Fibrinogen levels: Plasma samples will be obtained for measurement of fibrinogen
levels at those sites that cannot perform fibrinogen levels determinations by two 
methods: fibrinogen activity  (Clauss method) and fibrinogen antigen locally . In 
these cases the subject will have a blood sample taken at Screen ing Visit and have it 
analyzed for this parameter by  both methods at the central laboratory  of the study  
for verification of the eligibility  against the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. I n these 
cases, sample sfor the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria assessment w ill not be taken at

4.7 PREMATURE DISCONTINU ATION OF PARTICIPATI NG SUB JECTS 
Study  participation is strictly  voluntary . Study  subjects have the right to withdraw from the 
study  at an y time for an y reason. Likewise the investigator can withdraw a subject from the 
clinical trial at an y time if it is deemed in the subject’s bes t interest
In an y case, the investigator must document the reason(s) for withdrawal of each subject in 
the medical history  and in the CRF/eCRF. Moreover, after subject’s withdrawal it is 
suggested to perform a last visit as soon as possible so that all stu dy-related information can 
be recorded. The sponsor will have access to all data gathered on subjects prior to 
termination.
Since premature discontinuations could lead to missing data, it will be possible to substitute 
certain discontinued subjects for new ones in order to get number of evaluable subjects. 
These substitutions will be only  allowed when premature discontinuations happen before 
the infusion of investigational product during the enrolment period. 
Subject withdrawal criteria and procedures are described in Section 5.3.
4.8 ACCOUNTABILITY PROCE DURES FOR THE INVEST IGATIONAL 
PRODUCT
The investigational site must keep accurate drug accountability  records. These will include:

product was dispensed; 3) when and how much investigational product was administered to 
each stud y subject. 
In addition, reasons for deviations from the
expected dispensing/administration regimen 
must a lso be recorded.

All study  medication will be reconciled before completion of the clinical trial within each 
clinical site.
4.9 SOURCE DATA
All information contained in the medical history , complementary  exploration reports 
including laboratory  test will be c onsidered as clinical trial source data.
Any data entered in the CRF/eCRF should have written or electronic record in the subject’s 
medical record s. These written or electronic records will be considered source data and 
should be dated and signed by  the in vestigator or by  the qualified delegated person (eg, 
results of phy sical examinations, vital signs testing, or the investigational product 
administration procedure).
For every  single subject enrolled, the investigator will write into his/her medical histor y 
that he/she has been enrolled in a clinical trial, specify ing its title, study  number and 
sponsor (Instituto Grifols, S.A.), as well as the inclusion date.
The investigator is responsible for maintaining complete and adequate case histories in 
source rec ords of each subject. All study -specific data necessary  to be recorded in the 
CRF/eCRF that cannot be found in subject’s past medical record s(such as medical history , 
past medications, etc ,to be recorded at screening visit) should be record edby the 
investigator or its designee in subject’s medical file, dating and signing all new entries.
Source data must be preserved for the maximum period of time permitted by local 
regulations and made available by  the investigator in the cases described above.

AEs will be elicited b y spontaneous reporting b y the study  subject or b y a non -leading 
inquiry  or direct observation by  the study  staff.
8.2.2 VITAL SIGNS
During the infusion and at different time points throughout the stud y, vital signs will be 
monitored by  the investigator or by  quali fied staff. 
Clinically  relevant vital signs (T, BP, HR, RR) abnormalities will be reported as AEs. 
A vital sign will be considered clinically  relevant if it represents a change from the baseline 
value that meets the following criteria:
1. HR i ncrease or dec rease of ≥30 bpm
2. SBP increase or decrease of ≥30 mm Hg
3. DBP inc rease or decreas e of ≥30 mm Hg
4. T change of ≥1ºC
8.2.3 PHYSI CAL ASSESSMENT
A phy sical assessment by  body  systems will be performed at different time points 
throughout the stud yby the investigator or a medical doctor designated sub -investigator . 
The investigator will be required to classify  the phy sical finding abnormalities as clinicall y 
relevant or not according to his/her judgment. Results will be recorded in the source 
documents and on the subject’s CRF/eCRF. Phy sical assessments abnormalities judged by  
the investigator as clinically  relevant will be considered AEs.
8.2.4 LABORATORY PANELS
Laboratory  tests will include:
1.Serum clinical chemistry: including creatinine, BUN, ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, TB, 
glucose, s odium, potassium, chloride and calcium.
                                                   Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0    Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 83of 103
2. Hematological parameters: CBC, including platelet count and differential leukocy te 
count. 
3. Markers of activation of coagulation: different measures indicative of activation in the 
coagulation pathway  (D-dimer, ATIII, TAT, F 1+2).
Blood specimens for laboratory  tests will be collected at different time points throughout 
the study . Laboratory  tests results will be collected in the corresponding CRF/eCRF entry . 
Abnormal (out of range) results will be flagged b y the report ing laboratory . The 
investigator will be required to indicate the clinical relevance of out of range (abnormal) 
results. Laboratory  results out of the normal range judged by  the investigator as clinicall y 
relevant will be considered AEs. 
In the case of ma rkers of activation of c oagulation, their relationship with plasma 
fibrinogen levels pre- and post -infusion will be studied. 
In case of pediatric sampling, pediatric tubes would be provided to reduce the amount of 
blood drawn for lab works, including the complete elimination of virology ,
immunogenicit y, and markers of activation of coagulation lab works. Pediatric subjects will 
not undergo Month 3 virology  and immunogenicity  follow -up visits, and their participation 
in the study  will finish at the Week 4 V isit. Pediatric subjects weighing less than 30 kg will 
also have a n even more reduced blood sampling schedule as detailed in Table 4-4and 
Table 4-5:
-Day 0 - baseline (including the retention sample)
-Day 0 -1 hour post -infusion
-Day 0 -8 hours post -infusion
-Day 1 -24 hours post -infusion
-Day 4 -96 hours post -infusion
-Day 6
-144 hours post -infusion and
-Day 9 -216 hours post -infusion
8.2.5
ANTIBODIES AGAINST F IBRINOGEN DETERMI NAT ION 
(IMMUNOGENICITY TESTI NG)
Evidence of an y possible immunogenicit y of the investigational product will be assessed at 
the sponsor’s laboratory . Samples from adult sub jects will be assay ed for the generation of 
antibodies to fibrinogen by  using a stepwise approach starting with a functional screening 
assay  to detect neutralizing activity . In the event neutralizing activit y is detected, samples 
will be further assessed b y a confirmatory  ELISA for the presence of antibodies to 
fibrinogen.
If a confirmed, single case of immunogenicity  is reported after a subject has been dosed 
with study  drug, an y further enrollment and dosing of subjects in the study  will be 
suspended unti l the event can be adequately  assessed by  the safety  group of the sponsor. 
The enrollment and dosing will only  resume after explicit authorization by  the sponsor. 
                                                   Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0    Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 84of 103
8.2.6 MONITORING OF ALLERG IC/HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS   
Subjects will be carefully monitored by  the investigator or study  staff for signs and 
symptoms of allergic/h ypersensitivity  reactions occurring between the Baseline Visit and 
the Week 4 Visit. The Grifols Medical Monitor will routinely  review reported AEs for 
possible allergic/hy persensitivity  reactions according to the algorithm described in 
Annex 2.
8.2.7 MONITORING OF THROMB OTIC EVENTS
Subjects will be monitored by  the investigator and/or study  staff for signs and sy mptoms of 
arterial and venous thromboses occurring between the Baseline Visit and th e Week 4 Visit. 
The algorithm sdescribed in Annex 1 , which 
include the Wells S core assessment , will be 
observed for evaluation and assessment of thrombotic events risk. In addition, the Grifols 
Medical Monitor will routinely  review reported AEs for possibl e thromboses. Arterial and 
venous thromboses will be identified according to definitions in the I nternational 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD -9-CM [66]). Such 
thrombotic events include, but are not limited to, DVT, PE, myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular accident, acute coronary  syndrome, limb thrombosis, sagital sinus 
thrombosis, and portal vein or mesenteric artery  thrombosis. All thromboses wi ll be 
recorded as AEs and reported accordingl y. 
If a confirmed single case of thrombosis is reported after a subject has been dosed with 
study  drug, an y further enrollment and dosing of subjects in the study  will be suspended 
until the event can be adequa tely assessed by  the safet y group of the sponsor. The 
enrollment and dosing will only  resume after explicit authorization by  the sponsor. 
8.2.8 VIROL OGY TESTING
Viral monitoring for each adult subject will be performed b y mean of serology  and nucleic 
acid ampli fication technology  tests. 
Serum /plasma samples from all subjects will be drawn at baseline (prior to the scheduled 
infusion). An additional aliquot of serum /plasma will be retained from all viral time points 
for re -testing if necessary.
During follow -
up, viral monitoring will be limited to those subjects and viruses where all 
previous tests were non -reactive (negative) for the target virus at baseline (prior to the 
infusion of the investigational medicinal product) and previous visits. If there is a posit ive 
virology  test result at baseline, laboratory  testing for this particular virus will no longer be 
performed during the course of the clinical trial. 
If there is a change from baseline (prior to the infusion of the investigational medicinal 
product) vir al status during clinical trial, it must be confirmed b y repeating the virology  
test, using the same technique and/or other techniques as deemed appropriate by  the 
sponsor (eg ,more sensitive techniques), such as nucleic acid amplification technology  tests . 
Moreover, if considered necessary  by the sponsor, re-analysis of any  sample could be 
ordered , including storage samples, by  an independent laboratory .
                                                   Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0    Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 85of 103
8.3 PROCEDURES FOR ELICI TING REPORTS OF AND FOR RECORDING 
AND REPORTING ADVERSE EVENT AND INTERCUR RENT ILLN ESSES
8.3.1 ADVERSE EVENT 
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product or stud y treatment and which does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with this administration. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an y abnormal laboratory  findings, for instance), s ymptoms, 
or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product or study  treatment, 
whether or not considered related to t he medicinal product or stud y treatment. 
Any AE that occurs at any  time between signature of the informed consent and last day  of 
the subject’s participation in the clinical safet y period of the study (Week 4 Visit) must be 
reported on the AE CRF/eCRF ent ry.
8.3.2 CAUSALITY OF ADVERSE EVENT 
The investigator will be asked to assess the causal relationship of the AE to the study  
treatment according to the following classification based on Karch FE et al [64]:
-Definite : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from admin
istration of 
the treatment or in which the treatment level has been established in bod y fluids or 
tissues; that follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; and that is 
confir med b y improvement on stopping the treatment (dechallenge), and reappearance of 
the event on repeated exposure (rechallenge).
-Probable: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the treatment; that follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; that is 
confirmed b y dechallenge; and that could not be reasonabl y explained b y the known 
characteristics of the subject’s clinical state. 
-Possible: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administrat ion of 
the treatment; that follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; but that 
could have been produced by  the subject’s clinical state or other modes of therap y 
administered to the subject. 
-Doubtful/Unlikely: An event that follows a rea sonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the treatment; that does not follow a known response pattern to the 
suspected treatment; but that could not be reasonably  explained by  the known 
characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
-Unrelated: Anyevent that does not meet the criteria above.
The operational tool to decide the AE causal relationship is based on algorithms by  Karch-
Lasagna and Naranjo [64, 65].
When an AE is classified, assessing causal relationship by  the investigator, as definitive, 
probable, possible, or doubtful/unlikely , the event will be defined as suspected adverse drug 
                                                   Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0    Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 86of 103
reaction (ADR ). When the causal relationship is labeled “Unrelated”, then it will be 
considered that the AE is not imputable to the study treatment and it is not an ADR. 
Any AE experienced by  the subject prior to the investigational product infusion on Day  0 
will be l abeled as Unrelated to the investigational medicinal product.
8.3.3 SUSPECTED ADVERSE DR UG REACTION  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product or study  treatment related to 
any dose should be considered a suspected ADR. The phrase “responses t o a medicinal 
product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product or study  treatment 
and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility , that is, the relationship cannot be ruled out. In 
the framework of this study , a suspected ADR with a cau sal relationship of “definite” will 
be named as Adverse Reaction. Adverse reactions are a subset of suspected ADR.   
The sponsor is responsible for assessing the suspected ADR expectedness during the 
clinical trial.
8.3.4 SEVERI TY OF ADVERSE EVENT OR SUSPECTED ADVERSE DRUG 
REACTI ON
AE and suspected ADR will be classified depending on their severit y (intensity ) according 
to the following definition:
1.Mild: awareness of sign or sy mptom, but easil y tolerated (acceptable)
2.Moderate: discomfort to interfere with usual activity  (disturbing)
3.Severe: incapacit y to work or to do usual activity (unacceptable)
AE and suspected ADR severit y (intensity) gradation must be distinguished from AE and 
suspected ADR seriousness gradation, which is defined according to event consequen ce. 
For example, a headache could be mild, moderate or severe but unusually  is serious in all 
these cases.
The investigator will be responsible for assessing the AE or suspected ADR severit y 
(intensity ) during the clinical trial, taking into account curren tly criteria detailed in this 
section.
8.3.5 SERI OUS ADVERSE EVEN T
An SAE is an AE or a suspected ADR, occurring at an y dose that fulfils one or more of the 
following:
1.Results in death.
2.Is immediatel y life -threatening (life- threatening in the definition of SAE r efers to an 
event in which the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it were more 
severe).
                                                   Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0    Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 87of 103
3.Requires in-subject hospitalisation or requires prolongation of existing hospitali zation* .
4.Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity .
5.Is a congenital anomal y/ birth defect.
6.Is an important medical event: important medical event in the definition of “serious” 
refers to those events which may  not be immediately  life-threatening, or result in death, 
or hospitalization, but from medical and scientific judgment may  jeopardize the subject 
and/or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above. Examples of suc h events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization. Development of cancer or drug dependency  or drug 
abuse will normally  be considered serious by this criterion.
*Hospitalization is to be considered onl y hospital stay for equal or more than 24 hours. 
The following hospitalizations should not be reported as SAEs:
-Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization needed for procedures required by 
the clinical trial protocol.
-Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization as part of a routine procedure 
followed b y the center.
-Hospitalization for a survey  visit, annual phy sicals, or social reasons.
-Elective (pre -planned) hospitalizations for a pre -existing condition that had not 
worsened from Baseline (eg ,elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to start of 
the study ).
-Admissions not associated with an AE (eg, social hospitalization for purposes of 
respite care).
A distinction should be drawn b etween serious and severe AEs. The term “severe” is used 
to describe the severit y of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relative 
minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, 
which is defined o n subject/event outcome or action criteria usuall y associated with events 
that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severit y) is a medical 
term while severit y is a subjective term. 
According to the medical criteria, an AE, or a suspected ADR, can be classified as serious, 
although it does not fulfill the conditions detailed in this section, if it is considered 
important from a medical point of view. The investigator is responsible for assessing the 
AE, or suspected ADR, seriousness during the clinical trial, taking into account currentl y 
criteria detailed in this section.
8.3.6 COLLECTION AND REPOR TING OF ADVERSE EVEN TS AND SUSPECTED 
ADVERSE DRUG REACTI ONS 
AEs will be collected from the time of the subject´s signature of the Clinica l Trial Informed 
Consent until Week 4 Visit. All reported AEs will be recorded on the AE CRF/eCRF entry. 
                                                   Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0    Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 88of 103
An identical entry  should be also present in the subject’s hospital record. If no AE has 
occurred during the study  period, this should also be indicated in the CRF/eCRF.
At each visit/time point, t he occurrence of AEs will be assessed b y the study staff. If it is 
possible, AEs will be elicited by  asking the subject a non- leading question such as “Do you 
feel different in an y way since the last assessment ?” Moreover, AE will also be collected 
through directl y observed events or spontaneously volunteered b y the subject. Signs 
observed b y the stud y staff should also be considered to elicit AEs especially  when the 
subjects cannot be asked (eg ,the subject is anesthetized). Clearly  related signs, s ymptoms 
and abnormal diagnostic procedures should preferably  be grouped together and recorded as 
a single diagnosis or s yndrome wherever possible. I t is responsibility  of the investigator to 
ensure that AEs are approp riately  recorded.
Infusional AEs (ie, AEs temporally  associated with an infusion of investigational medicinal 
product) will be defined as an y AE occurred during the infusion or within 24 after 
completion of the infusion. For example, it will include an y clinicall y relevant 
abnormalities in vital signs during the infusion, as previously defined. 
Other safety  variables comprise blood laboratory  tests. A clinically  relevant deviation from 
normal/reference laboratory  ranges based on each individual pre -study  (baseline) value (as 
judged b y the investigator) may  also constitute an AE and should be recorded on the AE 
CRF/eCRF entry . Abnormalitites in laboratory  results, vital signs and physical exams 
should not be recorded as AEs if they  are known to be a s ymptom or sign of a s yndrome or 
diagnosis that is also being reported as an AE.  
The following variables must be recorded on the AE CRF/eCRF entry :
1. The verbatim term (a diagnosis is preferred)
2.Date/time of onset
3.Date/time of resolution
4.Severity  (mild , moderate, severe)
5.Causality  (unrelated, doubtful/unlikely ,possible, probable, definite)*
6.Seriousness (y es, no)
7. Action ta ken (with regard to study  drug)
8.Other action (to treat the event)
9.Outco me and sequel (follow -up on AE)
* Causality assessment will be only made w hen the AE occurs after the subject has been 
administered the investigational product (at any dose). AE occurring before subject's 
exposure to study treatment will be always labeled as "Unrelated".
In addition to the investigator’s own description of the A Es, each AE will be encoded by  
the sponsor or designated (eg, contract research organization [CRO]) according to the 
Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA®) dictionary  of medical codes.
A pregnancy  not verified before enrollment but occurrin g during the course of the study  
will not be considered an AE, unless a causal relationship to the study  drug is at least 
suspected. In an y case, a Pregnancy Report Form must be completed and sent within 24 
                                                   Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0    Dated 08 Oct 2018

For AEs temporally  associated to the infusion, listings of AEs will be presented. AEs will 
be also split between AEs occurring during the infusion or after the infusion completion but 
within 24 and 72 hours after completion of the infusion. For an AE that occurs during an 
infusion, the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the AE, the time the AE is first 
reported and the time the AE changes materiall y in intensity  and/or resolves are a ll to be 
reported and tabulated.
Subjects who die, report a serious AE (SAE), or withdraw from the stud y because of AEs 
will be also individually  listed and summarized. 
AEs will be coded according to the AEs classification of the MedDRA, and will be 
descr ibed b y a synon ym (Preferred Term) and the affected organ / sy stem, the intensity ,

9.1.5 TIMING OF PLANNED IN TERIM ANALYS IS
An interim safet y analysis will be performed with the adult population in order to assess the 
safet y of FIB Grifols pr ior to starting enrollment of pediatric subjects. PK and efficacy  
interim analyses of the investigational medicinal product may  also be performed in the 
adult population. 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMIN ATION
The sample size in this study  is based on the PK assessment. The sample size of 10 adult 
subjects was selected to establish a PK profile of the investigational product. I n order to 
allow for possible drop -outs, 11 adult subjects will be enrolled in the study . 
Only  after the safet y of the product has been assesse d and established in the adult subjects 
population, will 10 pediatric subjects be enrolled into the study . Assuming a 10% dropout 
rate, a total of 11 pediatric subjects need to be enrolled.
9.3 LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests will be two -sided, for which an alpha level of 
0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance.
9.4 CRITERIA FOR THE TER MINATION OF THE TRIA L
Not anticipated.
9.5 PROCEDURES FOR ACCOU NTING FOR MISSING, UNUSED, AND 
SPURIOUS DATA
For the PK anal ysis, any  missing or not valid values for fibrinogen concentration will be 
treated as missing, or if necessary , will be interpolated or extrapolated using PK principle, 
as appropriate, and will be documented in the clinical study  report.
For primary  efficacy endpoint analy sis, the missing value in change from baseline in MCF 
will be set to zero.
9.6 PROCEDURES FOR REPOR TING ANY DEVIATION F ROM THE 
ORIGINAL STATISTICAL PLAN
In case of an y deviations from the original statistical plan, these will be documented in th e 
final study  report.
9.7 SELECTION OF SUBJECTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSES

9.7.2 POPUL ATION FOR STATI STICAL  ANALYS IS OF E FFICACY
Two study  populations for statistical anal ysis of efficacy  will be used: e valuable population 
and PP population. All efficacy  anal ysis will be primarily  run on the evaluable population 
and then they  will be also run on PP. 
Definition of evaluable population: 
The evaluable population will include all subjects who received inves tigational product at 
any amount and who have at least two measurements for the primary  efficacy  variable: one 
pre-infusion MCF and 1- hour post -infus ion MCF measurements b y ROTEM. 
Definition of PP: 
The PP population will include all subjects who received planned dose of the 
investigational product ( at least 90% of the planned dose), who have no major protocol 
violation (to be defined in a data review meeting prior to database lock), and who have at 
least two measurements for the primary  efficacy  variable: one baseline (pre -infusion) MCF 
measurement b y ROTEM and 1-hour post -infusion MCF measurement by ROTEM for the 
investigational medicinal product.
9.7.3 POPUL ATION FOR STATI STICAL  ANALYS IS OF S AFETY
All subjects who receive infusion (at an y dose) of the investig ational product will be 
included in the safet y population. 
10. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, sponsor audits, Institutional Review 
Board’s (IRB) review and health authorities’ inspection(s), provi ding direct access to 
source data and documents. A person designated by  the sponsor will monitor the study  to 
ensure that all required documentation is available, and that collected data on the 
CRF/eCRF precisel y reflect data on source documents. Access to the history and clinical 
course of the stud y subjects by the monitor will be granted. A trial quality assurance audit 
may be conducted at any  time during the course of the study  or after its conclusion at the 
site or vendor.
For each enrolled subject, the investigator or designee will write into the subject’s medical 
history  that he/she is enrolled in this study  sponsored by  Instituto Grifols, S.A., a well as all 
safet y and efficacy information. The investigator is responsible for maintaining complete 
and adequate case histories in source records of each subject. Source data must be 
preserved for the maximum period of time permitted by  local regulations and made 
available b y the investigator in the cases described below.

11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANC E
The present clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the GCP/I CH guidelines. 
Clinical trial monitoring team will sy stematicall y control the clinical trial essential 
documents. All clinical trial phases will be monitored and they  may  be subject ed to internal 
audits by  qualit y assurance (QA). All monitoring visits and internal audits will be followed 
by internal reports and corrective actions, if needed. Follow -up letters will be forwarded to 
sites after all clinical visits.
11.1 QUALITY CONTROL BY T HE CLINICAL TRIAL MO NITORING TEAM
The clinical trial monitoring team will monitor data collected throughout the study . The 
investigator will be available for clinical trial monitors during their visits and will ensure 
that the monitor has access to all doc uments that they  require, including to the subject’s 
files (direct access). The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to make certain 
that any  problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. Subject’s 
anonimity  must be safeguarded and all data checked during these monitoring visits must 
remain confidential.
11.2 QUALITY ASSURANCE BY THE CLINICAL TRIAL A UDIT TEAM
Any study  site or vendor may  be selected for audit at any  moment by  a clinical trial audit 
team, originating from the sponsor or from the external CROs acting on behalf of the 
sponsor.

12. ETHICS
12.1 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS AND ETHICS COMMIT TEE
The ethical standards adopted by  the XVIII World Medical Assembl y (Helsinki, 1964) (and 
subsequent revisions) will be stri ctly observed. The clinical trial likewise will be performed 
in compliance with standards of ICH GCP guideline relating to trials involving 
investigational drugs (I CH Topic E6).
The study  cannot begin until an independent ethics committee (IEC)/IRB and the health 
authorities (when necessary ) have approved the protocol, the informed consent document, 
and the patient information sheets. The investigator will provide the sponsor/CRO with a 
copy  of the communication from the IEC/I RB to the investigator indicati ng approval of the 
protocol and consent form/information sheets before the clinical trial is started. 
The IEC/I RB must be informed of all relevant protocol amendments that may  affect the 
safet y of the participating subjects or conduction of the clinical t rial. All substantial 
amendments to the protocol must be reviewed and approved prior to implementation as 
applicable per local regulations in force, except where necessary  to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazards to human subjects. SAEs, unexpected adverse reactions, and other 
                                                   Protocol I G0902 Version 3.0    Dated 08 Oct 2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 97of 103
relevant information that may  alter the study  design or entail subject risk will be reported to 
the IEC/I RB when required per applicable local regulations. Equall y, protocol deviations 
and violations may  be submitted to I RB according t o the requirements of each of these 
institutions.
The investigator will be responsible for obtaining annual IEC/I RB renewal when applicable 
and submitting SAE reports to the I EC/IRB for the duration of the study  (as per site policies 
and procedures). Copie s of the investigator’s report and/or copies of the IEC/I RB extension 
approval must be made available to the sponsor or designee ( eg,CRO).
12.2 INFORMED CONSENT AND INFORMATION SHEETS
The investigator (or designee) will obtain written informed consent from ea ch subject 
participating in this clinical trial, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study , and prior to initiating an y stud y 
related procedure to a subject. 
For subjects not qualified to give legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the 
parent or legal guardian.  
Each subject will be also informed that his/her source medical records may  be scrutinized 
bythe clinical trial monitor team, the clinical trial audit team, inspectors fr om the health 
authorities or reviewers from the IEC/I RB, in accordance with applicable regulations; that 
the investigator will protect any personal information not related to the study; and that these 
persons are bound b y the same confidentialit y obligatio ns as the subject’s family  doctor. 
The investigator (or designee) will explain that subjects are completel y free to refuse to 
enter into the clinical trial or to withdraw from it at any  time, without any  consequences for 
their further care and without the need for them to justify  their decision. 
After the subject has had time to read the information and feels all their questions have 
been answered, they  will be asked to sign the Clinical Trial Informed Consent . The 
investigator will also sign and date the Clinical Trial Informed Consent , thus reflecting that 
informed consent has been obtained, and that the subject (and his/her representative) has 
had the opportunity  to ask questions, and has received adequate answers. The subject will 
receive a signed copyof the Clinical Trial Informed Consent and of the Patient Information 
Sheet . The original Clinical Trial Informed Consent will be filed along with the study  
documentation.
12.3 CONFIDENTIALITY
All data related to procedures, medications, patents, scientific in formation, and other data 
on materials will be considered confidential, and are sponsor’s propert y. However, the 
study  protocol and other important documents may  be submitted to the IEC/I RB and health 
authorities to obtain approval for conducting the study . 
The investigator will ensure that the subjects’ anony mity will be maintained. Applicable 
privacy  rules will be followed to obtain authorization for most uses and disclosures of 
Protected Health Information. On CRF/eCRFs or other documents submitted to t he sponsor 
or its designee, subjects will not be identified by  their names, but by  a numeric 
identification code. Documents not for submission to I nstituto Grifols, S.A. or its designee,

CONFIDENTIAL Page 98of 103
(eg, the site confidential subject enrolment log and original subject s’ consent forms) will be 
maintained by  the investigator in strict confidence.
The investigator will accept that the sponsor may  use the clinical trial results, including 
CRF/eCRF data, sheets or their copies, or reports with or without comments, and with or 
without analy ses, to submit them to regulatory authorities, and may  reveal them if needed 
to other investigators. To allow use of the information obtained in the clinical trial, the 
investigator will understand that he/she will be obliged to suppl y the sponsor with full 
results of the tests and all the information developed during the study .
13. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING
13.1 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT
The study  data will be recorded and kept current in the CRF/eCRF by  the site study  
personnel directl y responsible for the information. 
The data in the CRF/eCRF will be monitored at the site by  Grifols representatives or 
designee and reviewed for completeness and compared with the available source 
documents. Examples of source documents include individua l subject medical records or 
laboratory  reports, which are separate from the CRF/eCRFs.  
Coding of AEs will be performed automatically by the data management team using the 
MedDRA dictionary . Similarly , coding of all medications will occur using the WHODrug 
dictionary . SAEs will be also coded using MedDRA.
13.2 RECORD KEEPING
The investigator is responsible for maintaining all records pertaining to the clinical trial and 
for ensuring complete and accurate documentation. 
The investigator is responsible for main taining a nominative subject enrollment log. This 
confidential subject identification code provides the link between named subject source 
records in the subject file and anon ymous CRF/eCRF data provided to sponsor.
Essential documents of the study  will be retained by  the investigator according to what is 
established in the I CH GCP (I CH E6), or as per local regulations, whichever is longer. 
No study  documents will be destroy ed without prior written agreement between the 
investigator and Instituto Grifols, S .A. Should the investigator wish to assign the study  
records to another party , or move them to another location, I nstituto Grifols, S.A., must be 
notified in writing.
14. FINANCING AND INSURANCE

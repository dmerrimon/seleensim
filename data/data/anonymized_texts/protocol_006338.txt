  Page 9 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  • The proportion of subjects  with  at least a 2 -grade reduction 
from the Baseline IGA score at Day 14, Day 28 and Day 56, 
and 
• The proportion of subjects  with an IGA score of “clear” or 
“almost clear” at Day 14, Day 28 and D ay 56 and at least a 2 -
grade reduction from the Baseline IGA score.  
• The change from Baseline in the Acne -QoL at Day 84, and  
• Subject’s  assessment of the change in their acne from B aseline 
to Day 84 ( Patient Reporte d Outcome [ PRO ]).     
The safety outcome measures to be assessed are:  
• Adverse events (AEs) reported  from time of consent /assent  
through the end of the study.  
• Complete blood count (CBC), chemistry, and urinalysis 
conducted at Baseline and at Day 84.  
Cutaneous tolerability (erythema, scaling, dryness , pruritus, and 
burning/stinging) will be assessed at the Baseline , Day 14, Day 28, Day 
56 and Day 84 Visits .  Cutaneous tolerability will be  graded using the 
following scale: 0, None; 1, Slight; 2, Moderate; 3, Severe.   
Pregnancy  testing will be c onducted for women of child- bearing 
potential (WOCBP) at the Screening Visit, the Baseline Visit (if > 7 
days from Screening Visit) and at the  Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84  
Visits . 
Total Sample Size:  Subjects  will be randomized 2:2: 2:1:1 (BTX 1503 5% BID:BTX 1503 
5% QD: BTX 1503 2.5% QD: Vehicle BID:Vehicle QD) with 90 
subjects in each BTX 1503 group and 45 subjects in each vehicle group 
for a total of 360 subjects .    
Methods:  Subjects will begin screening to determine eligibility to participate in 
the study. At the Screening Visit, informed consent /assent , medical 
history/review of systems, demographics, height and weight, 
tobacco/alcohol history,  concomitant medications,  and a urine 
pregnancy test ( UPT ) for WOCBP will be obtained.  A  urine drug 
screen (UDS) will be performed.  In addition, lesion counts on the face 
(inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesions counted separately) and 
an IGA will be conducted to assess subject eligibility.  Subjects will be 
12 to 40 years  of age  with mode rate to severe acne vulgaris of the face 
  Page 10 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  (20 to 50 inflammatory lesions , 20 to 100 non -inflammatory lesions, 
and an IGA score of 3 or 4).  
If a subject is deemed eligible, they may be enrolled and begin Baseline 
assessments (within 35 days after the Screen ing Visit).  Assessments 
for safety (CBC, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained at the 
Baseline Visit (Day 1). If the Screening and Baseline Visits are not 
conducted on the same day, lesion counts , IGA, UDS , and a review of 
concomitant medications  will be repeated.  A UPT for WOCBP will be 
repeated if greater than 7 days from the Screening Visit.  Baseline 
photographs of the face (selected sites) will be obtained.  The Acne -
QoL will be administered.  Clinical site staff will apply the first dose of  
study drug.  C utaneous tolerability assessment s will be conducted prior 
to and approximately 15 minutes after the first application . Subjects  
will be given  a diary and  sufficient study drug  to last until their Day 28 
Visit and  instructed in the proper applicat ion to cover their entire face.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 14 for a review of their diary 
to ensure compliance with study drug applications.   Lesion counts, IGA 
and cutaneous tolerability assessments will b e conducted .  In addition, 
the subject  will apply study drug during the visit for the clinical site to 
confirm correct application techniques.  AEs  and concomitant 
medications  will be reviewed.   
Subjects  will return to the clinic on Day 28 and D ay 56 for c utaneous 
tolerability assessments , UPT, lesion counts and IGA.  Subjects will 
also be queried for AEs and changes in concomitant medications.  
Diaries and study drug will be returned and reviewed for compliance.  
In addition, the subject  will apply study drug during the visit for the 
clinical site to confirm correct application techniques.  S tudy drug will 
be dispensed along with the diary for the next 28 days of study drug 
treatment.       
Subjects  will return to the clinic  for their final visit on Day 84 for safety, 
tolerability and efficacy assessments , including lesion counts and IGA 
scoring of facial acne.  Safety labs ( CBC, chemistry, and urinalysis ) and 
a UPT for WOCBP  will be obtained.   Photographs of the face will be 
obtained at selected sites.  Cutaneous tolerability assessments will be 
conducted, and concomitant medications and AEs will be reviewed.  
The Acne- QoL and a patient reported outcome (PRO) will be 
administered at Day 84, assessing the subject’s perception of the change 
  Page 11 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  in their acne rel ative to Baseline.   See Table 3 for full Schedule of 
Assessments.  
Statistical Methods  Analysis Sets : 
This study will be evaluated using 3 analysis sets: intent- to-treat (ITT), 
per protocol (PP), and safety.  Efficacy conclusions will be drawn from 
the ITT analysis set.  The PP analysis set will be used to support the 
efficacy findings in the ITT analyses.   Safety conclusions will be drawn 
from the safety analysis set.  
Demographics will be summariz ed using the safety an alysis dataset by 
age, gender, race, ethnicity , height and weight.  The primary efficacy 
analysis will be conducted on the ITT population using last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) for missing data.  For continuous variables, the 
mean, standard deviatio n (SD), median , and range will be presented 
along with the 95% confidence interval  (CI).   Categorical variables 
will be summariz ed by proportions along with the 95% CI.  
Vehicle QD and Vehicle BID groups may be combined for analyses.  
Handling of Missing Da ta: 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data in the ITT 
analysis set will be based on LOCF .  Other imputation methods (e.g., 
mixed model  for repeat ed measurement  [MMRM] ) may be used as a 
sensitivity analysis.  
All s afety analyses will be  conducted using  the safety analysis set. No 
imputation s will be made for missing safety data.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
The efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT (primary) and 
PP (supportive) analysis sets. The efficacy variables include the IGA 
and lesion counts (inflammatory and non -inflammatory) collected at 
Screening/Baseline and all subsequent study visits.  The primary 
efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in inflammatory lesion count 
at Day 84.   
Absolute and percent changes in lesion counts from Baseline will be 
calculated for each subject at Day 14, Day 28 , Day 56 and Day 84 .  The 
IGA will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” at study Day 14, 
Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 with a subject considered a “success” at 
each individual visit if the IGA at that visit is Clear (“0”) or Almost 
  Page 12 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  Clear (“1”) and at least 2 grades less than the Baseline score.  
Exploratory e fficacy assessments  also include the Acne- QoL which 
will be scored according to the author ’s scoring system (Martin 2001), 
and the subject’s assessment of improvement (PRO) using proportions 
by category.  
Descriptive statistics (including mean, median, standard deviation 
[SD], minimum, and maximum, unless otherwise stated) will be 
presented for the following parameters by study group using both the 
ITT and PP analysis sets:  
• Inflammatory , non- inflammatory , and total lesion counts at 
Baseline, Day 14, Day 28 , Day 56, and Day 84,  
• Absolute and percent change from Baseline in inflammatory , 
non-inflammatory , and total  lesion counts at study Day 14, Day 
28, Day  56, and Day 84,  
• IGA scores and f requency and percent distribution of the 
dichotomized IGA at study  Day 14, Day 28 , Day 56, and Day 
84. 
This Phase 2 study is designed to identify the response to two different 
dosing  frequencies  and two concentrations  of BTX 1503. Statistical 
tests applied to the outcomes will be exploratory .  No adjustments for 
Type 1 error will occur.  
The change from Baseline in lesion counts (inflammatory and non-
inflammatory ; separate and combined , and total ) at Day s 14, 28, 56, 
and 84 will be analyzed us ing ANCOVA with Baseline lesion count  
and treatment  as covariates .  Success on IGA defined as a score of clear 
or almost clear and /or at least a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline at 
Day 14, Day 28 , Day 56, and Day 84 will be analyzed using logistic 
regression, adjusting for Baseline IGA.   
Safety Analyses :  
All subjects  who receiv e at least one confirmed dose of study drug and 
have at least one post -Baseline assessment will be included in the safety 
analyses. Safety analyses will include summaries of treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) , serious AEs (SAEs), and changes in 
laboratory assessments.  TEAEs and SAEs will be summarize d by 
treatment group, the number of subjects  reporting events, system organ 
class, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug, and 
  Page 13 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  seriousness. A list of  subjects  who prematurely discontinue from the 
study due to an AE  and the reason for discontinuation will be provided.  
The number and percentage of subject s reporting each medication will 
be summariz ed.  Medications taken by each subject  will be listed.  
Cutaneous T olerability :  
Cutaneous tolerability (erythema, scaling, dryness , pruritus, and 
burning/stinging ) will be summarized by treatment group at the 
Baseline, Day 14, Day 28 , Day 56, and Day  84 Visits.  Cutaneous 
tolerability will be  graded using the following scale: 0, None; 1, Slight; 
2, Moderate; 3, Severe.  
Sample Size:  
The sample size for this study is based on clinical considerations only. 
Subjects will be randomized 2:2:2 :1:1 with 90 subjects in each active 
treatment group and 45 in each vehicle group for a total 360 subjects.  
This is considered adequate to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
BTX 1503 in the treatment of acne vulgaris.

Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  2. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIF IC RATIONALE  
2.1. Background Information  
Botanix Pharmaceuticals ' BTX 1503 contain ing the active pharmaceutical ingredient , cannabidiol  
(CBD; 2-[(1R,6R) -6-isopropenyl -3-methylcyclohex- 2-en-1-yl]-5-pentylbenzene -1,3-diol) in a 
topical liquid formulation , is being developed  for the treatment of acne vulgaris .  CBD  is a member 
of a broader family of compounds known as cannabinoids, a class of compounds originally derived 
from the cannabis sativa plant.1 CBD is chemical ly synthesized  under  Good Manufacture Pract ices 
(GMP ) for use in this study . 
Synthetic CBD  is not psychoactive and clinical trials have demonstrated  that CBD  may 
successfully treat epilepsy, arthritis, pain , and even Fragile X Syndrome.2  Interest in CBD -based 
therapeutics has increased significant ly in recent years, as published data has highlighted the 
potential efficacy and safety benefits of this compound.3  There are now more than 100 human 
clinical trials that have been completed, are underway , or pending recruitment around the world 
that are studying CBD  in a range of diseases.4  
No known well-controlled, human clinical studies have ever been conducted using CBD to treat 
skin disease,  and no CBD  containing pharmaceuticals have been approved to treat skin disease . 
Researchers have found that CBD may play a beneficial role in regulating the cutaneous 
endocannabinoid system  by decreasing  unwanted skin cell growth, sebum production and skin 
inflammation associated with many human skin diseases.1   
2.2. Rationale  
2.2.1. Mechanism o f Action  
This study is intended to establish preliminary safety  and tolerability  in subject s with acne vulgaris 
treated  with  BTX 1503.  The rationale for the use of BTX 1503 in acne is provided herein. 
Acne is the most common skin disease in the world and is characterized  by partial obstruction  of 
the pores and associated local skin lesions that can appear on the face, chest or back.5,6  Obstructed  
pores can become enlarged and inflamed as sebum and its breakdown products accumulate, 
resulting in visible lesions that can be unsightly and cause permanent scarring.5,6 Acne usually 
begins in puberty and affects many adolescents and young adults, but it  can occur at any stage of 
life.  Approximately 85 percent of people between the ages of 12 and 24 experience at least minor 
acne.7 Acne often causes significant physical and psychological problems such as permanent 
scarring, poor self -image, depression and anxiety.8  
Acne lesions are believed to result from an interaction of four primary pathogenic factors:  
• the excessive production of sebum or lipids by sebaceous glands in the skin;  
• hyper -proliferation of keratinocytes  that contribute to clogging of pores through which 
sebum is normally released to the skin surface;  
  Page 20 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  • colonization of the area in and around the sebaceous gland by bacteria; and  
• inflammation, often associated with colonization by bacteria and their breakdow n of sebum 
into irritating breakdown products.1  
For many years , treatment of acne has been dominated by the same four prescription 
pharmaceutical product classes:  
i. Antimicrobials.   Antimicrobials for acne treatment target bacterial colonization and 
inflammation and are widely used topically and,  in more severe disease , orally.8  While 
antimicrobials have been shown to be effective, there is a growing interest in limiting the 
use of antibiotics in acne, because of concerns regarding bacterial resistance.9,10,6  
ii. Retinoids .  Topical retinoids address some of the changes in skin cells that contribute to 
clogging of the pores and are among the most commonly used prescription acne 
medications. Their limitations include skin irritation , photosensitization, and relatively 
modest efficacy in comparison with systemic therapies.10  
iii. Isotretinoin.  Oral isotretinoin (marketed initially as  Accutane or  Roaccutane) operates to 
significantly reduce sebum production and is indicated for the treatment of severe 
recalcitrant  nodular acne .  Even in the case of very severe disease, the efficacy of oral 
isotretinoin can be significant, with large proportions of patients achieving partial or 
complete clearance, after one course of therapy.8,11 However , oral isotretinoin is associ ated 
with significant systemic toxicity, including liver damage and severe birth defects, which 
largely limit its use as second line treatment in  patients with severe disease who enroll in 
a monitoring program intended to restrict distribution of the drug . Mood disorders, 
depression, suicidal ideation and suicides have been reported in patients taking oral 
isotretinoin, but a causal relationship has not been established.8,12,13,14,15  
iv. Hormonal therapies.  Oral agents that reduce the activity of sex hormone s (called 
androgens) are also highly effective, as these treatments also reduce sebum production.16 
Hormonal  therapies have well -known systemic side effects, such as mood disturbance, loss 
of muscle mass and reduced sexual desire, that are related to their  effects on sex hormones 
(they are most often used in the form of contraceptives). As such, they are not widely used 
in men or in women not seeking contraception.17  
No topical treatments are currently available which target all the above pathogenic factor s.18  Acne 
treatment guidelines recommend that acne treatment be directed toward as many of the four 
primary pathogenic factors as possible.19  Accordingly, patients are often treated with combination 
regimens that incorporate multiple agents with compleme ntary mechanisms of action targeting 
different pathogenic factors.20  While systemic therapies (such as isotretinoin) may inhibit sebum 
production, their use is limited by significant systemic side effects. An unmet need remains for 
effective therapies that are not associated with antibiotic resistance or treatment- limiting side  
effects, particularly therapies with novel mechanisms of action.9

Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  BTX 1503  is focused on modulating the body 's endocannabinoid system  of receptors which 
regulate  skin function, growth and renewal.21  It is understood that CBD  may play a significant 
role in normalizing  unwanted skin growth, reducing excessive production of oils and reducing 
inflammation and infection, amongst other functions.1  Botanix Pharmaceuticals is explor ing 
whether endocannabinoid modulating drugs (such as synthetic CBD ) can be exploited in the 
management of acne.  
BTX 1503 is a formulation of active synthetic CBD  and inactive excipients  designed to deliver a 
consistent dose of CBD  to directl y treat patients with acne. It is considered that CBD may : 
• normalize  excessive lipid synthesis of human sebocytes  
• decrease proliferation (but not the viability) of these human sebocytes;  
• inhibit hyperproliferation of keratinocytes;  
• exert  anti-inflammatory  actions; and 
• have anti -bacterial effects.1,22  
2.2.2. Nonclinical and Clinical Data  
Nonclinical information on the safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic s and metabolism, and 
toxicology profiles of CBD has been extensively  reported in the scientific literature.  The clinical 
safety of CBD has also been established and  reviewed in the published scientific literature.  
Clinical investigations with CBD have been reported in both normal subjects and patients, 
including treatment of individuals with oral doses of up to 300 mg/day ( 5 mg/kg/day or 185 
mg/m2/day, for an indivi dual with an average body weight of 60 kg ).  Higher oral doses of up to 
1,500 mg/day (25 mg/kg/day or 925 mg/m2/day) have been reported to be well tolerated .  CBD 
formulated as a topical gel (Zynerba Pharmaceuticals) for treatment of epilepsy has also been  
shown to be safe and well -tolerated with only mild, transient application site AEs observed.  
Botanix Pharmaceuticals has conducted a Phase 1a single and multiple -ascending dose study (BTX 
2017.001) of BTX 1503 in normal healthy volunteers in Australia  involving 20 subjects.  This 
study demonstrated that daily topical treatment with up to 3.75 mg/kg/day (225 mg CBD/day or 
0.398 mg/cm2/day1) applied as 3 mL of BTX 1503 5% (w/w) BID for 14 days was safe and well -
tolerated. Forty -two (42) AEs were reported in 18 of the 20 participants.  All AEs were reported 
as mild except one moderate vasovagal reaction to cannula insertion for blood draws (unrelated).  
Facial dryness and itchiness were the most frequently reported related AEs.  One subject reported 
applicati on site stinging, and one subject reported stinging in the eyes after accidental transfer of 
BTX 1503 into the eyes.  
In a subsequent Australian Phase1b open- label study (BTX .2017.002) of BTX 1503 in subjects 
with moderate to severe acne involving 21 subje cts, daily topical treatment with up to 3.75 
                                                 
1 Area of application assumed to be 565 cm2 (i.e., on the face), which is reported by the European Union Scientific Committee on 
Consumer Safety (SCCS) to be half of the surface area for a female head (SCCS Notes of Guidance for the Testin g of Cosmetic 
Substances and Their Safety Evaluation, 8th edition, 2012; Table  2). Available at: 
http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_s_006.pdf.  
  Page 22 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  mg/kg/day (225 mg CBD/day or 0.398 mg/cm2/day) applied as 3 mL of BTX 1503 5% (w/w) BID 
for 28 days was shown to be safe and well -tolerated. There was only 1 AE associated with the 
study drug treatment; application site pain (sore eyes).  Slight to moderate erythema was reported 
most frequently in cutaneous tolerability assessments.  However, most subjects that reported 
erythema pre or post -study drug application had erythema at Baseline and treatment with BTX 
1503 did not exacerbate the erythema.  Only 1 subject had increased erythema from Baseline and 
this was reported at Day 35, seven days after their final application of study drug.  Slight scaling 
was reported in 2 subjects (9.5%), slight dryness was reported in 4 subjects (19.0%) and slight 
burning/stinging was reported in 5 subjects (23.4%).  Only 1 positive cutaneous tolerability 
assessment (slight dryness) was reported at more than a single visit.   
In support of this planned Phase 2 clinical study , dermal toxicology studies of 90 days in duration 
in minipigs with BTX 1503 have not revealed any clinically significant toxicities or laboratory 
abnormalities. Details on the results of th ese studies  are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The published literature has suggested that CBD may be an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 
CYP1A1 at concentrations that are 9.7- fold of observed maximum plasma concentrations (C max) 
in clinical studies with BTX 1503. 
The testes was the only target organ for  toxicity identified in published studies in rats and monkeys: 
effects on sperm maturation were observed in a 25- day inhalation study in male rats [no -observed -
adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of less than 0.6 mg CBD/kg/day (< 3.6 mg/m2/day) and lower testis 
weights and inhibition of spermatogenesis were observed at a daily oral dose of 300 mg/kg 
CBD/kg/day (3,600 mg/m2/day) in male monkeys.  However, there were no changes in testis 
weight nor microscopic findings in the testes following 28 days of oral dosing in male rats at doses 
up to 400 mg/kg/day  with the CBD to be used in the BTX 1503 formulations.  The Area Under the 
Concen tration (AUC) exposures are over 1000 -fold higher th an reported in clinical studies 
involving BID dosing with BTX 1503.  In addition, there were no changes in testis weight nor 
microscopic correlates  in the testes following 90 days of dermal dosing in minipigs using 
BTX  1503 at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day  (AUC  exposures in males at least 24 -fold higher then 
observed in clinical studies wit h BTX 1503) .  
2.3. Rationale for Study  
This study is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BTX 1503 in subjects 
with moderate to severe acne.  In this study, BTX 1503 will be applied at 3 different dosage 
regimens and compared against  a Vehicle control.  The treatment period will be 12 weeks to 
coincide with the FDA’s recommended minimum treatment duration to demonstrate efficacy.  
  Page 23 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  2.4. Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.4.1. Known Potential Risks  
Based on studies conducted by Botanix  Pharmaceuticals , the potential risks associated with BTX  
1503 include:  
• Ocular irritation  
• Local application site AE’s  
• Cutaneous reactions which  may include erythema, dryness, scaling, and burning/stinging.   
Facial dryness and facial itchiness were reported as possible effects of study drug treatment in 
Botanix Pharmaceuticals’ healthy volunteer study  (BTX.2017.001 ).  In the current study, subjects 
will be allowed to use their usual moisturizers.  Subject s in this study will be given instructions on 
what to do if BTX  1503 liquid accidentally gets into the eyes.   
In the BTX .2017.002 study, s light to moderate erythema was reported most frequently in 
cutaneous tolerability assessments.  However, most subjects that reported erythema pre -or post -
study drug application had ery thema at Baseline and treatment with BTX 1503 did not exacerbate 
the erythema.  Only 1 subject had increased erythema from Baseline and this was reported at 
Day 35, seven days after their final application of study drug.  S light scaling was reported in 2 
subjects (9.5%), s light dryness was reported in 4 subjects (19.0%) and s light burning/stinging was 
reported in 5 subjects (23.4%).  Only one positive cutaneous tolerability assessment ( slight 
dryness) was reported at more than a single visit.      
In the published scientific literature, the only target organ for toxicity that has been identified was 
the testes in rat and monkey studies.  It is uncertain if the reduction in spermatogenesis noted in 
these animal studies has a clinical correlate.  In addition, this finding was not observed in the 28-
day oral rat study or in a 90- day dermal  minipig study conducted with Botanix  Pharmaceuticals’  
BTX 1 503.   
The other aspect of systemic exposure to CBD reported in the published scientific literature wa s 
the potential for competitive binding to CYP450 isozymes, indicating a potential for drug -drug 
interactions.  Given the limited systemic exposure obs erved in Botanix Pharmaceutical s’ healthy 
volunteer study , the potential for a drug -drug interactio n is c onsidered to be minimal.  
2.4.2. Known Potential Benefits  
Non-clinical data suggests BTX  1503 may target pathways relevant in pathogenesis of acne .  
Activity of BTX 1503 was observed in the BTX.2017.002 study in subject with moderate to severe 
acne.  S tatisticall y significant improvement s from Baseline in inflammatory and non- inflammatory 
lesion counts  were observed .  Improvements were also observed in the IGA and in the PRO. 
Although improvements in acne were observed in this 28- day treatment study, the benefit of 
BTX  1503 in patients  with  12 weeks of treatment  is unknown.

USA and to the Australian sites by Pharmaceutical Packaging Professionals (PPP) in Port 
Melbourne, Victoria, Australia .  Initial shipments will be made to supply the study site s prior to 
enrollment of the first subject . Additional supplies  will be made available as needed based on 
subject  enrollment.   
6.1.2. Formulations, Appearance, Packaging, and Labeling 
Botanix  Pharmaceuticals ’ BTX 1503 contains the  active pharmaceutical ingredient , cannabidiol 
(CBD) .  CBD  is a member of a broader family of compounds known as cannabinoids, a class of 
compounds originally derived from the cannabis sativa plant.1  CBD is chemical ly synthesized  
under  Good M anufacturing P ractices (GMP)  for use in this study . 
The active study product is a clear to light yellow , slightly viscous liquid with a 2.5% or 5%  (w/w) 
concentration of CBD in a formulation of excipients which have been used extensively in other 
topical products.  The liquid  spreads easily and quickly evaporates , leaving the  CBD and a small 
amount of excipients  on the skin.  The Vehicle liquid is identical in appearance to the BTX 1503 
liquid .   
Each milliliter of the BTX 1503 5% liquid formulation contains 37.5 mg of CBD.  Each milliliter 
of the BTX  1503 2.5% liquid formulat ion contains 18.75 mg of CBD.  All subjects will apply 2.0 
mL, 4 pump actuations, of BTX 1503 BID or QD or Vehicle BID or QD based on their randomized 
treatment group.  Subjects will receive the following daily exposure to CBD. 
• Subjects randomized to BTX 1503 5% BID will apply 150.0 mg of CBD daily,    
• Subjects randomized to BTX 1503 5% QD will apply 75.0 mg of CBD daily,    
• Subjects randomized to BTX 1503 2.5% QD will apply 37.5 mg of CBD daily.  
Study drug will be supplied in 60 mL multi- dose, metered pumps delivering 0.5 mL per actuation.  
Each pump for BID dosing will contain approximately 39 mL of study drug and each pump for 
QD dosing will contain approximately 21 mL of study drug .  This will provide dosing for 7 days 
for all  subjects.  Pumps for all groups will be labeled identically, except for kit number  and bottle 
number , to maintain the blind.   
Study drug will be pumped into the palm of one hand and applied to the face using finger tips of 
the other hand.  Study drug will  be applied to the entire face, regardless of location of acne lesions.   
Study drug will be provided in kits .  Each kit will contain  adequate study drug for 4 weeks of daily 
applications (28 days).  Prior to distribution, pumps will be weighed by clinical site staff and the 
weights recorded in the source documents and the eCRF.  Each kit will contain 4 pumps, one for 
  Page 33 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  each week of dosing.  When a subject is enrolled, the site will access the IWRS to receive a kit 
number for the first 28 days of dosing  based  on the IWRS randomization.  At the Day 28 and Day 
56 Visits, the  site will access the IWRS to obtain the kit number for the following 28 days of 
dosing.  All distributed pumps will be returned by the subject at the Day 28, Day 56, and Day  84

  Page 46 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
8.1. Specification of Safety Parameters  
8.1.1. Definition of Adverse E vents (AE)  
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a study subject  which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of study drug  treatment, whether or not considered 
related t o the study drug .   
Any events involving illnesses or injuries with onset during the study or any events involving 
exacerbations of pre- existing illnesses should be recorded.  All clearly related signs and symptoms 
should be grouped together and recorded a s a single diagnosis in the eCRF .  A pre -existing 
condition will not be reported as an AE  unless the condition worsens during the trial.  The 
condition, however, must be reported in the Medical History section of the e CRF. Scheduled or 
planned diagnostic and therapeutic procedures such as surgery will not be reported as AE s.   
8.1.2. Definition  of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Each AE will be independently judged by the investigator in terms of seriousness .  A serious AE  
(SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitali zation  or prolongation of existing hospitali zation , 
• Results in permanent impairme nt of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude any one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition.  
  Page 47 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  8.2. Classification of Adverse Events  
8.2.1. Relationshi p to Study Drug 
The investigator  will review each event and assess its  relationship (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, 
probably, definitely)  to drug treatment.  The following definitions will be used for these causality 
assessments.  
Unrelated  • The AE must clearly be caused by the subject ’s clinical state, or the 
study procedure/conditions. 
• Definitely not related to drug.  
• Temporal sequence of an AE onset relative to administration of drug 
not reasonable.  
• Another obvious cause of an AE.  
Unlikely  • Time sequence is unreasonable.  
• There is another more likely cause for an AE.  
Possibly  • Corresponds to what is known about the drug.  
• Time sequence is reasonable.  
• Could have been due to another equally, likely cause. 
Probably  • Is a known effect of the drug.  
• Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.  
• Ceases on stopping the drug.  
• Cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
subject ’s clinical state.  
Definitely  • Is a known effect of the drug (e.g., listed in Investigator’s Brochure ). 
• Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.  
• Event stops upon stopping drug, event returns upon restarting drug.  
NOTE: Re -challenge will only be considered after consultation with 
the medical monitor and the sponsor. 
 
  Page 48 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.2. Severity of Event  
Each sign or sympt om reported will be graded on a 5-point severity scale (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).  
The following definitions for rating maximum severity will be used: 
Grade 1  
 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  
 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.*  
Grade 3  
 Severe or medically significant but not immediat ely life -threatening; 
hospitalis ation or prolongation of hospitali sation indicated; disabling; 
limiting self -care activities of daily living.**  
Note : An experience may be severe but may not be serious, ( e.g., severe 
headache).  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Note:  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
*Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care activities of daily living refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
8.2.3. Expectedness  
For this study, all AEs  will be recorded.   
The safety and tolerability of BTX 1503 5% was evaluated in a Phase 1a study in healthy 
volunteers  and in a Phase 1b study in subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris .  These studies  
demonstrated that BTX 1503 5% was safe and well tolerated with up to 3 mL applied BID  (225 
mg CBD daily)  for up to 28 days .  Adverse  events reported as related to study drug treatment were 
facial dryness and itchiness. Mild c utaneous reactions include d erythema, dryness, scaling, and 
burning/stinging.   
Studies of the active ingredient (CBD) administered orall y in multiple therapeutic settings has 
described no consistent findings for systemic AEs.  Based on findings in a cumulative irritation 
study of the BTX 1503 vehicle, mild skin irritation may occur.  
8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
All AEs occurring after signing of the consent /assent  form through completion of the Day 84 Visit 
will be recorded.  AEs arising after  the time of initiation of first treatment with study drug  will be 
  Page 49 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  considered treatment emergent AE s (TEAEs) .  At each  contact with the subject , the investigator 
or designee will seek information on AE s by non- leading specific questioning and, as appropriate, 
by examination.   All observed or volunteered AE s, regardless of suspected causal relationship to 
study drug , must be recorded on the AE  page of the e CRF.  
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits 
and interviews of a study subject  presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions will be recorded. All AEs occurring while on study 
must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
resolution or considered stable by the investigator .  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the 
event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized  as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
8.4. Reporting Procedures  
8.4.1. Adverse Events  Reporting 
All AEs will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  For each AE, the name of the event, date of onset, 
relationship to study drug, severity , seriousness (Y/N), whether a medication was used to treat the 
event, date of resolution (or ongoing), and outcome ( fatal, r ecovered/ resolved, recovered/ resolved  
with sequelae, ongoing)  will be noted. 
8.4.2. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Each AE will be independently judged by the investigator in terms of seriousness .  A SAE is 
defined in Section 8.1.2.  
All SAEs will be reported to the sponsor  via fax or e- mail within 24 hours of becoming aware of 
the event, whether or not the serious events are deemed drug -related.  All serious event reporting 
will adhere to 21 CFR  312.32 for Investigational New Drugs (IND) and to the Guidance for 
Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
Bioavailability/Bioequivalence, dated December 2012. The IRB/ EC will be notified of the Alert 
Reports. 
All AEs will be followed until resolution or until the investigator determines that  the subject ’s 
status has returned to normal  or has stabilized . 
8.4.3. Reporting of Pregnancy  
As part of the eligibility criteria, WOCBP  must agree  to use appropriate contraception methods to 
avoid pregnancy during the study.  If a subject  does become pregnant, or is suspected of being 
  Page 50 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  pregnant, the subject  will be immediately withdrawn from any further treatment with the study 
drug.  The pregnancy, or suspected pregnancy will be immediately reported to the m edical monitor. 
Any subject  that becomes pregnant during the study will be followed to term to collect pregnancy 
outcome s pending acquisition of  the subject ’s permission.   
8.5. Safety Oversight  
Oversi ght of the safety of the study will be the responsibility of the m edical monitor.  Safety data 
will be regularly reviewed (monthly at a minimum).  If unexpected safety signals are observed, 
the medical monitor  and the sponsor will determine if the enrollme nt or the study should be 
discontinued, or the protocol amended to include additional safety monitoring.    
 
  Page 51 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared for this study.  The statis tical 
approaches to analysis of the data are described in this protocol.  Further detail on the structure of 
tables, listings, and figures is provided in the SAP.   
9.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to describe the safety and effi cacy of treatment with the BTX 
1503 5% l iquid f ormulation or 2.5%  liquid formulation  vs Vehicle liquid formulation  with QD or 
BID dosing in subjects with acne vulgaris.  P -values for selected variables will be presented to 
assist in evaluating the outcome of the study. Failure to achieve a statistically significant result 
does not imply a failed study; results from this study will be used to inform statistical approaches 
for registration studies.   
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion 
counts.  The study will evaluate the superiority of active study drug over vehicle based on the 
following hypotheses:  
H0: µactive - µvehicle = 0  
H1: µactive - µvehicle > 0. 
Where H 0 is the null hypothesis, H 1 the alternative hypotheses, µ active is the absolute change in the 
number of inflammatory lesions counts from Baseline to Day 84, and µ vehicle  is the absolute change 
in the number of inflammatory lesions counts from Baseline to Day 84.   
Secondary and exploratory endpoints do not have a priori hypotheses but  will be evaluated using 
appropriate statistical methods to inform statistical approaches for future studies.  
9.3. Analysis Datasets  
This study will be evaluated using 3 analysis sets: intent- to-treat (ITT), per protocol (PP), and 
safety.  Efficacy conclusions will be drawn from the ITT analysis set.  The PP analysis set will be 
used to support the efficacy findings in the ITT analyses. Safety conclusions will be drawn from 
the safety analysis set.  
The ITT analysis set includes  all subjects who are randomize d and is based on randomized study 
group, regardless of study drug received.  The safety analy sis set includes  all subjects who are 
randomized, receive  at least 1  confirmed dos e of study drug, and have  at least 1 post -Baseline 
assessment.  The safety analysis set will be assessed based on study drug received, regardless of 
group to which subject wa s randomized.  The PP analysis set includes  all subjects in the ITT 
analysis set who complete the Day 84 visit without noteworthy study protocol violations , including 
compliance with study drug application, Day 84 visit window, and completion of efficacy 
  Page 52 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  evaluations on Day 84.  The full definition of the PP population is given in the SAP  which will be 
approved prior to database lock.  
Subjects who have a documented lack of treatment effect or who are discontinued from the study 
due to an AE that was consider ed by the investigator to be study drug related will be included in 
the PP analysis set.  Specific criteria for identifying the PP analysis set will be determined prior to 
breaking the blind.    
Vehicle QD and Vehicle BID groups may be combined for analyses.  
9.4. Description of Statistical Methods  
9.4.1. General Approach  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® 9.3 or higher. Demographics will be 
summariz ed by age, gender, race, ethnicity , height and weight.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for change from B aseline in lesion counts (inflammatory and non -inflammatory separate 
and combined) and IGA.  For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation (SD), median , 
and range will be presented.   Categorical variables will be summari zed by frequency counts and 
percentages.   
9.4.2. Safety Analyses  
All subjects  who receive at least one confirmed dose of study drug and have at least one post -
Baseline assessment will be included in the safety anal yses.  
All treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported  during the study will be recorded and 
classified based on MedDRA terminology. Treatment -emergent adverse events are those AEs with 
an onset on or after the first application of study medication. All reported TEAEs will be 
summarize d by treatment group, the number of subjects  reporting events, system organ class, 
preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness. When summarizing  events by 
causality  and severity, each subject  will be counted only once within a system organ class or a 
preferred term by using the event with the greatest relationship and highest severity within each 
classification.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summari zed by cohort , system organ class, pr eferred term, 
severity, outcome and relationship to study drug; and all SAEs will be listed by subject . In addition, 
a list of  subjects  who prematurely discontinue from the study due to an AE and the reason for 
discontinuation will be provided. 
Concomitant  medication will be mapped to ATC Level 2 using the WHODrug dictionary.  The 
number and percentage of subject s reporting each medication will be summariz ed.  Medications 
taken by each subject  will be listed.  
  Page 53 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  Changes from Baseline in safety laboratory asses sments (CBC , chemistry and urinalysis) at 
Day 84 will be summarized using shift tables.  Abnormal values will be summarized.  Laboratory 
values will be listed by subject.   
Cutaneous tolerability  will be assessed at the Baseline, Day 14, Day 28 , Day 56 and Day 84  Visits .  
Summaries will present frequencies and percentages for the grading of each of the signs/symptoms 
that was performed at each scheduled visit/time point combination.  The summary of cutaneous 
tolerability assessment scores table will present  summary statistics for the scores (‘None’=0, 
‘Slight’=1, ‘Moderate’=2 and ‘ Severe’ =3) and the change from Baseline val ues at each scheduled 
post-Baseline visits/time point for each of the signs/symptoms.  Listings will be provided by 
subject.   
9.4.3. Efficacy A nalyses  
The efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT (primary) and PP (supportive) analysis sets. 
The efficacy variables include the IGA and lesion counts (inflammatory and non- inflammatory) 
collected at Screening/Baseline and the Day 14, Day 28 , Day 56, and Day 84  Visits.  Absolute and 
percent changes in lesion counts from Baseline will be calculated for each subject.  The IGA will 
be dichotomized into “success” and “failure”, with a subject considered a “success” at each 
individual visit if the I GA at that visit is Clear (“0”) or Almost Clear (“1”) and at least 2 grades 
less than the Baseline score.  Efficacy variables also include the Acne- QoL assessed at Baseline 
and Day 84 which will be scored according to the author ’s scoring system (Martin 20 01), and the 
subject’s assessment of improvement (PRO) using proportions by category.  
Descriptive statistics (including mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum, 
unless otherwise stated) will be presented for the following parameters by study group using both 
the ITT and PP analysis sets:  
• Inflammatory , non- inflammatory , and total  lesion counts at Baseline and study Day 14, 
Day 28 , Day 56, and Day 84, 
• Absolute and percent change from Baseline in inflammatory , non -inflammatory , and total  
lesion counts at study Day 14, Day 28 , Day 56, and Day 84, and  
• IGA scores and f requency and percent distribution of the dichotomized IGA at study Day 
14, Day 28 , Day 56, and Day 84.  
Primary endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is:  
• Absolut e change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion count s at Day 84 . 
Secondary endpoints :   
The secondary endpoints for the study are:  
• Absolute  change from B aseline in non- inflammatory lesion count  at Day 84 ,  
  Page 54 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  • The percent change from B aseline in the  inflammatory lesion count at Day 84,  
• The percent change from Baseline in the non -inflammatory lesion count at Day 84,  
• The proportion of subjects  with  at least a 2 -grade reduction from the Baseline IGA score 
at Day 84,  
• The proportion of subjects  with an I GA score of “clear” or “almost clear” at Day 84, and  
• The proportion of subjects  with an IGA score of “clear” or “almost clear” at Day 84 and 
at least a 2 -grade reduction from the Baseline IGA score.  
Exploratory endpoints : 
The exploratory endpoints are:  
• The change from Baseline in the total lesion count at Day 84,  
• The percent change from Baseline i n the total lesion count at Day  84, 
• The change from baseline in the IGA scores  and Day 84,  
• The absolute and percent change from Baseline in inflammatory , non -inflammatory and 
total lesion counts  at Day 14, Day 28 and Day  56. 
• The proportion of subjects  with  at least a 2 -grade reduction from the Baseline IGA score 
at Day 14, Day 28 and Day 56, and  
• The proportion of subjects  with an IGA score of “clear” or “almost clear” at Day 14, 
Day 28 and Day 56,  
• The proportion of subjects  with an IGA score of “clear” or “almost clear” at Day 14, 
Day 28 and Day 56 and at least a 2 -grade reduction from the Baseline IGA score.  
• The change from Baseline in the Acne -QoL at Day 84, and  
• Subject’s  assessment of the change in their acne from baseline to Day 84 (PRO).  
Tests of superiority for the primary and secondary endpoints of absolute change from Baseline in 
lesion  counts  will be  based on either parametric or nonparametric methods consistent with the 
statistical assumptions required to support the analyses. Specifically, the tests of superiority will 
be based on an ANCOVA with factors of treatment  and the respective Baseline lesion count as 
covariates , or on ranked data submitted to an ANCOVA with factors of treatment , analysis center , 
and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate.    
Data will be reviewed for skewedness  (details in the SAP) .  If a parametric analysis is  indicated, 
the results of the parametric analysis will be  considered the  primary analysis.   If a nonparametric 
analysis is indicated, the absolute or percent changes in inflammatory lesion  count s will be rank -
transformed prior to submitting them to the AN COVA. Results of the rank- transformed analyses 
  Page 55 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  will then be considered the primary analysis; results of th e nonrank- transformed analyses will be 
also presented.  
The dichotomized IGA will be  analyzed with logistic regression, adjusting for baseline IGA and 
site.  Pairwise tests will be conducted comparing the treated groups to vehicle.  The lesion count 
and IGA analyses employ the methods  for handling missing data  described in Section 9.4.9. 
9.4.4. Subset analyses  
Subset analyses will be conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint . These analyses will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.   The specific subsets within the ITT analysis set that will 
be evaluated include: B aseline lesion counts , Baseline IGA, sex, age, ethnicity , race, and for  the 
group less than the median age and greater than or equal to the median age.  
9.4.5. Adherence and Retention Analyses  
Compliance with study drug administration will be summarise d based on dosing information from 
the clinical sites along with diary information obtained from subject s self-administering the study 
drug.  Subject s who drop -out from the study for any reason will  be summarise d.   
9.4.6. Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Demographics will be summarise d by age, gender, race, ethnicity , height , and weight.  Alcohol 
and tobacco history will be summaris ed, 
9.4.7. Planned Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis is planned.   
9.4.8. Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity  
This Phase 2 study is designed to identify the response to two different concentrations and dosing 
frequencies  of BTX 1503. Statistical tests applied to the outcomes will be exploratory for 
establishing the dose and sample size for Phase 3 studies.   No adjustments for Type 1 error will 
occur.  
9.4.9. Handling of Missing Data  
All efforts will be made to minimize the occurrence of missing data. It is not expected that dropout 
rates will differ between groups.  Therefore, t he primary method of  handling missing efficacy data 
in the ITT analysis set will be based on last observation carried forward (LOCF).  
Other imputation methods (e.g., MMRM) may be used as a sensitivity analysi s to the LOCF  
method.  
  Page 56 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  All s afety analyses will be  conducted using  the safety analysis set. No imputation s will be made 
for missing safety data.    
Additional details on imputation and sensitivity analyses are provided in the SAP.  
9.4.10. Tabulation of Individual Response Data  
Individual response data will be presented in data li stings.     
9.5. Sample Size  
The sample size for this study is based on clinical considerations only.   Subjects will be 
randomized 2:2:2 :1:1 with 90 subjects in each active treatment group  and 45 subjects in each 
vehicle group for a total 360 subjects.  This is considered adequate to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of BTX 1503 in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  
9.6. Measures  to Minimize  Bias 
9.6.1. Enrollment/Randomi zation/Masking Procedures  
 A randomi zation code will be prepared by an unblinded statistician at the CRO .  This statistician 
will be the only person aware of the randomi zation code.  Randomi zation will be 2:2 :2:1:1 ( 90 
subjects in each active group and 45  in each vehicle group) and done by site.  Once a subject  is 
deemed eligible to enroll, randomi zation will occur.  The site will contact the IVRS/IWRS to 
receive the kit number to be used for that subject  throughout the study.   
Study drug, active or vehicle, will be labelled identically except for the kit number  and bottle 
number .  Study drug  pumps  will contain approximately 39 mL for BID dosing groups and 
approximately 21 mL for QD dosing groups . There is no double -dummy in this study for BID vs 
QD dosing , so knowledge of volumes (during study drug accountability) will not unmask treatment  
groups  (active vs vehicle) . The vehicle study drug is indistinguishable from the active study drug.     
9.6.2. Evaluation of Success of Blinding 
For this Phase 2 study, no analyses to evaluate the success of the blinding will be conducted.  
Subjects know n to have been unblinded during the study will be addressed in the final analysis as 
described in the SAP.    
9.6.3. Breaking the Study Blind/ Subject  Code  
During the study, the randomi zation code will not be broken except in the case of a safety concern, 
either for an individua l subject  or for the entire study.  
If a subject  has an adverse event that may necessitate unblinding of the randomi zation code, the 
site will contact the CRO and sponsor to discuss if there are options other than unblinding.  If the 
site and sponsor agree that unblinding is in the best interests of the subject , the unblinded 
statistician will be contacted to conduct the unblinding.  F or circumstances where the CRO or 
  Page 57 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  sponsor cannot be contacted,  and the subject  is in imminent danger without knowledge of the ir 
treatment , unblinding can be done through the IVRS/IWRS system .     
At the completion of the study, the blind will be broken only after all data on all subject s has been 
entered into the database and the database is locked.  Database lock procedures wil l follow the 
CRO’s  SOPs.

Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  10. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This research will be carried out in accordance with the protocol, the ICH harmonized tripartite 
guideline regarding GCP  (E6 Consolidated Guidance, June 1996) , the National S tatement on 
Ethical Conduct in Human Research (updated May 2015), and the ethical principles set forth in 
the Declaration of Helsinki.  
10.1. Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations  
10.1.1. Informed Consent /Assent  Process  
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator (if acceptable 
by local regulations), to obtain written informed consent /assent  from each subject  participating in 
this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives and potential hazards of the 
study.  It must also be explained to the subjects  that they are completely free to refuse to enter the 
study or to withdraw from it at any  time for any reason.  In states or institutions where permission 
is required from a legal guardian and the child is required to assent to participate, the appropriate 
assent -permission process will be followed according to the relevant local and/or state laws.   
Appropriate IRB/EC -approved forms for obtaining written informed consent /assent  will be 
provided by the investigator or by the sponsor or its designee .   
The case report forms for this study contain a section for documenting informed consent /assent  
and this must be completed appropriately.  If new safety information results in significant changes 
in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent /assent  form will be reviewed and updated if necessary.  
All subjects  (including those already being treated) will be informed of the new information, given 
a copy of the revised form and be re -consented /assented  to continue in the study.  
10.1.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)  
This protocol, the informed consent /assent  form and any accompanying materi al provided to the 
subject  (such as subject  information sheets or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed 
consent /assent ) as well as any advertising or compensation given to the subject , will be reviewed 
by the IRB/EC , and the study will not star t until the IRB/EC  has approved the protocol or a 
modification thereof.  The IRB/EC  is constituted and operates in accordance with the principles 
and requirements described in 21 CFR 56, ICH E6, and the National Statement on Ethical Conduct 
in Human Resear ch (updated May 2015) .  
Protocol modifications to this study  must be made only after consultation between an appropriate 
representative of the sponsor and the investigator.  Protocol amendments must be prepared and 
approved by the sponsor  and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC prior to implementation . 
10.1.3. Subject and Data Confidentiality  
Subject  confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, their staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is e xtended to cover testing of biological samples 
  Page 59 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  in addition to the clinical information relating to subject s. Therefore, the study protocol, 
documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No 
information concernin g the study or data will be released to any unauthori zed third party without 
prior written approval of the sponsor.  
The study monitor, other authori zed representatives of the sponsor, or representatives of the 
IRB/EC may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, 
including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for 
the subject s in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
The study subject ’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use 
during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location 
as described in Section  10.1.9.  
Study subject  research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, 
will be transmitted to and stored at the CRO . This will not include the subject ’s contact or 
identifying information. Rather, individual subject s and their research data will be identified by a 
unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by 
clinical sites and by the clinical sites’  research staff will be secured and password protected. At 
the end of the study, all study databases will be de -identified and archived at the CRO and 
ultimately with the sponsor.  
10.1.4. Research Use of Stored Human Samples, Specimens or Data  
Samples and data collected  under this protocol will  be used to study the safety of the study drug, 
BTX 1503 liquid formulation. No genetic testing will be performed.  Samples and data will be 
stored using codes assigned by the clinical study site, the CROs, and/or the laboratories assessing 
the samples . Data will be kept in password- protected computers. Only those entities participating 
in the study  will have a ccess to the samples and data.  
The study involves taking digital photographs of the subject ’s face  at selected sites . The s ubject  or 
subject’s parent/guardian will consent /assent , in advance of any photographs  being taken, to the 
taking, copyright, publication, and use of their photographs .  The subject ’s eyes will be masked to 
conceal their identity. The photographs will be p art of the study record and will be sent to the 
sponsor and regulatory agencies. The photographs will only be linked to the subject ’s study code 
and not the subject ’s name.   
10.1.5. Future Use of Stored Specimens  
All blood and urine samples used for assessment or  study drug safety will be destroyed after 
analysis.  No specimens will be stored for future use. 
10.1.6. Key Roles and Study Administration  
The sponsor of this study is Botanix Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Botanix).  Botanix has engaged Premier 
Research (Durham, North Carolina, US) to oversee the conduct of the study.  Premier will conduct 
  Page 60 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  the data management, clinical monitoring and statistical management of the study.  The medical 
monitor for this study will be provided by Premier.  His/her responsibility will be to ove rsee the 
safety of subjects in the study.   
The IRB/EC, which protects the rights and welfare of subjects, will be either local or centralized 
based on the study site.  Central IRBs will be preferentially used when possible.  Clinical sites 
outside of the US, will have IRB/EC oversight based on local and national requirements.  
Photography of facial acne at selected sites will be performed utilizing equipment from a 
photography vendor.  The vendor will provide a Photography Manual describing correct 
techniques for photographing subjects.  Photographs from the study are the property of Botanix 
and will become part of the study record.   
Study drug will be manufactured in the United States.  The Coghlan Group (TCG; Bastrop, Texas, 
USA)  is responsible for  packag ing, labeling , and distribution of the study drug.  
A qualified vendor will  act as the central lab for analysis of the blood and urine samples.  Results 
will be provided to the sites for their subject management and to Premier for data analysis.   
There wi ll be no DSMB for this study.  Blinded safety data will be reviewed in real -time by the 
medical monitor to assure subject safety.  
10.1.7. Clinical Monitoring  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well- being of human subjects  
are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct 
of the study  is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and 
with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by a CRO contracted by the sponsor to conduct this 
activity .  
On-site monitoring will occur for initial site assessment and training throughout the study  and at a 
frequency adequate to assess the above based on t he number of subjects enrolled at each site and 
the time from enrollment of the subjects.  The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports 
and other subject  records needed to verify the entries on the Case Report Form.  The investigator 
(or his/her designee) agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected 
during these monitoring visits are resolved.  
A site visit monitoring report will be prepared for each visit.  Details of clinical site monitoring 
are documented in the Clinical Monitoring Plan  (CMP ). The CMP describes in detail who will 
conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail 
monitor ing will be performed, and the preparation and distribution of monitoring reports.  
Independent audits may be  conducted by auditors from the sponsor or its designee or regulatory 
agencies.   
  Page 61 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.8. Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
Each clinical site, CRO, and  laboratory participating in this study will have SOPs for quality 
management that describe:  
• How data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol, ethical standards, regulatory 
compliance, and accuracy in relation to source documents.  
• The documents  to be reviewed (e.g., eCRF s, clinic notes, product accountability records, 
specimen tracking logs, questionnaires, audio or video recordings), who is responsible, and 
the frequency for reviews.  
• Who will be responsible for addressing QA issues (e.g., corr ecting procedures that are not 
in compliance with protocol) and QC issues (e.g., correcting errors in data entry).  
• Staff training methods and how such training will be tracked.  
• If applicable, calibration exercises conducted prior to and during the study to train 
examiners and maintain acceptable intra- and inter -examiner agreement.  
QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that 
will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies  will be 
communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
Following written SOPs, the clinical study monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted, 
and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, 
GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, 
and reports for moni toring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and regulatory 
authorities.  
10.1.9. Data Handling and Record Keeping  
The investigator shall supply the sponsor or its designee on request wit h any required background 
data from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly important when data on 
the electronic Case Report Forms requires clarification.  In case of special problems/and or 
governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the 
complete study records, provided that subject  confidentiality is protected.  
All source data forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink and must be legible.  Errors 
should be crossed out  with a single line,  but not obliterated, the correction ins erted, and the change 
initialed and dated by the investigator or his/her authori zed delegate.   
The investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made available 
to appropriately qualified personnel from the sponsor  or its de signees or to health authority 
inspectors after appropriate notification.  The verification of the eCRF  Data must be by direct 
inspection of source documents. 
  Page 62 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  For each subject  enrolled, a n eCRF  must be completed by an authori zed delegate from the study 
staff and  signed by the principal investigator.  If a subject  withdraws from the study, the reason 
must be noted on the eCRF .  If a subject  is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment -
limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearl y document the outcome.  The 
investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to the 
sponsor in the eCRF ’s and in all required reports.  
Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and research records  for this trial, in 
compliance with ICH E6 and regulatory and institutional requirements for the protection of 
confidentiality of subject s.  
Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clin ical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Examples 
of these original documents and data records include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinic 
and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subject s’ memory aids or evaluation checklists, 
subject diaries, pharmacy dispensing  records, recorded audio tapes of counseling sessions , 
recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as 
being accurate and complete, microfiches , photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, 
x-rays, and subject  files and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in the clinical trial.  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the 
site principal investigator . The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copies. When making 
changes or corrections, cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the 
change. DO NOT ERASE, OVE RWRITE, OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE 
ORIGINAL.  
Source documents will be  maintained for recording data for each subject  enrolled in the study. 
Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the source 
documents or the discrepancies should be explained and captured in a progress note and 
maintained in the subject ’s official study record.  
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and 
clinical laboratory data will b e entered into the electronic data capture (EDC) system , a 21 CFR 
Part 11 -compliant data capture system provided by the CRO . The data system includes password 
protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear 
inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source 
documents. 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
  Page 63 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  be classified into two different separate categories (1) Investig ator’s Study File, and (2) Subject  
clinical source documents. The Investigator’s Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, 
Case Report and Query Form s, IRB/EC  and governmental approval  (as appropriate)  with 
correspondence, sample informed consent /assent , study drug  records, staff curriculum vitae and 
authori zation forms and other appropriate documents/correspondence. All records defined in 21 
CFR 312.57 will be kept on file.  
The investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least 2 years after the 
latest of the following: completion, discontinuation of the study, or the regulatory submission for 
which the study is being performed is no longer under review.  After that , the documents may be 
destroyed, subject  to local regul ations. 
Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, the sponsor  must be notified in advance.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site for any  or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor  
to store these in a sealed container(s) off -site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator 
in case of a regulatory audit.  Where source docum ents are required for the continued care of the 
subject , appropriate copies should be made for storing outside of the site.  
The investigator shall supply the sponsor on request with a ny required background data from the 
study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly important when data on the eCRFs  
requires clarification.  In case of special problems/and or governmental queries or requests for 
audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, ensuring  that 
subject  confidentiality is protected.  
10.1.10. Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or other study  
requirements  (e.g., SOPs, Laboratory Manuals, etc) . The noncompliance may be either on the part 
of the subject , the investigator, or the study site staff.  As a result of deviations, corrective actions 
are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations within 
5 working days of identificatio n of the protocol deviation, or within 5  working days of the 
scheduled protocol -required activity. All deviations must be addr essed in study source documents 
and reported to the clinical study monitor or to the CRO .  Protocol deviations must be sent to the  
IRB/EC  per their guidelines. The site investigator /study staff is responsible for knowing and 
adhering to their IRB/EC  requirements.  
  Page 64 
Protocol BTX.2018.001 Version 2.4 07-June -2018 CONFIDENTIAL  It is not anticipated that waivers of eligibility requirements will be granted for any subjects.  
However, if eligibility  requirements are waived in special circumstances, waivers must be 
approved by the medical monitor and the sponsor before a subject may be enrolled.  
Documentation of granted waivers will be maintained in the investigator’s and sponsor’s files.  
10.1.11. Publication  and Data Sharing Policy  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  T he investigator 
agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Botanix Pharmaceuticals at least 30 days prior to 
submission.  This allows Botanix P harmaceuticals to protect proprietary information and to 
provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the 
investigator.  
In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, Botanix Pharmaceuticals will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials in their entirety .  In this case, a coordinating investigator 
will be designated by mutual agreement.  Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement.  
10.2. Conflict of Interest Policy  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence is critical.  Therefore, any 
actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, 
or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and managed.   Furthermore, pers ons who have a 
perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed in a way that is 
appropriate to their participation in the study . The study leadership has established policies and 
procedures for all study group members to disc lose all conflicts of interest and will establish a 
mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.

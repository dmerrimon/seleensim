11 Only one sample to be collected at the time of PD or the time of initiation of other anti -leukemia therapy, which 
may be at the EOT /EOFT , if PD or initiation of other anti -leukemia therapy occurs during treatment, or during 
follow -up. If the patient is non -progressing/not receiving other anti -leukemia therapy at the end of follow -up or the 
trial, the sample will be obtained at the last follow -up visit for this patient.
 
 
  
 
 
16 Can be performed up to 2 days prior to this visit.
17 After the 8thinfusion, at the end of treatment visit, p atients will be evaluated to determine if they have clinical 
benefit , as defined by IWG objective response ( PR, CRi or CR ) or subjective response (in the absence of objective 
response) and are tolerating the infusions well and who would like to continue toreceive infusions until PD or 
other criteria for withdrawal are met as noted in Section 3.3.4.1.  For each infusion past the 8thadministration, 
patients will continue to be assessed after each cycle for clinical benefit (objective or subjective response), and that 
they are tolerating the infusions well and would like to continue until PD or other criteria for withdrawal are met as 
noted in Section 3.3.4.1 .

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Acute m yeloid leuk emia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic
progenitor cells and represents the most common malignant m yeloid disorder in adults, with a 
prevalence of 3.8 cases per 100,000 rising to 17.9 cases per 100, 000 adults aged 65 y ears and 
older (R07-2768) . The median age at present ation is about 70 years, and three men are 
affected for every  two women. Without therapeutic intervention the disease progresses and 
leads to death within months after initial diagnosis ( R07-2768 ).
Genetic alterations in leukemic cells constitute the most important factor for the prognosis of 
AML  (R07-2768, R07- 2770 , R07-2774 ). AML patients are classified in groups of favorable, 
intermediate, and unfavo rable risk. Other factors with impact on progn osis are age, 
performance score, white blood cell count, blood chemistry  disturbances and de -novo versus 
secondary  AML.
Intensive treatment approaches for AML with curative intention include two phases. The 
first, induction treatment, most commonly  consist s of cy tarabine and an anthracy cline, is 
aiming to reach aCR. The second phase, post-remission treatment, is aiming to consolidate 
remission. AML  patients under the age of 60 years achieve complete remission rates of up 
to75 % following intensive treatmen t regimens, while AML  patients over 60 years of age 
(referred to as elderly  patients) have a 40 - 60 % chance of CR when receiving intensive 
remission induction treatment ( R07-2767 ).
While the majority  of younger AML patients receive intensive treatment, a substantial 
number of elderly  patients are considered ineligible for this treatment approach 
(R07-2773 ,R07-2854 ). Therefore, the CR rates up to 60 % reported in eld erly previousl y 
untreated AML patients receiving intensive treatment are b y no means representative of the 
entire group of elderl y AML  patients. For AML patients considered ineligible to receive 
intensive treatment investigational treatments is widely  rega rded as the preferred therapeutic 
option ( R07-2769 ,R07-2772 ). With these non -approved drugs CR rates up to 20 % are 
observed in randomized Phase IIItrials . Although patients who are considered a s ineligible 
for intensive treatment constitute a generall y accepted subgroup of AML patients, no 
validated criteria are defined to judge a patient's eligibility  for intensive treatment 
(R07-2771 ). The assessment of eligibility  forintensive treatment is performed regularly for 
every  single patient based on the specialised physician's clinical experience and the 
comprehensive review of factors such as patient age, performance score, organ dy sfunctions 
and co -morbidities, as well as the patient's informed decision.
The median overall survival ( OS), for patients not achieving a CR is <1year, even with best 
palliative treatment. Even for patients who have received induction and consolidation 
treatment the OS and cure rate are poor: Over 60% will di e due to their disease within 
5years. The risk of leukemic relapse along with the poor prospects of long -term survival 
after a relapse calls for novel therapeutic strategies to maintain CR in AML .

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.AML  patients in CR who have been initial ly diagnosed with non-favorable genetics and 
either have received induction and consolidation treatment and are not candidates for 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (e.g. no donor available, not eligible/fit 
enough) or have received an all ogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have a very  
high risk to relapse. For those patients no standard therap y to maintain the CR is currently 
available. 
For refractory  or relapsed AML  patients , outside of treatment in clinical trials , re-induct ion 
followed b y allogen eic stem cell transplantation is the most common regimen . However 
many  are not eligible for such an intensive treatment .For those patients with refractory or 
relapsed AML ineligible for intensive treatment, or for those with refract ory or relapses 
disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, no approved or standard treatment is 
available. 
Evidence that targeting of CD33 can result in clinical benefit for patients suffering from 
AML  is provided by the unconjugated, humanized I gG1 monoclonal antibody  lintuzumab 
(SGN- 33, HuM195) which showed signs of clinical efficacy  as monotherapy  in a Phase I 
clinical trial in relapsed / refractory  AML patients with an objective response rate (ORR) 
of 17 % (R11-1481). Objective response was defined as either CR, CRi or PR .
Lintuzumab was also explored in a Phase I stud y in patients with acute promy elocy tic 
leukemia (APL) after remission induction. Multiple doses of lintuzumab could be 
administered safely  and appea red to eliminate minimal residual disease detectable b y RTPCR 
in some patients. ( R11-4695 )
Currently , major efforts arefocus edon the improvement of the therap y in these subgroups of 
patients with unfavo urable prognosis.
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
BI836858 is a full y human IgG1 antibod y specific for human CD33 which is Fc -engineered 
for increased binding to Fc RIIIa .Please see full details in latest version of Investigator’ s 
Brochure ( c02324887 -03).
CD33 is a my eloid differentiation antigen which is expressed on the cell surface of non-
malignant leukocy tes of the my eloid linea ge and with high frequen cy on malignant cells in 
AML , chronic m yeloid leukemia and m yelod ysplastic sy ndrome ( R11-1467 , R11-1468 , 
R11-1470 , R11-2960 ).In addition to expression on malignant m yeloid blast cells, CD33 
expression was reported for leukemic stem cells (R11-1469 ). For normal leukocy tes, CD33 
expression was reported for monocy tes, macrophages, dendri tic cells ,and to a lower exten t, 
granulocy tes (R11-1467 ),butnot for CD34+CD38-hematopoietic stem cells in the bone 
marrow ( R11-1469 ). Based on the expression profile of CD33, transient pharmacod ynamic 
effects of CD33 antibody treatment on CD33 positive normal cell t ypes may be expected .

BI 836858 i s Fc-engineered for increased binding to Fc RIIIa, which results in increased 
antibody  dependent cellular cy totoxicity  (ADCC) activity  of BI 836858 as compared to a 
non-Fc-engineered IgG1 -type of antibody . The ADCC activity  of BI 836858 was assessed on 
a panel of AM L-derived cell lines and primary  AML  cells andcompared to the ADCC 
activity  of lintuzumab, a humanized CD33 -specific antibody  which has been in clinical 
development for AML ( R11-1471 ).  
 
 
The CD33 antigen is known to internalize upon antibody  binding ( R11- 4256 ).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preliminary  data from this first -in-human dose escalation study  with BI 836858 (trial number 
1315.1) in pat ients with relapsed or refractory  acute my eloid leukemia investigating a weekl y 
dose (q1w) is available.  As of the data cut- off date 12 April 2016, 26 patients were treated 
with BI 836858, all with doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg, respectivel y. The most frequen t drug-
related AE Preferred Term (PT) was infusion -related reaction (IRR) in eleven out of 26 
patients (42 %). Adverse events considered a sign or sy mptom of an IRR by  the investigator 
included back pain, chest pain, chills, dy spnea, fever and h ypotension. All patients recovered 
from their IRRs with adequate sy mptom -oriented therapy . Drug -related transient increase of 
liver function tests was reported in four patients :one patient with grade 1 aspartate amino

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
New therapeutic strategies are needed to significantly  improve the prognosis of AM L patients 
with relapsed/refractory  disease , but also for AML patients in CR with a high risk to relapse . 
Recent successful developments of signal transduction inhibitors or antibodies targeting
specific molecules that are deemed important for the malignan t cell biology have spurred the 
search for other targets and respective antibodies.
CD33 is a valid target to treat patients with AML, as CD33 is expressed on themajority  of 
AML  cells (R11-1472 )and on leukemic stem cells, bu t not outside of the hematopoietic 
system (R11-1473 ). 
CD33 targeting approaches have been evaluated in clinical trials in AML  patients. 
Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (My lotarg®), an i mmunoconjugate of a CD 33mAb and 
calicheamic in, was approved by theFood and Drug Administration ( FDA )in 2000 for 
patients over the age of 60 with relapsed AML, or those who are not considered candidates 
for standard chemotherapy . In June 2010 M ylotarg®was withdrawn b y FDA request , due to a 
negative benefit risk assessment in a Phase IIItrial. As My lotarg is an immunconjugate of a 
CD33 mAb and a toxin, the MoA and also the safety  profile are different to BI 836858. 
Clinical data of relapsed/refractory  AML patients who were treated with the humanized 
CD33 IgG1 monoclonal antibody  (mAb) lintuzumab are published (R11- 1474 , R01-1267 , 
R11-1481 ).In these trials , administration of lintuzumab was safe and has shown signsof 
clinical efficacy  (ORR )of 17 % in a Phase I trial in relapsed / refractory  AML  (R11-1481 ).  
Lintuzumab was also explored in a Phase I stud y in patients with APL  after remission 
induction. Multiple doses of lintuzumab could be administered safel y and appeared to 
eliminate minimal residual disease detectable b y RTPCR in some patients. ( R11-4695 )
The clinical experience with lintuzumab supports the assumption that targeting CD33 with an 
IgG1 -type antibod y ma y translate into clinical benefit in patients with AML with an 
acceptable side effect profile. 
 
BI 836858 is a monoclonal antibody  which mechanistically  relies on effector -cell mediated
immune mechanisms, in particular ADCC (antibody  dependent cellular cy totoxicity ) and
ADCP (antibody  dependent cellular phagocy tosis). ADCC predominantly  depends on the
presence of natural killer (NK) cells and ADCP on the presence of m yeloid derived effector
cells (i.e. monocy tes and macrophages). In a recent publication, where NK cell phenot ype 
and function was assessed in 32 consecutive AML patients including 12 achieving complete 
remission, it was reported that NK cells in relapsed and refractory  AML patients have 
impaired functionality . It was also shown that phenoty pic and functional abnormalities of NK 
cells are partiall y restored in AML patients achieving a CR. ( R15-6192 ).

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.It is likel y that BI 836858 requires the presence of functional NK cells and monocytes to 
achieve clinical benefit in AML  patients. AML patients who have achieved a CR have an 
improved effector cell profile (N K cells and monocy tes) and may  have a higher likelihood to 
benefit from the pharmacological activity  of BI 836858.
 
 
 
 
 
 
This trial was the first administration of BI 836858 in humans.
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The primary  objective of this trial is to determine the max imum tolerated doses (MTD s) of 
BI836858.  BI836858 is a new biological entit y (NBE) and the MTD may not be r eached . 
To learn more about t he safet y and prel iminary  effica cy there will be an expansion cohort 
either atthe MTD or the highest tested dose (e.g. 320 mg). Secondary  objectives are to 
document the safety  and tolerability  of BI 836858,  
and to evaluate efficacy  (see Section 5 ).
2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Although considerable progress has been achieved in understanding the etiology  and biologic 
behavior of AML and the de velopment of more effective treatment regimens are ongoing ,

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.most patients with refractory or relapsed AML have a very  poor prognosis. Re-induction 
followed b y allogen eic stem cell transplant ation is the most common regimen for refractory  
or relapsed AML patients, however many are not eligible for such an intensive treatment. For 
those patients with refractory or relapsed AML ineligible for intensive treatment, or for t hose 
with refractory  or relapsed disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, no ap proved or 
standard treatment is available. 
AML  patients in CR who have been initially  diagnosed with non-favorable genetics and 
either have received induction and consolidation treatment and are not candidates for 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transp lantation (e.g. no donor available, not eligible/fit 
enough) or have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have a very  
high risk to relapse. For those patients no standard therap y to maintain the CR is currently 
available. 
BI 8368 58 is a monoclonal antibody , which specifically  targets CD33. Targeting CD33 in 
patients with AML  may  potentially  offer a benefit to those patients since CD33 is expressed 
on AML  blasts in the majority  of AML patients (see Section 1.2 ).In vitro , BI836858 is a 
potent inducer of ADCC, which results in cy tolysis of AML -derived cell lines and primary  
AML  blasts from peripheral blood and bone marrow. In the clinical setting, these effects may  
potentially  result in anti -leukemic activ ity as a monotherap y, but also offer potential for 
combination with other drugs in patients with AML.
CD33 is not known to be expressed outside of the hematopoietic sy stem. The anticipated side 
effect profile of BI 836858 based on the CD33 expression profi le comprises predominantly  
hematologic adverse events such as neutropenia . These hematological adverse events are 
frequentl y reported in patients with hematological diseases and may be due to the underlying 
disease, the treatment or both. The preclinical s afety  assessments for BI 836858 have 
revealed TNF- alpha and INF -gamma release, suggesting a potential for infusion reactions. 
Clinical data from 26 patients are available from this first in human study  1315.1.  
 
Infusion reactions were the most frequently observed drug related adverse event in this first 
in human study  and is newly  classified as a listed (expected) adverse event. I nfusion -related 
reactions are frequentl y observed with monoclonal antibodies in hematologica l indications, 
and signs/s ymptoms of IRRs reported for BI 836858 are in line with AEs reported for other 
antibodies approved in hematology indications. To mitigate the risk for IRRs, protocol 
specified precautions must be adhered to, i.e. premedication, ra te-controlled infusion

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This trial will be performed in two separate patient populations: 1 ) Patients diagnosed with 
relapsed or refractory  AML  who have failed at least one prior line of therapy  and 2) patients 
with AML  who are in complete remission (CR) with a high risk to relapse. It will be 
performed in an open, non- randomized, 3+3 design followed by  an expansion cohort. A cy cle 
will comprise of 14 day s. 
For patients with refractory  or relapsed AML , one cy cle is 14 day s with two administrations 
of BI 836858 (i.e. administrations on Day s 1 and 8).  Patients with clinical benefit, defined b y 
the International Working Group (IWG) as having objective response (partial remission (PR) 
or complete remission (CR) or comp lete remission with incomplete blood recovery  (CRi)) or 
subjective response (in the absence of objective response) after 8 administrations and who are 
tolerating the infusions, may  continue until progressive disease (PD) and as long as neither 
patient nor Investigator requests treatment discontinuation .
For AML patients in CR, one cy cle is 14 day s with one administration of BI 836858 (i.e. 
administrations on Day s 1)inCycles 1, 2 and 3.  From the 4thcycleonwards, patients will 
receive monthly  (every  second cy cle) infusions of BI 836858 (i.e. 4thinfusion on Cycle 5 Day  
1, 5thinfusion on Cycle 7 Day  1) for overall up to one y earof treatment unless these patients 
relapse or infusions are not tolerated.   
To determine separate MTD s for each patient popul ation , cohort dose escalation will be 
conducted following the 3+3 design for the refractory  or relapsed AML patients and the 
patients with AML  in CR with high risk to relapse , respectivel y.  The dose level will be 
escalated with each new cohort until at le ast one out of three patients of a cohort experiences 
a dose limiting toxicity  (DLT; for definition see Section 5.2.1.1 )during the first two cy cles
(DLT evaluation period) .  If exactly one out of the three patients of the co hort experiences a 
DLT, three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level.  If none of the three 
additional patients experiences a DLT, then the cohort dose escalation will be continued b y 
treating the next three patients at the next higher dose level.   If at least two out of up to six 
patients at a dose level experience a DLT, the MTD has been exceeded and the dose will be 
deescalated until a dose level is reached in which at most one DL T out of six patients is 
observed ( R01-0028 ).  The MTD is defined as the dose of BI 836858 that is one dose cohort 
below the dose at which two or more out of six patients experienced DLT.  At the maximum 
tolerated dose, no more than one patient out of six patients may  experience D LT, i.e., the 
MTD is defined as the highest dose studied for which the incidence of dose -limiting toxicity  
is no more than 17% (i.e. 1/6 patients) during the first two cy cles.
Patients are considered to have completed the first two cy cles if they  have reached end of 
cycle 2 and have received all planned administrations of BI 836858 (i.e. 4 administrations for 
patients with relapsed or refractory  AML and 2 administrations for patients in CR).

3 patients,  open next cohort
2 6 If there is at least one new DLT in 
additional 3 patients, MTD is 
exceeded, expansion co hort opened at 
next lower dose level.
During the dose escalation phase, each patient will receive up to 2 repeated treatment cy cles
before DLT assessment . 
For both patient populations the dose is planned to be escalated in cohorts at pre- defined dose 
levels based on a multiplication factor of 2. The dose levels are 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 
160 mg, and 320 mg as outlined in Section 4.1.3 . However, for AML patients in CR, the dose 
escalation will start with the 40 mg dose coh ortand follow the same dose escalation levels .
Intermediate dose levels anddose levels higher than 320 mg may be investigated if agreed 
upon between Investigator and Sponso r.  
After definition of the MTD, it is planned to enroll an expansion cohort of 12 patients to 
better characterize the safety  of BI 836858. In case no MTD is reached up to the highest 
planned dose (e.g., 320 mg), 12 additional patients will be treated with each respective 
schedule at thehighest test dose (i.e., 320mg)of BI 836858. 
The primary  anal ysis will take place when all patients from the cohort dose escalation and 
dose expansion cohort shave had a minimum of 4 cy cles or have discontinued from the trial 
prior to reaching end of cy cle 4 dueto meeting the criteria for withdrawa l as outlined in 
Section 3.3.4.1 .
3.1.1 Administrative structure of the trial
Boehringer Ingelheim is the Sponsor of this trial. The Coordinating Investigator will be 
 participating Investigators will be phy sicians experienced and specialized 
in the treatment of AML and in the conduct of Phase I trials.

there will be di scussions of safet y assessments, recommendations for cohort dose escalation , 
to reach a consensus on DL T,and whether to continue or modify the trial.   
All safet y laboratory  analy ses will be performed locally  at each clinic site in the schedule 
outlined in the Flow Chart s. All of the biomarker anal yses will be performed at  
 with the exception of cy tokine analy ses which will be performed in locations

3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CH OICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP
The primary  objective of this trial is to determine the MTD for both patient populations 
separately . The most important secondary  objective is to assess the safety  of BI 836858.  This 
can be achieved b y an open label, single arm desig n without a control group.
Adult patients with refractory /relapsed AML are considered eligible for this trial.  
Relapsed AML is defined as recurrent disease after prior remission of an y duration. 
Refractory  disease is defined as failure to achieve remissi on to most recently administered 
therap y. Patients with primary refractory disease, defined as failure to achieve remission to 
initial therapy , are eligible. Ty picall y patients with primary refractory disease are defined as 
refractory  after failure of two cycles of intensive induction. Patients with failure of a single 
cycle of induction are eligible for this trial if they  refuse to receive a second induction cy cle 
or if they  are not candidates for a second intensive induction cycle. Patients receiving 
hypomethy lating agents as initial induction should receive at least two cy cles of induction 
before designation as refractory .
AML  patients in CR who have been initially  diagnosed with non-favorable genetics have a 
very high risk to relapse. Eligible patients f or this trial should either have received induction 
and consolidation treatment and are not candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (e.g. no donor available, not eligible/fit enough) or have received allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For those patients no standard therapy to maintain 
the CR is currently  available.
These AML patient groups were selected for inclusion in this trial, because these patients 
constitute groups with unfavourable prognosis for whom curren tly no satisfactory  standard 
treatment exists.
The trial design will follow a 3+3 design with cohort dose escalation and de -escalation for 
both patient groups . Once the MTD has been defined, an expansion cohort of 12 patients is 
planned to be enrolled to b etter characterize the safety  profile and tolerability  of the MTD. In 
case no MTD is reached up to the highest planned dose (e.g., 320 mg), 12 additional patients 
will be treated with the respective schedule of the highest tested dose (e.g., 320 mg) of         
BI 836858.  This trial design is accepted for hematology  Phase I stu dies.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.For patients with refractory  or relapsed AML, the f irst efficacy  assessment via bone marrow 
aspirate will be performed after 2 cy cles (4 administrations).  Subsequent disease a ssessment 
will be performed after 4 cycles (8 administrations) and at the discretion of the Investigator .  
For AML patients in CR, disease status will be followed up on a regular basis with peripheral 
blood count and a bone marrow assessment will be perfo rmed if suspicion of relapse. Patients 
with a MRD marker will be followed up on this marker as well, however this is explorative.  
Intra -patient dose escalation will be allowed for selected patients in case the next higher dose 
cohort is free of DLT and c onsidered safe. This is not considered a safet y risk because it will 
be restricted to patients who have tolerated at least three cyclesof BI 836858 at the time of 
dose escalation and may  offer a potential benefit to patients enrolled at a lower dose.
Each patient will be closely  monitored for infusion -related reactions, as this is a potential 
side-effect for mAbs.
Safety  assessments will be performed at all visits during the treatment phase.
The trial shall allow the investigation of BI 836858 in AML  with regard to safet y and the 
definition of the optimal dose for the future clinical development program in this disease .
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
Approximately  50patients with relapsed or refractory  AML and about 35AML  patients in 
CR with high risk to relapse will be screened . Of these patients, approximately  36 with 
refractory  or relapsed AML  and approximately  27 patients with AML  in CR with high risk to 
relapse will be included in this trial from a target of 5 sites. Each site will screen a target of 
about 10 patients.
A log of all patients included into the study  (i.e. having given informed consent) will be 
maintained in the investigator site file ( ISF)at the investigational site irrespective of whether 
they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for study entry
Patients with relapsed or refractory  AML as defined according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) criteria will be eligible for this trial (see Section 3.2 ),
AND
Patients with AML  in CR with high risk to relapse will be eligible for this trial (see also 
Section 3.2 ). AML in CR with high risk to relapse is defined as follows:
a)AML  patients with non -favorable genetics (according to European LeukemiaNet 
(ELN) classification) that are in CR after having received induction and consolidation 
chemotherap y and are not candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (SCT) (e.g., no donor available, not eligible/fit enough)

3.3.4.1 Removal of individual patients
An individual patient is to be withdrawn from the trial if:
The patient withdraws consent. Patients are free to discontinue their participation in 
this t rial at any  time without the need to justify  the decision.
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs which may  interfere with the 
investigational product (please refer to Section 4.2.2 ).
The patient is no longer able to parti cipate for other medical reasons (e.g. adverse 
events unrelated to therapy  or disease progression, concomitant diagnoses, pregnancy , 
surgery  or administrative reasons). The Investigator may also stop a patient's 
participation if the patient is no longer ab le to attend trial visits.
A patient can be withdrawn from the trial after discussion between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor if eligibility  criteria are violated and/or the patient fails to comply with the protocol.
All withdrawals will be documented and the reason for withdrawal recorded and discussed, as 
necessary , in the final report of the trial. As soon as a refractory  or relapsed AML  patient is 
withdrawn from the trial treatment , the end of active treatment (EOT) visit has to be 
performed if feasibl e. For patients with AML  in CR, as soon as a patient is withdrawn from 
the trial treatment, the end of active treatment (EOT) visit and the End of Residual Effect 
Period (REP) visit (EoR visit) must be performed if feasible.  Every  effort should be made to
follow -up with patients in case an adverse event (AE) is still ongoing at the time of 
withdrawal.   If a patient is withdrawn from the trial due to consent withdrawal , no further 
visits will be completed and no further trial data will be collected. However , if information 
about survival status is available in the public domain , then the Investigator is requested to 
report this information in the eCRF.
A patient has to discontinue trial drug administration in case:
A DLT occurs which does not recover to a de gree that allows treatment continuation 
(see Section 4.1.4 ).
Progressive disease (PD) or any other concomitant diagnosis/symptom develops 
resulting in an indication to start any  other therapy for AML, including deterioration 
of general condition.
Patients not completing the first two cy cles (with all planned BI 836858 administrations) for 
reasons other than DLT will be replaced.
3.3.4.2 Discontinuation of the trial by  the sponsor
Boehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discon tinue the trial overall or at a particular trial 
site at any  time for the following reasons:

4.1 TREATMENTS TO BE ADM INISTERED
BI 836858 will be administ ered as rate-controlled intravenous infu sion. In case a patient 
experiences an adverse event during the infusion, the duration of the infusion may  be 
expanded until the use -by date and use -by time indicated on the label is reached.  The actual 
duration of the infusion needs to be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF )
including actual start and end time, actual time points for interruption and restart of the 
infusion and the actual infusion rates.
Adverse events during the infusion will be tho roughl y documented and characterized to allow 
differentiation between infusion-related reactions ( R10-4428 , R10-4517 ).
4.1.1 Identity of BI investigational product and comparator product
The chara cteristics of the test product are below.
Substance (INN): BI 836858
Pharmaceutical form:  Solution for infusion after dilution
Source: Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG
Unit strength: 10 mg/mL  (vials with 10mL )
Daily  dose: See Section 4.1.3
Duration of use: Single administration every  7, 15, or 29 days
(depending onpatient population)
Route of administration: Intravenous
Posology : Rate controlled infusion
(Volume:  250 mL )
The first and second infusion will be started at a rate of 10 mL/h. The infusion rate should be 
increased every  30 (+/ -10) minutes by  10 mL/h to a maximum of 80 mL /h as long as 
tolerated b y the patient. Infusion should not exceed 8 hours. If considered safe b y the 
Investigator, the st epwise increase of infusion rate during the third and subsequent infusions 
may be faster or steps may  be omitted, but the maximum infusion rate must not exceed 120 
mL/h. If s ymptoms of an infusion -related reaction occur, the infusion should be temporaril y 
stopped. Upon recovery , it should be infused at 50% of the rate at which the reaction 
occurred and should not be dose escalated from this dose for at least 30 minutes. Lower rates 
may be selected if clinically  indicated. Depending on the time of occurrence and the severity  
of the reaction, the investigator may  consider administering additional supportive medication, 
e.g. corticosteroids. A stepwise re -increase of the infusion rate to a maximum of 80 mL /h is 
possible. For medical reasons, i n case a patient experiences an adverse event during the 
infusion, the duration of the infusion may  be expanded until the use -by date and use -by time 
indicated on the label is reached. The actual duration of the infusion s and infusion steps need 
to be documented in the eCRF including actual start and end time, actual time points for 
interruption and restart of the infusion and the actual infusion rates.

Not applicable.  This is a single -arm, open -label, cohort dose esca lation trial.
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
BI 836858 will be administered as a rate -controlled intravenous infusion every  7 day sto
refractory  or relapsed AML  patients.  
For AML patients in CR, the first three administrations will be given every second week, on 
day 1 of Cy cles 1, 2 and 3.  From the 4thadministration onwards, patients will receive 
monthly  (every  second cy cle) infusions of BI 836858 (i.e. 4thinfusion on Cycle 5 Day  1, 5th
infusion on Cycle 7 Day  1…) for overall up to 12 months oftreatment unless these patients 
relapse or infusions are not tolerated.
Patients with refractory  or relapsed AML have a high medical need and a bad prognosis . To 
treat this patient population with a s ub saturating dose is not wa rrantedand therefore a 
starting dose close to the full saturation of all CD33 sites is chosen. The starting fixed dose of 
10 mg which is a dose level expected to provide near to the full saturation of all CD33 sites at 
maximum measured plasma concentration (C max)based on estimate d receptor occupancy  (i.e. 
94.3% estimated CD33 occupancy ). For lintuzumab, a CD33 monoclonal antibody , in a 
Phase I trial no MTD was reached up to 8mg/kg/week ( R11-1481 ).A fixed dose regimen was 
chosen instead of a dose per m2based a recent publication by  Wang et al. The individual and 
popu lation performance of body  size-based and fixed dosing in adults were compared for 12 
oncology  approved mAbs (R10-6267 ).  Although both dose regimens demonstr ated similar 
performance, the fixed dose was recommended since it offered advantages in the ease of dose 
preparation and a lower chance of dosing errors.
For details please refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure, Section 5.3.6 ( c02324887 -03).
The dose is planned to be escalated in cohorts at pre- defined dose levels based on a 
multiplication factor of 2. The dose levels are 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, and 320 
mg. Intermediate dose levels and dose levels higher than 320 mg may  be investigated if 
agreed upon between Investigator and Sponsor.  In an ongoing Phase I study  BI 836858 is 
administered to lower risk MDS patients every  14 day s. In the 20 and 40 mg cohort no DLT 
occurred and the 80mg cohort is currentl y ongoing. The dose escalation in AML patients in 
CR will begin with infusions at the dose level of 40mg.  The dose will be escalated to the 
next pre -defined or intermediate dose level s as needed. 
When a cohort dose escalation is to be performed, the data of all previous dose cohorts will 
be reviewed and discussed between the participating Investigator s and the Sponsor .This 
assessment will determine if each patient population is able to continue treatment with         
BI 836858.
During the cohort dose escalation phase, enrolment into the first dose cohort (10 mg) will be 
allowed at the earliest 7 day s after the first administration of  BI 836858 between patient 1

to 6 patient s, a one week observation period must be followed between the first 
administration of BI 836858 and the start of the subsequent patient. For subsequent cohorts 
(i.e., 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, and 320 mg ), consecutive screening is allowed; however, 
there has to be an interval of at least 3 day s between the 1stadministration of BI 836858 for
each patient. 
Enrolment into the next higher dose cohort is allowed after the previous dose cohort was 
found to be safe for the initial administration for all patie nts in this cohort (e.g. at least 28 
days after the first administration of drug in the last patient entered into the cohort).
Once the MTD for one of the patient populations is defined, a dose for treatment of the 
expansion cohort in this patient populati on will be determined, which will not exceed the 
MTD.  In case no MTD is reached up to the highest tested dose (e.g. 320 mg), 12 additional 
patients will be treated with the respective schedule of the highest tested dose (e.g. 320 mg)
of BI 836858 in the expansion cohort . During treatment of the expansion cohort, new patients 
may be enrolled at any  time.

4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Prior to inclusion of a new patient during the cohort dose escalation phase, the Investigator
has to confirm the actual dose tier of BI 836858 for the patient with the Sponsor who 
oversees the cohort dose escalation steps and the safet y data of patients from all trial sites.  
BI836858 will be admi nistered as an intravenous infusion under the supervision of the 
Investigator or designated personnel.
BI 836858 may  be administered at any  time during the day .  However, to  
 it is recommended to 
start the infusion during the morning hours.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.For refractory  or relapsed AML  patients :  BI 836858 will be administered as weekl y i.v. 
infusions in 14-day cycles(i.e., Day s 1 and 8; 2 infusions per cy cle).
For AML patients in CR : the first three administrations will be given once every  second week 
on day one of 14 -day Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (i.e., Day s 1, 15 and 29).  From the 4thadministration 
onwards, patients will receive monthly  (every  second cy cle) infusions of BI 836858 (i.e. 4th
administration on Cycle 5 Day  1, 5thadministration on Cycle 7 Day  1…) for overall up to 12 
months of treatment.
Premedication
Premedication to prevent infusion- related reactions is obligatory  30 minutes (up to 120 min 
before start of administration of BI 8 36858 is permissible) prior to the first three
administration sof BI 836858, unless a contraindication for premedication exists, and should 
include:
Acetaminophen/Paracetamol 650 mg - 1000 mg p.o., or equivalent
Antihistamine p.o. or i.v., equivalent to Di phenh ydramine 50 mg i.v.
Glucocorticoid i.v., equivalent to prednisolone 100mg
For patients with refractory  or relapsed AML : 
IfBI 836858 has been well tolerated without signs of infusion -related re actions in the first 
administration, glucocorticoid prem edication may  be reduced to a do se equivalent to 50 mg 
prednisolone for the second through fourth administration s,and in case this is well tolerated 
reduce the steroids with the 5th infusion (25 mg with the 5thand 0 mg with the 6thinfusion.)
For AML p atients in CR :
If BI 836858 has been well tolerated without signs of infusion- related reactions in the first 
administration, glucocorticoid premedication may be reduced to a dose equivalent to 50 mg 
prednisolone for the second administration , and in case t his is well tolerated steroids can be 
omitted with the 3rd infusion. 
For both patient populations, however, in case an administration of BI 836858 was not well 
tolerated, the premedication with prednisolone can be re -escalated up to 100 mg.
Retreatment                                                                                                                         
Before the next administration of BI 836858, adverse events and safety  laboratory  will be 
assessed.  To continue treatment with further administrations, all of the following criteria 
must be met:
Refractory  or relapsed AML  patients
(1) Neutrophils ≥500 / μL (0.5 x 109/L) and platelets ≥25,000 / μL (25 x 109/L), unless 
CTCAE Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocy topenia was preexistent prior to trial 
entry. Patients with active leukemia who go from Grade 3 neutropenia to Grade 4

provided that post -transfusion platelet count is at least 20,000/ µLbefore therap y is 
given.
(2) Acceptable tolerability (in case of an AE at the planned start of a further 
administration, patients may  continue therap y only after recovery  to a level which 
would allow further therapy , i.e. CTCAE grade 1 or pre -treatment value); no 
febrile neutropenia (≥38.5°C and ANC <1000/µL ) and no uncontrolled infection. 
Patients who do not meet these criteria for furthe r therap y should be discussed 
with the TCM and/or the Coordinating Investigator and may  be eligible to 
continue if the toxicity  is not clinically  significant.
AML  patients in CR
(1) Neutrophils ≥750 /μL (0.75 x 109/L) and platelets ≥50,000 / μL (50 x 109/L). 
(2) Acceptable tolerabilit y (in case of an AE at the planned start of a further 
administration, patients may  continue therap y only after recovery  to a level which 
would allow further therapy , i.e. CTCAE grade 1 or baseline value.)
(3) Patients with GvHD, with a CTC AE grade 1 or 2 and taking steroids ,may 
continue further administration.  GvHD patients with a steroid -refractory  (≥2 
mg/Kg) CTCAE grade 3 or higher, independent of receiving steroids, should be 
discontinued from study .
In case criteri a1 and 2 are not fulfilled, blood counts and/or the adverse event should be 
re-evaluated for up to three weeks.  In case of a t reatment delay ,the Sponsor must be 
notified. If criterion 1 is not fulfilled and the patient has<5% blasts in the bone marrow, 
absence of m yelod ysplastic changes, and/or absence of evidence of disease by  flow 
cytometry  in the bone marrow then no further treatment should be administered until 
discussion with the Sponsor.
Administration of the trial drug has to be stopped temporaril y in case of a DLT (see 
Section 5.2.1.1 ).  Patients may  continue therap y only  after recovery  from the DLT to a 
CTCAE level which allows further therap y based on Investigator assessment and only  with a 
reduced dose of BI 836858.  The new dose of BI 836858 must be finally  agreed on between 
the Sponsor and the Investigator.  The reduced dose will be va lid for all following treatment 
cycles in the individual patient.  A reduction of the dose will be allowed only  once for an 
individual patient during the whole trial.  In case a patient experiences a second episode of 
DLT with the reduced BI 836858 dose, t he treatment has to be permanently  discontinued.  
Likewise, treatment has to be discontinued in case the DLT is not reversible.
Intra- patient dose escalation
Intra -patient dose escalation may  be considered in agreement between investigator and 
sponsor for selected patients. I t is restricted to patients who have received at least 3treatment 
cyclesand tolerate the treatment well at the time of dose escalation. Intra -patient dose 
escalation can only  be performed at a time when the next higher dose cohort has been

For patients with refractory  or relapsed AML, r esponse will be assessed according to the 
criteri a from the IWGbased on laboratory  data from the peripheral blood , bone marrow 
examination, clinical examination (at the end of each cy cle),at the evaluation for further 
treatment -visit andthe EOT- visit.Bone marrow examination will be performed before t he 
Cycle 3 and Cy cle5 (5th and 9th administration of BI 836858) (i.e., BM performed on Day  1 
(+/-1) of cy cles 3 and 5 and treatment started on Day  1 (up to +3) of cy cles 3 and 5) and at 
the discretion of the Investigator , e.g. in case clinical and laborat ory examinations of 
peripheral blood demonstrate that a CR has been achieved, or for assessment of persistent 
neutropenia, anemia or thrombocy topenia. 
For AML patients in CR, response will be assessed clinically  and in the peripheral blood (on 
Day 1 of e ach cy cle). In the case of suspected relapse based on peripheral blood counts a 
bone marrow examination will be performed. 
Assessment and definition of bestoverall response
Response will be evaluated according to the following criteria (modified from th e IWG
criteria, R06-0452 ):
Complete remission (CR)
Morphologically  leukemia free state (i.e. bone marrow with <5% blasts b y 
morphologic criteria and no blasts with Auer rods, no evidence of extramedullary  
leukemia) and absolu te neutrophil count ≥1000 /μL and platelets ≥ 100,000 /μL .  
Patient must be independent of transfusions (no transfusion for 1 week prior to the 
assessment).
Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)
All of the above criteria for CR must be met, except tha t absolute neutrophils 
<1000 /μLor platelets <100,000 /μL  in the blood.  
Partial remission (PR)
All of the criteria for CR must be met, except that leukemic blasts in the bone marrow 
may range from 5 to 25% as long as the count has decreased b y at least 50% from 
pre-study  treatment, or <5% blasts in the presence of Auer rods or abnormal 
morphology .
Stable disease (SD)
Patient alive with no CR, CRi, PR or PD.

Patient survives > 7 day s following completion of initial 2 treatment c ycles (e.g. 
28days) with persistent leukemia in the last peripheral blood smear or bone marrow 
(>25% blasts), or with persistent extramedullary  disease, but without further clinical 
deterioration due to leukemia or increase of blast population in the bone marrow or 
peripheral blood.
Resistant disease: Patient survives > 7 day s post -course of treatment; persistent 
leukemia in blood or bone marrow .

with aplastic bone marrow
Indeterminate cause: Patients who die < 7 day s post therap y. Patients who die > 7 
days post therapy  with no peripheral blood blasts, but no bone marrow examination .
Patients who do not complete the first course of therap y.
Morphologic relapse (recurrence) : Reappearance of blasts post -CR or CRi in 
peripheral blood or bone marrow. That is, b one marrow leukemic blasts ≥ 5% or 
reappearance of blasts in the blood not attributable to any other cause (e.g. bone 
marrow regeneration), or development of extramedulla ry disease.
Progressive disease (PD)
Patient survives > 7 day s following completion of initial 2 treatment cy cles (e.g. 
28days) with increase of blast population in the bone marrow or peripheral blood by  
>50% or aggravation or new development of extramedu llary disease or further 
deterioration or death due to leukemia.  Patients with a global deterioration of health 
status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of PD at that 
time should be classified as having ‘ clinicall y progress ive disease’.  Every  effort 
should be made to document the objective PD even after discontinuation of treatment.
Definition of best overall response
Best overall response is defined as the best overall response (CR, CRi, PR, TF, PD or not 
evaluable in thi s order) recorded since first administration of BI 836858.

patient has received at least 2 administrations of BI 836858 and reached end of 
cycle 2).
 
As this trial is the first in human use of BI 836858, the primary  objective is to determine the 
MTD of BI 836858 and assess the safet y of the drug in humans.  For details on determination 
of MTD, please refer to Section 3.1 , Section 5.2.1.1 and Section 7.3.1 .
The safet y of B I 836858 will be assessed b y a descriptive anal ysis of incidence and intensity  
of adverse events (AE) graded according to theCTCAE version 4.0, the incidence of DLT, 
laboratory  data and results of phy sical examination.
The Sponsor will review the safet y data with the participating Investigators at regular 
intervals and as ad hoc if needed.
The safet y endpoints will be assessed in a descriptive way  without confirmatory  anal yses.
5.2.1.1 Dose limiting toxicity  (DLT) for refractory  or relapsed AML patients
DLT is defined as any  non-disease -related non -hematological AE of CTCAE grade 3 or 
higher. Expected non- hematological disease related AE ´s such as complications resulting 
from h aematological A Es include:
bleeding and complications from bleeding due to thromb ocytopenia as defined by  the 
investigator 
infection and complications from infections due to neutropenia as defined by the 
investigator

Infusion- related reactions (IRRs, CTCAE grade 3 or higher) associated with the 
administration of BI 836858 should be reported as Adverse Event of Special I nterest (AESI, 
refer to Section 5.2.2.1 ), but will not be regarded as a DLT.  The exception is anaph ylaxis
which occurs despite premedication with glucocorticoid or which does not resolve with 
glucocorticoid (i.e. such cases of anaph ylaxis will be regarded as a DLT).
Infection will not constitute a DLT unless it is felt that the infection resulted from 
unexpectedly  compl icated my elosuppression; degree of severit y and/or duration as assessed 
by the Investigator . 
Hematological AEs, e.g. neutropenia, thrombocy topenia and anemia are frequently  
pre-existing in AML patients and are therefore AEs not considered as DLT. Failure to 
recover neutrophil count (ANC>500/uL) or p latelet count (>25000/uL) at the first bone 
marrow evaluation after 2 cy cles of BI 836858 in patients with < 5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, absence of m yelodysplastic changes, and/or absence of evidence of diseas e by flow 
cytometry  in the bone marrow will be considered a DLT. For patients with >5% blasts, 
myelodysplastic changes, or evidence of disease by  flow cy tometry /cytogenetics, failure to 
recover neutrophil or platelet count may  not be considered DLT as thi s could be the result of 
persistent disease. 
Patients who have not completed at least 4 administrations (2 cy cles) of BI 836858 due to BI 
836858 related toxicity  will be considered as a DLT.
5.2.1.2 Dose limiting toxicity  (DLT) for AML patients in CR
DLT is defined as any  non-disease -related AE of CTCAE grade 3 or higher. Patients in 
remission are not expected to have disease -related AEs.  In case of an y hematological AE of 
CTCAE grade 3 or higher, relapse of AML has to be excluded. Infusion -related reacti ons 
(IRRs) associated with the administration of BI 836858 should be reported as Adverse Events 
of Special Interest (AESI, refer to Section 5.2.2.1 ), but will not be regarded as a DLT.  The 
exception is anaphy laxis which occu rs despite premedication with glucocorticoid or which 
does not resolve with glucocorticoid (i.e. such cases of anaph ylaxis will be regarded as a 
DLT).
Occurrence of and/or worsening of GvHD will not be considered as a DLT; however, these 
cases will be rev iewed carefull y during the safet y assessment meetings.
AML  patients in CR who have not completed at least 2 administrations (2 cy cles) of BI 
836858 due to BI 836858 related toxicity  will be considered as a DLT.
Once each patient of a cohort has completed 2 treatment cy cles of BI 836858 all available

5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.2.1 Definitions of AEs 
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or d isease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may  arise 
from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from 
occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off -
label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which:
results in death,
is life -threatening, this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe.
requires inpatient hospitalisation or 
prolongation of existing h ospitalisation,
results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity , or
is a con genital anomal y / birth defect, or
is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgment which may jeopardise the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the above definitions.
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be consider ed serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be

patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or 
development of dependency  or abuse. Any  suspected transmission via a medicinal product of 
an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.
AEs considered “Alway s Serious ”
Every  new occurrence of cancer of new histology  must be reported as a serious event 
regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the 
cancer.
Cancers of new histolo gy and exacerbations of existing cancer must be reported as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the 
cancer .
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical E vents, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by  their nature, can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as given 
above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the RDC sy stem . A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided to y ou upon request. These events should 
alway s be reported as SAEs as described above.
Adverse events o f special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESI 
need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE, please see above.
The following are considered as AESIs:
infusion -related reactions (CTCAE grade 3 or higher),
any event that qualifies for DLT ,and
hepatic injury (DILI) .
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  (DILI)is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  
parameters: 
an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN combined with an elevat ion of total 
bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
marked peak aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF. 
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab res ults 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the Investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI check list should be followed
Intensit y of AEs
The intensity  of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the CRF according to the 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE , version 4.0, R09-2850 ).
Causal relationship of AEs
The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event. An adverse 
reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised b y the fact that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected. 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relat ionship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
•The event is consis tent with the known pharmacology  of the drug 
•The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
•A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
•Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
•No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
•The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
•An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
•No plaus ible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
conc erned)
•Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despite removing the original trigger.

situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
•Disappearance of the event even though the study  drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
5.2.2.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
AE Collection
The Investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  the 
Investigator:
From signing the informed consent onwards through the Res idual Effect Period 
(REP), until individual patient’s end of trial: 
All AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESI s. 
However, if an individual patient discontinues trial medication prematurel y but stay s 
in the trial (i.e. if further visits incl. teleph one visits, or vital status assessments are 
planned) from then on and until the individual patient’s end of the trial the 
Investigator must report related SAEs and related AESI s. 
After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
The Investigator does not ne ed to activel y monitor the patient for AEs but should only  
report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the I nvestigator may  become 
aware of.
The rules for Adverse Event Reporting exemptions (see below in paragraph “Exemptions to 
(S)AE Reporting”) still apply .

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.The REP is defined as 30 days after th e last trial medication application. All AEs which 
occurred through the treatment phase and throughout the REP will be considered as “on 
treatment ,”please see Section 7.3. 3. Events which occurred after the REP will be consider ed 
as “post-treatment ”events.
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
sponsor’s unique entry point (country  specific contact details will be provided in the I SF). 
The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions 
the Investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not r eplace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
CRF pages and the BI SAE form. The Investigator should determine the causal relationship 
to the trial medication and any  possible interactions between the investigational drug(s) and a 
Non-Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP) / Auxiliary  Medicinal Product (AMP) .
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the CRF and SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  the Investigator.
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed 
up until they  have resolved, have been sufficiently  characterised, or no further information 
can be obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare cases pregnancy  may  occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled into this 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the Investigator must report immediately (within 24 
h) a potential drug exposure during pregnancy (DEDP) in a fe male patient or in a partner to a 
male patient to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country -specific contact details will be provided 
in the ISF). The Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used.

followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form 
for Clinical Trials (Part B). 
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an a ccompanying SAE, only 
the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. If 
there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy then the SAE has to be reported on the SAE form 
in addition. 
The ISF will contain the Pregna ncy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B). 
Exemptions to (S)AE Reporting 
Disease Progression in oncology  trials is a study  endpoint for analy sis of efficacy , and as such is 
exempted from being reported as an SAE . Progression of the patient' s underly ing malignancy  will 
be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF as part of efficacy data collection only and will 
not be reported on the SAE Form. It will therefore not be entered in the safety database (Adverse 
Reactions Information System g lobal, ARISg) and hence not get expeditiously reported. Death 
due to disease progression is also to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page and not on the 
SAE Form. 
Examples of exempted events of PD may be:
Progression of underlying malignancy (Progress ive disease [PD]): if PD is clearly 
consistent with the suspected progression of AML as defined by the respective response 
criteria. 
Hospitalization/Procedures due solely to the progression of underlying malignancy (PD) 
Clinical sy mptoms and/or signs of progression (without confirmation by objective criteria 
e.g. imaging, clinical measurement): If the symptom can exclusively be determined to be 
due to the progression of the underlying malignancy and does meet the expected pattern 
of progression for the di sease under study. 
However, when there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the trial drug and the 
progression of the underlying malignancy, the event must be reported as an (S)AE on the SAE 
Form and on the eCRF.

indicated (e.g. treatment with vitamin K antagonists)
Urine pH, glucose, ery throcy tes, leukocy tes, protein, nitrite will be 
analysed by dipstick and reported as semiquantitative 
measurements. In case of pathological findings, further 
evaluation should be performed and results documented.
Pregnancy  test A serum pregnancy  test needs to be obtained at the time 
points indicated in the Flow Chart in patients of childbearing 
potential. 
An additional safet y lab will be collected on day  2 of Cy cle 1 (i.e., 24 hours after the first 
administration of BI 836858). Other lab tests to be included: haptoglobin, direct antiglobulin
test, bilirubin (direct and indirect) and free hemoglobin . Non pre -existing abnormal 
laboratory  values (CTCAE Grade 3 or higher) will be followed up every  48 hours until these 
laboratory  values are back to at least CTCAE Grade 1.
In case an administration is delay ed due to an AE, the patient should visit the site at least 
once a week for asse ssment of safety laboratory  and AEs. More frequent visits may  be 
appropriate as assessed by  the Investigator .
 
 
  
 
5.2.4 Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead resting ECG will be performed in all patients according to the schedule in the Flow 
Chart s.  The ECG will be assessed for pathological results (to be recorded as either

5.2.5.1 Vital signs
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and bod y temperature) will be recorded at every  visit 
during screening, tr eatment (including the EOT visit) and follow- up. Additional time points 
for blood pressure and heart rate at the day of administration of BI 836858 are: prior to the 
start of premedication, prior to the start of BI 836858 infusion, and in 30 (±10) minute 
intervals throughout the course of the infusion of BI 836858 and 60 (±10) minutes after the 
end of the infusion, thereafter every  4-8 hours until at least 24 hours after start of the
infusion . In case of an infusion -related reaction, the Investigator should decide whether to 
intensify  or prolong monitoring of vital signs of the patient.
Beginning with infusion 2, blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed at the same time
points as during infusion 1 with the exception that they will not be assessed ever y 4-8hours 
until at least 24 hours after the start of the infusion.
5.2.5.2 Physical examination
A phy sical examination including height, weight and ECOG performance score will be 
performed at screening and at the time points specified in the Flow Chart s.During the 
physical examination, the patient should be assessed for possible AEs.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
During the treatment phase, patients with refractory  or relapsed AML will receive 
administration with BI 836858 every  7 day s.  For AML  patients in CR, The first three 
administrations will be given onc e every  second week on day 1 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 . From 
the 4thadministration onwards, patients will receive monthly  (every  second cy cle) infusions 
of BI 836858 (i.e. 4thinfusion on Cycle 5 Day  1, 5thinfusion on Cycle 7 Day  1…) for overall 
up to 12 mon ths of treatment.
Patients are required to be hospitalized under close surveillance with access to intensive care 
for at least 24 hours after the first administration of BI 836858 to allow close monitoring for 
infusion -related reactions or other AEs.  Aft er good tolerability  of the first administration of 
BI 836858, the Investigator may evaluate the risk for an infusion -related reaction and other 
AEs in view of relevant co morbidities or AML -related sy mptoms, and as a result, the patient 
may receive subseq uent infusions in the out -patient setting.  
In case a patient misses a visit within one treatment cy cle and the patient comes to the clinic 
between the missed and the next scheduled visit, the delay ed visit should be scheduled as 
soon as possible and docu mented with the actual date and the reason for the delay ed visit. 
The next visit, should still take place at the time it was originally  scheduled in this treatment

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This trial will be performed as an open -label stud y.  The primary objective of the trial is to 
determine the MTD of BI 836858 for both patient populations separatel y.  To determine the 
MTD, patients are entered sequentially  into escalating dose tiers usin g the 3+3 design (see 
Section 3.1 ).  After the MTD has been determined, up to 12 patients for each patient 
population are additionally  entered at this dose level to better characterize the safet yof BI 
836858.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERN ATIVE HYPOTHESES
The anal yses in this trial are descriptive and explorat ory. No formal statistical tests will be 
performed.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
For the determination of the MTD, only  MTD evaluable (i.e. non -replaced patients) will be 
considered. 
For the analysis of secondary   all patients in the 
treated set (i.e. patients treated with at least one dose of BI 836858) will be included in the 
analysis, including the pati ents who have been replaced for an y reason (see Section 3.3.4.1 ).
7.3.1 Primary analyses
The primary  objective for this study  is to identify the MTD (for both patient populations 
separately ) and to investigate the safet y profile of BI 836858. MTD is defined in Section 3.1 , 
and will be identified b y the occurrence of DLT in the dose escalation scheme. In order to 
identify  the MTD, the number of patients with a DLT during the first two cy clesat each dose 
level will be presented. Patients who discontinue during the first two treatment cyclesfor 
reasons other than DLT will be excluded from the determination of MTD. 
However, for those patients who receive more than two cy cles of BI 836858, all AEs that 
constitute a DLT will be taken into consideration for the purpose of det ermining the 
recommended dose for the expansion cohort or the recommended dose for subsequent phase
IItrial(s).
DLT is defined in Section 5.2.1.1 . For the anal ysis of the tolerability  and safet y, please refer 
to Section 7.3.3 .
The primary  anal ysis will take place when all patients from the dose escalation and dose 
expansion cohorts have had a minimum of 4 cy cles or have discontinued from the trial prior 
to reaching end of cy cle 4 due to meeting t he criteria for withdrawal as outlined in Section 
3.3.4.1.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.In case patients are still being treated at the time of the primary  anal ysis, a revised clinical 
trial report (CTR) will be created when the last patient has completed his/her last visit ,
including all primary  and secondary  anal yses.
7.3.2 Secondary analyses
This section outlines the anal yses for the secondary   as 
defined in Section 5.1.1 .
 
 
7.3.2.3 Best overall response
Each patient will be assigned to one of the response categories described in Section 5.1.2.3 . 
Each patient’s best overall response will be used as a primary  measure. To describe response 
over time, the proportion of patients in each response category  will be tabulated at specified 
time intervals. The number of patients with objective response (best response of CR ,CRi, or 
PR)will be summarized. Patients will be followed up for assessment of response and 
progression until they  progress, receive any  other anti -leukemia therap y, die, or until the trial 
ends. The observed length of follow -up and the number of patients available for anal ysis at 
each time point will determine the period of time covered in tables and figures.  Frequency  
distribution and other descriptive statistical measures will be used to examine these varia bles.
7.3.2.4 Progression free survival, time to treatment failure
These time -to-event variables will be anal yzed with the Kaplan- Meier method.
In case there is no occurrence of death , progression or treatment failure until the last visit of 
the trial the time will be censored.  The percentage of patients who are event free will be 
display ed at monthly  or greater time intervals as appropriate.  Details of censoring rules will 
be provided in the statistical anal ysis plan.
The cause of death will be summarized, along with whether death was plausible related to 
disease progression.

7.3.3 Safety analyse s
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary tables and listi ngs will be produced. All 
adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period 
(REP), a period of 30 day s after the last dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the 
treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analys is. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end 
of the residual effect period will be considered ‘treatment-emergent’.  The residual effect 
period is defined as a period of 30 day s after the last dose of trial. Adverse events that start 
before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -
emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).
Laboratory  data will be analy sed both quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via compa rison of laboratory  data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively  with regard to distribution 
paramet ers as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the tri al and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.
7.3.4 Interim analyses
The sponsor will continuously  monitor safet y. The dose escalation design foresees that 
regular saf ety evaluations are performed. These evaluations will be un-blinded to dose.
No formal interim anal ysis of efficacy  data is foreseen, although efficacy  data when available 
may be considered as part of the safet y evaluations.

in the statistical analy sis plan.
If considered necessary , a preliminary  safet y evaluation may also be performed in AML  
patients in CR.  This analy sis will have no impact on the further conduct of the trial but can 
become necessary  forinternal project purposes.  Results of this evaluation will be

emphasis on potential DLT.
If not stated otherwise, missing data will not be imputed and remain missing. Potential 
outliers will be reported and anal yzed as observed.
The occurrence of missing data should be minimized by  follow -up of patients for both 
disease progression and mortality  after end of trial for an individua l patient. Both response 
and progression status for patients who are lost to follow- up or who die before progression 
has been documented, will be assessed at the end of the trial. 
Missing baseline laboratory  values will be imputed by  respective values fro m the screening 
visit.

This is a non -randomized Phase I trial. All the patients will receive BI 836858.
7.6 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
Patients with refractory  or relapsed AML:
Assuming 4 cohorts of 3 patients (i.e. no patients with DL Tat given level) and 2 cohorts of 
6 patients (i.e. 1 DLT witnessed in first 3 patients so further 3 patients exposed with no 
DLTs), 24 evaluable patients will be necessary  for the dose escalation part .
Together with an assumed number of 12 additional pati ents for the expansion cohort this 
leads to a nexpected sample size of 36 evaluable patients .
AML  patients in CR:
Assuming 1 cohort of 3 patients (i.e. no patients with DL T at given level) and 2 cohorts of 
6 patients (i.e. 1 DLT witnessed in first 3 patie nts so further 3 patients exposed with no 
DLTs), 15 evaluable patients will be necessary  for the dose escalation part in this patient 
population.
Together with an assumed number of 12 additional patients for the expansion cohort this 
leads to an expected s ample size of 27 evaluable AML  patients in CR.
Note that in general, the sample size is induced by the 3+3 design and is subject to different 
random factors.

trial, oreach Investigator willbevisited individually  by the Clinical Moni torand the CRA. 
Each Investigator will receive an ISF with all information relevant for the performance of the 
trial. Investigator s will be visited at regular intervals for on- site monitoring by  a Boehringer
Ingelheim employ ee or a CRA authorised by  BI. A t these occasions, source data verification
(SDV) will be performed and a check will be done whether the eCRFs are kept current. The
information in the eCRF and information in source documents will be cross -checked as
described in Section 8.3.1 .
The data m anagement procedures to ensure the quality  of the data are described in detail in
the trial data management and anal ysis plan (TDMAP) available in the Clinical Trial Master 
File ( CTMF ). Coding of the data obtained will be done by  using the medical dictiona ry for 
regulatory  activities (MedDRA) and the WHO dictionary  for concomitant medication. Data 
quality  review meetings will be performed at regular intervals to evaluate the quality  ofthe 
data collected. Discrepancies in data will be queried . 
A quality  assurance audit /inspection of this trial may be conducted b y the Sponsor or 
Sponsor ’s designees or by  IRBs/IECs or by  regulatory  authorities . The quality  assurance
auditor will have access to all medical records, the Investigator ’s trial -related files and 
correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.3 RECORDS
Case Report Forms (CRFs) for individual patients will be provided by  the Sponsor via remote 
data capture. For drug accountability , refer to Section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient and substantiate the 
integrit y of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the Investigator ’s site.
Data entered in the eCRFs that are trans cribed from source documents must be consistent
with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The Investigator may need 
to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the trial; also current 
medical records must b e available.
For eCRFs all data must be derived from source documents.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The Investigator / institution will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review

phase of the trial as follows:
“During the dose escalation phase, each patient 
will receive up to 2 repeated treatment cycles. In 
patients who show clinical benefit as defined by 
IWG objective resp onse (CR, CRi, PR), or 
subjective response (in the absence of objective 
response) as defined by the Investigator after 2 
cycles, the number of cycles on the s ame dose level 
may be increased to 4 (8 administrations) upon 
agreement between Investigator and Sponsor. This 
includes Cycle three (administration of BI 836858 
on Days 29 and 36) and cycle four (administration 
of BI 836858 on Days 43 and 50). Continuation of 
treatment will be discussed between Investigators 
and Sponsor at each cycle.”

increased every 3 0 (+/ -10) minutes by 10 mL/h to a 
maximum of 80 mL/h as long as tolerated by the 
patient. If considered safe by the Investigator, the 
stepwise increase of infusion rate during the third 
and subsequent infusions may be faster or steps may 
be omitted, but th e maximum infusion rate must not 
exceed 120 mL/h. If symptoms of an infusion -related 
reaction occur, the infusion should be temporarily 
stopped. Upon recovery, it should be infused at 50% 
of the rate at which the reaction occurred and 
should not be dose es calated from this dose for at 
least 30 minutes. Lower rates may be selected if 
clinically indicated. Depending on the time of

stepwise re -increase of the infusion rate to a 
maximum of 80 mL/h is possible. For medical 
reasons, i n case a patient experiences an adverse 
event during the infusion, the duration of the 
infusion may be expanded until the use- by date and 
use-by time indicated on the label is reached. The 
actual duration of the infusion s and the infusion 
steps need to be documented in the eCRF including 
actual start and end time, actual time points for

Rationale for change Clarification and Update.
The stepwise increase of the infusion rate of BI 
836858 was adapted and an upper limit of 80ml/hr 
is defined in the protocol amendment. However ,
some flexibility  is given in case the first four 
administrations of BI 836858 are well tolerated.

every  7 day s.”
The text referring to dose levels was modified: “The 
dose is planned to be escalated in cohorts at pre -
defined dose levels based on a multiplication factor 
of 2. 3 in the low dose range, and a factor of 
approximately  2 at doses higher than 90 mg.  The

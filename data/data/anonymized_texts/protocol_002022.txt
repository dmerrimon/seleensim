1.0 Research Design
1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg 
and Aspirin 25mg), in brand or generic formulation,  in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. For ease, we will identify the drug as Aggrenox, 
regardless of the formulation.
Among 132 SARS-CoV-2 patients (66 patients in each randomized arm), we will 
determine the efficacy of Aggrenox on clinical outcomes.
A.  Endpoints:
      Primary Endpoint:
Change in composite COVID ordinal scale at day 15. Ordinal scale: 1) not hospitalized with 
resumption of normal activities; 2) not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; 3) hospitalized, not requiring oxygen; 4) hospitalized, requiring oxygen; 5) hospitalized, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy, or noninvasive ventilation; 6) hospitalized, requiring invasive ventilation; 7) ventilation plus additional organ support such as vasopressors, renal replacement therapy and ECMO and 8) death.
Secondary Endpoints:
1) all-cause mortality assessed on day 15 and day 28. 
2) oxygen-free days through day 28. 3) invasive-ventilator-free days through day 28. 4) ICU-free days through day 28.5) hospital-free days through day 28. 6) increase in cycle threshold (Ct) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR test as an approximation of decline 
in viral load at days 7 and 15. 
7) decrease in the markers D-dimer/ ferritin/ c-reactive protein at days 7 and 15.8) thromboembolic complications including stroke at day 28.9) Change in COVID ordinal scale at day 28.10) When feasible urine will be analyzed for markers of tubular injury IL-18, kidney injury 
molecule-1 [KIM-1], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL]), inflammation (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]), and repair (human cartilage glycoprotein-40 [YKL-40]
B.  Hypotheses / Research Question(s)Compared to standard care, addition of Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg), to standard care will result in improvement in composite COVID ordinal scale at day 15. Additionally, combined Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally), and standard care will reduce need for ventilation, length of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay and improve survival more than standard care alone in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
1.2 Research Significance
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and which has recently evolved into a pandemic posing a serious

threat to public health worldwide.1,2. Thus, development of effective preventative and therapeutic 
interventions is paramount.
     Despite its importance, information about pathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 remains 
incomplete. Recent data suggests the role of exaggerated immune/inflammatory response and hypercoagulability as pathogenic mechanisms leading to clinical manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stroke and extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction.
3 Due 
to the significant activation of coagulation system, the coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 may result in thromboembolic complications such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and strokes.
4 
Prophylactic anti-coagulation therapies have become the standard of care in the management of these patients.
4 The International society of thrombosis and hemostasis has recommended 
that all COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital, irrespective of the severity of their illness, should be started on prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
5 The Society 
of thrombosis and haemostasis research also recommended that all hospitalized COVID-19 patients should receive pharmacological venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis unless contraindicated.
6 Recent literature shows that the risk of thromboembolism is higher in patients 
admitted to the ICU. For the patients admitted to the ICU or having additional risk factors for VTE such as BMI> 30mkg/m2, history of VTE or rapidly rising D-dimer levels, high-risk prophylactic LMWH dosages twice daily should be considered.
6 The therapeutic doses of either 
UFH or LMWH should be considered for those who have confirmed thrombosis including filter thrombosis.
7 The anti-inflammatory properties of LMWH have been suggested to provide 
additional benefits in COVID-19 patients.4 
Utilization of a therapeutic that can simultaneously intervene along multiple pathways (viral 
replication, inflammation, vasoconstriction, and coagulation) can dramatically improve patient 
outcomes.    
Adenosine  is a highly potent immunoregulatory nucleoside that interferes with inflammatory 
processes by modulating the biosynthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines, slowing down the oxidative activity, preventing platelet aggregation, and reducing neutrophils adhesion and degranulation.
8,9 One mechanism to increase extracellular adenosine is to inhibit 
intracellular uptake of adenosine and thereby capitalize on its anti-inflammatory properties. It has a wide-ranging effects on multiple organ systems by interacting with different adenosine receptors.
9 Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) are nucleoside transporters that 
regulate the flux of endogenous nucleosides, nucleobases and therapeutic analogs.10 Given the 
critical nature of regulating nucleosides in a number of pathological processes, ENTs have emerged as a druggable target. ENT inhibitors are used to modulate nucleosides in a number of disease states including viral infections such as HIV
11, and tumors12.
     Dipyridamole (DIP)  is one such ENT inhibitor (specific for the major and ubiquitous 
nucleoside transporter ENT-1), that inhibits nucleoside (adenosine) uptake into the endothelial and other cells and has been shown to enhance the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory 
effect of adenosine .13 A recent study has shown that DIP increases extracellular adenosine 
levels and thereby provides a significant decrease in CD8+T-cell activation and decreased 
macrophage activation among persons with HIV-1 infection on antiviral  therapy.11 
DIP may have additional therapeutic advantages to SARS-CoV-2 patients. DIP is a widely known phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor with antiplatelet
14 and vasodilatoratory15 effects . Of 
particular note, a recent screen of FDA approved drugs identified the ability of DIP to effectively

suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication  with a therapeutically achievable EC50 concentration of 100 
nM.16 Moreover, a small study of 22 COVID-19 patients suggested improved outcomes 
including reduction in coagulation markers.17 These antiviral data are not without precedent as 
DIP has also been shown to have powerful antiviral activity against single-stranded RNA viruses  
in vitro, and in a VSV-induced viral pneumonia model in vivo.18-20 Additional possible benefits 
could include the anti-inflammatory action and promotion of mucosal healing.21 It may also 
prevent acute injury and progressive fibrosis of the lung, heart, liver, and kidney.22 In one small 
clinical series of 12 patients (pre-print, not peer-reviewed data), the authors used DIP as a 
prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy and reported significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP therapy 60% of their severe patients and all patients with mild disease were discharged from the hospital.
17 
     Aspirin is a well-known anti-platelet drug with anti-inflammatory properties. Aspirin inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase-1 activity that is essential for generation of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 is a potent vasoconstrictor that also induces platelet aggregation and release of proinflammatory proteins from platelet storage granules. The literature evidence suggests that aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole may be more suitable for preventing secondary stroke because, in addition to their antiplatelet actions, these drugs possess complementary anti-inflammatory properties.
23
     Thus, we hypothesize that Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg 
orally/enterally), adjunctive therapy can be useful for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients through 
enhancing immune recovery, antiviral properties, and correcting the coagulation profile. 
     We propose a randomized, 2-arm, open-label single-site pilot study to evaluate the effect of oral/enteral Aggrenox on clinical outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV. We will randomly assign 132 consenting participants to two treatment groups: 1) Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ 
Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally), + standard care and 2) standard care alone. We will collect 
demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data. The patients would be followed daily for 
2 weeks after enrollment while the patient is in the hospital and once discharged, they will be 
called every 3rd day to follow up on the symptoms. 
1.2 Research Design and Methods
1: 1 Randomized design.Arm 1:  Aggrenox plus standard care. Participants will receive Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 
200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally), 2 times daily (FDA–recommended dose) starting on the 
day of enrollment for a total of 2 weeks along with standard care.Arm 2:  Standard care. Participants will receive standard care starting on the day of enrollment 
for a total of 2 weeks. 
We will perform a randomized, 2-arm, open-label single-site pilot study to evaluate the effect of oral Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally), on clinical outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. In this research proposal, we will randomly assign 132 consenting participants with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to two treatment groups: 1) Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally) + standard care and 2) standard care alone. Participants will be screened, enrolled, receive treatment and followed for 28 days. The study

aim and procedure will be explained to every eligible subject and informed consent will be 
obtained from interested subjects or authorized proxy to participate in the study. We do not anticipate problems with enrollment as sufficient number of COVID-19 patients are admitted at Rutgers-NJMS (approximately 2-5 new COVID-19 admissions daily, and total 18-20 patients who are currently admitted at Rutgers-NJMS with 5-6 patients in intensive care units).
Randomization.  The P.I. or study coordinator will review the screening and enroll participants 
in the randomization. Once a participant has been randomized, we will conduct all evaluations 
irrespective of whether the participant starts the treatment, and how long the participants 
continues on the treatment or not. SARS-CoV-2 patients will be allocated in a 1:1 randomized fashion using computer generated random sequence to one of two groups: the Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally), plus standard care or the standard 
care. Data collection will end after 28 days, or the patient dies or withdraws consent.

3. Study Safety Assessments 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are 
familiar with the content of this section. 
Definitions: 
• Adverse Events: 
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of 
a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. The term AE is used to include both serious and non- serious AEs. 
• Serious Adverse Events: 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., screening, run- in, treatment, wash-out, follow-up), at any dose of the study drugs that fulfills one or more of the following criteria and deemed secondary to the use of study drug: 
Results in death
Is immediately life-threatening
Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical   intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
1.1.1 The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by the investigator(s) and communicated to Boehringer Ingelheim ( BI) via BI 
SAE form and the FDA via MedWatch form, if applicable. 
      Causality will be reported as either “Yes” or “No”.
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.

Non-serious adverse events and SAEs will be determined from the time the patient is enrolled 
into the study and up to and including the 2 weeks follow-up period (after the completion of 2 weeks of treatment with Aggrenox) for a total of 28 days . All grade 3 or higher AEs will be recorded. Grade 1-2 AEs do not need to be recorded. After withdrawal from treatment, subjects must be followed-up for all existing and new AEs for 14 calendar days after the last dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution. All new AEs occurring during that period must be recorded (if SAEs, they must be reported to the DSMB and Rutgers IRB as per SOPs.). AEs will be recorded per Rutgers IRB SOPs. The common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) will be used as a reference to grade the adverse events. 
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_8.5x11.pdf (Accessed on March 09, 2018)
All study-related adverse events/ SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless in the Treating 
Investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease. 
3. Reporting of Serious Adverse EventsInvestigators and other site personnel must inform the Rutgers IRB per the SOPs on the 
required forms. FDA will be informed per SOP, via a MedWatch, of any serious or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting obligations of 21 CFR 312.32. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to compile all necessary information and ensure that the FDA receives a report according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines. 
In addition to FDA, the Sponsor shall report all SAEs and non-serious AEs that occur 
,throughout the treatment period and up to and including the 2 weeks follow-up period (after the completion of 2 weeks of treatment with Aggrenox) for a total of 28 days which are relevant for a reported SAEs and any AEs relevant to a reported SAE  by fax or other secure method using BI IIS SAE form to the BI Unique Entry Point in accordance with timeline specified in the safety data exchange agreement . 
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, causality, 
intensity,treatment required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. 
The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once the clinical 
trial has ended. However, if the investigator becomes aware of an SAE(s) that occurred after the patient has completed the clinical trial (including any protocol specified follow-up period), it should be reported to BI if investigator considers it as relevant to the BI study drug.
All SAEs meeting the criteria for expedited reporting will be reported to the Rutgers IRB within 
the mandated time frames. All SAEs within the safety follow-up window (e.g., within 14 days after the last dose of study medications) established in the protocol will be reported. 
Non-serious adverse events and SAEs will be collected from the time the patient is enrolled into 
the study, throughout the treatment period and up to and including the 2 weeks follow-up period (after the completion of 2 weeks of treatment with Aggrenox) for a total of 28 days. After withdrawal from treatment, subjects must be followed-up for all existing and new AEs for 14 calendar days after the last dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution. All new AEs

occurring during that period must be recorded (if SAEs, then they must be reported to the FDA 
as per their reporting criteria). All study-related toxicities/ SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless in the Treating Investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease. 
Clinical Safety Assessments 
•  Recording of Adverse Events 
Non-serious adverse events and SAEs will be determined from the time the study drug is given, 
throughout the treatment period and up to and including the 2 weeks follow up period. All grade 3 or higher AEs will be recorded. Grade 1-2 AEs do not need to be recorded. After withdrawal from treatment, subjects must be followed-up for all existing and new AEs for 14 calendar days after the last dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution. All new AEs occurring during that period must be recorded (if SAEs, they must be reported to the DSMB and Rutgers IRB as per SOPs.). AEs will be recorded per Rutgers IRB SOPs. 
•  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list 
of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 
•  Vital Signs
Temperature will be obtained at least two times a day (AM and PM). Nursing staff will record the 
temperature while the patient is in the hospital. Body temperature will be measured in degrees Fahrenheit using an automated thermometer. An automated thermometer will be provided to the patient once discharged from the hospital for checking the temperature at least once a day for the study duration (28 days total from the enrollment day). 
Study Efficacy/Response Assessments 
Change in composite COVID ordinal scale at day 15. Ordinal scale: 1) not hospitalized with 
resumption of normal activities; 2) not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; 3) hospitalized, not requiring oxygen; 4) hospitalized, requiring oxygen; 5) hospitalized, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy, or noninvasive ventilation; 6) hospitalized, requiring invasive ventilation; 7) ventilation plus additional organ support such as pressors, renal replacement therapy and ECMO and 8) death.
Other response criteria used as secondary endpoints include the need of invasive ventilation, 
the days dependent on ventilator, hospital free days, thromboembolic complications, COVID ordinal scale at day 28 and mortality.

Aspirin is an odorless white needle-like crystalline or powdery substance. When exposed to 
moisture, aspirin hydrolyzes into salicylic and acetic acids, and gives off a vinegary odor. It is highly lipid soluble and slightly soluble in water. 
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action 
The antithrombotic action of AGGRENOX is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of 
dipyridamole and aspirin. 
Dipyridamole 
Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5–1.9 μg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which 
acts on the platelet A 2-receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing 
platelet cyclic-3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). 
Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE 
is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP- PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). 
Aspirin 
Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2, a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and 
vasoconstriction. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetics 
There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as AGGRENOX. 
Absorption 
Dipyridamole:

Page 14 of 37Department of Neurological Surgery
Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey90 Bergen Street, Suite 8100Newark, NJ 07103
Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1–6 hours) after administration 
of a daily dose of 400 mg AGGRENOX (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady- state is 1.98 μg/mL (1.01–3.99 μ g/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 
0.53 μg/mL (0.18– 1.01 μg/mL). 
Aspirin: 
Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5–1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from AGGRENOX (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady- state is 319 ng/mL (175–463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50%–75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. 
Effect of Food 
Dipyridamole: 
When AGGRENOX capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (Cmax) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20-30% compared to 
fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. 
Aspirin: 
When AGGRENOX capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not 
considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. 
Distribution 
Dipyridamole: 
Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. 
Aspirin: 
Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL. 
Metabolism and Elimination 
Dipyridamole: 
Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma,

about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. 
Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half- life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase λz with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption
phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with AGGRENOX which was 13.6 hours. 
Aspirin: 
Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2–2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5–2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10–20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. 
The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with AGGRENOX and has a half- life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2–3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. 
Specific Populations 
Geriatric Patients: 
Dipyridamole: 
In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies (14)], plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with AGGRENOX. 
Hepatic Dysfunction: 
No study has been conducted with AGGRENOX in patients with hepatic dysfunction. 
Dipyridamole: 
In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure.

Aspirin: 
Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. 
Renal Dysfunction: 
Dipyridamole: 
In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies (14)], with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 
mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. 
Aspirin: 
Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies 
A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with AGGRENOX twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar 
with or without omeprazole co- administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state. 
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed to mice (up to 111 weeks in males and females) and rats (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a 2 mg/m basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose(MRHD )in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. 
Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin (1:5 ratio) tested negative in the Ames test, in vivo chromosome aberration tests (in mice and hamsters), oral micronucleus tests (in mice and hamsters) and oral dominant lethal test (in mice). Aspirin, alone, induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. 
Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin have not been evaluated for effects on fertility and 
reproductive performance. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was 
administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). Aspirin inhibits ovulation in rats.

 4.4 Consent Procedures
A. Consent Process
Provision of written or verbal Informed Consent will be obtained prior to any study-related 
procedures. The Investigator will ensure that the study participant is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study. Study participants will also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The study participant will be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. The original Informed Consent Form will be given to the study participant. 
Current FDA, OHRP, NIH, state and institutional regulations concerning informed consent will 
be followed. An IRB approved written informed consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent is required 45CFR46.116. 
1. The investigator shall explain participation is voluntary and all aspects of the study, purpose 
of the study, treatment plan, procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives, and the right to refuse 
and withdraw at any time without penalty in lay language. 
2. The investigator will answer all the patient’s questions regarding the study. 3. The investigator shall give the patient adequate opportunity to read the consent form and to 
discuss with family and friends. 
4. If the patient/ authorized proxy decides to participate in the study, he/she will be asked to 
sign the Informed Consent Document. A copy of the signed Informed Consent Document will be given to the subject and this will be documented in the patient’s medical record. 
5. The investigator shall inform all patients they have the right to refuse study participation and 
withdraw their participation at any time without penalty and will be treated without prejudice. 
•Location of Consent ProcessThe consent form will be reviewed by the investigator, or a delegated study member, in the hospital room. Study participants must sign the consent in person at the participating institution. If the patient wishes to enroll on the study, he or she will sign the informed consent in the presence of a physician or nurse on the study team.
•Ongoing ConsentIf there are any changes to the protocol, these changes will have to be first reviewed and approved by the Rutgers IRB via an amendment before any change is implemented. Once approved, study participants will be notified of the protocol changes and will be provided with the updated informed consent form (ICF) for their signature, if necessary. Study participants will also be provided with a copy of the updated ICF for their records whenever re-consent is required. 
•Individual Roles for Researchers Involved in ConsentOnly a treating investigator or research nurse listed within the IRB application will consent study participants to this study. 
•Consent Discussion DurationIt is anticipated that the informed consent process will take 30-60 minutes.

4.7Risks of Harm/Potential for Benefits to Subjects
A. Description of Risks of Harm to Subjects
Reasonably Foreseeable Risks of Harm (this data I got from Aggrenox product 
information available online- Appendix is attached for your review)) 
Risk of BleedingAGGRENOX increases the risk of bleeding. 
Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). 
Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event 
rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the AGGRENOX group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects 
GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the AGGRENOX group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. 
Peptic Ulcer Disease 
Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. 
Alcohol Warning 
Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 
Renal Failure 
Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations. 
Hepatic Insufficiency 
Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration.
Coronary Artery Disease

Page 25 of 37Department of Neurological Surgery

Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients 
with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 
Hypotension 
Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension.
Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents 
Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with AGGRENOX capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt AGGRENOX capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing. 
Intake of AGGRENOX capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous 
dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 
Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From LiteratureAdenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson)
Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A2A-receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors 
Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. 
Acetazolamide 
Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. 
Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets 
Patients taking AGGRENOX in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. 
Anagrelide 
Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. 
Anticonvulsants 
Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels.

Beta Blockers 
The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. 
Cholinesterase Inhibitors 
Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. 
Diuretics 
The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. 
Methotrexate 
Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. 
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) 
The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. 
Oral Hypoglycemics 
Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. 
Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) 
Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents.

Procedures which Risk Harm to Embryo, Fetus, and/or Pregnant Subjects
Pregnancy Risk Summary 
Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with AGGRENOX use 
during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between AGGRENOX use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). AGGRENOX contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin/dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). 
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4 and 15-20%, respectively. 
Clinical Considerations 
Labor and Delivery 
AGGRENOX, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding.

Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged 
gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. 
Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and 
coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 
Lactation Risk Summary 
Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data). Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of AGGRENOX or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for AGGRENOX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from AGGRENOX or from the underlying maternal condition. 
Data 
A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted.

Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. 
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.  
Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction AGGRENOX has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using 
aspirin containing products, such as AGGRENOX, in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate). 
C. Risks of Harm to Non-Subjects The patient will be given a mask immediately upon arrival and escorted to a private room with a 
closed door. When evaluating the patient during the visit, research personnel will wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as recommended by the CDC. This includes the following: 
•  Gown 
•  Gloves •  Eye/face protection (I.e., goggles, face shield) •  If available, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified 
disposable N95 or better respirator. The CDC has stated that surgical (face) masks have been 
determined to be an acceptable alternative to N95 or better respirators, when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand so long as procedures that are likely to generate respiratory aerosols are not being performed. **The use of a nasopharyngeal swab to collect viral load specimens during this study is not considered an aerosolizing procedure.

health information to be used and/or disclosed for research purposes. Provisions for protecting the privacy interests of include: 
•Ensuring that the conditions under which a procedure is performed or information is collected (e.g., physical locations, telephone contact, mail or email solicitations) afford protections against interactions with participants being witnessed, overheard or inadvertently intercepted or viewed. 
•Limiting the information being collected to only the minimum amount of data necessary to accomplish the research purposes. 
The research team will make all efforts to ensure confidentiality is maintained by: 
•Protecting PHI against public viewing; 
•Proper storage and disposal of documents that contain PHI; 
•Safeguarding computer workstations and databases that access PHI. 
F. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
There may be direct benefit to the patient for participation in this study because the study participant will receive Aggrenox, which is FDA approved and Dipyridamole has been shown to have some benefit in a small series of COVID-19 patients in an unpublished study from China. Although this does not guarantee that each individual patient will benefit. 
Data gathered from this study may allow us to identify an effective treatment for COVID-19 that 
could result in benefit to the patient or society as whole in the future.

6.0 Data Management Plan
6.1 Data Analysis
The sample size of 132 patients (66 patients in each arm) was estimated to provide 90% power 
to detect a relative between-group difference of 20% reduction in composite ordinal scale (from 
day 0 to day 15) with assumption of mean composite ordinal scale value of 4.5 ± 1.6 (yes) at 
baseline (day 0) and two-sided P value of 0.05.20 For primary efficacy, we will do an intention-to-
treat analysis and include all patients who have undergone randomization and will adjust for the 
minimization variables. We will analyze continuous measures by means of linear regression and 
present as mean differences. For binary outcomes, we will present data as risk ratios from a 
binomial regression model.
6.2 Data Security
1. The Human Research Oversight Committee (HROC) is responsible for oversight of protocol 
progress, conduct, and compliance. The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey’s Data 
Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) activities fall under the purview of HROC. In order to ensure the execution of the protocol with a minimum number of obstacles, the HROC focuses on the following objectives: 
•  Monitor data and safety of CINJ investigator-initiated trials, including serious adverse   
events (SAE), enrollment progress, stopping rules, etc. 
•  Review the safety of all trials conducted at CINJ.

•  Review enrollment to cooperative group and industry-sponsored studies. 
•  Review study compliance through deviation reports of all trials, Quality Assurance (QA) 
audit reports of CINJ investigator-initiated trials and external monitoring reports of all 
trials. 
•  Conduct response review for investigator-initiated trials. 
6.3 Data and Safety Monitoring
A. Data/Safety Monitoring Plan
The Principal Investigators will be responsible for monitoring the data, assuring protocol compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which must be conducted at a minimum of once a month (including when re-approval of the protocol is sought). The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey’s Human Research Oversight Committee (HROC) will be the DSMB of record. During the review process, the principal investigators (serving as monitor) will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either principal investigator, IRB or either Data or Safety Monitoring Committee have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications at each institution. The PIs will be responsible for sharing this information in a timely fashion and coordinating appropriate parallel actions at the other institution. 
An audit will be conducted following enrollment of the first two (2) or three (3) patients. 
Subsequent audits will occur dependent on the rate of enrollment. More frequent audits of patient data and study conduct will occur if necessary. Prior audit findings and/or situations that may arise during the study will determine the need for more frequent auditing. All audit findings will be discussed with the principal investigator and the Rutgers University IRB.

 2. Introduction  
 
 
Widespread testing is the cornerstone of COVID -19 control around the world. However, U.S. 
testing to identify people with infected SARS -CoV -2 has been slow to start and continues to lag. 
An important feature of SARS -CoV -2 is that it can be transmitted while a host is unaware of 
infection (asymptomatic). Epidemiologic evidence has demonstrated that pre -symptomatic and 
asymptomatic transmission of virus has driven the current epidemic1. Antigen tests have a great 
potential for screening asymptomatic people2. To limit outbreaks, testing is needed to identify as 
many individuals who are transmitting infection as quickly as possible. Antigen Tests have the 
potential to readily identify an individual who is at or near p eak infection. Rapid Tests, while less 
sensitive, perform best during the early stages of COVID -19 infection; when viral load and 
potential for spread is high.  
 
There is an unmet need to provide broad testing that can serve high risk and low resource 
communities. The FDA’s authorization for antigen tests for home use is helping to expand 
Americans’ access to testing, reducing the burden on laboratories and test su pplies3. The Biozek 
Antigen Rapid Test can be easily performed by untrained personnel with results in less than 15 
minutes. The increased potential for repeated testing, remote or at home testing, could help 
contain the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
3. Background  
_____________________________________________________________________________  
 
In December 2019, an outbreak emerged identifying a novel coronavirus, severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2). The World Health Organization (WHO) 
declared it a global pandemic in March 2020.   Testing in the U.S. appeared to be insufficient for 
optimal early containment of the virus. With the resurgence of the disease  (COVID -19), the U.S. 
has recently seen the highest number of hospitalizations since the beginning of the pandemic and 
rates are expected to increase in future weeks4. Given the continued community transmission of 
SARS -CoV -2 in the US, there has been sustained focus on the role of testing to reduce the 
spread. Presently, the gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is used to diagnose 
COVID -19 by detecting th e presence of specific genetic material of the virus. PCR test requires 
laboratory processi ng and it may take days to obtain results. In turn, an individual could be 
negative at time of testing but positive by the time the result is returned5. PCR testing is 
performed by a trained healthcare professional at an approved testing facility. In contrast, The 
BIOZEK Rapid Antigen Test detects specific proteins on the surface of the virus and it can be 
self-administered. Results are generated in 15 m inutes and can be performed at home or any 
remote location. In efforts to meet the exponential demand in testing, the introduction of a new 
and effective Rapid Test could potentially end the spread of COVID -19.

 4. Study Objectives:   
_____________________________________________________________________________  
 
To assess sensitivity and specificity of BIOZEK COVID -19 Antigen Rapid Test on a self -
collected sample and self -perform ed test by subject (nasopharyngeal swab and oral fluid) . 
                                                 
To assess subject’s performance to collect samples and conduct BIOZEK COVID -19 Antigen 
Rapid Test . 
5. Investigational Product  
_____________________________________________________________________________  
 
The BIOZEK COVID -19 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette is a qualitative membrane -based 
immunoassay for the detection of SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid protein antigens  in human 
nasopharyngeal swab specimens  and in oral fluid specimens . SARS -CoV -2 antibody is coated in 
the test line region. During testing, the specimen reacts with SARS -CoV -2 antibody -coated 
particles in the test. The mixture then migrates upward on the membrane by capillary action and 
reacts with the SARS -CoV -2 antibody  in the test line region.  
If the specimen contains SARS -CoV -2 Antigens, a colored line will appear in the test line region 
as a result of this. If the specimen does not contain antigens to SARS -CoV -2, no colored line will 
appear in the test line region, indicating a negative result . To serve as a procedural control, a 
colored line will always appear in the control line region, indicating that the proper volume of 
specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.  
 
If the specimen contains SARS -CoV -2 Antigens, a colored line will appear in the test  line region 
as a result of this. If the specimen does not contain antigens to SARS -CoV -2, no colored line will 
appear in the test line region, indicating a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, a 
colored line will always appear in the control  line region, indicating that the proper volume of 
specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.  
 
 
Table.1 Amounts, concentrations, or quantities of antibodies in each test.  
 
As shown in illustration above, the specimen (A) migrates via capillary action along the 
membrane to react with the colored conjugate (B). COVID -19 antigen present in the specimen 
binds to the conjugate, forming a colored antibody -antigen complex. The Anti -SARS -CoV2 
immobilized in the test zone of the membrane captures the test region (C). The formation of a 

8 
BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June 1 , 2021  
 visible colored line in the test region indicates a positive result (C). The absence of a colored line 
in the test zones suggests a negative result. In the control zone of the membrane, immobilized 
reagents capture colored conjugate regardless of test spec imen composition. The resulting visible 
colored band (D) confirms the control  line.

Description of Test Steps:  
 
Biozek Covid -19 Antigen Rapid Test  
Specimen Collection  - Nasopharyngeal Swab 
 
1. Insert a provided sterile swab into the nostril of the patient carefully, reaching the surface of 
the posterior nasopharynx.  
2. Swab over the surface of the posterior nasopharynx gently. 3. Withdraw the sterile swab from 
the nasal cavity.  
 
 
Nasal Swab Specimen Collection  
1. Insert a sterile swab less than one inch (about 2 cm) into a nostril (until resistance is met at the 
turbinate).  
2. Rotate the swab 5 -10 times against the nasal wall. Using the same swab  repeat the collection 
procedure with the second nostril.  
3. Withdraw the sterile swab, avoid excess volume and high -viscous nasal discharge.  

10 
BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June 1 , 2021  
  
Caution: If the swab stick breaks during specimen collection, repeat specimen collection with a 
new swab.  
 
Specimen Extraction –Nasopharyngeal  Swab  
Only the extraction buffer provided in this kit is to be used for specimen extraction.  
1. Peel off the sealing on the extraction tube with extraction buffer inside.  
2. Place the swab specimen into the extraction buffer, for better mixture and extraction to release 
the antigen, rotate the swab for approximately 10 seconds while pressing the swab head against 
the inner wall of the tube at least 5 times to release the antigen.  
3. Remove the swab while squeezing the swab head against the inner wall of the tube to get 
maximum solution left inside the extraction tube. Dispose of the used swab in your biohazard 
waste.  
4. Fit the tip onto the top of the extraction tube. Use extracted sample solution as final sample for 
testing as soon as poss ible. 
 
 
NOTE: The storage of the extracted specimen is stable for 2 hours at room temperature or 24 
hours at 2 -8°C. 
 
Testing Procedure – Nasopharyngeal Swab  
Allow the test cassette, extracted sample solution and/or controls to equilibrate to room 
temperature (15 -30°C) prior to testing.  
1. Remove the test cassette from the sealed foil pouch and use it within one hour. Best results 
will be obtained if the test is performed immediately after opening the foil pouch.  
2. Shake the extracted sample solution to mix it w ell. Invert the sample extraction tube and add 3 
drops of the Extracted Sample Solution (approx.75 -100μL) to the specimen well(S) of the 

11 
BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June 1 , 2021  
 cassette. Start the timer.  
3. Wait for the red line(s) to appear and read the result at 15 minutes. Do not interpret the result 
after 20 minutes.  
 
 
Interpretation of results - Nasopharyngeal Swab  
POSITIVE:  * Two red lines appear. One red line should be in the control region (C) and another 
red line should be in the test region (T). Positive result in the test region indicates detection of 
COVID -19 antigens in the sample. *NOTE: Red color line intensity in t he test region (T) will 
vary based on the amount of COVID -19 antigen 
present in the sample. Any shade of red color in the 
test region (T) should be considered positive.  
 
NEGATIVE:  One red line appe ars in the control 
region (C). No apparent red line appears in the test 
region (T) indicates a negative COVID -19 antigen 
test result.  
 
INVALID:  No red line appears in the control region 
(C). Insufficient specimen volume or incorrect 
procedural techniques are the most likely reasons for control line failure. Review the procedures 
and repeat the test with a new cassette. If the problem persists, discontinue using the test kit 
immediately and contact your local BIOZEK products distributo r.

other substances at least 10 minutes prior to specimen collection.  
Step 1  
Connect the plastic tube (number 2) to the mouthpiece (number 1). Press the 
plastic tube as far as possible into the mouthpiece.  
 
Step 2  
If you are having trouble collecting saliva in your mouth, try closing your mouth and wiggling 
your tongue. Gently rubbing the outside of your cheeks, just behind your back teeth. Making 
chewing motions with your mouth.  
 
NOTE: We recommend carrying out this step in the morning.  
 
Step 3  
Spit the oral fluid into the mouthpiece. There should be about 0.5 ml of liquid in 
the plastic tube. This corresponds to the bottom line on the plastic tube.  
 
Step 4a  
Remove the mouthpiece (number 1) and dispose of it in the specimen bag 
(number 8). Place the plastic tube in the holder (number 6).  
 
Step 4b (only follow this step if there is too much saliva)  
More than 0.5 ml of liquid? Take the pipette (number 3). Press and hold the bulb 
until the pipette protrudes into the solution of the plastic tube (1). Release the 
balloon slowly, so that the pip ette sucks up the solution (2). Bring the liquid level to 
the bottom line (0.5 ml).  
 
 
Specimen Extraction – Oral Fluid  
Step 5  
Take the buffer (number 4) and remove the seal at the top (by cutting/breaking it). 
Squeeze the contents of the buffer into the plastic tube (number 2) containing the 
mucus/spittle.  
 
Step 6  
Put the cap (number 5) on the plastic tube (number 2).  
 

13 
BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June 1 , 2021  
  
 
Step 7

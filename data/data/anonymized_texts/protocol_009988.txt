Rationale for this Study  
Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) arise from post thymic lymphocytes, representing non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the 
western populations. Based on  immunophenotyping, molecular, clinical and pathologic  features, there are about 22 different 
subtypes of P TCL that are broadly classified into nodal, extranodal, leukemic variant and cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) 
based on th e site of origin of the disease. Approximately 5,000 new cases of PTCL are diagnosed annually in the US. Most PTCL 
cases have a dismal prognosis with a 5 year survival of less than 30% with the exception of ALK+ ALCL . 
The Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway . Bcl-2 over-expression is a major contributor 
to the pathogenesis of some types of lymphoid malignancies and has been extensively studied in B cell lymphomas, including CLL 
and DLBCL. In studies of T -cell lymphoma at City of Hope , Bcl -2 has been found to be expressed in 52 -76% of cases of PTCL and 
25% of CTCL . So far there is no publ ished data regarding the use of Bcl -2 inhibitors in the treatment of peripheral T cell lymphomas 
and cutaneous T cell lymphomas . 
Venetoclax (also known as ABT -199) is a novel, orally available, small molecule Bcl -2 family protein inhibitor that binds with high 
affinity to Bcl -2 and with lower affinity to other Bcl -2 family proteins such as Bcl -xL and Bcl-w. There is currently clinical experience 
with venetoclax in CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia and B -cell NHL. In the Phase 1 study of venetoclax in diffuse l arge B-cell 
lymphoma and follicular lymphoma the overall response rate was 15%  and 34%  with a median duration of response of 3.3 months  
and 10 months, respectively.  In diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, there is an ongoing trial evaluating the combination of venetoclax 
with rituximab or obinutuzumab plus CHOP ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  We hypothesize that interference of BCL2 will lead to antitumor 
activity in mature T-cell lymphomas.  
Experience with the first 6 patients on the venetoclax monotherapy was that only 2 patients  were able to complete the 
unacceptable toxicity evaluation  period (2 cycles) . PTCL are aggressive lymphomas , and during the first version of the protocol 
with a weekly ramp up it became eviden t that most patients progressed before the completion of C1.  Three patients were 
enrolled on the weekly ramp up , two of them had clinical PD/PD after 1 cycle of therapy and terminated treatment without 
unacceptable toxicities; they had to be replaced.  The 3rd patient completed 2 cycles with  no unacceptable toxicities. The 
protoocl was then modified to accelerate the ramp up to 1 week. This is similar to studies  of Venetoclax  that have been cond ucted 
in aggressive heamtological malignancies including AML [1] where a more rapid ramp up was studied and felt to be sa fe. Once the 
protocol was modified, 3  additional patients have been accured. Two patients are off -treatment before completing the 1st 
cycle without unacceptble toxicities and had to be replaced,  due to disease progression (n=1) or due to neutropenia (n=1, 
several grade 2 and 3 neutropenia events but grade 3 only lasted for a day). The 3rd patient completed 2 cycles without 
unacceptable toxicities . Since it remains a promising strategy to be studied in PTCL, we propose to  evaluate venetoclax in

Page 5 of 94 combination w ith another active agent, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) romidepsin. Romidepsin has regulatory 
approval for use as a single agent in relapsed CTCL and PTCL, and has been shown in vitro and in primary patient samples to a ct 
synergistically with v enetoclax via effects on Bcl -2 family proteins to increase antineoplastic efficacy. Therefore it is hoped that 
addition of romidepsin will slow disease progression, allow patients to complete the unacceptable toxicity  period in the Safety 
Lead-in portion o f the trial and then enable accrual and evaluation on the phase 2 portion.  
Objectives  
Primary Objectives  
Safety Lead-in: 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of venetoclax  with romidepsin , including the dose ramp-up, in 
adults with relapsed or refractory mature T -cell lymphoma.  
Phase 2: 
 To estimate the efficacy as measured by the overall response rate [ ORR]) of venetoclax  with romidepsin  in patients with 
relapsed or refractory mature T -cell lymphoma.  
Phase 2 Secondar y Objectives 
 To evaluate the complete response rate, duration of response, time to response, overall survival and progression free 
survival associated with venetoclax  and romidepsin in relapsed/refractory mature T -cell lymphoma.  
 To further characterize the  safety and toxicities of venetoclax and romidepsin combination in relapsed/refracto ry 
mature T-cell lymphoma.  
Exploratory Objective 
 BCL2 protein expression in baseline trea tment tumor samples and correlation with response  
 To determine changes in Bcl -2 gene expression in pre - and post-treatment tumor samples of mature T - cell lymphoma  
 
Study Design  
This is an open -label multi -site Phase 2 study with a Safety Lead -in to test the safety and efficacy of  venetoclax  with romidepsin  
for the treatment mature T -cell lymphoma .  
During the safety -lead in, 6 evaluable participants will  be enrolled using a 3+3 design . A Simon 2 -stage optimal design will be 
utilized for the Phase 2 portion of the trial . Participants enrolled during the Safety Lead- in will be included in the Phase 2 portion 
of the study if they are evaluable for response. In the absence of study holds to accrual for toxicity or for futility, accrual will 
continue until 18 evaluable participants are tr eated. 
PTCL patients will be treated with up to 2 6 cycles with venetoclax  and romidepsin. Treatment cycles will be 28 -days.  
Participants will continue with treatment until disease progression, unaccept able toxicity or completion of 26 cycles of protocol 
therapy, whichever comes first.  
Evaluation Criteria and Endpoints  
Safety 
Toxicity will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE v 5 .0. During the first 2 cycles, all grades of toxicity will be collected. After cycle 2, 
only the highest grade of any toxicity will be collected for each cycle during protocol treatment and for the period of safety foll ow-
up after end of treatment . 
Unacceptable toxicity for Safety Lead- in  
Unacceptable toxicity will be defined as one of the following AEs that is at least possibly related to either study drug  within the 
first 2 cycles of protocol therapy :

Statistical Considerations  
Safety Lead-in 
Up to 6 patients may be enrolled under a “3+3” design at  the proposed dose (maximum dose of 800 mg/day with a 1 -week dose 
ramp up schedule). Unacceptable toxicities will be evaluated during the first 2 cycles of therapy. This will ensure monitorin g of 
participants during the ramp -up period (Cycle 1 , Days 1-8) and while participants are on steady- state dose ( Cycle 1 Days 8- 28, 
Cycle 2). Initially up to 3 patients can be enrolled and treated. After 3 patients are treated and evaluated for unacceptable  
toxicities, if 0/1 out of 3 patients experience unacceptable toxicities during the first 2 cycles, up to 3 additional patients will  be 
enrolled and treated to bring the total number of patients treated to 6. If ≤1/6 patients experience unacceptable toxicities during 
the first 2 cycles, the proposed treatment dose/schedule will be considered tolerable and be used for the subsequent Phase 2 
response evaluation. If ≥2/3 (after the initial 3) or ≥2/6 (after the total 6 in 2 cohorts) patients experience unacceptable toxicities 
during the first 2 cycles, the accrual will be suspended and the study will be amended.   
Phase 2 
The primary endpoint for Phase 2 is ORR after 2 cycles  of treatment . The response evaluation will be based on a Si mon’s Two -
Stage Optimal design t o distinguish a promising 30% response rate (alternative hypothesis) from a disappointing rate (null 
hypothesis) of 10%, at a one -sided type I error of 10% and a power of 80%. In the first stage, 7 evaluable subjects will be accrued. 
If there is 0 response among the 7, the study accrual will be suspended. If there are 1 or more responses among the 7, the study 
will remain open to accrue a total of 18 evaluable patients. Observing 4 or more responses among 18 evaluable patients will

Page 7 of 94 reject the null hypothesis a nd indicate the response rate being p romising in this study setting.  Observing 3 or fewer responses 
among 18 evaluable patients will fail to reject the null hypothesis and will not establish efficacy of the treatment.  
Stopping rules for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)  
The study will implement accrual stopping rules for both clinical TLS and laboratory TLS. When a stopping rule is triggered, t he 
study PMT will review and assess the safety of the trial and s ubmit a report to the COH DSMC.  The COH DSMC will review for 
approval any decision to continue or permanently suspend accrual to the trial.  
 Clinical TLS Stopping Rule  
−  Study accrual will be suspended when the first incidence of clinical TLS is reported.   
 Laboratory TLS Stopping Rule  
The incidence of laboratory T LS will be monitored with 12% being the benchmark based on IB. Operationally, the study 
accrual will be suspended if:  
−  1 patient experiences laboratory TLS when there have been ≤5 patients treated  
−  2 patients experience laboratory TLS when there have been ≤14 patients treated  
−  3 patients experience laboratory TLS regardless of the number of patients treated  
The rule is derived based on a <50% probability of the rule being triggered when the true laboratory TLS incidence is ≤12% .

2.1  Introduction/Rationale for Development  
2.1.1  Burden of disease  
Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) arise from post thymic lymphocytes, representing non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) in the western populations. Approximately 5,000 new cases of PTCL are diagnosed 
annually in the US [ 2]. Based on immunophenotyping, molecular, clinical and pathologic  feat ures, there 
are about 22 different subtypes of PTCL that are broadly classified into nodal, extranodal, leukemic variant 
and cutaneous T cell lymphomas ( CTCL) based on the site of origin of the disease [ 3, 4]. In North America, 
the most common subtypes are PTCL -not otherwise specified, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and 
angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) [5] .  
Most PTCL cases have a dismal prognosis with a 5 year survival of less than 30% with the exception of 
ALK+ ALCL. Anthracycline based combination therapies are the most common initial treatment u sed for 
PTCL but primary response rate is less than 60% and most patients relapse after initial therapy  [5]. There 
are now 4 FDA approved agents ( Table 2.1.1 ) for the treatment of PTCL in the relapsed setting in the US 
but none of them are curat ive. Other than  ALCL most patients with PTCL are in dire need for new and 
improved therapeutic options. Currently there are many agents that are being evaluated for relapsed and refractory PTCL.

2.2  BCL2 and Mature T -Cell Lymphomas  
The Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The Bcl- 2 oncogene 
was first identified in follicular lymphoma where the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation results in significant over- expression of the protein in B -cells. The Bcl -2 family of genes encodes a family of closely  
related proteins that possess either pro -apoptotic or anti- apoptotic activity and share up to f our Bcl-2 
Homology (BH) domains [ 11-14]. Bcl-2 over-expression is a major contributor to the pathogenes is of some 
types of lymphoid malignancies and has been extensively studied in B cell lymphomas, including CLL and 
DLBCL. Bcl -2 is also over- expressed in acute and chronic leukemias.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
is a genetic disease where the microRN As miR15a and miR16 -1 that negatively regulate the transcription 
of Bcl-2 are deleted or down -regulated, resulting in u ncontrolled expression of Bcl -2 [14]. 
Bcl-2 over-expression has been found to be associated with progression of various B cell lymphoid 
malignancies and is targetable with selective anti-  BCL2 therapy including Venetoclax resulting in 
meaningful  clinical responses in CLL and other B cell malignancies [ 15]. Similar studies have demonstrated 
over-expression of Bcl -2 in cases of CTCL  [16]. Using immunohistochemical methods on tissue samples

Version-Date 04-11/03/20 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 15 of 94 and a 10% cut off, Bcl- 2 was detected in 46% of cases in PTCL along with other members of the Bcl -2 family 
[17]. The expression pattern of the BCL family of pr oteins was variable, with a distinct pattern seen in only 
Alk +ALCL and EATCL that were Bcl- 2 negative and MCL -1 positive. Further studies conducted using a 
TUNEL assay and proliferation index revealed that the Bcl -2 family protein levels correlated with apoptotic 
rates and proliferation index. It was hypothesized that over- expression of these proteins may explain the 
poor response of the many types of PTCL to chemotherapy. A later study attempted to  correlate the 
expression of Bcl -2, Bax and p53 with progr ession of PTCL using paraffin -embedded specimens from 
patients [18]. These included CTCL. In this study, Bcl -2 over-expression was strongly associated with 
advanced stage and a high IPI index. Within the groups that over -expressed BcL2, p53 over -expression 
was associated with poor survival. The 3 year OS was 82% for Bcl- 2+/p53- cases and only  32% for Bcl -
2+/p53+ cases, indicating that Bcl- 2 over expression seemed to correlate with progression of PTCL through 
a p53-dependent pathway3. In studies of T -cell lymphoma at City of Hope , Bcl- 2 has been found to be 
expressed in 52 -76% of cases of PTCL  and 25% of CTCL [19, 20]  (unpublished data from Joo Song, City of 
Hope). Hence, there is strong rationale to consider that interference of the Bcl -2 pathway in PTCL and 
CTCL may be a favorable anti lymphoma target. So far there is no published data regarding the use of Bcl-
2 inhibitors in the treatment of peripheral T cell lymphomas  and cutaneous T cell lymphomas. We 
hypothesize that interference of BCL2  will lead to antitumor activity in mature T-cell lymphomas.  
2.3  Venetoclax  
Venetoclax (also known as ABT -199) is a novel, orally available, small molecule Bcl- 2 family protein 
inhibitor that binds with high affinity (Ki < 0.010 nM) to Bcl- 2 and with lower affinity to other Bcl- 2 family 
proteins such as B cl-xL and Bcl-w (> 4,000 -fold and > 2,000 - to > 20,000- fold lower affinity than to Bcl -2, 
respectively) [21]. Selective inhibition by venetoclax disrupts Bcl -2 signaling and rapidly induces multiple 
hallmarks of apoptotic cell death in Bcl- 2-dependent human tumor cell lines [22]. Importantly, venetoclax 
inhibition of Bcl- 2 is independent of p53 activity.  
Venetoclax  has been FDA approved for  patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p 
deletion, as detected by an FDA approved test, who have received at least one prior therapy .  
2.3.1  Pre-clinical experience  
Previous agents targeting Bcl -2 were non-specific and had inhibitory effects on BCL -XL  as well as BCL -w 
that resulted in significant clinical thrombocytopenia due to the role of  BCL-XL   in platelet survival  [23]. 
This led to the development of Venetoclax or ABT- 199 which has specific inhibition of Bcl -2 with platelet 
sparing effects with sub -nanomolar affinity to Bcl -2 (Ki < 0.010nM) and anti - tumor activity a gains NHL, 
CLL and acute leukemia in vitro  [21, 24, 25]. Multiple experiments demonstrate that venetoclax acts to 
induce apoptosis. As expected, venetoclax was ineffective against murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 
lacking Bax and Bak, essential mediators of the intrinsic apoptosis program.  However, in the Bcl- 2-
dependent ALL cell line RS 4;11, venetoclax rapidly induced key hallmarks of apoptosis, including cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and the externalization of phosphatidylserine.  
Venetoclax exhibited potent activity against patient -derived tumor cells treated ex vivo killing CLL cells 
with an average EC50 of 6.0 nM (N = 35) 
and AML cells with a median IC50 of 10 to 20 nM (N = 57). 
Venetoclax was equally potent against the subset of CLL samples bearing the high -risk 17p del, with an 
average EC50 of 0.008 µM (N = 5), indicating that venetoclax may hav e a significant utility in treating 
patients with this high -risk lesion. 
Venetoclax also demonstrated cell killing activity against lymphoma and 
leukemia cell lines including B- cell FLs, MCLs, DLBCLs, AMLs, ALLs, and MMs. 
Venetoclax was especially 
potent against cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl- 2. 
The majority of sensitive FL and DLBCL cell lines

Page 16 of 94 were positive for the t(14;18) chromosome translocation that drives high level expression of Bcl -2 from 
the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer.  Bcl -2 levels and the t(14;18) chromosome translocation thus 
represent potential predictive biomarkers for sensitivity to venetoclax. Venetoclax also demonstrated 
potent killing of MM cell lines and primary tumor samples bearing the t(11;14) translocation [26]. 
These 
cells tended to express high levels of Bcl -2 relative to Mcl- 1. 
Mouse xenograft studies showed activity 
against aggressive Myc positive lymphoma as well as acute leukemia [27, 28]. 
2.3.2  Clinical experience  
As of version 11  of the venetoclax Investigator's Brochure [ 29] a total of 2939  subjects received at least 
1 dose of venetoclax in AbbVie studies and had data available as of 28 November 201 8. Among these 2939 
subjects, 1313 subjects had CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL), 570  subjects had non -Hodgkin's 
lymphoma  (NHL), 218 subjects had multiple myeloma (MM), 361  had acute myeloid leukemia ( AML), 59 
subjects had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 20 subjects had acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 219 were healthy volunteers. A total of 1137  received the drug as monotherapy, and 1406 received the 
drug in combination with other therapies. Doses admini stered in venetoclax clinical studies have ranged 
from 20 mg to 1200 mg.  
The most common adverse events (incidence > 20%) reported for all subjects in monotherapy studies were nausea, diarrhea, neutropenia,  anemia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia . Infections, including 
serious infections, although also common with the underlying malignancies, have been reported with 
venetoclax treatment and their incidence is higher with combination treatments. The most common 
adverse events that were grade 3 and above were neutropenia ( 31.0%) and anemia (1 3.8%). The most 
common serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia and malignant neoplasm progression (5.7% 
each). The most common treatment emergent adverse event that led to death was malignant neoplasm 
progression (2.1%). 
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an important risk of Bcl -2 inhibitors, and is highest in CLL and MCL . As a 
result of on -target effects, the potential for TLS with venetoclax was identified early in the program when 
the initial 3 subjects with CLL/SLL  received starting doses of 100  mg or 200 mg and experienced TLS, which 
was reported as an adverse event for each. Subsequently, 2 fatal events in the setting of TLS and another event of clinical TLS in subjects with CLL/SLL occurred in December 2012. Afte r comprehensive review of 
all safety data available from studies with venetoclax, starting from May 2013, a revised dosing regimen with a dose -titration phase of 4 to 5 weeks and enhanced TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures were 
implemented in all CLL studies. In May 2014, a subsequent analysis of data from subjects with CLL/SLL 
following the implementation of prophylaxis measures, who completed monotherapy, indicated a marked 
reduction in severity and frequency of TLS when compared to the previous anal ysis. None of the subjects 
experienced any serious (including fatal) or non -serious events of clinical TLS or laboratory TLS or had 
study treatment discontinued because of TLS. Overall, the clinical data strongly support that the risk of TLS with venetocla x in CLL/SLL subjects is highest when initiating venetoclax dosing (5 week dose titration 
phase), as well as being greater in subjects with a large tumor burden. Currently, since May 2014, a more personalized approach for prophylaxis and monitoring measure s, where subjects with low tumor burden 
could receive venetoclax on an out -patient basis, has been implemented with no clinical TLS [ 30]. 
More specifically, in the Phase 1 study of venetoclax in CLL, the recommended Phase 2 dose (R2PD) of 
venetoclax was 400 mg per day. Given the risk of tumor lysis, dosing was ramped up weekly for 5 weeks 
(20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg). Among the 116  patients who received venetoclax on this study, 
the overall response rate was 79%, and complete remissions occurred in 20% of patients. The 15 month 
estimate for progression -free survival for those dosed at 400 mg was 69% [31]. Clinical tumor lysis

Page 17 of 94 syndrome did not occur in any of th e 60 patients treated in the expansion cohort of this study but did 
occur in 3 of the 56 patients treated in the Phase 1 portion of the study. There was one death due to 
tumor lysis in the dose escalation portion of the study.  
In the Phase 1  study of venetoclax in diffuse large B- cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, the RP2D 
dose was 1200 mg. In this study, there were two events of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome, but no 
patients had clinical tumor lysis. Therefore, in the expansion cohort portion for this study, dosing was ramped up weekly over 3 weeks (400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg). Of the 41 patients with diffuse large B -cell 
lymphoma, the overall response rate was 15% with a median duration of response of 3.3 months. Among the 29 patients with follicular lymphoma, the overall response rate was 34%, and the median duration of response was 10 months. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (44%), fatigue (44%), nausea 
(33%), and vomiting (23%). Serious adverse events included hyponatremia ( 4%), dehydration (3%), 
diarrhea (3%) , and febrile neutropenia (3%) [ 15, 32]. In diffuse large B- cell lymphoma, there is an ongoing 
trial evaluating the combination of venetoclax with rituximab or obin utuzumab plus CHOP  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . 
2.4  HDAC inhibition in mature  T cell lymphomas  
Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes t hat catalyze t he removal or acetyl groups from the lysine 
residues of various proteins, including histones and transcription factors. The transcription of genes is 
partially regulated by acetylation of nucleosomal histones. The core nucleosomal histones are the most widely studied of the proteins that become acetylated following inhibition of HDAC activity. [33] In some 
cancer cells there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic transcription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. Hypoacetylation of histone is 
associated with a condensed chromatin structure and repression of gene transcription.  
Inhibition of HDAC activity allows for the accumulation of acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues 
resulting in an open chromatin structure and transcription activation. HDAC inhibitors can induce tumor cell growth arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in animals. [34, 35] HDAC 
inhibitors as a class appear to have significant activity in T -cell lymphomas for reasons that are not clearly 
understood. HDAC inhibito rs work through several different mechanisms including alteration in the 
expression of genes that regulate cell cycle, acetylation of non -histone proteins that may impair their 
function to influence cell growth and survival, and by direct activation of apoptotic  pathways. [36] 
Attempts at understanding the mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors have involved gene expression profiling 
on paired tissue samples both pre - and post-treatment that have shown only 5 -10% of the genome can 
be affected. As many genes are unregulated as are down regulated following treatment with most HDAC 
inhibitors. The genes that were consistently affected included genes that alter cell cycle (CCND1, IGF1), 
apoptosis (septin10, TEF, SORBBS2), angiogenesis (GUCY1A1, ANGPT1), and immune modulation (LAIR1). 
[37] QT-PCR was used to confirm that the findings on the gene array anal ysis were indeed biologically 
accurate, with a strong correlation between gene array and the PCR data. Tumor tissue specimens treated 
with various HDAC inhibitors have shown an increase in histone acetylation, decreased vascularity, and 
translocation of nu clear proteins like STAT- s which is associated with inactivation. [38] 
2.5  Romidepsin  
Romidepsin (also known as Istodax®, FK228) is a HDAC inhibitor commercially available from Celgene. It is a unique HDAC inhibitor as it is a prodrug. Upon entering cells romidep sin is reduced to an active 
compound, capable of preferentially interacting with zinc in the active site of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Class I). [39] Romidepsin currently has FDA approval for patients with c utaneous T -cell lymphomas (CTCL)

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 18 of 94 that have received at least one prior therapy (as well as for relapsed/refractory PTCL). It is currently being 
assessed for the treatment of a variety of malignant and inflammatory diseases.  
2.5.1  Clinical Experience  
The clinical experience with romidepsin from multiple clinical trials has shown a well- tolerated toxicity 
profile. Phase 1 trials have provided the safety profile and dosing schedule. [ 40, 41] Romidepsin doses 
ranging from 1.0 to 24.9 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 4 hours have been investigated in 
treatment of advanced cancers. [42] A more standardized regimen has been defined as 14  mg/m2 
intravenously over a 4 hour period on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle. [ 7] The major hematologic 
toxicity includes anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Other common adverse 
events include gastrointestinal symptoms, constitutional symptoms, and dysgeusia. In addition, it was 
found that romidepsin may cause QTc prolongation/ECG changes, however, this may be the result of a 
drug:drug interaction with select antiemetics. Based on on -clinical findings, male and female fertility may 
be compromised by treatment with romidepsin.  
The use of r omidepsin is best established in CTCL. A phase 2 trial with romidepsin in relapsed CTCL showed 
single agent activity in patients that previously had been heavily pretreated with a median of 4 prior 
therapies. [43] A total of 7 1 patients were treated with an overall response rate (ORR) of 34% including 4 
patients with complete response. The median duration of response (DOR) was 13.7 months. This trial and 
a registration directed trial by Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, previous owne rs of romidepsin, led to full 
regulatory approval by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed CTCL. A phase 2 trial of romidepsin in patients with heavily treated relapsed/refractory PTCL demonstrated an ORR of 25% with median DOR lasting a somewhat remarkable 17 months. [7] The treatment regimen was romidepsin administered as a 
4-hour infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle with a dose of 1 4 mg/m
2. Based on this trial, 
romidepsin gained FDA approval in 2011 for used in relapsed/refractory PTCL.  
2.6  Combination of Bcl -2 inhibitors and HDACi  
There is a growing body of work suggesting that Bcl -2 inhibition and HDAC inhibition are synergistic  and 
therefore hold promise as combination therapy in lymphoma , where Bcl -2 prosurvival proteins are 
commonly overexpressed . In the Eμ-myc lymphoma cell  model the HDACi v orinostat and romidepsin  both 
mediated apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway , mediated by  the BH3-only proteins Bim and 
Bid.[44] These proteins  show tumor -suppressor function in certain contexts and inactivating mutations or 
loss of expression in human cancer samples have been reported. T ranscriptional activation of the 
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family BH3-only genes BIM , BMF, and NOXA is the apparent mec hanism of HDACi-
induced apoptosis . Selective knockdown of the three corresponding proteins rescued cells from 
vorinostat -induced apoptosis. Combined inhibition of Bc L2 members and HDAC is has shown synergistic 
effects in CTCL and other malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma and glioblastoma : vorinostat 
enhanced the activity of the BH3 -mimetic ABT -263 (navitoclax)  in MCL cells, leading to synergistic 
apoptosis induction .[45] Notably, overexpression of the prosurvival protein Bcl- 2, which inhibits activation 
of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, completely suppressed the apoptotic and therapeutic activities o f 
vorinostat . [46, 47] Another me chanism of pan HDACis panobinostat and vorinostat  to rapidly inhibit  
HDAC7 and induce  the expression and translocation of the proapoptotic nuclear orphan receptor Nur 77 
to the mitochondria where it binds to Bc l-2 and promotes apoptosis. Cotreatment with the Bc l-2/ Bcl xL 
antagonist ABT -737 decreased resistance and was synergistic with panobino stat in inducing apoptosis. [47] 
Higher sensitivity to venetoclax that correlates with higher levels of BcL -2 expression and mRNA has been 
seen in CTCL patient samples in vitro ,[48] similar to observations  in CLL. In addition, when these p atient

2.7  Overview and Rationale of  Study  Design  
This is an open -label multi -site Phase 2 study with a Safety Lead -in to test the safe ty and efficacy of 
venetoclax with romidepsin  for the treatment of relapsed/refractory  mature T-cell lymphoma.  
Eligibility 
Eligible patients will be adults with histologically  confirmed peripheral T -cell lymphoma as defined per the 
WHO criteria 2016 [49]. Eligible patients must be naïve to prior Bcl -2 therapies  and must have failed at 
least one prior systemic therapy.  
Treatment program  
Participants will receive venetoclax once daily orally, and romidepsin once a week for the first three weeks 
of each 28-days treatment cycle . Prior data suggest that B- cell NHL patients can tolerate up to 1200 
mg/day venetoclax [15, 32]. However, due to biologic differences in T cell and B cell lymphomas  and 
aggressive nature of T -cell disease , a maximum dose of 800 mg/day  will be tested  in this study . 
Romidepsin dosing will be according to the label.  
On-target effect of either romidepsin or venetoclax coul d lead to rapid cell death and pose a risk of TLS . 
Based on prior clinical experience with the agent , a ramp up dosing schedule will be implemented during 
Cycle 1. The venetoclax dose will be ramped up over 7 days , in line with current practice for AML [ 30]. 
Once the safety and tolerability of the proposed dose  combination  and schedule is established  after the 
safety lead -in, additional patients will be enrolled and treated for the Phase 2 response evaluation  using 
the same dose  combination  and schedule ( which includes  the ramp-up in Cycle 1) . 
Participants will continue with treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or completion 
of 26 cycles (~24 months) of therapy , whichever comes first. If a patient is still benefiting from treatment 
at the completion of  26 cycles of therapy, we will consider amending the study to extend the duratio n of 
therapy for that particular patient.  
Dose and Schedule:  
During Cycle 1, p articipants will take venetoclax 20 mg/day on Day 1, 50 mg/day on Day 2, 100 mg/day on 
Day 3, 200 mg/day on Day  4, 400 mg/day on Day 5, and 800 mg/day on Days 6-7 in the ramp -up phase 
and 800 mg/day on Days 8- 28. Romidepsin 14 mg/m2 will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of the  28-
day cycle.  
During Cycle 2+, participants will take 800 mg/day  venetoclax.  Romidepsin 14 mg/m2 will be administered 
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of e ach 28-day cycle.  
Safety Lead-in 
During the safety -lead in, up to 6 evaluable participants will be enrolled using a 3+3 design.  
In the event the proposed combination of venetoclax  (20-800 mg/day ) with romidepsin  is not tolerable 
(2+ patients with  unacceptable toxicity  in ≤ 6 evaluable participants), the accrual will be suspended and 
the study will be amended.  
Unacceptable toxicities will be evaluated during the first 2 cycles of therapy . This will ensure monitoring 
of participants during the ramp -up period (Cycle 1) and while p articipants are on steady -state dose (Cycle

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 20 of 94 2). Unacceptable toxicities will focus on commonly observed toxicities for venetoclax such as ne utropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, blood chemistries  and tumor lysis syndrome . 
Phase 2 
Once the Safety Lead -in is completed  and the proposed dose combination and schedule  (including ramp -
up) is confirmed safe and tolerable , additional patien ts will be enrolled and treated  for the Phase 2 
response evaluation. The Phase 2 portion will utilize  a Simon’s two -stage optimal design. Patients enrolled 
during the Safety Lead -in will be included in the Phase 2 portion of the study  if they are evaluable for 
response. In the absence of study holds to accrual for toxicity or for futility, accrual will co ntinue until 18 
evaluable participants are treated at the tolerated dose  and schedule . 
An early stopping rule for futility will be based on the response rate in the first 7 patients. Accrual may 
need to be temporarily held at 7  patients pending response evaluation .  
TLS Prophylaxis and Monitoring 
To mitigate the risk for TLS , all participants will initiate TLS prophylaxis  and undergo pre -dose and real-
time post-dose monitoring during the ramp-up stage (see Section 5.10.2) . Patients will be monitored for 
TLS on an outpatient basis for  the first 8 days of treatment.  
Response  
PTCL specific response assessment criteria per Lugano Classification will be used for this study [ 50]; these 
criteria incorporate PET for response assessment. PTCL is considered [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)  avid 
[51, 52] and PET-CT is recommended for staging of routinely FDG- avid histologies [ 50]. CT is preferred for 
low or variable FDG avidity.  
Radiographic imaging will occur every 2 cycles. E nding treatment due to disease progression will occur 
after completing at least two cycles of treatment. This is to ensure that pa rticipants have had enough time 
to be exposed to the steady -state venetoclax dose.  
Correlative studies  
Baseline and optional tumor tissue samples during Cycle 1 or 2 treatment  will be collected . Correlative 
studies will characterize the gene expression  profile in patient samples  and explore relevance to the Bcl -
2 pathway.  Additionally, these studies will explore  response to therapy and toxicity base d on the patient’s 
BCL-2 status.

5.0  TREATMENT PROGRAM  
5.1  Treatment Program Overview  
This is a multi- center, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 trial of venetoclax with romidepsin for patients with 
relapsed/refractory mature T-cell lymphoma . 
The study consists of a Safety Lead -in stage to evaluate safety/tolerability and a Phase 2 stage to evaluate 
anti-tumor activity in the study population  (Section 5.3 ). Participants will receive up to 26 cycles of therapy 
and each cycle will be 28 days.   
Protocol treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, completing 26 cycles of therapy, or meeting other Section 5.7  criteria, whichever comes first.  If a patient is still benefiting from 
treatment at the completion of  26 cycles of therapy, we will consider amending the study to extend the 
duration of t herapy for that particular patient.  
During Cycle 1 , all participants  will be monitored closely  for tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS, Section 5.9.2). 
Participants who discontinue protocol therapy will undergo follow -up (see Section 5.8). Windows for all 
assessments and treatments are detailed in Section 10.0 . 
5.2  Treatment Cycle Definition  
The treatment cycle will be a fixed 28 days  (Note: exceptions due to unusual operational considerations 
may be permitted as described in Section 6.2 ).  
The cycle day count and cycle count will continue despite a hold in venetoclax or romidepsin 
administration due to toxici ties (See Section 6.2 ) - i.e. a cycle may initiate even if either drug is being held .  
Cycle 1 Day 1 is defined as the first day of venetoclax  and romidepsin  administration.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 27 of 94 5.3  Treatment Plan  
Participants will ramp -up daily over the first week  of Cycle 1 to the maximum venetoclax dose. From Cycle 
1 Days 8-28 and Cycle 2+ Days 1 -28, participants will continue at the maximum dose (Figure 5.3 ) of 
venetoclax. Romidepsin 14 mg/m2 will be administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.  
Figure 5.3. Dosing Schedule  
 
5.3.1  Safety Lead -in 
During the safety -lead in, 6 evaluable participants will be enrolled using a 3+3 design. Unacceptable 
toxicities are  defined in Section 11.2  and will be evaluated during the first 2 cycles of therapy . 
In the event the proposed dose (20-800 mg/day)  of venetoclax plus romidepsin  is not tolerable ( 2+ 
participants with  unacceptable toxicity  in ≤ 6 evaluable participants), the accrual will be suspended and 
the study will be amended.  
5.3.2  Phase 2 
Once the Safety L ead-in is completed and the pr oposed dose  is shown to be tolerable , additional patients 
will be enrolled and treated for the Phase 2 resp onse evaluation. A Simon 2 -stage optimal design will be 
utilized. Patients enrolled during the Safety L ead-in will be included in the Phase 2 portion of the study  if 
they are evaluable for response . In the absence of study holds to accrual for toxicity or for futility, accrual 
will continue until 18 evaluable participants are treated . 
 See Section 12.0 for details.  
5.4  Agent Administration  
5.4.1  Venetoclax  
Participants must initiate TLS prophylaxis prior to initiating ve netoclax (refer to  Table 5.9.1 ). Delay 
initiating Cycle 1 Day 1 dose if the participant is experiencing laboratory TLS (see Appendix B ).  
Venetoclax  tablets should be taken orally once daily with  a meal with water. The tablets should be 
swallowed whole .

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 28 of 94 If a participant misses a dose and > 8  hours have passed since the scheduled dose time, the missed dose 
will be skipped and will not be made up.   
Doses that are vom ited will not be made up. Doses that are withheld due to toxicity will not be made up.  
Participants will be given a Pill Diary to document each dose of venetoclax  that is taken or missed 
(Appendix G ). 
Management and dose re ductions/delays associated with pr otocol-therapy related AEs, including TLS  are 
outlined in Section 6.2 . 
5.4.2  Romidepsin  
Romidepsin should be handled in a manner consistent with recommended safe procedures for handling 
cytotoxic drugs.  
Romidepsin must be reconstituted with the supplied diluent and further diluted with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP before intravenous i nfusion.  
Each 10 mg single-use vial of romidepsin must be reconstituted with  2mL of the supplied diluent. With a 
suitable syringe, aseptically withdraw 2  mL from the supplied Diluent vial, and slowly inject it into the 
romidepsin for injection vial. Swirl the contents of the vial until there are no visible particles in the 
resulting solution. The reconstituted solution will contain romidepsin 5  mg/mL. The reconst ituted 
romidepsin solution is chemically stable for at least 8 hours at room temperature. Howev er, whenever 
possible, drug should be prepared within 4 hours of dose administration.  
Extract the appropriate amount of romidepsin from the vials to deliver the desired dose, using proper 
aseptic technique. Before intravenous infusion, further dilute the romidepsin in 500m L 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP.  
Infuse over 4 hours. Patients  will receive romidepsin (at a dose of either 14 or 12  mg/m2 – see Section 7.2 
for details) IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. On these days it does not matter whether venetoclax is given before or after the romidepsin infusion.  
The diluted solution is compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene (PE) infusion bags as well as glass bottles. Romidepsin is stable for 24 hours at room temperature after reconstitution per package insert.   
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration, whenever solution and container permit.  
5.5  Assessments and Special Monitoring  
Section 10.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed. It may be necessary to perform study 
procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the investigator.  
Note the following:  
o  Review of s afety assessments must be performed within 72 hours  prior to the first 
venetoclax  administration  (Cycle 1 Day 1) . 
o  Cycle 1 Day 1-6 (venetoclax ramp- up stage) : The 24 hours post-dose laboratory values  must 
be reviewed prior to the next  venetoclax administrat ion.

Page 29 of 94 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)  
  There is a potential risk with both venetoclax and romidepsin for TLS in participants with 
PTCL, especially in those with renal dysfunction  and dehydration. In addition, on -target 
effect of venetoclax could lead to rapid cell death and pose a risk of TLS.  
  Patients will be closely monitored  for the first 8  days of treatment (Cycle 1, Days 1 -8) for 
signs and symptoms of TLS, laboratory evaluat ion, and appropriate intervention.  
−  Examples of TLS symptoms : fever, chills, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
diaphoresis, hypotension, muscle aches, weakness, paresthesias, mental status 
changes, confusion and sei zures.   
  If any clinical features are observed  (see Appendix B ), recheck potassium, phosphorus, 
uric acid, calcium and creatinine within 1 hour.  
  A rapidly rising serum potassium is a medical emergency.  
  TLS monitoring  during Cycle 1 and prophylaxis  are described in  Table 5.9.1 . 
5.6  Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
Participants will receive protocol therapy until one of the below criteria are met:  
o  Disease progression  
o  Completed 26 cycles (~24 months) of  protocol therapy 
o  Participant is deemed intolerant to protocol therapy because of toxicity, despite dose 
modification/ delay  
o  General or specific changes in the patient's condition which render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
o  Withdrawal of consent for further protocol therapy (see Section 16.5 ) 
Once participants meet criteria for removal from protocol therapy, the participant should then proceed to End of Treatment assessments.  If a patient is still benefiting from treatment at the completion of  26 
cycles of therapy, we will consider amending the study to extend the duration of therapy for that particular patient.  
Documentation of the reason  for discontinuing protocol therapy and the date effective should be made 
in the source documentation  and appropriate eCRF. The COH DCC should be promptly notified of the 
change in participant status.  
5.7  Follow -Up 
Following completion of protocol therapy, all participants will enter follow -up for up to 24 months after 
ending protocol treatment.  This is comprised of:  
o  Follow -up for safety - All participants will be followed until resolution or stabilization of 
reportable AEs occurring during protocol therapy or starting within 30 -days post last dose of 
protocol therapy. Refer to Section 7.7  for reporting details.  
o  Follow -up for response  for those who have yet to have disease progression.  
o  Follow -up for survival  - for those who initiated an anti- cancer therapy or have  disease 
progression . 
Assessment time points and windows are detailed in Section 10.0 .

o  Completion of study activities (treatment and follow -up) 
o  Participant withdrawal (see Section 16.5 ). 
o  Participant is lost to follow -up. All attempts to contact the participant must be documented.  
o  At the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons  
Documentation of the reason for discontinuing study participation and the date effective should be made 
in the medical record and appropriate eCRF. The COH DCC should be  promptly notified of the change in 
participant status.   
5.9  Supportive Care, Prohibited Medications and Concomitant Therapy   
Participants must be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over -the-counter 
products) during the trial without  prior consultation with the investigator .  
Participants should not consume  grapefruit, grapefruit products , Seville orange s (including marmalades  
containing Seville oranges) , or star fruits while receiving protocol therapy .  
With the exception of  prohibited therapies listed in Section 5. 9.1, participants should receive appropriate 
supportive care measures as deemed necessa ry by the treating investigator per institutional standards. 
TLS prophylaxis guide lines are detailed  in Section 5. 9.3. Examples of prohibited and cautionar y 
medications are listed in Appendix D. 
5.9.1  Prohibited and Cautionary Agents 
Prohibited Agents

be reviewed in real -time unless stated otherwise.****  
a Administer intravenous hydration for any patient who cannot tolerate oral hydration. IV hydration must be initiated 
the night before dosing and continued for 24 hours after dose.  
b Start allopurinol or xanthine oxidase inhibitor 2 to 3 days prior to initiation of venetoclax.  
c Evaluate blood chem istries (potassium, uric acid, inorganic phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine)  
d Pre-dose blood collection is to be performed  within 4 hours from venetoclax administration.  
 
The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial responses requir ed.  Any 
abnormal chemistry tests should be corrected promptly.  
If a diagnosis of TLS is established, ongoing intensive monitoring and multi -disciplinary management will 
be per institutional practice.  Refer to Table 7.2.1.

8.1.2  Description  
Structural Formula:  
 
Molecular Formula: C45H50ClN7O7S 
Molecular Weight:  868.44 kDa 
8.1.3  Mechanism of Action  
Venetoclax is a novel, orally available small molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that binds w ith > 500-
fold higher affinity to Bcl-2 and with lower affinity to other Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl- XL and Bcl -w. 
Overexpression of anti -apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is associated with increased resistance to 
chemotherapy, and antagonism of the action of these proteins might enhance response to such therapy 
and overcome resistance.  Anti -apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are associated with tumor initiation, 
disease progression, and drug resistance, making them compelling targets for antitumor therapy .  
8.1.4  Pharmacokinetics  
Half-life: ~26 hrs 
Distribution: Highly bound to plasma protein  
Metabolism:  Predominantly  by CYP3A4/5; M27 is a major metabolite

has been shown to induce hyperacetylation of histones and other nonhistone protein species resulting in a variety of phenotypic changes, induc tion of the upregulation of gene transcription, G1 and G2/M arrest 
of the cell cycle, morphological reversion of transformed cells, cell growth inhibition, apoptotic cell death, 
and inhibition of angiogenesis. In vitro, romidepsin causes the accumulation o f acetylated histones, and 
induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of some cancer cell lines with IC
50 values in the nanomolar range. 
The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of romidepsin observed in nonclinical and clinical studies has 
not been fully c haracterized.

Page 51 of 94 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Statistical  Design  
This is a multi- institution, single arm Phase 2 trial to evaluate the anti- tumor activity and safety/tolerability 
of venetoclax  with romidepsin  in patients with relapsed/refractory mature T -cell lymphoma. Patients will 
take oral v enetoclax daily and romidepsin on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle for up to 26 cycles (28- day 
cycle) Response will be assessed after every 2 cycles until disease relapse/progression. Patients will be 
followed for 24 months after the end of protocol treatment. The p rimary endpoint is overall response 
rate. Secondary endpoints include toxicities, CR rate, duration of response, time to response, PFS, and OS. 
The study will accrue up to 18 evaluable patients for the primary response endpoint evaluation. The first 
6 patients enrolled on the study will be part of a Safety Lead -in to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
the proposed dose of venetoclax with romidepsin as described below in Section 12.1.1 . 
12.1.1  Safety Lead -In 
Prior to formally  initiating the Phase 2  response evaluation , a patient Safety Lead -in will be conducted to 
ensure the proposed treatment is tolerable . Up to 6 evaluable patients may be enrolled in two cohorts of 
3 patients each  at the proposed venetoclax dose (maximum dose of 800 mg/day with a 1-week dose ramp 
up schedule)  plus romidepsin  as outlined below . Initially up to 3 evaluable patients can be enrolled and 
treated. After 3 pati ents are treated and evaluated for unacceptable toxicities , if 0/1 out of 3 eva luable 
patients experience unacceptable toxicities during the first 2 cycles , up to 3 additional  patients will be 
enrolled and treated to bring the total number of patients treated to 6. If ≤1/6 evaluable patients 
experience unacceptable toxicities during the first 2 cycles , the proposed treatment dose/schedule  
(including ramp -up) will be considered tolerable and be used for the subsequent Phase 2 response 
evaluation. At any time during the Safety Lead -in, if ≥2 patients experience unacceptable toxicities during 
the first 2 cycles , the accrual will be suspended and the study will be amended. The unacceptable toxicities 
are defined in Section 11.2 . Unacceptable toxicities will be evaluated during the firs t 2 cycles of therapy 
to ensure monitoring of participants during the venetoclax ramp-up period (Cycle 1) and while participants 
are on steady -state venetoclax dose (Cycle 2). Patients inevaluable for unacceptable toxicities during the 
Safety Lead-in will be replaced (see below in Section 12.3 ). 
12.1.2  Phase 2 
The Phase 2 response evaluation will accrue a minimum of 7  evaluable patients and a maximum of 18  
evaluable patients. Patients enrolled during the Safety Lead -in period of the study (n=6) will be included 
in the Phase 2 response evaluation provided that they are evaluable for response  (defined in Section 12.3 ). 
The response evaluation will be based on a Simon’s T wo-Stage Optimal design  [53], to distinguish a 
promising 30% response rate (alternative hypothesis) from a disappointing rate (null hypothesis) of 10%, 
at a one-sided type I error of 10% and a power of 80%. In the first stage, 7 evaluable  subjects will be 
accrued. If there is 0 response among the 7, the study accrual will be suspended . If there are 1 or more 
responses among the 7 , the study will remain open to accrue a total of 18 evaluable  patients. Observing 
4 or more responses among 18 evaluable patients will reject the null hypothesis and indicate the response 
rate being promising  in this study setting.   Observing 3 or fewer responses among 18 evaluable patients 
will fail to reject the null hypothesis and will not establish efficacy of the treatment.   
For the purpose of the 1st stage response evaluation, study a ccrual may be temporarily suspended until 
all Stage 1 enrollments are assessed for response after at least 4 cycles of treatment or are otherwise off-treatment. If by that time no responders have been observed, the study accrual will be terminated. On

Page 52 of 94 the other hand, if at least one responder has been observed prior to enrolling the 7th patient for Phase II, 
then Phase II accrual will continue directly to Stage 2 without interruption.   
If no toxicity is noted at the proposed dose /schedule and there is no e fficacy either, the protocol may be 
amended after discussion with the industry partner  to increase the maximum dose of venetoclax up to 
1200 mg/day. 
12.2 Accrual and Expected Duration of Trial  
The expected sample size for the Phase 2 response evaluation is 18 patients evaluable for response  
(assuming the response evaluation passes the first stage ). Patients enrolled during the Safety Lead -in of 
the romidepsin/venetoclax combination will be inclu ded in the Phase 2 response evaluation if t hey are 
evaluable for response  which requires a response evaluation after 2 cycles . We expect that all patient 
enrolled during safety lead -in will have a response evaluation after 2 cycles . Therefore, the total sa mple 
size for the study including the Safety Lead -in is expected to be 18 evaluable patients. Assuming 
approximately 10% of the patients need to be replaced for safety lead -in or Phase 2 evaluation, the 
maximum sample size for evaluating the combination of venetoclax and romidepsin is 20 patients.  
The 6 patients enrolled on the previous versions of protocols with single agent venetoclax will be analyzed 
separately and excluded from the main analyses which evaluate the combination of venetoclax and 
romidepsin. Therefore, the maximum sample size of the study will be 26 accounting for these 6 prior 
enrollments.  
City of Hope saw ~160 PTCL patients per year, with ~30 new patients per year (mix of newly diagnosed 
and relapsed or refractory).  This will be a multicenter study with 3 total sites. We expect a total accrual of 
1-2 patients per month across all sites. Therefore, accrual is expected to be completed in 24 months.  
Participant duration is planned for 4 years which includes  maximum time for treatment ( 24 months) and 
expected post- treatment follow -up (24 months). The estimated total study duration will be 6 years, with 
2 years of accrual and approximately 4 years of treatment and follow -up for the last patient.   
12.3  Evaluable Participants and Participant Replacement  
o  Evaluable fo r unacceptable toxicity during Safety L ead-in: Patients evaluable for 
unacceptable toxicity  (defined in Section 11.2 ) are: 
1)  Those who received at least 75% of the total  dose of each drug for  the first 2 cycles of 
therapy combined OR  
2)  Those who experience any unacceptable toxicity during the first 2 cycles  regardless of 
actual dose received.  
During safety lead -in, patients who are not evaluable for unacceptable toxicities will be replaced.  
o  Evaluable for response:  Patients evaluable for response are those who received at least 2 
cycles of protocol treatment and have a response evaluation after 2 cycles. Subjects who 
terminate treatment prior to 2 cycles due to disease relapse/ progression or unacceptable 
toxicity will be considered evaluable for response and be considered non -responders. 
Patients who terminate prior to 2 cycles for other reasons will be inevaluable for response. 
Patients not evaluable for response will be replac ed.

Page 53 of 94 12.4 Stopping Rules for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)  
Besides prophylaxis and dose modification for TLS per Section 5. 9.3 and Section 7.2, the study will 
implement accrual stopping rules for  both clinical TLS and laboratory TLS. When a stopping rule is 
triggered, the study PMT will review and assess the safety of the trial and s ubmit a report to the COH 
DSMC. The COH DSMC will review for approval any decision to continue or permanent ly suspend accrual 
to the trial.  
12.4.1  Clinical TLS  Stopping Rule  
Study accrual will be suspended when the first incidence of clinical TLS is reported .   
12.4.2  Laboratory TLS  Stopping Rule  
The incidence of laboratory TLS will be monitored with 12% being the benchmark based on IB. 
Operationally, the study accrual will be suspended if:  
•  1 patient experiences laboratory TLS when there have been ≤5 patients treated  
•  2 patients experience laboratory TLS when there have been ≤14 patients treated  
•  3 patients experience laboratory TLS regardless of the number of patients treated  
The rule is derived based on a <50% probability of the rule being triggered when the true laboratory TLS 
incidence is ≤12%.  
12.5 Statistical Analysis Methods  
Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics, including age, gender, medical history, and 
prior therapy, will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, descriptive 
statistics such as number, mean, standard deviation, standard error, median (range) etc. will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided.  
Rates and 95% Clopper -Pearson binomial confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for overall response 
rate (patients that have confirmed CR or PR), as well as for CR rate. Time to response, duration of response (only among subjects achieving CR/PR), overall surv ival, and progression -free survival will be estimated 
using the product -limit method of Kaplan - Meier with the Greenwood estimator of standard error. Median 
progression -free survival and overall survival and their corresponding 95% CIs  will be estimated. O bserved 
toxicities will be summarized  as summary statistics  in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory 
determination), severity, attribution, time of onset, duration, probable association with the study 
treatment , and reversibility of outcome.  
For the exploratory objective on determining the changes in Bcl -2 gene expression in pre - and post-
treatment tumor samples, summary statistics and plots will be used to describe the pre - and post-
treatment gene expression levels and the associated change between the timepoints.  Paired t-test or 
Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to explore the difference in gene expression levels before and after 
treatment. Data transformation such as log transformation will be considered if appropriate.  Exploratory 
analyses w ill be performed to investigate the association of the pre -/post-treatment Bcl -2 gene 
expressions and the change in gene expression with the clinical outcomes.  For the explorator y correlation 
of these gene expression level/change with response, analyses co mparing groups of participants defined 
by respon se may be conducted by two -sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test . For the exploratory 
correlation of these endpoints with survival outcomes, survival analysis techniques such as Log rank test 
will be used . Appropriate regression models will also be considered, such as logistic regression model for

14.1 Definitions  
14.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing condition that occurs 
during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related to the protocol intervention.  
14.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any expected or unexpected adverse events that result in any of the following 
outcomes:  
•  Death 
•  Is life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred) 
•  Unplanned hospitalization (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
•  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
•  A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
•  Secondary malignancy*  
•  Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias of convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
*Modified from 21 CFR 312.32 
14.1.3  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  
An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three of the following 
criteria: 
1.  Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved research 
protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
2.  Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused by the 
drugs, devices or procedures involved in the research); AND  
3.  Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.

Page 57 of 94 14.1.4  Adverse Events of Sp ecial Interest (AESI)  
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of standard safety 
monitoring activities. These events, regardless of seriousness, will be reported . 
14.1.4.1  Study Specific AESIs  
•  Tumor lysis syndrome (see Section 7.5 ) 
•  Overdose (see Section 7.6 ) 
14.2 Assessment of Adverse Events 
The site Investigator will be responsible for determining the event name, assessing the s everity (i.e. 
grade), expectedness, and attribution of all adverse events.  
14.2.1  Assessment of Adverse Event Name and Grade  
Adverse events will be characterized using the descriptions and grading scales found in the most recent version of CTCAE v. 5.0.  A copy of the scale can be found at NCI/ CTEP web site . The determination of 
severity for all other events not listed in the CTCAE v. 5.0 should be made by the investigator  based on 
medical judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 as defined below:  
•  Grade 1 (mild) –  An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usu al activities of daily 
living. 
•  Grade 2 (moderate) –  An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
•  Grade 3 (severe) – An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject.  
•  Grade 4 (life threatening) –  An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an 
imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the subject to perform activities of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc).  
•  Grade 5 (fatal) – Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
14.2.2  Assessment of Attribution  
The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the study agent or study procedure.  
•  Unrelated – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the participant.  
•  Unlikely – The event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
•  Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by othe r factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.

Version-Date 04-11/03/20 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 58 of 94 •  Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot be 
reasonably explained by other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
•  Definite – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably 
explained by other factors such as the particip ant’s condition, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant drugs, AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, improves 
upon stopping the drug, or reappears on re -exposure.   
14.2.3  Assessment of Expectedness  
The following definitions will be used to determine the expectedness of the event:   
•  Unexpected – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure 
and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; is not consistent wi th the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event. *Modified from 21 CFR 
312.32 (a)  
•  Expected – An adverse event is expected if it does not meet the criteria for an unexpected 
event, OR is an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event.   
14.3 Reporting of Adverse Events  
14.3.1  Routine Reporting of Non -Serious Adverse Events by Site Investigators  
Routine AE recording will oc cur via data entry into the study eCRF. Recording of adverse events will begin 
once the patient is consented and will continue until 30 days after the last dose of protocol therapy.  
Adverse events will be monitored by the P rotocol Management Team (PMT). Ad verse events that do not 
meet the criteria of serious OR are not unanticipated problems do not require expedited reporting.  AEs 
reported through expedited processes (i.e. reported to the IRB, DSMC, FDA, etc.) must also be reported 
in routine study data su bmissions.  
14.3.2  Expedited Reporting Requirements of SAEs and UPs by Site Investigators  
14.3.2.1  Criteria for Reporting SAEs/UPs to the Coordinating Center  
Serious Adverse Events meeting the criteria specified below will be reported to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours of notification that the event occurred.  
 Adverse events that require expedited reporting include:  
•  AEs or SAEs that meet the definition of an unanticipated problem  
•  AEs associated with  
o  TLS (Section 14.5) 
o  overdose ( Section 14.6), suspected abuse/ misuse,

14.4 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiat ion or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered 
a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
The investigator must immediately notify the Study PI/ DCC via an expedited report ( see Section 7.3.2 ). 
14.5 Tumor Lysis S yndrome  
The investigator must immediately notify the Study PI/ DCC via an expedited report any serious or non -
serious adverse events of TLS ( see Section 7.3.2).  
14.6 Overdose  
The maximum allowed daily dose of venetoclax i n this study is 800 mg, with the intention that participants 
move incrementally to this dose as described in the protocol.  
Any dose of study drug in excess of that specified in this protocol is considered to be an overdose.  Signs and symptoms of an overdo se that meet any Serious Adverse Event criterion must be reported as a Serious 
Adverse Event in the appropriate time frame and documented as clinical sequelae to an overdose.   
There is no specific antidote for venetoclax. In the event of an overdose, subjects should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.     
14.7 Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease 
state) of a female participant occurring after the participant receives the first dose of protocol therapy 
through up to 90 days post -last dose of venetoclax are considered immediately reportable events.  
Protocol therapy is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positi ve 
pregnancy test must be reported to the Study PI/ DCC immediately within 24 hours of awareness (see Section 7.3.2 ). The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist (preferably one with 
reproductive  toxicity experience) or another appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation.  
The Investigator should make every effort to follow the female participant until completion of the 
pregnancy per institutional policies, and should notify the Stud y PI/ DCC.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes and neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported as an SAE per expedited reporting guidelines (see Section 7.3.2 ).

Page 63 of 94 Any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to protocol 
therapy should also be reported as an SAE per expedited reporting guidelines (see Section 7.3.2 ) 
14.7.1  Male partic ipants 
If a female partner of a male participant becomes pregnant  within 90 days post -last dose, the male 
participant should notify the Investigator , and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their 
healthcare provider immediately.  
The Investigator should make every effort to follow the outcome of the pregnancy per institutional 
policies, and should notify the Study PI/ DCC.  
15.0 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND SINGLE SUBJECT EXCEPTIONS  
It is understood that deviations from the protocol should be avoide d, except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to a research participant. Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required because of travel delays, airport closures, inclement weather, family responsibilities, 
security alerts, govern ment holidays, and so forth. Delays can also extend to complications of disease or 
unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression. The PI has the discretion to deviate from the protocol when necessary so long as such a deviation does not th reaten patient safety or protocol 
scientific integrity. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the study staff 
and implemented promptly.  
15.1 Definitions  
15.1.1  Deviation 
A deviation is a divergence from a specific element of a protocol. Deviations from the protocol should be 
avoided, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazard(s) for the protection, safety, and well-being of a research participant . All protocol deviations and planned protocol deviations will be reported 
in accordance with the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation Policy. Protocol deviations may be on the part of the subject, the investigator, or the study staff.  
15.1.2  Planned Deviations ( Single Subject Exceptions)  
A planned deviation involves circumstances that could incr ease patient risk or alter protocol integrity , 
and require prior IRB approval of a single subject exception (SSE) request.   In addition, if contractually 
obligated, the sponsor must also approve the deviation.   An IRB pre-approved SSE protocol modification  
is considered an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation .   
15.2 Reporting of Deviations and SSEs  
15.2.1  Reporting Deviations  
For any deviation, the Investigator will notify the COH DSMC and IRB within 5 calendar days of its occurrence via iRIS in accordance with the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy .  
A list of deviations from all participating sites will be submitted along with the Protocol Management Team (PMT) progress report to the COH DSMC.  
 
For non-COH sites:  
o  The local IRB and/or DSMC must be notified according to local institutional policies.

notification of the event) via em ail to jazain@coh.org  and dcc@coh.org .  This email 
should provide input on the following:  
  Description of the event  
  Impact on participant safety or the safety to others  
  Impact on the s tudy design  
  A corrective and preventative action plan  
15.2.2  Reporting Single Subject Exceptions  
The SSE must be submitted as a “Single Subject Exception Amendment Request” via iRIS  in accordance 
with IRB guidelines and the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy .  An IRB approved SSE does not 
need to be submitted as a deviation to the DSMC.  
All non-emergency planned deviations from the  protocol must have prior approval by the Study Principal 
Investigator, the Site Principal Investigator, COH IRB, and when applicable, the local IRB.  In addition, if 
contractually obligated, the sponsor must also approve the deviation.

implementation of the stopping rules for safety/toxicity.  
 
The PMT is recommended to meet (in person or via teleconference) at least monthly to review study status. This review will include, but not be limited to, r eportable AEs and UPs, and an update of the 
ongoing study summary that describes study progress in terms of the study schema. The meeting will be 
a forum to discuss study related issues including accrual, SAE/AEs experienced, study response, 
deviations/vio lations and study management issues. The appropriateness of further subject enrollment 
and the specific intervention for subsequent subject enrollment are addressed. It is recommended that 
minutes of these discussions be taken to document the date of these  meetings, attendees and the issues 
that were discussed (in a general format).   
 
16.4 Monitoring  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights of human subjects are protected, that the 
study is implemented in accordance with the protocol and  regulatory requirements, and that the quality 
and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.  Monitoring for this study will be performed by the City of Hope Office of Clinical Trials Auditing and Monitoring (OCTAM) .  
 
The site In vestigator/Institution will permit the study monitors and appropriate regulatory authorities 
direct access to the study data and to the corresponding source data and documents to verify the accuracy 
of this data. The Investigator will allocate adequate tim e for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator 
will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic

Page 67 of 94 trials that are sponsored by City of Hope. The committee is composed of clinical specialists  with 
experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. The committee reviews the 
progress and safety of all active research protocols that are not monitored by another safety and data monitoring committee or board.  
 The Study Pri ncipal Investigator is required to submit periodic status reports (the PMT report) according 
to the guidelines outlined in the City of Hope Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan .  The PMT 
report will be submitted to the COH DSMC every 3 months  from the date of activation.   
 
The COH Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity and accrual data 
from this trial. The DSMC will review up -to-date parti cipant accrual; summary of all adverse events 
captured via routine and expedited reporting; a summary of deviations; any response information; monitoring reports, and summary comments provided by the study team. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request. For Phase I studies, a Phase I Tracking Log will be utilized and reviewed by the DSMC to monitor data and safety for dose escalation.  A review of outcome results 
(response, toxicity and adverse events) and factors external to the study (such as scientific or therapeutic developments) is discussed, and the Committee votes on the status of each study. Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Principal Investigator, statisti cian and 
study team. The PMT report and DSMC recommendations will be circulated to all participating sites for submission to their IRBs, in accordance with NIH guidance.

17.3 Institutional Review Board  
Each participating institution must provide for the review and approval of this protocol and the associated 
informed consent documents by an appropriate IRB holding a current US Federal wide Assurance issued 
by and registered with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  
Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, protocol 
amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, i nformation concerning patient recruitment, 
payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) will be submitted to the IRB.  The 
IRB’s written unconditional approval of the study protocol and the informed consent document will be in the possession of the Investigator, and, for sites external to COH, the possession of the coordinating 
center, before the study is initiated. The Investigator will obtain assurance of IRB/IEC compliance with regulations.  
The IRB will be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for review; serious 
unexpected or unanticipated adverse experiences occurring during the study, and any additional adverse 
experiences in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of th e IRB; new 
information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; an annual update and/or request for re -approval; and when the study has been completed.  
Any amendment to the protocol document and accompanying informe d consent document/template, as 
developed and provided by the Study PI, will require review and approval by the IRB before the changes are implemented in the study.  The protocol and consent will be reviewed and approved by the COH IRB before submission to  a participating site IRB.  
17.4 Informed Consent  
For a multi- site study, each participating institution will be provided with a model informed consent form. 
Each institution may revise or add information to comply with local and/or institutional requirements, b ut 
may not remove procedural or risk content from the model consent form. Furthermore, prior to submission to the IRB (initial submission and amendments), the consent and accompanying HIPAA form, if separate to the consent, must be reviewed and approved by  the DCC. 
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from either the patient or his/her guardian or legal representative before study participation.  The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent must comply with the ICH -GCP and 
all applicable regulatory requirements.  
Before implementing any study procedure, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB/IEC and signed and d ated by the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative at the time of consent.  A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to 
the patient or patient’s legally authorized representative.  The original signed consent must be maintain ed 
by the Site Investigator and available for inspection sponsor designated representatives, or regulatory 
authority at any time.  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual agreeing to participate in the study and continues thr oughout study participation.

Page 69 of 94 17.5 Participant Withdrawal  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice. The 
withdrawal must be documented per institutional policies. The COH DCC should be promptly notified of 
the change in participant status.   
Participant withdrawal may consist of any of the following with regard to study procedures and data 
collection:  
o  Withdrawal from study treatment, but agreement to continue with active study procedures and chart review and survival follow -up. 
o  Withdrawal from study treatment and all active procedures, but agreement for chart review and survival follow -up. 
o  Withdrawal from study treatment, all active procedures, and any future data collection.  
Participants who agreed to the collection  of research blood samples may withdraw consent to use their 
specimens, if they are not yet processed as detailed in the consent form.  Once the PI and site PI is notified 
of this withdrawal of informed consent, the research specimens will not be used in a ny research. At that 
time, any of the existing specimens will be destroyed.  
17.6 Special and Vulnerable Populations  
17.6.1  Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
The study is open anyone regardless of gender, race or ethnicity.  Efforts will be made to extend the 
accrual to a representative population. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic 
identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those differences more fully.   
Pregnant women are exclud ed because the effect of Bcl -2 inhibition on pregnancy has not been fully 
characterized . 
17.6.2  Exclusion of Pediatric Population  
Pediatric participants (< 18 years old of age) are excluded from this study since safety and effectiveness of protocol therapy has no t been defined for PTCL. Additional studies may be performed in the pediatric 
population once safety and effectiveness of protocol therapy is defined in the adult PTCL population.  
The incidence of PTCL is rare in the pediatric population . 
17.6.3  Inclusion of HIV Positive Individuals  
Patients with active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are excluded. Subjects who have an undetectable HIV viral load with CD4 > 200 and are on HAART medication are allowed.  
17.6.4  Vulnerable Populations  
45 CFR §46.111 (a)(3) and 45 CFR §46, Subparts B -D identifies children, prisoners, pregnant women, 
mentally incapacitated persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons as vulnerable populations.  
Adults lacking capacity to consent are not  excluded from participation. This study does not pose additional 
risks for adults lacking capacity than for the general population.  In such instances, informed consent will 
be sought and documented from the prospective participant’s legally authorized re presentative in 
agreement with institutional policies and local IRB approval.

Page 70 of 94 17.7 Participant Confidentiality  
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the investigators, study staff, and the sponsor(s) and 
their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples in addition to any study 
information relating to participants.  
This research will be conducted in compliance with federal and state requirements relating to protected 
health information (PHI), including the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  HIPAA regulations require a signed subject authorization informing 
the subject of the nature of the PHI to be collected, who will have access to that information and why, who will use or disclose that information, ant the rights of a research participant to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains t he ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation 
of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
Release of research results should preserve the privacy of medical information and must be carried out in accordance with Department of Health and Human Services Standards for Privacy of Individ ually 
Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR 164.508. When results of this study are reported in medical journals or at meetings, identification of those taking part will not be disclosed and no identifiers will be 
used.  
Medical records of subjects will be securely maintained in the strictest confidence, according to current 
legal requirements.  Data will be entered, analyzed and stored in encrypted, password protected, secure 
computers that meet all HIPAA requirements. All data capture records, drug acco untability records, study 
reports and communications will identify the patient by initials and the assigned patient number. Source 
documents provided to coordinating center for the purpose of auditing or monitoring will be de -identified 
and labeled with th e study number, subject ID, and if applicable patient initials.  
The investigator/institution will permit direct access to source data and documents by sponsor representatives, the FDA, and other applicable regulatory authorities.  The access may consist of  trial-
related monitoring, including remote monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC reviews, and FDA/regulatory authority 
inspections. The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the 
extent permitted by the applicable la ws and regulations.  
Participant specimens will be de -identified (coded) prior to submission to research laboratories. The 
specimens will be labeled with the study number, subject ID, date and timepoint of collection. The key to 
the code will be maintained in the COH clinical trials management system which is a secure environment.   
17.8 Use of Unused (Leftover) Specimens Collected for this Trial  
Unused samples in existence at study completion  (i.e. completion of all research activities under this 
study) will eit her be: (a) plac ed in a COH IRB approved biorepository with some clinical information and 
potentially PHI attached  or (b) discarded.   
With regard to which option will apply, each site IRB may choose to either: (a) leave the determination to the participan t via a question in the informed consent document, which would be communicated to 
the study registrar (DCC) at the time of participant registration, OR b) may choose to make a single 
determination on behalf of their respective participants, and communicate  that determination to their 
respective participants via the informed consent .

Page 77 of 94 APPENDIX C -1: PTCL -DISEASE PARAMETERS & METHODS OF EVALUATION AND RESPONSE  
Response will be assessed per Lugano Classification [ 50] 
Disease Parameters  
o  Measurable disease  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥15 mm (≥ 1.5 cm) by chest x -ray, CT scan, MRI, 
or calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).  
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable  
 
o  Malignant lymph nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]). At baseline a nd in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and 
followed. 
 
o  Non-measurable disease  
Pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm [≥1 to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non -
measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleur al/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
  Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, 
by definition, simple cysts.  
  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
o  Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, bu t in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, 
the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion which can be m easured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the 
diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of 
the disease.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 78 of 94 o  Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of dis ease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target 
lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as close ly as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more 
than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during f ollow-up. Imaging- based evaluation is preferred to evaluation 
by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical 
exam. 
o  Clinical lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion,  is recommended.  
 
o  Conventional CT and MRI  
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of th e scanning sequences 
used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with 
CT, the modality used at follow- up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions 
should be measured/assessed on the same pul se sequence. It is beyond the scope of the Lugano 
Classification [5] to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, 
and diseases. For this trial, MRI will not be used as standard imaging study for disease assessment.  
 
o  PET-CT at present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET- CT is not 
always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with Lugano Classification [5]. However, if the site 
can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time. Note, however , that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data 
which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.

Page 79 of 94 o  FDG-PET: While FDG- PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable 
to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can 
be identified according to the following algorithm:  
  Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based on a 
new lesion.  
  No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET at follow -
up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG- PET at 
follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are 
needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD 
will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan). If the positi ve FDG-PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the 
anatomic images, this is not PD.  
  FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases 
where a resi dual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use 
of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and 
supported by disease -specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be 
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice 
that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

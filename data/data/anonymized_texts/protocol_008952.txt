Title of study: Exacerbation Risk and Health Care Resource use among patients with 
asthma using ICS+Tiotropium versus I CS/LABA
Date: 05/12 2021
Version Number:1
Rationale and 
background:Regardless of severit y level, patients with uncontrolled asthma are prone to 
exacerbations, increased use of s ystemic corticosteroids, and rescue 
medications. Guidelines recommend increasing the dose of ICS product or 
use of ICS in combination with long -acting β2 -agonists (L ABA), and/or 
other add-on therapy  such as with a long -acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), biologics or oral 
corticosteroids. RCTs have found similar responses in terms of lung function 
and exacerbations between patients on I CS/Tiotropium a nd ICS/LABA. 
ICS/LABA is very  commonly  used in the real world since 2003, and 
Tiotropium was only  available in the US since 2016, so it’s important we 
generate real world evidence data complimenting the I CS/Tiotropium RCT 
data as an alternative to ICS/L ABA . It is important to evaluate the role of a 
LAMA in combination with I CS using real world data to support further 
treatment recommendations.
Research 
question and 
objectives:To conduct a comparative anal ysis of patients using Tiotropium in 
combination wi th Inhaled Corticosteroids (I CS) versus those that use LABA 
medication in combination with I CS.
Study design: This is a non- interventional study  based on existing data. Patients will be 
classified into two groups: 1. I CS+Tio and 2. ICS/LABA. We will record 
various baseline measures, including demographics such as gender, age, and 
region, comorbidity  level defined using Charlson Comorbidity  Index (CCI ), 
other specific comorbidities not included in the CCI, inhaled medication u se, 
ICS dose level, control level, and other listed measures. Using propensit y 
score matching (PSM) technique, we will develop matched cohorts of 
patients between the ICS+Tio and ICS/L ABA groups.   
Population: 1. ICS+Tio; and 2: ICS/LABA.

Regression
In addition to the key  independent variable of interest (ICS+TIO vs 
ICS/LABA group), we will include time vary ing medication exposure as a 
covariate in the regression.
Data sources: We will utilize medical and pharmacy  claim records from medical 
and pharmacy  claims data. This database is comprised of adjudicated 
claims for more than 150 million commercially  insured and Medicare lives 
in the US.
Study size: There are 25,291 patients with a prescription claim for tiotropium 
(1.25mcg, October 2015- May 2020) identified for anal ysis and 1,125,657 
patients with I CS/LABA prescription claims (July  2014 -May 2020). After 
excluding patients with COPD there are 17,882 patients in the Tio group 
and 921,804 patients in the I CS/LABA group. Further inclusion- exclusion 
criteria as well as restricting the Tio group to t hose with concurrent ICS 
monotherap y, will be applied to arrive at the final sample.

Data analysis Sample attrition at each step of the inclusion- exclusion criteria will be 
provided. We will develop the breakdown of the distribution of 
demographic, comorbidity , and baseline measures prior to and after the 
PSM (unmatched and matched cohorts). Significance of differences will 
be tested at P<0.05 for the matched cohort. Additionally , we will consider 
the use of standardized mean differences as noted abo ve, in which SMD 
<0.1 indicates balance. The primary  endpoint measure is time to first 
severe exacerbation and severe exacerbation will be defined as a 
hospitalization or an ER visit with a primary  diagnosis of asthma. We will 
calculate the time in day s tofirst exacerbation. We will conduct Cox 
proportional hazards modeling to estimate the risk of exacerbation and 
provide corresponding KM curves for the primary endpoint. Exposure to 
each of the study  comparators (ICS+Tio and ICS/LABA) will be recorded 
using time -varying covariates for all primary  and secondary  endpoints. 
ICS+Tio vs. ICS/LABA will be the key  independent variable and 
medication exposure will be a covariate included in the regression. 
Secondary  endpoints will include time (in days) to first mo derate -or-
severe exacerbation defined as use of s ystemic corticosteroid or a 
hospitalization or ER visit with a primary  diagnosis of asthma. Cox PH 
and KM curves will be conducted for this secondary  end point as well. We 
will also calculate and compare the rate of exacerbation, proportion of 
patients with exacerbations after 6 months and one y ear among the sub-
population of patients having at least 6 months and a one year of follow -
up, respectivel y. We will report rates in patient -years to account for 
varia ble follow- up time. We will also compare the mean monthly  (to 
account for variable follow -up time) per patient HCRU (all -cause and 
asthma related hospitalizations, ER visits, and outpatient visits) during the 
follow -up period, between the two groups. Proportions of patients with 
and without rescue medication use will be compared between the two 
groups as well.

7.RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
Asthma is associated with a significant burden on the healthcare s ystem. More than half the 
population of asthma patients remains uncontrolled despite therap y, and uncontrolled asthma 
is associated with greater economic and health care burden (Braido et al. 2013; Peters et al. 
2007). Stepwise treatment approach depending on control and severity  levels has been the 
corner stone of asthma therap y. Regardless of severity  level, patients with uncontrolled 
asthma are prone to exacerbations, increased use of systemic corticosteroids, rescue 
medications, deteriorating lung function (Chung et al. 2014), reduced quality  of life, and 
increased health care resource use. In such cases, guidelines recom mend increasing the dose 
of ICS product or use of ICS in combination with long -acting β2 -agonists (LABA), and/or 
other add- on therapy  such as with a long -acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), leukotriene 
receptor antagonists (LTRA), biologics or oral cortic osteroids. Treatment strategies that rel y 
on step treatment may not alway s be sufficient in controlling asthma. 
Given the unmet needs, other therapeutic options should be considered in this population. In 
investigating Tiotropium (Handihaler and Respimat) for the treatment of asthma, 6 clinical 
trials (found similar responses in lung function and exacerbations when comparing 
ICS/Tiotropium to I CS/LABA . In a randomized controlled trial of moderate asthma patients , 
Kerstjens et al 2015 reported a lower rate of exacerbations among patients with 
ICS/Tiotropium when compared to ICS/Salmeterol (ICS/LABA)   however formal 
comparisons could not be made since the ICS/salmeterol group was included to provide a 
standard add
-on active comparator and was not part of the inferential analy sis. Kerstjens et al 
study  concluded that “Once- daily tiotropium as add -on treatment to medium -dose inhaled 
corticosteroids provided significant improvements in lung function and asthma control that 
were similar to those recorded for twice -daily  salmeterol. In summary , RCTs have found

001-MCS -90-118_RD -23 (2.0) / Saved on: 02 Jul 2020similar responses in terms of lung function and exacerbations between patients on 
ICS/Tiotropium and I CS/LABA .
In 2020 NHLBI updated the Asthma guidelines recommending low dose ICS+L AMA as an 
alternative in Steps 3 and 4 noting that ”the majority  of LAMA studies use a comparative 
efficacy design and thus, their clinical impact is not well understood in real -world settings.” 
The NHLBI response highlighted the need for RWE to close this data gap. This proposed real 
world evidence ( RWE )study  will fill a data gap of assessing exacerbation differences with 
ICS/Tiotropium .  ICS/LABA is very  commonly  used in the real world since 2003, and 
Tiotropium was only  available in the US since 2016, so it’simportant we generate real world 
evidence data complimenting the ICS/Tiotropium RCT data as an al ternative to I CS/LABA 
using real world data to support further treatment recommendations.

To conduct a comparative anal ysis of patients using Tiotropium in combination with I nhaled 
Corticosteroids (ICS) versus those that use LABA medication in combination with I CS.
9.RESEARCH METHODS
      9.1 STUDY DESIGN
1.Patients with least twoasthma diagnosis (I CD 9 CM: 493.xx or I CD 10: J45-
J45.999) will be included. 
2.Patients will be required to be concurrentl y onICS+Tiotropium (specifically  
Tiotropium Respimat® 1.25 mcg) or ICS/LABA. 
3.Patients with least two diagnosis of COPD at any time during the study  period 
will be excluded.  
4.Patients less than 12years of age will be excluded.
5.Patients will be required to have enrollment for at least 6 months prior to 
ICS+ Tio or ICS/LABA use. 
6.Patients on biologics within 6 months prior to ICS+ Tio or ICS/LABA use will 
be excluded. 
7.Patients with prior 
Tio or ICS/LABA use during the 6- month baseline period
will be excluded.
8.Patients with urinary  bladder obstruction, urinary  retention, and glaucoma 
will be excluded.
9.After the PSM process, unmatched patie nts will be excluded.
Patients will be classified into two groups based on the exposure on the index date: 1. 
ICS+Tio; and 2: ICS /LABA. The date of concurrent medication initiation will be defined as 
the index date based on the date of the first prescript ion claim defining their add-on 
medication. We will record various baseline measures, including demographics such as 
gender, age, and region, comorbidity  level defined using Charlson Comorbidity  Index (CCI), 
other specific comorbidities not included in the CCI (Table 1 ), inhaled medication use, and 
control level as defined in Table 1. Additionall y, we will classify  patients based on their 
daily  ICS dose levels as ‘low dose I CS’, ‘medium dose I CS’, and ‘high dose I CS’. The dose 
levels will be assigned per GINA 2020 criteria (Global Initiative for Asthma. Global Strategy 
for Asthma Management and Prevention 2020). Medications that are available with only two 
dose level indications will be tagged as ‘low’ for the lower of the two 
dose levels, and ‘high’ 
for the highest dose level.

Using propensit y score matching (PSM) technique, we will develop matched cohorts of 
patients between the ICS+Tio and ICS/LABA groups. We will conduct 1:2 matching using 
nearest neighbor matching approach. Upon completion of matching, we will assess whether
the cohorts are balanced by examining the statistically significant differences at p<0.05. We 
will also assess balance by calculating standardized mean differences (SMD). An SMD <0.1 
will be considered balanced. Follow -up time will be calculated between index date and 
‘Censor date ’which will be defined as the date of either one of the following events : 1. Date 
of first exacerbation, 2. Date of medication switch, 3. Discontinuation of medication (define d 
as date of prescription claim plus days’ suppl y, plus 50% additional days), 4. Enrollment end 
date, or 5. Last date available in the dataset /End of study  period . In this “new user”, study 
design, primary  analysis will be 
an “as-treated ”analysis. In order to attribute events and 
outcomes to patients during the time that they are exposed to treatment (based on days-
supply  of prescription claims + a buffer window )as well as account for differences in inter -
group adherence levels , we will useatime-varying covariate approach to classify drug 
exposure t ime foreach comparator drug during follow up .This approach has been chosen to 
minimize biasbased on potentially  large differences in medication adherence rates , by only 
attributing outcomes to the time in which patients have medication in their possession based 
on days’ suppl y as described below .For each individual study  drug, we will identify  and

        9.4 DATA SOURCES
We will utilize medical and pharmacy  claim records from 
medical and pharmacy  claims data. This database is comprised of adjudicated claims for 
more than 150 million commercially  insured and Medicare lives in the US. Data between 
2014and 2020 will be extracted, with the first patient follow -up period for tiotr opium 1.25 
mcg dose patients starting in October of 2015.  This longitudinal database allows 
documentation and analysis of the patient journey  from diagnosis to intervention and follow -
up. The database includes patients in the majority  of three -digit zip c odes and in every  
metropolitan statistical area of the US.  It also covers data from 90% of US hospitals, 80% of 
all US doctors, and represents 85% of the Fortune 100 companies, with current HIPAA 
(Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability  Act) regul ations. The database is 
constructed from a variety of geographic regions and employer groups and maintains a level 
of diversity  while representing the overall trend in commercial health plan coverage. The 
underrepresentation of the population aged 65 yearsand older may  affect external validity  in 
the case of Medicare, Medicare Advantage or Medicaid patients.

There are25,291 patients with a prescription claim for tiotropium (1.25mcg , October 2015-
May 2020 ) identified for anal ysis and 1,125,657 patients with I CS/LABA prescription claims 
(July 2014- May 2020 ).After excluding patients with COPD there are 17,882 patients in the 
Tio group and 921,804 patients in the I CS/LABA group. Further inclusion- exclusion c riteria 
as well as restricting the Tio group to those with concurrent ICS monotherapy , will be applied 
to arrive at the final sample. 
       9.6 DATA MANAGEMENT
The data management plan is summarized below. Full details of the data management plan 
are documented in a separate NIS- Data Management and Review Plan (NIS -DMRP).
All established security and confidentiality procedures will be observed b y BI and/or 
 personnel who are assigned appropriate access to the data. Enrolment data, medical 
claims, and prescription claims will be accessed from the administrative claims dataset. The 
analyses will be performed on limited data sets that are void of member protected health 
information and all results were shared in aggregate form onl y.
        9.7 DATA ANALYSIS
        9.7.1 Main anal ysis
Sample attrition at each step of the inclusion
-exclusion criteria will be provided. We will 
develop the breakdown of the distribution of demographic, comorbidit y, and baseline 
measures prior to and after the PSM (unmatched and matched cohorts). Significance of 
differences will be tested at P<0.05 for the matched cohort. Additionally , we will consider the 
use of standardized mean differences as noted above, in which SMD <0.1 indicates balance
of baseline covariat es. The primary  endpoint measure is time to first severe exacerbation and 
severe exacerbation will be defined as ahospitalization or an ER visit with a primary  
diagnosis of asthma
. We will calculate the time in day s to first exacerbation. Also, as part of 
the primary  end point analy sis, w e will develop KM curves based on initial exposure and 
conduct 
time vary ing Cox proportional hazards modeling accounting for changes in exposure 
status over the follow up time to estimate the risk of exacerbatio nbetween ICS+Tio vs. 
ICS/LABA. Secondary  endpoints willinclude a number of measures. We will calculate the 
time in day s to first moderate -or-severe exacerbation defined as use of sy stemic 
corticosteroid or ahospitalization or ER visit with a primary dia gnosis of asthma . KM curves
based on initial exposure and time vary ing Cox PH 
models will be conducted for this 
secondary  end point as well. We willalso calculate and compare the rate of exacerbation, 
proportion of patients with exacerbations after 6 months and one year among the sub-
population of patients having at least 6 months and a y ear of follow -up, respectivel y. We will 
report rates in patient- years to account f or variable follow -up time. We will also compare the 
mean monthly  (to account for variable follow -up time) per patient HCRU (all -cause and 
asthma related hospitalizations, ER visits, and outpatient visits) during the follow -up period, 
between the two group s.Proportions of patients with and without rescue medication use will 
be compared between the two groups as well.

         No Adverse Events are anticipated to be identified in this study .
        9.8 QUALITY CONTROL
The quality  control, review, and monitoring plan are summarized below. Greater details are 
documented in the NIS -DMRP.
All programming will be quality  controlled b y two -step code checking b y . All 
results generated will be reviewed internall y by t wo co -investigators separately  prior to 
finalization.
        9.9LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METHODS
As with all s tudies utilizing claims data, there are certain limitations. The presence of a claim 
for a filled prescription or prescription absent claim does not indicate that the medication was 
consumed or that it was taken as prescribed. Medications filled over -the-counter or provided 
as samples b y the ph ysician will not be observed in the claims data. Patients with commercial 
health insurance may  be different from those with non -commercial or without (commercial) 
health insurance, and hence study  results may  not be g eneralizable to the overall population. 
Population aged 65 years and older might be underrepresented, which may  affect external 
validity  in the case of Medicare, Medicare Advantage or Medicaid patients. Socioeconomic 
data is not available and can affect as thma outcomes. Since unmatched patients will be 
excluded, the results may not be generalizable to all patients. Some study  measures and 
outcomes will include missing data and hence reduce the sample size. Patient 
misclassification, missing data, objective and reliable measurement of patient outcomes, and 
lack of detailed information regarding subjects’ clinical history  or clinical status during the 
study  timeframe may  undermine the accuracy  of our study  results.

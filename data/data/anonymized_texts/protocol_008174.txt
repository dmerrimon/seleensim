1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1 Soft Tissue Sarcomas 
 Soft-tissue sarcomas make up approximately 1% of adult malignan cies and encompass 
approximately 70 different histologic subtypes 
1.  Most of these tumors are genetically 
complex and are highly unlikely to share a common mutation or a lteration in signaling 
that would allow for treatment with an inhibitor to one molecul e across all subtypes.  
Surgery is usually the first line of treatment in localized dis ease, while radiation or 
chemotherapy can be used in local disease that is unresectable due to size or location.  
Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care for advance d and metastatic 
disease.  Doxorubicin is the most active single agent with a re sponse rate of 
approximately 20-25% 2.  In some instances, patients may not be a candidate for either 
one of these therapies based on age or other comorbidities leav ing no viable treatment 
options.  Prognosis is dismal in the metastatic setting with a median survival of less than 
12 months even with therapy.  
1.2 Pazopanib 
 
Pazopanib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has  been shown to have 
efficacy in sarcoma patients.   Preclinical data has demonstrat ed comparable inhibitory 
effects of pazopanib against a number of targets including VEGF R-1, VEGFR-2, 
VEGFR-3, PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, and c-Kit 
3.  In a phase II study published in JCO in 
2009, Sleijfer et al. demonstrated  that pazopanib is well-toler ated in patients with 
relapsed or refractory adv anced soft-tissue sarcoma 4.  Further, there is data from a phase 
III study of pazopanib in previously treated metastatic soft tissue sarcoma patients which demonstrated a progression free  survival of 4.6 months for pazo panib vs. 1.6 months for 
placebo.  Overall survival in the pazopanib group was 12.5 months 
5. 
 
1.3 Rationale 
 
Pazopanib is FDA approved as a second line and beyond treatment  for metastatic soft 
tissue sarcoma.  There is a population of elderly and debilitat ed soft tissue sarcoma 
patients that are not fit for standard first line chemotherapy that is doxorubicin based.  
As pazopanib is well tolerated with minimal side effects, we pr opose a phase II study to 
evaluate pazopanib as a first-line agent in patients with non-resectable or metastatic 
disease who are not candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
 
1.4 Background of Correlative Studies 
 
Sleijfer et al. recently published a translational study in whi ch they evaluated whether 
cytokine levels in the patients enrolled in EORTC 62043, the phase II study of pazopanib in soft tissue sarcoma, correlated with PFS and OS.  They measured levels of 
several cytokines at baseline and 12 weeks after beginning pazo panib therapy and 
demonstrated that baseline level s were not predictive, but that  high sVEGFR2 and low 
PIGF were associated with a more  favorable PFS at 12 weeks (OR 0.636, 95% CI 0.413-
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 9 of 52  0.977, P=0.039) and (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.007-1.160, P=0.0318) re spectively.  There 
was also a trend toward high sVEG FR2 at week 12 and increased O S and a statistically 
significant association between l ow PIGF levels at week 12 and longer OS (HR 1.061, 
95% CI 1.025-1.099, P=0.0009) 6. 
 
We propose to measure sVEGFR2 and PIGF levels at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks to both verify the results of Sleijfer et al and to de termine if there is an even 
earlier correlation that can be detected between levels of thes e cytokines and PFS as well 
as OS which may allow us to better  predict treatment response e arly on in therapy 
 In addition, plasma pazopanib concentrations will be determined  immediately prior to 
the first dose of each dose esca lation, then after steady-state  is reached at 800 mg QD 
(after at least 10 days of 800 mg QD administration). These PKs  will only be performed 
in the first 10-20 patients enrol led at Washington University.

1. Confirmation of patient eligibilit y by Washington University 
2. Registration of patient in the Siteman Cancer Center database 
3. Assignment of unique patient number (UPN) 
 Once the patient has been entered in the Siteman Cancer Center database, the WUSM 
coordinator will forward verification of enrollment and the UPN  via email. 
 
4.1 Confirmation of Patient Eligibility 
 
Confirm patient eligibility by collecting the information liste d below and scanning and 
emailing it to the research coordinator listed in the Siteman Cancer Center Clinical 
Trials Core Protocol Procedures for Secondary Sites packet at least one business day prior to registering patient: 
 
1. Your name and contact information (telephone number, fax number , and email 
address) 
2. Your site PI’s name, the registering MD’s name, and your instit ution name 
3. Patient’s race, sex, and DOB 
4. Three letters (or two letters a nd a dash) for the patient’s ini tials 
5. Currently approved protocol version date

9. Copy of appropriate source doc umentation confirming patient eli gibility 
 
4.2 Patient Registration in the Siteman Cancer Center Database 
 
Registrations may be submitted Monday through Friday between 8a m and 5pm CT. 
Urgent late afternoon or early morning enrollments should be pl anned in advance and 
coordinated with the Washington University research coordinator .  Registration will be 
confirmed by the research coordinator or his/her delegate by em ail within one business 
day. Verification of eligibilit y and registration should be kep t in the patient chart. 
 All patients at all sites  must be registered through the S iteman Cancer Center database a t 
Washington University . 
 
  
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 14 of 52  4.3 Assignment of UPN 
 
Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (U PN) for this study.  
Patients will also be identifie d by first, middle, and last ini tials.  If the patient has no 
middle initial, a dash will be used on the case report forms (C RFs).  All data will be 
recorded with this identificat ion number on the appropriate CRF s. 
 
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1 Agent Administration 
 
Pazopanib will be started at a dos e of 200 mg BID for four days, then escalated to a dose 
of 400 mg BID for four days (if to lerated), then escalated once  more to a dose of 800 mg 
QD for the duration of participa tion (if tolerated) or until do se reduction, if necessary.  
Pazopanib should be taken orally without food at least one hour  before or two hours 
after a meal. One cycle of pazopanib is 28 days.  The tablets s hould be swallowed whole 
and must not be crushed or broke n. The time of day the tablets are taken should be 
relatively constant.   If a dose is missed, the subject should take the dose as soon a s possible, but only if there 
are 12 or more hours remaining before the next dose is due. If the next dose is due in 
less than 12 hours, the subject should skip the missed dose and  take the next dose as 
scheduled.  If vomiting occurs after taking pazopanib, the subject should n ot take a replacement 
dose for that dose, but should resume taking pazopanib at the n ext scheduled dose.  If 
vomiting persists, the subject  should be instructed to notify t he investigator. 
 Please note that a Monday or Thursday start is recommended to a void weekend blood 
draws for pharmacokinetic testing.  
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
Patients should receive full s upportive care during the study, including transfusion of 
blood and blood products, and treat ment with antibiotics, analg esics, erythropoietin, or 
bisphosphonates, when appropriate. 
   Anti-emetics (such as prochlorperazine, lorazepam, ondansetron o r  o t h e r  5 - H T 3  
antagonists) may be administered  prophylactically in the event of nausea.  Anti-
diarrheals, such as loperamide, may be administered as needed i n the event of diarrhea.  
Although acetaminophen at doses of < 2 g/day is permitted, it s hould be used with 
caution in subjects with impaired liver function. 
   
5.2.1 Anticoagulants 
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 15 of 52  Results from drug-drug interact ion studies conducted in subject s with cancer 
suggest that pazopanib has no effect on the metabolism of S-war farin.  
Hemorrhagic events, however, have been reported in clinical studies with 
pazopanib; therefore, pazopanib s h o u l d  b e  u s e d  w i t h  c a u t i o n  i n  subjects with 
increased risk of severe bleeding or who are receiving concomit ant anticoagulant 
therapy (e.g., warfarin or its derivatives, low molecular weigh t heparin, 
unfractionated heparin).  Subjec ts taking concomitant anticoagu lant therapy 
should be monitored regularly for changes in relevant coagulati on parameters as 
clinically indicated, as well as  for any clinical  bleeding epis odes. 
 
5.2.2 Hypoglycemic Therapy 
 
Results from drug-drug interact ion studies conducted in subject s with cancer 
suggest that there will be no clinically relevant pharmacokinet ic interaction 
between pazopanib and hypoglycemic  agents.  Transient decreases  i n  s e r u m  
glucose (mainly Grade 1 and 2, rarely Grade 3) have been observ ed in clinical 
studies with pazopanib.  In addi tion, decreases in blood sugar have been recently 
reported in subjects treated with another small molecule tyrosi ne kinase 
inhibitor, sunitinib[31].  Such changes may require an adjustment in the dose of 
hypoglycemic and/or insulin therapy.  Subjects should be advise d to report 
symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., confusion, visual disturbances,  palpitations, 
sweating).  Serum glucose should be tested during treatment with pazopanib as 
outlined in the protocol and a s clinically indicated. 
 
5.2.3 Use of Statins 
 
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk  o f  A L T  
elevations.  If a patient receiv ing concomitant simvastatin dev elops ALT 
elevations, follow guidelines for pazopanib dose modification a nd discontinue 
simvastatin.  Insufficient data are available to assess the ris k of concomitant 
administration of alternativ e statins and pazopanib. 
 
5.2.4 Medications that Raise Gastric pH 
 
In a drug interaction trial in patients with solid tumors, conc omitant 
administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole, a proton pump in hibitor, 
decreased the exposure of pazopa nib by approximately 40% (AUC a nd Cmax).  
Therefore, concomitant use of pazopanib with drugs that raise g astric pH should 
be avoided.  IF such drugs are needed, short-acting antacids such as Tums, Rolaids, Maalox, and Mylanta should be considered in place of p roton pump 
inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists.  Separate antacid and p azopanib dosing 
by several hours to avoid a r eduction in pazopanib exposure. 
 
5.2.5 Medications to Use with Caution 
 
In vitro data indicate 
 that pazopanib is a  potential inhibitor for CYP3A 4, CP2C8, 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 16 of 52  CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP2E1.  
Pregnane X receptor transient transfection assay suggested some  potential for 
human CYP3A4 induction at high concentrations.  Results from dr ug-drug 
interaction studies conducted in subjects with cancer suggest t hat pazopanib is a 
weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6 in vivo , but had no clinically 
relevant effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 metabolism.  Therefore, 
concomitant use of pazopanib with certain medications (substrat es of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, and CYP2D6) with a narrow therapeutic window should be undertaken 
with CAUTION due to the potential for alterations in the pharmacologic effec ts 
of these medications or an increased risk for serious or life t hreatening adverse 
events associated with such medications (see below) secondary to the inhibition of specific CYP enzymes by pazo panib.  In addition, the potenti al for drug 
interaction with such medications, although diminished, may per sist after the last 
dose of pazopanib due to its long half-life (i.e., mean 30.9 ho urs); therefore, 
continue to exercise CAUTION  for at least 7 days and up to 15 days after the 
last dose of pazopanib when administering these medications.  T hese 
medications include ( but are not limited to): 
 Ergot derivatives:  dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine (potential increased risk for developing ergot  toxicity 
that includes severe vasospasm leading to peripheral as well as  cerebral 
ischemia) 
 Neuroleptics: pimozide (potential  increased risk for QT interva l 
prolongation, ventricular arr hythmia, and sudden death) 
 Antiarrhythmics: bepridil, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, amiodarone, 
quinidine, propafenone (potential increased risk for QT interva l 
prolongation and Torsade de Pointes) 
 Immune modulators: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus (potenti al 
increased risk for nephrotoxi city and neurotoxicity) 
 Miscellaneous: quetiapine, rispe ridone, clozapine, atomoxetine.  
 
The results from in vitro studies suggested that the oxidative metabolism of 
pazopanib in human liver microsomes is mediated primarily by CY P3A4, with 
minor contributions from CYP1A2  and CYP2C8.  Furthermore, in vitro data 
suggest that pazopanib is a substr ate for p-glycoprotein.  Subs tances that induce 
or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter the pharmacologic effects of pazopa nib and should 
be used with CAUTION .  
  
Medications that inhibit CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma pazopanib 
concentrations.  Co-administra tion of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is prohibited 
(see Section 5.2.5); therefore selection of a
 n alternate concom itant medication 
with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 is recommended.  
 CYP3A4 inducers may decrease pla sma pazopanib concentrations.  Selection of 
an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme i nduction 
potential is recommended.    
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 17 of 52  Drugs that induce CYP3A4 and may decrease pazopanib plasma conc entrations 
include (but are not limited to): 
 Glucocorticoids:  cortisone (>50 mg), hydrocortisone (>40 mg), 
prednisone (>10 mg), methylprednisolone (>8 mg), dexamethasone (>1.5 
mg) 
 Anticonvulsants:  phenytoin, carbamezepine, phenobarbital, oxca rbazepine 
 HIV antivirals:  efavirenz, nevirapine 
 Antibiotics:  rifampin (rifampic in), rifabutin, rifapentene 
 Miscellaneous:  St. John’s W ort, modafinil, pioglitazone  
 
5.2.6 Prohibited Medications 
 
Medications that inhibit CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma pazopanib 
concentrations; therefore, co- administration of strong CYP3A4 i nhibitors is 
PROHIBITED beginning 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug until  
discontinuation from the study.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include (but are 
not limited to):  
 
 Antibiotics: clarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin 
 HIV: protease inhibitors (ritona vir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir,  
lopinavir) 
 Antifungals:  itraconazole, ke toconazole, voriconazole 
 Antidepressants:   nefazodone 
 
Refer to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/  
 
In vitro studies suggested that pa zopanib is a substrate of P-g lycoprotein (P-gp) 
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Therefore, absorpt ion and 
subsequent elimination of paz opanib may be influenced by produc ts that affect 
P-gp and BCRP. 
 Concomitant treatment with str ong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP should be 
avoided due to risk of increased  exposure to pazopanib. Selecti on of alternative 
concomitant medicinal products  with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or 
BCRP should be considered. 
   
 
5.3 Women of Childbearing Potential 
 
Women of childbearing potential ( defined as women with regular menses, women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contrace ptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding, and women who have had a tubal l igation) are required 
to have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to  the first dose of 
pazopanib.   
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 18 of 52  Female patients are required to use two forms of acceptable con traception, including one 
barrier method, during participa tion in the study and for 28 da ys following the last dose 
of pazopanib.  
 If a patient is suspected to be pregnant, pazopanib should be i mmediately discontinued.  
In addition a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is 
confirmed that the patient is not  pregnant, the patient may res ume dosing. 
 If a female patient becomes pregnant during therapy or within 2 8 days after the last dose 
of pazopanib, the investigator m ust be notified in order to fac ilitate outcome follow-up. 
 
5.4 Duration of Therapy 
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continu e protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for d iscontinuation 
documented in the case report forms.  In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue indefinitely until one of the f ollowing criteria applies: 
 Documented and confirme d disease progression 
 Death 
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may  cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rul e out continuation of study drug 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render t he patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the inves tigator 
 Suspected pregnancy 
 Serious non-compliance with the study protocol 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Patient withdraws consent 
 Investigator removes the patient from study 
 The Siteman Cancer Center de cides to close the study 
 
Patients who prematurely discon tinue treatment for any reason o ther than withdrawal of 
consent will be followed as indicated in the s tudy calendar. 
 
5.5 Duration of Follow-up 
 
After cessation of study treatmen t, patients will be followed every 3 months until death.  
Either phone contact or review o f the Social Security Death Index is acceptable to 
monitor for overall survival. Pat ients removed from study for u nacceptable adverse 
events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
  
6.0 DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 19 of 52  As a general rule, if dose reduction of pazopanib is necessary,  the dose should be reduced 
stepwise by 200 mg at each step, and the patient should be moni tored for approximately 10 to 
14 days at each dose level.  If toxicity does not abate during this monitoring time, the pazopanib 
may need to be interrupted and/or the dose further decreased with continued monitoring for an 
additional 10-14 days at each dose level, and so on.   If the toxicity has abated with reduction of the dose and dose re-escalation is considered safe by 
the investigator, the pazopanib dose can then be increased step -wise back to the pre-event dose 
(in 200 mg increments, after monitoring for 10-14 days at each dose level to ensure that toxicity 
did not recur or worsen).

st occurrence – Liver Event Interruption Criteria: 
Step 1. Interrupt pazopanib until  toxicity resolves to < 
grade 1 or baseline.  Report the event to Novartis as an SAE 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurr ence.  Make every 
reasonable attempt to have subjects return to the clinic within 24 to 72 hours for repeat liver chemistries and liver 
event follow up assessments. Step 2. Liver imaging and other la boratory investigations 
should be considered as clinically appropriate. Step 3. Monitor subject closely for clinical signs and symptoms; perform full panel LFTs
 a weekly or more 
frequently if clinically ind icated until ALT is reduced to 
grade 1.   Step 4. If the subject is benefiting from the study treatment, re-treatment with pazopanib at 400 mg may be considered if ALL following criteria are met:  
- ALT reduced to Grade 1 
- Total bilirubin <1.5 x ULN or direct bilirubin 35% 
- No hypersensitivity signs or symptoms 
- Subject is benefiting from therapy.  
 
Recurrence – Liver Event Stopping Criteria: 
Discontinue pazopanib permanently and monitor subject closely for clinical signs and s ymptoms; perform full panel 
LFTs

bilirubin 2.0 x ULN; with 
direct bilirubin >35%) or with  
hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., fever, rash).  Liver Event Stopping Criteria: 
Step 1. Discontinue pazopanib imme diately; report the event 
to Novartis as an SAE within 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence.  Make every reasonabl e attempt to have subjects 
return to the clinic withi n 24 hours for repeat liver 
chemistries and liver event follow up assessments. Step 2. Consult a gastroentero logist / hepatologist and 
perform the following assessments to identify potential co-factors: 
- Eosinophil count - Viral serology for hepatitis A, B, C and E, 
cytomegalovirus, Epstein -Barr virus (IgM antibody, 
heterophile antibody, o r monospot testing)  
- Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, 
Type 1 anti-liver kidney mi crosomal antibodies. 
- Serum creatinine phosphokinase for possible muscle 
injury caused LFT elevation 
- Liver imaging - Consider toxicological blood screen for possible 
contributing chemical/medical entities  
Step 3. Monitor subject closely for clinical signs and symptoms; record the appearan ce or worsening of clinical 
symptoms of hepatitis, or hypers ensitivity, such as fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever rash or eosinophilia as r elevant on the AE report form.  
Perform full panel LFTs
a weekly or more frequently if 
clinically indicated until LF Ts are reduced to grade 1.   
For isolated total bilirubinb 
elevation without concurrent ALT increases (defined as ALT < 3 X ULN). Step 1. Isolated hyperbilirubinemi a (i.e., in the absence of 
elevated ALT or other signs/symptoms of liver injury) does not require dose modificati on.  Pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 
and OATP1B1, which can cau se elevation of indirect 
(unconjugated) bilirubin in the  absence of liver injury. 
Step 2. If bilirubin is >1. 5 x ULN in the absence of ALT 
elevation, fractionation of bilirubin elevation should be performed.  If bilirubin is >35% direct (conjugated), further evaluation for underlying cau se of cholestasis should be 
performed. 
a. Full panel LFTs include: AST, A LT, alkaline phosphatase, and to tal bilirubin.  Coagulation 
tests should be performed a s clinically indicated. 
b. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is  available.  If testing is 
unavailable and a subject meets th e criterion of total bilirubi n >1.5 x ULN, then the event 
should be promptly reported as an SAE.

7.4 Reporting Requirements for Secondary Sites 
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptl y notify the Washington 
University PI and research coordi nator of all reportable events  (as described in Section 
7.6) within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the eve nt or notification of the 
secondary site’s PI of the event.  This notification may take p lace via email if there is 
not yet enough information for a formal written report (using e ither an FDA MedWatch 
form if required or an institutional SAE reporting form if not) .  A formal written report 
must be sent to the Washington U niversity PI and research coord inator within 10 
working days  of the occurrence of the event  or notification of the secondary site’s PI of 
the event.  The death of a research participant that qualifies as a reportable event should 
be reported within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the 
secondary site’s PI of the event. 
 
The research team at a secondary  site is responsi ble for follow ing its site’s guidelines for 
reporting applicable events to its  site’s IRB according to its own institutional guidelines. 
The research team at Washington University is responsible for reporting all applicable events to the FDA.  
7.5 Reporting to Secondary Sites 
 
The Washington University PI (or designee) will notify the rese arch team at each 
secondary site of all reportable events that have occurred at o ther sites within 10 
working days  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the PI of the event.  This 
includes events that take place both at Washington University a nd at other secondary 
sites, if applicable.  
7.6 Reporting to Novartis 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is  an undesirable sign, symptom o r medical condition 
which: 
 
 is fatal or life-threatening 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
unless hospitalization is for: 
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (sp ecify what this  includes) 
 elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study and has no t worsened since the start  of study drug 
 treatment on 
an emergency outpatient basis for an event not ful filling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission 
 social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deteriora tion in the patient’s 
general condition 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 28 of 52   is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopar dizes the patient or 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above 
 
The principal investigator has the obligation to report all ser ious adverse events to the 
IRB and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epidemiology D epartment (DS&E) 
(For patients taking Pazopa nib / Novartis drugs). 
 To ensure patient safety, every S AE, regardless of suspected ca usality, occurring 
 
 after the patient has provided informed consent and until at le ast 30 days after the 
patient has stopped study treatment/participation 
 after protocol-specified procedures begin (e.g., placebo run-in , washout period, 
double-blind treatment, etc.) and 30 days after the patient has  stopped study 
treatment 
 after the start of any period in which the study protocol inter feres with the 
standard medical treatment given to a patient (e.g., treatment withdrawal during 
washout period, change in treatm ent to a fixed dose of concomit ant medication) 
and until 30 days after the pati ent has stopped study treatment  
 
All Events must be reported to  Novartis within 24 hours of lear ning of its occurrence. 
Information about all SAEs is co llected and recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a 
clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess and re cord the relationship of 
each SAE to each specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed , signed form by fax 
to (fax: 877-778-9739)  within 24 hours to the oncology Novartis DS&E department 
with the provided FAX cover sheets.  This includes serious, related, l abeled (expected) and serious,  related, unlabeled 
(unexpected) adverse experiences. All deaths during treatment or within 30 days 
following completion of active protocol therapy must be reporte d within 5 working 
days.  Any SAEs experienced after this 30 day period should only be re ported to Novartis if 
the investigator suspects a causa l relationship to the study dr ug. Recurrent episodes, 
complications, or progression of  t h e  i n i t i a l  S A E  m u s t  b e  r e p o r t ed as follow-up to the 
original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. 
A SAE occurring at a different tim e interval or otherwise consi dered completely 
unrelated to a previously re ported one should be reported separ ately as a new event.  The 
end date of the first eve nt must be provided. 
 The original copy of the SAE Re port and the fax confirmation sh eet must be kept within 
the Trial Master File at the study site.  
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 29 of 52  Follow-up information is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE Report Form 
was sent, using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a f ollow-up to the previously 
reported SAE, and giving the date of the original report. Each re-occurrence, 
complication, or progression of the original event should be re ported as a follow-up to 
that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow-up informat ion should describe 
whether the event has resolved o r continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind 
was broken or not (if applicable), and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  If the SAE is not previously documented in the Pazopanib Invest igator Brochure or 
Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to  the Novartis study drug, 
a DS&E associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for 
Health Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Inves tigator Notification (IN), 
to inform all investigators invo lved in any study with the same  drug that this SAE has 
been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions ( SUSARs) will be 
collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevan t ethics committees in 
accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulat ory requirements in 
participating countries.  To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the pa tient is on study 
treatment must be reported to N ovartis within 24 hours of learn ing of its occurrence. 
 
7.7 Timeframe for Reporting Required Events  
 
Reportable adverse events will be tracked for 30 days following  the last day of study 
treatment.

12.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
 
12.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors 
 
For the purposes of this study, pa tients should be re-evaluated  for response 8 weeks after 
initiation of pazopanib and then  every 8 weeks thereafter.  In addition to a baseline scan, 
confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 8 week s following initial 
documentation of objective response. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria i n Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 34 of 52  diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter 
in the case of malignant lymph node s are used in the RECIST cri teria. 
 
12.2 Disease Parameters 
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be reco rded) as >20 mm by 
chest x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by  clinical exam.  All 
tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT sca n (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline  and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 t o <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast 
disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-
measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criter ia for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are prefe rred for selection as target 
lesions.  Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should  be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the ne xt largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The basel ine sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor r egression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 35 of 52  Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurabl e 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these les ions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in r are cases unequivocal progression  of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken  and recorded in metric notatio n using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as clos ely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the b eginning of the 
treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are a ssessable by clinical exam. 
 Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they  a r e  
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin  nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x-ray:   Lesions on chest x-ray are accep table as measurable lesions w hen they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by a erated lung.  However, CT is  preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or  less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measu rable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain s ituations (e.g. for body 
scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast , spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables  involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measureme nt.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MR I is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as wi th CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the le sions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the  scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be f ollowed as closely as possible t o  p r i o r  s c a n s .   B o d y  
scans should be performed with br eath-hold scanning techniques,  if possible. 
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 36 of 52  PET-CT:   At present, the low dose or a ttenuation correction CT portion  of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal  d i a g n o s t i c  C T  q u a l i t y  f o r  u s e  w ith RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the s ite can document that the CT pe rformed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (w ith IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuri ng cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is  not routinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound:   U l t r a s o u n d  i s  n o t  u s e f u l  i n  a s s e s s m e n t  o f  l e s i o n  s i z e  a n d  s h o uld not be 
used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations canno t be reproduced in 
their entirety for independent review at a later date and, beca use they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about 
radiation exposure at CT, MRI m ay be used instead of CT in sele cted instances. 
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these t echniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be use ful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determin e relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete re sponse (CR) or surgical resecti on is an endpoint. 
 Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If ma rkers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize  f o r  a  p a t i e n t  t o  b e  
considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent pr ostate cancer) have been 
published [JNCI 96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461-3467, 1 999; J Clin Oncol 
26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with obj ective tumor assessment 
for use in first-line trials  in ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534-15 35, 2000]. 
 Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors , where known residual benign tu mors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any ef fusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met crit eria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response o r stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of  the treatment) and progressive  disease. 
 FDG-PET:   While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning  to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'n ew' disease).  New lesions 
on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorithm:  
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 37 of 52   Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow -up is a sign 
of PD based on a new lesion. 
 No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If  the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confi rmed by CT, 
this is PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confir med as a new site 
of disease on CT, additional fo llow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there 
is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of  PD will be the date of 
the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at  follow-up 
corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not  progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
 FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner s imilar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is th ought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by diseas e-specific 
medical literature for the indication.  However, it must be ack nowledged that 
both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitation s of FDG-PET 
and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means  one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surroundi ng tissue on the attenua tion corrected image. 
 
12.4 Response Criteria 
 
12.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must ha ve reduction in 
short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as ref erence the smallest sum on stud y (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of a t least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also consi dered 
progressions).  Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study. 
 
12.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 38 of 52  normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be n on-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis). 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initiall y above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non-PD:   Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existi ng non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not  a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is ex ceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circum stances, and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the r eview panel (or 
Principal Investigator). 
 
12.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as refer ence for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement 
of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in no n-target lesions may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
Note: Patients with a global dete rioration of health status req uiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported 
as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to  document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

*  ‘Non-CR/non-PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non-t arget disease since 
SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of effica cy in some trials so to 
assign this category when no lesi ons can be measured is not adv ised 
  
12.4.4 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whiche ver is first 
recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the sma llest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measuremen t criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as  reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, inc luding the 
baseline measurements.  
 
12.4.5 Progression-Free Survival 
 
Progression-free survival is defi ned as the duration of time fr o m  s t a r t  o f  
treatment to time of progressi on or death, which ever occurs fir st. 
 
12.4.6 Response Review 
 
It is strongly recommended that all responses be reviewed by an  expert(s) 
independent of the study a t the study’s completion.

Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 41 of 52  13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
 
In compliance with the Washingt on University Institutional Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan, 
the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will meet to re view toxicity data at least 
every 6 months following the activation of the first secondary site.  The report will be prepared 
by the statistician with assistance from the study team and wil l be submitted to the Quality 
Assurance and Safety Monitoring C ommittee (QASMC).  This report  will include: 
 
 HRPO protocol number, protocol ti tle, Principal Investigator na me, data coordinator 
name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician 
 Date of initial HRPO approval, d ate of most recent consent HRPO  approval/revision, 
date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, study st atus, and phase of 
study 
 History of study including summary of substantive amendments; s ummary of accrual 
suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol 
exceptions, error, or breach of  confidentiality including start /stop dates and reason 
 Study-wide target accrual and study-wide actual accrual includi ng numbers from 
participating sites 
 Protocol activation date a t each participating site 
 Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years at each 
participating site 
 Expected accrual end da te and accrual by site 
 Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number  of participants who 
have met each objective 
 Measures of efficacy 
 Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number o f participants who 
have met the early stopping rules 
 Summary of toxicities at all participating sites 
 Abstract submissions/publications 
 Summary of any recent literature t hat may affect the safety or ethics of the study 
 
Until such a time as the first secondary site activates this pr otocol, a semi-annual DSM report to 
be prepared by the study team will be submitted to the QASM Com mittee beginning 6 months 
after study activation at Washington University. 
 
The study principal investigator and Research Patient Coordinat or will monitor for serious 
toxicities on an ongoing basis. Once the principal investigator or Research Patient Coordinator 
becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE will be reported to t he HRPO and QASMC 
according to institutional guidelines.  A DSMC will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 clinical investigators and a biostatistician.  Like investigators, DSMC members are subject to the 
 Washington University 
School of Medicine policies rega rding standards of conduct. Ind ividuals invited to serve on the 
DSMC will disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the t rial principal investigator and/or 
appropriate university officials,  in accordance with institutio n policies. Potenti al conflicts that 
develop during a trial or a membe r’s tenure on a DSMC must also  be disclosed.  
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 42 of 52

14.0 AUDITING 
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each si te will be audited annually by 
Siteman Cancer Center personnel (QASMC) unless the outside inst itution has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copies of all audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit  notification will be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will ob tain the audit materials from 
the participa ting institution. 
 Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the 
audit. Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. 
However, if during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be asked to provide the additional charts within two working days. 
 Additional details regarding the Auditing Policies and procedur es can be found at

15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
15.1 Sample Size 
 
This is a single arm phase II trial. A single-stage design requ ires a total of 56 eligible 
patients to be enrolled in order to provide 81.64% power to tes t the desired 16 week 
clinical benefit rate (CBR) > 35% against an unfavorable CBR < 20% based on the exact 
binomial method at 5% significance  level (actual significance l evel = 4.32%).  Clinical 
benefit rate is defined as CBR = CR + PR + SD lasting ≥ 16 weeks.  If 17 or more patients benefit at the end of the trial, the treatment regimen  yields a higher clinical 
benefit rate and warrants further investigation.  
 
15.2 Statistical Analysis 
 
Clinical benefit rate will be calculated with 95% confidence in terval (CI) based on the 
Wilson score method and compared to the pre-specified unfavorab le CBR of 20% based 
on one-sided exact binomial test.  The serum levels of sVEGFR2 and PIGF at each time 
point will plotted and Pearson or  Spearman's correlation coeffi cient will be calculated to 
explore their relationship. PFS and OS in the overall cohort of  patients and by 
dichotomized sVEGFR2, PIGF and their combinations at each time point will be 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 43 of 52  analyzed and plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% CI. PF S and OS 
probabilities, overall and by group will be reported with 95% C I at desired time point. 
Cox proportional hazard model will  be used to report resulting hazard ratio and Wald 
test P-values on sVEGFR2 and P IGF in continuous format. 
 
 
16.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
 Washington University requires th at each participating site sen ds its informed consent 
document to be reviewed and approved by the Washington Universi ty Regulatory Coordinator 
(or designee) prior to IRB/IEC submission.     Site activation is defined as when the secondary site has recei ved official written documentation 
from the coordinating center that the site has been approved to  b e g i n  e n r o l l m e n t .   A t  a  
minimum, each participating institution must have the following  documents on file at 
Washington University pri or to study activation: 
 
 Documentation of IRB approval of the study in the form of a let ter or other official 
document from the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show 
which version of the protocol was approved by the IRB. 
 Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must 
include a statement that data will be shared with Washington Un iversity, including 
the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if 
applicable), and the Washington University study team. 
 Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572 (if applicable), and  signed and 
dated the CVs of all partic ipating investigators. 
 Protocol signature page signed an d dated by the investigator at  each participating 
site. 
 The coordinating center is res ponsible for disseminating to the participating sites all study 
updates, amendments, reportable adverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electr onically to the secondary sites  within 4 weeks of obtaining 
Washington University IRB appr oval.  Activated secondary sites are expected to submit 
protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt, unless 
otherwise noted.  Upon the second ary sites obtaining local IRB approval, documentation of 
such shall be sent to the Washington University study team with i n  2  w e e k s  o f  r e c e i p t  o f  
approval.  Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual co ntinuing reviews, protocol 
amendments or revisions, all SAE reports, and all protocol viol ations/deviations/exceptions 
must be kept on file at Washington University.  The investigator or a designee from each institution must parti cipate in a regular conference call 
to update and inform regarding the progress of the trial.

Name of Sponsor/Company:  Stratatech  Corporation , a Mallinckrodt Company  
Name of Investigational Product:  StrataGraft® Construct  
Name of Active Ingredient:  StrataGraft  is a viable  and metabolically active allogeneic human NIKS 
keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts cellularized layered scaffold .  
Protocol Number: MNK15011001  Phase: 3 Country:  US 
Title of Study: A Phase 3 Multicenter, Single Arm,  Open -label  Study Evaluating the Safety , 
Tolerability  and Efficacy of StrataGraft® Construct in Pediatric Subjects with Deep Partial -Thickness  
(DPT)  Thermal Burns  
Study center(s):  Approximately  10 sites 
Objectives:  
Primary:  To evaluate whether StrataGraft treatment promotes wound closure and reduces or 
eliminates the need for donor site harvest and autografting in a pediatric population with thermal 
burns that contain intact dermal elements and for which autografting would be  part of standard of 
care (deep partial -thickness [DPT] burns).  
Study Design:  This is a prospective, open -label, single  -arm, age -stratified study to examine the 
safety and efficacy of StrataGraft construct in the treatment of pediatric subjects with therm al burns 
that contain intact dermal elements and for which autografting would be part of standard of care  (deep 
partial -thickness [DPT ] burns ). This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of StrataGraft 
in the treatment of DPT thermal burns, d efined as those that contain intact dermal elements and for 
which excision/debridement and autografting are clinically indicated . 
Methodology: Approximately 50  subjects will be enrolled into one of two age -based cohort s: 2 to < 
12 years ( up to  n = 40) and 12 to ≤ 17 years (up to n = 10). The proposed study population will 
include pediatric subjects with thermal injuries covering no more than 30% of their total b ody surface 
area (TBSA)  with at least 0.5% TBSA DPT thermal burn . Each subject must also have a sufficient 
area of healthy skin available for use as a donor site in the event that autografting is clinically 
necessary. Study assessments will include the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including wound 
infection, and additionally monitor ing of  vital signs, clinical laboratory values, immunological values 
(where possible), wound closure, including any autografting, and skin quality of the treatment site .  
Number of patients (planned): Approximately 50 subjects are planned to be enrolled.

1. Aged 2 through  17 years, inclusive, at the time of consent  
2. Written informed consent from parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and a ssent from the child when 
appropriate, as determined by the Institutional Review Board ( IRB), consistent with 
regulatory criteria and requirements.  
3. Sufficient healthy skin available and reserved as a donor site in the ev ent that the StrataGraft 
treatment site requires autografting.  
4. Thermal burns of no more than a total of 30% TBSA.  
5. Consenting adult(s) is/are able and willing to attend/bring child to the scheduled visits and 
comply with study procedures.  
6. Study treatment  sites that are DPT in depth (ie, containing dermal elements)  and for which 
excision and autografting are clinically indicated  as assessed by the investigator, and located 
on the torso or extremities.  
7. Study treatment area (s) totaling 0.5% to 10% TBSA  and may  be composed of up to 3 non -
contiguous areas located on the same extremity or plane of the torso . 
Main criteria for exclusion: Subjects may not be or have:   
1. Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy and/or systemic corticosteroids  (inhaled 
corticosteroids are permitted) .  
2. Concurrent trauma, conditions, and/or personal situations that, in the opinion of the 
investigator, may compromise subject safety or the study objectives.  
3. A burn injury that occurred ≥ 14 days prior to planned Str ataGraft application.  
4. A proposed  study  treatment  site that has been previously excised or autografted ; located 
adjacent to an undebrided/unexcised burn area ; demonstrates signs and symptoms of wound 
infection, per judgement of the clinical investigator ; lies across joints or is located on the feet 
(ie, distal to the malleolus), hands (distal to the wrist), face, neck, buttocks, perineum, or 
genitalia.  
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration: The investigational product is 
StrataGraft® Construct, a rectangular cellularized sheet approximately 100  cm2, applied topically by 
the investigator  following excision/debridement of the treatment site . 
Duration of treatment: Following a screening period of up to 14 days  following burn injury , 
qualified  subjects will be enrolled and receive a single application of StrataGraft to 0.5% to 10% 
TBSA  following debridement of non -viable tissue . Subjects will return to the clinic for visits weekly 
until confirmation of complete wound closure. Follow -up vi sits will be conducted at Week 12 and 
Month s 6 and 12. Subjects will participate in the study for approximately 13 months, not including 
the screening period of up to 14 days.  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration: Not applicable.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary efficacy endpoint:  Percentage of subjects achieving confirmed complete closure of 
StrataGraft treatment sites on or before Week 12  without autograft placement. Confirmed complete 
wound closure is defined as complete skin re -epithelialization confirmed at 2 consecutive visits at 
least 2 weeks apart , but no later than We ek 20 .

Page 7 of 75 Secondary ranked efficacy endpoints : 
1. Mean of averaged  percent area of StrataGraft treatment site s per subject  closed at Week 12  
without autograft placement  
2. Number (%) of StrataGraft treatment sites with confirmed complete wound closure without 
autograft placement o n or before Week 12  
3. Mean of averaged percent area of StrataGraft treatment sites autografted per subject by Week 
12 
Exploratory endpoints and assessments:  
• Mean percent area of StrataGraft treatment site closed without autograft placement at Week  8 
• Mean Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) observer total score at Week 12, 
and Months  6 and 12.  
• Changes in skin quality outcome (POSAS and Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire 
[PSAQ] scores) across time.  
• Incidence and severity of pain at the treatment site  using  EVENDOL ( Evaluation E nfant 
Douleur, ie, Evaluation of Child Pain; observer or parent) or FPRS (Wong -Baker Faces Pain 
Rating Scale with 6 faces with expressions denoting degrees of pain; subject) ov er time.  
• Percent of subjects with complete closure of StrataGraft treatment site without autografting at 
Weeks 6 and 8 and Months 6 and 12.  
• Time to complete closure following application of StrataGraft.  
• Mean percent wound closure over time from Day 21 th rough Month 12 . 
• Percent of subjects achieving and maintaining persistent wound closure at Months 6 and 12.  
• Mean scar satisfaction based on PSAQ scores at  Week 12 and  Months  6 and 12.  
Safety:  The assessment of subject safety will consist of monitoring treat ment -emergent adverse 
events, adverse events of special interest, serious adverse events, vital signs, and w ound -related 
adverse events, including infection, throughout the study duration.  These data will be episodically 
reviewed by a Data Monitoring Commi ttee (DMC ). Safety laboratory values (complete blood count 
with differential and  comprehensive metabolic panel)  will be measured along with panel reactive 
antibodies (PRA) and anti -bovine serum albumin (BSA) antibodies.  
Statistical Overview : This pediatric study plans to enroll up to 50 subjects  into one of two age 
cohorts : 2 to < 12 years ( up to n = 40) and 12 to ≤ 17 years (up to n = 10). Analyses will be performed 
as the overall population . Analyses by age cohort  will also  be performed . 
For the primary endpoint, number (%) and 95% confidence interval ( CI) will be summarized based on 
the Intent -to-Treat population. Subjects with missing data will be imputed as nonresponders. The 
summary will also be performed based on all observed data, ie , excluding any missing data.  
After the primary endpoint is successfully achieved, the ranked secondary efficacy endpoints will 
each be tested in a hierarchical manner in their ranked order , using  a 2-sided confidence interval with 
0.05 Type I error .  
• The averaged percent area closed per subject will be calculated as, “Sum of percent area 
closed across treatment sites for a subject/the number of treatment sites on that subject”  
• The percentage of StrataGraft treatment sites with confirmed complete wound closure 
without autograft placement on or before Week 12 will be calculated as [(Total number of 
StrataGraft treatment sites with confirmed complete wound closure without autograft ing on 
or before Week 12/Total number of treatment sites) x 100]

4.1. Background  
Burn -related injuries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Nearly a quarter 
of all burn injuries occur in children under the age of 16  years , most in children under the age of  
5 years  (Krishnamoorthy, 2012 ; Kramer, 2010 ). Every day in the U nited States, more than 
300 children (age  from  0 to 19 years ) are treated for burn injuries in  emergency departments , and 
2 children die as a consequence of their burn injury  (Borse, 2008 ). Approximately 90% of 
pediatric burns are caused by household accidents , with scald burns being most common 
amongst younger children and flame burns most c ommon in the older child  (National Burn 
Repository, 2019 ). Further, far more children under the age of 12 years are burned than are 
adolescents.

Source: Figure 11, National Burn Repository, 2019 . 
Although wound healing and wound management do not differ between adults and children, 
there are differences between children and adults that may significantly affect  how pediatric burn 
patients are managed. Young children have nearly 3 times the surface area  to body mass ratio of 
adults, so they experience greater evaporative water losses and , hence , require greater fluid 
replacement.  This difference in the surface area  to body mass ratio also predisposes the child to 
hypothermia and increases their thermogenic metabolic demand. Finally, because of 
disproportionately thin skin in children, a burn that may initially appear to be partial thickness 
may instead declare itself t o be full thickness within a  day or 2 of injury, making burn depth 
assessment difficult.

Page 17 of 75 After stabilization of the critical care issues in the burn -injured child, attention is directed toward 
burn wound management. The ultimate aim of wound management in burns is to prevent wound 
infection and facilitate closure of the wounds, either spontaneously or by autologous skin grafts.  
Key elements of burn wound management include cleansing, debridement or surgical excision, 
topical antimicrobial agents, and dressi ngs. 
Regardless of the age of the patient, evidence suggests that early excision of burn eschar is 
effective in decreasing morbidity, improving the mortality rate , and reducing length of stay  
(Pietsch, 1985 ; Muller, 1994 ; Herndon, 1989 ), as well as hospital costs  (Munster, 1994 ). Deep 
partial  thickness (DPT) burns that  are expected to  take longer than 3 weeks to heal and full -
thickness burns (with the exception of very small injuries) should be grafted, as this reduces 
hypertrophic scarring and results in better cosmesis  (Heimbach, 1987 ; Chipp, 2017 ).  
Excised areas are usually closed with autograft or with allograft, xenograft , or other skin  
substitute until autograft is available or the wound spontaneously closes.  Availability of 
autologous donor tissue , however, is limited by the extent of the burn injury . In larger injuries, 
donor sites are often harvested  repeatedly , increasing the likelihood of scarring at those sites.  
Further, the simple harvest of a donor site incurs acute pain as well as the potential for infection 
and scarring.  As such, methods to reduc e the amount of donor tissue needed to achieve wound 
closure are always sought.  
StrataGraft is a viable, bioengineered,  allogeneic , cellularized scaffold product  composed of a 
differentiated epidermal compartment  compris ed of  epidermal cells from a single  human donor 
grown on a dermal equivalent comp osed of purified Type I animal collagen containing normal 
human fibroblasts from a second donor. The viable cells of StrataGraft produce and secrete a 
variety of growth factors, cytokines, and antimicrobial pep tides . These factors  are known  to be 
involved in wound repair and tissue regeneration.  
4.2. Study Rationale  
StrataGraft is under development by Stratatech  Corporation , a Mallinckrodt Company, as an 
alternative to autografting to promote the healing of acute the rmal burns.  A Biologic s Licens e 
Application for StrataGraft for the treatment of adults with thermal burns containing intact 
dermal elements for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated (DPT burns) has received 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approval . Data from a Phase  3 study  in adults  
demonstrate d that 83% of  wounds treated with a single application of StrataGraft achieve d 
durable closure at Month 3  without autografting  (Holmes, 2020 ). For th at study, durable wound 
closure was defined as closure at 2  consecutive visits at least 2 weeks , but not more than 5 
months  apart and including or encompassing the Month 3 time point . Subjects with missing data 
were considered to have failed the endpoint.  
Treating DPT  burns with StrataGraft rather than autografting  may be particularly beneficial for 
pediatric burn patients . This study is being conducted in order to  evaluate the safety a nd efficacy 
of StrataGraft treatment  in pediatric subjects with DPT  burn inj uries .

Page 18 of 75 4.3. Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
Results to date in adults indicate that treatment with StrataGraft is well tolerated and no acute 
immune response has been reporte d. The most common ly reported  adverse event s (AEs) 
associated with StrataGraft are pruritus , blister , and hypertrophic scar .  
Subjects in this study will undergo surgical excision /debridement  of nonviable tissue in the burn 
wound . The risks associated with this procedure  include pain and bleeding at the surgical site as 
well as potential complications of anesthesia, such as nausea/vomiting, chills, and sore throat.  
All procedur es and activities in this study, other than the actual application of StrataGraft, are 
generally accepted as standard of care for patients with thermal burns and are not considered to 
present any potential increased risk to the subjects.  More detailed info rmation about the known 
and expected benefit, risks, and reasonably expected AE s can be found in the StrataGraft 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.4. Xenotransplantation Considerations  
StrataGraft  is a xenotransplantation product because in the past, one of the cell types used to 
make StrataGraft  was grown with mouse cells. The cell banks have been tested and found to be 
free of detectable infectious agents and mouse cells are no longer used in the manufacture of 
StrataGraft . There have been no identified health concerns associated with these mouse cells.   
Recipients of xenotransplantation products are generally not eligible , per federal regulations,  to 
donate whole blood, blood components, source p lasma or source leukocytes. However, 
individual blood banks may request an exception  from FDA . StrataGraft recipients wishing to 
donate blood or blood products should check with their donation center. StrataGraft recipients 
who otherwise meet the donor req uirements are eligible to donate human cells, tissues, breast 
milk, ova, sperm, or body parts for transplantation.  
A small amount of blood (3 mL), called an archival sample, will be collected before StrataGraft 
application. This sample could be used as a b aseline to assess health issues that may be related to 
treatment. These samples will be used only for the purpose of responding to a request from FDA. 
Both archival samples and any associated subject  information will be stored and used only as 
required and  allowed by law.

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a prospective, open -label, single arm  study to examine the safety , tolerability  and clinical 
efficacy of StrataG raft in the treatment of DPT thermal burns in pediatric subjects . The study 
population will include pediatric subjects ages 2 to 17 years, inclusive, with thermal burns  that 
contain intact dermal elements and for which autografting would be part of standard of care . As 
previously discussed, far more pre -school and school -aged children are burned than adolescent s. 
Qualified subjects will be enrolled into one of two age -based  cohorts : 2 to < 12 years ( up to 
n=40) and 12  to ≤ 17 years (up to n=10).   
Informed consent  will be obtained from parents/guardians and assent  from the child , whe n 
appropriate, as determined by the IRB and consistent with regulatory criteria and requirements 
before any protocol -related assessments or procedures are conducted.  After  consent is provided, 
data collected during the course of admission and routine  assessment may be  abstracted from the 
medical record and  used for study purposes.  
Following a screening period of up to 14 days, subjects will be enrolled and r eceive a single 
application of StrataGraft to  0.5% to 10% total body surface area ( TBSA ), which may be 
composed of up to 3 non -contiguous areas located on the same extremity or plane of the torso.  
Subjects will return to for weekly visits until complete wound  closure  of all study treatment sites 
is confirmed . Follow -up visits will be conducted at  Week 12 and Month s 6 and 12 . Subjects will 
participate in the study for approximately 13 months, not including  the screening period of up to 
14 days.  The Schedule of Study Events is provided in Table  2.  
The duration of the study from first subject first visit to last subject last visit will depend upon 
the ability of the sites to identify and enroll eligible subjects. The study is expected to enroll 
subjects over a period of 12 to 18 month s. The e ntire study is expected to require approximately 
2.5 years to complete.  
Safety  assessments will include monitoring incidence of AE s, wound -related events, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory values (where possible ), immunological markers (where possible ), wound 
closure, pain , and scarring.  
Subjects will undergo baseline assessment s including a targeted physical examination an d 
collection of clinical laboratory assessments during  Screening. After enrollment and StrataGraft 
application, wound asses sments , photographs,  and solicitation of AEs will be performed at each 
study visit  via telephone  or video  interaction  if the subject is  unable to attend the visit . However, 
wound closure may only be assessed at face-to-face visits. If not collected during Screening, 
clinical laboratory samples will be collected via venipuncture performed prior to StrataGraft 
application on Day 1. Immuno logical samples (monitoring of PRA and anti-BSA antibodies) will 
be collected prior to StrataGraft application , and again  between Week  6 and Month 6 for all 
treated subjects . 
A subject’s study participation ends after the Month 12 visit.  However, during the study period , 
should a subject return to the investigator  for a follow -up visit not scheduled for the purpose s of 
the study, the investigator , when feasible,  will record any update on the subject’s wound status

forms provided  for such an Unscheduled visit . 
6.2. Study Design Rational e  
Deep partial thickness  and full thickness burns that are expected to take longer than 3 weeks to 
heal are usually autografted, as this reduces the incidence of hypertrophic scarring and results in 
better cosmesis  (Heimbach, 1987 ; Chipp, 2017 ). Donor sites are painful and patients have 
rema rked that they are more painful than the burn injury itself (Romanelli, 2019 ; Sinha, 2017 ). 
Availability of autologous donor tissue is limited by the extent of the burn injury, and in larger 
injuries, donor sites may be  repeatedly harvested, increasing the likelih ood of scarring at those 
sites.  
Clinical data  from the STRATA2016 pivotal study of  StrataGraft use for promoting the closure 
of DPT thermal burns in adult subjects demonstrate d that more than 95% of subjects achieved 
closure without autografting after treatment with StrataGraft, thereby obviating the harvest of 
autograft and the pain asso ciated with donor sites .   
6.3. Treatment Rationale  
StrataGraft is a  viable, bioengineered , allogeneic , cellularized scaffold product  that is anticipated 
to provide immediate wound coverage, aid in wound bed conditioning, and promote autologous 
tissue regeneration and wound closure while reducing or eliminating the need to harvest 
autologous donor tissue in adults.  
Recent clinical data in adults demonstrate that treatment of DPT  thermal burns with StrataGraft 
results in wound closure while reducing or eliminating the need for autograft.  Although similar 
to the pivotal study in adults  (ie, STRATA2016) , this study of pediatric subjects will recruit not 
only younger subjects (ie, no t adults) but also subjects with smaller TBSA burn. The reduced 
TBSA burn in pediatric subjects reflects the greater surface area to mass ratio of children 
compared to adults and the accompanying fluid status lability, limited physiologic reserves, as 
well as the reduced body size and attendant challenges.  
The present  study is being conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of StrataGraft in pediatric 
subjects with thermal burns containing dermal elements to better understand the product profile 
in a ped iatric population.  
6.4. Study Stopping Rules  
In this study, the medical monitor as well as the DMC  will assess safety  and efficacy . The DMC  
will be independent of study conduct  and their activities governed by a Charter .  
Subject enrollment may be paused  pendin g discussion with the DMC  if any of the following  
events  occur:  
• Unexpected infection at the StrataGraft  treated site  that is possibly or probably related 
to StrataGraft  and is an SAE.   
• Severe acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to StrataGraft .  
• Death attributed to StrataGraft .

Page 23 of 75 In the event that one or more  of the above occurs, the Sponsor  will be notified , per timelines  in 
Section  11.12 . The medical monitor will review the safety data associated with the adverse 
reaction with the clinical investigator and generate a summary narrative.  The medical monitor 
and DMC  will conduct a comprehensive review of the safety data , prior to resumption of subject 
enrollment.  
6.5. End of Study Definition  
A subject is considered to have completed the study if the subject has completed the Month  12 
follow -up visit.  The end of the study is defined as the completion of the final assessment for  the 
last subject enrolled in the study . 
6.6. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Due to the nature of the study product and dressing requirements  through the Day 7 visit, 
discontinuation of study investigational tissue product may not be feasible unless the subject 
manifests an adverse  reaction within 7 to 10 days of application.  
6.7. Subject Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Subjects are free t o withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time. If a 
subject/parent/guardian decides to discontinue subject’s participation, the reason(s) for 
discontinuation will be documented.  
A subject’s participation may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator, if 
the subject is uncooperative, is noncompliant, or the investigator feels that it is in the subject’s 
best interest to be withdrawn from the study. Additionally, the subject may be considered lost to 
follow -up after 3 documented attempts are made to contact the subject.  
All study data from withdrawn or discontinued subjects will be retained and used in the final 
study analyses. Subjects withdrawn or discontinued from the study may be replaced and a new 
subje ct number assigned.

Page 37 of 75 11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
All study assessments and times are listed in the Schedule of Study Events ( Section  6.8). General 
instructions for the administration of these assessments are provided in the following 
subsections. Additional (unscheduled) safety assessments may be performed as needed.  Specific 
instructions and questionnaires/forms (where appropriate) will be provided in a study manual. 
All assessments will be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
It is expected the subjects will attend all scheduled study visits. Should a subject be unable to 
participate in an in -person visit, wound assessments  and solicitation of AEs may be performed 
by telemedicine/video interactions. However, no assessment of wo und re -epithelialization nor 
observation or confirmation of closure may be performed via video/telemedicine visits. These 
wound assessments may be performed only during a face -to-face visit.  
11.1. Informed Consent/Assent  
The parents and/or guardians of minor chi ldren must provide written consent for the participation 
of their child/ward in this study prior to any study assessment.  Only informed consent forms 
reviewed and approved by the IRB of record may be used.   
Minor children will be assessed for their level o f comprehension and involved in the consent 
process as appropriate. For purposes of this study , assent to participate will be obtained from the 
child, when appropriate, as determined by the IRB, and consistent with regulatory criteria and 
requirements.  
Subjects who reach the age of majority (usually 18 years of age) during their participation in the 
study will be re -consented.  
11.2. Screening Assessments  
The screening period is a maximum of 14 days from the day of injury to Day 1. The screening 
assessments wil l help to determine eligibility for study enrollment. During this period, the 
prospective study sites will be managed nonoperatively per the institution’s standard of care . 
Subjects and/or parent/guardian will provide informed consent prior to any study -specific 
assessments being performed.  If, following excision/ debridement , the designated potential study 
site does not meet eligibility criteria, the subjec t will be considered a screen failure and no 
further assessments or study procedures will be performed . Only after excision/debridement  of 
the study site and application of StrataGraft will the subject be considered “enrolled .” 
11.2.1.  Medical History and Physical Examination  
Significant medical history will be collected using an abbreviated review of systems with  
particular attention to any previous surgical procedures performed, hospitalizations, diagnosed 
chronic conditions and any routinely administered medications.  The date of last menstrual period 
will be collected from post -menarche females.  
The physical examination will be performed to include evaluation of lungs, heart, abdomen, and 
extremities.  The findings of the physical examination will be recorded.

Page 38 of 75 Finally, background on the injury itself, including the date of the burn, date of first 
hospitalization,  and etiology of the burn  will be collected.   
11.2.2.  Pregnancy Test  
A pregnancy test will be conducted for females of child -bearing potential.  Results must be 
available prior to Day  1. Subjects with positive results at Screening are excluded from 
participation in this study.  Serum testing is preferred, but urine testing is acceptable.  
If applicable, the subject’s agreement to use contraception throug hout their study participation  
will be documented  (see Appendix 3 ).  
11.2.3.  Height and Body Weight  
The screening height and body weight measurements will be  used to calculate body surface area.  
Height and body weight will be obtained at certain study visits as indicated in the Schedule of 
Study Events ( Section  6.8). 
11.2.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be obtained with the subject at rest and will include systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures, pulse rate, r espiratory rate, and body temperature. The results, date, and time for all 
vital sign assessments will be recorded.  Any change from the S creening vital signs that is 
considered clinically significant by the investigator will be recorded as an AE.  
11.3. Study Sit e Assessments  
11.3.1.  StrataGraft Appli cation  
On Day 1, following excision/debridement of study burn wound(s), the treatment site(s) will be 
identified  and following fenestration/meshing, sheet(s) of StrataGraft will be applied and 
secured. The number of StrataGra ft constructs  applied to each treatment site will be documented . 
Details are provided in the Manual of Procedures . 
11.3.2.  Wound Closure Assessment  
After excision/debridement  and application of study treatments, the investigator  will examine the 
study site(s) as per the Schedule of Study Events ( Section  6.8) and visually assess wound 
closure, documenting a quantitative assess ment  of the proportion of  the wound that is 
re-epithelialized . For this study, confirmed compl ete wound closure is defined as , “complete  
re-epithelialization  of the wound without drainage”  observed at 2 consecutive visits  at least 2 
weeks apart  (FDA, 2006 ), but no later than Week 20 .  
11.3.3.  Area of the Study  Sites Autografted  
The area of each StrataGraft treatment site that is autografted will be measure d during the 
autografting procedure.  Details about obtaining wound measurement s is provided in the Manual 
of Procedures.

Page 39 of 75 11.3.4.  Photography of Treatment Sites  
All StrataGraft treated sites will be photographed in the operating room and at each study visit  to 
seria lly assess the area(s) of open wound in each treatment site. The photographer will be a 
trained study team member or trained caregiver.  Subjects will atte nd weekly visits until complete 
wound closure is confirmed . Following  confirmed complete  wound closure , or if subjects cannot 
attend the study site,  subjects and/or caregivers will be asked to photograph their wounds  so that  
ongoing closure of their wound(s) can be assessed.  In the event of a wound -related adverse 
event, photos of the affected wound will b e taken to help document the event. Specific 
instructions and guidelines for photo -documentation will be provided in the Photography 
Manual.  
11.3.5.  Skin Quality of Treatment Sites  
The POSAS (Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale) will be  used to assess the StrataGraft  
treated site(s) at visits designated in the Schedule of Study Events ( Section  6.8). The POSAS 
scale has 2 components : the observer assessment and the subject assessment. The observer 
assessment uses a 10 -point scale to assess vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, height, pliability, 
surface area , and overall opinion, while the subject component uses the same 10 -point scal e to 
assess pain, itching, stiffness, color, thickness , and overall opinion of StrataGraft treated sites. 
The investigator will complete the Observer POSAS assessment and a  parent/guardian will 
complete the subject assessment on behalf of subjects unable t o do so themselves . 
The PSAQ (Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire) was created specifically to assess linear 
scars and has not previously been used to assess burn scars. However, one of the 5 subscales 
within the tool is a subjective assessment of a subj ect’s satisfaction with their scar, an assessment 
that is not made in the POSAS. In its development, the PSAQ demonstrated internal consistency 
for each subscale, including the Satisfaction with Appearanc e subscale (Cronbach ɑ of 0.89 to 
0.94), as well as high test -retest reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient [ ICC] of 0.67  
to -0.83) of the same, demonstrating a high level of reliability in the use of the subscales 
independently. Only the 9 items of the Satisfaction with Appearance subscale will be  completed 
by the subject or a parent/guardian (on behalf of subjects unable to do so themselves) at each 
assessment per the Schedule of Study Events ( Section  6.8). 
11.3.6.  Other Wound Assessments  
The StrataGraft treatment site(s)  will also be assessed for clinical signs of infection, and the 
investigator will document the appearance of the wound using various descriptive terms.  At 
investigator discretion, treatment of infected/suspected infected wound sites may include the use 
of targeted wound cleansing agents, topical antimicrobial agents (excluding silver  and 
sulfa - -containing treatments  such as  mafenide acetate ) and/or systemic antibiotics. Wound -
related adverse events will be documented with photographs of the affected wound. See 
Section  11.9.1.5  for further details.  
11.4. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
The start and stop date s, dose, unit, frequency, route of administration , and indication for all 
prior and concomitant me dications, nondrug therapies (eg , blood transfusions, oxygen 
supplem entation, physical therapy, etc) and other procedures will be recorded in the eCRF.

Page 40 of 75 11.5. Safety Laboratory Tests  
Results of CMP and CBC  with differential , collected for clinical purposes , will be abstracted 
from the medical record.  If such results are not avail able, blood samples for research purposes 
will be collected only as part of a clinically necessary  venipuncture.  Clinical sample  analysi s for 
CMP and CBC  with differential  studies will be performed at the institution’s local laboratory.  
Investigators must review and sign laboratory reports and document the clinical significance of 
any laboratory abnormalities . New , clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or clinical ly 
significant changes in laboratory values will be reported as AEs.  
11.6. Immunological Assays  and Archival Samples  
Panel reactive antibodies  (PRA), anti-BSA antibody and archival samples will be obtained prior 
to StrataGraft application from all enrolled subje cts. Samples for the assessment of PRA and 
anti-BSA antibodies will also be obtained between Week 7 and Month 6 for all treated subjects.  
Specific instructions for collection, processing, storage, and shipment of these samples will be 
provided in the Labor atory Manual . 
11.7. Pain Assessment  
The EVENDOL pain assessment scale, a tool validated in preverbal children, will be used to 
assess pain in enrolled subjects  up to 5 years of age  (inclusive) . The EVENDOL scale is 
designed such that it can  be completed by an observer (eg,  parent) based upon outward 
behavioral manifestations such as crying, facial expressions, movements and posturing as well as 
environmental interactions  (Fournier -Charr ière, 2012 ).  
The FPRS (F ACES  pain rating scale ), a well -documented and validated tool, will be used to 
assess pain in enrolled subjects  older than 5  years of age.  The FPRS is demonstrated to 
effectively evaluate pain using a Likert -like scale of facial expressions, which  are converted into 
numeric values to obtain a quantitative assessment of pain  (Wong, 1998 ).  
Details regarding  administration of the pain assessment tools are provided in the Manual of 
Procedures.  
11.8. Assessment of the Need for Continued Hospitalization  
At each study visit subsequent to Day 1 but prior to hospital discharge, an assessment of the need 
for continued hospitalization will be completed.  Investigators will be asked to identify the 
reason(s) for continued hospitalization including: pain management, fluid  or nutritional  status, 
infection risk, ongoing infection, inability to perform activities of daily living, insufficient social 
support, or other issues .

Page 41 of 75 11.9. Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
11.9.1.  Definitions  
11.9.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward or undesirable medical occurrence in a subject who is administered a 
study treatment, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (inclu ding an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of study treatment.  
Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to pro gression of 
underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medica tion. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacologi cal action ” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the d efinition of an AE 
or SAE.  
Events that do not meet  the definition of an adverse events  include:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
Protocol V ersion  3, 26 Sep 2023  MNK15011001  
 
______________________________________________________________________________  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Page 42 of 75 • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated da y-to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Failure to achieve complete wound closure by Week 12.   
11.9.1.2.  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is an AE which exhibits a different nature or severity than those identified in 
the Investigator’s Brochure or has not previously been noted in relationship to StrataGraft.  
11.9.1.3.  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as those that are not present  at start of study treatment or 
that represent the exacerbation of a pre -existing condition during the treatment -emergent period. 
The treatment -emergent period is defined as the time from the application  of StrataGraft to the 
end of the study.   
11.9.1.4.  Serious Adv erse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
Death  
Death is an outcome of an event. The cause of death should be recorded and reported on 
the SAE Form. All causes of death must be repo rted as SAEs. The investigator should 
make every effort to obtain and send death certificates and autopsy reports to the Sponsor 
or designee, or state not available. See Section  4.4 for xenotransplantation considerations.  
Life-threatening  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening if, in the 
view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused dea th. For example, hepatitis that resolved 
without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening, even though 
hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting in 
angioedema of the face would not  be life -threatening, even though angioedema of the 
larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.  
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined as an admission to a hospital. The following si tuations should 
not be reported as SAEs:  
• A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a procedure 
required by the protocol.  
Protocol V ersion  3, 26 Sep 2023  MNK15011001  
 
______________________________________________________________________________  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Page 43 of 75 • A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of a routine 
procedure followed by the center (eg , stent removal after surgery). This should 
be recorded in the study file.  
• A hospitalization for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened.  
Persistent or significant incapacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) whic h may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
After enrollment and follow up in this study, any pregnancy reported to occur will be              
followed to conclu sion and all live -born children will be followed for 28 days following         
birth.  Any congenital anomaly or birth defect will be reported.  
Important Medical Events  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject or the subject may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical 
events inc lude allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
department or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Anticipated Adverse Events  
Adverse events (serious or nonserious) that commonly occur in the study population or 
background regimen will be considered anticipated events. Such events include known 
consequences of the condition under investigation (eg, symptoms, disease progression)  
and other events that may be common in this study population. A list of anticipated 
events for this study population is provided in the Investigators Brochure. Anticipated 
events are to be recorded in the eCRF and reported as SAEs when serious. These SAEs  
will not be expedited to health authorities, but rather, included in aggregate safety reports.  
11.9.1.5.  Adverse Event of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor ’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate. AESI will be reported 
using the SAE /AESI  Report Form and observe the same reporting timeline ( Table  6). For this 
study, Adverse Events of Special Interest  (AESI)  include:

hypo/hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and change in mental status) within 24 
hours after StrataGraft application  
• Unexpected or unusual infections   
• Derma tological malignancy  
If any of the above occ urs, the event will be reported within 24 hours of first knowledge of the 
event and follow -up reports provided as changes in the event occur.  Photographs will be taken of 
the affected wound(s) to document the AESI.  
11.9.2.  Adverse Event Medical Management Plan  
In the event of an AE, the investigator will use accepted standard of care (medication or surgery) 
as needed. A tiered approach will be used for the medical management of complications specific 
to the study burn sites, as described below:  
• Initial management of local infection or immune reactions with topical antimicrobials 
or anti -inflammatory agents, respectively.  
• Systemic antibiotics or anti -inflammatory medications administered for infections or 
immunological responses that fail to respond to topical thera py. 
• For complications that do not respond to topical or systemic therapy, the treated 
wound may be excised and the complication managed with topical or systemic 
therapy, as necessary.  
• Based on clinical judgment, autograft may be applied to the resulting wo und bed to 
expedite wound closure.  
11.10.  Relationship to Investigational Product   
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred , and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always assesses causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE 
data to the Sponsor.  
The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and 
send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
The following classifications should be used when evaluating the relationship of AEs or SAEs to 
study treatment.  
Table  4: Adverse Event Relationships  
Relationship  Definition  
Unrelated  No relationship between the AE and the administration of study treatment; the AE 
can be explained by other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject’s 
clinical state.

______________________________________________________________________________  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Page 45 of 75 Relationship  Definition  
Possibly related  A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of the 
study treatment, has a biologically causal  relationship with the study treatment, or 
for which an altern ative explanation for the AE is lacking. The reaction might have 
been produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject.  
Probably related  A reaction that follows a plausible  temporal sequence from administratio n of the 
study treatment  and has a biologically causal  relationship with the study treatment , 
and the influence of alternative factors  for the AE is unlikely .  
11.11.  Severity Assessment  
For purposes of consistency, if required the investigator may use the intensity grades presented 
in Table  5. 
Table  5: Adverse Event Intensity Grades  
Grade  Definition  
Mild  Does not interfere with subject ’s usual function and activities.  
Moderate  Interferes to some extent with subject ’s usual function and activities.  
Severe  Interferes significantly with subject ’s usual function and activities.  
To ensure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided:  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or 
severe myocardial infarction). The event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
importance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on the 
subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject ’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  
If an AE increases in severity (eg, from moderate to severe); decreases in severity (eg, changes 
from moderate to mild); or if there is a change in seriousness, a new AE will b e opened and the 
original AE will be closed. If an AE is still ongoing at the time of a subject’s completion of the 
last study follow -up visit, the resolution/stop date and time is left blank.  
11.12.  Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be r ecorded starting at the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) and 
will be followed by the investigator until the AE is resolved or stabilized. All study site follow -
up should be documented.  
Adverse events, AESIs, and SAEs will be reported from execut ion of the ICF through 
completion of study participation. The investigator is required to record the AE, regardless of the 
severity of the event or its relationship to study treatment.

Page 46 of 75 The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event ba sed on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
The investigator must follow all A Es until the event has resolved or stabilized or at such tim e, 
the investigator refers the subject to a non -study physician. The investigator will document 
further all of the follow -up information in the subject’s source documents.  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all A Es as presented in  Table  6.

It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records 
to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the SAE report form . 
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by the 
Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will 
be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to an agency.  
11.13.  Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female subject, or the female partner of a male subject, be comes pregnant during the study, 
the investigator will report to the Sponsor as soon as she/he becomes knowledgeable of the 
pregnancy. The subject will be followed for the duration of the pregnancy and the outcome (eg, 
spontaneous abortion, live birth, sti ll birth, congenital anomalies, birth defects) will be reported 
to the Sponsor as soon as it is known. If the pregnancy results in a live birth, a postdelivery 
follow -up will be performed at least 28 days after the baby is born and must be reported to the 
Sponsor’s pharmacovigilance personnel, or designee, within 24  hours of the study site becoming 
aware of the follow -up information.  
Information including the definition of  Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) , 
Contraceptive Guidance , and Collection of Pregnancy Information  can be found in  Appendix 3 .

Page 47 of 75 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1. Sample Size Determination  
Approximately  50 subjects will be enrolled  into one of two age cohorts:  up to 40 subjects in  2 to 
< 12 years  cohort or up to 10 subjects in 12 to < 17 years .  
An overall  sample  size of 50 subj ects will provide  greater than 90% power to d etermine that at 
least 50%  of the subjects achieve confirmed complete closure of all StrataGraft treatment sites on 
or before Week 12 without autograft placement, assuming  that the actual proportion of  subjects 
with confirmed complete  closure of all  StrataGraft treatment sit es without autografting will be > 
83%. This assumption is based upon the results of a study in adults for the same indication 
(Holmes, 2020 ).   
Similar power i s provided with the 40 -subject sample of the 2 to < 12 years  cohort, which is 
considered to be the more common  group to be  enrolled .  In the event that th e 40 subjects have 
been enrolled into the 2 to < 12 years cohort  but the enrollment into the older 12 to < 17 years 
cohort  is not yet complete, the Sponsor reserves the right to close the study  at their discretion.  
12.2. Analysis Populations  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) and Safety population s will include all enrolled subjects who received 
StrataGraft . 
12.3. Statistical Analyses  
This section provides a general summary of the statistical methods to be used in analyzing study 
data. A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be provided in a separate document that 
will be finalized prior to  database lock . SAS version 9.4 or newer will b e used.  
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include the mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum value, and maximum value. Categorical data will be summarized by count s and 
percentages.  
12.3.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
12.3.1.1.  Primary Endpoint  
The pediatric study plans to enroll up to 50 subjects into two age cohorts:  2 to ≤ 12 years and 
12 to ≤ 17 years.  Endpoints will be assessed using the entire  ITT population . 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study the percentage of subjects achieving conf irmed 
complete closure of  all StrataGraft treatment sites on or before Week 12 without autograft 
placement. For subjects with more than one treatment site , all treatment sites must be confirmed 
closed before the subject can be declared to be confirmed closed. Confirmed complete wound 
closure is defined as complete skin re -epithelialization confirmed at 2 consecutive visits at least 2 
weeks apart but no late r than Week 20 . Complete confirmed wound closure will be considered to 
have occurred at the earlier of the two observations of complete skin re -epithelialization without 
drainage.

Confidential and Proprietary  
Page 48 of 75 For the primary efficacy endpoint, number (%) and 95% Confidence Interval ( CI) derived from 
the normal approximation to the  binomi al will be summarized based on the ITT population. 
Subjects with missing data will be imputed as non-responders.  The statistical significance for th e 
primary endpoint is declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI of the endpoint is ≥ 50%.  
The analysis will also be performed based on all observed data, i.e, excluding any missing data.  
The analyses by age cohort will be presented.  
The Objective, Population , Hypothesis, Endpoi nt, and Intercurrent Events and Data Handling for 
the Primary Endpoint are described in  Table  7. 
12.3.1.2.  Ranked Secondary Endpoints  
After the primary endpoint is successfully reached, the ranked secondary efficacy endpoints will 
each be tested with a 2 -sided confidence interval with 0.05 Type I error in a hierarchical manner 
in the rank order as in  Table  8. The ranked secondary endpoints are:  
1. Mean of averaged percent area of StrataGraft treatment site closed per subject at 
Week  12 without autograft pl acement  
2. Number (%)  of confirmed complete wound closu res of the StrataGraft treatment sites 
on or before Week 12 without autograft placement  
3. Mean of averaged percent area of StrataGraft treatment site autografted by Week 12  
For continuous efficacy endpoints, missing data will not be imputed. Missing or incomplete 
binary variables will be imputed as failures. Missing data are anticipated to occur only if the 
subject is lost to follow -up because information can be obtained for a missing visit when the 
subject returns for a subsequent visit. If a subject has autograft placement, the data collected after 
the autograft placement will be censored.  
The averaged percent area closed per subject at Week 12 will be calculated as (Sum of  percent 
area closed across treatment sites for a subject at Week 12/the total number of treatment sites on 
a subject) . 
The percentage of StrataGraft treatment sites with confirmed complete wound closure on or 
before Week 12 will be calculated as [(Total n umber of StrataGraft treatment sites with 
confirmed complete wound closure without autografting on or before Week 12/Total number of 
treatment sites) x 100].   
The averaged percent area of StrataGraft treatment sites per subject autografted by Week 12 will  
be calculated as (Sum of percent area of StrataGraft treatment sites per subject autografted by 
Week 12/the number of treatment sites on that subject ). It is a cumul ative sum of  percent area 
autografted for all nonmissing  visits on or  before Week 12 .  
The summary statistics with 95% confidence interval (CI) and p -value based on null hypothesis 
specified in  Table  8 for each endpoint from t -distribution will be presented based on the ITT 
population by designated treatment site and pooled designated treatment site.  The analyses by 
age cohort will be prese nted.

Page 49 of 75 12.3.1.3.  Binary Endpoints  
For binary endpoints, number (%) of subjects and its 95% CI derived from  the normal 
approximation to the  binomi al will be summarized based on ITT  by designated treatment site and 
pooled designated treatment site.  The denominator for a treatment site is determined by numbers 
of subjects with the designated site. The number and percent of missing data will be shown.  
The missing data of binary endpoints will not be imputed  for exploratory endpoints .  
12.3.1.4.  Exploratory Endpo ints 
For continuous and binary exploratory endpoints, the analyses will be the same as ones in 
Section  12.3.1.2  and Section  12.3.1.3 . For the time -to-event efficacy endpoint, the Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be presented based on the ITT population. Subjects not having any event during the 
study will hav e their time censored at the last available date in the study. The Kaplan -Meier 
estimates and 95% CIs for the 25th percentile, 50th percentile and 75th percentile will be 
presented.  
For each exploratory continuous  endpoint, the summary statistics with 95% confidence interval 
(CI) will be presented based on the ITT population  by designated treatment site and pooled 
designated treatment site.  
The exploratory endpoints for this study are:  
• Mean percent area of StrataGra ft treatment site closed without autograft placement at 
Week  8 
• Mean Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) observer total score at 
Week 12, and Months 6 and 12.  
• Changes in skin quality outcome (POSAS and Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire 
[PSAQ] scores) across time.  
• Incidence and severity of pain at the treatment site using EVENDOL (EValuation 
ENfant DOuLeur, ie, Evaluation of Child Pain; observer or parent) or FPRS (Wong -
Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale with 6 faces with expressions denoting de grees of 
pain; subject) over time.  
• Percent of subjects with complete closure of StrataGraft treatment site without 
autografting at Weeks 6 and 8 and Months 6 and 12.  
• Time to complete closure following application of StrataGraft.  
• Mean percent wound closur e over time from Day 21 through Month 12.  
• Percent of subjects achieving and maintaining persistent wound closure at Months 6 
and 12.  
• Mean scar satisfaction based on PSAQ scores at Week 12 and Months 6 and 12.

Subjects wi ll be encouraged to return to clinic for each scheduled visit.  Direct observation of the 
wound and collection of data at scheduled times is essential to ensure the quality of the data.  
However, should a visit be missed , thereby resulting in missing  data fo r that visit , the following 
approaches will be employed to manage the missing data.

CONSIDERATIONS  
The study will be conducted in full compliance with applicable international, national , and local 
regulatory requirements , including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations , 21 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 56, 314.106 and 312.120 (where applicable), 
International Council  on Harmonization ( ICH) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) in 
accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki, and 
European regulation 536/2014/EU (where applicable).  
13.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain the approval of the IRB/ independent ethics 
committee (IEC) before the start of the study. A copy of the approval letter along with a roster of 
IRB/IEC members and compliance letter or their US Departmen t of Health and Human Services 
general assurance number will be provided to the Sponsor and retained as part of the study 
records. During the course of the study, the investigator will provide timely and accurate reports 
to the IRB/IEC on the progress of t he study at appropriate intervals and at the completion of the 
study. The investigator  will notify the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings per 
IRB/IEC guidelines. The study protocol, ICF, advertisements (if any), subjec t-facing materials, 
and amendments (if any) will be approved by the IRB/IEC in conformance with international, 
national , and local regulatory requirements.  
An investigator may not make any changes in the conduct of the study without IRB/IEC and 
Sponsor approval except when ne cessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the 
subjects. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects may 
be implemented immediately ; however,  the change must then be documented, reported to the 
IRB/IEC and Spons or within 5 working days, who will then submit the deviation to the 
appropriate regulatory agency in the required time frame, if appropriate.  
13.2. Financial Disclosure  
Investigators and sub -investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate finan cial 
information , as requested by the Sponsor , in order to submit complete and accurate financial 
certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are 
responsible for providing updated information on financial  interests periodically , as appropriate.   
13.3. Subject Information and Consent  
The ICF to be submitted to the IRB /IEC  must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor prior to 
IRB/IEC  submission.  Once approved, only the IRB/IEC -reviewed and -approved consent form 
may be used to consent subjects.  The investigator will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the 
IRB/IEC’s written approval as well as the IRB/IEC -approved ICF prior to the start of the study.  
At Screening, and at any other time as may be required by the  study, subjects/parents/guardians 
will be presented with the IRB/IEC -approved consent forms and any privacy authorization as 
required by local and national regulations (such as the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act [HIPAA] authorization form).  Subjects/parents/guardians will be given a 
description of the stud y providing content as per the essential elements of informed consent,

Page 55 of 75 allowed time to ask questions, asked to read the consent form(s) and then provided an 
opportunity to discuss the  contents of these forms with study site personnel.  
As the subjects in this study are all minors  at study enrollment , parents/guardians will be asked 
to sign these forms in compliance with ICH GCP and all applicable national and international 
regulations,  before participating in any study -related procedures. Subjects and/or parent/guardian 
will be made aware that they may withdraw from the study at any time. Subjects unable to give 
written informed consent must orally assent to the procedures when having r eached the 
appropriate age per local policies and written informed consent must be obtained in accordance 
with national and local laws, as applicable.  Subjects who reach the age of majority (usually 
18 years of age) during their participation in the study will be re -consented.  
The ICF must contain all applicable elements of informed consent and the mandatory statements 
as defined by national and local regulations, including confidentiality.  All versions of each 
subject's signed ICF (originals) will be maint ained by the site.  Copies of the signed copies of the 
consent form(s) and the HIPAA authorization form, if applicable, will be given to the 
subject/parents/guardians.  
If a subject withdraws consent and/or HIPAA authorization, the investigator may no longe r 
disclose health information, unless it is needed to preserve the scientific integrity of the study.  
13.4. Master Identification List  
At the time of consent, each subject will be assigned a unique study identification number.  The 
investigator or designee is res ponsible for maintaining a list of each subject’s name, medical 
record number and assigned study identification  number.  The investigator must follow all 
applicable privacy laws in order to protect a subject’s privacy and confidentiality.  Information 
that c ould identify a subject will be blinded on any material received by the Sponsor.  
13.5. Data Protection  
Study subjects will be assigned a unique study identifier.  All subject records or datasets that are 
transferred to the Sponsor will be identified by this uniqu e study identifier only.  Study site 
personnel are responsible for purging subject names and medical record number from any 
records shared with the Sponsor.  
Within the ICF, the subject/parents/guardians will be informed that his/her personal study -related 
data will be used by the Sponsor in accordance with local data protection laws.  In addition, 
subject/parents/guardians will be informed that medical records may be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by t he Sponsor, by IRB/IEC 
members, and/or by inspectors/auditors from regulatory authorities.  
13.6. Committees Structure  
An independent DMC  will be convened in order to ensure that the safety of subject s is 
adequately protected. The DMC  objectives, composition, and  operational details of its activitie s 
will be defined in the DMC Charter.

If an investigator  retires, relocates, or otherwise withdraws from conducting the study, the 
investigator  must notify the Sponsor to agree upon an acceptable storage solution. Regulatory 
agencies will be notified with the appropriate documentation.  
Any changes in investigator (s) or sub -investigator(s) will be promptly disclosed to the Sponsor 
and will require an updated Statement of Investigator (ie,  FDA form 1572) . As such, the 
investigator  must promptly disclose these changes to the Sponsor or their designee.  
The investigator  must notify their IRB/IEC of protocol deviations in accordance with local 
regulatory and IRB/IEC requirements.  
The eCRF data are stored in a database and processed electronically. The Sponsor’s medical 
monitor  will review  the data for safety information. The data are also reviewed for completeness 
and logical consistency. Automated validation programs will identify  missing data, out -of-range 
data, and other data inconsistencies. In addition, clinical laboratory data will be processed 
electronically. Requests for data clarification will be forwarded to the study site for resolution 
and responded to in a timely fashio n, usually within 5 business days.  
13.9. Source Documents  
All subject information recorded in the eCRF will be attributable to source data from the 
investigational site.  
The investigator shall retain and preserve 1 copy of all data collected or databases generat ed in 
the course of the study, specifically including but not limited to those defined by GCP as 
essential. Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application or supplement in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications or supplements in an ICH region or at least 2 years have 
elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational medicinal 
product. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the 
applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. It is the responsibility 
of the Sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need

Page 57 of 75 to be  retained. Prior to destruction of any study essential documents, the investigator must first 
obtain written approval from the Sponsor.  
13.10.  Study and Site Closure  
The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any reason. 
If the investigator suspends or terminates the study, the investigator will promptly inform the 
Sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide them with a detailed written explanation. Upon study 
completion, the investigator will provide the Sponsor, IRB/IEC, and reg ulatory agency with final 
documents, reports , and summaries as required by regulations. Study termination and follow -up 
will be performed in compliance with the Sponsor ’s or designee ’s standard operating procedures.  
The Sponsor, investigator, or local and  national regulatory authorities may discover conditions 
during the study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated. This action may 
be taken after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and investigator. Conditions that 
may war rant termination of the study/study site include, but are not limited to:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled 
in the study.  
• The decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing or 
evaluation of the investigational product . 
• Failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate.  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent regulations.  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the study site to the Sponsor, study 
monitor, or local and national regulatory authorities.  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

Page 61 of 75 APPENDIX 2.   STUDY GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS  
Ethical Considerations  
As the pediatric population is considered a highly vulnerable group of patients, based on age and 
inability to give full in formed consent, it is important to address the ethics of clinical research in 
this group. Although the FDA has mandated that a pediatric program be initiated when a 
treatment is relevant to this population, nonetheless, some argue it is totally unethical for 
children to participate in clinical studies and become the human equivalent of a test animal 
(Ward, 2018 ), which prompts this discussion for the study of StrataGraft.  
There are several questions that should be addressed to justify this clinical study. These 
questions are: 1) is this disease only found in pediatric patients? 2) are alter nate treatment s 
available that are just as effective? a nd 3) will the study result in value to the subject or to the 
population of subjects that may receive the treatment?  
To address the first question, although burns of the nature to be recruited in this study, are seen 
across the age spectrum, the healing response may differ depending upon the recuperative 
abilities, which do not change with age. As such, the issue of burn  treatment in this age group is 
unique. Second, there are alternate treatments that may be considered to be just as effective.  
However, there are collateral concerns about autografting that make the StrataGraft approach 
particularly attractive in this pop ulation. Should StrataGraft decrease or eliminate the need for 
autografting in pediatric children with DPT burns as it has been demonstrated to do in adults, 
then use of StrataGraft may be beneficial  to these patients . Moreover, the ease of use of 
StrataGr aft will be very helpful to hospitals and medical centers in isolated areas of the United 
State s where dedicated burn units are geographically distant.  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and the following:  
• Consensus ethical princi ples derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines  
• Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines  
• Applicable laws and regulations  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, Investigator Brochure, and other relevant 
documents ( eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB/IEC by the investigator 
and reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC before the study is initiated.  
• Any am endments to the protocol will require IRB/IEC approval before 
implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants.  
• The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC annually or 
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by the IRB/IEC  
Protocol V ersion  3, 26 Sep 2023  MNK15011001  
 
______________________________________________________________________________  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Page 62 of 75 − Notifying the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings as  required by 
IRB/IEC procedures  
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB/IEC, European regulation 
536/2014 for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable lo cal 
regulations  
Financial Disclosure  
Investigators and sub -investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial 
certification or disclosure statem ents to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are 
responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 
1 year after completion of the study.  
Informed Consent Process  
• The investigator or his/her  representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
participant (who is capable of providing assent) and his/her legally authorized 
representative and answer all questions regarding the study. Participants and their 
legally authorized representativ e must be informed that their participation is 
voluntary . The statement of informed consent (ICF)  that meets the requirements of 21 
CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where a pplicable, and the IRB/IEC or 
study center must be signed by the subject’s legally authorized representative as all 
subjects will be minors  at the time of enrollment. Subjects who reach the age of 
majority (usually 18  years of age) during their participati on in the study will be re -
consented.  
• The medical record of each study subject must include a statement that written 
informed consent was obtained before the participant was enrolled in the study and 
the date the written consent was obtained. The authorize d person obtaining the 
informed consent must also sign the ICF.  
• Participants must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during 
their participation in the study.  
• A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant and the participa nt’s legally 
authorized representative.  
Data Protection  
• Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any participant 
records or datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; 
participant names or any in formation which would make the participant identifiable 
will not be transferred.  
• The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used 
by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure 
must also be explained to the participant.

Page 63 of 75 • The participant must be informed that hi s/her medical records may be examined by 
Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the 
sponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory 
authorities.  
Committees Structure  
An independent DMC will be convened in order to ensure that the safety of subjects is 
adequately protected. The DMC objectives, composition, and operational details of its activities 
will be defined in the D MC Charter.  
Publication Policy  
• The results of thi s study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this 
is foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the 
sponsor before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information 
and to provide co mments.  
• The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as ind ividual 
site data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual 
agreement.  
• Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  
Data Quality  Assurance  
• All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF 
unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The 
investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accu rate and correct by 
physically or electronically signing the CRF.  
• The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports 
the information entered in the CRF.  
• The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC  review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study 
including quality checking of the data.  
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source  data verification to confirm that data 
entered into the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and 
verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being 
protected; and that the study is being conducted in  accordance with the currently 
approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
• All records, source documents, study worksheets, signed ICFs, and any other 
documents pertaining to the conduct of this s tudy must be retained by the investigator

(US 21CFR§312.62). No records may be destroyed during the retention period 
without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another 
location or party without written notification to the sponsor.  
Source Documents  
• Source documents provide evidence for the existence  of the participant and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the 
investigator’s site.  
• Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source 
documents must be consistent with the source d ocuments or the discrepancies must be 
explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer 
records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  
Study and Site Closure  
The sponsor designee reserve s the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies 
have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are 
not limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guid elines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator  
• Discontinuation of further study treatment development

PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile.  
Non-WOCBP Status  
• Premenarchal  
• Permanently sterile female is a post-menarchal, pre-menopausal female with 1 of the 
following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Docume nted bilateral salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation may come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• A post -menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post -
menopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy  (HRT). Note that in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
Pregnancy Testing  
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate in this study. All women 
of childbearing potential will be t ested for pregnancy  during Screening  and if found to be 
pregnant, will be excluded from participation.  
Contraception  
Acceptable forms of contraception include hormonal measures (oral contraceptive pills, 
contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, injections), intrauterine devices, double barrier method 
(condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus spermicidal gel or foam), and abstinence.  
Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Female Participants Who Become Pregnant     
• The investigator will collec t pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on 
the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a 
participant's pregnancy. The partic ipant will be followed to determine the outcome of 
the pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant 
and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, 
follow -up will not be required for lon ger than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated

Page 66 of 75 delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal 
status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or 
SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported 
as such. Any post -study, pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably rela ted to the 
study treatment by the investigator will be reported to the sponsor. While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study 
participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
continue with all scheduled study evaluations. Pregnant subjects will be followed 
until post -partum and the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported.

Section  4.4  The US FDA considers  StrataGraft to be  is a xenotransplantation product because  of an historic 
exposure of the epidermal cells to well characterized mouse cells.  Mouse cells are no longer used in 
the manufacture  in the past, one of the cell types used to make StrataGraft was grown with 
mouse cells. The cell banks have been thoroughly  tested and found to be free of detectable  
adventitious  infectious agents , and there have been no reported zoonotic infection in clinical trial s. 
and mouse cells are no longer used in the manufacture of StrataGraft. There have been no 
identified health concerns associated with these mouse cells .  However, the is a very low 
possibility that zoonotic infection could occur.  It is important that patients/p arents/legal guardians be 
made aware that people who receive treatment with StrataGraft should  not donate blood, blood 
components, plasma, leukocytes, tissues, breast milk, ova, sperm or body parts for transplantation . 
 
Recipients of xenotransplantation pr oducts are generally not eligible , per federal regulations,  to 
donate whole blood, blood components, source plasma or source leukocytes.  However, 
individual blood banks may request an exception  from FDA .  StrataGraft recipients wishing to 
donate blood or blood products should check with their donation center.  StrataGraft recipients 
who otherwise meet the donor requirements are eligible to donate human cells, tissues, breast 
milk, ova, sperm , or body parts for transplantation.  
 
A small amount of blood (3mL), called an archival sample, will be collected before StrataGraft 
application.  This sample could be used as a baseline to assess health issues that may be related to 
treatment.  These samples will be used only for the purpose of responding to a request from the FDA.  
Both archival samples and any associated patient  subject  information will be stored and used only as 
required and allowed by law.  Finally, although not required, in the event of a recipient’s death, an 
autopsy should be considered.

Section  6.1  Subjects will undergo baseline assessments including a targeted physical examination and collection 
of clinical laboratory assessments during Screening. After enrollment and StrataGraft appl ication, 
wound assessments, photographs, and solicitation of AEs will be performed at each study visit  via 
telephone or video interaction if the subject is unable to attend the visit. However, wound closure 
may only be assessed at face-to-face visits.  If not collected during Screening, clinical laboratory 
samples will be collected via venipuncture performed prior to StrataGraft application on Day 1. 
Immunological samples (monitoring of PRA and anti -BSA antibodies) will be collected prior to 
StrataGraft appl ication, and again between Week  76 and Month 6 for all treated subjects.  Wound closure may not be assessed 
via telephone or video interaction.

Section  9.3  StrataGraft will be shipped to the study site on dry ice. Upon arrival at the site, the StrataGraft may be 
maintained in the sealed  shipping con tainer  until the date and time  indicated on this container . 
If StrataGraft will not be used until after the date and time indicated on the shipping container , 
upon arrival at the site, StrataGraft should  be transferred from the shipping container to a secure, 
ultra-cold (-70°C to -90°C) freezer with monitored temperature. Details regarding shipment and 
storage requirements can may be found in the Manual of Procedures. Once StrataGraft has been 
transferred  into a site’s ultra -cold freezer  received at the site , any excursion from required storage 
range ( -70°C to -90°C) must be reported to the Sponsor as soon as the temperature fluctuation 
becomes known and prior to clinical use .

Section  11 All study assessments and times are listed in the Schedule of Study Events (Section 6.8). General 
instructions for the administration of these assessments are provided in the following subsec tions. 
Additional (Unscheduled) safety assessments may be performed as needed. Specific instructions and 
questionnaires/forms (Where appropriate) will be provided in a study manual. All assessments will 
be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) . 
 
It is expected the subjects will attend all scheduled study visits. Should a subject be unable to 
participate in an in -person visit, wound assessments and solicitation of AEs may be performed 
by telemedicine/video interactions. However, no assessment of  wound re -epithelialization nor 
observation or confirmation of closure may be performed via video/telemedicine visits. These 
wound assessments may be performed only during a face -to-face visit.

Section  11.9.1.5  An adverse event of special interest (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and medical concern 
specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid comm unication 
by the Investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate. AESI will be reported using the SAE/AESI 
Report Form and observe the same reporting timeline (Table 6). For this study, Adverse Events of 
Special Interest (AESI) include:  
• Signs/symptoms of en dotoxin reaction (ie, combination of hypo/hyperpyrexia, 
hypo/hypertension tachycardia, tachypnea and change in mental status) within 24 hours 
after StrataGraft application  
• Unexpected or unusual infections  
• Dermatological malignancy  
• Other transplantation rel ated adverse events or clinical events that are suspicious of a 
xenogeneic cause, e.g. disease/disorder of known zoonotic origins  Reflects modifications of the 
xenotransplantation product 
requirements for StrataGraft as 
granted by the US FDA.

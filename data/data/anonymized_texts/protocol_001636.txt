contraceptive hormones ( i.e., using a stable dose for ≥ 90 days), an intrauterine device, 
barrier methods ( e.g., diaphragm, condoms, spermicid es) to prevent pregnancy, 
practicing abstinence or where the partner is sterile ( e.g., vasectomy), should be 
considered to be of childbearing pot
ential. 
 
All WOCBP must use an active method of birth control during the course of the study , 
in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Abstinence or having a sterile partner 
is not an active method of birth contr
ol. 
 
Changed paragraphs 1 and 2: 
WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not 
undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or 
bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as ≥12 months with no 
menses without an alternative medical cause). Women who are usin g an active method 
of birth 
control, are practicing abstinence, or where the partner is sterile ( e.g., 
vasectomy), should be considered t
o be WOCBP.

Title: 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Within Subject Comparison Study of 
the Safety, Tolerability and Effectiveness of A-101 Topical Solution in Subjects with 
Seborrheic Keratosis. 
 
Objectives: 
The main objective 
of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of A-101  
(hydrogen peroxide) Solution 25%, 32.5% and 40% when applied to individual 
seborrheic keratosis (
SK) target lesions on the back compared with a matching A-101 
Solution Vehicle. 
 
Methodology/Study Design: 
The duration of s
tudy participation is anticipated to be a maximum of 95 days per 
subject. This inclu
des the up to 14-day screening period, a visit for a required study 
medication application, a 21-day no treatment period, a visit for an optional study 
medication retreatment appl
ication, a 56-day no treatment follow-up period and a 
maximum allowable 4-day Visit 9 visit 
window. Study visits are: 
 Visit 1  (Day -13 to 0) enrollment; start screening period 
 Visit 2 (Day 1) randomization; study medication application 
 Visit 3  (Day 8) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 4 (Day 15) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 5  (Day 22 ) follow-up visit where target lesions that meets the retreatment 
criteria will receive a second study medic
ation application 
 Visit 6  (Day 29) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 7  (Day 43) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 8 (Day 57) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 9  (Day 78 ) no treatment follow-up; end of study.  
 
During Visit 1 the investig
ator will, for each subject, identify 4 individual SK lesions 
(target lesions) on the back for treatment, perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
collec t blood samples for 
clinical laboratory safety tests to determine the subject’s 
eligibility for randomizat
ion. Subjects may have more than 4 SK lesions on the back, or 
on other body surfaces, but o
nly the target lesions on the back will be evaluated and 
treated.  
 
During Visit
 2, eligible subject ’s target lesions will be rando mized, each to receive 1 
study medication (a unique study medic
ation for each target lesion) and then the study 
medication applications will be perfor
med. Every eligible subject will receive all 4 of the 
study medications. 
 
At Visits 3 and
 4, subjects will be seen for a no treatment follow-up.

At Visit 5, subjects will be seen for follow-up and any target lesion that meets the re-
treatment criteria 
(i.e., Physician’s Lesion Assessment [PLA] >0 ) will receive a second 
study medication application.  
 
At
 Visits 6-8, subjects w
ill be seen for a no treatment follow- up. 
 
At Visit 9, subjects will be seen for a no treatment follow-up and discharged from the 
study. 
 
Number of Subjects
: 
Appr
oximately 36 subjects will be enrolled in this study at one United States 
investigational center with the go
al to have 32 subjects complete the study. 
 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: 
Subjects will be adult males and females with 4 clinically typical appearing seborrheic 
keratosis target les
ions on the back. 
 
Study Medications, Application, and Mode of Adminis
tration: 
There are 4 study medications for topical application: 
 A-101 Solution 25% 
 A-101 Solution 32.5% 
 A-101 Solution 40% 
 A-101 Solution Vehicle.  
 
Study medications will be randoml
y assigned to the 4 target lesions on each subject’s 
back; each subject will 
have all the 4 study medications applied, 1 study medication to 
each individual target lesion.
  
 
There are 16 treatment grou
ps.  Each treatment group consists of one of 8 randomly-
selected permutations for applying each study medication to one of the four target 
lesions per subject.  
 
At Visit 2, eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment groups 
(determining the study medication that wi
ll be appli ed to each individual target lesion) 
in a blinded manner. After randomization an investigational center staff member other 
than the investigator, w
ill perform, the study medication applications. 
 
At Visit 5, any lesion that meets the 
retreatment criteria ( i.e., PLA >0) will receive a 
second study medication application.

The planned treatment and study duration are: 
 Enrollment period: approximately 35 days 
 Subject participation period: up to 95 days 
 Study duration (first subject first visit through last subject last visit): 
approximately 130 days.   
 
Evaluations – Effectiveness: 
The investigator will evaluate the average overall severity of each SK target lesion using 
the Physician’s Lesion Assessment (PLA) and the subject will evaluate each target lesion 
using the Subject’s Self -Assessment (SSA). The investigator will measure Lesion 
Dimensions ( i.e., surface area and thickness) throughout the study for each target lesion. 
 
Evaluations – Safety: 
Local Skin Reactions (LSR) for each target lesion, clinical laboratory safety tests, ECGs, 
vital sign readings, concomitant therapies, urine pregnancy tests and adverse events 
(AEs) will be monitored throu
ghout the study. 
 
Evaluations – Other: 
The investigator will evaluate Signs of Seborrheic Keratosis (SSK) throughout the study 
and take standardized color photographs to document the status of the target lesions 
throughout the study. 
 
Statistical Methods: 
The primary effectiveness analyses will be comparisons between Vehicle and each 
active treatment, based on mean change from the Visit 2 PLA, using a repeated-
measures Analysis of Covarian
ce model suitable for the study design. For this purpose, 
the primary analysis visit will be Visit 9. Secondary effectiveness analyses will include a 
similar analysis of SSA and
 other effectiveness evaluations suitable for analysis as 
continuous variables. In addition, secondary analyses will be performed on proportion 
of PLA and SSA responders, where a s
ubject will be considered a responder if the Visit 
9 score is 0.  A similar responder analysis will be done at Visit 5. Chi-square will be used 
to analyze difference in response r
ates.

2.1. Summary 
Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is one of the most common skin tumors in man. These benign 
epithelial skin tumors are most commonly seen in older individuals, increasing in 
prevalence with increasing age, and affect men and women roughly equally. While the 
growths may be solitary, they often occur in large numbers and typically present as 
well demarcated, elevated or “stuck-on” appearing papules or plaques that may vary 
from flesh-colored, to shades of yellow, gray, brown, or black.  
 
Though benign, they are often 
cosmetically worrisome to patients, must sometimes be 
distinguished from other benign or malignant skin tumors and may become pruritic, 
irritated, bleed, and may be painful when traumatized particularly when located in 
areas prone to friction and trauma such as belt-lines and brassiere-strap lines.  
 
Patients may seek treatment
 of SK for cosmetic reasons, especially if they are large , 
pigmented, and/or if multiple 
lesions are present, or simply because the lesions are 
commonly associated with “old age” . Removal may be medically indicated, however, 
for lesions that become irritated, pruritic, inflamed, or painful, o r for lesions that the 
clinician feels require histologic confirmation of the diagnosis. 
  
Numerous treatment options exist, and include a plethora of destructive/ablative 
modalities such as liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, lasers of variou s 
wavelengths (ablative and non-ablative), radio-frequency ablation, and surgical 
removal by curettage or surgical excision. There is, however, a notable lack of well- 
controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy, complications and complication rates of 
these treatments. There is great variability among practitioners in the methods 
employed using each of these techniques ( e.g., variability in contact time and method of 
freezing the lesions with liquid nitrogen) with great variability of the results. None of 
these treatments is, in 
fact, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
the treatment of seborrheic keratosis. While these methods can achieve cure rates, many 
require specialized training and the use of expensive equipment, they are painful and 
may require anesthesia and/or analgesia, and they are often complicated by significant 
adverse cosmetic outcomes. Both hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, which 
may be transient, but are often permanent, are common, as is scarring at the treatment 
site, and the typical po
st-surgical risks of bleeding and infection increase the risk that 
the result of the treatment of these lesions may be worse than the disease itself.

the simplest peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable 
household goods including chlorine-free bleaches, general-purpose cleaning products, 
and disinfectants, has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has 
been used in oral hygiene products and tooth-whitening systems for many years. In 
industry, it is employed in the treatment of wastewater and in high concentrations; it is 
used in bleaching vegetables, paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to its use 
as an oral topical agent noted above, H 2O2 is widely employed at low concentrations 
(e.g., 3% -6%) as a wound irrigant and topical antiseptic/disinfectant, and has been in 
use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by Richardson in 1858.  
 
H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects 
of reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by the presence of a complex 
antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, glutathione 
peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, lipid peroxidase 
and others, as well as non-enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and 
uric acid, tocophero
l, glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other water soluble 
groups.   The local application of supra-physiologic concentrations of H 2O2 may 
overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, allowing H 2O2 to act not only 
through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of reactive oxygen species, 
and local lipid peroxidation, but also by the generation of local concentrations of O 2 that 
are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells. 
 
Data from a preliminary 
clinical trial suggest ed that the topical application of H 2O2 35% 
solution to SK lesions has the potential to safely and effectively resolve the SK lesions 
without the need for analgesia and/or anesthesia, and with a minimal risk of transient 
or permanent hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, or scarring. 
 
2.2. Study Rationale 
Preliminary clinical information, as discussed above, suggests that H 2O2 35% solution 
applied topically may resolve SK lesions. This study is designed to provide initial 
safety, tolerability and effectiveness data for A-101 (H 2O2) Solution when applied to 
target lesions of SK.  
 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of A-101 Solution 25%, 
32.5% and 40% when applied to SK target lesions on the back compared with a 
matching A-101 Solution Vehicle. Secondary objectives include evaluat ing the safety 
and toler
ability of A-101 Solution when applied topically in subjects with SK.

This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, within subject comparison study 
of A-101 Solution 25%, 32.5% and 40% and the A-101 Solution Vehicle to investigate the 
safety, tolerabili
ty and
 effectiveness in subjects with SK. Eligible subjects will have 4 
appropriate SK target lesion
s on the back.  
 
The duration of study participation is
 anticipated to be a maximum of 95 days per 
subject. This inclu
des the up to 14-day screening period, a visit for a required study 
medication application, a 21-day no treatment period, a visit for an optional study 
medication retreatment applic
ation, a 56-day no treatment follow-up period and a 
maximum allowable 4-day Visit 9 visit 
window. Study visits are: 
 Visit 1 (Day -13 to 0) enrollment; screening period 
 Visit 2 (Day 1) randomization; study medication application 
 Visit 3 (Day 8) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 4 (Day 15) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 5  (Day 22 ) follow-up visit where any target lesion that meets the 
retreatment criteria will receive a second study medication application 
 Visit 6 (Day 29) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 7 (Day 43) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 8 (Day 57) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 9  (Day 78) no treatment follow-up; end of study.  
 
During Visit 1 the investig
ator will, for each subject, identify 4 seborrheic keratosis 
lesions (target lesions) on the back for treatment, perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) 
and co llect blood samples for clinical laboratory safety tests to determine the subject’s 
eligibility for randomization. Subjects may have more than 4 lesions on the back, or on 
other body surfaces, but only the target lesions on the back will be evaluated and 
treated.  
 
During Visit 2, eligible subjects will be randomized to study medication (a unique study 
medication for each target lesion) and t
hen the study medication applications will be 
performed.  
 
At Visits 3 and 4, subjects will be seen for a no treatment follow-up. 
 
At Visit 5, subj
ects will be seen for follow-up and any lesion that meets the re-treatment 
criteria (Section 5.7.6 ) will receive
 a second application of the assigned study 
medication.  
 
At Visits 6-8, subjects will be seen for a no treatment follow-up.

The study medications will be packaged in identical appearing, single-use, 2-dram 
(~7.4 mL) amber glass, scr
ew-top vials that each contains approximately 3 mL of study 
medication. 
 
One Subject Kit
 that contains 3 vials of each of the 4 study medications (12 vials total) 
will be provid ed to the investigational center for each subject. Subject Kits will be 
labeled with a two-part, three-panel, double-blind label. One part (one-panel) of the 
label remains attached to 
the Subject Kit, the other part (two-panel tear-off) is separated 
and attach ed to the subject’s  Label Page CRF when the study medication is first 
dispensed for a subject. 
 
The affixed part and the first panel of the tear-off part of the Subject Kit label show at 
least the following: 
 Subject Kit number (randomization number) 
 Protocol number 
 Storage conditions 
 Sponsor information 
 Investigational drug warning 
 Space to enter SN 
 Space to enter the subject’s initials  
 Space to enter the date randomized. 
 
The second panel of the tear-off part is a blinded label ( e.g., sealed, tamper-evident 
envelope, a scratch-off panel or equivalent) which when opened identifies the contents 
of the vials. The blinded lab
el should only be opened in a medical emergency (Section 
5.10.2).  
 
Each study medication vial will be labeled with a one-part label that shows at least the 
following: 
 Subject Kit number (randomization number) 
 Protocol number 
 Target lesion number 
 Vial number 
 Investigational drug warning 
 Space to enter SN 
 Space to enter date of application.

Prior to the start of the study, Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or a designated third party will 
generate a list of randomizat
ion numbers that shall be transmitted to the assigned 
clinical packaging organization for study medication labeling. 
The randomization list will
 be stored with access limited to designated personnel for 
study medication labeling. The randomization list will be made available as appropriate 
to un-blind the database. 
 
5.7.4. Subject randomization 
At Visit 2, an investigational center staff member other than the investigator will assign 
study medication t o eligible su
bjects by selecting Subject Kits in chronological sequence 
and in ascending numerical order starting with the lowest available Subject Kit number 
(the Subject Kit number is the randomization number). No Subject Kit number will be 
omitted or reused. 
 
The sequence of study medications ass
ignment will be randomly assigned. 
 
The investigational center staff member randomizing the subject will enter the SN, 
subject initials and date randomized on both parts of the Subject Kit label, remove the 
tear-off part, attach it to the subject’s  Label Page CRF and  record the Subject Kit number 
in the subject’s CRF.   
 
5.7.5. Dispensing study medication 
The study medications mu
st be applied only to study subjects, only at the 
investigational center and only by authorized personnel as required by applicable 
regulations and guidelines. 
 
At Visit 2, after a subject is randomized (Section 5.7.4 ), locate the appropriate Subject Kit 
and the unused study medication vial with the lowest vial number labeled with each 
target lesion number. Enter the SN and date of application on each vial label. 
 
At Visit 5, perform applic
ation(s) for any target lesion that requires a retreatment 
(Section 5.7.6 ). Locate the appropriate Subject Kit and the unused study medication vial 
with the lowest number lab
eled for the appropriate target lesion number(s). Use a 
different vial from the vial used for the Visit 2 application. Enter the SN and date of 
application on each vial label.

An investigational center staff member other than the investigator will perform all 
study medication applications. The staff member must comply with the study 
medication handling warnings (Section 5.7.1 ) 
 
At Visit 2, the staff member will perform an initial study medication application for 
each target lesion (4 targ
et lesions).  
 
To perform a study m
edication application for a target lesion the investigational center 
staff member will select the appropriate vial of study medication (Section 5.7.5 ). The 
staff member must follow these application instructions: 
 Wash her/his hands prior to, and after completing the study medication 
applications; after completing the study medication applications wash her/his 
hands while still wearing the examination gloves then dispose of the gloves and 
wash her/his hands again  
 Wear examination gloves during the application 
 Hold the study medication vial away from her/his face and from the subject’s 
face when opening 
 Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, 
or open wounds 
 Have the subject l ie pron e with the plane of the target lesion horizontal  
 Thoroughly cleanse the target lesion by firmly rubbing with an alcohol 
swab/wipe to ensure it is clean 
 Using the supplied applicator: 
o Firmly apply a quantity of study medication sufficient to cover the target 
lesion with a thin film 
o Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin (excess study 
medication may be removed from the surrounding skin using a clean 
absorbent wipe) 
o Use an application technique that is appropriate for the target lesion size 
and characteristics ( e.g., dabbing firmly, with moderate pressure, on 
small or smooth lesions; wiping firmly, with moderate pressure, onto 
large or rough lesions) 
o Repeat firm applications to the target lesion with the applicator 
approximately every 30 seconds, adding study medication to the 
applicator as needed to keep the target lesion wetted, for 5-6 minutes 
o Have the subject remain prone and avoid disturbing the target lesion 
until any visible reaction, if any, has stopped 
o Absorb any remaining study medication and dry the target lesion 
without wiping or rubbing the target lesion.   
 
At Visit 2, repeat t
hese steps to make the initial study medication applications to all 4 
target lesions.

have a PLA grade of >0, must receive a retreatment study medication application 
UNLESS the target lesion: 
 Has a Visit 5 pre-application LSR grade of 3 (severe) for any sign or symptom  
 Is, in the investigator’s opinion, not appropriate for a retreatment study 
medication application. 
 
All Visit 5 retreatment
 applications will be terminated for all subjects if 4 or more 
subjects discontinue from the study due to study medication related AEs. 
 
At Visit 5, for target lesions that require retreatment, a staff member, other than the 
investigator, will perform 
the application following the instructions above, using a 
different vial from the vial used for
 the Visit 2 application. 
 
The investigator is pro
hibited from access to any study procedure or document that 
shows the study medication identity except in cases of a medical emergency (Section 
5.10.2).  
 
5.7.7. Dose compliance record 
At every study visit where a study medication application is performed, an 
investigational center staff member will document the study medication usage in the 
CRF. 
 
5.7.8. Dose modification 
Study medication applications will be performed at Visit 2, and if appropriate Visit 5, 
by the investigational center
 staff at the direction of the investigator, no study 
medication will be dispensed to the study subjects. 
 
If any subject refuses to allow a study medication retreatment application the 
investigator must report the visit number, visit date, target lesion number and the 
reason for the refusal in the subject’s CRFs. If the subject’s refusal is associated with an 
AE, the investigator must report the event on the appropriate CRF (Section 7.2). The 
subject does not need to be removed from the study based solely on her/his refusal to 
have a study medication application on any individual target lesion(s).

addition, an accurate study medication disposition record will be kept, specifying the 
amount dispensed for each subject and the date of dispensing. This inventory record 
will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original 
inventory record will be available for review by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. upon request. 
5.8.2. Return and disposition of study supplies
 
At the completion of the study, all used and unused study medication vial s will be 
returned to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee) for disposal per Aclaris 
Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee’s
) written instructions.  
 
5.9. Other Study Supplies 
Aclaris
 Therapeutics, Inc. will provide: 
 Equipment, supplies and instructions for taking standardized photographs 
 Appropriate equipment to assist the subject with the SSA 
 Supplies for identifying, mapping and tracking the location of the target lesions 
 An appropriate ruler, or other instrument, for measuring the Lesion Dimensions. 
 
A third party will 
provide the supplies for collecting, labeling, shipping and result 
reporting for the clinical laboratory tests and urine pregnancy tests.

Blinding is important for validity of this clinical study. However, the blind may be 
broken in the event of a medical emergency, in which knowledge of the study 
medication identity is critical to the management of the subject’s course of treatment. 
Before breaking the blind the investigator should determine that the information is 
necessary (i.e. , that it will alter the subject’s immediate course of treatment). In many 
cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not study medication-related, the 
problem may be effectively managed by assuming that the target lesion is receiving an 
active study medication without the need for un-blinding.  
 
If deemed necessary to break t
he blind for a study subject, attempt to contact the Aclaris 
Therapeutics, Inc. Medical 
Monitor (Section 7.2.2 ) to obtain concurrence. If it is not 
possible to contact the Medical Monitor beforehand, contact her/him as soon as 
possible after breaking the blind for
 a subject. 
 
To identify a subject’s study medication , locate the second panel of the tear-off label 
attached to the subject’s Label Page CRF and follow the instructions on the label. Record 
the date of un-blinding, the reason for un-blinding and the initials of the investigational 
center staff member who performed the un- blinding on the subject’s Label Page CRF. 
At the end of the study, the original Label Page CRFs will be returned to the Sponsor 
with a photocopy placed in the investigator’s study file. The original Label Page CRFs 
will be available, upon request, to the site if needed to respond to a regulatory audit. 
 
Any subject whose blind has been broken must be discharged from the study (Section

The study assessments will be performed according to the schedules note d below by the 
investigator or appropriately trained staff members as noted for each assessment. The 
same individual should perform the assessments for a given subject throughout the 
study. If this becomes impossible, an appropriate designee with overlapping experience 
with the subject and s
tudy should perform the assessments. The same lighting 
conditions and the appropriate subject position (see below) should be used for all 
evaluations. 
 
The following evaluations must be performed with the subject standing: 
 SSA (Section 6.1.1 ) 
 PLA (Section 6.1.2 ) 
 SSK (Section 6.1.4 ) 
 LSR (Section 6.2.1 ).

 Lesion Dimensions (Section 6.1.3 ). 
 
6.1. Effectiveness Evaluations 
The investigator and/or subject will evaluate the following for each target lesion. 
 
6.1.1. Subject’s Self-Assessment (
SSA) 
The SSA must be performed with the subject standing. 
 
The SSA must be completed by the subject BEFORE the investigator performs the PLA .  
 
The SSA is the subject’s assessment of the average overall severity of each target lesion at a 
particular time point and is not a comparison with the SSA at any other time point. The 
subject should NOT refer to any other evaluation to assist with these assessments.  
 
At Visits 2-9, each subject will assess each SK target lesion and report the one integer that 
best describes the average overall severity of each target lesion using the scale below . At 
Visit 2, and if appropriate Visit 5, the SSA must be completed prior to the study 
medication application. 
 
An
 investigational center staff member must educate the subject on the SSA scale at every 
visit. 
 
To perform the SSA assessment subjects must be provided with a handheld mirror, with 
both 1 power and 2 power magnification, and a full-length ( i.e., provides an unobstructed 
view of the target lesion being assessed) mirror. The subject must use the same handheld 
mirror magnification power for all SSA assessments. 
 
To evaluate the target lesions: 
 The subject should stand with her/his back to the full length mirror 
 An investigational staff member will identify each target lesion to the subject in 
numerical order and direct the subject to assess each lesion sequentially 
 The subject should view her/his back using the handheld mirror and full length 
mirror 
 At Visit 2 the staff member will record the handheld mirror magnification power 
the subject used for the assessment (the subject must use the same magnification 
power for all SSA assessments) 
 At Visits 3-9 the staff member will ensure the subject uses the same handheld 
mirror magnification as used for the Visit 2 assessment  
 The staff member should not influence the subject’s assessment.

average overall severity of each target lesion using the following scale. The study staff 
member will report the SSA grade the subject indicates in the source document: 
 
Subject’s Self -Assessment  
Grade  Descriptor  
0 Clear: no lesion is noticeable  
1 Mild: lesion is barely noticeable on careful examination, but is not obvious  
2 Moderate: lesion is obvious on routine examination   
3 Severe: lesion is prominent  
 
Both the subject and the study staff member must sign/initial and date the source 
document to indicate the SSA is reported accurately. 
 
6.1.2. Physician’s L esion Assessment ( PLA ) 
The PLA must be performed with the subject standing. 
 
The investigator must perform the PLA evaluation ONLY AFTER the subject performs the 
SSA and PRIOR
 to the Signs of Seborrheic Keratosis (SSK). The subject and the 
investigator must not discuss the subject’s SSA grade.  
 
The PLA is the investigator’s assessment of the average overall severity of seborrheic 
keratosis on each target lesion at a particular time point, and is based on the investigator’s 
clinical experience evaluating SK lesions on subjects with similar skin types. The 
investigator should NOT refer to any other assessments to assist with this evaluation.  
 
The PLA grade must be ≥ 2 at Visit 1 for the subject to be enrolled and must be ≥ 2 at 
Visit 2 for the subject to be randomized. 
 
At every study visit, the investigator will assess each seborrheic keratosis target lesion and 
report the on
e integer that best describes the average overall severity of each using the 
following scale . For this evaluation the subject must stand in a position similar to the 
position used for the SSA (Section 6.1.1 ). At Visit 2, and if appropriate Visit 5, the 
investigator must perfor
m the PLA prior to the study medication application: 
 
Physician’s Lesion Assessment

The Lesion Dimensions must be measured with the subject prone.  
 
At every study vis
it the investigator or designee will measure the following dimensions 
of each target lesion using the ruler, or equivalent, provided: 
 Surface area: 
o The length of the longest axis, in centimeters (c m) to the nearest 0.1cm 
o The length of the longest axis perpendicular to the first measurement, in 
cm to the nearest 0.1cm 
 Thickness: 
o Height, at its highest point above the surrounding skin, in millimeters 
(mm) reported using the categ
ories below. 
 
At Visit 1 and Visit 2 calculate and report the surface area (cm2) of each target lesion by 
multiplying the length of the longest axis in cm and the length of the longest axis 
perpendicular to the first measurement in cm and report to the nearest 0.1cm.  
 
The area of each target 
lesion must be ≥0.51cm2 and ≤4cm2 at Visit 1 for the subject to be 
enrolled and at Visit 2 for the subject to be randomized. 
 
The lesion thickness
 of each target lesion must be at least palpable and no more than 
3mm (grade 1-3) at Visit 1 for the subject to be enrolled and at Visit 2 for the subject to 
be randomized. Target lesion thick
ness will be reported by category: 
 0: No height above surrounding normal skin 
 1: Palpable to ≤1mm 
 2: >1mm and ≤2mm  
 3: >2mm and ≤3mm  
 4: >3mm and ≤4mm  
 5: >4mm. 
 
At Visit 2, and if appropriate Visit 5, the Lesion Dimensions must be measured prior to 
the study medication application. 
 
6.1.4. Si
gns of Seborrheic Keratosis (SSK) 
The SSK must be performed with the subject standing. 
 
The investigator must perform the SSK evaluation ONLY after completing the PLA. 
 
The SSK is the investigator’s assessment of the average severity of two characteristic 
signs of seborrheic keratosis (pigmentation and surface characteristics) on each target 
lesion at a particular time point. The investigator should NOT refer to any other 
evaluations to assist with this evaluation.

At Visits 2-9, the investigator will evaluate each seborrheic keratosis target lesion and 
report the one integer that best describes the average severity of each sign of seborrheic 
keratosis for each target lesion using the following scales .  
 
At Visit 2, and if appropriate Visit 5, the investigator must perform the SSK assessmen t 
prior to the study medication appli
cation: 
 
Pigmentation  
Grade  Descriptor  
0 Clear: no variation from normal skin pigmentation

cerebriform appearance  
3 Severe: e xtremely abnormal  surface (e.g., rough, waxy) with verrucous and/or 
cerebriform surface  
 
6.2. Safety Evaluations 
6.2.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSR) 
The investigator’s portion of the LSR must be performed with the subject standing.  
 
The LSR assessment is the investigator’s and the subject’s assessment of the average 
overall severity of the signs and symptoms, respectively, associated with irritation on a 
target lesion. The investigator and subject must NOT refer to any other evaluation to assist 
with these a
ssessments. This is not a comparison with the assessment at any other time 
point.

medications) 
o Keloid/hypertrophic scarring 
o Atrophy 
 
 Symptoms (assessed by the subject): 
o Stinging/burning 
o Pruritus (itch). 
 
At Visits 2-9 the investigator and the subject will evaluate the LSR signs and symptoms 
respectively for each target lesion .  
 
The subject will assess the LSR for symptoms as follows: 
 At study visits where a study medication application is performed, report the 
average severity of t
he LSR for symptoms just prior to the start of the study 
medication applications and 10 (±4) minutes after the study medication 
application to the target lesions is completed  
 At study visit where no study medication application is performed, report the 
average severity of the LSR 
for symptoms over the previous 24 hours. 
 
The investigator will assess t
he LSR for signs as follows using the scale below: 
 At study visits where a study medication application is performed report the 
average severity of the LSR for signs prior to the start of the study medication 
applications and 20 (±4) minutes after the study medication application to the 
target lesions is completed  
 At study visit where no study medication application is performed report the 
average severity for each sign.

A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure >100mm Hg is 
considered abnormal and therefore must be defined as clinically relevant ( CR) or NCR 
on the comments page of the CRF.  
 
A weight >300 lbs. is considered abnormal and therefore must be defined as CR or NCR 
on the comments page of the CRF.  
 
6.2.3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, at 
Visit 2 prior to randomization and at Visit 9.  
 
The ECGs must be o
btained using a standard 12-lead ECG with a 10mm/mV 
amplitude, at 25mm/sec and 5-10 second duration. To ensure a steady heart rate the 
subject must rest quietly in the supine position for at least 5 minutes prior to performing 
the ECG.  
 
A normal ECG is defined as
:  
 QTc 450msec for males and 460msec for females (use of the ECG algorithm is 
acceptable for this purpose) 
 Heart rate that is ≥ 50 and ≤100 beats/minutes 
 The tracing must not show any: 
o Rhythm disturbance other than a benign sinus dysrhythmia 
o Conduction disturbance including First Degree A-V Block (PR >200msec) 
and pre-excitation (PR <120msec) 
o Acute or chronic signs of ischemia.   
 
Variations such as minor ST changes ( i.e., <0.5mm depression) and early re-polarization 
are considered normal.  
 
The ECG results must be interpreted by a qualified health professional (evaluator) and 
the interpretation repo
rted either directly on the tracing or in a separate report. If an 
ECG result is abnormal, the evaluator should describe the abnormality and define the 
abnormality as CR or 
NCR. The evaluator will record this information directly on the 
ECG tracing/report and date and initial the tracing/report. 
 
The evaluator must re
view the subject’s Visit 1 ECG prior to Visit 2. The subject must 
not be randomized if the Visit 1 ECG is, in the evaluator’s opinion, abnormal, regardless 
of the clinical relevance.

6.2.5. Urine pregnancy tests 
The investigator or designee will perform a urine pregnancy test for subjects who are 
WOCBP (Section 8) at Visit 1, at Visit 2 prior to randomization and at Visit 9. The urine 
pregnancy test kits 
used must have a minimum sensitivity of 25-mIU ß-HCG/milliliter 
(mL) of urine.  
 
Subjects who are WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test result at Visit 1 to be 
enrolled and at Visit 2 to be randomized. 
 
If the result of any post-randomization urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and the subject’s pregnancy documented and followed 
(Section 8). 
 
6.3. Other Evaluations 
6.3.1. Demographics and medical history 
At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will interview each subject to obtain 
demographic information in
cluding date of birth, sex at birth, skin type, race and, if 
appropriate, ethnicity.  
 
Medical history information will be recorded including all medical conditions, all 
disease states that requir
e concomitant therapy and other medical conditions and 
disease states that, in the opinion of the investigator, are relev ant to the subject’s study 
participation. 
 
6.3.2. Standardized photography 
At every study visit standardized color photographs of each target lesion will be taken. 
At Visit 2, and if appropriate Visit 5, the photographs must be taken prior to the study 
medication application. 
  
Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning 
relative to the camera and camera settings are used for each photograph. Equipment, 
supplies and detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs will be 
provided to the investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study and immediately reported on 
the appropriate Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. AE CRF.   
 
7.1. Definitions 
7.1.1. Adverse events (AE)
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a study medication(s) and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the study medication.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign or symptom associated with the use of a study medication (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), whether or not related to the study medication.  
 
Thus any new, clinica
lly relevant worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease, 
should be considered an AE.  
 
Except for Local Ski
n Reactions, (see below) worsening of any of the target lesion 
assessments must be repo
rted as an AE ONLY if the use of the study medication is 
interrupted or discontinued or if therapy is required to manage the event. Any LSR 
that increases in severity, compared to the Visit 2 pre- application evaluation, by ≥1 
grade AND persists for 2 or more successive visits must be reported as an AE.  
 
The investigator must 
report the target lesion number(s) for any AE associated with a 
target lesion and should question the subject in detail to determine if there are any 
confounding factor s (e.g., irritation by clothing or activity, sunburn) for any such AE.  
 
Every new episode or clinically relevant worsening of a chronic condition ( e.g., 
headaches, seasonal allergies, depression, and hypertension) should be reported as a 
separate AE, even if the condition is reported in the subject’s medical history.  
 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, 
symptoms or clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. 
Otherwise, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the 
AE. 
 
Any CR abnormality disc
overed prior to the first study medication application should 
be reported as medical history, not as an AE.

A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life threatening 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is an important medical event. 
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it was more severe. 
 
Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the 
hospital on an in-patient basis, even if released the same day. Prolongation of 
hospitalization is defined as an addi
tional night stay in the hospital. Hospitalization for 
a diagnostic test (even if related to an AE) or elective hospitalization that was planned 
before study enrollment (signing the ICF) are not themselves reasons for an event to be 
defined as a SAE. 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result 
in death or hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may 
jeopardize the subject or
 require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
the SAE definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. 
 
7.1.3. Unexpected adverse event 
An AE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
 
7.1.4. Adverse event reporting period 
Non-serious AEs must be reported starting when the subject performs the first study 
medication application until the end of the subject’s last study visit. SAEs must be 
reported starting when t
he subject signs the ICF until the end of the subject’s last visit.

The investigator is to define the severity each AE using the following definitions as a 
guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event 
and identify the severity that is the most appropriate according her/his medical 
judgment. 
 
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated 
Modera te – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity 
Severe  – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity. 
 
7.1.6. Relationship to study medication 
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the 
study medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical 
judgment and consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the 
event, the subject’s relevant medical history, concomitant therapies and concurrent 
conditions) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The 
investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the study medication by selecting 
one of the following categories: 
 
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE. 
 
Not Related  – There is not 
a reasonable possibility that there is a causal 
relationship between the study medication and the AE. 
 
The term “reasonable causal 
relationship” means there are facts or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A). 
 
7.2. Reporting Procedures 
7.2.1. Procedures fo
r reporting adverse events 
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator will question the subject to elicit AEs 
using a non-directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since 
the previous study visit? ” The investigator will also question the subject in the same 
manner to eli cit AEs during visits when study medication applications are conduct ed.  
 
If appropriate, based on the subject’s response , directed follow-up questions and 
appropriate evaluations should be conducted.

documents and on the appropriate AE CRF.  
 
AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medication s will be followed until 
they are resolved or until the subject’s last study visit . AEs that are defined as “Related” 
to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after 
the subject’s last study visit, until i n the opinion of the investigator, the AE reaches a 
clinically stable outco
me with or without sequelae. 
 
7.2.2. Procedure for reporting a serious adverse event
 
Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or 
not related to the study medications, the investigator must:

WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not 
undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or 
bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as ≥12 months with no 
menses without an alternative medical cause). Women who are using an active method 
of birth control, are
 practicing abstinence, or where the partner is sterile ( e.g., 
vasectomy), should be consider
ed to be WOCBP. 
 
All WOCBP must use 
an effective method of birth control during the course of the 
study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Effective methods of birth 
control approved for use in this study are: 
 Implants 
 Injectables 
 Patch 
 Combined oral contraceptives 
 ParaGard® or Mirena® intrauterine devices 
 Condom with spermicide; diaphragm with spermicide 
 Vasectomized partner. 
 
Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for a pregnancy.  The 
subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  During the 
trial all WOCBP will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they 
suspect they might be pregnant ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period). 
 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
medication administration, the study medication must be withheld until the results of a 
pregnancy test are available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive 
study medication and must be discharged from the study.  
 
If, following study medicat
ion administration, it is determined that the subject may 
have been or was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including at least 
2 days after study medicat
ion administration) the investigator must immediately notify 
the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Medical Monitor and record the event on a pregnancy 
surveillance form. While not an AE or SAE, every pregnancy must be reported using a 
pregnancy surveillance form and follow the reporting procedures described for SAE 
reporting (Section 7.2.2 ).

Protocol-required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow-up must be 
performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy ( e.g., x-ray studies). 
Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated. 
In addition, the investigator must report to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. ’s Medical Monitor 
on the pregnancy surveillance form, follow-up information regarding the course of the 
pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a 
minimum of six weeks. 
  
9. STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
9.1. Statistical Analysis of Clinical Indices 
The primary effectiveness analyses will be pairwise comparisons between Vehicle and 
each active study medication, based on mean change from Visit 2 PLA, using a 
repeated-measures Analysis of Cov
ariance model suitable for the study design.  Study 
medication concentration is the within-subject independent variable.  The Visit 2 score 
will be the covariate.  The primary
 analysis visit will be Visit 9.  An exploratory dose-
response analysis may be conduc
ted across concentrations to evaluate a concentration 
trend, as well as an exploratory longitudinal analysis across visits to evaluate trends 
over time. 
 
Secondary efficacy analyses will include a similar analysis of SSA, SSK and other 
evaluations suitable for analysis as continuous variables.  Separate primary and 
secondary effectiveness analyses at each post-baseline visit will be conducted.  In 
addition, secondary analyses will be performed on proportion of PLA and SSA 
responders, where a subject will be considered a responder if the Visit 9 score is 0. A 
similar analysis will be
 done at Visit 5. Chi-square will be used to analyze differences in 
response rates under the as
sumption that lesions within a subject may be treated 
independently, along with a repeated-measures logistic regression model applied as an 
optional exploratory analysis method. 
 
For all analyses two-tail alpha will be set at 0.05 with no adjustment for multiplicity due 
to the exploratory nature of the study.  The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as 
subjects with data for both Visit 2 and at least one post-Visit 2, will be the primary 
analysis population, supplanted by analyses of the Per-Protocol (PP) population 
defined as ITT subjects with no missing effectiveness data and no major protocol 
violations. ITT population analyses will use las
t-observation-carried-forward to impute 
missing post-Visit 2 data.

Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the intent- to-treat 
population, defined as those subjects who were randomized and received at least one 
study medication application.  The proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent 
adverse events will be tabulated and presented by treatment and Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class.  Vital signs, clinically-relevant 
ECG results, LSR scores and clinically-relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be 
tabulated and presented by study medication and abrasion cohort.  No inferential 
testing will be performed. 
 
Data from all randomized subjects will be presented and summarized. Safety 
summaries by study medication group will include listings by study medication of 
adverse events incidences within each MedDRA System Organ Class, and changes from 
pre-application values in vital signs.  Adverse event summaries will be presented by 
study medication showing the proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, both 
overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class. 
 
9.3. Sample Size 
The sample size of 32 subjects completing this study was based on the estimated 
primary efficacy variabl
e response rates for the most effective active medication and 
vehicle, which are expected to be approximately 60% and 10% respectively.  This 
difference is expected to yield approximately 88% power using a standard chi-square 
test under the assumption of lesio
n independence.

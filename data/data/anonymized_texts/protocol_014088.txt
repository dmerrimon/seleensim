PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  Measuring Renuvion Soft Tissue Contraction Using Ultrasound  
Investigational Device:  The Renuvion Generator (K192867) is  indicated for delivery of radiofrequency energy 
and/or helium plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and 
laparoscopic surgical procedures. The Renuvion APR Handpiece (K223262) is intended for 
the delivery of radiofrequency energy and/or helium plasma where 
coagulation/contraction of soft tissue is needed. Soft tissue includes subcutaneous tissue. 
The Renuvion® APR Handpiece is indicated for use in subcutaneous dermatological and 
aesthetic procedures to improve the appearance of lax (loose) skin in the neck and 
submental region. The Renuvion® APR Handpiece is intended to be used with compatible 
electrosurgical ge nerators owned by Apyx Medical.  
 The Apyx One Console (K221830) is indicated for delivery of radiofrequency energy and/or 
helium plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic 
surgical procedures. The helium plasma portion of the generator can be used only with 
dedicated Renuvion/J -Plasma handpieces.  
 Together, the Renuvion Generator and Handpiece are referred to as the Renuvion APR 
System.  
Development Phase:  Post -Marketing   
Study Purpose : The purpose of this study is to quan titatively measure the amount of soft tissue 
contraction produced by the delivery of Renuvion helium plasma energy to the 
subcutaneous connective tissue.  
Brief Study Overview:  This is a prospective, single -center, non -randomized study of up to 5 subjects who are 
receiving treatment with the Renuvion APR system following power- assisted liposuction  
in the abdomen per investigator standard of care. Subjects may also have other body areas 
treated at the same time. Demographic information, medical history, and procedure 
details will be documented. Pre - and post- procedure care are per investigator stand ard of 
care and documented. Video may be taken during the procedure.  
 
Ultrasound images  of soft tissue contraction will be taken on abdomen prior to and during 
the procedure . Measurements of contraction will be calculated from the ultrasound 
images by an ultrasonographer. At baseline, photographs will be taken of the treatment 
areas. Surface area measurements will be taken of each treatment area prior to study 
treatment.  
 Post -procedure care will be as per investigator standard of care and documented. All 
adverse events and expected treatment effects will be documented.  
 
Follow- up photographs and ultrasound images will be captured at D30, D45,  D60,  D90, 
D180, D270, & D365.

only).  
Exclusion Criteria:  • BMI of greater than 35.  
• Diabetes  mellitus with A1C score >7.  
• Active cigarette smokers or nicotine vape users. 
• History of connective tissue disease ( Ehlers Danlos, Cutis Laxa, Pseudoxanthoma 
Elasticum, Marfan's, etc .) 
• Patient s who, in the opinion of the investigat or, is not an appropriate candidate for 
the study.  
• Patients requiring a concomitant procedure in the Renuvion treatment area that 
could impact the ultrasound measurements or the effectiveness results . 
Primary Outcome 
Measures:  Analysis  of contraction  meas ured by an ultrasonographer  and then analyzed  as follows:  
• Quantify the amount of intra -operative contraction produced by liposuction . 
• Quantify the amount of intra- operative contraction produced by each pass of 
Renuvion.   
• Determine if amount of intra -operative contraction produced by Renuvion begins 
to level off (reach a point of diminishing return).   
• Determine how the amount of intra- operative contraction varies based on the 
initial length at baseline .  
• Correlate the amount of intra -operative co ntraction to energy delivered . 
• Determine how the amount of contraction changes over time . 
• Correlate the amount of contraction to GAIS and PSQ .  
• Correlate the amount of contraction or energy delivered to AEs . 
• Correlate the amount of contraction to IPR review . 
Additional  Outcome 
Measures:  1. Improvement in appearance of skin laxity in the treatment area assessed by selection 
of the correct post -treatment image as determined by a masked, qualitative

2. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE 
2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  & RATIONALE  
Energy has been applied in some form to tissue since the beginning of recorded history.  The practic e of applying 
heat to tissue through the use of cauteries was used for thousands of years as an invaluable method of controlling 
hemorrhage.  Continuous improvement of methods for utilizing the beneficial effects of heat on tissue eventually 
led to the dev elopment of the basic concepts of electrosurgery we know today.  In October of 1926, Dr. Harvey 
Cushing used an electrosurgical unit developed by Dr. William T. Bovie to successfully remove a highly vascularized brain tumor from a patient after previous failed attempts.  Today, electrosurgical instruments are used in almost 
every surgical procedure performed worldwide.
1 
Through this long history, the heat effects of the radiofrequency (RF) alternating current used in electrosurgery on 
cells and tissue have been well established.  Normal body temperature is 37°C and, with normal illness, can increase 
to 40°C without permanent impact or damage to the cells of our body.  However, when the temperature of cells in 
tissue reaches 50°C, cell death occurs in approximately 6 minutes.2  When the temperature of cells in tissue reaches 
60°C, cell death occurs instantaneously.3  Between the temperatures of 60°C and just below 100°C, two simultaneous 
processes occur.1  The first is protein denaturation leading to coagulation which will be discussed in more detail 
below.  The second is desiccation or dehydration as the cells lose water through the thermally damaged cellular wall.  
As temperatures rise above 100°C, intracellular water turns to steam and tissue cells begin to vaporize as a result of 
the massive intracellular expansion that occurs.  Finally, at temperatures of 200°C o r more, organic molecules are 
broken down into a process called carbonization.  This leaves behind carbon molecules that give a black and/or 
brown appearance to the tissue.  
 Understanding these heat effects of RF energy on cells and tissue can allow the pr edictable changes to be used to 
accomplish beneficial therapeutic results.  Protein denaturation leading to soft tissue coagulation is one of the most 
versatile and widely utilized tissue effects.  Protein denaturation is the process in which hydrothermal bonds 
(crosslinks) between protein molecules, such as collagen, are instantaneously broken and then quickly reformed as 
tissue cools.  This process leads to the formation of uniform clumps of protein typically called coagulum through a 
subsequent process k nown as coagulation.  In the process of coagulation, cellular proteins are altered but not 
destroyed and form protein bonds that create homogenous, gelatinous structures.  The resulting tissue effect of 
coagulation is extremely useful and most commonly use d for occluding blood vessels and causing hemostasis.  
 
In addition to causing hemostasis, coagulation results in predictable contraction of soft tissue.  Collagen is one of the 
main proteins found in human skin and connective tissue.  The coagulation/denat uration temperature of collagen is 
conventionally stated to be 66.8°C, although this can vary for different tissue types.
4  Once denatured, collagen 
rapidly contracts as fibers shrink to one -third of their overall length.5  This principal of thermally -indu ced contraction 
of collagen through denaturation and coagulation of soft tissue is well known in medicine and is used to achieve 
beneficial results in ophthalmology, orthopedic applications, and the treatment of varicose veins.  Once tissue is 
heated to th e appropriate temperature, protein denaturation and collagen contraction occur resulting in a reduction 
of volume and surface area of the heated tissue.  Noninvasive use of RF devices, lasers, and plasma devices have been used for the reduction of facial w rinkles and rhytides caused by thermal -induced collagen/tissue contraction 
since the mid -1990s.

Title: Measuring Renuvion Soft Tissue Contraction Using Ultrasound  Clinical Trial Protocol

Minimally invasive devices that deliver thermal energy in the same subcutaneous tissue planes in which liposuction 
is performed have achieved the appropria te balance between excisional and non- invasive procedures.  Laser -
assisted liposuction (LAL) has shown to be effective at producing more skin tightening than suction- assisted 
liposuction (SAL) alone18,1 9.  DiBernardo showed an average skin surface area red uction of 22% and 17% at one - and 
three- month follow- up visits, respectively, and an average of 26% skin tightening at three months when utilizing LAL 
to address abdominal skin laxity20.  In 2008, radiofrequency (RF) devices were introduced and have demons trated 
efficacy in multiple body areas including the abdomen21,22, the arms23,24, and the face and neck25,26.  The efficacy 
results in all of these publications are based on contraction measurements taken on the surface of the skin.  Although skin surface contraction measurements are useful, they are limited for the following reasons:  
• The mechanism of action (especially of Renuvion) is to treat and contract the fibro septal connective tissue.  
This contraction of the connective tissue draws the skin closer to the underlying muscle, and this, in turn, 
improves the appearance of the skin by reducing the laxity.  When addressing skin laxity through the three -
dimensional contraction of the connective tissue, the overall magnitude of improvement may not al ways 
be reflected in surface area changes on the skin surface.  To date, no studies have measured the amount of 
contraction of the connective tissue itself.  
• Using camera -based measurements of skin surface area changes do not allow for quantification of intra -
operative (on the table) changes.  
• Using camera -based measurements of skin surface area changes requires split -body treatments to 
differentiate between the results produced by liposuction and the energy device.  
 
Due to these limitations, having another w ay to quantify and visualize contraction will be helpf ul. This study will use 
ultrasound images to visualize the contraction throughout the procedure and during follow -up. Utilizing those 
ultrasound images, this study will provide the ability to quantitati vely measure the amount of soft tissue contraction 
produced by the delivery of Renuvion helium plasma energy to the subcutaneous connective tissue.  
 
2.1.1  RENUVION SYSTEM DEVICE AND INDICATIONS FOR USE 
The Renuvion APR system consists of a handpiece (Figure 1), an electrosurgical unit (ESU, Figure 2), and a supply of 
helium gas (Figure 2).  RF energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode.  When 
helium gas is passed over the energized  electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the 
RF energy from the electrode to the subject in the form of a precise helium plasma beam.

2.2 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
2.2.1 POTENTIAL RISKS 
This treatment modality was designed to inherently minimize the risk to the subject. However, treatment with 
energy -based modalities (laser, radiofrequency, and plasma devices) produce subsequent heating of the soft tissue 
that could involve the following commonly Expected Treatment Effects (ETEs): discomfort/pain, edema, erythema, 
ecchymosis, hypoesthesia, temporary sensory nerve injury (touch sensitivity, itching, temporary numbness/tingling), 
transient migratory firmness, and temporary and/or transient crepitus.  
 
In addition to commonly expected treatment effects, treatment with the Renuvion system could involve the 
following risks: helium em bolism into the surgical site due to inadvertent introduction into the venous or arterial

blood supply system, unintended burns (deep or superficial), pneumothorax, temporary or permanent motor nerve 
injury, ischemia, fibrosis, infection, gas buildup, blee ding, hematoma, seroma, subcutaneous induration, 
pigmentation changes, increased healing time, unsatisfactory scarring, asymmetry and/or unacceptable cosmetic result.  
 
Risks associated with tumescent anesthesia (lidocaine and epinephrine) include blurred v ision, mental/mood 
changes, drowsiness, dizziness, unusually slow heartbeat, rash, itching, swelling, anxiety, apprehensiveness, 
restlessness, tremor, weakness, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea and vomiting, headache, and respiratory difficulties.  
 
Subjects using drugs that reduce coagulation (aspirin or NSAIDs) may experience increased bruising or bleeding at 
the treatment site. Any other medication prescribed for the procedure or after -procedure by the investigator have 
their own risks; these risks should be discussed with the subject.  
 A grounding pad is used to ground/neutralize the electrical current. Subjects undergoing radiofrequency treatment 
will be kept away from contact with metal parts which are grounded, or which have appreciable capacitance to 
earth.  
 
Any unexpected or unforeseen complications will be managed by the investigator throughout the conduct of the 
study. Unforeseen or unexpected side effects not listed above will be reported to the sponsor and regulatory 
representatives (IRB/EC)  as they occur.  
 
2.2.1.1 
 MINIMIZATION OF POTENTIAL RISKS 
These risks are mitigated by utilizing qualified clinical Investigators who have training and are experienced in  
procedures delivering radiofrequency energy and/or helium plasma where coagulation/co ntraction of soft tissue is 
needed  and in the use of ultrasound systems.   In addition, risks are mitigated by including only those subjects that 
meet the study eligibility criteria. This study also includes evaluation of study subject satisfaction with thi s procedure. 
Given the anticipated acceptable risk, the risk -benefit assessment of the use of the Renuvion APR  device  to deliver 
radiofrequency energy and/or helium plasma where coagulation/contraction of soft tissue is needed  appears to 
offer a substantial clinical benefit at a reasonable risk.  
2.2.2 POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The benefit of this study is to add to the industry knowledge base a better understanding of the 
coagulation/contraction of soft tissue produced by the Renuvion APR system. Subjects enrolled in this study will 
receive the benefit of using the Renuvion APR device for the coagulation/contraction of soft tissue.

will be indicated on the Study Exit CRF.   
5.6 PREMATURE TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE STUDY  OR A STUDY  SITE 
The study or a study site can be prematurely terminated or suspended by the sponsor. Reasons for termination of 
the study or a study  site may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Subject enrol lment is unsatisfactory.  
• The risks and benefits of continuing the study  have been reassessed, and the risks outweigh any potential 
benefits.  
• The incidence of AEs constitutes a potential health hazard to the subjects.  
• New scientific data do not justify a continuation of the study . 
• The investigator or study site exhibit serious a nd/or persistent non -adherence to the protocol , the 
Declaration of Helsinki, EN ISO 14155, and/or applicable regulatory requirements.  
• The sponsor decides to terminate the study  at any time for any other reason.  
Furthermore, the study  may be prematurely ended if the regulatory authority or the IRB  has decided to terminate 
or suspend approval for the study , the study  site, or the investigator.  
 If the study  is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, the investigator must inform the subjects  and 
assure appropriate follow -up treatment. Within the timeframes noted in applicable regulations, the sponsor will 
promptly inform the investigators, study  sites, the IRB , and regulatory authorities  of the termination or suspension 
of the study , as well as provide reasons for the action.

Revision: 0 3  Page 26 of 45 
6.2 ACCOUNT ABILITY  
The investigator, or designee, must maintain an inventory record using the site -specific Device Disposition Form of 
study devices received, used for treatment, and returned to the Sponsor to ensure that the investigational device 
will not be dispensed to any person who is not a subject under the terms and conditions set forth in this protocol. 
There will be 100% acco untability for all study devices.  The clinical study site shall maintain all devices received for 
clinical trial use in a locked, limited access cabinet or room until the end of the study unless they are returned to 
Apyx while the study is being conducted,  such as at the end of study treatments.  
6.3 DEVICE MALFUNCTION /OBSERVATION  
All malfunctions of, or defects of the delivery system will be reported to the Sponsor by the study  sites.  This will 
include situations where the delivery system did not perform a s intended; user errors; study device/component 
being physically defective, including out of the box failure.  
7. STUDY  PROCEDURES  AND  SCHEDULE  
7.1 PRE-PROCEDURE  
Study subjects will have verification of eligibility criteria, a brief general examination including medical history, and 
pre-procedure assessments as detailed below completed within 30 days prior to undergoing the study procedure. 
In response to the ongoi ng coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) pandemic, preoperative testing can be completed at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  Pre -operative testing should be performed as close to the scheduled study procedure as 
feasible, but in time to get the results. Up to two urine pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to study procedure for females with child -bearing potential (one at pre -procedure screening and one on the day of the procedure prior 
to the procedure if pre- procedure screening and procedure are not performed o n the same day).  
The following pre -treatment assessments will be performed:  
• 2D photographic images will be captured. The same standardized photography views will be used 
throughout the study.   
• Urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential).  
• General physical exam including medical history, vital signs, collection of patient demographic information, and BMI.  
 
Medications subject is taking upon entry into the study should also be documented in the Case Report Forms (CRF). All concomitant prescription medications taken during study participation will be recorded on the appropriate study 
specific CRF. For this pro tocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a 
properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported on the CRF and entered on the eCRF are 
concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter me dications, and non- prescription medications.  
Medication used for analgesia and/or anesthesia should be recorded as concomitant medication as well. To ensure 
the capture of the foregoing information on pre -existing conditions, sites should also be attentive  to the need to 
document without limitation and whenever discovered: (1) all chronic, episodic or ‘as needed’ medications used 
before study enrollment; (2) prior episodic or ‘as needed’ therapeutic interventions, procedures or hospitalizations; 
and, (3) re cent or planned surgical procedures.   
7.2 STUDY PROCEDURE  
On the day of the procedure and prior to the study procedure, female subjects with child- bearing potential must 
complete a urine pregnancy test (result must be obtained prior to the procedure), see Table 4.

Revision: 0 3  Page 27 of 45 
Medications at investigator discretion may be provided . 
The abdominal procedure utilizing the Renuvion APR system will be performed per the investigator’s standard 
clinical practice. Subjects may also have other body areas treated at the same ti me. Procedure data and adverse 
events will be captured.  
Ultrasound Measurements of the abdomen will be collected intra -operatively (pre- treatment, post- liposuction, post 
each Renuvion pass).  Video may be taken during the procedure.  
7.3 FOLLOW -UP PROCEDURES   
7.3.1  IMMEDIATELY POST-PROCEDURE  
Following the procedure, the research staff and the subject will care for the treated areas using the Post -Procedure 
Care Instructions per the Investigator’s standard clinical practice .  
7.3.2 FOLLOW -UP VISITS & SUBJECT CONTACT OUTSIDE OF FOLLOW -UP VISITS 
The Investigator will follow- up with the study subjects per their Standard of Care (SOC), at the following time -points:  
• 30 (±4) days  
• 45 (±10) days  
• 60 (±10) days  
• 90 (±10) days  
• 180 (±15) days  
• 270 (±15) days  
• 365 (±15) days  
 
Post -procedure assessments, ultrasound imaging,  and 2D photographic imaging will be performed during the follow -
up visits, see Table 4. The same standardized photography views and ultrasound imaging will be used throughout 
the study as documented in the image capture document developed for the study.  
Due to the challenges of COVID- 19, if a subject is unable to return to the office for an in- person visit, follow- up visits 
will be conducted virtually. If a visit is completed virtually, missing assessments such as photographs will be 
documented as a protocol deviation specifically noting COVID -19. Outside of photographs, study investigators and 
study staff will ensure all other assessments related to eac h follow -up visit are completed virtually if the visit is done 
virtually. For virtual visits, the investigator and/or study staff completing the visit and assessments will be identified 
on the case report form; as well, the manner in which the visit was co mpleted will also be recorded (i.e., video call, 
phone call, etc.). Virtual visits should be done via video call, if possible, to ensure subject identity. If a telephone call  
must be done, the investigator and/or study staff must positively identify the su bject prior to conducting the virtual 
visit by requesting the subject to state their address and date of birth. Subjects will be strongly encouraged to come 
in (albeit safely) for their D 365 visit; this visit is vitally important as this is the primary end point and photographic 
images are needed for many of the assessments. Only investigators and study staff who have been trained and 
delegated to conduct virtual visits as indicated on the delegation log may conduct virtual study visits.  
Subjects may be seen for an unscheduled appointment at any time at investigator’s discretion.  
Study staff will contact (phone, text, email, video call at subject’s preference) all subjects with ongoing Adverse 
Events at regular intervals. If the subject is unreachable by the preferred method of contact, another method of 
contact may be attempted.

unscheduled visit.  
 
7.5.7 END OF STUDY  (COMPLETION ) 
All subjects who have signed an Informed Consent Form  will be considered enrolled in the study. Subjects who 
complete the study duration will be considered to have completed the study. The end of study will be defined as 
completion of all study visits by all enrolled subjects. If a device -related AE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device -
related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subject will be followed until resolution, until the condition 
stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow- up.  
 A study closure v isit may be conducted at the study site in order to review record retention requirements, device 
disposition requirements, etc., with site personnel.  The Sponsor may choose to conduct the closure visit via 
telephone contact if appropriate.  
8. ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
8.1 SPECIFICATIONS OF SAFETY PARAMETERS  
8.1.1  DEFINITION OF AN EXPECTED TREATMENT EFFECT (ETE)  AND AN ADVERSE EVENT (AE) 
An expected treatment effect  (ETE) is defined as any typical treatment side -effect of Renuvion APR of mild to 
moderate severity and lasting up to a typical maximum duration.  An  adverse event  (AE) is defined as any new 
medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a subject while enrolled in the study, 
whether or not it is considered device -related by the investigator.

Revision: 0 3  Page 31 of 45 
A preexisting condition (one that is present at the start of the study) will be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, 
intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. Neither the condition, hospital ization, 
prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances: hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition. Surgery should 
not be reported as  an outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome 
was uneventful.  
 
All ETEs and AEs will be collected during the conduct of this trial.   
8.1.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) 
Each adverse event should be assessed for its seriousness. The definition below should be used for this assessment. 
Please note that the term serious adverse event is not synonymous with a “severe” adverse event, which may be 
used to describe the intensity of an event experienced b y the subject.  
 
An adverse event should be classified as serious if it meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Death  
Death was an outcome of the adverse event.  
b. Life-threatening  
The subject was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event or  use or continued use of 
the device.  
c. Hospitalization (initial or prolonged)  
Admission to the hospital or prolongation of hospitalization was a result of the adverse event.  
d. Disability or Permanent Damage  
The adverse event resulted in a substantial disruptio n of a person's ability to conduct normal life 
functions, i.e., the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of li fe. 
e. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect  
Exposure to a medical product prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child.  
f. Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage (Devices) 
Medical or surgical in tervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body function, 
or prevent permanent damage to a body structure, either situation suspected to be due to the use of 
a medical product.  
g. Other Serious (Important Medical Events)  
The event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes.  
 Non -serious adverse events are all events that do not meet the criteria for a “serious”  adverse event.  
8.1.3  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS (EVENTS ) 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life -
threatening problem, or death caused by, or associated with, a device; if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, or application (including

supplementary application), or any other unanticipated serious pro blem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”  
8.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AN EVENT  
8.2.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
Each adverse event should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event experienced by the subject, using 
the following classifications:  
 
• Mild:  easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday 
activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
• Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere wit h normal everyday activities.  These events are 
usually relieved by simple therapeutic measures.  
• Severe:   prevents normal, everyday activities.  These events may require systemic drug therapy or other 
medical treatment.  
8.2.2  RELATIONSHIP TO THE INVESTIGA TIONAL DEVICE  
The relationship to the study device and/or procedure will be determined by the investigator utilizing the following 
categories:  
• Not Related:  An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified – e.g., concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is highly unlikely.  
• Related: The adverse event follows a reas onable temporal sequence related to treatment by the device 
and/or study procedure, follows a known or suspected response pattern and a plausible alternative etiology 
cannot be identified.  
• Undetermined: The relation of the adverse event has some temporal r elationship to the device and/or 
study procedure, is not clearly due to another condition and the involvement of the study device is 
unknown.  
8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may  come to the attention of study  personne l during a study visit or upon review by 
a study m onitor. All ETEs and A Es will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information  to be collected includes event 
description, date  of onset, clinician’s assessment of seriousness and s everity, relationship to study device/treatment  
(assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a determination ), actions taken, an d date of event 
resolution . All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All device 
related  ETEs/AEs assessed as “not yet resolved” must continue to be followed via telephone contact, email or clinic 
visit as per the physician’s direction until event r esolution or stabilization .   
 
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a substantial increase in 
severity or frequency of the problem that has not been attributed to natural history. Chan ges in the severity of an 
event will be documented to allow for a determination if the event should be re -categorized from an ETE to AE.   
Safety evaluations for this study include an interview with the study subject at each follow -up visit by the Investigator 
or delegated study staff to elicit information about any medical occurrence that meets the definition of Adverse 
Event. This information will be documented in CRF without regard for cause or relation to device and/or procedure.

Form -CLA-003- 001                                                 Title: Clinical Trial Protocol  
Revision: 0 3  Page 33 of 45 
Subjects may be asked by the study investigator  to come into the site at any time to assess adverse events.  
Study investigators are provided liberty to mitigate adverse events as deemed necessary per IHC GCP Guidelines 
E6(R2)4.3.2 which states “During and following a subject’ s participation in a trial, the investigator/institution should 
ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a subject for any adverse events related to the trial”.  
Adverse event resolution dates will be determined by investigator using either in -perso n or remote (phone, video 
call, text, email, etc.) examinations or communication with the subject.  To ensure the most accurate reporting of 
adverse event durations, investigators are instructed not to wait until scheduled office follow -up visits to assess  
resolution.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to determine seriousness, severity, and relatedness of the Adverse Event to the 
device and procedure using the definitions in this protocol.  
The PI will record all repor table events with start dates occurring any time after informed  consent is obtained until 
7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study visit, the 
investigator will inqui re abou t the occurrence of ETEs/ AEs/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for 
outcome information  until resolution or stabilization. 
8.4 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
8.4.1  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Expected Treatment Effects (ETEs) observed by study subjects, investigators, or other 
study staff from first exposure to the study product through last study follow -up visit will be recorded. If a device -
related AE, ETE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subj ect will 
be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator should make every effort to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate, as completely as practical, the nature and/or causality of the AE or 
SAE. This may include unscheduled follow up visits for AE assessment.  
 
Study subjects will be instructed in the ICF, post -treatment take home instruction s, and verbally by study staff to 
report all AEs to the clinical study staff.  AE information will be collected throughout the duration of the study and 
recorded on CRFs. Subjects experiencing ongoing adverse events will be contacted as per Section 8. 3.                                                                                                                                                
 
Any new medical problem, or an exacerbation of an existing condition, reported from the time the informed consent 
form is signed must be followed until the last study visit after the last study treatment or until event resolution.   
AEs will not be followed up after the final study visit, which is scheduled <add time period in days, weeks or months> 
after the last stu dy treatment.  
8.4.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours but in no 
event later than 72 hours. Any AE  considered se rious by the  PI or Sub-investigator, or which meets the defi nition 
of an SAE included in Definition of Serious Adverse Event must  be documented  on an SAE CRF.   
 
The Sponsor will conduct an investigation . If the Sponsor determines that the investigation presents an unreasonable 
risk to subjects, all investigations or parts of the investigation presenting that risk will be terminated as soon as 
possible. The investigator must report serious adverse events to the reviewing IRB /FDA according to the IRB /FDA 
regulations.

Revision: 0 3  Page 34 of 45 
8.4.3  UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT REPORTING  
If an unanticipated adverse device effect occurs, t he study investigator shall complete the appropriate study  specific 
CRF and submit to the study sponsor and to the reviewing  IRB as  soon as possible, b ut in no event later than 10 
working days after  the investigator firs t learns of the effect. The study sponsor contact information is provided in 
Apyx Medical Study Contact List . The  study sponsor is responsible for conducting  an evaluation of an u nanticipated 
adverse device effect and shall report the results of such evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRBs  and partici pating 
investigators within  10 working days after the spon sor firs t receives notice of the effect. Thereaf ter the sponsor shall 
submit such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA requests. 
8.4.4 REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
Each pregnancy that starts during the subject’s study participation must be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Pregnancies and pregnancy follow -up should be reported on 
an Adverse Event form. Pregnanc y follow -up should describe the outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary 
or spontaneous discontinuation; details of the birth; the presence or absence of any congenital abnormalities, birth 
defects, maternal or newborn complications, and their rel ation to the device or treatment. Each pregnancy must be 
reported as a non -serious AE if the subject has received at least one study treatment.  The following criteria should 
be followed:  
• If a subject becomes pregnant after the Baseline visit and all study treatments have been completed, the 
subject should continue to be followed for the duration of the pregnancy.  
• If a subject becomes pregnant after the Baseline visit but before any study treatments, the subject should 
be exited from the study.  
• If a su bject becomes pregnant after the Baseline visit but before all study treatments have been completed, 
additional study treatments should be discontinued,  and the subject should continue to be followed for the 
duration of the pregnancy.  
8.4.5 REPORTING OF DEATHS 
The investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours but in no event later than 
48 hours, of learning of a subject’s death, regardless of whether the death is related or unrelated to the 
investigational device. The investigator should attempt to determine, as conclusively as possible, whether the death 
is related to the device. The cause of death and the investigator’s discussion regarding whether or not the death was 
device -related should be described in a written r eport. The investigator mush report death to the reviewing IRB 
according to the IRB regulations at the study site.  
8.5 STUDY HALTING RULES 
This clinical trial will be halted  if subjects’ safety is questioned based on a reporting of severe, device -related AEs at 
an excessive frequency.  The Sponsor and/or investigator may recommend termination or modification of the study 
if there is an occurrence of any device-  or treatment- related Serious Adverse Event, using the clinical protocol 
definitions of Serious Adverse Event. In addition, termination or modification may be recommended for any other 
perceived safety concern based on clinical judgment, including but not limited to a sev ere burn (anticipated or 
unanticipated), a higher than anticipated rate for any component of the safety measures, device failures resulting in 
Adverse Events, or unexpected SAEs. T he study sponsor will notify all investigators to immediately halt  any 
conti nuing enrollment activities and not enroll any additional  study partici pants.  The study sponsor will inform the 
IRB/ FDA of the temporary halt and the di sposition of the study.

All study devices and/or other materials collected will be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless 
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Sponsor.  
 
Subjects should be identified only by initials and unique subject numbers on study  specific CRFs . If necessary, their 
full names may be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized officials.  Information to be stored on the 
computer will be identified by subject ID and will be password protected.  
14. DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPING  
14.1  DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at t he site under the supervision of the site PI. The  
investigator is  responsible for ensu ring the accuracy, completeness,  legib ility, and timeline ss of the data reported.  
 
During each subject’s visit to the clinic, study data will be documented by study personnel on study- specific Case 
Report Forms  (CRFs) prior to entry into an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  Subject demographic information, 
procedural data, adverse events, device observations, and study requir ed assessments will be documented on the 
CRFs  by delegated site personnel.  Study subjects will complete Modified Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) 
Evaluations at protocol specified follow -up visits. Subjects will complete a Satisfaction Survey at the 60-day, 90-day, 
180-day, 270 -day, and 365 -day follow- up visit s. In addition, study personnel will record progress notes to document 
all significant observations, and any contact with a subject by telephone or other means that provides significant clinical information will also be documented in the progress notes as described above.  In this clinical trial, study 
specific  CRFs  may serve as source documents.  
 
For transmission to the Sponsor, information from the study progress notes and other source documents will be 
promptly transcribed to study specific  CRF to the EDC with the CRF attached for remote monitoring of the data.  
Transcription of study data onto study specific CRFs and entry into the EDC  should be completed within  3 days of 
the study visit.  
 
Copies of the electronic CRF (eCRF) serving  as source documents must be maintained for each participant enrolled in 
the study. Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the source documents 
or the discrepancies should be explained and captured in a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official 
electronic study record. 
 
Any changes to information in the study progress notes, other source documents, and CRFs  will be initialed and 
dated in ink on the day the change is made by a site study staff member authorized to make the change. Changes 
will be made by striking a single line through erroneous data, and clearly entering the correct data. If the reason for 
the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation by the 
investigator and/or delegated staff.

15.2 AMENDMENT POLICY 
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from the Sponsor and subsequent approval by the IRB, except if the deviation from the protocol is necessary to protect the life and physical 
well-being of a subjec t in an emergency. Such protocol deviations must be reported to the Sponsor and the reviewing 
IRB as soon as possible, but no later than five working days after the emergency occurred.  
 
 Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change  or a change for specific study center(s), must 
be handled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment to the protocol that appears indicated as the study progresses will be fully discussed by the investigator(s) and the Sponsor. If agreement is reached regardi ng the need 
for an amendment, the Sponsor will write it. The written amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB identified with this responsibility. Except for “administrative amendments”, investigators must await IRB approval 
of protocol amend ments before implementing the change(s). Administrative amendments are defined to have no 
effect on the validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved protocol, or the relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied  upon to approve the protocol; the scientific soundness of the 
investigational plan or protocol; and the right, safety or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation.  
When, in judgment of the chairman of the IRB, the investigators and/or th e Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol 
substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written 
Informed Consent Form will require similar modification. In such cases, repeat informed consen t will be obtained 
from subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.  
16. CONFLICT  OF INTEREST  POLICY  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence is critical. Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of 
persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and 
managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed 
in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the trial. The study leadership has established policies and proced ures 
for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish a mech anism for the managemen t of all

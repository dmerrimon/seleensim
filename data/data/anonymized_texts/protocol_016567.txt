 I. Device Description  
BU-CAD developed  by TaiHao Medical Inc. is a software system designed to assist users in 
analyzing breast ultrasound images including identification of regions suspicious for breast 
cancer and assessment of their malignancy. The following figure  shows the architecture cha rt 
of BU -CAD which consists of a Viewer, a Lesion Identification Module, and a Lesion Analysis 
Module.  
 
Architecture chart of BU -CAD  
The Viewer is able to load breast ultrasound and mammography images (FDA -cleared full -
field digital mammography only) from  local storage or a picture archiving and communication 
system (PACS) for review. The Viewer also includes tools that allow users to measure lesion 
size and adjust the image (such as window level and window width adjustment). Additionally, 
the report may b e saved in local storage or uploaded to PACS. BU -CAD also supports 
exporting CAD results to third -party reporting software to facilitate the reporting process.  
The Lesion Identification Module identifies regions of interest (automated ROIs) of a single 
suspicious soft tissue lesion in up to two orthogonal views of breast ultrasound images for 
assisting users in detecting soft tissue lesions. Additionally, the Lesion Identification Module 
generates an ROI and a lesion contour on each breast ultrasound image.  The lesion contour on 
each image will be automatically delineated by the given ROI. The Lesion Analysis Module 
analyzes given ROIs of a breast lesion on ultrasound images, and generates a score of lesion 
characteristics (SLC) in terms of malignancy or ben ignity of a lesion, BI -RADS category, and 
BI-RADS descriptors  (with limitations as described in the User Manual)  for the concurrent 
read. The users are able to replace the automated ROIs with re -delineated rectangular ROIs for 

3 
 analysis by Lesion Analysis Module. Only the last analysis results will be displayed on the user 
interface and are modifiable by the user. Note that the SLC is analyze d based on the rectangular 
ROIs, unless the user re -delineates the ROIs, the SLC will not be changed.  
In clinical practice, after opening multi -modality digital images including ultrasound and 
mammography on the Viewer, the users may identify and analyze l esions with the assistance 
of the Lesion Identification Module and Lesion Analysis Module on the breast ultrasound 
images. Finally, the user confirms the diagnostic results (output from Lesion Analysis Module 
or modified by the user) shown on the user inte rface and saves them to the report.

II. Indications for Use  
BU-CAD is a software application indicated to assist trained interpreting physicians in 
analyzing the breast ultrasound images of patients with soft tissue breast lesions suspicious for 
breast cancer who are being referred for further diagnostic ultrasound  examination.  
Output of the device includes regions of interest (ROIs) and lesion contours placed on breast 
ultrasound images assisting physicians to identify suspicious soft tissue lesions from up to two 
orthogonal views of a single lesion, and region -based analysis of lesion malignancy upon the 
physician’s query. The region -based analysis indicates the score of lesion characteristics (SLC), 
and corresponding BI -RADS categories in user -selected ROIs or ROIs automatically identified 
by the software. In addi tion, BU -CAD also automatically classifies lesion shape, orientation, 
margin, echo pattern, and posterior features according to BI -RADS descriptors.  
BU-CAD may also be used as an image viewer of multi -modality digital images, including 
ultrasound and mamm ography. The software includes tools that allow users to adjust, measure 
and document images, and output into a structured report (SR).  
Patient management decisions should not be made solely on the basis of analysis by BU -CAD.  
Limitations: BU -CAD is not to be used on sites of post -surgical excision, or images with 
Doppler, elastography, or other overlays present in them. BU -CAD is not intended for the 
4 
 primary interpretation of digital mammography images. BU -CAD is not intended f or use on 
mobile devices.  
III. Clinical Performance Data  
◆ Summary of the Reader Study  
The performance of physicians without and with the aid of BU -CAD decision support in 
interpreting breast ultrasound images was compared by using a fully crossed multi -reader 
multi-case receiver operating characteristic (MRMC -ROC) retrospective study (also known as 
Obuchowski -Rockette Dorfman -Berbaum -Metz MRMC -ROC or OR -DBM MRMC -ROC).  
The study consisted of 628 cases, of which 456 cases (189 malignant and 267 benign) were 
collec ted from the United States and 172 cases (65 malignant and 107 benign) were collected

Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup of reader specialty (with and without MQSA certification), with and without breast 
image fellowship training, ultrasound systems (GE, Acuson, Philips, and Canon/Toshiba), 
benign types (pathology proof benign and two -year follow -up benign), cancer types (DCIS, 
IDC, ILC, and others), lesion sizes (less than 1 cm, between 1 cm and 2 cm, and larger than 2 
cm), lesion locations (center and not in center), ages (≤ 50 years, > 50 years, ≤ 55 years, and 
>55 years), and source of cases (U.S. and Taiwan) were performed. Except for the subgroup of 
Acuson ultrasound system,  where the sample size was relatively low,  the readers  aided by the 
BU-CAD achieved higher performance than unaided reading in the other subgroups.  
Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of this clinical study is to compare that the user’s performance 
(sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV) between the unaided and aided readings. Sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV, and NPV produced from the aided arm were higher than unaided. The 
specificity, unadjusted PPV, and unadjusted NPV differed significantly from zero between the 
aided and unaided sessions.

Although the specificity in the aided scenario is 36.11%, t he following confusion table 
summarizes the event count from a false -positive (FP) unaided to a true -negative (TN) when 
aided by BU -CAD or a reverse for all 374 benign cases. A total of 79 0 FP event s unaided were 
changed to TN event s aided  by BU -CAD for al l 16 readers , and a total of 52 3 TN event s 
unaided  were changed to FP event s aided  by BU -CAD for all 16 readers . The overall benefit 
7 
 was +267  events  and shows  that BU-CAD is able to assist  the majority of  readers in reduc ing 
false positive s even for dataset s where  readers have a low specificity performance in the 
unaided scenario .

In addition, BU-CAD software  was found to significantly decrease readers’ interpretation times 
(by ~40%) which w as shown in analyses including and excluding outliers.  Statistical analyses 
also indicated  that BU -CAD improved readers’ determination of BI -RADS descriptors ( Shape, 
Orientation,  Margin, Echo Pattern,  and Posterior Features) , where at least one or more 
subcategories for each descriptor demonstrated improved aided read performance, with 
limitations described in the User Manual .

Lesion Identification Module (CADe) Performance  
A total of 59 benign cases (including 11 of the 20 missing cases) and 18 malignant cases 
(including 9 of the 20 missing cases) did not meet the objective performance criteria ( automated 
ROI center must be within ground truth  ROI with at least 50% overlap  in ROI area ). The 
accuracy of the lesion identification algorithm was 9 3.24% (1062 /1139 ). For the LROC 
analysis, 18 malignant cases were penalized due to wrong location or undet ected by BU -CAD.  
Comparison between Standalone and Unaided Reading Performance  
The standalone performance of BU -CAD was measured in AUC_LROC on the 628 reader 
study cases and the standalone study cases (combined the 628 reader study cases and 511 
extended cases), a total of 1,139 cases (497 malignant and 642 benign). Table  below shows the 
standalone AUC_LROCs in both datasets are higher than that of unaided reading performance.

Summary of Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup of the different ultrasound systems (GE, Siemens, Canon/Toshiba, Philips, 
Supersonic, and others), benign types (pathology proof benign and two -year follow -up benign), 
cancer types (DCIS, IDC, ILC, and others), lesion size (less than 1 cm, between 1 cm and 2 
cm, and larger than 2cm), Lesion Locations (center and not in center), view type (two view vs. 
single view), ages ( ≤ 50 years, > 50 years, ≤ 55 years, and >55 years ), and sources of cases 
(North America, Europe, and Taiwan ) were performed. The performance of distinguish ing 
between benign and malignant  in Siemens ultrasound system, DCIS and ILC cancer type, c ases 
where the lesion  is not in the center, two -orthogonal views, and source of North America and 
Europe achieved a cceptable discrimination  (AUC_LROC fr om 0.7 to 0.8). The remaining 
subgroups achieved e xcellent  (AUC_LROC from 0.8 to 0.9) or outstanding (AUC_LROC > 
0.9) discrimination.  
 
Sensitivity , Specificity , PPV, and NPV  
The standalone performances of sensitivity and specificity were assessed by using the 1,139 
cases and summarized in Table 9. Results show the standalone sensitivity and specificity were 
88.53% and 57.94%. In addition, the adjusted PPV of U.S. and Taiwan were 1.28% and 4.74% 
respectively, the adjusted NPV of U.S. and Taiwan were 99 .83% and 99.67% respectively.  
Because both the prevalence rates of U.S. and Taiwan are relatively low, the adjusted PPVs 
were relatively low and the adjusted NPVs were relatively high. However, the standalone PPVs 
in U.S. and Taiwan were higher than those of unaided and aided scenarios.

The following table showed the calculated sensitivity and specificity using each BI -RADS 
category as  the threshold. Since the clinical decision threshold for cancer vs. non -cancer is BI -
RADS 3 vs BIRADS 4a and the BI -RADS fifth edition concluded that patients with category 
≥ 4a lesions are recommended to undergo biopsy, the analysis of sensitivity and specificity are 
still based on BI -RADS 4a as the cutoff point (i.e., a BI -RADS category of 4a or higher defines 
a positive call for cancer diagnosis).

Robustness of the Lesion Analysis Module (CADx)  
To evaluate the robustness of the CADx algorithm (Lesion Analysis Module) when 
different  rectangular  ROIs are drawn around the same lesion  on a given  single -view  image or 
two-view images, two reproducibility experiments of the same lesion cropped by 
different  rectangular  ROIs were conducted. In  the first  reproducibility experiment, e ach corner 
point of  an ROI was  shifted by randomly changing  the horizontal and  vertical dimensions up 
to 20%  respectively from the ground truth  ROI defined by the expert panel.  The experiment 
was repeated 20 times  with all 1139 test cases (the  original dat aset was 628 cases and the 
11 
 extended dataset was 511 cases). The results show that randomly enlarging the width 
and height of the ROIs did not affect the performance of the BU -CAD CADx algorithm (Lesion 
Analysis Module). The AUC remained stabl e between 0.84 0 and 0.8 46. 
In the second reproducibility experiment, each corner point of ground truth ROI was altered by 
systematically shrinking the horizontal and vertical dimensions respectively from 1% to 30%. 
The experiment was conducted  with all 1139 cases. The n ew ROIs and their corresponding 
images were then processed by the BU -CAD CADx algorithm  (Lesion Analysis Module) to 
produce analysis outputs.  The results show that  as long as the shrinking percentage of the width 
and height of the ROIs is within 16%, the A UC r emained above 0.8 . 
IV. Conclusions  
The aided AUCs of the location -specific ROC for BU -CAD were superior to that of the un -
aided reads for the diagnosis of breast ultrasound images.  
BU-CAD decision support device was found to significantly decrease readers ’ interpretation 
times (by ~40%) which were shown in both analyses of including and excluding outliers.  
Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV produced from the aided arm were higher than unaided. 
The specificity, PPV, and NPV differed significantly from zero between the aided and unaided 
sessions.   
Statistical analyses also indicated that BU -CAD improved readers’ determination of BI -RADS 
descriptors (shape, orientation, margin, echo pattern, and posterior features). The Orientation 
of the BI -RADS descrip tor in both unaided and aided reading was in substantial agreement 
with ground truth. The Shape and Orientation rated by readers who have received breast image 
fellowship training in the aided scenario were in substantial agreement with ground truth.

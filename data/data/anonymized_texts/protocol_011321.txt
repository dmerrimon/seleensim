This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government 
regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
1.1 Background 
Primary scarring alopecias (PSAs) are poorly understood dermatologic disorders that 
result in permanent hair loss (1). PSAs are classified based on the type of inflammatory 
infiltrate recognized histologically on biopsy: lymphocytic, neutrophilic, or mixed .  As 
p
ainful hair loss disorders, scarring alopecias have yet to be studied in a manner that 
explores the disease burden on the individual and how to more effectively manage 
debilitating symptoms.  Most of the scarring alopecias involve a painful course, with 
individuals reporting scalp pain, burning, itching, or tingling/crawling sensations that can 
ultimately impact physical and psychological health (1). It is well-documented that 
individuals with chronic pain are more susceptible to depression and other mood 
disorders (2). Thus, a better understandin g of the pain process in scarring alopecia 
would benefit patients and health care providers tremendously as scientists research to 
discover the origin and pathogenesis of these inflammatory and irreversible conditions. 
 
CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) has been proposed to play a role in pain 
transmission and inflammation (3, 4).  While originally found to be elevated in migraines, 
two patients with lichen planopilaris (LPP) at the University of Minnesota were found to 
h
ave elevated amounts of CGRP via immunohistochemical staining and confocal 
microscopic examination of scalp biopsy specimens . Seven patients, three with frontal 
fi
brosing alopecia and four with LPP, were also found to have decreased expression of 
epidermal nerves as well as CRGP expression.  This suggests that neurogenic 
inflammation may contribute to the disease state of scarring alopecia. Investigating this 
relationship between CGRP and scalp symptoms such as pain in the setting of scarring 
alopecia may lead to a long awaited breakthrough in disease pathogenesis and 
management. Agents that reduce the release of neuropeptides, such as gabapentin, 
may serve as potential treatment in scarring alopecia. Recent data from pilot 
experiments at the University of Minnesota using normal human tissue stimulated by 
gabapentin reflected a reduction in CGRP compared to levels of CGRP in control 
unstimulated tissue, indicating that CGRP may realistically be an appropriate 
therapeutic target in scarring alopecia. 
 
1.2 Investigational Agent 
Gabapentin is a GABA analogue originally introduced in 1994 for the treatment of 
epilepsy by Warner-Lambert (today Pfizer). It is currently widely used to relieve pain, 
especially neuropathic pain syndromes associated with diabetic neuropathy, v ulvodynia, 
postherpetic neuralgia and other allodynia (5, 6) . While gabapentin ’s mechanism of 
action is not completely understood, it is thought to work through its effects on voltage-
gated calcium ion channels in the central nervous system once it crosses the blood-
b
rain barrier (7). Its neuromodulatory effects also impact the peripheral nervous system.

Currently, the management of symptomatic scarring alopecia includes intralesional 
triamcinolone injections alone or with topical steroid solutions, minoxidil, oral antibiotics, 
hydroxychloroquine or immunosuppressive medications such as prednisone.  Since the 
cause of scarring alopecia is unknown, the various modes of treatment have focused on 
targeting the inflammation associated with the disease process that is reflected 
histologically. No one treatment has been found successful in all conditions nor is there 
a cure. Individuals with end-stage, non-symptomatic disease may be candidates for hair 
transplantation.   
 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date 
There has been no study of topical neurogenic agents, such as gabapentin, to treat 
scarring alopecia. However topical gabapentin has been safely used in other conditions 
associated with chronic pain, burning, irritation, itch, or tingling, such as vulvodynia (5).  
 
Interestingly, gabapentin has been shown to be effective against migraine headaches, a 
condition associated with high levels of CGRP (6).  Gabapentin has also been shown to 
be effective in managing neuropathic pain.  This evidence suggests that gabapentin 
could be effective in the treatment of scarring alopecia, especially if increased CGRP is 
contributing to symptomatology. 
 
This study will serve as a pilot study to determine the efficacy and safety of topical 
gabape ntin in the treatment of symptomatic scarring alopecia.   In this study, 10 subjects 
with symptomatic lymphocytic-type scarring alopecia will be recruited and treated with 
topical gabapentin.  Disease burden will be evaluated before and after 12 weeks of 
treatment through reporting of subjective symptomatology via surveys/questionnaire , 
neurometer study, clinical assessment, and biopsies measuring levels of CGRP before 
and after treatment.  
 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
The maximum daily dose of topical gabapentin will be 2 mL daily. The drug will be 
administered topically by the subject to symptomatic affected areas of intact skin two 
times daily for 12 weeks. Subjects will be seen in follow up on Week 8 and Week 12 
(Visits 4 and 5). 
 
Gabapentin will be compounded into a 6% solution based on a preparation method 
described by Boardman et al. (5) and approved by Investigation al Drug Services (IDS) 
Pharmacy, University of Minnesota. IDS will prepare and dispense the drug .   
 
F
rom published data in which gabapentin was used in a cohort group with nerve-related 
symptoms from localized or generalized vulvodynia, the most frequently reported 
adverse effect was irritation at the site of application, which led to termination of use 
(8%). Common adverse effects of oral gabapentin, including dizziness, somnolence, 
and peripheral edema, were not reported by any of the patients studied with vulvodynia. 
In this pilot study for scarring alopecia, the maximum daily dose will not exceed 2 mL of 
topical gabapentin 6% solution to affected scalp surface.

Based on its ha lf-life of 8 hours, gabapentin will be administered two times a day during 
waking hours and the dose will not exceed the amount of a topical agent used on 
average to treat the entire scalp in everyday clinical practice (60 ml per month). 
 
Subjects may directly benefit from analysis of nerve function, CGRP neuropeptide, and 
treatment with gabapentin, resulting in improvement of their symtoms that may prevent 
further hair loss and even possible hair growth. This analysis will also help us better 
understand the disease process in scarring alopecia to further improve management of 
the condition.   
 
2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective : To assess the role of neurogenic inflammation associated with 
CGRP expression in scarring alopecia   
 
Secondary Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of topical 6% gabapentin in 
subjects with symptomatic scarring alopecia.  
 
3 Study Design  
 
3.1 General Design 
This is a cohort study.  
 
Every subject is expected to schedule 6 visits total to complete the study. The total 
duration of the study for each volunteer is expected to be approximately 14 weeks. 
 
Prior to gabapentin treatment, there is one visit to screen individuals for participation in 
the study and to obtain consent. After consent is signed, this visit will also include 
obtaining history from the subject, clinical evaluation, survey completion, neurometer 
study, photography, and scalp biopsies. At this initial visit, a total of four 4-mm skin 
biopsies will be collected . Two biopsies will be collected from affected, symptomatic 
scalp, and two skin biopsies will be collected from clinically unaffected scalp. Routine 
histology, confocal microscopy examination, and, if indicated, ELISA CGRP level 
analysis will be performed on the biopsy specimens. Subjects will start topical 6% 
gabapentin treatment on Visit 2 (Day 0).  Four remaining visits will be scheduled to 
follow subjects after the start of topical 6% gabapentin treatment.  Visits 3, 4 and 5 will 
occur 4 , 8 and 1 2 weeks respective ly after treatment with gabapentin is started . These 
visits will include labwork to check gabapentin blood levels. During Visit 5 , the subject 
will also be reassessed through clinical evaluation, completion of surveys, neurometer 
study , photography, and fou r 4-mm scalp biopsies. Visit 6 will be a follow-up visit two 
weeks after completion of treatment for suture removal and clinical evaluation of the 
subject.

3.2 Primary Study Endpoints 
(1) To assess the role of neurogenic inflammation in symptomatic scarring alopecia and 
(2) assess the efficacy of topical 6% gabapentin in the management of symptomatic 
scarring alopecia patients. Subjects’ disease burden will be assessed by clinical exam, 
qualitatively with surveys and neurometer study, and skin biopsies to confirm disease 
diagnosis, assess disease inflammation, and measure CGRP levels. Subjects will begin 
topical 6% gabapentin treatment for 12 weeks starting at Visit 2. They will be followed 
up every 4 weeks during treatment and will be reassessed at week 12 (visit 5) with 
clinical exam, qualitatively with surveys and neurometer study, and final biopsies to 
evaluate the impact of gabapentin on the disease and CGRP levels. The surveys to be 
filled out by the subjects include the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) , Short Form 
(36) Health Survey (SF-36) , Visual Analog Scale for Pain, and Visual Analog Scale for 
Itch.

If a subject withdraws consent to participate in the study, attempts will be made to 
obtain permission to record data up to the protocol-described end of subject follow- up 
period. 
 
Three phone calls one week apart one from another will be made to the subjects lost to 
follow-up to record data up to the protocol-described end of subject follow-up period. 
 
5 Study Drug  
 
5.1 Description 
Gabapentin is a GABA analogue anticonvulsant also used to treat neuropathic pain. It is 
thought to target voltage-gated calcium ion channels at pre- and post-synaptic 
m
embranes of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system modulating the 
release of neurotransmitters.  
 
Gabapentin is normally available in solid (powder) form and must be compounded into a 
topical solution. Based on published data of effective topical gabapentin preparation in 
vulvodynia and experience preparing topical gabapentin for use in patients with pain , 
IDS Pharmacy of University of Minnesota will compound the gabapentin into the 
solution for topical use. Once prepared, IDS will also be responsible for dispensing the 
solution of 6% gabapentin in an appropriate drug container to be given to subjects. 
Each subject participating in the study will receive enough gabapentin solution for use 
over four weeks, approximately a maximum of 2 mL a day; 60 mL for 4 weeks. After 4 
weeks of treatment (Visit 4) and 8 weeks of treatment (Visit 5) the subject will return for 
follow up with the prescribed gabapentin container and will be given a new dispensed 
bottle of the solution for use during the next four weeks.    
 
Treatment Regimen 
Qualified subjects will be educated by the research coordinator on how to properly apply 
the gabapentin 6% solution two times daily onto intact skin of affected symptomatic 
scalp areas.  The minimum and the maximum size of the scalp areas to be treated will 
be determined for each subject respectively, based on their disease pattern assessed 
during Visit 2.   Treated sites will be initially recorded and should be treated for the entire 
12 weeks unless the skin is adversely affected by the topical gabapentin.

other neuromodulatory agents or steroids are used during the treatment period. 
Recommended application will be in morning and evening at bedtime. The solution 
should be applied after hair washing if this coincides with time for application.   
 
5.2 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
All participants will receive treatment with topical 6% gabapentin. The study design does 
not include a control group, therefore, randomization of participants will not occur.   
 
5.3 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
IDS will be responsible for the preparation and dispensing of gabapentin 6% solution to 
the principal investigators or clinical research coordinator (study team) . The clinical 
r
esearch coordinator will provide subjects with the solution to administer two times daily 
a
fter educating them on how to apply the drug. The gabapentin solution should be 
stored at room temperature (20° to 25°C)/(68° to 77°F) while always properly sealed 
and away from light and moisture. The study team will provide the subjects with a fo ur 
week supply of solution at a time. Subjects will contact investigators or coordinator if 
they need more solution and will be asked to do so promptly if low on solution to avoid 
gaps in treatment.   
 
5.4 Subject Compliance Monitoring 
Subject participants will be informed that they will be asked to stop taking any 
medications/treatments for their scarring alopecia while participating in this study.  This 
statement will be also written in the consent form that subjects will be asked to read, 
understand and sign prior participating in the study.  
  
5.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Subjects will be asked detailed information regarding their medical and medication 
history for general health issues and specific focused questions regarding their 
symptomatic scarring alopecia .  
 
Subjects will not be allowed to use any medicines/therapies other than the gabapentin 
6% solution on the scalp for their symptomatic scarring alopecia. 
 
5.6 Packaging 
The gabapentin 6% solution will be prepared through a compounding method by IDS 
Pharmacy and will be dispensed in red sealed containers with 60 mL of solution.   
 
5.7 Blinding of Study Drug 
This is not a blinded study.

IDS will dispense the drug-filled container to the investigators or coordinators. Once 
qualified to begin treatment, each subject will receive one container of 60 mL of 
gabapentin 6% solution from the clinical coordinator.  Regular study drug reconciliation 
will be performed to document drug assigned . During follow-up visits, drug consumed 
and drug remaining will be recorded. This reconciliation will be logged on the drug 
reconciliation form, and signed and dated by the study team. 
 
5.8.3  Return or Destruction of S tudy Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug dispensed, drug 
consumed, and drug remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the drug 
reconciliation form, signed and dated. Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, 
resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused study drug. Drug 
destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.

7 Statistical Plan  
 
7.1 Sample Size Determination 
This is a pilot study with the plan to enroll 10 subjects. The reasoning for sample size 
selection is to proceed with preliminary studies in a small group. All subjects will be 
selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
 
7.2 Statistical Methods 
An intent- to-treat analysis will be performed in all subjects for symptoms and sign 
scores comparing the last treatment visit to baseline. A combination of methods will be 
included for analysis. Descriptive statistics including either numerically or graphical 
representations to summarize the data will be used. 
 
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis 
Data collected from all subjects will be included for the analysis. Data collection of 
withdrawn subjects will be collected up to the point of withdrawal. This data will still be 
included in the pool-data of the study for further analysis. 
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
 
8.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries 
should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospital stay 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
  Page 14 
CONFIDENTIAL 
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, 
drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization, or 
intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be 
considered serious.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious will be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as 
the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment 
follow-up.  For this study, the study treatment follow-up is defined as 14 weeks following 
the start of administration of study treatment (Day 0).   
 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting 
condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as 
an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Gabapentin blood levels will be monitored to ensure gabapentin toxicity does not occur.  
If gabapentin levels reach or exceed 16 ug/mL, gabapentin treatment will be interrupted.  
Abnormal gabapentin levels will be recorded as an adverse event and followed by the 
investigator until the event has resolved. 
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization will be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery will be documented as 
an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
  Page 15 
CONFIDENTIAL 
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sponsor  
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are 
reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
p
rocedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy 
measurement for the study.  
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of 
th
e study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital 
admissions as judged by the clinical investigator. 
 
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
At each contact with the subject, the investigators will seek information on adverse 
events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all 
adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the 
appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the 
source document, though will be grouped under one diagnosis. 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical 
course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to 
determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation will be recorded and reported immediately. 
 
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
 
8.3.1  Study S ponsor Notification by Investigator  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by the investigator within 24 
hours. The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.  
Report serious adverse events by phone and facsimile to: 
 
 Maria K. Hordinsky, MD     
 Cell: 612-710-5507

 Study Center  
 Subject number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset  
 Current st atus  Whether study treatment was 
discontinued  
 The reason why the event is 
classified as serious  
 Investigator assessment of the 
association between the event and 
study treatment  
 
Within the following 48 hours, the investigator will provide further information on the 
serious adverse event in the form of a written narrative. This should include a copy of 
the completed Serious Adverse Event form, and any other diagnostic information that 
will assist the understanding of the event. Significant new information on ongoing 
serious adverse events will be provided promptly to the principal investigator, Maria K. 
Hordinsky, and Department of Dermatology. 
 
8.3.2  IRB Notification by Investigator  
Reports of all serious adverse events (including follow-up information) will be submitted 
to the IRB within 10 working days if it falls under the UPIRTSO guidelines.  Copies of 
each report and documentation of IRB notification and receipt will be kept in the Clinical 
Investigator’s binder. 
 
8.3.3  FDA Notification by Sponsor 
The study sponsor shall notify the FDA by telephone or by facsimile transmission of any 
unexpected fatal or life-threatening experience associated with the use of the drug as 
soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the investigator’s original 
receipt of the information. 
 
If a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit 
the criteria for reporting, the investigators will submit the adverse event in a written 
report to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days from the time 
the determination is made. 
 
8.4 Unblinding Procedures 
This is not a blinded study. 
 
8.5 Stopping Rules  
Individual subjects will be administering topical gabapentin independently without 
supervision by study team.  Subjects are to terminate treatment if any new adverse 
symptoms different from before treatment occur or worsen and contact the study team 
immediately.  Individual subjects will also be asked to terminate treatment if their 
gabapentin blood levels are >16 ug/mL. 
 
8.6 Medical Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at 
his/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate 
reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and

9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
 
9.1 Confidentiality 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject 
of the following:  
 
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this 
study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, 
by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use 
PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. 
that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
 
9.2 Source Documents/Case Report Forms

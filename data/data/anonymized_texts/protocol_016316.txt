 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 6.0 RATIONALE  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to address the following requests from the FDA:  
 To include additional hepatitis viral load testing in patients who had detectable 
hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) viral load at Screening,  
 To add myocarditis  and myositis/ rhabodmyol ysis as potential immune -related 
adverse events and provide guidelines for their treatment and study drug 
management,  
 To add serum creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase cardiac muscle isoenzyme 
(CK-MB) monitoring due to 2 cases of myositis reported with tislelizumab, and  
 To add additional ophthalm ologic evaluation time points.  
 
Additional changes  made in the amendment are noted below.   Minor editorial changes were 
also made throughout the protocol.  
Applicable Sections  Description of Revision  
Change: Changed BGB -A317 to the compound’s INN name, tislelizumab, throughout the 
document (did not change the study number or protocol name).  
Reason:  INN name for BGB -A317 is available  
Change: Included add itional hepatitis viral load testing every 4 cycles throughout the study for 
patients who had detectable hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) viral load at Screening, and 
how to manage subjects with HCC who test positive for HBV or HCV.  
Reason: Based on a request from the FDA, in order to reduce the risk of significant hepatic toxicity 
in patients with active or prior HBV infection, and for consistency across protocols.  
Section 5.1:  
Table 5 + footnote 17,  
Table 7 + footnote 16,  
Table 8 + footnote 16,  
Table 9 + footnote 16,  
Table 11 + footnote 17  
 
Section 8.2.2  
 
Section 11.3.10  
 
Appendix 3   In Section 8.2.2, revised heading to “Physical Examination, 
Ophthalmologic Examination and, Vital Signs , and Hepatitis B and C 
testing  
 In Section 8.2.2, and in Section 5.1 footnotes for Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 
pertaining to hepatitis B and C assessment, added the following text:  
Subjects enrolled in the study who had detectable HBV DNA or HCV 
RNA at Screening should be tested for HBV or HCV viral load, 
respectively , every 4 cycles (± 7 days) throughout the study, eg 
Screening, Cycle 5, Cycle 9, and so on (and whenever clinically 
indicated). For subjects who already received 4 or more doses of study 
drug, the viral load test should be repeated at the subject’s next v isit and 
every 4 cycles according to the schedule from first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1), 
and whenever clinically indicated. HCC subjects who test positive for 
HCV will not be discontinued. HCC subjects who test positive for HBV 
should be treated as per local gui delines at the investigator’s discretion.  
 In Section 5.1, study assessment tables for each phase/part of the study 
(Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11), separated HIV assessment from hepatitis B and 
C assessment for clarity.  For hepatitis B and C assessment, in addition to 
the “x” at Screening, added “x (Cycle 5 and every 4 cycles)” to each table.

 Applicable Sections  Description of Revision  
 Added Section 11.3.10 Hepatitis B and C, to add the assessment as a safety 
analysis.  
 In Appendix 3, for each separate study phase, added collection of 3 -5 mL 
blood for hepatitis B and C analysis on Cycle 5 Day 1 (and every 4 cycles 
thereafter).  
Change: Clarified the timing of ophthalmologic examinations after Cycle 3 (for Q2W patients)/End 
of Week 9 (for Q3W patients) as shown below, including subjects who may not have previously had 
an assessment after Cycle 3/Week 9, respectively. Additionally, all references to “eyesight” as part 
of an ophthalmologic exam were changed to “ey esight/visual acuity”.  
Reason: Changes to ophthalmologic examination were made to ensure all subjects have an 
assessment every 15 -16 weeks throughout the study.  Reference to visual acuity was specifically 
requested by the FDA to ensure there is no confusio n. 
Section 5.1:

Table 7 footnote 23, 
Table 8  footnote 23, 
Table 9 footnote 23, 
Table 11 footnote 26 
 
Section 8.2.2   In Section 8.2.2 (first sentence of paragraph 3), and in footnotes for 
Tables  5, 7, 8, 9, 11 (Phases 1a and 1b) pertaining to ophthalmological 
examinations (first sentence), revised the text as follows:  
Ophthalmological examinations (such as eyesight/ visual acuity , 
fundoscopy, slit lamp microscopy, and optical coherence tomography [or 
equivalent diagnostic test]) …  
 In Section 8.2.2, revised last sentence of paragraph 3 as follows:  
Subjects dosed on a Q2W schedule will then undergo ophthalmologic 
examinations by an appropriate specialist on Cycle 1 Day 15 
(± 7 days) (Phase 1 A Part 1 only), Cycle 3 Day 1 (± 7 days), and 
thereafter every 4 cycles/16 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment. 
Subjects dosed on a Q3W schedule will undergo an ophthalmologic 
examination by an appropriate specialist at the end of Week 9 
(± 7 days), and thereafter every 5 cycles/15 weeks (± 7 days) during 
study treatment.  Patients Subjects in all groups  will undergo repeat 
assessments by an appropriate specialist approximately every 15 weeks 
(± 7 days) during study treatment and a final assessment <30 days after 
the last dose of study treatment . For those subjects who have already 
received 2 or 3 more doses of study drug, respectively, the 
examination should be repeated at the subject’s next visit and then 
approximately either every 4 cycles/16 weeks (± 7 days) for subjects 
dosed on a Q2W schedu le or every 5 cycles/15 weeks (± 7 days) for 
subjects dosed on a Q3W schedule, according to the schedule from 
first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1).  
 In Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, 1 1, footnotes  pertaining to schedule of 
ophthalmological examinations ( second sentence), revised  sentences in 
accordance with the edits made to Section 8.2.2, above.  
Change: Revised the window for the Safety Follow -up visit from 30 ± 7 days to 30 ± 3 days.     
Reason:  To increase clarity and consistency throughout the protocol.   
Section 5.1  
Table s 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 
(including footnote 2 
in each table)   In each table, in the header column “Safety Follow -up”, the “Days” box 
was changed as follows: “30 ± 73 Days after last dose”.   
 Table 2 footnote in each table was similarly revised to state:  “2.  The 
mandatory Safety Follow -Up visit should be conducted 30 days (± 73 days)

 Applicable Sections  Description of Revision  
 after the last dose of study therapy or before the initiation of a new 
treatment, whichever comes first. ” 
Section 10.5  Changed the first sentence as follows: Subjects will be assessed  for AEs and 
SAEs beginning immediately after signing the informed consent form and 
continuing through to follow up which is 30 ±  7 3 days of last dose of 
investigational drug.   
Change:  For subjects who have confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease 
after 2 years and want to take a break in treatment without discontinuing, the frequency of 
assessments and procedures was changed from once every cycle to once every 1 2 weeks.  
Reason: To reduce the number of subject visits while on break, aligning the timing of assessments 
and procedures with the schedule for radiographic imaging.  
Section 5.2.5.1   Modified last bullet point as follows:  
If subjects have confirmed CR, PR, or SD after 2 years of tislelizumab, 
the treatment can be stopped if the subject agrees. . . The study 
assessment and procedures schedule will remain the same.  In such a 
case, the study assessments and procedures will be  performed every 
12 weeks (in conjunction with repeat radiographic imaging, as 
described in Sectio n 8.5) rather than every cycle.  If a subject has 
evidence of PD within 1 year of treatment interruption, the Investigator 
can consider restarting tislelizumab  therapy after discussion with the 
Sponsor, contingent on the continued availability of tislelizumab drug 
product.  
Change: Clarified that during Survival Follow -up phase, in addition to survival data, 
immune -related AEs ( irAE s) will be collected through 90 days post -treatment.  Further clarified 
that the irAEs will be assessed by phone contact  at 90 days  rather than via office visit unless  a 
suspected irAE is reported.   
Reason: The AE follow -up period for irAEs is 90 days. Thus, information on irAEs needs to be 
collected during early Survival Follow -up, but does not require an office visit . These edits correct 
the discrepanc ies. 
Section 5.1:  
Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 
(footnote 7 in each 
table) , 
Section 8.4,  
Section 10.5   Clarified the following sentence as follows:  
Telephone contact s with patients should be conducted to assess irAEs 
90 days after the last dose of  tislelizumab , regardless of whether or not 
the subject starts a new anticancer therapy.  If patients report a 
suspected immune -related AE at a telephone follow -up contact, the 
investigator should arrange an unscheduled visit if further 
assessment is indicated.  
Section 8.4  Corrected the last paragraph as follows:  
Following completion of the treatment and safety follow -up periods, all 
subjects will be  followed for survival status. Subjects will have their 
survival status assessed approximately every 3 months ± 2 weeks by 
either a telephone or in -person contact until subject death or termination 
by the Sponsor.  No With the exception of the collection of irAE data 
through 90 days post -treatment  (as described  above ), no other data 
(eg subsequent therapies, performance status etc.) beyond survival will 
be collected during these calls/visits.

 Applicable Sections  Description of Revision  
Change: Clarified that assessment of intensity and causality for each AE must be made at the time 
event is reported.  
Reason: For clarification; and to reduce the number of AEs that are reported by the investigator 
without causality, as such events would automatically be considered Related.  
Section 10.7.1   Corrected the first sentence as follows:  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and 
SAE reported during the study, at the time the event is reported.    
Section 10.7.2   Corrected the first sentence as follows:  
The Investigator is  obligated to assess the relationship between the 
investigational product and the occurrence of each AE or SAE , at the 
time the event is reported .   
Change:  In Section 10.13.3, revised length of follow -up period post -birth for any child delivered to 
a fem ale subject or female partner of a male subject who becomes pregnant while on study . In 
Appendix 12, contraception guidance was revised as shown. Additional edits were made to both 
sections for clarity. A cross -reference to Appendix 12 was added in Inclusi on Criterion #10.  
Reason: For patient safety, for clarification, and to bring guidance in line with other tislelizumab 
protocols.  
Synopsis Key 
Inclusion Criteria,  
Section 5.2.1   In Inclusion Criterion #10b, added a cross -reference to Appendix 12 for 
contraception guidelines and definition of “women of childbearing 
potential”/”not childbearing potential.”  
Section 10.13.3   The last 2 sentences in paragraph 2 was edited as follows:  
 Generally, follow up will be no longer than 15 days  8 weeks  following the 
estimated delivery date.  Any premature termination (spontaneous or 
elective abortion prior to 20 weeks or stillbirth after 20 weeks 
gestational age) of the pregnancy will be reported.  
Appendix 12   Under “Contraception Guidelines”, edited the following bullet points:  
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal 
contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation ( oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal , implants or subcutaneous or 
intramuscular injections ). 
 Combined oral contracep tives (birth control pills) may be used, 
but only if a concurrent barrier method is employed.  
 Vasectomized male partner (with azoospermia demonstrated by a 
post-procedure medical examination of the semen)  
 Under “Definitions of “Women of Childbearing Potent ial,” “Women of No

 Methodology:  
This is a two -stage study consisting of a Phase 1A dose escalation and dose -finding component to establish 
the MTD , if any,  and RP2D(s), followed by a Phase 1B componen t to investigate efficacy in select tumor 
types and  to further evaluate safety and tolerability of tislelizumab  at RP2D(s) .. Archival tumor tissue will be 
collected for purpose of biomarker analysis, although a fresh tumor biopsy at baseline is strongly 
recommended. In the absence of archival tumor tissues, a fresh biopsy of a tumor lesion is required at 
baseline; for these subjects, an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis after two cycles of treatment is 
strongly recommended. Optional biopsy will also be  taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who 
have confirmed disease progression during the study from accessible tumor sites to obtain samples to explore 
resistance mechanism. If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally taken from the same tumor lesion 
as the baseline biopsy. Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor biopsies.  
Mandatory biopsy at baseline and on treatment  are required for some tumor types in the Phase 1B study . 
Subjects will be monitored for safety,  anti-tislelizumab  antibodies and efficacy throughout  the study. 
Radiological assessment of tumor response status should be performed approximately  every 8 weeks or 9 
weeks  depending on dosing schedules in the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter.  
 Phase 1A, Part 1  
The Phase 1A, Part 1  component is a multicenter, open -label, multiple -dose, dose escalation, first -in-human 
study. Four dose levels are planned: 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg, Q2W (once every two weeks) . The study 
will follow a modified 3+3 dose escalation scheme. At least three (3) subjects will be enrolled into each 
cohort. Additional subject(s), up to a maximum of six (6) subjects in total, will be enrolled if more than 
three (3) have been screened and are eligible for the cohort.  The dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment  
will be conducted in the first cycle consisting of 28 days. Dose escalation will continue until identification of 
MTD or 10 mg/kg in the event that a MTD is not identified due to pauc ity of DLTs. Two (2) or more DLT in 
a cohort of three (3) to six (6) subjects is considered to have exceeded MTD.  
Continuous safety evaluation will be performed by the Sponsor , the Coordinating Investigator , and 
Investigators . A Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC) will be established for the determination of dose levels 
to be administered and dose regimen during dose escalation based on the data available from the previous 
dose levels.  
The SMC may decide to evaluate an intermediate, not pre -defined and not pr eviously -studied dose, if 
evaluation of toxicity at such a dose is desired. If this approach is taken, up to 6 new subjects should be 
enrolled at the new intermediate dose.  
 Phase 1A, Part 2  
The Phase 1A, Part 2  component  will evaluate the safety and PK of two dosing schedules Q2W versus Q3W  
(once every three weeks)  at selected doses that have cleared the DLT period without exceeding  MTD ( eg, 2 
mg/kg  or 5 mg/kg, up to 10 mg/kg). Ten to 20  subjects per dose schedule will be enrolled  to evaluate the 
safety , the PK and preliminary efficacy. Tumor types to be enrolled include  but are not limited to  colorectal 
cancer ( CRC ), non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ), bladder cancer, melanoma 
and ovarian cancer . Other cancers that are deemed to be likely to benefit from programmed cell death -1 
(PD-1) inhibition based on high mutational load, preclinical or clinical data from other studies may be 
considered for enrollment subject to discussion with the medical monit or. Q2W and Q3W schedule  cohorts 
for each dose may be evaluated sequentially  or in parallel . 
To adequately monitor safety of subjects enrolled in dosing schedule  expansion,  when at least 6 subjects have 
been treated at a specific dose and schedule and  ≥33% of the subjects experienced a DLT during the first 28 
days in both Q2W and Q3W schedules , study accrual will be held pending data review by the SMC . 
Tislelizumab  will also be withheld in the event of other serious adverse reactions according to pre -specified 
criteria. In the event that a MTD is not identified, RP2D and dosing regimen used in the Phase 1B stage  will 
be determined  by the SMC and the Sponsor  based on the PK, tolerability  and preliminary antitumor activities 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL

 observed in the Phase 1A stage , as well as other available data . Based on the Phase 1A data, more than one 
dose or dosing regimen may be selected to be evaluated in Phase 1B for safety and preliminary efficacy in 
select tumor types.  
 Phase 1A, Part 3 
The Phase 1A, Part 3 component will evaluate the safety and PK of tislelizumab  at flat doses  (ie 200 mg , 
Q3W)  that do not  exceed the exposure of the MTD  as determined in the Phase 1A, Part 1 study .  
Approximately 10 to 20 subjects will be enrolled. Tumors types to be enrolled include but not limited to 
NSCLC, RCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) , bladder cancer, melanoma , gastric, 
oesophageal, Merkel -cell carcinoma and HCC . Other cancers that are deemed to be likely to benefit from 
PD-1 inhibition based on high mutational load, preclinical or clinical data from other studies may be 
considered for enrollment subject to discussion with the medical monitor  in advance .  
The doses selected for the flat dose exploration have been evaluated for DLT and demonstrated as safe in the 
Phase 1A Part 1 study. Nevertheless, to adequately monitor safety of subjects enrolled in flat dose 
exploration, study accrual at a specific dose level will be held pending data review by the SMC  when at least 
6 subjects  have been treated and ≥33% of the subjects experienced a DLT during the first cycle consisting of 
21 days. A planned formal SMC review of safety data will be performed after all subjects  have completed the 
first cycle  of treatment, or withdrew due to any reason (progressive disease  [PD] , adverse event  [AE], or 
death) . 
This part of the Phase 1A study will be conducted  in Australia and/or New Zealand sites only and may be 
conducted in parallel with a Phase 1B study that evaluates a RP2D  selected based on the P hase IA, Part 1 and 
2 data  as described in Section 2.5.4 . 
 Phase 1B  
The Phase 1B stage  is a multicenter, open -label, multiple -dose, multiple -arm, indication  expansion study. 
The various arms of the study will investigate RP2D(s)  to examine the potential efficacy as well as safety  and 
tolerability of tislelizumab  in cancer  patients who failed standard care therap ies. The cancer  indications may 
include:  
Arm 1. Subjects with NSCLC (approximately 50 subjects)  
Arm 2. Subject s with ovarian cancer (approximately 20 subjects)  
Arm 3. Subject s with gastric cancer (approximately 50 subjects)  
Arm 4. Subject s with HCC  (approximately 50 subjects)  
Arm 5. Subject s with HNSCC (approximately 20 subjects)  
Arm 6. Subject s with esophageal carcinoma (approximately 50 subjects)  
Arm 7. Subject s with triple n egative breast cancer ( TNBC ) (approximately 20 subjects)  
Arm 8. Subject s with cholangiocarcinoma (approximately 20 subjects)  
Arm 9. Subject s with RCC, bladder cancer , melanoma , Merkel -cell carcinoma, sarcoma,  
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  (cuSCC) . Or any other 
solid tumors  with  microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) , such 
as CRC or pancreatic cancer  (approximately 50 subjects)  
For Arms 1, 3, 4 and 6, at least 20 subject s each will be enrolled from Taiwan or Korea. Enrollment rates will 
be different for each expansion arm.   Individual arms may be  closed at the discretion of the Sponsor once the 
target number of enrolled subjects  is reached.   Individual arms may also be closed prematurely due to 
difficulty in recruitment at the discretion of the Sponsor.  Subjects will receive tislelizumab  at the RP2D as 
described in Section 2.5.4 . Each treatment cycle will be  21 days in duration. Subjects will continue treatment 
until confirmed disease progression, intolerable toxicity, subject discontinuation/ withdrawal or at the 
discretion of the Investigator in consultation with Sponsor .

 To adequately monitor safety of subject s enrolled in the Phase 1B indication  expansion,  when at least 6 
subjects have been treated and  ≥33% of the subjects experienced a DLT during the first 21 days, study 
accrual will be held pending data review by the SMC.  
Tumor response will be assessed by Investigator s based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version  (v) 1.1.  
For immune therapies such as tislelizumab , pseudo -progression may occur due to immune cell infiltration 
and other mechanisms as manifested by apparent increase of existing tumor masses or appearance of new 
tumor lesions  (Wolchok et al, 2009 ). Thus for PD suspected by the Investigator  as pseudo -progression, 
treatment may continue until confirmation of   PD with repeat imagin g at least 4 weeks later or at the next 
regularly scheduled imaging time point , but not to exceed 12 weeks from the initial documentation  of PD . 
But the patient must be re -consented and the following criteria must be met in order to continue the treatment  
after initial PD :  
a. Absence of clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including w orsening laboratory values).  
b. Stable Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status.  
c. Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites ( eg cord 
compression) that necessitates urgent alternative medical intervention.   
Planned number of subjects:  Phase 1A stage: Approximately 120 subjects  for the dose escalation , 
dosing schedule  expansion  and flat dos e exploration . 
Phase 1B stage: Approximately 330 subjects  for indication expansion . 
One or more arms may be closed early in the event of  difficulty with 
patient recruitment .

 Reference therapy, dose, and 
mode of administration:  Not applicable  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary Endpoints : 
The primary endpoint of the Phase 1A stage is the following:  
 Tislelizumab  safety and tolerability: The safety of tislelizumab  will be assessed throughout the study by 
monitoring AEs per the National Cancer Institute  Common Terminology for Adverse Events 
(NCI-CTCAE ) Version 4.03, physical examination , ophthalmologic examination , electrocardiograms, 
labor atory measurements  and severity of  AEs. 
The primary endpoint of the Phase 1B stage is the following:  
 ORR: (complete response [ CR] + partial response [ PR]) based on  RECIST v 1.1 in subjects with select 
tumor types  as evaluated  by the I nvestigator s. 
Secondary Endpoints : 
The secondary endpoints of the Phase 1A stage of the study are the following:  
 Pharmacokinetic evaluations : include but not limited to area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
from Day 0 to Day 14 (AUC 0-14 day), maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax), time to maxi mum 
observed plasma concentration ( Tmax), minimum observed plasma concentration ( Ctrough ), half-life (T ½), 
clearance ( Cl), and volume of distribution ( Vd). 
 The MTD , if any,  and RP2D  (s) for tislelizumab  will be determined based on safety , tolerability, PK, 
preliminary  efficacy, and other available  data. 
 Efficacy evaluations: ORR  (CR+PR ), CR  rate, PR rate, stable disease (SD) rate, progression -free 
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) , and duration of re sponse  (DOR)  will be determined based on 
RECIST v 1.1 and the results of Investigator evaluations.  
 Anti-tislelizumab  antibody: immunogenic responses to tislelizumab  will be assessed to determine 
incidence of anti -drug antibody  (ADA) .  
The secondary endpoints of the Phase 1B stage of the study are the following:  
 PFS; disease control rate (DCR: CR + PR + SD); and clinical benefit rate (CBR: CR or PR or durable 
SD [SD ≥24 weeks]).  
 Safety and tolerability assessment of AEs, serious adverse events ( SAEs ), physical examination , 
ophthalmologic  examination , vital signs, electrocardiograms ( ECG s), and laboratory measurements.

 All subjects who are expose d to (or started receiving) tislelizumab  will be included in the safety analysis set 
(SAF).  All subjects for whom valid tislelizumab  PK parameters can be estimated will be incl uded in the PK 
Population on an as -treated basis.  
Sample size  
In Phase 1A, the number of dose levels and schedules examined and the emerging tislelizumab  toxicities will 
determine the sample size.  It is anticipated that approximately 24 subjects will be required to establish the 
RP2D(s)  of tislelizumab  when administered as a single agent.  In addition, 10  to 20  subjects will be enrolled 
in each of the schedule expansion and flat dose cohort at one or more dose level (up to 10 mg/kg Q2W  or 
Q3W  in schedule expansion cohort; 200 mg Q3W in flat dose cohort ) not exceeding MTD to further evaluate 
safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of tislelizumab . 
In Phase 1B, approximately 2 0 to 50 subjects for each arm (except A rm 9) will be evaluated to examine the 
potential efficacy as well as safety  and tolerability of tislelizumab  in select tumor types.

 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background and Pharmacology  
Immune check point -inhibitory receptor, programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) is mainly 
expressed in activated T -cells including cluster of differentiation ( CD) 8+ cytotoxic 
T-lymphocytes and CD4+ T -helper lymphocytes  (McDermott and Atkins, 2013 ).  It is 
believed that PD -1 plays an important role in immune modulation of tumor progression by 
regulating the key inhibitory signaling in the T -cells when engaged by its ligands.  The PD -1 
signaling cascade negatively regulates T -cell receptor (TCR) and att enuate T -cell 
proliferation and functional activities, leading to T -cell exhaustion.  PD-1 expression is 
markedly up -regulated in tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes  (TILs) , while the expression of 
programmed death -ligand  1, (PD-L1) is significantly increased i n tumor cells and tumor -
associated immune cells in the presence of stimulating cytokines such as interferon -gamma 
(IFN-and interferon -alpha ( IFN- in the tumor  microenvironment  (Riley, 2009 ).  
Furthermore, the increased PD -1 expression in TILs  and/or PD -L1 expression in tumor and 
tumor -associated stromal cells is observed in many types of solid human tumors including, 
but not limited to, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), uveal melanoma, non-small 
cell lung cancer (NS CLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), triple -
negative breast cancer (TNBC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and ovarian 
cancer  (Ghebeh et al, 2006 ; Hamanishi et al,  2007 ; Konishi et al, 2004 ; Thompson et al, 
2007 ; Thompson et al, 2004 ; Tsushima et al, 2006 ; Jie et al, 2013 ; Hino et al, 2010 ).  This 
evidence  provided the basis for cancer immunotherapeutic intervention via the approach of 
antagonizing PD -1.  
Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant efficacy  for anti-PD-1 mo noclonal 
antibodies  such as  nivolumab and pembrolizumab  in advanced  melanoma, NSCLC and RCC .  
These antibodies were well tolerated without demonstrating dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) 
when patients were dosed up to 10 mg/kg intravenously , once every two weeks (Q2W) or 
once every three weeks (Q3W).   The first -in-human (FIH)  phase 1 trial o n nivolumab (a fully 
human anti –PD-1 immunoglobulin G [ IgG] 4 antibody) evaluated its safety profile at 
increasing doses of 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg given intravenously Q2W  in 39 patients with 
advanced melanoma, colorectal cancer ( CRC ), castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), 
NSCLC, or RCC  (Brahmer et al, 2010 ; Topalian et al, 2012 ).  The FIH Phase 1 study  on 
pembrolizumab (a humanized anti –PD-1 IgG4 antibody) evaluated its safety at 1 to 10 mg/kg 
given intravenously at 4 week interval followed by bi -weekly d oses in cohorts of three to 
six patients with various advanced solid tumors  (Hamid et al, 2013 ).  The most common  
adverse events ( AEs) were Grade 1/2, including arthralgia, cough, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, 
nausea, pruritus, and rash.  However, Grade 3/4 treatment -related AEs occurred in 15% of 
patients and there were three deaths  in the nivolumab study, all attributed to pulmonary 
toxicity.  Grade 3/4 AEs were also reported in the pembrolizumab studies and one patient

 died of myocardial infarction while being treated for pneumonitis/pneumonia.   Drug -related 
AEs of special in terest (AEs with potentially immune -related etiology) included vitiligo, 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, thyroiditis, and hypophysitis.  
Based on the overwhelming positive  results that pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
demonstrat ed in their pivotal studies, the United States ( US) Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) approved th ese two drugs for  the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 2nd or 3rd line. 
In the nivolumab p ivotal study, the cohort of 120  patients treated at 3 mg/kg  Q2W  exhibited 
an objective  response rate (ORR)  of 32% with 4 complete responses (CRs) and  34 partial 
responses (PRs).  Thirteen patients ha d object ive responses lasting  6 months or longer ( FDA 
News Release, Dec. 2, 2014 ). In the pivotal study of pembrolizumab, 173 patients were  
treated with pembrolizumab at either 2 or 10  mg/kg dose, approximately 24% patients 
demonstrated  tumor shrink age (2 mg/kg regimen ; FDA News Release, Sept. 4, 2014 ). 
Interestingly, melanoma patients who became resistant to  ipilumumab treatment  were still 
sensitive  to pembrolizumab.  The ORRs of ipilumumab -naïve and ipilumumab -resistant are 
40% and 28%, respectively .  
Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment not only generated  higher response rate, but also prolonged  
overall survival (OS).  In a cohort of 107 patients treated with nivolumab, 1 and 2 years OSs 
were 63% and 48% , respectively , with median OS at 17.3 months. Similarly  in a cohort of 
411 patients treated with pembrolizumab, 1 year OS was 69% and 18 month OS was 62% , 
respectively  (Weber et al, 2014 ). 
In addition  to melanoma, anti -PD-1 antibodies were also reported to be efficacious in other 
cancer types including NSCLC, RCC and HNSCC. In the NSCLC  study, 129 patients were 
treated with nivolumab in 2nd, 3rd or 4th line, one year or two year survival rate were  42% and 
24%, respectively,  with median OS of 9.9 months.  Retrospective analysis indicated both 
patients with K -Ras and EGFR mutations responded to the immunotherapy ( BMS  Press 
Release, 2013). 
Recent exploratory studies suggested that c ombinatory immunotherapies with anti -PD-1 
antibody may provide more benefits to cancer patients. In one study in patients with 
metastatic melanoma, nivolumab in combination with ipilumumab generated remarkable 
ORR with two year OS rate at more than  80%. Patients with wild type or mutant BRAF, with 
or without  PD-L1 expression , all responded well to the  combination treatment  (Sznol et al , 
2014 ; Wolcho k et al, 2013 ).  Of note , the immune -related AEs (irAEs) also increased 
significantly  in the combination treatment .  
Tislelizumab (also known as BGB -A317 ) is a humanized IgG4 variant monoclonal antibody 
against PD-1. It is being developed for the treatment of human malignancies. Tislelizumab  
was manufactured under Good Manufacture Practice ( GMP ) quality control systems.  The 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 32 of 207 
 clinical trial drug product is formulated in an aqueous buffer with pH  6.5 and isotonic 
osmolality.  The suggested administration route is intravenous ( IV) infusion after the 
appropriate dilution in 0 .9% sodium chloride solution.  
Tislelizumab  binds to the extracellular domain of human PD -1 with high specificity and 
affinity ( dissociation constant = 0.15 nM) as demonstrated by receptor binding assays based 
on surface plasmon resonance .  It competitively blocks the binding of both PD -L1 and 
programmed death -ligand 2 ( PD-L2), inhibiting PD -1 mediated negative signaling in T -cells.  
In in vitro  cell-based assays, the humanized antibody consistently and dose -dependently 
enhanced the functional activity of human T -cells and pre -activated, primary peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells  (PBMCs) .  In addition, tislelizumab  demonstrated anti -tumor activity in 
several human cancer allogeneic xenograft models, including A431 human epidermoid 
carcinoma, BCCO -028 colon cancer, and BCLU -054 NSCLC models, where the PBMCs 
were co -injected with the human cancer cells (A431) or the tumor fragments (BCCO -028 and 
BCLU -054) i nto the immunocompromised mice.  
The IgG4 variant antibody has very low binding affinity to fragment crystallizable region 
gamma receptor ( FcR) IIIA and complement 1q  by in vitro  assays, suggesting a low or no 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity  and complement -dependent cytotoxicity effect in 
humans.   Unlike natural IgG4 antibody, tislelizumab  has no observable fragment antigen -
binding -arm exchange activity by the in vitro  assay, predicting the antibody would be stable 
in vivo , unlikely forming bispecific antibody.  
Tislelizumab  binds to the cynomolgus monkey and human PD -1 with similar affinity, but 
does not bind to mouse PD -1 due to the significant sequence divergence from human and 
monkey PD -1.  Therefore, cynomolgus monkeys were considered to be the relevant species 
for nonclinical safety evaluation.  
Refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) for more detailed information on the background of 
tislelizumab .  
2.2 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
A pharmacokinetic (PK) study of tislelizumab  was conducted i n monkeys at single doses of 
3, 10, or 30 mg/kg or at repeat dose of 10 mg/kg weekly for 5 doses via IV infusion.  The 
systemic exposure appeared to increase dose -proportionally without gender difference or 
accumulation.  After single dose administration o f 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, the half -life (T 1/2) 
ranged from 74 to 183 hours; maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax) ranged from 
90 to 999 g/mL, and  the a rea under the plasma concentration  time curve from 0 to 1008 
hours  (AUC 0-1008h) ranged from 12,322 to 163,755 h* g/mL; volume of distribution (V d) was 
low, ranged from 22 to 52 mL/kg.

BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 33 of 207 
 A PK bridging study for tislelizumab  manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim and JHL 
Biotech Inc.  was conducted in monkeys at a single dose of 10 mg/kg vi a IV infusion.  No 
marked differences on T 1/2, Cmax, AUC, V d, clearance ( Cl) and mean residence time  were 
noted between the two batches . 
The T 1/2 of tislelizumab  in monkeys supported once biweekly dosing in the repeat -dose 
toxicology study with adequate systemic exposure to support toxicology evaluation of 
tislelizumab .  Based on PK results in monkeys, the V d of tislelizumab  in humans is expected 
to be similar to that in monkeys.  The T 1/2 of tislelizumab  in humans is expected to be 10 -20 
days depending on the actual dose levels, which allows multiple -dose treatment of 
tislelizumab  for humans with a dosing interval of 14 or 21 days to provide the target systemic 
exposure at the projected therapeutic dose of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg without excessive drug 
accumulation.  
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the PK properties of tislelizumab . 
2.3 Toxicology  
The toxicity and safety profile of tislelizumab  was characterized in single dose toxicology 
studies in mice and monkeys and in a 13 -week repeat dose toxicology study in monkeys.  The 
tissue cross reactivity was evaluated in the normal frozen tissues from both humans and 
monkeys.  The cytokine release a ssays were also evaluated using  fresh  human whole blood  
cells.  The pivotal studies were conducted following Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) 
regulations .  The single  dosing regimens were spanning from the intended human doses to 
10-fold higher than the maxi mum of the intended human doses, and the repeat dosing 
regimens spanning to 3 -fold higher than the maximum of the intended human doses.  
Cynomolgus monkey was  the only  relevant species based on the target sequence homology 
and binding activity.  
No apparen t toxicity was noted in both mice and monkeys fo llowing a single dose up to 
100 mg/kg and in monkeys following a repeat dose up to 30 mg/kg biweekly for 13 weeks.  
The toxicokinetics (TK) profile was characterized in monkey studies and the systemic 
exposur e appeared to be dose proportional without gender difference or accumulation over 
the dosing period.  No apparent immunotoxicity was observed as no apparent changes in 
clinical pathology or histopathology were noted in these studies.   The immunogenicity wi th 
positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) against tislelizumab  was noted in the single dose monkey 
study with one of two monkeys in each of three dose groups and in the repeat dose study with 
8/12, 6/12, and 5/12 of animals at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, resp ectively.  The ADA 
against tislelizumab  was demonstrated to have neutralization function in a cell based assay  
and it appeared to have some impact on the systemic expos ure over the dosing period at 
3 mg/kg, but little at 10 and 30 mg/kg .

 The tissue cross reactivity of tislelizumab  was evaluated in normal human and cynomolgus 
monkey frozen tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC) method, with appropriate positive 
and negative controls.  Under the study condition, no specific tissue cross re activity with 
tislelizumab  was noted in both human and cynomolgus monkey tissues.  Neither hemolytic 
effects induced by tislelizumab  in the rabbit blood cells nor increase of the cytokine release 
from human whole blood  cells after treatment with tislelizum ab was observed in in vitro  
evaluations.  
Overall, no apparent toxicity was noted in mice and monkey toxicity studies .  No tissue cross 
reactivity was found in both human and monkey tissues, nor effect on cytokine release was 
observed in human whole blood  assay.  The TK profile was well characterized with dose 
proportionally increases in systemic exposure without apparent accumulation or sex 
difference.  Immunogenicity was observed without apparent immunotoxicity  and effect on 
the systemic exposure.  The No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) of tislelizumab  in 
13-week monkey toxicity study was considered to be 30 mg/kg .  The safety profile of 
tislelizumab  is considered adequate to support FIH dose safely and ethically.   
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the toxicology of tislelizumab . 
2.4 Benefit -Risk Assessment  
As of March 29 , 201 6, 100 patients had received at least one dose of tislelizumab  in the 
Phase 1A part of the study , ranging from 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg  Q2W (n= 62) and from  2 
mg/kg to 5 mg/kg Q3W  (n=3 8).  During dose escalation,  the following dose levels: 0.5 mg/kg 
Q2W (n=3), 2 mg/kg Q2W (n=6), 5 mg/kg Q2W (n=6) , and 10 mg/kg Q2W (n=7)  were 
evaluated for safety and tolerability.  One DLT  (1/6)  of Grade 3 colitis was observed in the 5 
mg/kg Q2W.  Additional cohorts  of 2 mg/kg Q2W  (n=20) , 5 mg/kg Q2W  (n=20) , 2 mg/kg 
Q3W  (n=19)  and 5 mg/kg Q3W (n=19) were further evaluated as tolerated  in schedule 
expansion.      
Preliminary safety analysis showed that t he most common treatment -emergent adverse events  
(TEAEs) (≥10%) were fatigue ( 31%), diarrhoea ( 21%), nausea ( 20%), constipation (16%), 
abdominal pain ( 14%), pruritus (13%), rash ( 12%), decreased appetite ( 12%), back pain 
(12%)  and vomiting (10%) . Immune -mediated AEs were reported in 1 0 subjects including 
colitis (1 Grade  3, 2 Grade  2), diabetes mellitus (1 Grade  3, 1 Grade  2), alanine 
aminotransferase ( ALT ) increase (1  Grade  3), diarrhea (1 Grade  2), worsening liver functions 
(1 Grade  2), hypothyroidism (1  Grade  1) and onychoclasis (1 Grade  1).  As of March 29, 
2016, 9 drug-related serious adverse events (SAE)  were  reported  including 1 Grade  2 colitis 
in the 2 mg/kg Q2W dose escalation cohort (n=6), 1 Grade  3 colitis  in the 5 mg/kg Q2W dose 
escalation cohort  (n=6), 1  Grade  2 colitis and 1 Grade  2 infusion reaction in the 5 mg/kg 
Q2W schedule expansion cohort (n= 20), 1 Grade  3 diabetic ketoacidosis , 1 Grade  3 diabetes 
mellitus, 1 Grade  3 hypotension  and 1 Grade  2 diarrhoea  in the 2 mg/kg Q2W schedule

 expansion  cohort (n=20) , and 1 Grade  3 hypotension in the 5 mg/kg Q3W schedule 
expansion cohort (n=19) .  Other Grade  3/4 AEs that were considered treatment -related by the 
investigators include 1 Grade  3 ALT increase in the 2 mg/kg Q2W dose escalation cohort 
(n=6), 1 Grade  3 hyperglycaemia  in the 2 mg/kg Q2W schedule expansion cohort (n=20),  1 
Grade  3 back pain and 1 Grade  3 fatigue in the 5 mg/kg Q2W schedule expansion cohort 
(n=20), and 1 Grade  3 fatigue and 1  Grade  3 hyperglycaemia in 5 mg/kg Q3W schedule 
expansio n cohort (n=19) .  
In addition,  as of May 5, 2016, 12 subjects have been treated with tislelizumab  in 
combination with BGB -290 (a PARP1/2 inhibitor) in the BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001 
combo study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  One subject , who was treated with tislelizumab  at 2 mg/kg 
Q3W in combination of BGB -290 (a PARP1/2 inhibitor) at 20 mg BID, experienced a n 
immune -mediated  SAE of G rade 4 drug induced hepatopathy  that was attributed to 
tislelizumab  by the investigator .  
Refer to the IB for more detailed information regarding the safety of tislelizumab . 
Clinical experience with existing drugs of the same therapeutic class ( anti-PD-1 monoclonal 
antibodies ) suggests the most common AEs were Grade  1/2, including arthralgia, cough, 
diarrhea, fatigue, fever, nausea, pruritus,  and rash.  However, Grade  3/4 treatment -related 
AEs occu rred in 15% of patients in the nivolumab study, and there were three deaths, all 
attributed to pulmonary toxicity  (Brahmer et al, 2010 , Topalian et al, 2012 ).  Grade  3/4 AEs 
were also reported in the pembrolizumab studies with one subject died of myocardial 
infarction while being treated for pneumonitis/pneumonia  (Hamid et al, 20 13).  Drug -related 
AEs of special interest (AEs with potentially immune -related etiology) included vitiligo, 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis , thyroiditis, and hypophysitis  may be observed during multiple 
dose escalation in subjects with cancer.  
2.5 Study Ratio nale  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clini cal Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, t he Declaration of Helsinki and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of tislelizumab  as well as 
preliminary evidence of the anti -tumor activity of tislelizumab .  Through its dose escalation 
and safety, schedule and efficacy expansion components, it will determine the maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD ) and the recomm ended Phase 2  dose (RP2D) for tislelizumab . 
2.5.1 Rationale for Starting Dose Selection  in Phase 1A Part 1  
Selection of the Safe Starting Dose for First -In-Human Clinical Study  
Tislelizumab  has demonstrated a favorable toxicology and safety pharmacology profile in 
nonclinical ex periments.  Early clinical development of tislelizumab  will be conducted in 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 36 of 207 
 patients with advanced cancer and failed standard -care treatment.  
The relevant species for preclinical safety evaluation is monkey, because tislelizumab  binds 
to human and monkey PD-1 almost equally well, but does not bind to mouse or rat PD -1.  
From conservative point of view, the NOAEL (100 mg/kg) observed in the single dose 
toxicity study in monkeys was not used for FIH dose estimation.  Therefore, the NOAEL was 
considered to be  30 mg/kg based on the 3 -month repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys.  The FIH dose could be estimated based on NOAEL divided by a safety factor 
(10 or larger ; FDA Guidance for Industry M3(R2) , Zou et al, 2012 ).  Based on this rule, the 
FIH dose for tislelizumab  could be selected as 3 mg/kg.  
Alternatively, the FIH dose for tislelizumab  may be estimated based on the minimum 
anticipated biological effect level (MABEL).  For tislelizumab , MABEL was determined to 
be around 0.5 mg/kg, through PK/pharmacodynamic  modeling of allogeneic tumor models, 
the monkey PK, and predicted human exposure.  Therefore, the FIH dose projected based on 
the MABEL should be 0.5 mg/kg.  
Predicted e fficacious doses in human  
MABEL of tislelizumab  as described above was predicted to be 0.5 mg/kg.   Therefore, the 
selected FIH dose at 0.5 mg/kg may have efficacy on human tumor growth inhibition.  
Furthermore, the best efficacious dose rang is predicted to  be in the range of 1 to 5 mg/kg 
based on the PK/pharmacodynamic  modeling.  
2.5.2 Rationale for Evaluating Different  Dosing Schedules  in Phase 1A Part 2   
Preliminary  PK data of subjects in Phase 1A study indicate that the half -life of tislelizumab  is 
approximately 17 days and there is  moderate  drug accumulation in the blood when dosed at a 
Q2W schedule .  Thus a decision is made to investigate a less frequent dosing schedule  at 
Q3W.  The objective is to identify one or two safe, effective and conven ient dose regimen for  
the Phase 1 B study.   
2.5.3 Rationale for Evaluating Flat Dosing in Phase 1A Part 3  
Population PK analysis was conducted using 411 observed tislelizumab  serum concentrations 
from 31 patients who received doses of 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg Q2W and 13 patients who 
received doses of 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg Q3W (Phase 1A Part 1 and Part  2).  As described in 
Section 2.5.4 , PK from tislelizumab  is linear and was characterized with a 2 -compartment 
model with 1st order elimination .  In the covariate analysis, patient body weight was not 
found to be a significan t covariate on the clearance of tislelizumab  (Figure 2-1), which 
supports the exploration of flat -dosing.

Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 37 of 207 
 Figure 2-1 Lack of Correlation between Clearance (C l) and Patient Body Weight  
Thus a decision is made  to explore flat dosing as part of the Phase 1A study, conducted in 
parallel with a Phase 1B study that evaluates the RP2D as described  in Section 2.5.4 .  The 
proposed flat dose of 200 mg Q3W ha s the dose intensity between 2 mg/kg Q 3W and 
10 mg/kg Q2W. Tislelizumab  is generally well tolerated between these doses.  
2.5.4 Rationale for Dose Selection  in Phase 1B   
After reviewing safety and PK data from Phase 1A Part 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 1A 
Part 2 (schedule expansion), the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) has recommend ed 
5 mg/kg  Q3W as the dose regimen to be taken into Phase 1B of the study, based on the 
following rationales:  
Safety   
As of March 29 , 2016, 100 patients received at least one dose of tislelizumab  in the Phase 1A 
part of the study , ranging from 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg Q2W (n=62) and from  2 mg/kg to 
5 mg/kg Q3W  (n=38).   Safety and to lerability including dose limiting toxicities, PK, and 
preliminary efficacy were evaluated.  
As describ ed in Section 2.4, all dose levels in the dose escalation part were well tolerated 
with only one reported DLT.  MTD was not reached and 10 mg/kg Q2W was considered the 
maximum administered dose  (MAD).  No appa rent relationship between  dose level and AEs 
was established . 
Drug -related AE from  2 mg/kg Q2W to 10 mg/kg Q2W were similar  (Table 1 and Table 2). 
AE profiles from Q3W regimen between 2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg based on data reported from  
the first 2 cycles slightly favor 2 mg/kg, although with short treatment duration.   

BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 38 of 207 
 Tislelizumab  is generally well tolerated between these doses with slightly fewer  AEs from 
the Q3W regimen.  
Efficacy  
Clinical response (PR or better) was observed in patients who  received 0.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 
5 mg/kg Q2W, and 2 mg/kg Q3W cohorts ( Table 3).  The majority of responses  came from 
5 mg/kg coho rts.  The proposed Phase 1B dose of 5 mg/kg Q3W has a dose intensity between 
2 mg/kg Q3W and 5 mg/kg Q2W.  Further investigation of 5 mg/kg Q3W is warranted.

Population Pharmacokinetics  
Population PK analysis was conducted using 411 observed tislelizumab  serum concentrations 
from 31 patients who received doses of 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg Q2W and 13 patients who 
received doses of 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg Q3W (Phase 1A Part 1 and Part 2).  PK from 
tislelizumab  is linear and was characterized with a 2 -compartment model with 1st order 
elimination.  Systemic clearance of A317 was 0.00789 L/h, volume of distribution in the 
central and peripheral compartment are 2.79 and 1.44 L, respectively, and  terminal 
elimination half -life is 16 days.  
In conclusion, tislelizumab  regimen of 5 mg/kg Q3W was well -tolerated with promising 
clinical activity from a limited number of patients in the Phase 1A trial.   Further testing of 
this regimen is warranted in Pha se 1B.  
2.5.5 Rationale for Selection of Different Expansion Arms in Phase 1B   
Rationale for the selection of cancer indications included in the 9 expansion arms is based on 
in vivo  tumor growth inhibition studies, which demonstrated  that tislelizumab  have 
signif icantly higher  antitumor activities  than nivolumab and pembrolizumab in mouse 
model s carrying allogenic human cancer cells and PBMCs (see Figure 2-2).  Therefore, we 
hypothes ized that tislelizumab  may be more efficacious  than nivolumab and pembrolizumab  
in certain insensitive  cancer types .

Page 41 of 207 
 Figure 2-2 Comparison of Tumor Growth Inhibition by the Treatme nt with 
Tislelizumab  versus Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab in the Mouse Cancer M odel  
       
We also selected tumor types where  nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown various 
clinical efficacies , including melanoma, lung cancer, RCC, HNSCC, hepatocellular 
carcinoma ( HCC ), bladder, gastric, ovarian and breast cancer.   The ORRs  for nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab in these tumors range from 15 to 35%  with durable response shown  in most 
cases .  Tislelizumab  is expected to be equal or more efficacious  in some indica tions such as 
HCC, ovarian, gastric , TNBC , bladder cancer and NSCLC. It is also hypothesized that 
tislelizumab  may show better therapeutic potential when used in combination with certain 
cancer therapeutic agents.  The hypothesis that  tislelizumab  may pose  differential activities 
from  nivolumab and pembrolizumab is based on our studies on tumor microenvironment and 
other  factors driving tumorigenesis and progression  in different cancer types .  
Based on the discussion above, the 9 expansion arms may be  class ified into the following 
categories : 
1. Indications where  nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown variable efficacy with 
ORR ranging from 10+ to 20+%, but tislelizumab  is expected to be more active , such 
as NSCLC, HCC, ovarian  cancer , gastric  cancer , esophageal  cancer  and TNBC , 
which are covered  in the expansion arms 1-8. 
2. Indications in which nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown very good efficacy 
and tislelizumab  is anticipated to be equally or more active , such as melanoma, RCC 
and bladder cancer, which are covered in the expansion Arm 9.  A recent study 
indicated that a small portion (15%) of CRC patients with mismatch repair deficiency 
(dMMR)  responded well to pembrolizumab  (Le et al, 2015 ).  Tislelizumab  is

 expected to be equally or more active based on promising Phase 1A data. Cancers  
with microsatellite instability -high ( MSI-H) or dMMR will be explored in this arm.

 4.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of the Phase  1A stage is the following:  
 Tislelizumab  safety and tolerability: The safety of tislelizumab  will be assessed 
throughout the study by monitoring AEs per the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (NCI-CTCAE version [v] 4.03 2010 ), physical 
examination , ophthalmologic  examination , electrocardiograms, laboratory measurements 
and severity of AEs 
Given the mechanism of action by tislelizumab  involves immune regulatory function, 
particular attention should be given to irAEs, which include pruritus, vitiligo, pruritic rash, 
macular rash, hypopigmentation, and other skin disorders; hypo - and hyperthyr oidism, 
hypophysitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, allergic rhinitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
fatigue, hypersensitivity and any other irAEs  (see Section  7.3.4 ).  Appropriate investigations 
should be undertaken to exclude toxic, metabolic, infectious, neoplastic or other non -drug-
related etiologic causes of such events.  
The primary endpoint of the Phase 1 B stage is the following:  
 ORR  (CR + PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v 1.1 
in subjects with select tumor types  as evaluated  by the I nvestigator s 
Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) criteria  (Scher et a l, 2008 ) may 
also be used to evaluate responses in patients with prostate cancer enrolled on the study as 
describe d in Appendix  9. 
The Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup ( GCIG ) criteria  (Rustin et al,  2011 ) in addition  to 
RECIST  v 1.1 may also be used to evaluate response in patients with ovarian cancer  enrolled 
on the study . 
Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (RANO) criteria  (Wen et al, 2010 ) may also be 
used to evaluate  response in patients with glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) enrolled on the 
study.  
4.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The se condary endpoints of the Phase 1 A stage of the study are the following:  
 Pharmacokinetic evaluations: include but not limited to AUC from Day 0 to Day 14 
(AUC 0-14 day), Cmax, time to maxi mum concentration ( Tmax), minimum observed

 plasma concentration ( Ctrough), T½, clearance ( Cl), and V d.  The MTD , if any,  and 
RP2D  (s) for tislelizumab  will be determined based on safety , tolerability, PK, 
preliminary  efficacy, and other available  data. 
 Efficacy evaluations: ORR  (CR+PR ), CR rate, PR rate, stable disease ( SD) rate, 
progression -free survival ( PFS), OS and duration of response  (DOR ) will be determined 
based on RECIST  v 1.1 and the results of Investigator  evaluations  
 Anti-tislelizumab  antibody: Immunogenic responses to tislelizumab  will be assessed to 
determine incidence of ADA  
The secondary endpoints of  the Phase 1 B stage of the study are the following:  
 PFS as described above; disease control rate (DCR: C R + PR + SD); and clinical benefit 
rate (CBR: CR or PR or durable SD [SD ≥24 weeks] ) 
 Safety and tolerability assessment of AEs, SAEs, physical examination , ophthalmologic

5.1  Summary of Study Design  
This is a two -stage study consisting of a Phase 1A dose escalation and dose -finding 
component to establish the MTD, if any, and RP2D(s), followed by a Phase 1B component to

 investigate efficacy in select tumor types and to further evaluate safety and tolerability of 
tislelizumab  at RP2D(s).   
Archival tumor tissue will be collected for purpose of biomarker analysis, although a fresh 
tumor biopsy at baseline is st rongly recommended.  In the absence of archival tumor tissues, 
a fresh biopsy of a tumor lesion is required at baseline; for these subjects, an optional biopsy 
for biomarker analysis after two cycles of treatment is strongly recommended.  Optional 
biopsy w ill also be taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who have confirmed 
disease progression during the study from accessible tumor sites to obtain samples to explore 
resistance mechanism.  If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally tak en from the 
same tumor lesion as the baseline biopsy.  Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor 
biopsies.  
Mandatory biopsies  at baseline and on treatment are required for some tumor types in the 
Phase 1B study.    
Subjects will be monitored for safety, anti -tislelizumab  antibodies and efficacy throughout 
the study.  Radiological assessment of tumor response status should be performed 
approximately every 8  weeks or 9 weeks depending on dosing schedules in the first year, 
then every 12  weeks thereafter.  
A flow chart of the study design is presented in  Appendix  7. 
5.1.1 Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
All toxicities or AEs will be graded according to the  NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 .  The 
occurrence of a ny of the following toxicities during Cycle 1 will be considered a  DLT, if 
judged by the Investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study  drug 
administration:  
Non-hematologic:  
1. Grade 5 adverse events  
2. Grade 4 toxicity  
3. Grade 3 toxicities irrespective of duration, with the exception of laboratory abnormalities, 
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities that 
improve to Grade 2 or lesser severity within 3 days of institution of supportive care  
4. Grade 3 tumor fla re (defined as local pain, irritation, or rash  localized at sites of known or 
suspected tumor ) of > 7 day duration  
5. Immune -related adverse events (irAE) of Grade 3 or greater severity

6. Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities irrespective of duration  
 
7. Grade 2 ophthalmologic toxicities  
 
Hematologic:  
1. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days  
2. Febrile neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000/mm3 with a 
single temperature of 38.3oC or a sustained temperature of 38oC for >1 hour)  
3. Grade 3 neutropenic in fection  
4. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
5. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
6. Grade 4 (life threatening) anemia  
Any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor requires removal of 
the subject from the study.  
Subjects who received <90% of the tislelizumab  infusion in Cycle 1 (eg, because the infusion 
had to be discontinued due to an infusion reaction) and did not experience a DLT will not be 
taken into account in the assessment of the overall DLT rate for the particular dose level 
cohort an d will need to be replaced.  
Resumption of tislelizumab  administration for subjects experiencing DLTs may be permitted  
according to the criteria described in Section 5.1.2 , if clinically appropriate, contingent on the 
return of the DLT to ≤ Grade 0-1 severity and interruption or delay of treatment for no more 
than 6 weeks (12 weeks for Phase 1A Part 3 and Phase 1B).  
5.1.2 Dose Modifications , Dose Delay and Missing Dose  
Dose adjustments will be allowed for tislelizumab  for weight changes  at the beginning of 
each cycle.  Dose must be adjusted if body weight changes reach 10% or greater (increase or 
decrease) .  
In the case that an infusion cannot be administere d at a scheduled visit, the instruction below 
should be followed.   If the delay is between 1 and 7 days for Q2W schedule and 1 to 10 days 
for Q3W schedule, the  subject should be dosed as soon as possible and  procedures at the 
original scheduled visit shoul d be performed.  If the delay is more than 7 (for Q2W) or 10  
(for Q3W)  days, the delayed dose should be skipped  and considered a missed dose, the

 subject  will be dosed at Day 1 of the next scheduled cycle.  In both cases, subsequent visits 
will follow ever y 2 weeks (Q2W schedule) or Q3W schedule  according to the original 
schedules .  Subjects with infusion delays > 6 weeks  from planned dosing date for reason(s) 
other than treatment -related toxicity should normally discontinue treatment and enter the 
Follow -up Period with the exception of delays related to prophylactic vaccinations or after 
specific consultation and agreement between the Investigator and Sponsor medical monitor 
in settings where benefit/risk may justify continued study therapy (eg, subject der iving 
clinical benefit who requires prolonged steroid taper for management of non -DLT irAEs).  
Tislelizumab  will be withheld for any of the following treatment -related adverse 
reactions : 
1. Grade 2 pneumonitis  
2. Grade 2 or 3 colitis /diarrhea  
3. Grade 3-4 hypophysit is 
4. Grade 2 -3 nephritis  
5. Grade 3 -4 thyroid disorders  
6. Grade 2 -3 ALT or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) elevations  
7. Grade 2 neurological toxicity  
8. Grade 3 skin reactions  
9. Grade 3 -4 diabetes/hyperglycemia  
10. Grade 3 ocular toxicity  
11. Grade 3 pancreatitis  
12. Grade 3 arthritis  
13. Grade 3 mucositis/stomatitis  
14. Grade 2 -4 Myositis/Rhabdomyolysis  
15. Grade 1 Myocarditis  
16. Any other severe or Grade 3 treatment -related adverse reaction  except for asymptomatic 
laboratory  abnormalities

 Refer to Section 7.3 and Appendix  10 for more detailed information regarding dose 
modification and management of irAEs.  
In Phase 1A Part 1 and 2, tislelizumab  dosing can be resumed for subjects whose adverse 
reactions recover to Grade 0 -1 within 6 weeks.  The dosing interval in subsequent cycles may 
be increased  by 1 week (eg, to 3 weeks in subjects who were on Q2W schedule, and to 
4 weeks in subjects who were on Q3W schedule) .  The visit and assessment schedule for 
subjects on 3 week  interval will follow  those designed for Q3W, and the visit and assessment 
schedule for subjects on 4 week  interval will follow those designed for Q2W, but maybe with 
reduced freque ncy for some of the assessments at the Investigator ’s discretion.   The dosing 
interval can only be prolonged once.   
In Phase 1A Part 3, tislelizumab  dosing can be resumed for subjects whose adverse reactions 
recover to Grade 0 -1 within 12 weeks after last dose of tislelizumab .  The tislelizumab  dose 
may be resumed to original dose level and schedule if deemed necessary by the Investigator 
after consultation with the Sponsor.  
In Phase 1B, tislelizumab  dosing can be resumed for subjects whose adverse reactio ns 
recover to Grade 0 -1 within 12 weeks after last dose of tislelizumab .  The tislelizumab  dose 
may be resumed to original dose level and schedule if deemed necessary by the investigator 
after consultation with the Sponsor.  
Two dosing delays due to toxicity will be permitted.  In the event of a third occurrence of  a 
toxicity which would require dosing delay, study therapy will be discontinued  permanently  
after consultation with the Sponsor . 
Tislelizumab  will be permanently di scontinued for any of the following  after 
consultation with  the Sponsor : 
1. Severe or life -threatening adverse reactions, including any of the following:  
 Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity  
 Grade 4  hematologic  toxicity, including Grade 4 neutropenia that last >7  days 
 Grade 4 colitis /diarrhea, diarrhea with abdominal pain, fever, ileus, or peritoneal 
signs; increase in stool  frequency (7 or more over baseline), stool incontinence, need 
for intravenous  hydration for more than 24 hours, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and 
gastrointestinal perforation  
 Grade 4 AST or ALT

  Grade 4 skin reactions, Steven -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or 
rash complicated by full  thickness dermal ulceration or necrotic, bullous or 
hemorrhagic manifestations  
 Severe (ie, CTCAE Gr ade 3 or 4) motor or sensory neuropathy, Guillain -Barré  
syndrome, or myasthenia gravis  
 Severe (ie, CTCAE Grade 3 or 4)  immune -mediated reactions involving any organs 
(eg, nephritis,  pneumonitis, pancreatitis, non -infectious myocarditis)  
 Immune -mediated ocular disease that is unresponsive to topical  immunosuppressive 
therapy , Grade 4 ocular toxicity  
 Grade 4 mucositis/stomatitis  
 Grade 2 -4 Myocarditis  
 Grade 3 or above  infusion reaction  (except for a  transient  Grade 3 infusion reaction 
that resolv es within 6 hours of onset)  (Section 7.3.2 ) 
2. Inability to reduce corticosteroid dose for immune -related adverse reactions to <10 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day  
In case a subject  is benefiting from the study treatment  while meeting the discontinuation 
criteria describe d above, discussion between  Sponsor and Investigator  will be conducted to 
make a decision that will be in the best interest of the subject.  
Refer to Section 7.3.4  and Appendix  10 for more details about irAEs and management  
of such events . 
5.1.3 Phase 1A Part 1 : Dose Escalation  
The Phase 1A, Part 1 component is a multicenter, open label, multiple dose, dose escalation, 
first in human study.  Four dose levels are planned: 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg, Q2W as 
presented in Table 4.  The highest dose to be tested during dose escalation is 10 mg/kg  Q2W .  
If 0/3 subject s or ≥ 1/6 subject s develop a DLT at that dose, then  MTD is not reached and  
10 mg/kg is considered the M AD.

Abbreviations: Q2W, every two weeks . 
1 The actual dose levels and dose regimens administered in each step will depend on the data available 
from the previous step, as determined by the SMC.  
After the first subject  in the first dose level  receives the Cycle 1, Day 1 dose, subsequent 
subject s in the first cohort will not be dosed until the first subject  has been observed for 
at least 24 hours to exclude unexpected acute toxicity.  
Continuous safety evaluation will be performed by the Sponsor, the Coordinating 
Investigator , and Investigator s.  An SMC will be established for the determination of dose 
levels to be administered and dose regimen during dose escalation, and will utilize the data 
available from the previous dose levels (see Section 8.3.1  for committee composition).  
5.1.3.1  Dose Escalation and Dose Finding  
Evaluation of a cohort of at least three (3)  subjects completing one cyc le of treatment at that 
dose level and dose regimen without a DLT is required prior to determining the next dose 
level and dose regimen for the next cohort.   
The study will follow a modified 3+3 dose escalation scheme.  At least three (3) subjects will 
be enrolled into each cohort.  Additional subject(s), up to a maximum of six (6) subjects in 
total, will be enrolled if more than three (3) have been screened and are eligible for the 
cohort.  Dose-escalation scheme will follow the rules stipulated  in the standard 3 + 3 dose 
escalation scheme .  For example, three (3) additional subjects will be enrolled if a DLT is 
observed in one (1) of three (3) subjects; additional two (2) subjects will be enrolled if a DLT 
is observed in one (1) of four (4) subj ects; and additional one (1) subject will be enrolled if a 
DLT is observed in one (1) of five (5) subjects.  No additional subjects are required if a DLT 
is observed in one (1) of six (6) subjects.  
If none (0) of the subjects in the cohort experience a DLT  by the end of Cycle  1, escalation to 
the next dose will occur , as determined by the SMC . 
If one (1) out of six (6) subjects experience a DLT by the end of Cycle  1, escalation to the 
next dose will occur , as determined by the SMC.  
No additional subjects wi ll be treated at a given dose level if two (2) or more  of the subjects 
in a cohort develop a DLT in Cycle  1.  In this instance the MTD is considered to have been

Page 51 of 207 
 exceeded  and as noted above, the MTD will be considered to be the dose level below this 
level  or an intermediate  dose level that has been evaluated and has not exceeded the MTD . 
The SMC may decide to evaluate  an intermediate, not pre -defined and not  previously -studied 
dose or less frequent dosing schedule ( eg, Q3W ), if evaluation of toxicity at suc h a dose or 
schedule is desired.  If this  approach is taken, up to 6  new subject s should be enrolled at the 
new intermediate dose  or schedule . 
Subject s who received <90% of the tislelizumab  infusion in Cycle 1 ( eg, because the infusion 
had to be discontinued due to an infusion reaction) and did not experience a DLT will not be 
taken into account in the assessment of the overall DLT rate for the particular dose level 
cohort and need to be replaced.   
5.1.3.2  Schedule of Assessment  
The schedule of events for  Phase 1A Part 1 is presented in  Table 5 and the PK sampling 
schedule in  Table  6.

 6. Electrocardiogram assessments are to be performed with the subject in semi recumbent supine  position  and rested for 5 minut es. Electrocardiogram (12 -
lead ECG) should be performed at Screening  as baseline,  at the time of PK blood collection for PK (C max) within 30 minutes after the end of the first 
infusion of  tislelizumab , after infusion of tislelizumab  in Day 15 of Cycle 1 an d Day 1 of every subsequent cycle (within 30 minutes after the end of 
infusion), and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up visit . Additional ECGs may be obtained if  clinically indicated  (refer to Section 8.2.3 ). 
7. Adverse experiences and laboratory safety measurements will be graded per NCI -CTCAE v 4.03. All adverse experiences, whether gradable by CTCAE 
or not, will also  be evaluated for seriousness.   After the first dose of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of their assessed relationship to study 
drug, are to be reported until either 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or the initiation of new anticancer ther apy, whichev er occurs first . 
Telephone contacts with patients should be conducted to assess immune -related AEs 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab regardless of whether or 
not the patient starts a new ant icancer therapy.  If patients report a suspected immune -related AE at a telephone follow -up contact, the investigator 
should arrange an unscheduled visit if further assessment is indicated.  All drug -related SAEs will be recorded by the Investigator after treatment 
discontinuation until subject death or loss to f ollow -up, whichever occurs first.  
8. Routine laboratory tests ( eg, hematology,  chemistry , and  urinalysis) will be performed by the  local study site laboratory or their contract laboratory.  
Hematology , chemistry , and urinalysis may be collected up to 72 hours  prior to any Cycle Day 1 and Day 15 dosing . Of note, creatine kinase ( CK) and 
creatine kinase – cardiac muscle isoenzyme ( CK-MB) will be assessed as part of the serum chemistry panel (as per Appendix 2 ).  In the event  CK-MB 
fractionation is not available, please  assess  troponin I and/or  troponin T  instead .  
9. Prothro mbin T ime (P T)/International Normalized Ratio ( INR) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin T ime ( aPTT ) should be collected at Screening and 
at the mandatory S afety Follow -up Visit after discontinuation of study therapy. Coagulation parameters should be  determined throughout the study 
when clinically indicated. PT/INR and aPTT will be analyzed by the local study site laboratory.  
10. Only in women of childbearing pot ential. Subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 7 days before  the first investigational 
product administration).  
11. Only for the dose -escalation subjects treated in Melbourne sites  due to sample and assay logistics. Cycle 1: predose  Day 1 and Day 15; Cycle 2  and 
every cycle  in first 6 months: predose Day  1; at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit.  Collect 40 mL blood in acid -citrate -dextrose (ACD) on the date 
indicated, transport within 8 hours to the central laboratory. Fluor escence -activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations and 
other immune cells, and analysis of cytokines/chemokines will be performed.  
12. T3, T4, TSH; at every cycle, and at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit. Analysis of T3, T4 and TSH  will be performed by the local study site 
laboratory .

 13. Analysis of IgG and IgM at predose of Day 1 of every cycle in the first 12 months, approximately every 8 weeks thereafter, and at the Safety  Follow -Up 
Visit. Analysis will be performed by the local stu dy site laboratory.  
14. Blood for anti -tislelizumab  antibodies should be collected within 24 hours before start of Day 1 infusion every cycle in the first 6 months, every 2 cycle s 
in the next 6 months, approximately every 6 months thereafter, and at the mandat ory Safety Follow -Up Visit. In subjects who discontinue study therapy 
before 6 months, every effort should be made to analyze anti -tislelizumab  antibodies approximately 6 months after the first dose. Analysis  will be 
performed by a central laboratory.  
15. Bloo d collected at predose on Day 1 of every  cycle  until 6 months of study , and at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who have confirmed disease 
progression during the study to explore resistance mechanism . Samples will be processed according to the L ab Manual.  
16. For timing refer to  Table 6 Phase 1A Part 1 Pharmacokinetic Sampling  for details on timing of pharmacokinetics sample collection. Procedures for 
collection of samples are  described in the Lab Manual.  
17. Testing will be performed by the local laboratory at Screeni ng. Include Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody  (HCVAb) , Hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg ), Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) 1/2 antibodies.  Subjects who are HBsAg and HBcAb positive 
or HCV antibody positive at screening must not be enrolled until further definite testing with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) 
titers and HCV ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) tests can conclusively rule o ut presence of active infection requiring therapy with Hepatitis B and C , 
respectively . Subjects enrolled in the study who had detectable HBV DNA or HCV RNA at Screening should be tested for HBV or HCV viral load,  
respectively, every 4 cycles (± 7 days) th roughout the study, eg Screening, Cycle 5, Cycle 9, and so on (and whenever clinically indicated). For subjects 
who already received 4 or more doses of study drug, the viral load test should be repeated at the subject’s next visit and ev ery 4 cycles accord ing to the 
schedule from first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1), and whenever clinically indicated. HCC subjects who test positive for HCV will not be discontinued. HCC 
subjects  who test positive for HBV should be treated as per local guidelines  at the investigator’s discretion . 
18. Standard tumor markers (eg, alpha fetoprotein [AFP] for HCC  and cancer antigen 125 [CA 125] for ovarian cancer , as appropriate for a given tumor 
type) will be collected within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, and while on study approximately every 2 months in  the first 12 months and 
approximately every 3 months thereafter , and at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit . Analysis will be performed by the local study site laboratory 
where feasible. If not feasible, tests will be  performed by a cent ral laboratory.  
19. Tumor imaging (either computed tomography [ CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI ], with preference for CT) will be performed within 28 days 
prior to enrollment, and while on study approximately every 8 weeks  in the first 12 months and appr oximately every 12 week s thereafter. The same 
imaging technique should be used in a subject throughout the study. After first  documentation of response (CR or PR) , imaging performed at the next

 regularly scheduled time point will be used  for response confi rmation. After patient ’s re-consenting, Progressive disease (PD) suspected as pseudo -
progression needs to be confirmed  in a subsequent imaging at least 4 weeks later or at the next regularly scheduled time point but not to exceed 
12 weeks, before discontin uation  of study treatment . Subjects who stop treatment prior to documentation of PD will undergo repeated imaging 
for tumor response assessments during the study approximately  every 8 weeks or 9  weeks  depending on dosing schedules in the first 12 months 
and approximately every 12 weeks thereafter  until unequivocal PD is documented or the subject  starts new anticancer  therapies or subject  
withdraws  consent  from the trial. This imaging schedule will be maintained and will never be adjusted regardless of any  intermediate 
unscheduled scans.  Subjects who withdraw from the study for clinical or symptomatic deterioration before objective documenta tion of PD will 
be requested to undergo appropriate imaging to confirm PD.  Every effort will be made to confirm a cl inical diagnosis of PD by imaging  
(Section 5.2.5.2 ). 
20. Bone scans must be done for subjects with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) as described in Section 8.2.4 . For other 
subjects, bone scans at baseline or subsequent visits will be performed only if clinically indicat ed. 
21. Collection of archival tumor tissue for purpose of biomarker analysis. Written patient consent is  required for collection of archival tumor tissue. Specific 
instructions for tissue collection and shipment are provided in the Lab Manual.  
22. Archival tumor tissue  will be collected for purpose of biomarker analysis , although a fresh baseline tumor biopsy (within 8 weeks before  starting 
treatme nt) is strongly recommended . In the absence of archival tumor tissues, a fresh baseline biopsy of a tumor lesion is  mandatory; for these  subjects, 
an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis after 2 cycles of treatment  (approximately C ycle 3 Day 1) is strongly recommended . Optional biopsy will also 
be taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who have confirmed d isease progression during the  study  from accessible tumor sites to obtain 
samples to explore resistance mechanism . If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally taken from the same tumor lesion as the baseline biopsy. 
Written patient consent is requi red for fresh tumor biopsies . Fresh biopsies should be limited to readily accessible  tumor lesions ( eg, skin; peripheral 
lymph nodes; lung, liver or internal lymph node metastases which can be readily accessed using CT guidance). If performed, a core or ex cisional biopsy 
of the tumor (cytologic or fine -needle aspiration samples are not acceptable) should be obtained that has proper size for histological examination and 
biomarker analysis ( eg, IHC of PD -1, PD -L1, PD -L2; genomic  profiling).   
23. Following complet ion of the treatment and  Safety Follow -up phases of the study, every effort should be made to follow up all subjects for their survival 
status until subject death  or termination by the Sponsor . 
24. Ophthalmologic exam (such as eyesight /visual acuity , fundoscopic , slit lamp microscopy , and optical coherence tomography  [or equivalent diagnostic 
test]) within 28  days prior to first dose, Cycle 1 Day 15 (±1 day), and Cycle 3 Day 1  (±7 days ). Subjects will subsequently undergo repeat assessments

 by an appropriate specialist approximately every 4 cycles/ 16 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment and a final assessment  <30 days after the last dose 
of study treatment.  For those subjects who have already received 2 or more doses of study drug, the exam  should be repeated at the subject ’s next visit 
and then approximately every 4 cycles/1 6 weeks according to the schedule from first dose (Cycle 1 Day1).  Investigators should solicit subjects 
regarding changes in vision, visual disturbance, or ocular inflammation at each scheduled study visit during tislelizumab  treatment.  For any change in 
vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be made for further management guidance  (see Appendix 10 ).

Please note: Actual drug dosing and PK sampling times have to be documented by the sites and will be captured in the database.  
1. Sample collection must be from opposite arm to that used for study drug infusion. If drug was administered via a central veno us catheter, sample collection 
for PK should be  from a different site.  
2. Window: ±20 minutes.  
3. Window: ±2 hours.  
4. Cycle 2 and subsequently every cycle except for Cycle 4 during the first 12 months of study therapy, approximately every 6 months thereafter.  
5. PK assays should be performed at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit.  
Should a subject present with a DLT or any Grade  3 or above  immune -related adverse event (refer to Section 7.3.4 ), additional blood PK samples will 
be taken to determine the plasma concentration of tislelizumab .

 5.1.4 Phase 1A Part 2: Schedule  Expansion  
The Phase 1A, Part 2 component wi ll evaluate the safety and PK of two dosing schedules 
Q2W versus Q3W at selected doses that have cleared the DLT period without exceeding 
MTD ( eg, 2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg, up to 10 mg/kg). Ten to 20  subjects per dose schedule will be 
enrolled to evaluate the safety, the PK and preliminary efficacy.  Tumors types to be enrolled 
include  but not limited to CRC,  NSCLC, RCC , bladder  cancer , ovarian  cancer and  
melanoma .  Other cancers that are deemed to be likely to benefit from PD -1 inhibition based 
on high mutational load, preclinical or clinical data from other studies may be considered for 
enrollment subject to discussion with the medical monitor .  
5.1.4.1  Criteria for Stopping Phase  1A Part 2  
The doses selected for the Q2W schedule expan sion will have been evaluated for DLT and 
demonstrated as safe in the Phase 1A Part 1 study.  These doses administrated at a less 
frequent  schedule of Q3W should be safe as well.  Nevertheless, to  adequately monitor safety 
of subjects enrolled in dosing schedule expansion, when at least 6 subjects have been treated 
at a specific dose and schedule and ≥33% of the subjects experienced a DLT during the first 
cycle  in both Q2W and Q3W schedules (as def ined in Section 5.1.1  of the protocol) , study 
accrual will be held pendi ng data review by the SMC.  Tislelizumab  will also be withheld in 
the event of other serious adverse reactions according to pre -specified criteria  (as defined in 
Section 5.1.2  of the prot ocol) .  Q2W and Q3W schedule expansion may be conducted 
sequentially or in parallel . 
In the event that a MTD is not identified, RP2D and dosing regimen used in the Phase 1B 
stage will be determined by the SMC and the Sponsor based on the PK, tolerability and 
preliminary antitumor activities observed in the Phase 1A stage , as well as other available 
data.   Based on the Phase 1A data, more than one dose or dosing regimen may be selected to 
be further evaluated in Phase 1B for safety and prelim inary efficacy in select tumor types.  
5.1.4.2  Schedule of Assessment  
The schedule of events for Phase 1A Part 2 is presented in  Table 7 (Q2W sche dule) and 
Table 8 (Q3W schedule).

study therapy before 6 months, every effort should be made to analyze anti -tislelizumab  antibodies approximately 6 months after the first dose. 
Analysis  will be perf ormed by a central laboratory.  
14. Blood collected at predose on Day 1 of every  cycle  until 6 months of study , and at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who have confirmed 
disease progression during the  study  to explore resistance mechanism . Samples will be processed according to the Lab Manual.  
15. Procedures for collection of PK samples are  described in the Lab Manual. Predose (within 60 min before start infusion) and postdose ( within 30 min  
after the end of infusion ) samples should be collected at Cycl e 1 Day 1 , Day 15 , Day 1 of Cycle 2 and subsequently every cycle in the first 12 
months , then approximately every 6 months thereafter; two PK samples should be collected at Cycle 1 Day 4 (or 5) and Day 8; additional PK 
samples should be collected at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit.  Should a subject present with a DLT or any Grade  3 or above immune -related 
adverse event (refer to Section 7.3.4 ), additional blood PK samples will be taken to determine the plasma concentration of tislelizumab . 
16. Testing will be performed by the local laboratory at Screening. Include HCV antibody , HBsAg, HBcAb and HIV 1/2 antibodies.  Subjects who are 
HBsAg and HBcAb po sitive or HCV antibody positive at screening must not be enrolled until further definite testing with HBV DNA titers and 
HCV RNA tests can conclusively rule out presence of active infection requiring therapy with Hepatitis B and C respectively.  Subjects en rolled in the 
study who had detectable HBV DNA or HCV RNA at Screening should be tested for HBV or HCV viral load, respectively, every 4 cy cles (± 7 days) 
throughout the study, eg Screening, Cycle 5, Cycle 9, and so on (and whenever clinically indicated). For subjects who already received 4 or more 
doses of study drug, the viral load test should be repeated at the subject’s next visit and every 4 cycles according to the s chedule from first dose 
(Cycle 1 Day 1), and whenever clinically indicated. HCC subject s who test positive for HCV will not be discontinued. HCC subjects who test 
positive for HBV should be treated as per local guidelines at the investigator’s discretion.

18. Tumor imaging (either CT or MRI, with preference for CT) will be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment, and while on st udy approximately 
every 8 weeks  in the first 12 months and approximately every 12 week s thereafter. The same imaging technique should be used in a subject 
throughout the study. After first  documentation of response (CR or PR) , imaging performed at the next  regularly scheduled time point will be used  
for response confirmation. After patient ’s re-consenting, PD suspected as pseudo -progression needs to be confirmed  in a subsequent imaging 
at least 4 weeks later or at the next regularly scheduled time point but not to exceed 12 weeks, before discontinuation  of study treatment . 
Subjects who stop treatment prior to documentation of PD will undergo repeated imaging for tumor response assessments during the study 
approximately  every 8 weeks or 9  weeks  depending on dosing schedules in the first 12 months and approximately every 12 weeks thereafter  
until unequivocal PD is documented or the subject  starts new anticancer  therapies or subject  withdraws  consent  from the trial. This 
imaging schedule will be m aintained and will never be adjusted regardless of any intermediate unscheduled scans.  Subjects who withdraw 
from the study for clinical or symptomatic deterioration before objective documentation of PD will be requested to undergo ap propriate 
imaging to confirm PD.  Every effort will be made to confirm a clinical diagnosis of PD by imaging  (Section  5.2.5.2 ).  
19. Bone scans must be done for subjects wit h mCRPC  as described in Section 8.2.4 . For other subjects, bone scans at baseline or subsequent visits will 
be performed only if clinically indicated.  
20. Collection of archival tumor tissue for purpose of biomarker analysis. Written  patient consent is  required for collection of archival tumor tissue. 
Specific instructions for tissue collection and shipment are provided in the Lab Manual.  
21. Archival tumor tissue  will be collected for purpose of biomarker analysis , although a fresh basel ine tumor biopsy (within 8 weeks before  starting 
treatme nt) is strongly recommended . In the absence of archival tumor tissues, a fresh baseline biopsy of a tumor lesion is  mandatory; for these  
subjects, an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis after 2 cyc les of treatment  (approximately C ycle 3 Day 1) is strongly recommended . Optional 
biopsy will also be taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who have confirmed disease progression during the  study  from accessible 
tumor sites to obtain samples to explore resistance mechanism . If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally taken from the same tumor lesion 
as the baseline biopsy. Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor biopsies . Fresh biopsies should be limited to readily accessib le tumor 
lesions ( eg, skin; peripheral lymph nodes; lung, liver or internal lymph node metastases which can be readily accessed using CT guidance ). If 
performed, a core or excisional biopsy of the tumor (cytologic or fine -needle aspiration samples are not acceptable) should be obtained that has 
proper size for histological examination and biomarker analysis ( eg, IHC of PD -1, PD -L1, PD -L2; genomic  profiling).

appropriate specialist approximately every  4 cycles/ 16 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment and a final assessm ent  <30 days after the last dose of 
study treatment.  For those  subjects  who have already received 2 or more doses of study drug, the exam  should be repeated at the subject ’s next visit 
and then approximately every  4 cycles/1 6 weeks  (± 7 days)  according t o the schedule from first dose (Cycle 1 Day1).  Investigators should solicit 
subjects regarding changes in vision, visual disturbance, or ocular inflammation at each scheduled study visit during tislelizumab  treatment.  For any 
change in vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be made for further management guidance (see Appendix 10 ).

 5.1.5 Phase 1A Part 3 : Flat Dose  Explorat ion 
The Phase 1A, Part 3 component will evaluate the safety and PK of tislelizumab  at flat doses 
(ie 200 mg, Q3W) that do not exceed the exposure of the MTD as determined in the Phase 
1A Part 1 study.  Approximately 10 to 20 subjects will be enrolled.  Tumor  types to be 
enrolled include but not limited to NSCLC, RCC, HNSCC, bladder cancer, melanoma, 
gastric, oesophageal, Merkel -cell carcinoma  and HCC . Other cancers that are deemed to be 
likely to benefit from PD -1 inhibition based on high mutational load, precl inical or clinical 
data from other studies may be considered for enrolment  subject to discussion with the 
Medical Monitor  in advance .  
This part of the Phase 1A study will be conducted in Australia and/or New Zealand sites only 
and may be conducted in parallel with a Phase 1B study that evaluates a RP2D selected based 
on the Phase IA, Part 1 and 2 data as described in Section 2.5.4 .  
5.1.5.1  Criteria for Stopping Phase  1A Part 3 
The doses selected for the flat dose exploration will have been evaluated for DLT and 
demonstrated as safe in the Phase 1A Part 1 study.  Nevertheless, to adequately monitor 
safety of subjects enrolled in f lat dose exploration, study accrual will be held pending data 
review by the SMC when at least 6 subjects have been treated and ≥33% of the subjects 
experienced a DLT during the first cycles consisting of 21 days  (as defined in Section 5.1.1  
of the protocol) .  A planned formal SMC review of safety data will be performed after all 
subjects  have completed first cycle (21 days)  of treatment, or withdrew due to any reason 
(PD, AE, or death) . 
5.1.5.2  Schedule of Assessment  
The schedule of events for Phase 1A Part 3 is presented in  Table 9 and the pharmacokinetic 
sampling  schedule is presented in Table 10.

 to Cycle 1 Day 1, and while on study approximately every 2 months in  the first 12 months and approximately every 3 months thereafter, and at the 
mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit. Analysis will be performed by the local study site laboratory w here feasible. If not feasible, tests will be  performed 
by a central laboratory.  
18. Tumor imaging (either CT or MRI, with preference for CT) will be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment, and while on study approximately 
every 9 weeks  in the first 12 months and approximately every 12 week s thereafter. The same imaging technique should be used in a subject throughout 
the study. After first  documentation of response (CR or PR) , imaging performed at the next regularly scheduled time point  will be used  for response 
confirmation. After patient ’s re-consenting, PD suspected as pseudo -progression needs to be confirmed  in a subsequent imaging at least 4 weeks 
later or at the next regularly scheduled time point before discontinuation  of study tr eatment . Subjects who stop treatment prior to 
documentation of PD will undergo repeated imaging for tumor response assessments during the study approximately  every 8 weeks or 9  weeks  
depending on dosing schedules in the first 12 months and approximately ev ery 12 weeks thereafter  until unequivocal PD is documented or the 
subject  starts new anticancer  therapies or subject  withdraws  consent  from the trial. This imaging schedule will be maintained and will never be 
adjusted regardless of any intermediate unsche duled scans.  Subjects who withdraw from the study for clinical or symptomatic deterioration 
before objective documentation of PD will be requested to undergo appropriate imaging to confirm PD.  Every effort will be ma de to confirm a 
clinical diagnosis of PD by imaging  (Section 5.2.5.2 ).  
19. Bone scans must be done for subjects with mCRPC  as described in Section 8.2.4 . For other subjects, bone scans at baseline or subsequent visits 
will be performed only if clinically indicated.  
20. Collection of archival tumor tissue for purpose of biomarker analysis. Written patient consent is  required for collection of archival tumor tiss ue. Specific 
instructions for tissue collection and shipment are provided in the Lab Manual.  
21. Archival tumor tissue  will be collected for purpose of biomarker analysis , although a fresh baseline tumor biopsy (within 8 weeks before  starting 
treatme nt) is str ongly recommended . In the absence of archival tumor tissues, a fresh baseline biopsy of a tumor lesion is  mandatory; for these  subjects, 
an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis after 2 cycles of treatment  (approximately C ycle 3 Day 1) is strongly recomme nded . Optional biopsy will also 
be taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who have confirmed disease progression during the  study  from accessible tumor sites to obtain 
samples to explore resistance mechanism . If feasible, any follow up biopsy  should be ideally taken from the same tumor lesion as the baseline biopsy. 
Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor biopsies . Fresh biopsies should be limited to readily accessible  tumor lesions ( eg, skin; peripheral 
lymph nodes; lung, liver or  internal lymph node metastases which can be readily accessed using CT guidance). If performed, a core or excisional biopsy 
of the tumor (cytologic or fine -needle aspiration samples are not acceptable) should be obtained that has proper size for histologic al examination and

 biomarker analysis ( eg, IHC of PD -1, PD -L1, PD -L2; genomic  profiling).  
22. Following completion of the treatment and Safety Follow -up phases of the study, every effort should be made to follow up all subjects for their survival 
status until  subject death or termination by the Sponsor.  
23. Ophthalmological examinations (such as eyesight /visual acuity , fundoscopy , slit lamp microscopy , and optical coherence tomography  [or equivalent 
diagnostic test] ) will be performed within 28 days prior to first  dose and at the end of week 9 (± 7 days ). Subjects will subsequently undergo repeat 
assessments by an appropriate specialist approximately every 5 cycles/ 15 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment and a final assessment <30 days after 
the last dose of stud y treatment.  For those subjects who have already received 3 or more doses of study drug, the tests should be repeated at the 
patient’s next visit and then every approximately every 5 cycles/15 weeks (± 7 days) according to the schedule from first dos e (Cy cle 1 Day1).  
Investigators should solicit subjects regarding changes in vision, visual disturbance, or ocular inflammation at each schedul ed study visit during 
tislelizumab  treatment.  For any change in vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be  made for further management guidance (see Appendix 10 ). 
24. Visit on Cycle 5 Day 22 is same as Cycle 6 Day 1.

or pancreatic cancer (approximately 50 subjects)  
For Arms 1, 3, 4 and 6, at least 20 subjects each will be enrolled from Taiwan or Korea.   
Enrollment rates will be dif ferent for each expansion arm.  Individual arms may be cl osed at 
the discretion of the Sponsor once the target number of enrolled subjects  is reached.  
Individual arms may also be closed prematurely due to difficulty in recruitment at the 
discretion of the Sponsor.   Subjects will receive tislelizumab  at the RP2D as described in 
Section 2.5.4 .  Each treatm ent cycle  will be 21 days in duration depending on selected dosing 
regimen.  Subjects will contin ue treatment until confirmed disease progression, intolerable 
toxicity, subject discontinuation/ withdrawal or at the discretion of the Investigator  in 
consultation with Sponsor . 
5.1.6.1  Criteria for Stopping Phase  1B 
To adequately monitor safety of subjects enrol led in the Phase 1B indication expansion, 
when at least 6 subjects have been treated and ≥33% of the subjects experienced a DLT 
during the first cycle consisting of 21 days (as defined in Section 5.1.1  of the protocol) , study

 3. Written consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol specific procedure. Results of a test performed as part of routine clinical management 
are acceptable in lieu  of a screening test if performed within the specif ied time frame ( eg within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1). Assign Baseline 
number when the study informed consent is  signed.  
4. Includes history of treatment for the primary diagnosis, including prior systemic, radiation treatment and surgical treatment . Date  of last prior cancer 
treatment must be  documented. Radiographic studies performed prior to study entry may be collected for review by the Investigator . Complete 
medication history for 30 days before the first dose (C1D1) of study  mediation needs to be reported.   
5. Vital signs to include temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure.  
6. Electrocardiogram assessments are to be performed with the subject in semi recumbent supine  position  and rested for 5 minutes.  Electrocardiogram (12 -
lead ECG) should  be performed at Screening  as baseline,  at the time of PK blood collection for PK (C max) within 30 minutes after the end of the first 
infusion of  tislelizumab , after infusion of tislelizumab  in every cycle (within 30 minutes after the end of infusion), and  at the mandatory Safety Follow -
up visit . Additional ECGs may be obtained if  clinically indicated  (refer to Section 8.2.3 ). 
7. Adverse experiences and laboratory safety measurements will be graded per NCI -CTCAE v 4.03. All adverse experiences, whether gradable by CTCAE 
or not, will also  be evaluated for seriousness.   After the first dose of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of their assessed relationship to study 
drug, are to be reported until either 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or the initiation of new anticancer ther apy, whichev er occurs first. 
Telephone contacts with patients should be conducted to assess immune -related AEs 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab regardless of whether or 
not the patient starts a new anticancer therapy. If patients report a suspected immune -related AE at a telephone follow -up contact, the investigator 
should arrange an unscheduled visit if further assessment is indicated. All drug -related SAEs will be recorded by the Investigator after treatment 
discontinuation until subject death or loss to f ollow -up, whichever occurs first.  
8. Routine laboratory tests ( eg, hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis) will be performed by the  local study site laboratory or their contract laboratory. 
Hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis may be collected up to 72 hours prior to any Cycle Day 1 dosing.  Of note, creatine kinase ( CK) and creatine 
kinase – cardiac muscle isoenzyme ( CK-MB) will be assessed as part of the serum chemistry panel (as per Appendix 2 ).  In the event  CK-MB 
fractionation is not available, please assess troponin I and/or troponin T  instead . 
9. PT/INR and aPTT should be collected at Screening and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit after discontinuation of study therapy. Coag ulation 
parameters should be  determined throughout the study when clinically indicated. PT/INR and aPTT will be analyzed by the local study site laborator y. 
10. Only in women of childbearing potential. Subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at scre ening (within 7 days before  the first investigational 
product administration).

next 6 months, then approximately every 6 months thereafter ; additional PK samples should be collected at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit. All 
trough samples should be drawn at the same time as blood collection for anti -tislelizumab  antibodies. Should a subject present with a DLT or any Grade  
3 or above immune -related adverse event (refer to Section 7.3.4 ), additional blood PK samples will be taken to determine the plasma concentration of 
tislelizumab . 
16. Only for subjects in Arm 2 that are  enrolled at Melbourne sites. Cycle 1  Day 1 : predose; Day 2 (approximately 24 hours after the first dose) ; Cycle 
2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1  at predose. Procedures for collection of samples are described in the Procedures Manual. PD -1 receptor occupancy assay 
will be performed in a central laboratory.  
17. Testing will be performed by the local laboratory at Screening. Include HCV antibody , HBsAg, HBcAb and HIV 1/2 antibodies.  Except for Arm 4, 
subjects who are HBsAg and HBcAb positive or HCV antibody positive at screening must not be enrolled until further definite te sting with HBV DNA 
titers  and HCV RNA tests can conclusively rule out presence of active infection requiring therapy with Hepatitis B and C respectively.  Subjects enrolled 
in the study who had detectable HBV DNA or HCV RNA at Screening should be tested for HBV or HCV viral load, respectively, eve ry 4 cycles (± 7 
days) throughout the stu dy, eg Screening, Cycle 5, Cycle 9, and so on (and whenever clinically indicated). For subjects who already received 4 or mor e 
doses of study drug, the viral load test should be repeated at the subject’s next visit and every 4 cycles according to the s ched ule from first dose (Cycle 1 
Day 1), and whenever clinically indicated. HCC subjects who test positive for HCV will not be discontinued. HCC subjects who test positive for HBV 
should be treated as per local guidelines at the investigator’s discretion.

15. Subjects who had prior liver transplant, allogeneic organ transplantation or bone marrow 
transplant ( BMT ) shou ld be excluded  
5.2.3 Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations  
To assess any potential impact on subject eligibility with regard s to safety, the Investigator  
must refer to the IB for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, 
contraindications, AEs, and other significant data pertaining to the investigational product 
being used in this study . 
Re-screening under limited conditions should be allowed after consultation with the Sponsor,  
eg when a subject narrowly misses a lab criterion and it’s correctable and not due to rapidly 
deteriorating condition or PD.  Re-screening is allowed only once.  
5.2.4 Subject Restrictions  
The following restrictions may affect subject participation in this study:  
 The Investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medications taken from 
the time of screening until the subje ct is discharged from the study  
5.2.5 Subject Completion and Withdrawal  
5.2.5.1  Subject Completion  
For Phase 1A , Part 1 , a subject will be considered complete if he/she has a valid PK profile 
(including data from Cycle  2 Day 1, predose or Day 29 predose for subject s who discontinue 
after Cycle 1 ) and has not withdrawn from the study prior to completing DLT period  
(28 days from first dose of tislelizumab ).  A subject will be considered complete is he/she 
discontinued study treatment due to a DLT with or without a valid PK profile.  
For Phase  1A Part 2 and Phase  1B, a subject will be considered complete if he/she has had at 
least one post -baseline  tumor  assessment for objective response.   Subjects who discontinue 
the study due to death or  clinical progression without a  post-baseline tumor  assessment will 
also be considered complete.  
Treatment with tislelizumab  may continue until one of the following events occurs:  
 Confirmed  disease progression  (refer to Section  8.5.1 ) 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 96 of 207 
  Unacceptable adverse experiences (see Section 5.1.2 ) 
 Need for >2 dose delays due to toxicity as per the dose modification guidelines  described 
in Section 5.1.2  
 Subject  withdraws consent  
 If in the opinion of the Investigator, a change or discontinuation of therapy would be  in 
the best interest of the subject  
 Subject  is lost to follow -up 
 Pregnancy in subject  
If a subject  discontinues from the study, the procedures will be followed as described in  
Section  5.2.5.2 . 
Subjec t reaches 24 months of treatment (measured from start of study treatment) :  
 Subjec ts may continue on study therapy beyond 2 years if the Investigator  considers this 
to be in the best interest of the subject  based on an  assessment of clinical benefit and 
potential risks.  Continuation of study  therapy beyond 2 years has to be explicitly 
approved by the  Sponsor , and will be contingent on the continued ava ilability of 
tislelizumab  drug product .  The study assessment and procedures schedule will remain 
the same.  
 If subjects have confirmed CR, PR, or SD after 2 years of tislelizumab , the treatment can 
be stopped if the subject wishes .  The decision should  be based on the I nvestigator’s 
evaluation , with the subject’s clinical benefit  and risk taken into consideration.  A 
treatment -interruption informed consent form  must be signed by subjects who stop 
treatment .  The Investigator should notify the Sponsor th at treatment will be stopped 
prior to the event .  In such a case, the study assessments and procedures will be 
performed every 12 weeks  (in conjunction with repeat radiographic imaging, as 
described in Section 8.5) rather than every cycle.   If a subject has evidence of PD within 
1 year of treatment interruption,  the Investigator can consider restarting tislelizumab  
therapy after discussion with the Sponsor, contingent on the continued availability of 
tislelizumab  drug product.  
 
5.2.5.2  Subject Withdrawal /Discontinuation  
Subjects/patients may withdraw at any time (consent withdrawal) or be dropped from the 
study at the discretion  of the Investigator  should an y untoward effects occur.  In addition, a 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 97 of 207 
 subject/patient may  be withdrawn by the Investigator  or the S ponsor (drug withdrawal) if 
he/she violates the study plan or for  administrative and/or other safety reasons.  The 
Investigator  or study coordinator must  notify the S ponsor  immediately when a subject/patient 
has been discontinued/withdrawn (drug withdrawal) due to an adverse experience.  When a 
subject/patient  discontinues/withdraws  (drug withdrawal) prior to study completion, all 
applicable activities sch eduled for  the final study visit should be performed at the time of 
discontinuation.  Any adverse  experiences which are present at the time of 
discontinuation/withdrawal (drug withdrawal) should be  followed in accordance with the 
safety requirements outlin ed in Section 8.3. 
The reason for discontinuation of tislelizumab  will be recorded in the electronic case report 
form ( eCRF).  These reasons include:  
 Withdrawal of consent  by the subject  
 Discontinuation of tislelizumab  by the Sponsor  
 Pregnancy  
 Any significant AE that compromises the subject’s abil ity to participate in the study  
 The Investigator  or Sponsor  determines it is in t he best interest o f the subject  
 Intercurrent illness  
 Treatment failure  
 Confirmed p rogression of disease at any time during the study  (refer to Section 8.5.1 ) 
 Need for  prohibited medication  
 Lack of compliance with the study and/or study procedures ( eg, administrati on 
instructions, study visits  
 Significant deviation from the protocol by the Investigator  without the consent of the 
Sponsor  
Subjects withdraw prior to docume ntation  of PD: 
Subjects who stop treatment prior to documentation of PD will undergo repeated imaging for 
tumor response assessments during the study approximately  every 8 weeks or 9 weeks  
depending on dosing schedules  in the first 12 months and approximately every 12 weeks 
thereafter  until unequivocal PD is documented or the subject  starts new anticancer  therapies 
or subject  withdraws  consent  from the trial.  This imaging schedule will be maintained and 
will never be adjusted regardless of any in termediate unscheduled scans.  Subjects who

 withdraw from the study for clinical or symptomatic deterioration before objective 
documentation of PD will be requested to undergo appropriate imaging to confirm PD.  
Every effort will be made to confirm a clini cal diagnosis of PD by imaging . 
6.0 STUDY TREATMENTS  
6.1 Description of Investigational Product  
Tislelizumab  is a monoclonal antibody drug which is formulated for IV injection in a single -
use vial (20R glass, U nited States Pharmacopoeia  type I)  containing a total  of 100 mg 
antibody in 10 mL of isotonic solution.   See Section 6.5 below for handling and product 
storage conditions.  
6.2 Product Preparation  and Admi nistration  
Tislelizumab  will be administered by IV infusion, using a volumetric pump  through an 
intravenous line containing a sterile, non -pyrogenic, low -protein binding 0.2 micron  in-line 
or add -on filter.   Specific instructions for product preparation and administration are 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
As a routine precaution, subjects who receive the first and second infusion of Tislelizumab  
must be observed for 2 hours after infusion, in an area with resuscitation equipment and 
emergency agents.  
Tislelizumab  will be diluted to a concentration  between 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL  up to 100 m L 
in sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) as described below .  For the 0.5 mg/kg dose, 
deliver first infusion over 60 min; if well -tolerated, second and subsequent infusion s may be 
administered over 30 min . For 2 mg/kg dose and above, along with flat doses, deliver first 
infusion (Cycle 1 Day 1) over 60 min; if well -tolerated, second infusion  and each subsequent 
infusion may be administered over 30 min  if 60 min infusion tolerated . Do not co -administer 
other drugs through the same infusion line.  
1. Slowly swirl solution in the vial. Allow up to 5 minutes for bubbles to clear. Do not 
shake the vial . 
2. Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to preparation. 
The antibody drug solution is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorl ess to slightly yellow 
solution  
3. Quarantine  the vial for investigation if extraneous particulate matter other than 
translucent to white prot einaceous par ticles is observed  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 99 of 207 
 4. Aseptically w ithdraw the required volume from the vial(s) of tislelizumab  into a syringe, 
and t ransfer into an IV  bag (If multiple vials are needed for a  subject, it is important to 
use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each vial  to prevent problems such as dulling 
of needle tip, stopper coring, repeated friction of  plunger against syringe barrel wall and 
so on) .  Visually inspect used vial(s) and quarantine the vial (s) for investigation  if 
extraneous particulate matter other than translucent to white proteinaceous particles is 
observed.  
5. Please use the following example to guide study drug preparation.  The total dose to be 
administered will be diluted to a total volume of not more than  100 mL in sterile normal 
saline (0.9% sodium chloride).  In case where the total volume is more than 100 mL, no 
additional dilution is necessary.  
Prepare tislelizumab  solution for infusion per the example provided below:  
For 2 mg/kg dose and assume subject  body weight of 70 kg (other dose levels and body 
weights can be calculated similarly):  
Total drug to be administered:    2 mg/kg x 70 kg =140 mg  
Drug needed for dose preparation:   140 mg / 10 mg/mL = 14 mL  
0.9% sodium chloride needed for dilution:  50 mL – 14 mL = 36 mL 
Target final concentration:    140 mg / 50 mL =  2.8 mg/mL  
For flat dose  200 mg : 
Drug needed for dose preparation:   200 mg / 10 mg/mL = 20 mL 
0.9% sodium chloride needed for dilution:  50 mL – 20 mL = 3 0 mL 
Target final concentration:    200 mg / 50 mL = 4 mg/mL  
The detail  of drug preparation is presented for reference in Appendix 4 . Site can adjust 
preparation process according to common practice in consultation with Sponsor . 
6. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion    
7. Visually inspect the final solution. If the infusion is not clear or the contents appear to  
contain precipitate, the solution should be quarantined  for further investigation  
(according to the instruction in Section 6.5) and documented on the Drug Accountability 
Log 
8. Recor d the time tislelizumab  was prepared on the IV bag label

 7.3.2 Infusion -Related Reaction s 
The symptoms of infusion -related reactions include fever, chills/rigor, nausea, pruritus, 
angioedema,  hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, 
dizziness or  hypertension.  Severe reactions may include acute respiratory distre ss syndrome,  
myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock.  Subject s should be  
closely monitored for such reactions .  Treatment modification for symptoms of infusion -
related reactions due to tislelizumab  is presented in  Table 12.  
Immediate access to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or equivalent environment and appropriate 
medical therapy (including epinephrine, corticosteroids, IV antihistamines, bronchodilators, 
and o xygen) must be available to treat infusion -related reactions.  Infusion of tislelizumab  
will be discontinued in case of Grade ≥2 infusion -related, allergic, or anaphylactoid 
reactions.  Following the first and second infusion of tislelizumab , subjects must  be obser ved 
for 2 continuous hours post -infusion for potential infusion -related reactions.  
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subject must be treated according to the best available 
medical care.  Subjects should be instructed to repo rt any delayed reactions to the 
Investigator immediately based on a complete guideline for emergency treatment of 
anaphylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council (UK ).

 CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction:  Immediately stop the infusion.  Proper  medical 
management should be instituted immediately, as indicated per type and  severity of the 
reaction.   This includes but is not limited to oral or IV an ti-histamine,  anti-pyretic, 
glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bro nchodilators, and oxygen.  
If a subject experiences a Grade 4 infusion -related reaction at any time, tislelizumab  must be 
discontinued . 
In the event of a Grade 3 infusion reaction, continuation of  study therapy is at the  discretion 
of the Investigator  after consultation with the Sponsor .  If continued, the infusion time of 
tislelizumab  in the  next cycle should be at least 1 hour.  Subject s should receive oral 
premedication  with an anti -histamine ( eg, diphenhydramine or equivalent) and an anti -
pyretic  (eg, paracetamol or equivalent), and in addition premedication with  
methylprednisolone 100 mg or its equivalent IV approximately 30 minutes before  start of the 
infusion.  Subject s should be closely mon itored for clinical signs and  symptoms of an 
infusion reaction.  
7.3.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu -Like Symptoms  
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subject must be treated according to the best available 
medical practice as described in the co mplete guideline for emergency treatment of 
anaphylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council (UK) .  
Subjects should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the Investigat or immediately.  
In the event of a systemic anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction  (typically manifested 
within minutes following administration of the drug/antigen, and characterized by: 
respiratory distress; laryngeal edema; and/or intense bronchospasm; and  often followed by 
vascular collapse or shock without antecedent respiratory difficulty; cutaneous 
manifestations such as pruritus and urticaria with/without edema; and gastrointestinal 
manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain, and di arrhea) , the infusion 
must be immediately stopped and the subject discontinued from the study .  
The subjects will be administered epinephrine injection and dexamethasone infusion if a 
hypersensitivity reaction is observed and then the subject should be placed on monitor 
immediately and ICU is alerted for possible transfer if needed.  
For prophylaxis of flu -like symptoms, a dose of 25 mg indomethacin or a comparable dose of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID ) (ie, 600 mg ibuprofen, 500 mg naproxen 
sodium) may be administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each dose of 
tislelizumab  IV infusion.  Alternative treatments for fever ( ie, paracetamol) may be given to 
subjects at the discretion of the Investigator.

 7.3.4 Immune -Related Adverse E vents  
Immune -related AEs are of special interest in this study.  If the events listed below or similar 
events occur, the investigator should exclude alternative explanations (eg, combina tion 
drugs, infectious disease, metabolic, toxin, disease progression or other neoplastic causes) 
with appropriate diagnostic tests, which may include but is not limited to serologic, 
immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data.  If alternative causes have b een ruled out; the AE 
required the use of systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, or endocrine therapy and is 
consistent with an immune mediated mechanism of action, the irAE indicator in the eCRF 
AE page should be checked.  
A list of potential irAEs i s shown below in Table 13.  All conditions similar to those listed 
should be evaluated in patients receiving tislelizumab  to determine whether they are immune -
related.  
Recommendation for diagnostic evaluation and management of irAEs is based on a recent 
European Society for Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) guideline ( Haanen et al , 2017 ) and 
common immune -related toxicities are detailed in Appendix  10.  For any AEs not included in 
Appendix  10, please refer to the recent ESMO guideline ( Haanen et al, 2017 ) for further 
guidance on diagnostic evaluation and management of immune -related toxicities.

Dose modification and management for irAEs are detailed in Appendix  10. 
If a toxicity does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, study drug should be 
discontinued after consultation with the Sponsor.  Patients w ho experience a recurrence of 
any event at the same or higher severity grade with rechallenge should permanent ly 
discontinue treatment.  
7.3.5 Hepatic Abnormalities  
Patients with advanced HCC generally have underlying cirrhosis with decreased hepatic 
function.  S pecial attention is needed because they may also have a concomitant chronic viral 
infection.  Therefore, when a hepatic event, such as liver function laborato ry abnormalities, is 
observed, the Investigator must evaluate for re -activation of viral hepatitis , consider other 
drug-related toxicity, and exclude PD involving the liver.  For diagnosis and management of

 patients with AST or ALT values ≥ Grade 1 at base line, please see Section 7.3.4  and refer to 
Appendix  10.  
In patients with Grade 2 AST/ALT abnormalities at baseline, therapeutic interventions with a 
steroid treatment may be required with rising AST and ALT labora tory abnormalities.  The 
following algorithm is proposed for the use of steroid treatment:  
 If AST or ALT increases by ≥ 50% relative to baseline and lasts for at least 1 week, start 
oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day and taper over at least 2 -4 weeks; re -escalate dose if liver 
function tests (LFTs) worsen, depending on clinical judgment (manage as per 
Appendix  10).  Study treatment should be held until AST/ALT increase 
resolved/improved to baseline and prednisolone tapered to ≤ 10 mg.  
 If any ALT or AST increases meets Grade 3 criteria, initiate steroid  therapy promptly per 
Appendix  10.  Study treatment will be held until AST or ALT improves to value 
≤ Grade  2.  Study drug may be reintroduced only after discussion with the Sponsor.  
 If any ALT or AST increases meets Grade 4 criteria, initiate steroid therapy  promptly per 
Appendix  10.  Study treatment will be discontinued permanently

OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
A signed, written informed consent must be obtained prior to screening assessments and 
before any study specific assessments are initiated.  The study specific assessments and 
procedures for Phase 1A Part 1  are shown in  Table 5, Phase 1A Part 2 are shown in  Table 7 
(Q2W) and  Table 8 (Q3W) respectively, Phase 1A Part 3 are shown in  Table 9, Phase 1B  are 
shown in  Table 11.  The PK sampling time points for Phase 1A Part 1 and Part 3 are 
presented in  Table 6 and Table 10, respectively .  
8.1 Demographic and Baseline Assessments  
Demographic data will include date of birth, race, height (in cm), body weight (in kg), and 
body mass index ( body mass index  in kg/m2).  For height and weight measurements, the 
subject will be allowed  to wear indoor daytime clothing with no shoes.  This data will be 
captured in the eCRF and database.  
Having given consent, subjects will be required to undergo a medical screen to determine 
whether they are eligible to participate in the study according t o the criteria listed in 
Section  5.2.  Screening assessments will be completed within 2 8 days prior to the first dose 
of the investigational produ ct.  In Phase 1B, s ubjects who are suspected or known to have 
serious/severe respiratory conditions or exhibit significant respiratory symptoms unrelated to 
the underlying cancer should undergo  pulmonary function testing which may include but is 
not limite d to spirometry and assessment of diffusion capacity done during the screening 
period to assist the determination of suitability on the study.  Screening assessments 
completed within 72 hours of administration can be used as Day  1 assessments as indicated  
in the schedule of assessment tables.  Please refer to  Table 5, Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9 
for Phase 1A , and Table 11 for Phase 1B .  The screening assessments for Phase  1A and 1B 
will include:

for a given tumor type)  
 Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), HCV antibody 
and HIV 1/2 antibodies  
 CT/magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan 
 Bone scan ( for patients with mCRPC as described in Section 8.2.4  or when clinically 
indicated)  
The above mentioned data will be  captured in the source documents.  Any results falling 
outside the normal range will be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator . 
The Investigator will obtain the patient's medical history at the Screening visit.  Medical  
history will include all active conditions, and any condition that are considered to be 
clinically significant by the Investigator.   History of treatment for the primary diagnosis, 
including prior systemic, radiation treatment, and surgical treatment will be recorded.  Date 
of and response to last prior cancer treatment must be documented.  Radiographic studies 
performed prior to study entry may be collected for review by the investigator.  Complete 
medication history for 30 days prior to the first dose (C1D1) of study  mediation  needs to be 
reported.  
Date of and response to last platinum -containing chemotherapy treatment for patients with 
ovarian cancer must be documented unless no platinum -containing treatment has been 
received before.  Subjects are defined as platinum -sensitive  if disease progression by 
RECIST or GCIG criteria had occurred more than 6 months after their last platinum 
chemotherapy, as platinum -resistant if disease progression occurred less than 6 months after 
their last platinum chemotherapy but after their post -treatment evaluation, and as platinum -
refractory if they experienced disease progression while receiving platinum chemotherapy, 
up to the date of their post -treatment evaluation.

 8.2 Assessments During Treatment  
Safety assessments should be performed at all vi sits to the study center and throughout the 
study.  The list of events and the time when they will be performed are presented in  Table 5, 
Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9 for Phase 1A , and Table 11 for Phase 1B,  respectively . 
8.2.1 Laboratory Evaluation  
Laboratory assessments should be performed at a local certified laboratory on Day  1 before 
the investigational product administration.  Laboratory assessments need not be repeated on 
Cycle 1 Day  1 if these assessments were completed for screening within 72 hours of the first 
administration.  Required laboratory assessments are listed in  Appendix 2 . 
Routine laboratory tests ( eg, hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis ) will be  performed by the 
local study site laboratory.  Subject  treatment and overall management decisions will be  
based on local laboratory data.   Details regarding the amount of blood drawn for laboratory 
testing are provided  in Appendix  3. 
Clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis will be performed at the time 
points specified in  Table 5, Table 7, Table 8, and  Table 9 for Phase 1A and  Table 11 for 
Phase 1B respectively .  In the event of neutropenia (ANC <1000/mm3), thrombocytopenia 
(platelets <50,000/mm3), or Grade 3 clinical chemistry toxicity, the relevant assessments will 
be conduct ed every other day until toxicity resolves to ≤Grade 2 toxicity.  If warranted, 
additional testing can also be done, or the relevant tests done more frequently in accordance 
with institutional guidelines.  All subjects who have any Grade 3 or Grade 4 labor atory 
abnormalities at withdrawal from the study  must be followed up until they have returned to 
Grade 1 or Grade 2, unless these are not likely to improve due to the underlying disease.  
On routine urinalysis, if urine protein is ≥2+ by dipstick, a 24 -hour urine sample for total 
protein and a random urine sample for total protein and creatinine will be obtained. Subjects 
should NOT be dosed until the result of 24 -hour urine protein  is confirmed.  If urine protein is 
>2 g/24 hours, the investigational product administration will be interrupted until it returns to 
≤2 g/24 hours.  If urine protein is ≤2 g/24 hours, further clinical evaluation and/or more 
frequent testing may be performed as clinicall y indicated.  A random urine protein to 
creatinine ratio can serve as a reliable surrogate for the 24 -hour urine protein when following 
subjects with urine protein of ≤2 g, documented by a 24 -hour urine collection.  In such cases, 
the 24 -hour urine for tot al protein should be repeated only if a clinically significant increase 
is observed in the random urine protein to creatinine ratio.

 8.2.2 Physical Examination , Ophthalmologic Examination , Vital Signs , and 
Hepatitis B and C Testing  
A complete physical examinat ion, vital signs ( systolic blo od pressure , diastolic blood 
pressure , pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate), and weight will be performed at the 
time points specified in  Table 5, Table  7, Table 8, and  Table 9 for Phase 1A , and Table 11 
for Phase 1B, respectively .  During the treatment period, symptom -directed physi cal 
examinations should be performed.  If there are no complaints and no abnormal findings 
from the previous visit for a particular organ system, a physical examination of that organ 
system is not required.  
To the extent feasible, blood pressure will be taken on the same arm throughout the  study.  A 
large cuff should be used for obese patients.  Subject s must be resting in a sitting  position for 
10 minutes prior to obtaining vital signs.  If blood pressure is >150/100 in a  subject  without a 
history of hypertension, or increased >20 mmHg (diastolic) from  baseline measurement in a 
subject  with a previous history of hypertension, the assessment  should be repeated in 
10 minutes for confirmation.  
Ophthalmological examinations ( such as  eyesight /visual acuity , fundoscopy , slit lamp 
microscopy , and optical coherence tomography  [or equivalent diagnostic test] ) will be 
perfo rmed at the time points specified in  Table 5, Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9 for Phase 1A 
and Table 11 for Phase 1B , respectively .  Eye exam, visual acuity test, and optical coherence 
tomography (or equivalent diagnostic test) will be assessed by an appropriate specialist at 
Screening.  Eye ex am, visual acuity test, and optical coherence tomography (or equivalent 
diagnostic test for retinal examination) captured as standard of care prior to obtaining written 
informed consent and within 28 days of randomization may be used for the Screening 
evaluation. Subjects dosed on a Q2W schedule will then undergo ophthalmologic 
examinations by an appropriate specialist on Cycle 1 Day 15 (± 7 days)  (Phase 1 A Part 1 
only) , Cycle 3 Day 1 (± 7 days), and thereafter every 4 cycles/16 weeks (± 7 days) during 
study treatment. Subjects dosed on a Q3W schedule will undergo an ophthalmologic 
examination  by an appropriate specialist  at the end of Week 9 (± 7 days ), and thereafter 
every 5 cycles/15 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment . Subjects in all groups  will 
undergo a final assessment < 30 days after the last dose of study treatment .  For those subject s 
who have already received 2 or 3 more doses of study drug, respectively,  the examination 
should be repeated at the subject’s next visit and then approximately either every 4 cycles/1 6 
weeks (±  7 days) for subjects dosed on a Q 2W schedule or every 5 cycles/1 5 weeks (± 7 
days) for subjects dosed on a Q 3W schedule, according to the schedule from first dose (Cycle 
1 Day 1).

 In addition, Investigators should solicit subjects regarding changes in vision, visual 
disturbance, or ocular inflammation at each scheduled study visit during study treatment .  For 
any change in vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be made for further 
management guidance (see Appendix 10 ).   
Subjects enrolled in the study who had detectable HBV DNA or HCV RNA at Screening 
should be tested for HBV or HCV viral load, respectively, every 4 cycles (± 7 days) 
throughout the study, eg Screening, Cycle 5, Cycl e 9, and so on (and whenever clinically 
indicated). For subjects who already received 4 or more doses of study drug , the viral load 
test should be repeated at the subject’s next visit and every 4 cycles according to the schedule 
from first dose (Cycle 1 Da y 1), and whenever clinically indicated. HCC subjects who test 
positive for HCV will not be discontinued. HCC subjects who test positive for HBV should 
be treated as per local guidelines at the investigator’s discretion.  
8.2.3 Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiograms will be obtained at the time points specified in  Table 5, Table  7, Table 8, 
and Table 9 for Phase 1A , and Table 11 for Phase 1B , respectively .  If prolongation of QT or 
QT interval corrected for heart rate ( QTc) is noted during the first 15 days (for Q2W 
schedule ) or 21  days (for Q3W schedule) of tislelizumab  treatment , ECGs will be performed 
weekly during the first cycle, and th en within 30 min after the end of every subsequent 
tislelizumab  administration, and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up visit.  
Significant QTc prolongation will be defined as  an interval ≥500 msec or an interval which 
increases by ≥60 msec over baseline.  Either of these conditions should be documented on 
two or more ECG tracings separated by at least 5 minutes.  The ECG tracing should be 
examined and a manual measurement by a  trained physician to assess the accuracy of the 
equipment being used.  
If a subject has significant QTc prolongation:  
 He/she will be withdrawn from the investigational product administration if the 
Investigator  and/or the medical monitor  determine the subj ect is at risk.  
 The subject will be monitored, treated appropriately, and closely followed (ECGs at least 
three times per week) until the QT and QTc interval return to within 30 msec of baseline.  
 The medical monitor will be consulted prior to administerin g further doses or 
re-challenging.  
The medical monitor will be consulted prior to administering higher doses.

 8.2.4 Computed Tomography  
A computed tomography ( CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis plus other relevant 
evaluations as appropriate, including bone scan for subjects with bone metastasis, will be 
performed to assess all known disease.  All known disease must be documented at baseline as 
target or no n-target lesions using RECIST  v 1.1.  The same method of assessment and the 
same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline 
and during follow -up.  The CT scan will be used for the evaluation of RECIST  v 1.1 by the 
Investigator  at each study center.  
Unless contraindicated, intravenous contrast product must be used to maximize visualization 
of all lesions.  Five millimeter (mm) contiguous scans at baseline and subsequent scanning  
approximately every 8  week s for Q2W and 9 weeks  for Q3W  in the first 12 months and 
approximately every 12 weeks thereafter (as calculated by the date of the first administration 
of the investigational product) until progression, with mandatory imaging coverage from 
thoracic inlet t o symphysis pubis should be performed.  Subjects who cannot tolerate 
enhanced CT due to increased risk of allergic reaction to iodinated contrast media  should 
follow local practice  to obtain diagnostic  quality images with an appropriate  imaging 
modality  and the same imaging modality should be utilized consistently . 
Technetium bone scans will be used to assess bone lesions.  In patients with prostate cancer 
baseline bone scans will be performe d during the screening window.  Repeat bone scans will 
be performed every 16 weeks (Q2W) or 18 weeks (Q3W) to keep with  the schedule of the 
CT scans.  Bone scan results will be reported as either no lesions or lesions present along 
with the number of bone lesions.  Disease progression by bone scan will be defined  per the 
PCWG2  criteria as presented in Appendix  9; progression is defined as 2 new bone lesions at 
the first ‘progression’ scan, confirmed by a subsequent scan at least 6 weeks later with the 
presence of 2 additional lesions.  
Subjects who stop treatment prior to documentation of PD will undergo repeated imaging for 
tumor response asse ssments during the study approximately  every 8 weeks or 9 weeks  
depending on dosing schedules  in the first 12 months and approximately every 12 w eeks 
thereafter  until unequivocal PD is documented or the sub ject starts new anticancer therapies  
or subject withdraws  consent  from the trial.  This imaging schedule will be maintained and 
will never be adjusted regardless of any intermediate unscheduled scans.  Subjects who 
withdraw from the study for clinical or symptomatic deterioration before objective 
documentation of PD will be requested to undergo appropriate imaging to confirm PD.  
Every effort will be made to confirm a clinical diagnosis of PD by imaging.  
Lesions that are expected to require palliative radiotherapy while in the study should not be 
included as target lesio ns, but should be listed as non -target lesions.

 8.2.5 Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs, regardless of the relationship to the investigat ional product, will be 
collected from signing the informed consent form and throughout the study.  
8.3 Safety Assessments  
Vital signs, weight, physical examinations , ophthalmologic  examination s, ECOG 
performance status, ECGs and  laboratory safety tests ( eg, PT/ aPTT, urinalysis, hematology , 
serum chemist ry, autoantibodies,  thyroid function, viral antigen reactions, cytokine / 
chemokine panels) will be  obtained and assessed at designated intervals throughout the study 
(see Table  5, Table 7, Table 8, and  Table 9 for Phase 1A , and Table 11 for Phase 1B , 
respectively ).  Special attention will be given to immune -related adverse effects ( eg, gut,  
skin, lung, liver,  kidney  endocrine organs, others).  
Adverse events will be graded an d recorded throughout the study according to NCI -CTCAE  
v 4.03.  Characterization of toxicities will include severity, duration, and  time to onset.  
Safety endpoints will include all types of AEs, in addition to  laboratory safety assessments, 
ECOG performance scale status, ECGs, and vital signs.    
The continuous safety evaluation will be performed by the Sponsor , the Coordinating 
Investigator , and Investigator s.  An SMC will be established for the determination of dose 
levels to be administered duri ng dose escalation and dose regimens in this study .  Details of 
the safety monitoring process will be specified in a dedicated SMC charter.  
8.3.1 Phase  1A Part 1  
The SMC consists of the Coordinating Investigator , selected recruiting Investigator s, the 
Sponsor ’s medical monitor , and the contract research organization  (CRO) ’s medical monitor .  
Ad hoc members will be consulted as needed and may include, but are not restricted to the 
biostatistician and pharmacokineticist.   
Before moving to the next dose level, the SMC will review all safety data available to 
determine whether recruitment to the next cohort should be initiated.  At the conclusion of 
the dose escalation phase, the SMC will determine the RP2D(s) to be further investigated.  
The SMC will determine when n o further dose escalation is appropriate and whether the 
MTD will be defined as a preceding dose or an intermediate dose.   
The SMC will meet for cohort safety reviews after all subjects in a dosing cohort have 
completed the first treatment cycle.  All ava ilable safety data will also be provided for 
subjects who discontinue prior to this time.  Safety data from prior cohorts may also be 
presented.  The decision to escalate dose and the determination of the MTD will be based on 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 118 of 207 
 the cohort safety reviews.  Th e SMC will review any protocol violations that may have 
impacted evaluation of potential DLT.  The SMC may weigh collective evidence and may 
determine a DLT for reasons in addition to those explicitly stated in the final protocol.  
Response from all SMC mem bers, including Investigators with subjects enrolled in the 
Phase  1 stage, or their designees, shall be required for each escalation/review.  
Adequate time for review of results will be given to SMC members (approximately 1 to 
2 business days).  Enrollment in subsequent dose levels will be put “on hold” during each 
review period, pending the decision of the SMC.  
The SMC decision points may fall into one of the categories detailed below:  
 Escalate to a higher dose  
 Recruit an additional 3 subjects into existing  dose level  
 Stop escalation and investigate lower dose(s)  
 End part of the study  
 End the overall study  
Decisions will be made using the criteria defined within the protocol (see Section  5.1.3.1 ). 
The SMC will make the dose escalation decisions . 
8.3.2 Phase  1A Part 2  and Part 3  
In order to adequately monitor safety during in the Phase  1A Part 2 and Part 3 stage s of the 
study,  data review w ill be routinely conducted by the SMC .  The SMC consists of the 
Coordinating Investigator , representative recruiting Investigator s, the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor, and the CRO’s  Medical Monitor.   Ad hoc members will be consulted as needed and 
may include, but are not restricted to the biostatistician and pharmacokineticist.  
The SMC will review safety data ( including but not limited to, AEs, SAEs, laboratory 
parameters, investigational product lo gs, treatment delays or reductions, and treatment 
discontinuation due to toxicity), when all the  subjects have completed the first cycle of 
treatment  in each stage , or withdrew due to any reason ( PD, adverse event, or death) .  The 
SMC will make the decisio n using the criteria as described in Section 5.1.4.1  (Part 2) or 
Section 5.1.5.1  (Part 3) .  Any treatment -related death will also trig ger review by the SMC.  
The SMC will determine whether it is safe to proceed.

 8.3.3 Phase  1B 
In order to adequately monitor safety during the Phase  1B stage of the study,  data review will 
be routinely conducted by the CRO and Sponsor medical and safety monitors.   Serious safety 
issues such as treatment -related death will be reviewed by the SMC .  The SMC consists of 
the Coordinating Investigator , representative recruiting Investigator s, the Sponsor’s medical 
monitor, and the CRO’s  medical monitor.   Ad hoc members will be consulted as needed and 
may include, but are not restricted to the biostatistician and pharmacokineticist.  
8.4 Follow -up Assessments  
All subject s have to be followed for at least 30 days after their last dose of study drug or  until 
initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment, whichever occurs first.   Telephone contacts with 
patients should be conducted to assess irAEs 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab 
regardless of whether or not the patient starts a new anticancer therapy. If p atients report a 
suspected  irAE at a telephone follow -up contact, the investigator should arrange an 
unscheduled visit if further assessment is indicated. All drug -related SAEs will be recorded 
by the Investigator after treatment discontinuation until patient death or loss to follow -up, 
whichever occurs first.  
Subject s who are discontinued from the study due to an unacceptable drug-related adverse  
event will be followed until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0 -1 or stabilization or until  
beginning of a  new therapy for their cancer, whichever occurs first.  
Subjects who stop treatment prior to documentation of PD will undergo repeated imaging for 
tumor response assessments approximately  every 8 weeks or 9 weeks  depending on dosing 
schedules  in the first 1 2 months and approximately every 12 weeks thereafter  until 
unequivocal PD is documented or the subject starts new anticancer therapies  or subject 
withdraws  consent  from the trial , whichever occurs first .  This imaging schedule will be 
maintained and will never be adjusted regardless of any intermediate unscheduled scans.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study for clinical or symptomatic deterioration before 
objective documentation of PD will be requested to undergo appropriate imaging to confirm 
PD.  Every effort will be made to confirm a clinical diagnosis of PD by imaging .  Following 
completion of the treatment and safety follow -up periods, all subjects will be  followed for 
survival status .  Subjects will have their survival status assessed approximately  every 3 
months ± 2 weeks by either a telephone or in -person contact until subject death or 
termination by the Sponsor.  With the exception of the collection of irAE data through 
90 days post -treatment  (as described above) , no other data ( eg subsequent thera pies, 
performance status  etc.) beyond survival will be collected during these calls/visits.

 8.5 Efficacy Assessments  
This study includes preliminary assessments of efficacy as outlined in the sections below.  
Disease assessment by radiographic imaging (CT or MRI, with a preference for CT) will be 
performed and recorded at screening  within 28 days before enrollment  and while on study 
approximately every 8 weeks or 9 weeks  depending on dosing schedules in the first 
12 months  and ap proximately every 12 weeks thereafter according to the RECIST Guidelines 
as shown in  Appendix  5.  The same imaging technique as used at baseline has to be used 
throughout the study.  
After first documentation of CR or PR, imaging performed at the next regularly  scheduled  
time point will be used for response confirmation.  
8.5.1 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression  
Patients must be re -consented to continue treatment beyond initial documentation  of disease 
progression.  
There is evid ence that a minority of subjects treated with  anti-PD1 therapies such as 
tislelizumab  may derive clinical benefit despite initial documentation of PD by RECIST  v 
1.1.  Pseudo -progression may occur due to immune cell infiltration and other mechanisms as 
manifested by apparent increase of existing tumor masses or appearance of new tumor 
lesions  (Wolchok et al, 2009 ).  These patients may go on to exhibit a partial response at a 
later time point. It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to determine if the patient should 
be considered for treatment beyond progression due to clinical benefit.  This decision should 
be considered carefully so as to permit patients who are likely to be benefiting to continue 
treatment while at the same time preventing prolonged exposure of a futile therapy in patients 
who may not be benefitting.  Any decisions to c ontinue treatment beyond initial progression 
must be discussed with the medical monitor  and documented in the study records .  
Thus subject s with documented progression in tumor burden or the appearance of new 
lesions in the absence of significant clinical deterioration (decline in performance status 
and/or laboratory values) are permitted to continue with treatment (after re -consenting  in 
Phase 1)  until confirmation of PD with repeat imaging  at least 4 weeks later or at the next 
regularly scheduled imaging time point .  The next imaging to confirm disease progression 
must  not exceed 12 weeks from initial documentation of PD . In addition , the following 
criteria  must be met:  
 Absence of clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including worsening 
laboratory values)  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 121 of 207 
  Stable ECOG performance status  
 Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical 
sites ( eg cord compression) that necessitates urgent a lternative medical intervention  
In rare cases, a subject with unequivocal  radiographical  PD may be allowed to continue study 
treatment  if, in the judgment  of the investigator, the subject is benefiting from the treatment.  
Prior consultation with the Sponsor is required .  
8.5.2 Efficacy Endpoints  
Efficacy measures  include:  
 The ORR, defined as the percentage of subjects in the study whose best overall response 
was either CR or PR, as as sessed by Investigators  based on RECIST  v 1.1. 
 The PFS  and DCR (CR  + PR + SD) as assessed by RECIST  v 1.1; and CBR 
(CR + PR + durab le SD [SD ≥24 weeks])  
 DOR for responders (CR or PR)  
PCWG2 criteria  (Scher et al, 2008 ) may also be used to evaluate responses in patients with 
prostate can cer enrolled in the study as presented in  Appendix  9. 
GCIG criteria  (Rustin et al, 2011 ), in addition  to RECIST v 1.1 may also be used to evaluate 
response in patients with ovarian cancer  enrolled in the study.  
RANO criteria  (Wen et al, 2010 ) may also be used to evaluate response in patients with 
GBM enrolled on the study.  
8.6 Pharmacokinetics  
Blood will be collected to describe the PK profile of tislelizumab  for Phase 1A and 1B stages 
of the study .  PK analysis will include but is not limited to AUC 0-14 day, Cmax and T max, Ctrough, 
T1/2, Cl, and V d. 
Details concerning handling of PK serum samples, including labeling and shipping 
instructio ns will be provided in the Lab Manual.  The actual time each sample was collected 
will be captured to the nearest minute in the eCRF and recorded in the database.  
Blood samples (3.5  mL) for PK analysis will be collected according to the Lab Manual and 
serum will be separated and immedi ately frozen.  Samples must remain frozen in a freezer set 
at or below -70°C and in a box with dry ice during shipping.

 Prior to collection, the collection tube and serum storage tube must be labeled with the 
corresponding labels provided by the sponsor.  The labels must be placed along the length of 
the tube so they can be read easily.  Tape must not be used to secure the labels as the tube 
will not fit into the auto -analyzer test tube rack.  The labels are of high quality and will not 
peel off of the tube  even under extreme conditions.  
Samples will be shipped to the central laboratory where all samples will be analyzed for 
serum tislelizumab  concentrations using a validated method.  
8.6.1 Phase 1A Part 1  
Cannulation for blood sampling for PK in Phase 1A Part 1 st age will be performed.  PK 
samples should not be drawn from the infusion line or from the same arm of infusion.  Blood 
will be collected via the intravenous  cannula pre dose and at the time points specified in  Table 
6. 
Cycle  1 and Cycle 4  
For subjects in the dose-escalation  cohorts , 8 blood samples ( 3.5 mL each) will be collected

investigational product administration) and 0.5 (end infusion to 30 min) , 1.5, 6, 24, 72 (or 
96), 168 and 336 hours post dose (the 336-hour PK sample will be collected on Day  15 within 
1 hour before the investigational product administration ).  In addition, a post dose sample 
(end infusion to 30 min)  on Cycle 1 Day 15 will be collected.   
Cycle 2 and Additional Cycles except  Cycle 4 during the First 12 Months of Study  
Two blood samples ( 3.5 mL each) will be collected on Day 1 of each cycle at the following 
time points: pre dose (within 1 hour before the investigational product administration) and  
postdose (end infusion to 30 min ). 
Safety Follow -up  
One blood samples (3.5 mL ) will be collected at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit. 
Other Blood Samples  
Unscheduled blood samples may also be collected whenever any notable safety is seen, to 
evaluate if the observation is exposure related. Blood samples ( 3.5 mL) should be obtained, 
when possible, for analysis of serum tislelizumab  in the event of a DLT  or any Grade  3 or 
above irAE  (refer to Section 7.3.4 ).  The Investigator  must record the time the blood samples 
obtained and the time of the previous administration in the eCRF.

 assay will only be performed on subjects enrolled in Phase 1A Part 1 of the study in 
Melbourne area.  
PD-1 receptor occupancy assay  will only be performed in subjects enrolled in Arm 2 in 
Phase 1B stage  of the study  in Melbourne area .  PD-1 receptor occupancy on circulating 
T cells will be measured as an indication of target engagement.  30 mL of blood will be 
collected at the specified time points ( Table 11).  Details on collection of blood samples, 
processing, storage, and shipping details are provided in the Lab  Manual.  
Other pharmacodynamic biomarkers could include changes in tumor microenvironment, 
including but not limited to PD -L1 exp ression and TILs.  These are detailed in the following 
Section 8.9. 
8.9 Biomarker Assessments  
Tumor biopsy and plasma samples for the development of exploratory biomarkers will be 
collected as stated in  Table 5, Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9 for Phase 1A , and Table 11 for 
Phase  1B, respectively.  
The archival tumor tissues are mandatory for all subjects who consent to participate in the 
study and have available  archival tumor tissue samples , although a fresh baseline tumor 
biopsy (within 8 weeks before  starting treatment) is strongly recommended.   In the absence 
of archival tumor tissues, a fresh  baseline biopsy of a tumor lesion is mandatory . For these 
subjects, an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis after approximately 2 cycle s of treatment 
is strongly recommended.    
For Arm 2 (ovarian  cancer ), Arm 3 (gastric cancer) , and Arm 4 (HCC) of Phase 1B 
study, a fresh baseline biopsy within 8 weeks before  starting treatment is mandatory for 
biomarker analysis  
For Arm 9 (melanoma) of Phase 1B study, a fresh baseline biopsy within 8 weeks before  
starting treatment and one approximately o n Cycle 3 Day 1 are mandatory for 
biomarker analysis.  
All other subjects who have easily accessible  lesions are strongly recommended for 
baseline or the paired biopsy.  
Optional biopsy will also be taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who ha ve 
confirmed disease progression during the study from accessible tumor sites to obtain samples 
to explore resistance mechanism.  If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally taken 
from the same tumor lesion as the baseline biopsy.  Written patient consent is required for 
fresh tumor biopsies.  Fresh biopsies should be limited to readily accessible tumor lesions

 (eg, skin; peripheral lymph nodes; lung, liver or internal lymph node metastases which can be 
readily accessed using CT guidance).  Risk ass essment of tumor biopsy must be evaluated by 
investigators to ensure that only non -significant risk procedures ( ie, those procedures 
associated with an absolute risk of mortality or major morbidity of less than 2% based on 
institutional experience, biopsy location, and patient’s clinical status) will be performed for 
protocol -mandated biopsies . From the baseline biopsy or archived tumor tissue, either a 
formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded block with tumor tissue (preferred) or at least 10 unstained 
slides must be sent to the central laboratory. If performed, a core or excisional biopsy of the 
tumor (cytologic or fine -needle aspiration samples are not acceptable) should be obtained 
that has proper size for histological examination and bioma rker. 
Specific instructions for tissue /plasma  collection and shipment are provided in the Lab 
Manual.  The maximum amount of blood collected during the study is presented in  
Appendix  3.  
The primary biomarker objective is to as sess the relationship between PD -L1 expression  
levels , TILs in the tumor tissues  and anti -tumor activity of tislelizumab . 
Other candidate biomarkers which will be investigated in the study may include, but are  not 
limited to, the following:  
 PD-L2 expressio n levels  
 RNA and DNA profiling , including but not limiting to neo antigens , in tumor  tissue  
 Proteomics and cfDNA profiling in peripheral blood  
8.10 Appropriateness of Measurements  
All efficacy, safety and PK assessments used in this study are standard, ie, widely used and 
generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant.  
9.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
According to the ICH GCP Guidelines , 1996 , the sponsor is responsible for implementing 
and maintaining quality assura nce and quality control systems with written Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs).   
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling.   
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 127 of 207 
 The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
 Investigator meeting(s)  
 Local certified laboratories for l aboratory measurements and ECGs  
 Study center initiation visi t 
 Early stud y center visits post -enrollment  
 Routine study center monitoring  
 Ongoing study ce nter communication and training  
 Data  management quality control checks  
 Continuou s data acquisition and cleaning  
 Internal review of data  
 Quality control check of the final clinical study report  
In addition, the sponsor and/or the CRO  clinical quality assurance department may conduct 
periodic audits of the study processes, including, but not limited to the study center, study 
center visits, PK laboratories, local laboratories, vendors, clinical database, and the final 
clinical study reports.  When audits are conducted, access must be authorized  for all 
study - related documents including medical history and concomitant medication 
documentation to authorized Sponsor’s representatives and regulatory authorities.  
9.1 Monitoring  
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor procedures, the Sponsor has 
engaged the services of a CRO to perform all monitoring functions within this clinical study.  
Monitors will work in accordance with the Sponsor or CRO SOPs and have the same rights 
and responsibilities as monitors from the Sponsor’s organizati on.  Monitors will establish and 
maintain regular contact between the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
During these contacts, the monitor will:  
 Check the progress of the study  
 Review study data collected  
 Condu ct source document verification  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 128 of 207 
  Identify any issu es and address their resolution  
This will be done in order to verify that the:  
 Data are authentic, accurate, and comp lete 
 Safety and rights of subjects are being protected  
 Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol (and any 
amendm ents), GCP, and all app licable regulatory requirements  
The Investigator  agrees to allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents and to 
allocate his/her time and the time of his/her personnel to the monitor to discuss findings and 
any relevant i ssues.  
At study closure, monitors will also conduct all activities described in Section 13.1.  
9.2 Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of 
the data management and biostatistics departments of Quintiles.  
An electro nic data capture (EDC) system will be used for this study, meaning that all eCRF 
data will be entered in electronic forms at the study center.  Data collection will be completed 
by authorized study center personnel designated by the Investigator .  Appropri ate training 
and security measures will be completed with the Investigator  and all authorized study center 
personnel prior to the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any 
subjects.  
The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations on the subjects participating in the 
study.  Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as possible during or after the 
subject’s visit.  To avoid inter -observer variability, every effort should be made to ensure that 
the same individual  who made the initial baseline determinations completes all safety 
evaluations.  The Investigator  must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and 
correct.  If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available or not 
applicable or unknown, the Investigator  should indicate this in the eCRF.  The Investigator  
will be required to electronically sign off on the clinical data.   
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency.  
The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no 
discrepancies between critical data.  All entries, corrections, and alterations are to be made 
by the responsible Investigator  or his/her designee.  The monitor cannot enter data in the  
eCRFs.  Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 129 of 207 
 to the data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the 
person who performed the change, together with time and date will b e logged.  Roles and 
rights of the study center personnel responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF 
will be determined in advance.  If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor 
or data manager will raise a query in the EDC a pplication.  The appropriate study center 
personnel will answer queries sent to the Investigator . 
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified.  Source do cuments are all documents 
used by the Investigator  or hospital that relate to the subject’s medical history, that verify the 
existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria and all records covering the 
subject’s participation in the study.  They include laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, 
pharmacy dispensing records, subject files, etc.  
The Investigator  is responsible for maintaining source documents.  These will be made 
available for inspection by the study monitor at each monitoring v isit.  The Investigator  must 
submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives the investigational product, 
regardless of the duration.  All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as 
laboratory or hospital records, should be clearly ide ntified with the study and subject number.  
Any personal information, including subject name, should be removed or rendered illegible 
to preserve individual confidentiality.  
Electronic CRF records will be automatically appended with the identification of t he creator, 
by means of their unique User ID.  Specified records will be electronically signed by the 
Investigator  to document his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are 
accurate.  This will be facilitated by means of the Investigator ’s unique User ID and 
password; date and time stamps will be added automatically at the time of the electronic 
signature.  If an entry on an eCRF requires change, the correction should be made in 
accordance with the relevant software procedures.  All chang es will be fully recorded in a 
protected audit trail, and a reason for the change will be required.  
Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Concomitant medications will be coded  using the World 
Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD).  Concomitant diseases/medical history 
will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA.  
9.3 Quality Assurance  Audit  
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, t he Sponsor  may 
conduct a quality assurance audit.  Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory 
inspection of this study.  Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 130 of 207 
 completion of the study.  If an audit or inspection occurs, the Investigator  and institution 
agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate 
his/her time and the time of his/her personnel to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and 
any relevant issues.  
10.0 SAFETY MONITORING A ND REPORTING  
The Investigator  is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  During the study, when 
there is a safety evaluation, the Investigator  or study center personnel will be responsible for 
detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol.  
10.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, temporally 
associated wit h the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associa ted with the 
use of an investigational product.  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication under 
study.  See Section 10.3 for additional information.  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency an d/or intensity of the condition  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after inves tigational product administration even 
though it may have been present  before the start of the study  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequ elae of a suspected interaction  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigat ional product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should no t be 
reported as an AE or SAE)  
 Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action.  See Section 10.3 for 
additional information  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 131 of 207 
 Examples of an AE do not include:  
 Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is an AE  
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
conve nience admission to a hospital)  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
 The disease/disorder being studied,  or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expec ted for the subject’s 
condition  
10.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 Results in d eath 
 Is life -threatening  
NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, i f it were more severe.  
 Requires hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization  
NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject was admitted (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
out-patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs.  If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria , the event is 
serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an  AE. 
 Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively

Page 132 of 207 
 minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Medically  Significant:  A m edical or scientific judgment regarding that the event , such as 
important medical events t hat may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospital admission  but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgic al 
intervention (in the office or an Emergency Department visit with treatment) to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition s.  These should also be 
considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, inte nsive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
10.3 Lack of Efficacy  
“Lack of efficacy” will not be reported as a n AE.  The signs and symptoms or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the AE or SAE 
definition (including clarifications).  
10.4 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal 
Assessments as Adverse Events or S erious Adverse Events  
Abnormal laboratory findings ( eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis) or 
other abnormal assessments ( eg, ECGs, X -rays, vital signs, etc.) that are judged by the 
Investigator  as clinically significant will be reco rded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the 
definition of an AE, as defined in Section 10.1, or an SAE, as defined in Section 10.2.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the 
start of the study or require a medical intervention for treatment will be reported as AEs or 
SAEs.  However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal 
assessments that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the 
Investigator  as more severe than expected for the subject’ s condition, or that are present or 
detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
The Investigator  will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or othe r abnormal assessment is clinically significant.

 10.5 Time Period, Frequency, and Method of Detecting Adverse Events 
and Serious Adverse Events  
Subjects will be assessed for AEs and SAEs beginning immediately after signing the 
informed consent form and continuing through to follow -up which is 30 ± 3 days of last dose 
of investigation al drug. Telephone contacts with patients should be conducted to assess irAEs 
90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab regardless of whether or not the patient starts a ne w 
anticancer therapy. If patients report a suspected immune -related AE at a telephone 
follow -up contact, the investigator should arrange an unscheduled visit if further assessment 
is indicated.  All drug -related SAEs will be recorded by the Investigator af ter treatment 
discontinuation until patient death or loss to follow -up, whichever occurs first . 
The Investigator  or designee will ask about AEs by asking the following standard questions:  
 How are you feeling?  
 Have you had any medical problems since your l ast visit?  
 Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the source documents.  All AEs and SAEs will be 
reported in the eCRF.  
10.6 Recording of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
When an AE or SAE occurs,  it is the responsibility of the Investigator  to review all 
documentation ( eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to 
the event.  The Investigator  will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or SAE 
in the eC RF.  It is not acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopies of the subject’s 
medical records to the Sponsor  or designee in lieu of completion of the appropriate AE or 
SAE eCRF pages.  However, there may be instances when copies of medical records fo r 
certain cases are requested by the Sponsor  or designee .  In this instance, all subject identifiers 
will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to the Sponsor  or 
designee . 
The Investigator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the 
AE or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. Adverse events are independent 
compo nents of the study.

 10.7  Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
10.7.1  Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator  will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study , at the time the event is reported .  When applicable, AEs  and SAEs should be 
assessed and graded based upon the NCI -CTCAE v 4.03.  In addition to performing the 
CTCAE assessment, the intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF should also be 
assigned to one of the following categories based on the Investig ator’s clinical judgment ： 
 Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities  
 Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities  
 Severe: An event that prev ents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as 
described in Section 10.2. 
10.7.2  Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator  is oblig ated to assess the relationship between the investigational product 
and the occurrence of each AE or SAE , at the time the event is reported .  The Investigator  
will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  Alternative causes, such as natural 
history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal 
relationship of the event to the investigational product will be considered and investigated.  
The Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or Product Information,  for marketed products, 
in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the Investigator  has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor  or designee .  However, it is very 
important th at the Investigator  always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior 
to transmission of the SAE eCRF to the Sponsor  or designee .  The Investigator  may change 
his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE eCRF  
accordingly.  The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements.  
The Investigator  will provide the assessment of causality as per instructions on the SAE 
eCRF.

 10.8 Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious A dverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
subject and provide further information to the Sponsor  or designee on the subject’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact  and are designated as ongoing, will 
be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  Once res olved, the 
appropriate AE or SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated.  The Investigator  will ensure that 
follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the 
nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional  laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  
The Sponsor  or designee may request that the Investigator  perform or arrange for the conduct 
of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  The Investigator  is obligated to assist.  If a subject dies 
during participation in the stu dy or during a recognized follow -up period, the Sponsor  or 
designee  will be provided with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on th e originally completed SAE eCRF .  The 
updated SAE eCRF  should be resubmitted to the Sponsor  or designee within the time frames 
outlined in Section 10.9. 
10.9 Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
10.9.1  Timef rames for Submitting Serious Adverse Events  
Serious AEs will be reported promptly to the Sponsor  or designee as described in  Table 14 
once the Investigator  determines that the event meets the protocol definition of an SAE.

 10.9.2  Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report  
Once an Investigator  becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a subject, he/she will report 
the information to the Sponsor  or designee within 24 hours as outlined in Table 14.  The SAE 
eCRF will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all  available details of the 
event.  The SAE should be recorded  by the Investigator  (or designee) and report ed to the 
Sponsor  within the designated timeframes.  The data alert letter will be automatically 
submitted to sponsor or designee immediately by EDC system.   If the Investigator  does not  
have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive additional information 
before notifying the Sponsor  or designee of the event and completing the form.  The form 
will be updated when additional information is received.  
The Investigato r will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report as described in Section 10.7.2 . 
In case EDC is down, f acsimile transmission of the paper SAE form  is the preferred backup 
method to transmit this information to the project contact for SAE receipt.  In rare 
circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is 
acceptable, with a copy of the paper SAE form  sent by overnight mail.  Initial notification via 
the telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator  to complete and sign the paper 
SAE form  within the time frames outlined in Section  10.9.1 . 
The contact information for assistance with SAE reporting, specific to the site, are listed in 
the investigator folder provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and 
the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the case report form documentation at the study 
site.  
10.10  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator  will promptly report all SAEs to the Sponsor  or designee  in ac cordance with 
the procedures detailed in Section 10.9.1 .  The Sponsor  has a legal responsibility to notify, as 
appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety 
of a product under clinical investigation.  Prompt notification of SAEs by the Investigator  to 
the appropriate project  contact for SAE receipt is essential so that legal obligations and 
ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other subjects are met.  
The Investigator , or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regul atory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory 
authorities and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)  /Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
This protocol may be  filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US 
FDA.  On ce active, a given SAE may qualify as an IND safety report if the SAE is both 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 137 of 207 
 attributable to the investigational product and unexpected.  In this case, all Investigator s filed 
to the IND (and associated INDs for the same compound) will receive an expedite d 
Investigator  safety report, identical in content to the IND safety report submitted to the FDA.  
Expedited Investigator  safety reports are prepared according to the Sponsor ’s policy and are 
forwarded to Investigator s as necessary.  Such a report is prepar ed for an SAE that is both 
attributable to investigational product and unexpected.  The purpose of the report is to fulfill 
specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
When a study center receives an initial or follo w-up report or other safety information ( eg, 
revised IB) from the Sponsor  or designee , the responsible person according to local 
requirements is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
10.11  Post-study Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
A post -study AE or SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE detection 
period, defined in Section 10.5. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former subjects.  However, if 
the Investigator  learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been 
discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably r elated to the 
investigational product, the Investigator  will promptly notify the Sponsor  or designee . 
10.12  Serious Adverse Events Related to Study Participation  
An SAE considered related to study participation ( eg, procedures, invasive tests, a change in 
existi ng therapy), e ven if it occurs during the pre - or post -treatment period, will be reported 
promptly to the Sponsor  or designee  (see Section 10.9). 
10.13  Pregnancy   
10.13.1  Contraception and Pregnancy Testing  
Childbearing potential is defined as being physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. 
Refer to  Appendix 12  for contraception guidelines and definitions of “women of childbearing 
potential” and “no childbearing potential.”  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening in women of childbearing potential.  
Any female subject who is pregnant will not be el igible for the study (see Section 5.2.1 ).  A 
urine or serum pregnancy test must be performed if any woman suspects that she has become 
pregnant dur ing the study.

Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 138 of 207 
 10.13.2  Time Period for Collecting Pregnancy Information  
The time period for collecting information on whether a pregnancy occurs is from screening 
until 30 days after the last investigational product administration.  Information on 
pregnancies iden tified prior to the investigational product administration does not need to be 
reported to sponsor.  
10.13.3  Action to be Taken  and Reporting  if a Pregnancy Occurs  
A subject who has a positive pregnancy test result at any time after the investigational 
product admi nistration will be immediately withdrawn from participation in the study.  All 
post-study assessments will be collected at the time of discontinuation as described in 
Section  5.2.5.2 . 
The Investigator, or his/her designee, will collect pregnancy information on any female 
subject or a female partner of a male subject who becomes pregnant while participating in 
this study.  The Investigator, or his/her designee, will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor  or designee  within 24 hours  of learning of a 
subject’s pregnancy.  The subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy.  Information on  the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
Sponsor  or designee .  Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 8 weeks following the 
delivery date.  Any premature termination  (spontaneous or elective abortion prior to 20 
weeks or stillbirth  after 20 weeks gestational age) of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE, as 
described in Section 10.6 and will be followed as described in Section 10.8. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as described 
in Section 10.0.  Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy and is 
considered reasonably related to the investigational product by the Investigator, will be 
reported to the Sponsor  or designee  as described in Section 10.11.  While the Investigator is 
not obligated to actively seek this information in former subjects, he/she may learn of an 
SAE through spontaneous re porting.

 11.0 DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERAT IONS  
11.1 Sample Size Considerations   
11.1.1  Sample Size Considerations for Phase  1A 
In the Phase 1A stage, the number of dose levels and schedules examined and the emerging 
tislelizumab  toxicities will determine the sample size.   It is an ticipated that approximately 
24 subjects will be required to establish the RP2D(s) of tislelizumab  when administered as a 
single agent.  In addition, 10  to 20  subjects will be enrolled in each of the schedule expansion  
and flat dose  cohort at one or more dose level (up to 10 mg/kg Q2W  or Q3W  in schedule 
expansion cohort; 200 mg Q3W in flat dose cohort ) not exceeding MTD to further evaluate 
safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of tislelizumab .  In total approximately 
120 subject s are planned for the study.  
11.1.2  Sample Size Considerations for Phase  1B 
In the Phase 1B stage, approximately 330 subjects ( approximately 20 , 30 or  50 subjects for 
each arm  except arm 9 ) will be evaluated  for efficacy as well as safety and tolerability of 
tislelizumab  in select tumor types.   One or more arms may be closed early due to difficulty in 
patient recruitment.  
Using binomial approach, the 95% confidence interval (CI) width of an observed ORR of 
10% is  reduced by  12%, from 30.5% to 18.5%, when sample size  increases from 20 to 50. 
The 95% CI width of an observed ORR=50% is reduced by 16 .6%, from 45.6% to 29.0%, 
when sample size  increases from 20 to 50.   There is approximately 88% chance to observed 
at least one responder in an expansion arm of size 20 when the underlying ORR is 10%; and 
such chance  increases while sample size expands . 
11.2 General Considerations for Data Analysis  
Data will be listed and summar ized using SAS® v 9.2 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
North Carolina) according to Sponsor  agreed reporting standards, where applicable.  
Complete details will be documented in the reporting and analysis plan.   Primary safety and 
efficacy analyses wi ll be conducted approximately 6 months after the last subject being 
enrolled.  
The following descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the trial data on the basis of 
their nature unless otherwise specified:  
• Continuous variables: number of non -missing  observations, mean, standard deviatio n, 
median, minimum, and maximum  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 140 of 207 
 • Categorical variabl es: frequencies and percentages  
• Time -to-event variables: number of non -missing observations (N), median, minimum 
and maximum. Kaplan -Meier (KM) event rates may also be  provided if applicable for 
specific time to event variables  
Efficacy and safety data will be summarized by stage and arm, unless otherwise specified.  
Further description of the statistical methods and analyses will be provided in the statistical 
analysis  plan.  
11.2.1  Analysis Populations  
All Subjects Enrolled Set (ENR)  
The all subjects enrolled (ENR) set will include all subjects who provide informed consent 
for this study.  The ENR analysis set will be used to summarize and describe the subject 
disposition, and deaths, unless stated otherwise.  
Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
The safety analysis set (SAF) will include all subjects in the ENR  set who receive at least one 
dose of tislelizumab .  The SAF will be used for all efficacy and safety summaries (except 
DLTs , PK and PD analyses ). 
DLT Analysis Set (DLT)  
The DLT Analysis Set includes all subjects who experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 plus 
subjects who received at least 90% of the planned doses of treatment during the DLT 
observation period (Cycle 1).   
PK Analysis Set (PKS)  
The PK Analysis Set will include subjects who have received at least the first dose of 
tislelizumab  and provided PK samples as per protoco l following first dosing on Day  1. 
PD Analysis Set (PDS)  
The PD Analysis Set will include subjects who have received at least the first dose of 
tislelizumab  and have evaluable pharmacodynamic data.  
11.2.2  Interim Analysis  
Phase 1A stage of this study is a dose escalation and schedule expansion study, safety, PK 
and pharmacodynamic data will be evaluated on an ongoing basis.  The interim analysis will 
be performed once the Phase 1A stage is completed .

Page 141 of 207 
 11.2.3  Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy is not a primary objective of the Phase 1A stage of this study.  Objective response is 
the primary endpoint of the Phase 1B stage.  There is no formal statistical testing for the 
efficacy endpoints in Phase  1B.  The efficacy analyses will be descriptive only.  
Response based on Investigator s’ judgment will be collected at screening and while on study 
approximately every 8 weeks  or 9 wee ks depending on dosing schedules in the first 
12 months and approximately 12 weeks  thereafter  in the simple form of four categories: PD, 
SD, CR, and PR (according to RECIST  v 1.1). 
PCWG2 criteria  (Scher et al, 2008 ) may also be used to evaluate responses in patients with 
prostate cancer enrolled in the study.  
GCIG criteria  (Rustin et al, 2011 ), in addition  to RECIST v 1.1 may also be used to evaluate 
response in patients with ovarian cancer enrolled in the study.  
RANO criteria  (Wen et al, 2010 ) may also be used to evaluate response in patients with 
GBM enrolled on the study.  
Listing of the data will be provided.  If data warrant, a summary by category will be 
provided.  
Objective Response  
The number and proportion of subjects who achieve objective tumor response (CR or PR) or 
SD will be summarized.  The ORR  will be determined along with 95% CI. 
Progression Free Survival  
Progression -free survival  is defined as th e time from the date of first study dose to disease 
progression or death whichever occurs first.  Subjects without an event (no disease 
progression or death) will be censored at the date of “last tumor assessment”.  Subjects with 
no baseline or post-baseline tumor assessments will be censored at Day 1. 
Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS and 95% CI.  Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be constructed to provide a visual description of the PFS change with time.  
Duration of Response  
Durati on of response for responders (CR or PR) is defined as the time interval between the 
date of the earliest qualifying response and the date of PD or death for any cause, whichever 
occurs earlier.  For subjects who are alive without progression following the  qualifying 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 142 of 207 
 response, DOR  will be censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment or last 
follow -up for progression of disease.  
Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate median time and 95% CI for DOR .  
Disease Control Rate  
The DCR is defi ned as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR, and SD based on 
RECIST v 1.1 in subjects with select tumor types.  The DCR will be calculated for each 
tumor type with 95% CI estimated.  
Clinical Benefit Rate  
The CBR is defined as the proportion of sub jects who achieve CR, PR, and durable SD [SD 
≥24 weeks] based on RECIST v 1.1 in subjects with select tumor types.  The CBR as well as 
95% CI will be estimated for each tumor type.  
Overall Survival  
Overall survival is defined as the time interval between t he date of the first study drug dose 
to the date of death for any cause.  Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate OS at 
various time points.  
11.3 Safety Analyses  
All subjects who are exposed to (or started receiving) tislelizumab  will be evaluated for 
safety.   Safety data will be summarized separately for the Phase 1A and 1B portions of the 
study.   
11.3.1  Dose Limiting Toxicity  
For Phase 1A, the number and proportion of subjects experiencing DLTs will be reported by 
dose level, based on  DLT observations du ring the first cycle.  The DLT A nalysis Set will be 
used for this analysis.  
There is no DLT analysis in Phase 1B.  
11.3.2  Adverse Event s 
The AE verbatim descriptions (Investigator’s description from the eCRF) will be classified 
into standardized medical terminology using MedDRA®.  All AEs will be coded to 
MedDRA® (v 18.1 or later) lower level term closest to the verbatim term.  All TEAEs will be 
summarized.  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 143 of 207 
 A TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date or a worsening in severity f rom baseline 
(pretreatment) on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days following study drug 
discontinuation or initiation of new anticancer therapy.  The TEAE classification also applies 
to irAEs that are recorded up to 90 days after discontinu ation from tislelizumab , regardless of 
whether or not the patient starts a new anticancer therapy.  The SAEs, deaths, TEAEs of 
Grade  3 or above, related TEAE s and TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation , and AEs 
of particular interest will be summarized.  
11.3.3  Laboratory Assessments  
Hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis values will be flagged as high or 
low relative to the normal range, where applicable.  Predose values will be used to ass ess 
laboratory shifts occurring at post dose.  A comparison of pre -study and post -study values 
will be performed to identify any parameter s that have not returned to pre -study levels.   
11.3.4  Electrocardiogram  
All ECG parameters including the QT interval corrected  for heart rate (QTc) will be listed for 
each subject and summarized by dose level and assessment time.  Change from baseline will 
also be summarized.  Relationship between dose level and QTc changes will be explored by 
graphs.  QTc will be calculated usin g Fridericia’s formula.  
11.3.5  Vital Signs  
Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory  rate, temperature and weight will be summarized and 
listed. The change from baseline will also be displayed.

Informed consent(s) will be obtained before the subject can participate in the study.  The 
contents and process of obtaining informed consent(s) will be in accordance with all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
12.4 Investigator Reporting Requirem ents 
As indicated in Section 10.10 , the Investigator  (or Sponsor , where applicable) is responsible 
for reporting SAEs to the IEC/IRB, in accordance with all applicable regulations.  
Furthermore, the Investigator  may be require d to provide periodic safety updates on the 
conduct of the study at his/her study center and notification of study closure to the IEC/IRB.  
Such periodic safety updates and notifications are the responsibility of the Investigator  and 
not of the Sponsor . 
13.0 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
13.1 Study and Study Center Closure  
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will conduct the following activities in 
conjunction with the Investigator  or study center personnel, as appropriate:  
 Return of all study data to the Sponsor  
 Data q ueries  
 Accountability, reconciliation, and arrangements for un used investigational product(s)  
 Review of  study records for completeness  
 Return of treatment codes to the Sponsor  
 Shipment of P K samples to assay laboratories  
In addition, the Sponsor  reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue 
this study either at a single study center or at all study centers at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, safety or ethical issues or severe non -compliance.  If the 
Spons or determines such action is needed, the Sponsor  will discuss this with the Investigator  
(including the reasons for taking such action) at that time.  When feasible, the Sponsor  will 
provide advance notification to the Investigator  of the impending action prior to it taking 
effect.  
The Sponsor  will promptly inform all other Investigator s and/or institutions conducting the 
study if the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, and will also inform the

Page 147 of 207 
 regulatory authorities of the suspension or te rmination of the study and the reason(s) for the 
action.  If required by applicable regulations, the Investigator  must inform the IEC/IRB 
promptly and provide the reason for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study  data must be returned to the Sponsor .  In 
addition, arrangements will be made for all unused investigational product(s) in accordance 
with the applicable Sponsor  procedures for the study.  
Financial compensation to Investigator s and/or institutions will be in accordance with the 
agreement established between the Investigator  and the Sponsor . 
13.2 Records Retention  
Following closure of the study, the Investigator  must maintain all study records in a safe and 
secure location.  The reco rds must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when 
needed ( eg, audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of 
data in conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and personnel.  
Where permi tted by local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records 
can be maintained in a format other than hard copy ( eg, microfiche, scanned, electronic); 
however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken.  The Investig ator must 
assure that all reproductions are legible, are a true and accurate copy of the original, and meet 
accessibility and retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required.  
Furthermore, the Investigator  must ensure there is an acce ptable back up of these 
reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for making these 
reproductions.  
The Sponsor  will inform the Investigator  of the time period for retaining these records to 
comply with all applicable regulatory req uirements.  The minimum retention time will meet 
the strictest standard applicable to that study center for the study, as dictated by any 
institutional requirements or local laws or regulations, or the Sponsor ’s standards/procedures; 
otherwise, the retenti on period will default to 15 years.  
The Investigator  must notify the Sponsor  of any changes in the archival arrangements, 
including, but not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, transfer of 
ownership of the records in the event the Investigator  leaves the study center.  
13.3 Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators  
When the interim clinical study report for Phase 1 and the final clinical study report is 
completed, the Sponsor  will provide the major findings of the study to the Investigator .

1. Standard tumor markers ( eg, AFP for HCC and CA 125 for ovarian cancer, as appropriate for a given 
tumor type) will be collected within 14 days prior to Cycle 1  Day 1, and while on study approximately 
every 2 months in  the first 12 months and approximately every 3 months thereafter , and  at the mandatory 
Safety Follow -Up Visit . 
2. Only for the dose -escalation subjects treated in Melbourne sites  due to sample and assay logistics. 
Blood in ACD will be collected and transported  at room temperature within 8 hours according to the 
instructions in the Lab Manual at the time points specified in  Table 5. 
3. Analysis of IgG and IgM at predose of Day 1 of every cycle in the first 1 2 months, approximately every 
8 weeks  thereafter, and at  the Safety  Follow -Up Visit.  
4. Blood for anti -tislelizumab  antibodies should be collected within 24 hours before start of Day 1 infusion 
every cycle in the first 6 months, every 2 cycles in the next 6 months, approximately every 6 months 
thereafter, and at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit. In subjects who dis continue study therapy before 
6 months, every effort should be made to analyze anti -tislelizumab  antibodies approximately 6 months 
after the first dose.  
5. Blood collected at predose on Day 1 of every  cycle until 6 months of study, and at the safety follow up  
visit for the subjects who have confirmed disease progression during the study to explore resistance 
mechanism.  
6. Cannulation for blood sampling for pharmacokinetics will be performed.  Blood will be collected via the 
intravenous cannula pre dose and at the time points specified in  Table 6.   
7. Unscheduled blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis may also be collected whenever any 
notable safety is seen, to evaluate if the observation is exposure related.  Blood samples (3. 5 mL) should be 
obtained, when possible, for analysis of serum tislelizumab  in the event of a DLT.   
Should a subject present with a DLT or any Grade  3 or above immune -related adverse event (refer to 
Section 7.3.4 ), additional blood PK samples will be taken to determine the plasma concentration of 
tislelizumab .

 APPENDIX 5:  THE RESPONSE EVAL UATION CRITERIA IN S OLID 
TUMORS (RECIST) GUID ELINES  
The text below was obtained from  Eisenhauer et al , 2009 . 
DEFINITIONS  
Response and progression will be  evaluated in this trial using the international criteria 
proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee 
(Version 1.1).  Changes in only the largest diameter (uni -dimensional measurement) of the 
tumor lesions are used in th e RECIST criteria.  Note: Lesions are either measurable or 
non-measurable using the criteria provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to 
measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
Measurable Disease  
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 10 mm by CT scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the slice 
thickness an d a minimum of 10  mm).  
 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when superficial).  
 20 mm by chest X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung).  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node mus t be ≥  15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5  mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small lesions (longest diameter ≥10 to 
<15 mm with conventional techniques or <  10 mm using spiral CT scan), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast di sease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable 
by reproducible imaging techniques are all non -measurable.  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 172 of 207 
 Bone lesions:  
 Bone scan, positron emission tomogra phy ( PET) scan, or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be 
used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with i dentifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of 
measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesio ns are non -measurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, 
by definition, simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesion s’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as 
target le sions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  T rial protocols should detail the conditions under 
which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2  lesions per organ and 5  lesions in total, should 
be identified as target lesions and recorded an d measured at baseline.  Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of 
all involved organ, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may 
be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  Pathological nodes which are defined 
as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion  of a short axis 
of ≥15  mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 173 of 207 
 sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a 
node is involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally  reported as 2  dimensions in the 
plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for 
MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital, or coronal).  The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis.  For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 
20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20  mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In 
this example, 20  mm should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological 
nodes (those with short axis ≥10  mm but <15  mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  
Nodes that have a short axis <10  mm are considered non -pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for a ll 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further  characterize any objective 
tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified 
as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at  baseline.  Measurements are not required 
and these lesions should be followed as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression” (more details to follow).  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target 
lesions involving the sam e organ as a single item on the case record form ( eg, “multiple 
enlarged pelvic lymph node” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and 
never more than 4  weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to charact erize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging based evaluation 
should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed 
cannot be imaged but are accessible  by clinical examination.  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and P10  mm diameter as assessed using calipers ( eg, skin nodules).  For the case 
of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate  the size of 
the lesion is suggested.  As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 174 of 207 
 examination and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective 
and may also be reviewed at the end of the trial.  
Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clear ly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that  CT slice thickness is 5  mm or less.  When CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( eg, for body scans).  
Ultrasound: Ultras ound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation 
by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be 
used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following CR or 
surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, how ever, they must normalize for a 
subject to be considered in complete response.  Because tumor markers are disease specific, 
instructions for their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a disease specific 
basis.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA 
response (in recurrent prostate cancer), have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with 
objective tumor as sessment for use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer.  
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in 
rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ 
cell tumors, wher e known residual benign tumors can remain).  When effusions are known to 
be a potential adverse effect of treatment ( eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that a ppears

Page 175 of 207 
 or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and 
progressive disease.  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Evaluation of Target Lesi ons 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target les ions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.   
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on st udy).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to  qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short 
axis measurement recorded (measured in the s ame anatomical plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10  mm on study.  This means that when 
lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even if 
complete response criteria are met, since a  normal lymph node is defined as having a short 
axis of <  10 mm.  Case report recorded in a separate section where, in order to qualify for 
CR, each node must achieve a short axis <10  mm.  For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis 
measurement of the nodes i s to be included in the sum of target lesions.  
Target lesions that become “too small to measure”.  While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even whe n very small ( eg, 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or 
lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that 
the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as 
being “too small  to measure”.  When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on 
the eCRF.  If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded as 0  mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and is 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned (Note: It is 
less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size

 when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in t he retroperitoneum; however, 
if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5  mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default value is 
derived from the 5  mm CT slice thickness ( but should not be changed with varying CT slice 
thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore 
providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon 
measurement error.  To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual 
measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5  mm. 
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. When non -nodal lesions “fragment”, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion 
sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid 
in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have 
truly coalesced such that t hey are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in 
this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion”.  
Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in s ize (<10  mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing 
non-target lesions.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).  
When the patient also has measurable disease. In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of  
substantial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target 
disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of 
therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of one or more non -target lesi ons is usually not 
sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall 
progression solely on the basis of change in non -target disease in the face of SD or PR of 
target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the pa tient has only non -measurable disease.  This circumstance arises in some 
Phase  III trials when it is not a criterion of trial entry to have measurable disease.  The same 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 177 of 207 
 general concept apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measu rable 
disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non -measurable disease 
burden.  Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: 
if all lesions are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can  be applied when assessing 
patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden 
based on the change in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase 
that would be required to declare PD for measu rable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden 
representing an additional 73% increase in “volume” (which is equivalent to a 20% increase 
diameter in a measurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from 
“trace” to “large”, an incr ease in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may 
be described in protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy”.  If “unequivocal 
progression” is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  
While  it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the 
very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be 
substantial.  
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differe nces in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some 
“new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions).  This is 
particularly important when the patie nt’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  
For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic 
lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up trial in an anatomical location that was not  scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this 
is the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on trial has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered which reveals metastases.  The subject’s brain m etastases are considered to be 
evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new dis ease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan.  
While fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG )-PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 178 of 207 
 scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease).  New lesions on 
the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 Negative FDG -PET at b aseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
 No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site 
of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not 
PD. 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best respon se recorded from the start of the study drug 
treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  
On occasion a response may not be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols 
should be clear if post -treatm ent assessments are to be considered in determination of best 
overall response.  Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced before progression 
will affect best response designation.  The subject’s best overall response assignment will 
depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions.  Furthermore, depending on the nature of the 
trial and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.  
Specifi cally, in non -randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation 
of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the “best overall response”.  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known.  Best 
response de termination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT 
required: Best response in these trials is defined as the best response across all time points 
(for example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on 
last assessment has a best overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be best response, 
it must also meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline.  If the minimum time 
is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the subject’s best response 
depends on the subsequent assessments.  For example, a subject who has SD at first 
assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best 
response of PD.  The same subject lost to follow -up after th e first SD assessment would be 
considered inevaluable.

Note:  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and  the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size (<10  mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate 
progression should it be based on increase in size of the no des.  As noted earlier, this means 
that subjects with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.  
In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ‘NE’ time point assessments 
may complicate best response determination.  The analysis pl an for the trial must address 
how missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and 
progression.  For example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a subject with time point 
responses of PR -NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document objective 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 180 of 207 
 progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping trial therapy.  
Conditions that define “early progression, early death, and inevaluability” are trial s pecific 
and should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment 
periodicity).  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of complete response depen ds upon this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before 
assigning a status of complete response.  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a 
CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases  where a residual radiographic abnormality is 
thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease specific medical literature 
for the indication.  Ho wever, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.  
For equivocal findings of progression ( eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes, or necrosis  in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.  
CONFIRMATORY MEASUREMENT/D URATION OF RESPONSE  
Confirmation  
In non -randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR 
is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error.  This will 
also permit appropriate interpretatio n of results in the context of historical data where 
response has traditionally required confirmation in such trials.  However, in all other 
circumstances, ie, in randomized trials (phase II or III) or trials where stable disease or 
progression are the pri mary endpoints, confirmation of response is not required since it will 
not add value to the interpretation of trial results.  However, elimination of the requirement 
for response confirmation may increase the importance of central review to protect against  
bias, in particular in trials which are not blinded.  
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after trial entry 
at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6 weeks).

Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 181 of 207 
 Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smal lest 
measurements recorded on study).  
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable dis ease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomi zed trials, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum 
on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for ca lculation of PD).  
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in different studies and 
diseases.  If the proportion of subjects achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time 
is an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, th e protocol should specify the minimal 
time interval required between two measurements for determination of stable disease.  
Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as the progression -free survival are 
influenced by the frequency of follow -up after baseline evaluation.  It is not in the scope of 
this guideline to define a standard follow -up frequency.  The frequency should take into 
account many parameters including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity, and 
standard practice.  How ever, these limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint 
should be taken into account if comparisons between trials are to be made.

 APPENDIX 8:  GUIDELINES FOR SUPPORTIVE CARE  
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the  
treating Investigator including but not limited to the items outlined below:  
 Diarrhea: Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis  (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal  pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and  of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In symptomatic patients,  
infectious etiologies should be ruled out, and if symptoms are persistent and/or 
sever e, endoscopic evaluation sh ould be considered.  
o In patients with severe enterocolitis, tislelizumab  will be permanently 
discontinued  and treatment with systemic corticosteroids should be initiated at 
a dose of 1 to  2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or  less, corticosteroid taper should be started and 
continued over at least 1 month.   
o In patients with moderate enterocolitis, tislelizumab  should be withheld and 
antidiarrheal  treatment should be started. If symptoms are persistent for more 
than one week, systemic corticosteroids should be initiated ( eg, 0.5 mg/kg/day 
of prednisone or equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less,  
corticosteroid taper should be starte d and continued over at least 1  month.  
Regarding guidelines for continuing  treatment with tislelizumab , see 
Section  5.1.2 . 
 All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of  
clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should  
be substituted via IV infusion.  
 Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and  
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the admini stration of  
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice. Patients  
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake.  
 Anemia: Transfusions and/or erythropoietin may be utilized as clinically indicated  for 
the treatment of anemia, but should be clearly noted as concurrent medications.  
 Neutropenia: Prophylactic use of colony -stimulating factors including Granulocyte  
Colony -Stimulating Factor (G -CSF), pegylated G -CSF or Granulocyte Macrophage  
Colony -Stimulating  Factor GM -CSF is not allowed in this study. Therapeutic use of  
G-CSF is allowed in patients with Grade 3 -4 febrile neutropenia.

Page 188 of 207 
  Thrombocytopenia: Transfusion of platelets may be used if clinically indicated. 
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura should be ruled  out before initiation of platelet 
transfusion.  
 Anti-infectives: Patients with a documented infectious complication should receive  
oral or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by the  
treating Investigator for a given infe ctious condition, according to standard  
institutional practice.  
 Immune -related adverse events: Patients who develop a G2 or higher irAE ( eg, 
colitis, skin rash, hepatitis, uveitis, hypo - or hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, or any  
other), should be discussed immediately with the Sponsor . Depending on the type  and 
severity of an irAE, oral or intravenous treatment with a corticosteroid should be  
considered, in addition to appropriate symptomatic treatment of a given condition.  
 Infusion reaction: Infusion reacti ons may consist of fever, chills/rigor, nausea,  
pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash,  
vomiting, myalgia, dizziness or hypertension. Severe reactions may include acute  
respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarctio n, ventricular fibrillation, and  
cardiogenic shock. Patients should be closely monitored for an infusion reaction  
during and immediately following drug infusion.  
o In the event of a Grade 1 or 2 infusion reaction, reduce the infusion rate by 
50% for the entire remaining duration of that infusion. Proper medical 
management  should be instituted, as indicated per type of the reaction. This 
includes but is not  limited to an antihistamine ( eg, diphenhydramine or 
equivalent), anti -pyretic  (eg, paracetamol or eq uivalent), and if considered 
indicated oral or IV  glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bro nchodilators, and 
oxygen.  
o In the event of a Grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction, immediately stop the infusion.  
Proper medical management should be instituted immediately, as ind icated 
per type and severity of the reaction. This includes but is not limited to oral or 
IV anti-histamine, anti -pyretic, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bro nchodilators, 
and oxygen.  
o Regarding continuation of study therapy after an infusion reaction has 
occurred,  see the guidelines in Section 7.3.2 .

EVALUATION AND MANAG EMENT   
The recommendations below for the diagnosis and management of any irAE  are intended as a 
guidance.  This document should be used in conjunction with expert clinical judgment (by specialist 
physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer using immunological agents), and individual 
institutional guidelines or policies.  
Criteria used to diagnose irAEs include blood tests, diagnostic imaging, histopathology, and 
microbi ology assessments to exclude alternative causes such as infection, disease progression, and 
adverse effects of concomitant drugs.  In addition to the results of these tests, the following factors 
should be considered when making an irAE diagnosis:  
 What wa s the temporal relationship between initiation of tislelizumab  and the adverse 
event?  
 How did the patient respond to withdrawal of tislelizumab ? 
 Did the event recur when tislelizumab  was reintroduced?  
 Was there a clinical response to corticosteroids?  
 Is the event an autoimmune endocrinopathy?  
 Is disease progression or an alternative diagnosis a more likely explanation?  
When alternative explanations to autoimmune toxicity have been excluded, the irAE field, associated 
with the AE in the eCRF should be chec ked.

Radiographic appearance is often nonspecific.  Depending on the 
location of the abnormality, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage 
or lung biopsy may be considered.  Consult with a r espiratory 
medicine physician for cases of uncertain cause.  
Neurological Toxicity  Perform a comprehensive neurological examination and brain MRI for 
all CNS symptoms; review alcohol history and other medications.  
Conduct a diabetic screen, and assess bl ood B12/folate, HIV status, 
TFTs, and consider autoimmune serology.  Consider the need for 
brain/spine MRI/MRA and nerve conduction study for peripheral 
neuropathy.  Consult with a neurologist if there are abnormal findings.  
Colitis  Review dietary intake and exclude steatorrhea.  Consider 
comprehensive testing, including the following: FBC, UEC, LFTs, 
CRP, TFTs, stool microscopy and culture, viral PCR, Clostridium 
difficile  toxin, cryptosporidia (drug -resistant organism).  
In case of abdominal discomfort, consider imaging, eg, X -ray, CT 
scan.  If a patient experiences bleeding, pain or distension, consider 
colonoscopy with biopsy and surgical intervention, as appropriate.  
Eye Disorders  If patients experience eye inflammati on, blurred vision or other visual 
disturbance refer the patient urgently to an ophthalmologist for 
evaluation and management.  
Hepatitis  Check ALT/AST/total bilirubin, INR/albumin; the frequency will 
depend on severity of the AE (eg, daily if grade 3 -4; every 2 -3 days if 
grade 2, until recovering).  Review medications (eg, statins, 
antibiotics) and alcohol history.  Perform liver screen including 
Hepatitis A/B/C serology, Hepatitis E PCR and assess 
anti-ANA/SMA/LKM/SLA/LP/LCI, iron studies.  Consider imag ing, 
eg, ultrasound scan for metastases or thromboembolism.  Consult with 
a hepatologist and consider liver biopsy.  
Renal toxicity  Review hydration status, and medication history.  Test and culture 
urine.  Consider renal ultrasound scan, protein assessme nt 
(dipstick/24 -hour urine collection), or phase -contrast microscopy.  
Refer to nephrology for further management assistance.  
Dermatology  Consider other causes by conducting a physical examination, consider 
dermatology referral for skin biopsy . 
Joint or  muscle 
inflammation  Conduct musculoskeletal history and perform complete 
musculoskeletal examination. Consider joint X -ray and other imaging

Treatment of Immune -Related Adverse Events  
 Immune -related AEs can escalate quickly; study treatment interruption, close 
monitoring, timely diagnostic work -up and treatment inte rvention, as appropriate, 
with patients is required  
 Immune -related AEs should improve promptly after introduction of 
immunosuppressive therapy.  If this does not occur, review the diagnosis, seek further 
specialist advice and contact the study medical moni tor 
 For some grade 3 toxicities that resolve quickly, rechallenge with study drug may be 
considered if there is evidence of a clinical response to study treatment, after 
consultation with the study medical monitor  
 Steroid dosages in the table below are for  oral or intravenous (methyl)prednisolone.  
Equivalent dosages of other corticosteroids can be substituted.  For steroid -refractory 
irAEs, consider use of steroid -sparing agents (eg, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF])  
 Consider prophylactic antibiotics for opport unistic infections if the patient is 
receiving long -term immunosuppressive therapy

 APPENDIX 11:  NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION FUNCTIONAL 
CLASSIFICATION  
Class  Symptoms  
I No limitation of physical activity.  Ordinary physical activity does not 
cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).  
II Slight limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but ordinary 
physical  activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of 
breath).  
III Marked limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but less than 
ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.  
IV Unable to carry on any physical activi ty without discomfort. Symptoms of 
heart failure at rest.  If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort 
increases.

OF “WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL ”, “NO 
CHILDBEARING POTENTI AL” 
Contraception Guidelines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy 
testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control. These methods 
include the following:  
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation (transdermal , implants or subcutaneous or 
intramuscular in jections ) 
 Combined oral contraceptives (birth control pills) may be used, but only if a 
concur rent barrier method is employ ed 
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, or implantable)  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized male partner  (with azoosp ermia demonstrated by a post -procedure 
medical examination of the semen)   
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of exposure asso ciated with the study treatment)  
o NOTE:  Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method 
if it is in line with the patient’s usual and preferred lifestyle. Periodic 
abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), 
declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study d rug, and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Of note , barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) is not 
considered a highly effective method of contraception and if used, this method must be combined 
with another acceptable method listed above . 
Definitions of “Women of Childbearing Potential,” “Women of No Childbearing Potential”  
As defined in this protocol, “women of childbearing potential” are female patients who are 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant.  
Conversely, “women of no childbearing potential” are defined as female patients meeting any of the 
following criteria:

  Surgically sterile (ie, through bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy)  
 Postmenopausal, defined as:  
o ≥ 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months OR  
o < 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12  months AND with 
postmenopausal  
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration > 30 IU/mL  and all 
alternative medical causes  for the lack of spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months 
have been ruled out, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, 
hyperprolactinemia, etc.  
If an FSH measurement is required to confirm postmenopausal state, concomitant use of hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy should be excluded.

Protocol Template, Version 3.0   PREFACE  
The Clinical Intervention Study Protocol Template is a suggested format for clinical trials sponsored 
by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Investigators are encouraged to use this format, as 
appropriate, when developing protocols for their studies. Large multi -site observational studies will 
also benefit from this protocol template.  
Note that instructions and explanatory text are indicated by italics and should be replaced in your 
protocol with appropriate text.  Section headings and template text formatted in regular type should be 
included in your protocol document as provided in th e template.  
The goal of this template is to provide a general format applicable to all single - and multicenter clinical 
intervention trials (e.g., drug, surgery, behavioral, nutritional, device, etc).  
As you can see the version number and date are on the bottom of each page. When making changes to 
an approved and “final” protocol, please provide a summary of the changes, with the date, at the front 
of the protocol.

 1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
Grounded in the Reach -Effectiveness -Adoption -Implementation -Maintenance (RE -AIM) Model, this 
study will assess the implementation outcomes of the provider  delivered telehealth Palliative Care 
Consultation in Post -Acute Care (PCC -PAC) intervention for persons living with dementia (PLWD) 
and their care -partners newly admitted to nursing homes (NHs) for post -acute care.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
N/A 
2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Dementia is the fifth -leading cause of death in older adults1 and the majority of people with 
advanced dementia die in nursing homes (NHs).2 Miller at al reported that 40% of U.S. nursing 
home (NH) residents dying with advanced dementia received post -acute Skilled Nursing Facility 
(SNF) care in the last 90 days of life, and receipt of this care was associated significantly with 
poorer end -of-life (EOL) outcomes, including a higher risk of dying in a hospital, compared to 
decedents with dementia and no SNF care.3 SNF care is a Medicare post -acute rehabilitation service 
delivered in NHs focused on intense rehabilitation and disease -modifying ther apies. Regardless of 
life expectancy, use of post -acute SNF care typically precludes access to hospice services.  
Palliative Care (PC) offers an approach to improve care for persons living with dementia (PLWD) 
in SNFs.4,5 It incorporates symptom assessment and management and open communication and 
documentation of patients’/families’ goals of care and treatment preferences.6 
2.2 Study Rationale  
Research demonstrates that PC consultations are associated with improved health -related quality of 
life and lower symptom burden.7 Specifically, NH residents who receive PC consultations are 
significantly less likely to be hospitalized at the EOL compared with propensity -matched 
controls.8,9 Studies have shown that PC delivered to PLWD increases advance care planning10 
improves patient and care partner satisfaction,11 and reduces costs12 and acute care use.13, 14  
 
The evidence -based Palliative Care Consultation in Post -Acute Care (PCC -PAC) is a multi -
component non -pharmacologic, nurse practitioner provider delivered intervention designed to meet 
the needs of PLWD receiving post -acute care in NHs. Components focus on  assessing and 
managing symptoms; conducting and documenting goals of care conversations; and communicating 
needs, recommendations, and treatment preferences to the NH team members and primary care 
providers. PCC -PAC is well suited for telehealth delivery because care for PLWD often involves 
family care partners (e.g., caregivers, surrogate decision makers), many of whom are unable to visit 
inside the facility and thus rely on remote communication with providers.  
3 STUDY DESIGN  
Embedding complex interventions in NHs is challenging and requires addressing barriers to 
adopting new practices.5,15 Well -established guidelines emphasize the need for conducting carefully 
designed pilot pragmatic studies to address effective implementation (defined as acceptability and 
appropriateness, treatment fidelity, and implementation fidelity).16 
This single arm embedded pragmatic pilot clinical trial will provide data to assess the 
implementation outcomes of the provider delivered telehealth Palliative Care Consultation in Post -
 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0                                                                                                                                   3 
 Acute Care (PCC -PAC) intervention among 30 persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their care -
partners newly admitted to one nursing homes (NH) for post -acute care.  
To assess acceptability and appropriateness , we will engage approximately 10 stakeholders in a 
stakeholder engagement plan that include (1) PC providers ; (2) Social Work (SW) NH champions; 
(3) post -acute care unit nursing staff and providers (including medial directors); (4) NH leadership, 
information technology staff; and (5) a PLWD and their care partners in focus groups and one on one 
semi structured i nterviews via phone or videoconference. Before, during, and after the study, we will 
invite stakeholders  to join 8 -10 regularly scheduled meetings to discuss different aspects of the PCC -
PAC intervention and its implementation. Interview guides will be used to structure the meetings. 
Interview guides will be developed in an iterative fashion informed by the previous meetings and 
submitted to the institutional review board prior to being used. Note: a PLWD who receives the 
intervention will not be in the stakeholder engagement plan.  
To assess Treatment Delivery Fidelity  defined as providers  adherence to the PCC -PAC intervention 
protocol among 30 PLWD in 1 NH with 2 provider s. 
To assess Intervention Implementation Fidelity  defined as NH adherence to PCC -PAC 
recommendations among 30 PLWD in 1 NH with providers.  
PCC -PAC Intervention Structure: The PC  providers  conducts the structured PCC -PAC via 
videoconference or telephone. The communication component includes documentation using a 
standardized template that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) PointClickCare® and 
direct contact with NH team m embers and primary care provider. New visits last approximately 45 
minutes and follow up visits 20 minutes. Each PLWD and care partner receives at least 1 -2 visits; 
follow up visits depend on their ongoing ne eds but no longer than 30 days after new visit.  
 
4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Stakeholders (1) PC providers ; (2) Social Work (SW) NH champions; (3) post -acute care unit 
nursing staff and providers (including medi cal directors); (4) NH leadership, information 
technology staff; and (5) PLWD and their care partner(s).  
 
PLWD : 1) documented dementia diagnosis, 2) admitted for post -acute care; 3) age ≥ 60 years; 
4) if unable to participate in a conversation or lacking capacity to make healthcare decisions 
as determined by the NH staff/providers, a care partner who can act as a surrogate decision 
maker in the PCC -PAC.  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Stakeholders: PLWD who receives the intervention  
PLWD : All candidates meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from 
study participation: 1) planned discharge within 48 hours of screening, 2) currently receiving  
specialty palliative and/or  hospice care  
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Stakeholders : Stakeholders will be identified by the participating NH leadership. We will invite 
stakeholders by phone or email to join regularly scheduled phone or video conference meetings to 
discuss different aspects of the intervention and its implementation. Using  an interview guide we 
will conduct 8 -10, 1 -hour focus group and/or semi -structured interviews via phone or 
videoconference with different groups of stakeholders to encourage open communication and

 identification of challenges and facilitators that are unique to each group. We will conduct the 
stakeholder engagement plan with an alteration (verbal) of standard informed consent.  
 
PLWD screening/recruitment : With IRB and nursing facility approval, we will use a full waiver 
of HIPAA authorization to screen/recruit potential subjects. This pragmatic clinical trial involves 
minimal interaction between the research team and PLWD subjects; the PHI for identifying subject 
eligibility and contacting potential subjects is what is normally collected for usual clinical care by 
nursing facility social workers and consultants (palliative care nurse practitioners). Using the 
Electronic Health Rec ord (EHR), participating sites Information Technology (IT) personnel or 
nursing home staff will identify PLWD over 60 years of age on post -acute care admission to a 
participating NH by an ICD 10 dementia diagnosis. They will generate a roster of potentially 
eligible PLWD which will be automatically delivered to the facility social work (SW) cham pion via 
secure email 2x/week.  
 
PLWD enrollment:  We will request a waiver of consent with an opt -out option to enroll 
partipants.17 This is appropriate for IRB approved minimal risk interventions18 of evidence based 
best practices and is consistent with clinical practice because PLWD or their care partner can opt -
out of a palliative care consultation if it is not desired. In the PLWD and/or the care partner are non -
English speaking, we will make int erpreter services available and adhere to the nursing home site’s 
procedures for interpreters.  
We will maintain a deidentified screening log for ineligible candidate and for those who opt -out of 
PC consultation.  
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS   
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
The PC providers  conducts the structured PCC -PAC (Table 1) via videoconference or telephone 
with the PLWD and/or their care partner and the social work (SW) champion in the NH. The SW 
and PC providers  will set up a mutually agreed upon consultation day/time with the PLWD and/or 
care partner, within 5 business days of NH admission and follow up visits will occur no more than 
30 days later (if needed). The PC  provider  will access the EHR PointClickCare® for clinical data 
and documentation. In keeping with a p ragmatic trial, PC provider s and NHs will have some 
flexibility implementing the protocol and this will be reviewed during stakeholder interviews. 
Because the trial is pragmatic, we expect the nurse practitioners and nursing home staff may make 
adaptations to tailor the protocol to their local context. All adaptations will be tracked and reported. 
provider s and SWs also will provide feedback on the technical quality of the phone or 
videoconference via a technical quality form.  
The potential risks associated with study participation are minimal because the study focuses on 
evidence -based assessment and management tools. Most of the data collected for the study is 
information that is similar to that which is already contained in t he medical record. Patients who are 
able to self -report will be queried regarding their pain, function, and mood, but again, this 
information is not outside the realm of what is collected for clinical purposes.

5.4 Adherence Assessment  
We will assess Treatment Delivery Fidelity  to the 6 steps and corresponding content of the PCC -
PAC encounter protocol (Table 1) on a 20% random sample of (n=3 per provider ) by direct 
observation or an audio recording (with the provider  and PLWD/care partners permission). The PI 
will conduct monthly (or more often as needed) calls with the provider s who will present cases and 
discuss telehealth PCC -PAC encounter protocol issues or adaptations.  
We will evaluate Intervention Implementation Fidelity , defined as evidence of collaboration 
between the PC provider  and NH team members and primary care providers using a standardized 
chart audit tool. We will review the EHR PCC -PAC encounter note template and subsequent 
treatment/therapy orders and plan of care changes, and therapies actually administered in the 
medic al administration record and treatment administration record to assess whether the PCC -PAC 
was accurately ‘received’ by the participant. Tabl e 2 captures the ‘mechanisms’ of the intervention.  
We will use outcomes of the treatment delivery and intervention implementation fidelity 
evaluations to provide additional context for stakeholder interviews and learn about adoption, 
acceptability, and provider /SW or facility adaptation of the intervention.

 6.2 Description of Evaluations for the Intervention  
6.2.1 Screening Evaluation  
Screening  
PLWD : Using the Electronic Health Record (EHR), participating sites Information Technology 
(IT) personnel to identify PLWD over 60 years of age on post -acute care admission to a 
participating NH by an ICD 10 dementia diagnosis. They will generate a roster of potentially 
eligible PLWD. SWs will review the roster of potentially eligible PLWD with the PC provider 2 
times/week, including decision -making capacity, ability to participate in a goals of care 
discussion, and presence of care partner who can act as an LA R/surrogate if needed. The SW also 
will facilitate scheduling the PCC -PAC with the PLWD and/or care partner and supply additional 
clinical information if needed.  
Consent Procedure  
PLWD : We will seek a waiver of traditional informed consent for this study. A waiver of consent 
is permitted under 45 CFR provided the study meets the following requirements:  
• The research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects;  
• The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects;  
• The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration;  
• When appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation  
We will seek approval from the Institutional Review Board to conduct this pragmatic trial with a 
waiver of informed consent based on the following NIH Common Rule criteria: (1) palliative care 
consultation is standard of care and a low risk intervention; (2) the waiver will not adversely 
affect the rights and welfar e of the subjects; hospice/palliative care and telehealth consults are 
already being offered in this site and this trial seeks to increase the opportunity for PLWD and 
their surrogates to benefit from telehealth palliative care consultation, while not rest ricting choice 
to forego it because it is not offered (3) The research cannot be practicably conducted without a 
waiver of the requirement for informed consent; the trial will evaluate system -level 
implementation of an evidence -based intervention; requirin g prospective informed consent would 
introduce important selection biases greatly reducing the knowledge generated; and (4) to the 
extent possible, the subjects will be provided with pertinent information after participating in the 
trial.

6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
PLWD:  Despite seeking a waiver of consent, subjects still retain full autonomy over their 
healthcare decisions, including whether to participate in the telehealth palliative care consult. 
Subjects remain free to refuse the palliative care consultation and/or an y care or therapies offered 
as a result of said consultation.

7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  ** NOTE: THIS PROJECT REQUIRES SAFETY OFFICER 
(SO) OVERSIGHT RATHER THAN A FULL DSMB**  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis. 
In addition, the NIA -appointed SO will oversee all data and safety monitoring activities for this 
study. This SO will act in an advisory capacity to the  NIA Director to monitor participant safety, to 
evaluate the progress of the study, and to review procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of 
data, the quality of data collection, management, and analyses. Advarra IRB will conduct the 
ethical review required for the protection of human subjects.   
Refer to the NIA IMPACT Collaboratory Omnibus DSMB Charter for details.  
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
Safety reports will be provided directly to the SO and NIA PO by the study team at the intervals 
described below. The SO will report on the status of pilot studies they are overseeing at the NIA 
IMPACT Collaboratory DSMB meetings.  
 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0                                                                                                                                   10 
 For the pilot study, the frequency of DSM will proceed as follows: 1. Prior to the start of participant 
enrollment and data collection, the pilot study PI must submit a DSMP for approval by the SO 
and/or the NIA PO; 2. Four to six months after the initiati on of participant enrollment and/or data 
collection, the pilot study PI must submit a DSM report to the SO. This interim report will be 
reviewed by the SO to determine whether there are any human subjects or data safety concerns; and 
3. At the end of the p ilot study, the PI must submit a final DSM report to the SO.  
The content of the data and safety monitoring report will include: study status, subject descriptive 
demographics, any safety findings, actions taken, and plans to abate any potential risks identified 
during the course of the study.  
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE):  AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study 
participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the resear ch, 
whether or not considered related to participation in the research.  
• PLWD experiences inadequate symptom management or side effects from a therapy that is 
recommended by the PCC -PAC  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  SAEs consist of any  adverse event that results in death; is life 
threatening or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; 
requires or prolongs hospitalization; causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity; results 
in congen ital anomalies or birth defects; is another condition which investigators judge to represent 
significant hazards  
Because this proposal involves an evidence -based palliative care intervention provided by specialty 
trained Nurse Practitioners, no serious adverse events are expected to occur. However, the following 
may occur in persons with serious illness:  
 
• Death, Hospitalization, Change in clinical status  
7.3.1 Reporting Procedures  
Because this study involves minimal interaction between the research team and subjects, AEs and 
SAEs will most likely be identified through conversations with and reporting by clinical staff 
(provider s & SWs) who provide direct care to enrolled subjects. Regular, monthly meetings with 
clinical staff will include dedicated questions to elicit whether any possible AEs or SAEs may 
have occurred.  
 
AEs and SAE’s will be recorded by the PI, research assistant immediately and the research team 
will conduct an analysis and determination of 1) whether or not the adverse event occurred, 2) the 
seriousness of the adverse event, 3) likelihood that the adver se event is associated with the 
intervention/study procedures; and 4) if necessary, preparation of report to the IRB and other 
entities.  
 
Event  Action  
Participant experiences inadequate 
symptom management or side 
effects from a therapy that is 
recommended by the PCC -PAC  Primary care team will be advised to make therapeutic 
adjustments.  
Study team staff member completes alert form and 
provides to project manager and PI. A determination 
will be made by the person reporting the event, the PI 
 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0                                                                                                                                   11 
 and the study team jointly as to the extent to which the 
event is a consequence of the intervention.  
Study team staff member monitors series of events.  
Death  
Hospitalization  
Change in clinical status  Study team staff member completes alert form and 
provides to project manager and PI.  
A determination will be made by the person reporting 
the event and the PI jointly as to the extent to which the 
event is a consequence of the intervention.  
Monitor series of events in both groups to determine if 
rate is higher in the either group  
 
 
• All adverse events that are both serious (SAE) and unexpected (i.e., have not been previously 
reported for the study’s intervention) will be reported to the IMPACT Collaboratory  Regulatory 
and Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. 
Partha Bhattacharya), and the IMPACT Collaboratory SO (Dr. Madhuri Reddy) within 48 hours  
of the study’s knowledge of SAE.  
• The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data 
Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. Partha 
Bhattacharya), and the IMPACT Collaboratory SO (Dr. Madhuri Reddy) quarterly , unless 
otherwise requested by the SO.  
• All deaths will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Leader (Julie 
Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. Partha Bhattacharya), and the 
IMPACT Collaboratory SO (Dr. Madhuri Reddy ) within 24 hours  of study’s knowledge of death.  
• AEs will be reported per IRB policies and also to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data 
Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. Partha 
Bhattacharya), and the SO (Dr. Madhuri Reddy) at minimum every 6 months, or at a frequency 
requested by NIA and/or by the SO.  
Severity  
• Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type 
causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical 
evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant 
and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by simple therapeutic measures; 
moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning  
• Severe:  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating  
Relatedness   
• Definitely Related:  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
agent/procedure – i.e. an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the study intervention, follows a known or expected response pattern to th e suspected 
 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0                                                                                                                                   12 
 intervention, that is confirmed by improvement on stopping and reappearance of the event on 
repeated exposure and that could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
subject’s clinical state.  
• Possibly Related:  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
• Not Related:  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible 
temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study i ntervention and/or a 
causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
7.3.2 Follow -up for Adverse Events  
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during conversations with provider s/SWs.  
All AEs not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate form. Information 
to be collected includes event description, time of onset, qualified medical professional’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to (assessed only by those with  the training and authority to 
make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on 
study will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE.  
A study team member will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
study enrollment is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day 
of study participation.  Events will be followed for outcome  information until resolution or 
stabilization.  
7.4 Safety Monitoring  
An NIA IMPACT safety officer will oversee study safety monitoring. The Principal Investigator 
will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis. In addition, the NIA -
appointed SO will oversee all data and safety monitoring activities f or this study. This SO will act 
in an advisory capacity to the NIA Director to monitor participant safety, to evaluate the progress 
of the study, and to review procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of data, the quality of 
data collection, manageme nt, and analyses. Advarra IRB will conduct the ethical review required 
for the protection of human subjects.   
8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION   
Subjects remain free to refuse the palliative care consultation and/or any care or therapies offered 
as a result of said consultation.  Subjects may withdraw voluntarily from participation in the study 
at any time and for any reason. Participants should co ntinue to be followed for 30 days, with their 
permission, even if the study intervention is discontinued.  
If subject discontinued is due to an AE or SAE, every effort will be made to undertake protocol -
specified safety follow -up procedures. If voluntary withdrawal occurs, the subject will be given 
appropriate care under medical supervision until the symptoms of any AE resolve or the subject’s 
condition becomes stable.

 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
9.1 General Design Issues  
N/A 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
As this is a pilot clinical trial, the primary objective is to study the implementation outcomes to 
inform refinement of the intervention and modifications for a large -scale effectiveness trial. We 
anticipate 8 -10 stakeholders will be required to achieve an understanding of the acceptability and 
appropriateness of the telehealth PCC -PAC and 30 PLWD to assess intervention fidelity and NH 
adoption of the telehealth P CC-PAC.  
 
9.2.1 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
All PLWD subjects will be assigned to the intervention.  
9.3 Interim analyses and Stopping Rules  
An interim analysis is not planned.  
9.4 Outcomes

N/A 
9.5 Data Analyses  
Stakeholder Engagement : Interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim and managed and 
analyzed using NVivo 12.0. We will conduct initial descriptive data coding guided by directed 
content analysis techniques to describe the perceived most and least effective components of the 
intervention, barriers to implementation, and factors that facili tated the uptake, acceptance 
(adoption), and any adaptations of the intervention. We will then reorganize and condense coded 
data to compare similarities and differences and identify overarching categories. Categories will be 
grouped by their properties to  develop themes. The study team will meet weekly during analysis to 
discuss codes, categories, and initial themes. The team will maintain a comprehensive audit trail, 
including methodological and analytic memos throughout the project.  
PLWD : Intervention Implementation Fidelity (collaboration and implementation of findings from 
the PCC -PAC): Participating sites IT will provide deidentified reports to the study staff including 
each participants PCC -PAC notes and accompanying medical and treat ment orders in the EHR. We

 will quantitatively evaluate treatment delivery and treatment receipt using 90% adherence as a 
benchmark of success. Hospitalizations will be quantified for each participant  
10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
The project manager or research assistant will collect clinical and demographic variables for 
eligible subjects from the EHR.  
10.2 Data Management  
Study data will be entered and managed using NVivo 12.0 and REDCap (http://www.project -
redcap.org) which is a secure, web -based application. The University of Maryland is a member of 
the REDCap consortium and this application is freely available to consort ium members. REDCap 
provides: 1) an intuitive interface for data entry (with data validation); 2) audit trails for tracking data 
entry and changes; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common 
statistical packages, 4) procedures for  importing data from external sources; and 5) advanced 
features, such as branching logic and calculated fields.  
 
10.3 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1  Training  
To maximize quality control, the study team will be trained in all data collection and entry 
procedures. A designated team member will monitor data collection by checking completed 
data fields.  
Quality Control Committee  
N/A 
10.3.2  Metrics  
We will utilize double -data entry methods on a 10% random sample, with checks for 
discordant errors, and as data are entered into the REDCap system.  
10.3.3  Protocol Deviation  
Protocol deviations will be captured, documented, and reviewed by a member of the 
study team during interaction with provider s and SWs. The PI will monitor deviations 
and the team will review each deviation for its root cause and assess whether a 
modification to the protocol is needed. Of note: PCC -PAC Intervention protocol 
adaptations will be tracked using a standard form.  
10.3.4  Monitoring  
The PI will monitor protocol compliance and data quality monthly with the study team.  
11 PARTICIPANT RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
This protocol and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by the Advarra 
IRB who is responsible for oversight of the study.  
 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0                                                                                                                                   15 
 Consent Procedure  
Stakeholders:  will provide verbal consent for participating in focus groups or semi -structured 
interviews using a script. The stakeholder who is a PLWD will be read the script for verbal 
consent to participate in the focus groups/semi structured interviews. The PLWD wi ll then be 
asked what they understand about the purpose, the procedures, and the ability to refuse 
participation in the focus groups/semi structured interview at any time.  
PLWD : We will seek a waiver of traditional informed consent for this study. A waiver of consent 
is permitted under 45 CFR provided the study meets the following requirements:  
• The research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects;  
• The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects;  
• The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration;  
• When appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation  
We will seek approval from the Institutional Review Board to conduct this pragmatic trial with a 
waiver of informed consent based on the following NIH Common Rule criteria: (1) palliative care 
consultation is standard of care and a low risk intervention; ( 2) the waiver will not adversely 
affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; hospice/palliative care and telehealth consults are 
already being offered in this site and this trial seeks to increase the opportunity for PLWD and 
their surrogates to benefit  from telehealth palliative care consultation, while not restricting choice 
to forego it because it is not offered (3) The research cannot be practicably conducted without a 
waiver of the requirement for informed consent; the trial will evaluate system -level 
implementation of an evidence -based intervention; requiring prospective informed consent would 
introduce important selection biases greatly reducing the knowledge generated; and (4) to the 
extent possible, the subjects will be provided with pertinent in formation after participating in the 
trial. 
PLWD subjects will be informed by the provider/SW that they are receiving a clinical evaluation 
via teleheath to discuss goals of care, symptoms, and any unmet needs associated with their 
illness. As this is a pragmatic clinical trial and the PCC -PAC is be ing integrated into the routine 
and usual care delivery of PLWD, the SW will use the same approach they use for other usual 
care delivery activities in the facility that address goals of care, symptoms, and unmet needs. Any 
of which the PLWD/surrogate deci sion maker will be informed that they can decline at any time.   
INSERT HIPAA  
11.2 Participant Confidentiality  
We will keep all data confidential in accordance with state and federal laws. Data will not 
be linked to participant identifying name in the study database. Any data, specimens, forms, 
reports, or audio recordings, and other records that leave the site will be identified only by 
a participant identification number (Participant ID, PID) and stored in secure computer 
files and locked filing cabinets to maintain confidenti ality. All computer entry and 
networking programs will be done using PIDs only. Information will not be released 
without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by IRB, 
the FDA, the NIA, and the OHRP. The study team will d estroy the records at the earliest 
opportunity following data analysis and study completion.

Stakeholder subjects will be compensated $50 per focus group or semi -structured 
interview that they participate in after providing verbal consent for a total of 8 -10 focus 
group or semi -structured interviews over one year.  
Subjects will be paid following each completed visit or at the end of their participation in 
the research study, whichever they prefer.

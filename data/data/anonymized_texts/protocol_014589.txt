ABSTRACT: Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with the addition of a nasal cannula is a useful technique to pre-oxygenate and provide apneic oxygenation in hypoxic patients undergoing emergency airway management. This study aims to evaluate preoxygenation by quantifying end-tidal oxygen (etO2) concentration resulting from nasal cannula placement underneath a noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) mask. This is a prospective randomized cross over study of healthy volunteers undergoing continuous positive airway pressure ventilation via a noninvasive ventilation (NIV) mask with and without the addition of nasal cannulas. End-tidal oxygen concentration will be measured by an oxygen sensor following three minutes of NIPPV with and without the addition of a nasal cannula, with each subject serving as his or her own control.    3.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTION: The objective is to compare end-tidal oxygen concentration among healthy volunteers undergoing NIPPV with nasal cannulas versus without nasal cannulas. We hypothesize that the use of nasal cannulas during NIPPV will not result in a significant decrease (a clinically significant difference of 5%) in end-tidal oxygen percent compared to no use of nasal cannulas.  4.  MILITARY RELEVANCE: Effective means to improve oxygen saturations is critical during emergency airway management in any setting, including the deployed and austere environments frequently encountered by military medical providers.   5. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE.   Multiple pre-oxygenation techniques are utilized to provide safe intubation conditions during emergency airway management. In a subset of patients, standard techniques such as tidal volume breathing of high FiO2 source for three minutes or eight vital capacity breaths will fail to adequately pre-oxygenate and lead to early desaturation. Alternative pre-oxygenation techniques utilizing NIPPV or nasal cannula during the apneic period have been shown to benefit patients at risk for critical desaturation during intubation.1, 2, 3   Patients that fail to achieve oxygen saturations greater than 93% after tidal volume breathing from a high FiO2 source are at risk for critical desaturation during an intubation attempt4 and are likely exhibiting shunt physiology.5 Shunt physiology refers to the process wherein blood perfusing fluid filled or collapsed alveoli is not adequately oxygenated, and then mixes with oxygenated blood from the remainder of functioning alveoli, contributing to hypoxia. Augmentation of mean airway pressure by NIPPV can improve shunt physiology and increase oxygen saturation prior to intubation attempts. In a study by Baillard et al, hypoxic ICU patients pre-oxygenated with pressure support ventilation via facemask had higher mean oxygen saturation prior to intubation when compared to patients undergoing pre-oxygenation with non-rebreather (98% vs 93%). Additionally, patients pre-oxygenated via non-rebreather desaturated to much lower levels during the intubation compared to the noninvasive group (81% vs 93%).1   However, many NIPPV machines (mainly BiPAP machines) do not supply continuous flow of oxygen during the apneic period. Oxygen administration via nasal cannula during the apneic period can increase the time to desaturation. In a study comparing apneic oxygenation with nasal cannula at 5L/min to patients on room air by Ramachandran et al, patients placed on nasal cannula had significantly prolonged time of saturations above 95% (5.29 vs 3.49 min). Also, a greater number of patients with nasal cannula during the apneic period had saturations above 95% at the end of six minutes (8 vs 1).3

Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 2 of 6  The combination of both NIPPV and nasal cannula for pre-oxygenation and apneic oxygenation may be helpful to improve oxygen saturations during emergency airway management. Patients with shunt physiology requiring NIPPV to improve oxygen saturations prior to intubation will likely benefit from continuation of positive pressure during the apneic period.5 The addition of nasal cannula provides apneic oxygenation during the period between sedative and paralytic administration and initiation of laryngoscopy. Preplacement of the nasal cannula under the NIPPV mask prior to medication administration also allows immediate transition to laryngoscopy with continued apneic oxygenation. We have previously shown that the nasal cannula does not significantly alter NIPPV mask seal (manuscript in review). Prior studies have evaluated the use of nasal cannula under a Bag-valve mask and anesthesia circuit with mask, showing a small but not statistically significant decrease in end-tidal oxygen concentration. 6,7 In addition, this study differs from previous studies in that other studies have used 5 LPM7  and 10 LPM6 through the NC instead of 15 LPM which is the flow rate recommended by a commonly cited review article on pre-oxygenation for emergency airway management. 5 This study aims to evaluate the effects on end-tidal oxygen concentration utilizing NIPPV commonly employed in the emergency department with the addition of a nasal cannula.    6.  RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a randomized cross over study. A convenience sample of staff and resident physicians and physician assistants from the San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC) Department of Emergency Medicine will be used to assess end-tidal oxygen saturations following a period of NIPPV using CPAP with and without nasal cannula. Volunteers will be solicited via weekly Emergency Medicine Grand Rounds and staff meetings at SAMMC. Subjects will undergo permuted randomization by random number generator in blocks of 4 to randomize the order of intervention: NIPPV mask alone or NIPPV mask with nasal cannula at 15L/min of oxygen. An emergency medicine trained physician will place equipment and operate the ventilator. After placement of the NIPPV mask and prior to each study intervention period, appropriate adjustments to enhance mask seal will be made as would happen in a therapeutic setting and subsequently the volunteer will undergo three minutes of continuous NIPPV. End-tidal oxygen concentrations will be measured at the end of the three minute ventilation period using an oxygen sensor.   7.  RESEARCH PLAN  7.1 Selection of Subjects  7.1.1. Subject Population.

Study Procedures/Research Interventions.  After obtaining consent, subjects will undergo randomization to order of intervention: NIPPV with (intervention) and without addition of nasal cannula at 15L/min of oxygen (control). Before the initial intervention, subjects will exhale through an oxygen sensor to determine baseline end-tidal oxygen concentration. For NIPPV without nasal cannula, subjects will have a CPAP mask placed and fitted appropriately. The NIV will be set to CPAP mode at 10cm H2O. During NIV with nasal cannula, subjects

Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 4 of 6 will first be fitted with a standard adult nasal cannula at 15L/min flow of oxygen and then fitted for a NIV mask in the same fashion as NIV without nasal cannula. For each trial, subjects will undergo three minutes of spontaneous restful tidal volume ventilation while on CPAP via NIV mask. At the end of three minutes, subjects will remove the NIV mask and immediately exhale through an oxygen sensor, avoiding inhaling room air. After completion of the first arm, subjects will be given at least five minutes of breathing room air before undergoing the second phase of testing. Before beginning the second phase, subjects will exhale through the oxygen sensor to ensure return to baseline end-tidal oxygen concentration. If baseline has not been met, subjects will be allowed to breathe room air until end-tidal oxygen concentrations return to baseline levels. Subjects will then repeat the procedure of three minutes of spontaneous restful tidal volume ventilation while on CPAP via NIV mask, followed by an immediate exhalation through the oxygen sensors for measurement of end-tidal oxygen concentration.   7.3.1 Collection of Human Biological Specimens.

Patients will be randomized to which intervention that is performed first to limit any bias by order of intervention. Each subject will serve as their own control.    7.7 Confidentiality.  Data collection forms will be kept in a locked drawer in the locked office of the PI. Study data will be double-entered into spread sheet format for data analysis. No personally identifying information will be obtained on the data collection forms or data analysis spread sheet. Data collection forms will be kept until the time of study publication. Data analysis spread sheets will be stored on a personal BAMC network drive.   7.7.1 Certificate of Confidentiality.  N/A   8.0 RISKS/BENEFITS ASSESSMENT  8.1 Risks.  Subjects will be exposed to no greater than minimal risk. Risks include temporary local skin irritation due to noninvasive mask contact. Proper mask fit will be assessed by an emergency medicine physician. Transient eye irritation or sinus congestion will be minimized by ensuring appropriate mask fit. Additionally, mask placement will not exceed three minutes per intervention. Gastric distention will be minimized by using low airway pressures of 10cm H2O, well below the 20cm H2O threshold of the lower esophageal sphincter.10 Claustrophobia or anxiety may occur with mask placement and increased airway pressure. Subjects will be allowed to remove the mask at any time during the study and withdrawal from the study. All subjects will be monitored by a trained respiratory therapist or emergency medicine physician.    8.1.2 Potential Benefits.  There are no anticipated benefits for the study subjects. However, this study holds a potential benefit to patients who present needing emergent airway management by investigating ways to best pre-oxygenate subjects. By doing so, the potential exists to help minimize the complications associated with crash airways, namely, hypoxia.  9.  ADVERSE EVENTS, UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS, AND DEVIATIONS  9.1 The study protocol involves no more than minimal risk to subjects.  The only adverse effects from the NIPPV that are expected are mild skin, mucosal, or nasal irritation from the CPAP or anxiety or claustrophobia from the NIPPV mask.  If study subjects experience any of these adverse effects they will be allowed to immediately terminate the study protocol themselves or with the assistance of a respiratory therapist or emergency physician who will be available at all times during the study protocol.  9.2 Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others, Serious Adverse Events and Deaths to the Office of the IRB, BAMC.    All unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious adverse events, and all subject deaths related to the study will be reported within 48 hours of the research team’s knowledge of the event by phone (210-916-0606), by e-mail (BAMC_IRB_AE@amedd.army.mil), by facsimile (210-916-1650) or via letter addressed to Human Protections Administrator, Office of the Institutional Review Board, Brooke Army Medical Center, Attn: MCHE-CI,3698 Chambers Pass, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234-6315.

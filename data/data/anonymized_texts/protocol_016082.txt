PROTOCOL BODY  
1. Study Objective  
The objective of this pilot study is to determine if an experimental mouth rinse and a marketed 
dry mouth rinse are more effective in relieving dry mouth (as determined by the response to 
“relieving the discomfort of dry mouth”  question from the modified Product Performance and 
Attributes Questionnaire I / Moisturization and Dryness  (PPAQ I / MD )) compared to water .  
2. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a controlled, randomized, 3-treatment , 3-period crossover study  in subjects with self -
reported dry mouth symptoms as determined by subject responses to the Dry Mouth Inventory 
(DMI). A sufficient number of volunteers  will be screened to ensure enrollment of up to 3 0 subjects 
at Acclimation.  Subjects who meet the eligi bility criteria will continue in to the treatment phase of 
the study.  Safety will be assessed by Oral examinations at Baseline/Day1  and Day 4.  Subjects 
will complete  questionnaires at Baseline (before product use Day 1 only ), after immediate use , 
30 minutes , 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours after supervised product use on Day 1 and Day 4 of 
each period. The PPAQ II  questionnaire will be completed in the morning of  Day 4 of each period. 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment sequences  at the Baseline visit of Period 1 . The 
treatment and washout periods will be repeated until all three treatment periods have been 
completed.

Screening/ Acclimation Visit  
At the site, up to forty s ubjects will be asked to read and sign an informed consent  form and will 
receive a signed copy for their records.  Personal medical history information will be reviewed 
and retained as site source documentation.  Demographic information will be recorded,  and 
subjects will answer the DMI questionnaire to ensure study eligibility.  Entrance criteria will be 
assessed . At total of thirty q ualifying s ubjects will receive acclimation products and usage 
instructions. Subjects  continuing will begin using these  products in place of their normal oral 
hygiene products for the duration of the study . They  will be instructed to brush their teeth in the 
morning of Day 1 visit.  Subjects not meeting study entrance criteria will be dismissed.  
Treatment Visits, Periods 1 -3 
 
Day 1 On-site Visit 
Continuance criteria will be assessed. Subjects will complete a Baseline MD Questionnaire, 
followed by an oral examination . Subjects will  then be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence 
(Period 1 only). Assigned t reatment  product kit boxes will be distributed, written instructions 
reviewed, and subjects will use the assigned products for the first time under supervision by site staff. A timer will be set for 4 hours  and s ubjects will be instructed to refrain from eating, drinking, 
smoking, using their test products, using tobacco, using a medicated lozenge, chewing gum, or 
breath mints during the 4- hour time period. Immediately f ollowing product use, subjects will 
complete an  Immediate MD Q uestionnaire and Product Usage Questionnaire (analyzed outside 
of this protocol) . Subjects will remain on- site for the first 30 minutes to complete the PPAQ I/ MD 
30-minute Questionnaire.  Subjects will be instructed to complete PPAQ I/ MD  at 1-hour, 2- hour 
and 4- hour and to fill out the 4- hour Rating Questionnaire at 4- hour. Subjects w ho received rinse 
products will be reminded to use them at least one more time ( up to 5 times  daily)  after the l ast 
4-hour questionnaire for Day 1 has been completed.  Subjects will be reminded to bring their 
treatment boxes  to their next study visit , and t o refrain from using any rinse product  the morning 
of their site visit.  
Day 1 Off -site  
Subjects will complete questionnaires, PPAQ I/ MD, at 1 -hour (Day 1 PPAQ I/ MD 1h), 2- hour 
(Day 1 PPAQ I/ MD 2h), 4- hours (Day 1 PPAQ I/ MD 4h) , and a 4-hour Day 1 Rating 
Questionnaire. Subjects will refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, using tobacco, using a 
medicated lozenge, chewing gum, or breath mints during the 4- hour time period until the last 
questionnaire for Day 1 has been completed.  
All subjects will fill out a product diary tracking their product usage.  
Days 2 and 3 At -home  
Subjects will use the to othpaste products at home twice a day . Subjects that were assigned to 
the rinse products should use the rinse at least twice a day (no more than 5 times  a day ). All 
subjects will fill out a produc t diary tracking their product usage. Subjects will be reminded to 
follow the restrictions listed on the usage instructions.  There is no eating or drinking restrictions 
for Day 2 and Day 3.  Subjects from all groups will be allowed to sip unlimited amount of water .

Page 6 of 16 Business Use  
Day 4 On-site Visit 
Before coming to  the site, subjects will complete a PPAQ II questionnaire (this questionnaire 
should be completed immediately after waking up) .  Subjects will also be sent a reminder to brush 
but not to use the assigned rinse product the morning, and to bring treatment products  and the 
completed PPAQ II to  their next site visit. Continuance criteria will be assessed, and t ake-home 
rinse  products , product diaries  and completed PPAQ II will be collected. An oral examination will 
be performed.  After the oral exam,  subjects will use the assigned products under supervision by 
site staff. A timer will be set for 4 hours. Subjects will remain on- site to complete the Immediate 
MD questionnaire and the 30-minute questionnaire (Day 4 PPAQ I / MD  30 min).  Subjects will be 
instructed to complete (Off-site) PPAQ I/ MD at 1 -hour, 2- hour and 4- hour and to fill out the 4-
hour Rating Questionnaire at 4- hour.  
At this visit site staff will remind the subjects to  refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, using any 
oral care products, using tobacco, using a medicated lozenge, chewing gum, or breath mints 
during the 4- hour time period. Subjects will be reminded to follow the restrictions listed on the 
usage instructions . 
At Period 3 Day 4 washout product  will be collected.  
Day 4 Off-site  
Subjects will complete a questionnaire, PPAQ I / MD , at 1 -hour (Day 4 PPAQ  I/ MD  1h), 2-hours 
(Day 4 PPAQ  I/ MD  2h), 4-hours  (Day 4 PPAQ  I/ MD  4h), and the  4-hour Day 4 Rating 
Questionnaire.  After the Day 4, 4- hour questionnaire s are completed, subjects will continue to 
use the study toothpaste for the wash- out period.  Subjects will refrain from eating, drinking, 
smoking, using any oral care products , using tobacco, using a medicated lozenge, chewing gum, 
or breath mints during the 4- hour time period until the last questionnaire for Day 4  has been 
completed.  
After the Period 3 Day 4  4-hour questionnaire s have been completed,  the subject will be 
dismisse d from the study , and a Subject Accountability form will be completed.  
 
Throughout the Study

8. Blinding, Labeling, and Shipping Plan 
Acclimation/Washout take- home kit boxes will be labeled with study number, emergency phone 
number, distributor name/address, appropriate caution statements, content statement and other 
information as required by internal regulations and clinical SOPs. Treatment take- home kit boxes 
will be identically sized and labeled with a unique kit box number or code, study number, emergency phone number, distributor name/address, appropriate caution statements, content 
statement and other information as required by  internal regulations and clinical SOPs.  The 
shipping containers will be labeled with the clinical site address and a content statement listing 
study number and kit box numbers contained within. The site will be provided with a 
randomization treatment sequence and supplemental product.  
The site will be provided with a code breaker report in a sealed envelope.  The sealed code breaker report contains documents that list the kit box number or treatment code while the identity 
of the treatment products is hi dden by an opaque scratch- off seal.  If the study blind needs to be 
broken, an individual subject’s investigational product may be ascertained by opening the sealed 
code breaker report, locating the subject’s kit box number or treatment code and scratching off 
the opaque seal to reveal the treatment identity .  The sealed code br eaker report will be opened 
if a clinically serious AE occurs or  management of the subject requires knowledge of the identity 
of the investigational product.  The Investigator should  immediately inform the Sponsor that the 
code will be broken and r ecord the date, time and reason for breaking the code in writing.  After 
the study is complete and the study database has been finalized and locked, the site will return 
the code breaker rep ort to the Sponsor using the self -addressed, stamped envelope provided by 
the Sponsor.

Treatment Sequence Schedule  
Each of the eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment sequences.   
Subjects will be assigned to a treatment sequence in the order they come to the site during their 
first Baseline visit using a Treatment Sequence Schedule. The site will keep the Treatment 
Sequence Schedule while the study is on- going.  Should a subject miss a treatment period, that 
treatment in the sequence will be skipped.  
10. Determination of Sample Size  
Sample size is based on logistical considerations.  
11. Safety Variables  
Oral Examination  
Assessment of the oral soft tissue is conducted via a visual examination of the oral cavity and 
perioral area utilizing a standard dental light, dental mirror, and gauze. The structures examined include the gingiva (free and attached), hard and soft palate, oropharynx/uvula, buccal mucosa, 
tongue, floor of the mouth, labial mucosa, mucobuccal/mucolabial folds, lips, and perioral area. 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2019138  Conf idential  
Page 10 of 16 Business Use  
Assessment of the oral hard tissues are conducted via a visual examination of the dentition and 
restorations utilizing a standard dental light, dental mirror, and air syringe. All abnormal findings 
are recorded and categorized by their location with hard tissue findings categorized as “other -
oral.”  An AE is recorded if a new abnormal finding is noted after treatment application or any 
abnormal finding noted prior to treatment application increases in severity after treatment is 
applied.  
12. Hypothes es 
The following hypothes es will be tested for each response to the PPAQ I / MD  questions , the 
PPAQ II questions , and the rating questions at each applicable time point:  
 Null:  The mean response is equal between the Experimental rinse and Water . 
Alternative:     The mean response is not equal between the Experimental rinse and Water . 
 
 Null:  The mean response is equal between the Marketed rinse and Water . 
Alternative:     The mean response is not equal between the Marketed rinse and Water . 
 
The primary endpoint will be the response to “ relieving the discomfort of dry mouth” from the 
modified PPAQ I / MD  two hour s after supervised product use on Day 4 of treatment.  Responses 
to all other questions and time points will be of secondary interest.  
13. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
Responses to the questions will be analyzed separately using a general linear mixed mode l for a 
crossover with period and treatment as fixed effects and subject as a random effect.  Carryover will be assessed and if reasonably appropriate, it may be included in the statistical model.   
Statistical comparisons will be two- sided with a significance level of 0. 10.  No adjustments will be 
made for multiple comparisons.  Additional analyses of the data may be performed.   This may 
include but is not limited to area under the curve (AUC).

Advertising  
If the Oral Health Science Center chooses to advertise for subjects, whether in professional or 
consumer publications, radio, television, or any other means, all advertising must be approved by 
the IRB prior to use, documented, and retained.  
Confidentiality  
Subject files will be mai ntained in a locked location for the duration of the study.  The recipients 
will treat this information confidentially.  In the event of any publication regarding this study, 
subject identity will not be disclosed.  
Direct access to study records and source data/documentation, including subject medical 
records, will be provided as needed to appropriate parties for the purpose of trial -related 
monitoring, auditing, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection.  Prior to participating in the study, subjects will consent, in writing, to the release of their medical records for said purposes.  
Data Collection  
The Data Manager will supply the paper and/or electronic CRFs to be used in this study.  It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to maintain and submit acc urate and timely CRFs to the Sponsor.  
All hard copy CRFs will be filled out legibly in ink.  
All questions should be answered.  For paper CRFs, if an entry requires correction, a single line will be placed through the entry so as not to obscure the origin al record, the corrected entry will 
be initialed and dated by the individual making the change, and a reason will be given for the change.  There will be no whiteouts or erasures.  For electronic CRFs, if an entry requires 
correction, the change is made di rectly to the CRF in the database, the user is prompted to 
provide a reason for the change, and the correction is logged in by an electronic audit trail.  
As necessary, the Data Manager may make specified allowable changes to the database without 
issuing a query to the site, as agreed upon by study site per this protocol. Examples of allowable 
changes include incorrect date formats, incorrect current year recorded (as in the start of a new 
year), and unambiguous spelling errors. Changes to common abbreviations and symbols to equivalent text to meet system or coding constraints (e.g., @ = at, ~ = approximately), may also 
be allowable. Values that are ambiguous or open to interpretation will be queried to the sites.  It 
is the responsibility of the Data Manager  to ensure all changes are supported by information 
contained elsewhere and/or are unambiguous.  
Source Documents  
The Investigator has the responsibility for ensuring that all source documents (i.e., study and/or medical records) and CRFs are completed and maintained according to the study protocol and 
are available at the site.  Any CRF used as a source document must be identified as such in the Investigator Notebook.  
Good Clinical Practices

[ICH-GCPs, as published by the FDA on 9 May 1997, Federal  Register, Volume 62, Number 90 
pages 25691- 25709]).  During the course of the trial, the clinical site is monitored by P&G staff 
(Clinical Trial Manager or designee) to ensure compliance with the Protocol, regulations and guidelines, adequacy  of the equipment and facilities, and satisfactory data collection.   
Informed Consent  
A subject consent form will comply with all applicable regulations governing the protection of human subjects.  The elements of informed consent and the documentation of  informed consent 
are specified in 21 CFR 50.25 and 50.27 and/or ICH GCPs chapter 4.  Each subject must sign 
and date an informed consent to serve as a participant in the study.  A signed copy of the consent form will be given to the subject and a signed c opy will be retained by the Oral Health Science 
Center.   Subjects may withdraw from participation in the study at any time.  Additionally, the 
Investigator may withdraw subjects from the study if it is in the best interest of the subjects.  The reason for all subject withdrawals from the study will be documented on the appropriate CRF.  
Institutional Review  
Prior to study initiation, the Investigator must obtain institutional review and approval of both the Protocol and the consent form, in compliance with t he US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, 
Part 56 or the ICH -GCPs Consolidated Guidelines, Chapter 3.  The Investigator maintains any 
original authorization letter(s) and forwards copies to P&G.  IRB approval letters should include 
the study title, P&G study number, the address of the IRB, date of request, and the signature of 
the IRB chairperson/designate.  Additionally, the letter must acknowledge that both the Protocol 
and consent form have been approved by the IRB, with notification of any changes required.  The 
study does not begin until P&G has received written confirmation of IRB approval.  This IRB shall 
also review the investigation at least once a year during study execution.  The Investigator notifies 
the IRB when the study is terminated.  
Monitoring  
Prior to commencement of the study, an initiation meeting will be held with the appropriate Oral 
Health Science Center personnel to review the objectives and procedures of the clinical trial.  To 
assure accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable data, the Oral Health Science Center and 
study procedures will be monitored by a Clinical Trial Manager  in accordance with 21 CFR 312 
and ICH GCPs Chapter 5.  
The Oral Health Science Center study coordinator is expected to contact the Clinical Trial Manager or designee as needed regarding study concerns and/or questions.  
Protocol Amendments/Changes  
Changes to the Protocol following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval affecting the safety of subjects, scope/objectives of the investigation, or the scientif ic quality of the study are 
documented as amendments.  Such changes require P&G, Investigator, and IRB approval prior 
to implementation, unless immediate action is required to safeguard subject safety.  
Administrative/minor changes (e.g., typos, changes in  P&G personnel [excluding medical 
monitor], etc.) are documented as revisions but do not have to be submitted as amendments 
unless required by the IRB.  Any change in P&G’s monitoring staff, Clinical Trial Manager or Medical Monitor during the conduct of t he study, must be reported to the Investigator.

Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
A serious adverse event  is defined as an event, which suggests a definite hazard or handicap to 
the subjects. Serious adverse events are any events resulting in death, life thr eatening situation, 
disability or permanent damage, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
congenital anomaly/birth defects; events requiring intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment/damage; or other serious (important) medical  events.  
When an Investigator is notified of a serious AE, the Investigator must promptly (within 24 hours) notify the Sponsor (Clinical Trial Manager or the Medical Monitor) of the serious or unexpected 
event, regardless of causality.   Within 5 working days, a written and/or electronic report describing 
the circumstances of the event must be submitted to the Sponsor. The Investigator will be 
responsible for SAE reporting to the IRB.   
Study Medication Dispensing, Storage and Accounting  
Study products are stored in a secure area, under environmental condition as required by label 
instructions or as described in the Protocol, and dispensed only under the authorization of the 
Investigator.  The storage condition shall be properly documented.  Bot h the receipt and 
dispensation of all test products (used and unused) are documented using forms provided by 
P&G or suitable forms provided by the site.  Study products are returned to P&G following the trial, or alternatively, they are destroyed at the cl inical site provided the site has an existing SOP 
for the destruction of clinical materials and prior written approval from P&G.  
Study Termination  
The study is terminated upon completion of all subject treatments and evaluation.  The study may be discontinued at any time.  
Subject Consent  
The Investigator obtains written informed consent for each subject prior to that subject’s participation in the study, per the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 50.25 and 50.27 
and ICH -GCPs, Chapter 4, subpart  4.8.  Subjects, or their legal guardian, are required to read, 
sign and date an IRB approved consent form with the Investigator also maintaining a signed and 
dated copy.  The subject or legal guardian will be given a copy of the consent form.  All study 
procedures must be explained in non- technical terms.

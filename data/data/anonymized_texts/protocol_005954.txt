Title:  A  Validation of the Acumen™ Assisted  Fluid Management (AFM)  
Short Title:  AFM Study 
Purpose:  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Acumen™ 
Assisted Fluid Management (AFM) Feature  in its ability to predict a subjec t’s fluid 
responsiveness. The validity of the fluid bolus recommendation will be analyzed by 
reporting the number of recommendations followed by delivered boluses that did and did 
not have a stroke volume response meeting the set fluid strategy.  
Subject s enrolled in the validation study will have their fluid management decisions guided 
by the AFM  Feature.  The decision to provide fluid as recommended  by the AFM Feature 
lies solely with the treating investigator.  When a fluid recommendation is made by th e 
AFM Feature, the investigator will assess the subjec t holistically prior to accepting or 
declining the system recommendation.

Endpoints:  Primary effectiveness endpoint:  
Evaluate the performance of the AFM feature in its ability to predict the fluid 
responsiveness of a subject . 
Primary safety endpoint: 
The primary safety endpoint is the assessment of serious adverse events which may be 
related to the Acumen™ Assisted Fluid Management Feature.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design  
 The objective of this non- randomized, open label study  is to evaluate the safety and  efficacy of an 
intraoperative imaging system, the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 in conjunction with imaging device LUM 2.6), in identifying residual cancer in the tumor bed of female breast cancer subject s.   
The study is composed of a Feasibility Trial  divided into Phase A  (up to 15 total subjects , 
completed as of December 4, 2015 ) and Phase B (up to 50 total subjects) . Phase A include d 5 
subjects not injected with LUM015 for autofluorescence tissue assessment and 10 subjects receiving LUM015 (as outlined below) to assess the ability to distinguish LUM015 from autofluorescence. Phase A conclude d with the analysis of the data to (1) assess patient safety, (2) 
determine the parameters of the detection algorithm, (3) select the dose for Phase B and (4) evaluate the device function. These results w ere reported to FDA prior to starting the Phase B part 
of this study . In Phase A, no adverse eve nts related to the investigational product were reported 
(n=15 patients). Lumicell also determined the tumor detection threshold parameters based on 
comparison of imaging data with pathology results. The dose selected for Phase B is 1.0 mg/kg based on Lumi cell’s dose -response model and Phase A data. During Phase B, we will preliminarily 
assess the performance of the detection algorithm  and adjust the threshold parameters if needed.  
Nomenclature:  
Throughout this protocol, reference is made to the orientation of the lumpectomy cavity (tumor 
bed) and the shaved margins specimens. When a lumpectomy is performed, there are typically 6 surfaces defined as if the cavity is a cube. To determine the margin status (either positive or negative), a cavity shaving is tak en from each surface of the tumor bed and analyzed by a 
pathologist. Note that there will be no intraoperative frozen section analysis of the gross resection or shavings during this study because frozen section analysis is not standard of care for breast 
cancer surgeries. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the nomenclature for the 
lumpectomy cavity margins, showing 5 locations. The sixth surface (not shown in the figure) is the “anterior” margin which is the margin nearest to the skin which could blend into one or more of the side surfaces depending on how the initial incision is done. Typically, a shaved margin specimen is not taken from the posterior surface if the lumpectomy cavity reaches the fascia over the pectoral muscle. Thus, in a given lumpectomy, there will be between 4 to 6 shaved margin specimens.  
Margins will be assessed per standard of care by a pathologist by measuring the distance to the inked s urface of each tissue shaving from invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In 
this study, a positive margin is defined as invasive cancer or DCIS present on the inked surface.

Figure 1:  Schematic representation of the surfaces of a lumpectomy cavity (white circle). The 
posterior margin is nearest the fascia. The anterior margin (not shown) is nearest the skin.  
 
For each of the lumpectomy surfaces, we use the naming convention shown in Figure 2 to compare 
imaging versus pathology. For example, consider the lateral location. The surface of the gross 
resection facing the lateral location is called margin 1 (M1). The exposed surface in the lateral 
location of the lumpectomy cavity is called tumor bed 1 (TB1). Once the standard of care cavity shaving specimen is taken, the opposite side of the shaving is called margin 2 (M2). The newly exposed surface in the  lumpectomy cavity is called tumor bed 2 (TB2). We use this naming 
convention throughout this protocol. 
 
 
Figure 2:  Schematic representation of the gross resection  and the cavity shavings. Standard of 
care lumpectomy is depicted in blue ( lumpectomy specimen  and first cavity shaving). The second 
(yellow) and third (red) cavity shavings are only removed when the LUM Imaging System 
indicates that residual cancer is present (Phase B of the Feasibility study).  
 
The following will be used as the definitions for determining the performance of the LUM imaging system  at the per -tissue level . 
• True positive = fluorescence above normal tissue threshold found in the sample + abnormal tissue found in the sample by histopathology  
• False positive  = fluorescence above normal tissue threshold found in the sample + no 
abnormal tissue found in the sample by histopathology  
• True negative = no fluorescence above normal tissue threshold found in the sample + no abnormal tissue found in the sample by histopathology  
• False negative = no fluorescence above normal tissue threshold found in the sample + abnormal tissue found in the sample by histopathology

 Phase A will consist of 15 evaluable subjects  
• Arm 1: 5 subjects not injected with LUM015  
• Arm 2: 5 subjects injected with 0.5 mg/kg of LUM015 
• Arm 3: 5 subjects injected with 1.0 mg/kg of LUM015 
 
The first group of 5 subjects w as not injected with LUM015 to measure the normal tissue 
autofluorescence baseline. The second group of 5 subject s was injected with LUM015 at a dose of 
0.5 mg/kg. T he third group of 5 subjects w as injected with LUM015 at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg  to 
assess the ability to distinguish LUM015 fluorescence signal from autofluorescence baseline . The 
objective was to determine the average tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio (T:N) at both the 0.5 
mg/kg  and 1.0 mg/kg doses. In previous versions of the Investigational Protocol, t he dose that 
generated the highest tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio w as going to be selected for Phase B. If 
both doses generate d the same T:N, then the lowest dose, namely 0.5 mg/kg, w as going to be 
selected for Phase B . 
 Based on Phase A data, Lumicell developed a dose -response model (see Appendix C)  to predict 
the effects of dose on T:N and signal variations. Based on these results, the dose of 1.0 mg/kg was 
selected for Phase B.  
 
Subjects in Phase B will be injected with a dose of 1.0 mg/kg . Phase B will enroll 10 evaluable 
subjects  with positive margins based on histological margin assessment from  the initial shaved 
margin  (with a maximum enrollment of up to 50 subjects  to achieve 10 subjects with positive 
margins ). 
 The total enrollment of th e Feasibility study  is 25 to 65 subjects  (15 subjects in Phase A and up to 
50 subjects in Phase B) . The endpoints for the Phase A and Phase B of the Feasibility study are 
outlined below.  
Endpoints:   
 Phase A:  
• Select the dose (either 0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg)  for Phase B and pivotal studies  that 
generates the largest average tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio. 
• Define the parameters for the detection algorithm to be used in the Phase B portion of the 
study . 
• Collect safety data  
Phase B:  
• Evaluate and, if necessary, adjust the detection algorithm parameters  
• Adjust, if necessary, the protocol for the pivotal t rial. 
• Collect safety data

 General Procedure:  (Same for both Phase A and B)  
The first group of 5 subjects  in Phase A will not be injected with LUM015 but will undergo the 
procedure outlined below as if they were injected with LUM015. Because of their exposure to the 
LUM 2.6 Imaging Device, t hese initial 5 subjects will be followed and monitored for safety in the 
same manner as all the patients injected with LUM015 . The second group of 5 subjects (and the 
third group of 5 subjects, if necessary) in Phas e A and all subjects  in Phase B  will be injected with 
LUM015 between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg , or 1.0 mg/kg. The selection 
of these doses and the timing of injection prior to surgery are based on the results of a n IND  phase 
I study in sarcoma and breast cancer subjects undergoing tumor removal surgery.  A summary of 
the IND phase 1 study can be found in Section 10 below . Subjects will be observed to collect safety 
data of the LUM Imaging System  from the time of injection  of LUM01 5 to the time they are 
discharged from the hospital.  The subjects will have a final safety assessment at the first post -
operative visit.  
 
Patients will be injected with LUM015 2 -6 hours prior to surgery. For patients with non- palpable 
tumors, an ultrasound or mammogram guided needle localization procedure  will be performed 
after LUM015 injection. Patients having sentinel node biopsies will be injected with Technetium -
99 per standard of care. The injection of Technetium -99 may occur before or after injectio n of 
LUM015. Note that methylene blue or any other blue dye used for sentinel node mapping will not 
be used in this study.  
 
Prior to the surgery, the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device will be located in the surgery room and an 
initialization procedure will be conduct ed to ensure that the performance parameters of the device 
are within defined specifications. If during the initialization procedures, the performance 
parameters are outside the defined specification, the user is prompted to discontinue use of the 
device. These patients will receive standard of care treatment and will not be imaged with the LUM 
2.6 Imaging Device. These patients will be followed and monitored for safety the same way as 
those patients that undergo imaging with the LUM 2.6 Device. These patie nts will be included in 
the safety cohort  but will not be part of the imaging analysis (efficacy) cohorts. 
 
During histology analysis by the pathologist, images from the histology slides will be recorded for 
concordance with the fluorescence imaging result s from the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device.  
 
Phase A  Procedures : 
  
1. LUM 2.6 Imaging Device is initialized.  
2. For surgeries with sentinel lymph node resection:  
a. surgeon performs axillary incision  
b. surgeon records 3- 4 images of normal appearing tissue within the axillary 
incision using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device  
c. surgeon performs sentinel node resection procedures and sends node speci men 
for intraoperative analysis

 d.  surgeon records whether any interference or adverse impact of LUM015 on the 
sentinel lymph node procedures.  
3. Surgeon performs surgical incision in the breast.  
4. Surgeon removes lumpectomy specimen  (gross resection).  
5. For non- palpable tumors, the lumpectomy specimen is imaged by x -ray at the OR 
suite . The surgeon will remove additional tissue  (which is part considered part of the 
gross resection)  if indicated by the x -ray imaging results.  
6. Surgeon records  3-4 images  of normal appearing tissue on the underside of the skin 
flaps  using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . These images will be used for evaluation of 
baseline fluores cence of normal tissue.  
7. Surgeon scans the tumor bed cavity (TB1, Figure 2) with the LUM 2.6 Imaging 
Device and research assistant records images from every surface. Th e surgeon is 
blinded to the images.  
8. Surgeon removes one shaved margin specimen from each tumor bed cavity surface per standard of care at MGH. Final margin assessment is based on pathology analysis 
of this shaved margin specimen. 
9. Surgeon scans the tumor be d cavity (TB2) with the LUM 2.6 Imaging D evice and 
research assistant records images of every surface. The surgeon is blinded to the 
images.  
10. Standard of care surgery continues. 
11. Surgeon or research assistant records images from the 6 faces of the lumpectomy  
specimen ex vivo  using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . 
12. Surgeon or research assistant records images of both sides of the shaved margin specimens  (TB and M surfaces)  ex vivo using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device and 
marks with purple ink areas highlighted as suspic ious by the LUM Device . 
13. Surgeon or pathologist inks and then transects  the lumpectomy specimen and records 
an image from the cross section of the specimen.  
The table below shows the data to be collected. Note that TB1 will be imaged twice: once in vivo 
in the lumpectomy cavity and once ex vivo in the shaved margin to account for potential spatial 
differences between the in vivo and ex vivo tissue images.

Final margin assessment will be done by radial sectioning of the cavity shavings to examine the 
M2 surface  per standard pathology protocols . 
 
Imaging data with their respective histologic assessment for the presence of abnormal tissue were 
used to generate receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves based on Lumicell ’s abnormal 
tissue detection thresholds  described below .  
 From the Phase A imaging data, Lumicell used the metric  of TB1000, which is defined as the 
minimum signal from the brightest contiguous cluster of 1000 µm diameter in  the field of view. 
We selected the TB1000 metric as it represents true spatial characteristics of foci of cancer and is likely to give the best results going forward. The data from Phase A showed relatively small patient -to-patient variations in signal, t hus a fixed, absolute threshold can be used to discriminate 
between tumor and normal tissue images. The fixed threshold is represented as:  
 
Tumor present if TB1000 signal in a given tissue image >  Y 
 
Although our Phase A data shows that a fixed threshold w orks well with the small population 
tested, it is possible that with a larger population we may encounter larger patient- to-patient 
variations. Thus, Lumicell decided to plan for the possibility of needing a threshold that varies proportional to normal tis sue signal. This patient -specific variable threshold is represented as:  
 
Tumor present if TB1000 signal in a given tissue image >  a*subject’s normal tissue signal 
baseline  
 
The normal tissue signal baseline is determined by calculating the 25
th percentile for each of the 
in vivo images recorded before the surgeon removed the standard of care cavity shave and selecting 
the lowest value among them.  
 
Lumicell’s software compares the fixed threshold with the patient- specific variable threshold for 
each patient and will select the lower of the two to determine whether tumor is present in the tissue 
until one threshold approach proves to be superior.

 Phase B  Procedures : 
1. LUM 2.6 Imaging Device is initialized.  
2. For surgeries with sentinel lymph node resection:  
a. surgeon performs axillary incision  
b. surgeon records 3- 4 images of normal appearing tissue within the axillary 
incision using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device  
c. surgeon performs sentinel node resection procedures and sends node speci men 
for intraoperative analysis   
d. surgeon records whether any interference or adverse impact of LUM015 on the 
sentinel lymph node procedures.  
3. Surgeon performs surgical incision in the breast.  
4. Surgeon removes lumpectomy specimen  (gross resection).  
5. For non- palpable tumors, the lumpectomy spe cimen is imaged by x -ray at the OR 
suite. The surgeon will remove additional tissue  (which is part considered part of the 
gross resection)  if indicated by the x -ray imaging results.  
6. Surgeon records  3-4 images  of normal appearing tissue on the underside of the skin 
flaps  using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . The software will use these images to set 
the abnormal tissue detection threshold using the algorithm confirmed during Phase 
A. 
7. Surgeon scans the tumor bed cavity (TB1) with the LUM 2.6 Imaging D evice and 
research assistant records images from every surface and takes note of the quadrants 
identified as containing fluorescence above the abnormal tissue threshold (these regions will be displayed in red in the screen). The surgeon is blinded to the images.  
8. Surge on removes one shaved margin specimen from each tumor bed cavity surface 
per standard of care at MGH. This shaved margin specimen will be analyzed by the 
pathologist to evaluate whether the subject had a positive margin after standard of 
care treatment.  
9. Research assistant informs the surgeon of the imaging results from step 4.  
10. Surgeon scans the tumor bed cavity (TB2) with the LUM 2.6 Imaging D evice while 
surgeon and research assistant observe the real -time imaging results. Research 
assistant will record an image from each surface.  
11. Surgeon removes an additional shaved margin specimen from any surface showing residual fluorescence (highlighted in red in the screen). Surgeon will repeat the 
imaging procedure until no residual fluorescence is observed but will not remove 
more than a total of 2 cm of additional margin tissue  in depth. Final margin 
assessment for each lumpectomy surface is based on pathology analysis of the final shaved margin specimen.  
12. Surgeon or research assistant records images from the 6 faces of the lumpectomy specimen ex vivo using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device  and applies purple ink to areas 
showing fluorescence .

 13. Surgeon or research assistant records images of both sides of the shaved margin 
specimens  (TB and M surfaces)  ex vivo using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device and 
applies purple ink to areas of shaved margin specimens showing fluorescence . 
14. Surgeon or pathologist inks and then transects lumpectomy specimen and records an image from the cross section of the specimen.  
15. Standard pathology inks will be applied by the pathologists per standard of care to gross specimen and shave margin specimen surfaces over the ink marking 
fluorescence, allowing complete pathological correlation of fluorescence and standard 
pathology findings.  
 Imaging data from gross resection dissection, M1, TB1 and M2 with their respective histologic 
assessment  (when available)  for the presence of abnormal tissue will be used to preliminarily 
evaluate the feasibility of the detection algorithm in identifying residual cancer . In addition, data 
analysis will compare positive margin rates based on the first standard of care shaved cavity margin (M1) and the positive margin rate based on the final, image guided shaved margin. This data will support the endpoints for the subsequent pivotal study.  
 During Phase B, after every 10 subjects complete the study, the safety data  will be reviewed before 
recruiting the next 10 subjects. After every 10 subjects, w e will also evaluate t he device 
functionality based on the initialization procedur e results and any changes to correct the device 
settings/components will be made.  
 
In some surgeries when the tumor is near the skin, a thin layer of tissue may be left just under the 
skin. Preliminary data shows that high fluorescence from the skin may create artifacts when 
imaging the thin layer of tissue in the lumpectomy cavity. In order to analyze possible  artifacts 
caused by skin’s fluorescence, we will perform imaging of the external breast tissue (skin) with 
the LUM Imaging Device  pre and post injection of the LUM015 dye . Our intent is for a physician 
or research assistant to obta in a baseline signal background measurement by placing the LUM  
Imaging Device on ipsilateral and contralateral breast skin. Images will be taken prior to injection to within 30 minutes post injection. This data may provide information for developing the pa tient-
specific tumor detection algorithm. If the physician or research assistan t deems that this procedure 
will add additional stress, the external breast imaging will not occur.   
 
Pathology analysis : 
 The purple ink applied during the ex vivo imaging proc edures with the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device 
will not interfere with standard pathology procedures  (see Appendix B for a detailed pathology 
protocol) . The purple ink will be applied to both surfaces of the shaved margin, except on the final 
shaved margin in whic h the purple ink will be applied only to the TB surface . All the resected 
specimens will be inked and processed per standard of care pathology procedures. After all the 
standard of care pathology procedures are completed, the study pathologist will review histopathology of areas marked with purple ink that designate areas of fluorescence identified by the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device and correlate fluorescence with histopatholog y findings. See 
Appendix B for details of the pathology procedures.

1.3 Objectives  
 
Primary objective s of the Feasibility Study:  
(1) To determine the dose to be used in the pivotal trial; (2) to evaluate the detection algorithm for identifying r esidual cancer in the tumor bed; and (3) to gather additional  
safety data of the LUM Imaging System in breast cancer subjects.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 2.1 LUM Imaging System  
The Lumicell imaging system is a combination product consisting of an imaging device 
and an imaging agent (LUM015). 
2.1.1 LUM Imaging Device  
The LUM Imaging Device consists of a computer control unit, monitor and light source mounted in a cart, and a hand- held imaging head (LUM 2.6 imaging head). 
The computer control unit collects, analyzes (based upon Lumicell’s detection 
algorithm) and displays the resulting images gathered by the imaging head in real -
time. The light source provides the illumination to excite the fluorescent dye present in LUM015. Light is transferred from the light source to the imag ing head using an 
optical fiber bundle. The imaging head ( Figure 3) was designed as a lightweight 
hand- held tool with a small profile to allow easy  maneuverability and limited 
intrusiveness into the operating room. The imaging head has a 45° bend at the dist al 
end for examination of the walls of the lumpectomy cavity.  
 The hand- held optical head will be used within the sterile surgical field.  
Consequently, a sterile barrier assembly will be used to cover the optical head, which comes into contact with both the surgeon and the patient’s exposed tumor bed. The sterile barrier assembly consists of a pre -assembled 1) sterile, disposable optical 
window made of plastic with a glass insert, which maintains the imaged tissue at the focal plane of the imaging system and 2) sterile, disposable plastic drape (510(k) 
clearance number K964142) . The disposable optical window and drape are installed 
on the LUM Optical Head in the OR following aseptic procedures just prior to the 
imaging procedures.  
  Lumicell’s intraoperative imaging approach consists of several steps: (1) acquire wide field of view image with microscopic resolution; (2) identify abnormal tissue  
using a computational algorithm; and (3) provide feedback to the surgeon by 
displaying the location of the abnorma l tissue  in an image (monitor) or indicating 
that the image of the zone does not have a positive indication of cancer tissue . Most 
importantly, all these steps are accomplished in real- time.

imaging head scanning a lumpectomy cavity. The sterile transducer cover over the device is not 
shown. 
 
The LUM 2.6 imaging head is powered by Lumicell’s proprietary detection software which processes  the fluorescence images, determines whether any tumor margin cells 
are in the field of view and highlights them.  The software performs corrections for 
camera dark counts and uneven illumination to improve performance across the entire field of view. The software uses images of normal tissue to set the threshold to 
identify normal from abnormal tissue. When the surgeon scans the tumor bed, the detection software compares the intensity of an image against the threshold and 
identifies  whether  a region of the image contains abnormal tissue . Regions with 
signal above the threshold are displayed as highlighted regions on the monitor . Figure 
3 shows an image of actual residual cancer ( Figure 4a and b) along with what the 
surgeon sees ( Figure 4c) in real -time with Lumicell’s algorithm indicating the 
regions with residual cancer to be remove d. The algorithm was developed based upon 
hundreds of tissue images from mice, dogs and humans compared against pathology of the imaged tissue . Based on a typical image size of ~6 Mbytes and a transfer rate 
of 10 Hz, the nominal requirements for the computer are: 2.0 GHz processor, 512 Mbytes of RAM, and operates in a Windows environment. The image acquisition and analysis software is written in C++.

after surgery in a mouse following IV injection of LUM015. (b) The same image was analyzed by Lumicell’s detection system and regions containing residual cancer are highlighted in red. (c) This panel shows the user interface that the surgeon will see.

 Lumicell engineered LUM015, a fluorescence -based imaging agent that accumulates 
within the tumor and the tumor invasive front and is activated by cathepsin enzymes 
at these locations to label regions that should be removed during surgery. In its native state, the fluorescence of LUM015 is suppressed by an internal quencher molecule  
(QSY21) ; however, once cathepsin proteases cleave LUM015 at its amino acid 
backbone, the quencher is released and the fluorescent dye Cy5 in LUM015 emit s 
detectable fluorescence  (Figure 5). The absorption and emission wavelength maxima 
for the fluorescent molecule used, Cy5, are 649 nm and 670 nm respectively. LUM015 employs a fluorescent molecule with excitation and emission in the far 
red spectrum (< 700 nm wavelength) because in that range light can travel effectively through 1mm of tissue and tissue autofluorescence is minimal, allowing higher sensitivity due to lower background [ 2]. 
 
Figure 5 : Schematic representation of LUM015.  
 Cathepsins are a family of enzymes that are involved with the degradation of the extracellular matrix to allow tumor growth and progression. These enzymes are 
upregulated in most human cancers and are also present in tumor associated macrophages at the inv asive front  [3-7]. Platt et. al.  show s 60-fold higher cathepsin 
activity in breast cancer tissue than in healthy breast tissue  [8]. Others report o ver-
expression of cathepsin enzymes (B, K, L and D) in ductal carcinoma in situ as well as in invasive carcinomas (lobular and ductal) [4, 8-11]. Also, cathepsin B is 
typically over -expressed in inflammatory breast cancer, the most lethal form of 
primary breast cancer with a 3 -year survival rate of 40% [ 12, 13]. The peptide 
sequence used in LUM015 is a pan- cathepsin substrate meaning that it will be 
cleaved by m ultiple enzymes of the cathepsin family. Because high activity of 
cathepsin enzymes is f ound in tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages 
surrounding the tumor at the invasive front, these enzymes provide an excellent marker for activating LUM015 at the tumor margin. The fluorescence of LUM015 is then detected with t he LUM Imaging System t o identify cancer and cancer -related 
cells from adjacent normal tissue.  
 Lumicell’s imaging agent application is unique as its properties allow the  detect ion 
of cancer cells at or just below the surface of the exposed tumor bed to be consistent 
with the margin assessment performed by pathology . For this protocol, positive 
margins are declared when cancer cells are present at  the inked surface . 
The safety of LUM01 5 has been  investigated under IND 111,670, in a  study titled:

 Cancer Specific Probe LUM015.”  The IND Sponsor is David G. Kirsch, MD, PhD, 
Associate Professor of Radiation  Oncology at Duke University School of Medicine 
where the study was being conducted.  The device component of the system was not 
used on subjects in the Phase I study, but was  used to image excised tissue in the 
pathology suite. No clinical  treatment decis ions were made on the basis of this 
imaging  during the Phase 1 study . 
The Phase I study has been completed with fifteen subjects participating in the trial (see Table 2 below for a summary of the study cohorts)  under the IND 111670. No 
adverse pharmacological activity (APA)  or adverse events were observed  in any of 
the subjects . Tissues from these subjects were imaged ex vivo using Lumicell’s 
current device and we determined an average tumor signal to background (normal tissue) signal ratio (TBR) of 5:1  (Table 3 ).

2.1.3 Use of the LUM Imaging System  
 
LUM015 is reconstituted in 0.45% saline at the institution’s pharmacy  prior to the 
injection  and is stable for 4 hours when stored at room temperature or 24 hours 
when stored refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C . Following the instructions for use, 
a calculated amount o f solution volume of LUM015 is obtained based on the dose 
and the patient’s  most recently obtained body weight  and placed in a sterile 
syringe. LUM015 is administered into the patient via slow intra -venous push 2 to 
6 hours prior to the surgery.  
 Prior to starting the surgery, the LUM Imaging Device will be located at the operating room and powering up routines and calibrations will be performed by OR personnel according to the instructions for use (IFU). A sterile imaging tip and drape will be installed ov er the device to provide a barrier between the imaging head and the sterile 
field. During surgery, once the surgeon removes the bulk tumor mass, the surgeon will place the LUM Imaging Head in contact with normal appearing tissue within the surgical incisio n to obtain a fluorescence baseline. Then, the surgeon will scan the 
tumor bed cavity. Real -time images are displayed in gray -scale and regions with 
residual fluorescence identified as abnormal tissue by Lumicell’s detection algorithm will be highlighted i n red in the screen ( Figure 4). The surgeon will then take 
shavings from the tumor bed cavity regions indicated to contain abnormal tissue.

 Final margin assessment by a pathologist is conducted based on the last shavings 
removed.  
 
To date, the intraoperative imaging system has been tested in mice and dogs and post -
surgery in humans and achieved superb sensitivity and specificity across these 
species and several cancer types as shown in Table 3. We define sensitivity and 
specificity when imaging is compared against pathology of the imaged tissue.

2.2 Study Disease  
 
We propose to conduct a clinical trial to test the performance of the LUM Imaging 
System  during  breast  tumor resection to ensure that negative margins are obtained during 
the initial surgery thus eliminating the need for a second resection. For br east cancer 
lumpectomies, the presence of residual cancer cells left in the tumor bed after initial 
resection is inferred by post -operative margin assessment of the resected tissue by a 
pathologist. If tumor cells are found near or at the edge of the resec ted tissue, the patient 
is considered to have close or positive margins. Positive lumpectomy margins are  the 
most important risk factor for local recurrence [ 14-16] and dictate that a second surgical 
procedure is required. Rates of close or positive margins have been reported in the range 
between 17 to 59% [ 17-21]. In two separate retrospective reviews of lumpectomies 
performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1997 and 2007, we found rates for close or positive margins of 23% [ 22] and 36% [23]. Our review also found that 91% 
of patients with positive margins had re -excision surgeries followed by adjuvant radiation 
therapy. Furthermore, approximately 32% of pat ients having either one or two re -
excisions still had close or positive margins. We estimate that i n the US more than 
150,000 women undergo lumpectomy for breast cancer each year and approximately a third of them require additional surgery for positive mar gins. Thus, a diagnosis of

18 
 positive margins indicates that additional treatments are needed which places  a heavy 
burden on patients and may be  a large added cost to the healthcare system.  
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
Detection of negative margins  during tumor excision is critical to assure all the cancer 
has been removed from the tumor bed. Current standard of care dictates that tissue 
removed during surgery is analyzed post -operative by a pathologist as described above. 
This procedure is time consuming, often requiring 7- 10 days of pathological testing after 
the operation before margin status i s known. In addition, this process is prone to sampling 
errors as only a finite number of tissue slices can be examined. Thus, a safe method to directly ass ess the entire tumor bed and identify residual microscopic disease for 
resection intraoperatively would be highly beneficial for patients.  
 Lumicell has developed the LUM Imaging System, a fluorescence- based imaging agent 
and a hand- held, wide -field detect or that can image the lumpectomy cavity in seconds to 
identify microscopic residual disease. The technology has demonstrated single cell detection  and is insensitive to the natural motions of the surgeon or the patient. Therefore, 
this technology may  enabl e surgeons to achieve negative  margins during the initial 
surgery and eliminate the need for re- excision surgeries. The detection system images 
the tumor bed, overcoming tissue handling and sampling limitations of standard pathology analysis of resected ti ssue. The LUM imaging head is compact, provides real -
time feedback to the surgeon about the status of the tumor bed, and does not require patient immobilization; hence, the technology does not have a significant  impact on the 
surgical workflow. With this technology, breast cancer surgeons  can make decisions that 
have the potential to prevent repeat surgeries, minimize patient discomfort, and reduce surgical risks.  
 
Lumicell has demonstrated safety and efficacy in  over 100 mice and 21 dogs (currently 
running a clinical trial in canine subjects  at Tufts University Cummings School of 
Veterinary Medicine with Dr. John Berg  and the Veterinary Specialty Hospital of the 
Carolinas with Dr. William Eward ).  
 The current pr otocol describes a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LUM I maging 
System in achieving negative margins in breast cancer subject s. In the initial feasibility 
study,  we will finalize the algorithm used in  the LUM Imaging System to detect residual  
cancer when compared against histology. In subjects from the Pivotal Study , we will 
prospectively evaluate the efficacy of the technology to detect residual cancer and reduce 
the rates of post -operative positive margins.

 3. SUBJECT  SELECTION  
 
3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
 
Subjects  must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to 
participate in the study:  
3.1.1 Subject s must have histologically or cytologically confirmed primary 
breast cancer . The methods for obtaining the histological samples can 
include diagnostic biopsies, core needle biopsies or fine needle biopsies.   
3.1.2 Female, a ge of 18 years or older. Because no dosing or adverse event data 
are currently available on the use of LUM015  in su bject s <18 years of age, 
children are excluded from this study.  
3.1.3 Subject s must be scheduled for a lumpectomy of a breast malignancy . 
3.1.4 Subject s must be able and willing to follow study procedures and 
instructions. 
3.1.5 Subject s must have received  and signed an inf ormed consent form.  
3.1.6 Subject s must be otherwise healthy except for the diagnosis of cancer, as 
per the exclusion criteria listed below.  
  
3.1.7 Subject s must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:  
• Leukocytes >  3,000/mcL  
• Platelets >  100,000/mcL  
• total bilirubin within normal institutional limits  
• AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) <  2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal  
• Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL  or creatinine clearance >  60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 
subjects with creatinine levels abo ve institutional normal.  
               
3.1.8 The effects of LUM015 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child- bearing potential must agree to use adequate 
contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control , abstinence) 
starting the day entering the study, and for 60 days after injection  of the 
imaging  agent. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is 
pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.  Breast cancer patients are routinely advised 
against pregnancy during treatment, so this requirement does not differ from standard of care.  
3.1.9 Subjects with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

 Subject s who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible for  
admission into the study. 
 
3.2.1 Subject s with a known current condition of substance addiction. 
3.2.2 Subject s who have taken an investigational drug within 30 days of 
enrollment.  
3.2.3 Subject s with prolonged QT interval.  
3.2.4 Subjects who will have administ ration of m ethylen e blue or any blue dye 
used for sentinel node mapping procedures  prior to imaging the 
lumpectomy cavity with the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . 
3.2.5 Subject s who have not recovered from adverse events due to 
pharmaceutical or diagnostic agents.  
3.2.6 Subjects with uncontrol led hypertension defined as persistent systolic 
blood pressure > 150 mm Hg , or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mm Hg; 
those subjects with known HTN should be stable within these ranges 
while under pharmaceutical therapy . 
3.2.7 Subject s with insulin dependent diabe tes mellitus.  
3.2.8 History of anaphylactic reaction attributed to any  contrast agent  or drugs 
containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) . 
3.2.9 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,  COPD or asthma requiring hospitalization 
within the past 12 months, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
3.2.10 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the teratogenic 
properties of LUM015 are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants  secondary to treatment 
of the mother with LUM015, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with LUM015. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.  
3.2.11 Subject s who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically 
acceptable forms of contraception  upon entering the study ; this exclusion 
is necessary because the teratogenic properties of the study imaging agent are unknown.  
3.2.12 HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are 
ineligible be cause of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with 
LUM015.  
3.2.13 Any subject for whom the investigator feels participation is not in the best interest of the subject.  
3.2.14 Subjects undergoing a second surgery because they had positive margins in a previous surgery.  
3.2.15 Subjects with prior ipsilateral breast surgeries , mastectomies, breast 
reconstructions  or implants.  (Note: subjects who have had prior breast 
biopsies are not excluded ; see inclusion criterion 3.1.1.)  
3.2.16 Subjects  with prior ipsilateral reduction mammoplasties or breast 
reductions performed less than 2 years prior to enrollment to this study.

 3.2.17 Subjects previously  treated with systemic therapies  to treat the cancer  to 
be removed during this clinical investigation , such as neo -adjuvant 
chemotherapy or  hormonal therapy.  
3.3 Inclusion of Women, Minorities and Other Underrepresented Populations  
 
As this study is to test the efficacy of an intraoperative imaging technology in female breast cancer subject s, all of the subject s will be women. Males with breast c ancer ( <1% 
of breast cancer patients) usually undergo mastectomy procedures  and only rarely have 
lumpectomies , and  thus  are not likely to be eligible for this study.  
 
4. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT 
  4.1 General Guidelines  for Screening and Enrollment  
 
The Institution will register eligible participants with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance 
Office for Clinical Trials (QACT) central registration system. Registration must occur prior to the initiation of therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol before treatment  begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
 An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the QACT protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 Following registration, participants may begin protocol treatment. Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s 
protocol status must be changed. Notify the QACT Registrar of participant status changes as soon as possible. 
 
The study team will document subject eligibility on the Screening and Enrollment form and notify Lumicell of a potential candidate for the study after the subject has been consented.  
 The subject is not considered enrolled into the study until written Informed Consent is obtained and the investigational product has been administered (Study Day One).  
 Lumicell will perform an analysis of the data collected in Arms 1 and 2 to determine if  
the acceptance criterion is met  (normal tissue signal is separated by 4 standard deviations 
from the mean autofluorescence in normal tissue ) and an additional  5 subjects  (Feasibility 
Study Phase A, Arm 3) will be enrolled in the study  if the acceptance cr iterion is not met.  
Lumicell will notify the clinical site when enrollment can restart.  
 
4.2 Enrollment  Process

 1.0 mg/kg. LUM015 will be diluted in 0.45% saline without glucose . LUM015 will be 
administered between 2 to 6 hours prior to the scheduled surgery.  
 
5.1 Pre-treatment Criteria  
 
No pre -treatment is required.  
   5.2 Agent Administration  
 
5.2.1 LUM015  
 
• Administration – The intravenous (IV) line through which LUM015 will be injected 
must be flushed with 10- 20 mL of saline just prior to injection of LUM015. 
LUM015 is administered as a slow push rate over 3 minutes in a single dose of 0.5 
mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg via peripheral IV injection in 0.45% saline without glucose  
between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery. The injection is immediately followed by a 
saline flush of 10- 20 mL . 
• Dosing – LUM015 is provided in amber vials in lyophilized form. Nominally each 
vial contains 10 mg of LUM015, 10 mg of mannitol, 0.83 mg of sodium ph osphate 
monobasic and 0.43 mg of sodium phosphate dibasic. Preparation of t he injection 
dose is explained in detail in Appendix A .  Upon reconst itution with 1.0  mL of 
0.45% saline  without glucose , the pH of the solution is 6.5. 
• As per IV injection standard of care, all subject s will be observed for signs of 
extravasation , or allergic reaction  following administration of LUM015  to monitor 
for adver se pharmacological activity related to the investigational agent .  All study 
safety assessments will continue until the first post- operative visit (approximately 
2-3 weeks after surgery).   
 
5.2.2 Other Modality(ies) or Procedures  
5.2.2.1 Subjects in Feasibility Phase A : 
The first cohort of patients in Phase A w ere not injected with LUM015 and 
under went  the procedure outlined below as if they were injected with 
LUM015. The second and third cohort s in Phase A w ere injected with 
LUM015 between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery  at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (n = 
5 subjects) , or 1.0 mg/kg (n = 5 subjects). The selection of t hese doses wa s 
based on the results of a phase I study in sarcoma and breast cancer subjects undergoing tumor removal surgery.  Subjects w ere observed to collect 
safety data of the LUM Imaging System  from the time of injection  of 
LUM015 to the time they were discharged from the hospital.  The subject s 
had a final safety assessment at the first post -operative visit.  After standard 
of care gross tumor resection, the  surgeon recorded  3-4 images from 
visually normal appearing tissue with the LUM imaging head. The surgeon record ed these images with the LUM imaging head from the anterior, 
posterior, medial, lateral, inferior and superior quadrants of the lumpectomy

 cavit y. All images w ere labeled according to the location from where they 
were taken in the lumpectomy cavity. N o clinical decision s were made 
based on the imaging results and the surgeon was  blinded to the all the 
imaging results to avoid bias towards excision  of more than standard 
amounts of shaved cavity margin tissue. Following standard of care 
practices, the surgeon then remove d an additional 5- 10 mm thick strip of 
tissue  (shaved cavity margins)  from the walls of the lumpectomy cavity for 
histologic al margi n assessment.  After the standard of care strip of tissue wa s 
removed, the surgeon recorded  images with the LUM imaging head from 
the newly exposed anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, inferior and superior quadrants of the lumpectomy cavity . All images were labeled according to 
the location from where they were taken in the lumpectomy cavity. An image was recorded from the inked surface of the additional strip of tissue 
removed. Images were also  recorded from the gross resection. Then a  
pathologist assista nt dissect ed a portion of the gross resection and record ed 
an image from the inside of the resection. 
5.2.2.2 Subjects in Feasibility Phase B  
Subject s undergoing breast cancer surgery will be injected with LUM015 
between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery at a dose of  1.0 mg/kg as determined 
from the results of the feasibility study  Phase A . Subjects will be observed 
to assess the safety of LUM015 from the time of injection to the  time they 
are discharged from the hospital. After standard of care gross tumor 
resection, the surgeon will record images with the LUM imaging head from 
the anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, inferior and superior surfaces of the 
lumpectomy cavity . These images will be used to determine the threshold 
based on the normal  tissue multiplier. Then the LUM Imaging System 
software compares this threshold against the fixed threshold and selects the  
lowest value as the threshold for that patient . All images will be labeled 
according to the location from where they were taken in the lumpectomy cavity. The surgeon will be blinded to this imaging result to avoid bias towards excision of more than standard amounts of shaved cavity margin tissue, but a technician at the instrument console will record whether the imaged tissue was clas sified as normal or abnormal by the LUM Imaging 
System.  After the standard  of care removal of the 5 -10 mm thick strip of 
additional tissue , the technician will reveal the results from the first imaging 
to the surgeon. T he surgeon will then record images fr om the new 
lumpectomy cavity’s walls  and will resect another 5 -10 mm strip of tissue 
from any surface identified as having abnormal tissue. The surgeon will limit the extent of additional tissue resected to 20 mm in thickness or less to minimize the cosmetic impact of the additional resection.  
 
In some surgeries when the tumor is near the skin, a thin layer of tissue may 
be left just under the skin. Preliminary data shows that high fluorescence 
from the skin may create artifacts when imaging the thin layer of tissue in

 the lumpectomy cavity. In order to analyze possible  artifacts caused by 
skin’s fluorescence, we will perform imaging of the external breast tissue 
(skin) with the LUM Imaging Device  pre and post injection of the LUM015 
dye. Our intent is for a  physician or research assistant to obtain a baseline 
signal background measurement by placing the LUM  Imaging Device on 
ipsilateral and contralateral breast skin . Images will be taken prior to 
injection to within 30 minutes post injection. This data may p rovide 
information for developing the patient -specific tumor detection algorithm. 
If the physician or research assistan t deems that this procedure will add 
additional stress, the external breast imaging will not occur.   
 
 
5.3 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxici ty 
 
Not applicable.  
 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
A complete listing  of all medications (including non -prescription, vitamins , herbal 
products  and essential oils ) taken within 24 hours  of the first dose will be obtained at 
screening and updated as needed at enrollment. Concomitant medications will be 
recorded in the medical record and case report form.  
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
The imaging agent LUM015 will be injected as a single dose betw een 2 to 6 hours prior 
to surgery. There is no recurrent administration of the imaging agent. The treatment 
ends after the surgery is completed. Subjects may be discontinued by the principal investigator at any  time for any of the following reasons:  
• unacceptable adverse event  or adverse device effect  
• administrative reasons , such as imaging agent no longer available  
• subject  noncompliance,  
• safety concern,  
• subject  decides to withdraw from the study, or  
• general or specific changes in the subject 's condition render the subject  
unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating investigator . 
 
5.6 Duration of Follow Up  
 
All study intervention will be completed at the end of the surgical procedure. The initial five subjects who were not injected with LUM015 , as well as all the subjects injected 
with LUM015 will continue to be monitored until hospital discharge. All subjects will 
continue their enrollment and be followed in the study until the ir medical team 
determines that no further surgical intervention is required. When attend ing their first 
post-operative visit  a blood draw will be collected for a CBC (red blood cells, white blood

 cells and platelets) and serum chemistry ( alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, BUN, 
calcium chloride, glucose, potassi um, total protein, SGOT [AST], SGPT [ALT], sodium) 
tests to assess for possible adverse events. At the time of the visit, the patient will be 
interviewed to determine any potential adverse events.  Subject s with adverse events that 
are determined to be pos sibly related to the investigational product will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. 
  
5.7 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Subject s will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.5 applies. 
The reason for study removal and the date the subject  was removed must be documented 
in the study -specific case report form (CRF).  A subject removed from the study will be  
given standard of care treatment. Subjects removed from the study prior to dosing will be replaced.  
 Individual patients may be discontinued from the study by the Investigator or the Sponsor 
at any time if either determines that it is not in the best interest of the patient to continue 
(e.g., continuation in the study represents a serious medical risk to the patient). This may 
include, but is not limited to, the presence of serious, life -threatening adverse events , 
unanticipated adverse device effects,  adverse events , or adverse device effects  that are 
unacceptable in nature, severity, or frequency as assessed by the Investigator.  
 
Patients must be discontinued if they become pregnant or withdraw consent. Patients may 
be discontinued due to noncomplianc e with the protocol. While patients will be 
encouraged to complete the study, they may voluntarily withdraw at any time. 
 
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, participating investigators must 
immediately notify the Lumicell Medical Sa fety Monitor :

5.8 Criteria for Stopping the Study  
 
The events listed below are the stopping rules criteria for the study. In the case of any of 
these events, no additional patients will be recruited, dosed or imaged until an explanation can be found.   
• Clinically significant laboratory findings that are de emed serious or severe (this 
includes if a trend is noted in clinically significant laboratory findings, see s ection 
10.3)  
• Any unanticipated adverse device effect  (as defined in section 11.1.4)

27 
 • Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions of Grade 2 or greater  as defined in CTCEA 
4.03 
• Any serious  adverse event  (as defined in section 11.1.2)  that is considered either 
possibly, probably or definitely related to the treatment with LUM015 or the 
Imaging Device.  
• Any other  event that is deemed  unacceptable in nature, severity, or frequency as 
assessed by the Investigator.  
 In the case that a safety event requiring enrollment suspension occurs, a prompt cumulative review of safety data and the circumstances of the event in question will be conducted to determine whether recruitment can  be resumed, whether the protocol should 
be modified, or whether the study will be discontinued permanently. The FDA and 
reviewing IRB must be notified of any event that triggers suspension of enrollment in 
this stu dy. If enrollment  is suspended for safety reasons and it is deemed appropriate by 
the sponsor to resume the study, approval from the FDA and IRB must  be obtained prior 
to resuming the study.  
 Regardless of whether recruitment is continued or not, all subje cts injected with LUM015 
or who were imaged with the LUM device  at the time of study -stopping criteria were met 
will continue to be followe d for safety.  
 In addition to the safety stopping rules outlined above, Lumicell may suspend or terminate this study at any time. The reasons for temporarily suspending or terminating 
the study may include but are not limited to the following:  
 
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory.  
• Non-compliance that might significantly jeopardize the validity or integrity of the 
study.  
• Sponsor decision to terminate development.

9. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
Not applicable.  
 
10. SAFETY  
 
A Phase 1 IND study in sarcoma and breast cancer patients has been completed at Duke University 
Medical Center. The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the safety of the LUM015 drug component. As a secondary endpoint, the signals from normal and tumor ti ssue were 
measured ex vivo using the LUM Imaging Device component. Twelve (12) sarcoma patients and three (3) breast cancer patients (invasive ductal carcinoma) have been injected with LUM015 with no adverse pharmacological activity reported ( Table 2).  The only noticeable effect in the study 
subjects has been the green discoloration of urine, which resolve d within 12 -24 hours post injection  
for most patients . 
  The first 3 eligible subjects were dosed at 0.5mg/kg LUM015 and t he second 3 subjects were dosed 
at 1.0mg/kg  LUM015, with both groups injected ~29 hours prior to surgery. Resected tissue was 
imaged with the LUM Imaging Device in the pathology suite . A comp arison of pharmacokinetic 
data from the initial 6 subjects to preclinical mouse studies suggested that a higher tumor:normal signal ratio would be achieved if tissue was imaged 4 -6 hours after injection. The next 3 subjects 
were injected with 1.0mg/kg of L UM015 and followed by 3 subjects injected with 1.5 mg/kg of 
LUM015 and the final cohort of 3 subjects was injected with 0.5mg/kg. These nine subjects were followed by surgical resection at approximately 6 hours after LUM015 injection (i.e. same day 
injection and surgery).  The Phase I study report will be available by the end of December 2014.  
 Initial pharmacokinetic data from the first 11 study subjects indicates that LUM015 is cleared with a half -life of 3.6 ± 0.6 hours (average ± standard deviation) ( Figure 6).

 10.1 Expected  Adverse Events  (associated with LUM015)  
  
No adverse events related to the administration of LUM015 were observed during the Phase 1 safety study. Prior to the Phase 1 study, LUM015 had not previously been used 
in humans. Our preclinical studies demonstrated that it was  reasonably safe to proceed 
with a P hase 1 study in humans. Preclinical studies in rats showed no LUM015 related 
effects on clinical observations, FOB evaluation, body weights, food consumption, ocular condition, clinical chemistry, hematology and coagulat ion parameters or organ 
weight at doses up to 53- fold higher than in humans. 
 The results from th e repeat dose toxicity study in dogs ( performed by NCI ) show that 
administration of 0.5 or 10.0 mg/kg of LUM015 intravenously once daily for seven consecutive days (8 total doses) did not cause any observable target organ toxicities. The 
only observable effect  was hypersensitivity in several dogs. Notably, no hypersensitivity 
has been observed in the human patients that participated in the Phase 1 safety study . 
 Clinicians should be prepared for a possible hypersensitivity  or allergic  reaction to occur 
during each administration of LUM015. Standing orders should be in place in the event 
of a hypersensitivity  or allergic  reaction for immediate intervention  including 
administration of diphenhydramine, prednisone or both. If a study subject develops a Grade 2 (or greater) hypersensitivity  or allergic  reaction  as defined in CTCEA 4.03, 
Lumicell should be contacted within 24 hours of the event:

  Jorge Ferrer   
  Phone: 617- 571-0592 
  Email: jmferrer@lumicell.com 
  fax: 781- 672-2501  
 If this occurs, enrollment in  the study should be held until a fter consul tation with the 
FDA regarding the event is  completed  and a determination is made  by the sp onsor, 
principal investigator and FDA  as to whether prophylactic treatment with 
diphenhydramine to subsequent subjects  is warranted .  
10.2 Monitoring of Laboratory Values  
 
A CBC (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) and serum chemistry ( alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, BUN, calcium chloride, glucose, LDH, phosphorous, 
potassium, total protein, SGOT [AST], SGPT [ALT], sodium) tests will be completed at the first post -operative visit during the routine follow up visit. We note that it is not 
standard of care to perform follow up blood tests unless abnormalities were identified 
prior to surgery. The investigator will review the laboratory reports for any abnormal post-operative laboratory valued and will determine if any results are clinically rel evant. 
Feasibility study of intraoperative imaging in breast cancer  
02AUG 2016    
LUMICELL COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
 
33 
 Any abnormal values that are determined to be clinically significant will constitute 
adverse reactions and will be capture d on the case report form. If a trend is noted of 
clinically significant laboratory findings (i.e. a specific event occurs in m ore than one 
patient), or if any serious adverse event that is possibly, probably or definitely related to LUM015 or the Imaging Device is reported, no additional patients will be recruited until an explanation can be found. The principal investigator will  assess the likelihood that the 
adverse reaction  or severe and/or serious adverse event  resulted from LUM015. The FDA 
will be notified of any trends observed in clinically significant laboratory findings.  
 
10.3 Expected  Adverse Device Effects (associated with the LUM Imaging System)  
 To date, the LUM Imaging System has not been studied clinically. Thus, there are no known anticipated adverse device effects.  
 
11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. The severity of any possible AE observed will 
be classified per the grading established by t he Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.03. 
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute advers e events only 
if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
11.1.2 Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life- threatening means that the person was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requ ires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the 
expected length of stay). Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before

34 
 the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed ear lier than 
planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical ev ent when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the subject  and require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive tre atment 
in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• respite care  
11.1.3 Adverse device effect  (ADE)  
 
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an adverse event which is at least possibly 
related to the device.  ADEs are not considered serious adverse events.  
11.1.4 Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs)  
 
Unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is  any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caus e by or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigation plan or application, or any 
other unan ticipated serious problem  associated with a de vice that relates to the 
rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
11.1.5 Expectedness  
 
Adverse events  (AEs) and adverse device effects (ADEs)  can be 'Expected' or 
'Unexpected' .  
11.1.5.1 Expected adverse event  or adverse device effect  
 
Expected AEs and ADEs  are those that have been previously identified 
as resulting from administration of the agent or use of the device . For the 
Feasibility study of intraoperative imaging in breast cancer

35 
 purposes of this study, an AE or ADE is considered expected  when it 
appears in the current AE/ADE  list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the 
Instructions for Use  or is included in the informed consent document as a 
potential risk.    
 
Refer to Section 10.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated 
with the study agent(s)  and Section 10.4 for a listing of expected adverse 
device effects associated with the imaging device.  
11.1.5.2 Unexpected adverse event  or adverse device effect  
 
For the purposes of this study, an AE or ADE  is considered unexpected  
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current AE/ADE  list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the Instructions 
for Use,  or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a 
potential risk.   
 
11.1.6 Attribution  
 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE  or ADE  is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE  or ADE  is likely rela ted to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE  or ADE  may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely -  The AE  or ADE  is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE  or ADE  is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
11.2 Procedures for Reco rding and Reporting  Safety  
 
The principal investigator  will assess the occurrence of AEs , SAEs , ADEs and UADEs  
at all subject  evaluation time points during the study.  
 All AEs, SAEs , ADEs and UADEs  whether reported by the subject , discovered during 
questioning, directly observed, or detected by physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and on the appropriate 
study -specific case report forms.  
 For events related to the i maging agent, t he descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE versi on 4.0.

 11.8 Monitoring of Adverse Events /Adverse Device Effects  and Period of Observation  
 
All adverse events  and adverse device effects , both serious and non- serious, and deaths 
that are encountered from initiation of study intervention, throughout the study, and 
within 30 days of the study intervention should be followed to their resolution, or until the principal  investigator assesses them as stable, or the principal  investigator determines 
the event to be irreversible, or the subject  is lost to follow -up. The presence and resolution 
of AEs , ADEs, SAE s and UADEs  (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate 
case report form and recorded in the subject ’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.  
 For some SAEs /UADEs , the investigator  or designee may follow -up by telephone, fax, 
and/or monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE /UADE  report (e.g., hospital discharge summary, 
consultant report, or autopsy report).  
 Subject s should be instructed to report any serious post -study event(s) that might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study. The principal investigator  should 
notify Lumicell and the  IRB of any unanticipated death or adverse event occurring after 
a subject  has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be 
related to the study.   
 Protocol Deviations:  
 
Protocol deviations to ongoing studies are any unapproved changes in the study design 
and/or procedures that are within the Investigator’s control and not in accordance with 
the IRB approved protocol.  The Principal Investigator  will complete the Protocol 
Deviation form provided in the Study Bi nder. Ad ditionally, the reviewing IRB has  to be 
contacted by t he Investigator if a Protocol Deviation mig ht either affect the participant’s 
right, safety or well-being, or might significantly affect the completeness, accuracy and 
reliability of the data. The Protocol Deviation form provided by Lumicell  will be used 
for this purpose. 
 
Note:  The Principal Invest igator will summarize any protocol deviations noted during 
the course of the study in a final statement. 
 In the case that the deviation was identified by the Investigator, the Investigator will 
use the Lumicell deviation f orm to summarize and assess the impact of the deviation.  
Similarly, the Lumicell protocol deviation form will be utilized  to communicate a 
deviation that is identified by Lumicell to the  investigator.   In both cases, the Investigator 
must provide Lumicell with a copy of the form submitted to their IRB or use the 
Lumicell form to document the deviation.  The deviation will be categorized in the 
description section of the form as a Protocol Waiver or Protocol Deviation. 
 
Examples of major Protocol Deviations include, but are not limited to the following:

12. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
12.1 Data Reporting  
12.1.1 Method  
Lumicell will collect, manage, and monitor data for this study.  
12.1.2 Data Submission  
It is the expectation that all CRFs will be completed in a contemporaneous manner 
to the time of study related procedures. Timely completion of the reports will allow Lumicell to monitor the study conduct and data in an effective manner.   
12.2 Safety Review  
 For this feasibility study, an independent safety reviewer will review and monitor adverse events data from this trial. The independent safety reviewer will be a clinical specialist with experience in oncology and who has no direct relationship with the study. Information that raises any questions about subject safety will be addressed with the 
Principal Investigator and study team.  
 After the completion of Phase A, the safety data from Phase A and from a repeat dose 
toxicity study in rabbits  will be evaluated prior to starting recruitment of subjects for the 
Phase B. Phase B must not commence without approval from FDA. During Phase B, after 
every 10 subjects complete the study, the safety data and device performance data wi ll 
be evaluated before recruiting the next 10 subjects.  
 
12.3 Monitoring  
 
Lumicell’s  monitoring process will be initiated with the initial visits to the site to assure 
that it meets the qualification requirements and has adequate experience to conduct the 
study protocol. When the site has met all qualification criteria, submitted all initial 
regulatory documentation, and received IRB approval for the study, Lumicell will 
conduct a study initiation visit (either face to face, or via web) in which the site team will receive protocol specific training in addition to a review of all investigator 
responsibilities, and expectations of Lumicell. Throughout the conduct of the study Lumicell will conduct intermittent site visits to assure compliance with the protocol and 
all applicable regulations. During these visits there will be a source data verification of

 critical data points transcribed to the CRF. At study completion, Lumicell will co nduct 
a study closure visit. This study visit will assure that all site regulatory documentation 
is present and updated; all data queries are resolved; verify the investigator has approved of all study data submitted to Lumicell; and all final disposition instructions from Lumicell have been delivered to the site investigator.  
 Involvement  in this study as a participating investigator implies acceptance of the 
approved protocol, the potential for audits or inspections, including source data 
verification, by  representatives of the FDA, Lumicell, the institutional review board, or 
their representatives . The purpose of these audits or inspections is to examine study -
related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted and data w ere recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported in accordance with the 
protocol, institutional policy, Good Clinical Practice s (GCP s), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
 
All data will be monitored for timeliness of submission, completeness, accuracy, and 
adherence to protocol requirements. Monitoring will begin at the time of subject  
registration and will continue during protocol performance and completion.

LUMICELL COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
 
43 
 The primary objective of this clinical trial is to study the  safety and  efficacy of an intraoperative 
imaging s ystem, the LUM Imaging System, to reduce the rate of breast cancer patients with 
post-operative positive margins. The safety of the imaging agent LUM015 was previously 
tested in a Phase I clinical trial conducted at Duke University Medical Center and the s afety 
assessment will be continued in this study.  
14.1 General Methods  
For categorical variables, summary tabulations of the number and percentage of patients within 
each category (with a category for missing data) of the parameter will be presented.  For continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, median, standard de viation, minimum, and 
maximum values will be presented.   
Each data value for all the included patients will be presented using patient data listings, sorted patient number, unless otherwise specified.  
All data summary tabulations will be presented by stud y site and for the overall study 
population, as appropriate. 
14.1.1  Disposition of Subjects  
Demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized for all patients. The total number of patients screened, enrolled, completed and reason for termination wi ll 
be summarized.  
 
14.2 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Feasibility Phase A : The primary objectives for the feasibility trial are: (1) to find a dose 
of LUM015 that generates the highest average T:N , (2) to define the parameters for the 
detection algorithm and (3) to gather safety data.  
 
Feasibility Phase B:  The endpoints for the Feasibility Phase B are: (1) a preliminary 
evaluation of detection algorithm efficacy, and to make adjustments to the detection algorithm if needed, (2) make adjustments to the protocol for the pivotal trial, and (3) collect safety data.  
 
Subjects undergoing lumpectomies will be injected with LUM015 at 1.0 mg/kg .  The 
surgeon will perform standard of care surgery and then use the imaging system to take additional cavity shavings based on the de tection algorithm output. We will recruit 
subjects until we obtain 10 evaluable subjects with positive margins based on histological assessment from the initial shaved margins. This group will allow for a maximum enrollment of up to 50 evaluable subjects based on an estimated positive margin rate of 20%. We believe that this number of subjects to test the detection algorithm will provide enough clinical data to adjust the parameters of the detection algorithm and move forward with the pivotal trial. We will generate an ROC to determine the parameters of the 
detection algorithm to be used in the pivotal trial.

 14.3 Populations for Analysis  
Safety evaluations will be based on all patients who enter the study  including the initial 
five (5) patients who do not receive LUM015, and all the patients that receive LUM015. 
Efficacy evaluations will be based on the group of patients that complete the study.  
14.4 Reporting and Exclusions  
In some cases, there may be a margin shaving with a histological assessment but no fluorescence reading, or vice versa.  Two analyses will be performed.  In a “complete cases” analysis, only the shavings providing both measures will be analyzed.  In a parallel “worst case” analysis, the fluorescence results will be assumed to be wrong.  Both 
analyses will be reported, but the formal success criterion will be based on the complete cases analysis.  
 
14.5 Safety Analysis  
Adverse events  and adverse device effects  will be collected, analyzed and tabulated as 
needed. Serious adverse events (SAE) and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) 
will be tabulated separately  and analyzed with respect to their severity . 
15. PUBLICATION PLAN  
 
The principal investigator has  the intent to publish the results of this study in a peer -reviewed 
journal. The results of this study will be made public within 24 months of the end of the data collection.  
 
The results of this study may be submitted to regulatory authorities in support of product 
clearance. Any results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. 
If this is anticipated, the Principal Investigator agrees to inform Lumicell and to submit  all 
manuscripts or abstracts prior to submissi on. All publications and lectures with any 
reference to the subject  of this agreement need the previous written consent of Lumicell.  
 
Any formal publ ication of the study in  which the input of Lumicell’s  personnel exceeds that 
of conve ntional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the Investigator and 
the appropriate Lumicell s taff. Authorship will be determine d by mutual agreement.

 Appendix A : Protocol for preparation of LUM015 for injection  
 
1 Purpose  
The purpose of this protocol is to describe the dose preparation for the LUM015 Imaging Agent.  
2 Materials  
• LUM015 Formulated, stored frozen ( -20°C)  
• Sterile syringe  
• 0.45% Saline  
3 Methods  
1) After reconstitution, LUM015 should be administered to the patient within 4 hour s when 
stored at room temperature or 24 hours when stored refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C . 
2) Obtain the most recent accurate weight of the subject in kg.   
• Note: If weight is measured in lbs, multiply value by 0.45359 to obtain kg.  
Example: 155lbs=(155*.45359)kg=70.306kg 
3) Calculate total dose for subje ct according to protocol. 
• Example: If dose level is 1.0 mg/kg and weight is 70kg, then dose = 1.0*70=70 mg.  
4) Obtain the required number of vials  to administer the full dose .  Each vial contains 10mg 
LUM015.   
• Example: If 70mg is the required dose, 70/10=7 v ials. 
• Example 2: If the dose level is 1.0 mg/kg and the patient weight is 63 kg, the 
required number of vial for the dose of 63 mg is 63/10 = 6.3; thus 7 vials would be 
needed for this patient. 
5) Allow bottles to acclimate to room temperature.  
6) Using aseptic techniques:  
a) Remove protective cap from vial.  See Figures 1 and 2 below. 
b) Draw 1mL of 0.45% saline into a sterile syringe.  
c) Puncture vial with syringe. 
d) Invert syringe and vial such that vial is located vertically up and syringe is closer 
to the floor. 
e) Draw 1mL of air from the vial into the syringe.  
f) Invert syringe and vial such that vial is located vertically down closer to the floor. 
g) Ensure air in syringe is located at the top, away from the floor. 
h) Push 1mL of fluid into the vial. 
i) Compound will dissolve inst antaneously.  
j) Repeat steps a- i with remaining required vials.  
k) Remove fluid from each vial using one large syringe to combine all required fluid.  Ensure that only the required fluid is obtained as the final concentration is

 10mg/mL.  Example: if 35mg is th e required dose, remove only 35/10=3.5mL total 
fluid from all 4 vials.   
7) Prep the injection site for the subject according to standard procedures.  
8) Ensure the vial is homogeneous in blue color (see Figure 3 below) and that there are no air 
bubbles in the sy ringe.  
9) The IV line must be flushed with 10- 20 mL of saline just prior to injection of LUM015 
and the injection is immediately followed by a saline flush of 10- 20 mL . 
10) Inject slow bolus into the subject (over three minutes). 
11) Discard remaining solution and syringes.  
12) Record subject weight, dose, compound lot number, and expiration date on accompanying subject case report form.  
 
 
4 Caution 
• Ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe prior to injection.

 Appendix B : Breast Specimen Pathology Evaluation for the Feasibility Study with the 
LUM 2.6 Imaging System  
 
1. Final Shaved Margins -  MGH Pathology Breast Description of Workflow  
 
• Breast tissue is excised by the surgeon and removed from the patient.  
 
• Orientation sutures for pertinent margins are placed on the specimen by the 
surgeon.  
 
• The tissue's fluorescent properties are examined by the surgeon or their delegate OR study staff using the Lumicell device.  
 
• The tissue foci with increased fluorescence as observed with the Lumicell device is pa tteed lightly with non- sterile gauze to remove excess blood or tissue fluid, 
then a small amount of purple ink is applied on the specimen by cotton swab (the color purple was chosen because this color is not otherwise used by pathology). A small amount of 5% acetic acid is applied to prevent the ink from seeping into 
tissue crevices.  
 The schematic illustrates such a breast margin.  
  
• The specimen is placed in a container labeled with patient information and site.  
 
• The specimen container(s) are carri ed from the OR to the frozen section lab of 
the surgical pathology laboratory. The routine yellow surgical requisition sheet is filled out by the surgeon and accompanies the tissue sample.  
 
• Pathology staff are made aware of the Lumicell study; they will p rioritize 
accessioning into the surgical pathology database and provide a surgical 
pathology number.  
 
• The pathology staff routinely assigned to do the macroscopic examination of the specimen is most likely a pathologist assistant (PA). In some cases, a res ident 
pathologist will handle the macroscopic examination.  
 
• The macroscopic characteristics of the fresh specimen (size, shape, consistency of the tissue, visible or palpable abnormalities) are dictated into the pathology data system. Most breast shaved margin specimens range in size from  1 to 3 cm 
in largest dimension.

 • Images above show the sequence how a breast specimen with suture for 
orientation (A) is processed in the pathology lab. The schematic indicates a dab 
of purple ink on the TB side of the specimen and subsequent black ink on the 
outer surface  (M side) carrying the suture (B). The fresh tissue is serially 
sectioned (C), and pieces placed in a slotted plastic cassette to be immersed in formalin (D). A microscopic overview indicates invasive carcinoma close to the inked margin (arrows).  
 
• The outer surface of the shaved margin specimen that carries a suture and 
indicates the new final margin as per the surgeon's instructions is now inked black.  
 
• The specimen is serially sectioned along its long axis, perpendicular to the inked surface. Each of these newly obtained fragments is placed in a slotted plastic 
cassette that is labeled with the surgical pathology case number and consecutive block number (e.g. A1, A2 etc.). The blocks with purple ink will be  mentioned in 
the gross description.  
 
• An example of the gross description may read as follows: "Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name --- and unit number ---, is a 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm 
fragment  of breast tissue. One surface has a suture which indicates the new 
margin,  as designated by the surgeon. The specimen has a 1 cm area of 
previously applied purple ink. The surface with the suture is inked black and serially sectioned to reveal yellow -white soft lobulated breast tissue with no 
lesions  grossly  identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes A1- A8, 
with the purple inked tissue in A3 and A4."  
 
• The tissue is submersed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin and fixed for several hours be fore routine processing and transfer into paraffin blocks. Sections of 5 
μm thickness are cut by the MGH Pathology histology lab, automatically stained with hematoxylin and eosin and coverslipped.  
 
• The H&E stained glass slides are microscopically evaluated by the resident and staff pathologists on service to whom the case is assigned. Occasionally, additional sections or special stains have to be done to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. The final diagnosis is reported and immediately available in the electronic medical record. Ancillary studies (for breast cancer: estrogen and 
progesterone receptor, and HER2 immunohistochemistry, as well as HER2 fluorescence in- situ hybridization) are usually ordered by the primary pathologist 
and typically reported as an addendum within the next week.  
 
• Standard grossing procedures as per gross chart are followed throughout the 
Lumicell study. No additional tissue is  submitted if not indicated for clinical / 
diagnostic reasons.

 • Pertinent slides (those with purple ink)  will be retrieved from file after all 
diagnostic work -up is completed by t he assigned staff pathologist.  
 
• The study pathologist s (EB and/or designate) will evaluate the purple- inked 
marks applied by Lumicell and correlate with the histopathologic findings.

 Appendix  C: Selection of 1.0 mg/kg dose for Phase B  
1. Clinical data suggests linear dependency between signal and dose  
During Phase A of the Feasibility Study in breast cancer, Lumicell measured the fluorescence 
signal of tumor and normal tissue in transections of the main lumpectomy guided by a pathologist. The measurements were done in 3 patients at 0 mg/kg (no dose) to determine the autofluorescence signal, and in 5 and 4 patients dosed at 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. Results show that signals from tumor and normal tissue increase linearly with dose ( Figure 7 ). 
 
Figure 7: Data from breast cancer patients in Phase A suggest that signal increases linearly with dose for both 
tumor and normal tissue. Data points show the mean tumor and n ormal tissue signal at each dose (n=3 at 0 
mg/kg, n=5 at 0.5 mg/kg and n=4 at 1.0 mg/kg). Error bars indicate the standard deviation from the mean. Lines 
indicate a linear fit with the goodness of fit represented by R2. 
1.1 Data suggests decreasing tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio as dose decreases  
We determined the tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio (T:N, in the Appendix) from the 
lumpectomy transections and observed that T:N appears to decrease with dose ( Figure 8). Based 
on the observation of linear dependency of signal with dose ( Figure 7) and the decrease of T:N 
with dose, we hypothesize that at 0 mg/kg (no LUM015) T:N corresponds to the contrast from 
autofluorescence signals between tumor and normal tissue (~2.1). As dose increases, the signal from tumor and normal tissue overcomes autofluorescence signal and T:N approaches the contrast obtained by preferential biodistribution and activation of LUM015 in tumor. We used this hypothesis to build a simple model to predict the be havior of T:N with dose as described in 
the following section. 
 
Figure 8: Clinical data from Phase A patients (n=11) suggests that T:N decreases with dose. Each data point 
represents the mean T:N from one patient.

 2. Dose -response mo del for tumor- to-normal signal ratio 
Lumicell has developed a pragmatic model to describe the effect of dose on T:N. The model is 
based upon the following:  
a. A constant background (autofluorescence) from tumor and normal tissue  
b. A fluorescence signal for tumor and normal tissue that increases linearly with dose in our dose range.  
The model for predicting the mean T:N of a population as a function of dose is given by:  
Equation 1 𝑻𝑻:𝑵𝑵𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎 =𝑫𝑫×𝑩𝑩𝑻𝑻+𝑨𝑨𝑻𝑻
𝑫𝑫×𝑩𝑩𝑵𝑵+𝑨𝑨𝑵𝑵  
where D is dose (in mg/kg), B T is tumor signal increment per unit dose, A T is tumor background 
(autofluorescence) signal, B N is normal tissue signal increment per unit dose, and A N is normal 
tissue background (autofluorescence) signal.  
Using the T:N data in Figure 8, we performed a least -squares fit to our model ( Equation 1). 
Results show that our model fits the data ( Figure 9 ). The model predicts that at doses above 1.0 
mg/kg, T:N is essentially constant suggesting that higher doses do not improve performance.  
 
Figure 9: T:N data from Phase A patients (n=11) fit Lumicell’s dose -response model (equation 1). Blue 
dotted lines are plotted to help the  reader to note lower expected T:N at 0.5 mg/kg than at 1.0 mg/kg.  
3. T:N does not give the  whole story: signal variation will dominate at lower doses  
Imaging presents unique challenges due to signal variations across the field of view that are not reflected  in the dose -response curve for T:N. Our data show that as dose decreases, the 
coefficient of variation of tumor and normal tissue signal increases  (Figure 10 , see Ap pendix 
for definition of coefficient of variation). The large variations in signal result in overlap between tumor and normal tissue signal histograms leading to false positives and false negatives, as observed at 0 mg/kg dose in Phase A.

Figure 10: The average coefficient of variation for tumor and normal tissue increases with dose. Data points represent the 
average coefficient of variation of n=3 patients at 0 mg/kg, n=5 patients at 0.5 mg/kg and n=4 patients at 1.0 mg/kg. The 
top and bottom error bars indicate the maximum and minimum values of coefficient of variation, respectively.  
As mentioned in the conference call, Lumicell is keenly aware that T:N is only a surrogate for 
the metrics of false positives and false negatives, w hich are strongly affected by the variations in 
signal from tissue. These metrics require a larger patient population than a dose response curve of T:N would. To comprehend these effects we have characterized the dependence of variance on dose in the following section, leading to our dose selection for Phase B.  
3.1 Model predicts sharp increase of signal variation at doses b elow 0.5 mg/kg  
We used the data from Figure 10 t o develop a model to predict the coefficient of variation as a 
function of dose for both tumor and normal tissue. The variation in signal includes variations due to instrument noise, autofluorescence heterogeneity, tissue heterogeneity and the uneven distr ibution of activated LUM015 in tissue. 
Instead of calculating variance based on these parameters, which are exceedingly difficult to isolate, we used a simple empirical model for estimating the coefficient of variation based on the assumption that the stan dard deviation of signal increases linearly with dose (see Appendix for 
data supporting this assumption). The model for coefficient of variation as a function of dose is shown below:  
Equation 2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖(𝐷𝐷)=𝐶𝐶1,𝑖𝑖×𝐷𝐷+𝐶𝐶2,𝑖𝑖
𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖×𝐷𝐷+𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 
where D is dose (in mg/kg), i  represents either tumor ( T) or normal tissue ( N), and A i and B i are 
the fitted parameters from Equation 1. At low doses, CV i is dominated by a constant standard 
deviation independent of dose (represented by C 2,1.) and the autofluorescence signal ( Ai), also 
independent of dose. At higher doses, CV i is dominated by the dose dependent components due 
to increased signal from activated LUM015 in tissue, until it levels off at C 1,i/Bi. The tumor and 
normal tissue data were used to fit for the model parameters C 1,i and C 2,i. Our simple model 
prediction fits our data well in the dose and signal ranges tested as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11: Our coeffici ent of variation model fits well to the data in Figure 10 and show a sharp increase in 
coefficient of variation below 0.5 mg/kg. Blue dotted lines are plotted to guide the reader to identify the 
“near optimal” dose of 1.0 mg/kg based upon the coefficient of variation in normal tissue.  
The model in Figure 11 shows a sharp increase in coefficient of variation below a dose of 0.5 
mg/kg. This important and critical behavior for selecting a dose is not captured by just measuring the mean T:N. The signal variations observed with auto fluorescence are as large as the signal 
itself, making the endogenous contrast poor.  
Using Figure 11, we estimat e that the “near optimal” dose (based upon the coefficient of 
variation in normal tissue) is 1.0 mg/kg.  
4. Dose selection rationale and plan for Phase B  
Figure 9 shows t he dose -response (T:N) curve falling off below a dose of 0.75 mg/kg and Figure 
11 shows the rapid increase in coefficient of variation below 0.5 mg/kg. The combined 
deterioration of these two metrics below 1.0 mg/kg clearly points to 1.0 mg/kg as the near 
optimal dose. Selecting a dose lower than 1.0 mg/kg increases the chances of finding false 
negatives and false positives. 
Based on the data and rationale presented abo ve, Lumicell proposes to conduct Phase B of the 
feasibility study at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg and not to test additional doses in Phase A.  
5. Future research  
The data from Phase B will be used to design a randomized, multi -center pivotal study that will 
be statistically powered to evaluate the efficacy of the LUM Imaging System for obtaining negative margins compared to standard of care

1. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(Distinguish  research procedures from those that are p art of routine care ). 
 
Study Design/Protocol:  
Individuals interested in our study will complete a basic telephone or in -person health screen to 
verify inclusion/exclusion criteria fo llowed by consenting, history and physical and then sleep 
studies as  outlined in the Figure. Qualifying individuals will come into the lab for the purpose of 
obtaining informed consent  and completing a history and physical . Participants will then  be 
admitted to  the sleep laboratory at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Clinical Research  Unit for a 
contiguous or separated two night stay . The first  two hours will be required initially for set -up and 
anthropometric measurements , and the remainder of the night will be spent monitoring and 
recording sleep and breathing patterns as described b elow and in the Study Procedures section.

Baseline Night : Participants will undergo an  overnight polysomnography (PSG) .  The parameter 
to monitored include  electro encephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electro -oculogram 
(EOG), thoraco -abdominal movements, submental electromyogram (EMG), pulse oximetry,  
continuous blood pressure monitoring (portable probe worn on the finger) , chest movement 
activity (measured  by bio -impedance electrodes placed on the chest)  and airflow  using a 
pnuemotachograph .

Physiology Night : During  this night, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be 
administered via a nasal mask. In the first 90 -120’, nasal pressure will b e titrated  until non-flow 
limited breathing is achieved  and UAO eliminated . The p ressure at non -flow limited breathing is 
considered the ideal treatment pressu re and  participant will remain at this pressure for the rest of 
the night. Pressure and airflow d ata from the titration portion will be used  to calculate  the Pcrit 
10,11,12. The standard PSG parameters listed  above will also be assessed on this night . 
 
In either night, you may receive a sleep aid (Benadryl) if needed to aid sleep initiation.  
 
 
 
 
Addit ional measurements : Participants will undergo arterial pulse wave analysis  (using the 
EndoPAT; described at end of section) the mo rning after the baseline and physiology study . On 
one of the nights, pleural pressure changes will measured continuously using  an esophageal 
catheter (see description of procedure below).  
 
Pressure Catheter :  A thin tube (about the thickness of a strand of spaghetti) will be placed 
through the participant’s  nose into the food tube (esophagus) after numbing the inside of the nose 
with some numbing medicine (such as lidocaine).  This tube allows us to measure pressure 
changes in the lungs.  This procedure will be carried out on both the baseline and physiology 
nights.  
 
Bio-impedance measurement :  Three EKG patches will be placed hori zontally on the chest at the 
level of the armpit. The EKG patches will be connected to an external bio -impedance monitoring 
device which  allow s us to quantify respiratory effort similar to the esophageal pressure swings . 
This procedure will be carried out on both the baseline and physiology nights.  
 
Objective snoring assessment : A mobile device with a microphone will be placed approximately 
60cm from the participant to record snoring sounds.    
 
 
Blood Test : Following, the sleep studies, a venous blood sampl e will be collected  for serum 
biomarkers of aortic wall stress.  
 
Peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT) :  A blood pressure cuff is placed on the non -dominant 
arm while the participant is in the supine pos ition; the contralateral arm is used for control 
comparisons. Measurements will be taken for 5 minutes before, 5 -min during occlusion of the 
brachial artery and for 5 minutes upon release of the cuff. The occlusion will be achieved by  
 
 
inflation of the automated cuff 50 mmHg abo ve systolic blood pressure. Endothelium -mediated 
vasodilation is assessed using a finger pulse wave amplifier (a probe worn on one finger).  
 
 
 
Randomization : It is documented that in the research setting sleep structure is altered 
specifically in the first sleep session due to exposu re to a new sleep environment. Studies with

  multiple sleep study nights are often confounded by  this first night effect phenomenon  16. To 
prevent this potential confounding effect , we will ensure that the order in which participants are 
assigned to a basel ine and physiology night study is randomized.  So that the findings in either 
night  will not be attributed in part to the se quence in which the visits occurred .                          
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Study Statistics  
 
a. Analys es and Sample Size:  
 
Specific Aim 1:  
a. The sample size for th is aim is designed to detect differences in Pcrit between  matched  
groups. Our  published data indicate a ΔPcrit of 1±0.9 cmH 2O as significant clinically. 
Therefore sample size calculations estimat e 15 subjects each in MFS  and control  groups 
necessary  to detect a baseline difference  in Pcrit of 1.0± 0.9 cmH 2O with a power of 85% 
(two-sided  test, with α type 1 error = 0.05 ). These considerations lead us to propose a final 
sample size of 15 MFS patient s and 15 non MFS  controls  (n=30 participants). We will 
recruit 30 MFS and 30  non MFS controls  in total to allow for attrition , sub group analyses  
and missing data.  
 
b. Overnight UAO exposure will be determined by 1) apnea -hypopnea -index (AHI) and b)  a 
composi te measure of pleural pressure swings during  UAO. Wilcoxon non - parametric t -
test compari sons will be used to determine differences in these parameters between MFS 
and matched controls.  
 
Specific Aim 2:  
a. We have estimated the required sample size of 15 in each group to see a difference of 10 
units in hemodynamic parameters between groups at 90% power and a significance alpha 
level of 0.05 15. We will compare hemodynamics (heart rate and pulse pressure) at 
baseline vs CPAP  in pair wise t -test comparisons  after accounting for sleep stage, body 
position and respiratory phase .  
 
 
 
 
 
Stratified r egression analyses will be used to determine whether the magnitude of hemodynamic 
parameters are predicted by genotype (MFS vs non MFS) at baseline and CPAP  after accounting 
for sleep stage, body position and respiratory phase.  
b. We will utilize descriptive  techniques such as scatter plots, correlation analyses to explore 
the relationship between hemodynamic response  to UAO  and measures of aortic disease 
progression  (aortic diam eter, rate of aortic diameter increase in the past five years  and  
augmentation index)  in MFS. This relationship will also be examined using a multivariate

 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Study in Patients with Chorioretinal Vascular Disease to Evaluate an 
Aflibercept (EYLEA®) Prefilled Syringe  
Site Locations  Approximately 2 sites in the United States (US)  
Objectives  The primary objective of the study is to determine if the prefilled syringe 
(PFS) can be used effectively and safely by retina specialists to administer 
the 2  mg dose of aflibercept.  
The secondary objective of the study is to assess ocular safety in the study 
eye. 
Study Design  This is a phase 4, single -arm (2-cohort) , open -label study in patients with 
chorioretinal vascular disease (neovascular age -related macular 
degeneration [AMD], dia betic macular edema [DME], retinal vein occlusion 
[RVO], and diabetic retinopathy [DR] in patients with DME) to evaluate 
handling of the aflibercept PFS.  The study consists of a screening period, a 
single aflibercept treatment, and a follow -up period.   The initial 35 patients 
will now be referred to as cohort 1, and the additional 35 patients will be 
called cohort  2. 
After providing informed consent, patients will be assessed for study 
eligibility at the screening visit, up to 2 weeks before the day 1/baseline visit.  
Screening and the day 1/baseline visit can occur on the same day.  Only 
1 eye will be selected as the study eye.  
At the day 1/baseline visit, patients will undergo safety assessments, and 
will then receive a single dose of study drug, pr epared (retina specialist 
and/or technician) and administered with the PFS by a retina specialist.  
There is a follow -up period of 28 days with a window of -7 days to +14  days, 
during which patients will be evaluated for safety (ocular adverse events 
[AEs] and all [ocular and non -ocular] serious adverse events [SAEs]).  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for a patient is approximately 29 days, excluding 
the screening period.  
End of Study Definition  The end of study is defined as the last visit of the last patient.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Approximately 70 patients will be enrolled, 35 patients in each of 2  cohorts, 
at approximately 2 sites in the US.  
 Target Population:  The study population will include men or women with treatment -naïve or 
previously -treated neovascular AMD, DME, RVO, or DR with DME, in 
whom treatment with aflibercept is indicated.  
                                        VV-RIM-00107449-1.0 Approved - 01 May 2020 GMT-5:00

 Study Drug  
 Dose/Route/Schedule:  The drug product is supplied as a sterile aqueous solution for injection in a 
PFS.  The PFSs are single -use 1  mL glass syringes with a luer connection 
for the needle, and are provided in sealed blister packs.  
Each single -dose PFS provides a usable amount to deliver a single dose of 
2 mg aflibercept in a volume of 50 μL, via intravitreal (IVT) inje ction.  The 
PFS utilized in this study is fully representative of the presentation intended 
for commercialization.  Only 1  eye will be selected as the study eye  
Patients receive a single dose of aflibercept, prepared and administered with 
the PFS, at the d ay 1/baseline visit.  
Endpoints   
 Primary:  The primary endpoint in the study is the number of aflibercept injections 
successfully administered utilizing the PFS.  
 Secondary:  The secondary endpoint is the ocular safety of aflibercept delivered in the 
PFS.   Safety will be measured by the incidence of ocular AEs and SAEs in 
the study eye.  
Procedures and Assessments  Ocular safety procedures will include Best Corrected Visual Acuity 
(BCVA) scale, using the 4 -meter Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy 
Study (ETDRS), intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp examination, indirect 
ophthalmoscopy, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD -
OCT).  
Overall safety will be assessed by evaluation of ocular AEs in the study eye, 
and all (ocular and non -ocular) SA Es. 
Statistical Plan  The sample size of approximately 35 patients per cohort for this study is 
based on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advice, and is not 
determined from power analysis.  
The safety analysis set (SAF) includes all enrolled patients w ho received 
any study drug, and it will be used for all study analyses.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the following 
information:  the number of patients reflected in the calculation (n), mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical or 
ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each 
category.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
The efficacy and safety of intravitreal (IVT) aflibercept has been well characterized across multiple 
indications in numerous clinical trials.  Marketing authorizations have been granted for aflibercept 
(EYLEA®, [aflibercept] injection), in over 108  countries for the treatment of patients with 
neovascular “wet” age -related macular degeneration (AMD) including the United States (US), 
countries in the European Union (EU), Japan, and Australia.  Intravitreal aflibercept injection is 
also approved for the treatment of patients with macular edema following central retinal vein 
occlusion (CRVO) in over 104  countries, macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion 
(BRVO) in over 98  countries, diabetic macular edema (DME) in over  103 countries, and myopic 
choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in over 95 countries.  In addition to neovascular AMD, 
DME, and retinal vein occlusion (RVO), aflibercept is also approved in the US for the treatment 
of diabetic retinopathy (DR).  
Currently, a flibercept is available as a sterile aqueous solution for injection in single -use, glass 
vials.  Each vial provides a usable amount to deliver a single dose of 2 mg aflibercept in a volume 
of 50  μL.  This configuration requires withdrawal of aflibercept us ing a 19 -gauge × 1½ -inch, 5  μM, 
filter needle into a 1 mL syringe.  Prior to injection the filter needle is replaced with 30 -gauge × 
½-inch injection needle.  These steps are performed using aseptic technique.  
To minimize the number of manipulations requir ed to prepare the injection, Regeneron has 
developed a single -use 1 mL glass prefilled syringe (PFS).  Each single -dose, PFS provides a 
usable amount to deliver a single dose of 2  mg aflibercept in a volume of 50  μL. 
This study is intended to investigate i f the PFS allows for successful preparation and administration 
by retina specialists.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to determine if the PFS can be used effectively and safely by 
retina specialists to administer the 2  mg dose of aflibercept.  
2.2. Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of the study is to assess ocular safety in the study eye.  
3. RATIONALE  
3.1. Rationale for Study Design  
This study is intended to confirm that the single -dose PFS supports successful preparat ion and 
administration of an aflibercept injection by retina specialists.  Per regulatory agency feedback, a 
clinical study of at least 30  patients in each of 2 cohorts utilizing each of the proposed commercial 
aflibercept PFS configurations will be conduc ted.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 12 
 CONFIDENTIAL  3.2. Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose proposed for this study is the 2 mg dose of aflibercept approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of neovascular AMD, RVO, DME, and DR in patients 
with DME.  
3.3. Risk -Benefit  
3.3.1.  COVID -19 Pandemi c 
Recognizing that “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on the 
conduct of clinical trials, the Sponsor does not intend to screen any patient in this study in a specific 
location or area until the COVID -19 pandemic is controlle d and such that patients can safely 
participate in the study.   Until then, the Sponsor plans to continue to obtain approvals from Health 
Authorities/Ethics Committees (ECs) to enable initiation of study sites for this study, as allowed 
by local laws and re gulations.  
4. STUDY VARIABLES  
4.1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics will include standard demography (eg, age, race, weight, height, etc), 
disease characteristics including medical and ocular history, and medication history for eac h 
patient.  
4.2. Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
4.2.1.  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint in the study is the number of aflibercept injections successfully administered 
utilizing the PFS.  
4.2.2.  Secondary Endpoint  
The secondary endpoint in the study is the ocular safety o f aflibercept delivered in the PFS.  Safety 
will be measured by the incidence of ocular adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) in the study eye, through day 29.  
5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1. Study Description and Duration  
This is a phase 4, single2 -arm (2-cohort) , open -label study in patients with chorioretinal vascular 
disease (neovascular AMD, DME, RVO, and DR in patients with DME) to evaluate use of the 
aflibercept PFS.  The study consists of a screening period, a single aflibercept treatment, and a

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Th erefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
An AE also includes any wor sening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
 Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death  at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  In-
patient hospitalization is defined as admissio n to a hospital or an emergency room for 
longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital 
stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to 
the development of a new AE as deter mined by the investigator or treating physician.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for Serious Sight -Threatening Ocular Adverse Events  
Criteria for serious s ight-threatening ocular AEs include the following:  
 Substantial, unexplained vision loss, or an AE that causes substantial vision loss.  
 An AE that requires either surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss 
of vision.  
Criteria for reporting S AEs must be followed for these events.  See Section  9.4 for more 
information on recording and reporting SAEs.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all ocular study eye AEs and any SAEs (ocular and 
systemic) that occur from the time the informed consent is signed until the end of study.  Refer to 
the study reference manual for the procedures to  be followed.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.5 . 
9.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours.  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedure to 
be followed.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report.  
Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical records and diagnostic test reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will apply:  
 SAE with an on set within 30 days of the end of study or early termination visit - the 
SAE will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to 
obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.  
 SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/early termination 
visit - only fatal SAEs and those deemed by the investigator to be drug -related SAEs 
will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24  hours of  learning 
of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if 
associated with an AE,  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not consid ered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female  or female partner of a male , during the study 
or within 90  days of the last dose of study drug.  Any complication of pregnancy 
affecting a female study patient or female partner of a male study patient, and/or 
fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE.  
Outcome for all p regnancies should be reported to the sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI):   No AESIs have been defined for this study.

Medical/Study Director within 30 days.  
Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed.  
9.4.5.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected  until the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient normal functioning level.  It may 
be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may be 
given because of personality of the pati ent. 
Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a defin ite hazard 
to the subject’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospitalized.  
9.5.2.  Evaluation of Causality  
Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by the investigator, and will be a clinical 
decision based on all available information.  The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study drug?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possib ility that the event may have been caused by the 
study drug  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study 
drug

and dating the ICF.  
 Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will  have the ICF 
read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to 
confirm that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed  ICF must be given to the patient.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF must 
be reviewed and updated appropriately.  All study patients must be informed of the new 
information and provide their wr itten consent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original 
signed revised ICF must be maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to 
the patient.

Study Protocol  
1.  Study Title:  Mechanisms of Refractory Hypertension (Reserpine)  
2.  Hypothesis:  Reserpine, a potent sympatholytic agent will substantially reduce blood 
pressure (BP) in patients with refractory hypertension.  
3.  Inclusion Criteria:  Patients (age 19 -80 years) referred to UAB Hypertension Clinic with 
refractory hypertension defined as uncontrolled office BP adherent with 5 or more 
antihypertensive agents, including  a long -acting thiazide diuretic and spironolactone.  
4.  Exclusion Criteria:  chronic kidney disease (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 mm), pregnancy  
4.  Primary Endpoint:  Change in 24 -hr ambulatory systolic BP  
5.  Study design:  Subjects will be withdrawn from centr ally-acting alpha -1 agonists agents (i.e., 
clonidine, guanfacine) over a 1 -2-week  period, if appropriate.  A baseline 24 -hr ambulatory BP 
monitoring will be done with subjects taking all of their normally prescribed antihypertensive 
agents.  Subjects will then be dispensed reserpine 0.1 mg in open -label fashion to be taken daily 
for 4 -weeks.  At the end of the 4 -week treatment period the 24 -hr ambulatory monitoring will 
be repeated.  
6.  Statistical Plan: The protocol will be done as a proof -of-concept.  Val ues will be presented as 
mean+/ -standard deviation.  Change in 24-hr ambulatory systolic BP from baseline to end -of-
treatment will be compared by pair ed T-test.  
7.  Publication Plan:  Study results will be presented at national hypertension meetings and 
submitted to a peer -reviewed medical journal for consideration of publication.

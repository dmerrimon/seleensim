3.2  Discussion of Study Design 
This is a ra
ndomized, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled, single administration, multiple-dose, 
Phase IIb study to evaluate the efficacy of MM-II administered by a single IA joint injection of 
either MM-II or placebo in subjects with sy mptomatic knee OA. The study has been developed 
based on design features used in the completed  first-in-human study for the symptomatic knee 
OA indication. The primary efficacy endpoint is based on the change from Baseline of WOMAC 
A pain score. Secondary efficacy endpoints ar e based on evaluation of other measures of pain 
scores, disease activity scores, and weekly cumu lative exposure to rescue medication, which are 
all accepted measures for the evaluation of clinical outcome.

3.3.2 Rationale for Study 
Osteoarthritis of the knees is the most common form of arthritis, both inflammatory
 and non-
inflammatory in nature, partic ularly after the age of 45. The pathophysiology of OA is poorly 
understood. Therefore, currently available medication regimens for OA, including non-opioid 
analgesics such as acetaminophen/paracetamol and NSAIDs, focus on providing transient 
palliative anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving bene fits for OA, as opposed to curative effects.  
However, long-term use of these agents is associated  with a wide range of side effects involving 
multi-organ systems. Furthermore, these agents have often provided limited and temporary pain 
relief. Therefore, effective and safer alternative treatments for OA are urgently needed.  This 
Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled, single-administration, multiple-dose 
study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of MM-II for treatment of knee pain, 
and to identify an optimal dose in a large popul ation of subjects with symptomatic knee OA.  
The subjects in the proposed study will receive either MM-II (1 mL, 3 mL, or 6 mL) or placebo 
(1 mL, 3 mL, or 6 mL) in a single IA joint injection of the knee.  
3.3.3 Risk/Benefit and Ethical Assessment 
Given that efficacy benefits were reported for subjects with concurrent OA in the completed 
first- in-human study in symptomatic knee OA, there is an expectation that MM-II will improve 
OA knee pain and measures of quality of life in  a larger OA subject population at Week 12.  
Furthermore, rescue medication is allowed for  additional pain control during the study for 
subjects who experience breakthrough knee pain caused by knee OA.  
The study has also been designed to minimize  potential risks to subjects; all subjects will 
undergo screening procedures aimed at reducing th e likelihood and impact of any such risks, for 
example, subjects on anticoagulation or have a hi story of coagulopathy are excluded from this 
study due to a need for IA knee injection.  In addition, regular safety monitoring during the 
evaluation period for all subjects will ensure th at any unanticipated effects of study participation 
are identified promptly and managed appropriately. 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review selected data across the 
study.  The DSMB in conjunction with the Sponsor is empowered to make recommendations 
regarding continuation, termination or modi fication of the study, as appropriate. 
Overall, based on data from non-clinical and clin ical studies of MM-II to date and the risk 
minimization strategies discussed above, the risk : benefit profile of the current study is 
considered acceptable.

5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
5.1.1 Description 
This is a 27-week, phase IIb, randomize d, double-blind, placebo-controlled single-
administration, multiple-dose study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single IA joint 
injection of MM-II in subjects with sympto matic knee OA who have failed to respond 
adequately to simple analgesics as compared to matching placebo.  The design of the study is 
illustrated in Figure 5-1 below.  The study w ill be multinational and performed in a number 
of study centers.  Screening of subjects for eligib ility will take place during a period of up to 28 
days, followed by randomization and a single IA  joint injection of the index knee on Day 0 
(Week 0) and then a 26-week follow-up period.   
 Approximately 348 subjects wi th symptomatic knee OA will be randomized to 
receive a single IA injection of MM-II or placebo into the index knee at a volume of 1 mL, 3 mL, or 6 mL in this study.  
 
 
 
 
n the Standard Protocol for IA 
Injection.  The subject is 
blinde d for the duration of the study. 
The primary endpoint is the change from Base line in WOMAC A pain score (See Appendix 
18.2) at Week 12.  Secondary efficacy endpoints will include change fr om Baseline WOMAC A 
score at Week 26, WOMAC stiffness and disabili ty sub-scores at Weeks 12, 26, and over time, 
knee joint pain by VAS at measured time points, global pain score by VAS at measured time 
points, the weekly cumulative amount of rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol) used, 
and PtGA of disease activity.

 Should a situation arise where unblinding is required, the Investigator at that site may perform 
immediate unblinding via the IWRS with or wi thout following an attempt for communication 
with the Sponsor depending on local legislature. This can only occur in emergency situations 
(Section 6.4). 
 
 
 
6.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomization Code 
Subjects, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will remain 
blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until all subjects complete 
their double-blind follow-up (Week 26 visit) and the study database has been cleaned and 
locked. 
Emergency treatment code breaks should only be unde rtaken when it is essential to treat the 
subject safely and efficaciously. Most often, knowl edge of the possible treatment assignments is 
sufficient to treat a study subject who presents  with an emergency condition. Emergency code 
breaks are performed using the IWRS. The de tailed procedure of emergency code breaking and 
unblinding the subject is described in the eCRF /IWRS completion guideline available to study 
site and staff prior to study start.

7.1.2 WOMAC Evaluation of Knee Osteoarthritis 
The current WOMAC survey is comprised of 24 items divided into three subscales: Pain (5 
items), stiffness (2 items), and physical functi on (17 items). Subjects are asked a range of 
questions about their knee pain, knee stiffness, their  ability to carry out daily activities such as 
using the stairs, rising from sitting, lying in bed and conducting light or heavy domestic duties. 
All the items are scored on a scale of 0-4 (lower  scores indicate lower levels of symptoms or 
physical disability). Values are summed up for a combined WOMAC score (WOMAC total 
score) or subscores (WOMAC A pain  score, etc), and means can be calculated for total and 
subscores on the 0-4 scale. This is a comm on method used, although other aggregation methods 
have been used. The higher the score, the higher the amount of pain, stiffness, and a high level of 
functional limitations.

8.2  Definitions  
8.2.1 Adverse Event/Reaction 
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical  occurrence in a subject, or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigation product, whether or 
not related to the investigational product”.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
An adverse treatment reaction is an “untoward and unintended response to an IP related to any 
dose administered”.  All AEs judged by either the reporti ng Investigator or the Sponsor as having 
a reasonable causal relationship to an IP qualify  as adverse treatment reactions.  The expression 
of “reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are facts or arguments 
which suggest a causal relationship. 
8.2.2 Serious Adverse Event 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose 
x results in death 
x is life-threatening 
x requires in-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization* 
x results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x important medical event: Important medical events that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered as SAEs when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the out comes listed above. Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intens ive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.), convulsions that do not result in hospitaliz ation, or the development of treatment 
dependency or treatment abuse.

 Possibly A clinical event, including 
laboratory test abnormality, with 
a reasonable time sequence to  administration of the treatment, 
but which could also be 
explained by concurrent disease 
or other treatment
s or chemicals. 
Information on treatment  
withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear. 1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the treatment . 
2.  It could also be explained by patient's concurrent 
disease, environmental factors, medical hi story and 
other concomitant treatment s or chemicals (including 
food-treatment interactions). 
3. There is no information or uncertainty with regard 
to what has happened after stopping the treatment . 
Probably A clinical event, including 
laboratory test abnormality, with 
a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the treatment, 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other 
treatment
s or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically 
reasonable response on 
withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not 
required to fulfil this definition. 1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the treatment . 
2. It could not be readily explained (unlikely) by the 
patient’s concurrent disease, environmental factors, 
medical hi story and other concomitant treatments or 
chemicals including food -treatment interactions. 
3. It disappears or decreases in severity on cessation 
or reduction in dose or on administration of a specific 
antagonist wherever possible. There are important 
exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the treatment , yet treatment 
relatedness clearly exists.  
4. No rechallenge information is available or possible. 
Certainly A clinical event, including 
laboratory test abnormality, 
occurring in a plau sible time 
relationship to treatment 
administration, and which cannot 
be explained by concurrent 
disease or other treatments or 
chemicals. The re sponse to 
withdrawal of the treatment  
(dechallenge) should be clinically 
plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary.
 1. It follows a plausible time sequence to treatment 
intake, this means that there is a positive argument in 
sufficient detail to support the view that the tr eatment 
is causally involved, pharmacologically or 
pathologically e.g. pharmacokinetics and type of 
reaction.  
2. It could not be explained by patient's concurrent 
disease, environmental factors, medical history and 
other concomitant treatment s or chemicals including 
food-treatment interactions (i.e. no alternative causes). 
3. It disappears or decreases in severity on cessation 
or reduction in dose or on administration of a specific 
antagonist wherever possible.  
4. It is an objective and specific medical disorder or a 
recognized pharmacological phenomenon for instance 
‘grey baby syndrome’ and chloramphenicol or anaphylaxis immediately after the administration of a 
treatment
 that had been given previously. This means 
that any other event is automatically exclu ded and 
can never qualify for ‘Certain’ (even in the case of a 
positive rechallenge observation).  
5. It reappears  on readministration of the treatment 
(only if ethically correct i.e. in case of non -serious, 
and easily treatable AEs).

 Assessments of Unlikely and Unrelated do not meet the threshold for reasonable suspected 
causal relationship and are therefore classified as Unrelated for regulatory reporting and 
within a binary scale of Related/Not Related. 
The Investigator should consider the following before reaching a decision on causality 
assessment: 
x Time relationship between IP use and event’s onset 
x Medical history 
x Study treatment 
x Mechanism of action of IP 
x Class effect 
x Concomitant treatments in use 
x Lack of efficacy/worsening of existing condition 
x Erroneous treatment with study treatment or concomitant medication 
x Protocol-related process 
8.4 Assessment of severity, outcome and expectedness of Adverse Events 
The severity of an AE will be characterized as: 
x Mild: AE which is easily tolerated 
x Moderate: AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity. 
x Severe:  AE, which prevents normal daily activities. 
x Life-threatening: The subject is at risk of d eath due to the AE as it occurred. This does 
not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
x Death: Death related to AE 
Event outcome is categorized as: fatal, resolved, resolved with sequelae, resolving, not resolved, 
or unknown.  
Action taken with respect to study treatment due to an AE is categ orized as: none, unknown, or 
not applicable. 
Other actions taken are categorized as: none, specific therapy/medication, surgical medical 
procedure, or (Prolonged) hospitalization. 
Assessment of Expectedness will be determined by the version of the IB effective at the time of 
onset of the adverse event 
8.5 Eliciting, Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events 
Information on AEs will be derived by questioning the subjects in general terms (e.g. "How do 
you feel?” or “How have you been feeling since the last questioning?” respectiv ely), by subjects' 
spontaneous reports, or by observation. 
AEs will be documented on the source document. Tr ained monitors will check the entries on the 
source document. The AE will be transcri bed to the AE eCRF-sections. The following 
information will be given for each AE: Descript ion of the AE, start date, stop date, severity, 

Protocol CLR_17_17   Amendment 2 – 18 Jun 2021 
  MM-II  
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  Page 59 of 81 
 pattern, action taken, outcome, seriousness, dose of study treatment, and relationship to the study 
treatments. The dose of study treatment assigned  to an AE will be the dose the subject was 
assigned to take on the date the subject reported the AE first began.   
8.6  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest 
All SAEs must be reported according to ICH guidelines on GCP or local regulations, applying 
the regulation with the stricter requirements. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
All AEs/SAEs will be recorded on the AE Report Form in the eCRF and source documents.  The 
Investigator is responsible for informing the IEC or IRB of the SAE as per local requirements. 
SAE forms should be completed at the site and faxed/emailed to the relevant Sponsor / 
designated CRO or emailed to the global email dist ribution list within 24 hours of awareness of 
the event.  The Investigator is responsible for informing the IEC or IRB of the SAE as per local 
requirements. 
SAE and AESI reports should be sent to: 
Central Receipt mail box:  
If the report is sent via email then the comp leted and signed SAE or Pregnancy Report Form 
must be attached to the email.  A notification email of the event de scribing it in the email text is 
not sufficient. 
There may be situations when an SAE (or AESI ) has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial SAE report .  However, it is very important that the 
Investigator always makes an assessment of causal ity for every event prior to transmission of the 
SAE Report Form. Minimum criteria are identifiab le subject (number), a suspect product (i.e., IP 
or concomitant medication), an identifiable reporting source (Investigator/study site 
identification), and an event or outcome that can be  identified as serious.  The Investigator may 
change his/her opinion of causality in the li ght of follow-up information, amending the SAE 
report form accordingly.  The causality assess ment is the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs.

representatives within 1 business day or 3 calendar days (whichever is earlier) of becoming 
aware of it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.6.1.2 Safety Reporting to Health Authorities, Independent Ethics 
Committees/Institutional Review Boards and Investigators 
Designated CRO will notify the Sponsor or de signee of any SAE and will perform follow-up 
activities with the concerned site.  The Sponsor wi ll bear responsibility of expedited and periodic 
reporting to the Health Authorities according to national requirements. 
The Investigator must comply with any applicable site-specific requirements related to the reporting of SAEs (particularly deaths) to the IEC/IRB that approved the study.  Investigators should provide written documentation of IEC/IRB notif ication for each report to the Designated 
CRO. 
In accordance with ICH GCP, Designated CRO  will inform the Investigators of findings that 
could adversely affect the safety of patients , impact the conduct of the study, or alter the 
IEC’s/IRB’s approval/favorable opinion to continue the study, as assessed by the Sponsor.  In 
particular and in line with re spective regulations, Designated CRO will inform the Investigators 
of SAEs.  The Investigator should place copies of Safety Reports in the Investigator Site File.  
National regulations with regard to Safety Report not ifications to Investigators will be taken into 
account. 
When specifically required by regulations a nd guidelines, the Sponsor will provide appropriate 
Safety Reports directly to the concerned lea d IEC/IRB and will maintain records of these 
notifications.  When direct reporting is not clearly defined by national or site-specific 
regulations, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly notifying the concerned IEC/IRB of 
any Safety Reports provided by the Sponsor and of filing copies of all related correspondence in 
the Investigator Site File.

 13 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
13.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling 
All required study data must be entered in the e CRF created for the study.  This data collection 
tool is a validated electronic data capture (EDC) system that contains a system generated audit 
trail.  Data required according to this protocol ar e recorded by investigational site personnel via 
data entry into the internet based EDC software system.  The Investigator shall ensure that all 
data from subject visits are promptly entered in to the eCRFs in accordance with the specific 
instructions given. The Investigator must sign each  eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded. All internal Sponsor/de signated CRO and external inve stigational site personnel 
seeking access to the eCRF are supported by th e CRO data manager. At the end of the study all 
data captured electronically will be provided to the Investigator for archiving at the 
investigational site. 
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be collated prior to study start.   If a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all sa mples be analyzed at that laboratory, unless 
otherwise specified (e.g., ESR). The Investigator must maintain source documents, such as laboratory reports, X-rays, ECGs, 
consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports. All 
information in the eCRF must be traceable to the source documents in the subject’s file.  
13.2 Retention of Essential Documents 
The Investigator/institution should maintain the study documents as specified in the ICH guidelines on GCP and as required by the applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents. 
Essential documents should be retained until at  least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the IP . These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by the applic able regulatory requirements or by an agreement 
with the Sponsor.  It is the responsibility of th e Sponsor to inform the Investigator/institution as 
to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  Page 75 of 81 
 14 FINANCING AND INSURANCE 
The Sponsor shall carry an insurance policy to cover compensation of subjects’ health injuries 
arising from the study.  If a subject incurs a st udy-related injury, the subject may be treated (and 
other necessary measures taken) at the study site and/or another medical institution.  If it is 
necessary to compensate for the treatment, the Sponsor will cover the cost.  The Sponsor shall 
not impose on the subject the burden of proving the causal relation between the study and the 
injury. 
If any of the following is confirmed, the Sponsor may refuse or restrict the payment of the 
compensation: 
1. A serious GCP or protocol deviation by the Investigator or Sub-Investigator (except 
deviation medically necessary to avoid an immediate hazard to the study subjects) 
2. Intentional act or negligence on the part of the Investigator or Sub-Investigator or 
malpractice thereby 
3. Injury caused by unlawful act or delinquency of a third party 
4. Injury caused by intentional act or negligence of the subject 
If compensation becomes necessary for a study-re lated injury, the site will promptly notify the 
Sponsor and will co-operate with the Sponsor and its insurer (or their legal representatives) in 
their handling thereof.

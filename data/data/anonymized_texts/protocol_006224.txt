4.0 INVESTIGATORS AND STUDY ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE  
This is a multiple site prospective assessment  of the study product in ICU settings. The 
study is comprised of each subject we aring one study product until the device either needs to 
be changed or is no longer required by the subject.   
5.0 BACKGROUND/RATIONALE  
Endotracheal intubation is the placement of a flexible tube into the trachea via the nose or 
mouth , primarily the mouth. The  primary purpose of intubation is to establish and maintain  

 
 
Clinical Protocol: 5855 -I 
Assessment of  ET Tube Fastener   
 
Company Confidential   5 
an open  airway for the patient.   ET tube  secur ement  with a fastener is critical for 
management of a patient with an ET tube  in the ICU settings.   
 
The current commercially available  provides a convenient way to hold an oral ET tube 
securely i n place with an integrated tube protect ion sleeve .  The  protect ion sleeve  is 
designed to accommodate the standard ET  tube sized 5 .0-10.0mm.  Multiple ET tubes with 
subglottic suction capabilit ies are on the market and the current AnchorFast  products do not 
easily accommodate these tubes. With the advent and usage of these ET types in the ICUs, 
 
 device with tube protection sleeve 
has been designed to hold both the standard ET tube sized 5 .0-9.0mm and  ET tube with  
integrated subglottic suction  capability  sized 6 .0-8.0mm.  
 
This study is designed  to assess the acceptability and usability of the study product by  
clinicians caring for an orally intubated patient using an  ET tube with integrated subglottic 
suction capability.

Unanticipated Adverse Events  
An unanticipated adverse event occurs when the nature, severity or frequency of the event is 
not consiste nt with the known or foreseeable risk of the anticipated adverse events 
associated with the study product  or procedures involved with this research.    
 
Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is one that results in death, results in life -threatening  illness or 
injury, requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in 
medical intervention to prevent permanent impairment,  or results in permanent impairmen t 
of body structure or function , or that result in injury or death  to a fetus .   There are no 
serious adverse related to the study product  anticipated in this study.  
 
Handling of Adverse Events  
The Investigator  or designee  will determine if an adverse event has occurred and if it was 
related to the study product .  Adver se events are documented on  
 within the EDC system.  The Investigator  or designee  indicates if the adverse 
event is related to the study  product  by marking “possibly”, “probably”, or “definitely” on 
the Adverse Event F orm.   
 
All Adverse Events are followed to determine resolution  as prescribed by  the hospital’s 
standard of care  and the Adverse Event form is updated to indicate date of resolution.  If at 
any point, the Investigator  or designee  determines the subject should no  longer use the study 
product , the subject should be discontinued from the study . 
 
Reporting of Adverse Events  
Unanticipated and serious adverse events  related to the study product  must be reported by 
the Investigator  or designee  through the EDC system  within 24 hours by documenting on 
. 
 
Unanticipated or s erious adverse events related to the study product must be  promptly  
reported to the EC or IRB , per their reporting procedures.  
12.0 DATA MANAGEMENT  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the 
Case Report Forms.   It is the responsibility of the Investigator and the monitor to resolve 
any data queries recorded in the CRFs.  All attachments are collected by the Sponsor except 
 
 
The Sponsor implement s edit checks on the eCRF to enforce data entry guidelines, data 
consistency, and compliance to the protocol and regulatory requirements.  The Investigat or 
or designee is responsible for entering study data into the EDC system .  The Sponsor track s 
eCRFs and review s them for completeness, the presence of mandatory values, consistency, 
and dated electronic signatures.  The Sponsor generate s data clarificatio n queries during the 
review process to ensure data quality.  Once the Investigator or designee have provided 

 
 
Clinical Protocol: 5855 -I 
Assessment of  ET Tube Fastener   
 
Company Confidential   12 
acceptable responses to the queries and implemented the changes on the eCRFs, the Sponsor 
closes  the queries with the appropriate resolution status .  At the end of the study, the 
database is locked and the data is released for reporting and statistical analysis.  
 
All required signatures on the eCRF are provided electronically by the Investigator or 
designee.   Access to the eCRF for data entry and sig nature is controlled by user 
identification and password, which are provided by the Sponsor or designee. Investigators 
and their personnel are trained, by Sponsor and/or a designated CRO , in the use of eCRFs 
and application of electronic signatures before the start of the study.  
 
Because it is extremely important to have proper data collection in a timely manner, the 
Investigator or designee and subjects complete the eCRFs on an ongoing basis.   It is 
expected that the eCRFs for a particular subject are reviewed and completed by the 
Investigator  or designee  within  hours of study product application and within  hours of 
study product removal.    
 
The Investigator or designee enters the data into the EDC system and retains the original 
source documents in the study binder for the monitor to perform source document 
verification  as needed . The Investigator agrees to maintain all study files in a secure location 
for a minimum of two years.  
13.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
13.1 DATA ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIVE  
Study data will be pres ented in their entirety or summarized using simple descriptive 
statistics; any open comments obtained will be provided without analysis or 
interpretation.   No hypothesis tests, inferences to any population or any other statistical 
analyses are planned.  
 
 
The objective will be assessed via questionnaire items relating to product application, 
 and product removal. 
Overall acceptability relating to general experience with the study product will also be 
ascertained.  
 
13.2 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER  
The sample size of 30 was chosen based on a literature revi ew of two comparable sample 
size studies . Both studies aimed at comparing effectiveness of ET tube  securement 
techniques.  In the first study, a power analysis was performed before patient enrollme nt that 
determined 17 patients would need to be enrolled to show a difference of one standard 
deviation from the mean between the two fixation techniques at 80% power and 5% type 1 
error. The sample size of 30 patients was chose n to increase the power of  results and include 
a larger variety of patients undergoing different surgical procedures1. The second study, a 
randomized controlled study, included a sample of 90 patients with 30 in each arm  to

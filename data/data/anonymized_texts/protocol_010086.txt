PROC SEQDESIGN in SAS (SAS® software versio n 9.2 or higher) was used for the 
sample size calculat ion.With a 2:1 randomizat ion of terlipressin to placebo and an 
interim analysis after 50% of the subjects have completed Day  14 or Di scharge, 
300subjects will provide 9089.76% power to detect a statist ically significant 
difference between the groups .
6.  Secti on 6.1.1 was modified as fo llows:
Incidence of verified HRS reversal, defined as the percentage of subjects wi th 
2consecutive SCr values no m ore than 1.5 m g/dL at least 2 hours apart, while on 
treatm ent by  Day 14 or discharge (on tr eatment defined as up to 24 hours after the 
final dose of study drug).
7.  Secti on 8.1was m odified as fo llows:
Subjects with a baseline SCr level greater than 7.0 mg/dL  will be excluded from  the study .
In thi s study , the threshol d for the upper cut of SCr will be set to exclude subjects with 
SCr> 6mg/dL. The threshold for u pper cut -off of SCr in entry criteria is derived fr om the 
results of pr evious NDA studies. In OT -0401, none of the subjects w ith a baseline SCr level 
greater than 7.0mg/dL achieved HRS r eversal. Subjects w ill be stratified by qualifying 
SCr ( less than 3.4mg/dL or at least 3.4 mg/dL).
where, across individual studies as well as in the pooled analysis, subjects with SCr of 
≤ 6mg/dL  have shown a m uch greater likelihood of achieving HRS reversal than subjects 
withSCr > 6 mg/dL. Pooling the OT 0401 and REVE RSE studies resulted in 11.1% (1/9) 
of subjects wi th SCr > 6mg/dL  achieving HRS reversal and 37.4% (49/131) of subjects 
with SCr ≤ 6 m g/dL achieving HRS reversal. The aim o f lowering the upper cut off is to 
minimize exposure to terlipressin in subjects wi th high SCr who m ay not receive as much 
benefit to therapy  but still be exposed to the risks of the therapy .Subjects will be stratified 
by qualifying SCr ( less than 3.4 mg/dL or at least 3.4 mg/dL).
Qualifying SCr is a pr ognostic factor for survival and H RS reversal. Excluding subjects 
with a baseline SCr of greater than 6 7mg/dL and LVP at least 4 L within 2 days prior to

Type 1 recurrence is another episode of HRS T ype 1 as per the protocol 
inclusio n/excl usion criteria.  HRS r ecurrence by Day 30 is defined as another episode 
ofHRS T ype 1, by Day 30, after achieving verified HRS r eversal, characterized by rapidly 
progr essive w orsening in r enal function to a SCr at least 2.25 mg/dL, w ithout sustained 
improvement in r enal function ( less than 20% decr ease in SCr and SCr at least 2.25 
mg/dL) at least 48 hours after diur etic w ithdr awal and the beginning of plasma volume 
expansion w ithalbumin, and meeting all other inclusion and exclusion criteria defining 
the initial diagnosis of HRS T ype 1. Theinvest igator will determine whether the subject 
has had a recurrence o f HRS T ype 1. If the invest igator cannot exclude a recurrence o f 
HRS T ype1, then the subject will be considered to have HRS T ype 1 recurrence.
HRS T ype 1 recurrence will be monitored as fo llows: Recurrence of HRS T ype 1 
during the follow-up peri od (after discharge or Day  14) will be assessed based upon the 
investigator ’s opini on and seri ous AE data collected up to 30 days after end of treatment. 
Following the init ial hospi tal discharge, all re -hospi talizati ons wi thin 30 days after end 
oftreatm ent (except for pl anned hospi tal admissio ns or procedures as described in the 
protocol ) are to be recorded as an SAE. Re -hospitalizat ions will require an invest igator 
assessment and opinio n regarding possible recurrence o f HRS T ype 1. All available 
relevant medical r ecords, MedW atch f orms, dischar ge summaries or other r elevant sour ce 
documents should be requested and r eviewed for all SAEs, including all hospitalizations,

Based on REVERSE , subjects without a known event of pre -enrollment LVP at least 4 L within 2 days of 
randomization and OT -0401 subjects with baseline SCr no more than 7 mg/dL. SCr values were included while 
the subjects were on treatment, up to 7224hours after the final dose of study drug. SCr values were excluded 
after RRT and transplant. If a subject died within 10 days after the reversal, then the subject did not have a 
reversal. If a subject has an RRT by the 30-da y follow -up visit, then the subject did not have a reversal. Three 
REVERSE terlipressin subjects who achieved a reversal after the 24 hour window were counted as reversals 
because they would have continued on study drug based on the CONFIRM trial design th rough the reversal.
PROC SEQDESIGN in SAS (SAS®software version 9.2 or higher) was used for the 
sample size calculat ion. The SAS code and SAS output are in Section 23.With a 2:1 
rando mizat ion of terlipressin to placebo and an interim analysis after 50% of the subjects 
have co mpleted Day  14 or Di scharge, 300subjects will provide 90 89.76 % power to 
detect a statist ically significant difference between the groups, 200subjects in

Investigational Product , Dosage and Mode of Administration :
Single -use, sterile 6 -mL vials containing 1 mg of lyophilized terlipressin acetate (equivalent to 0.85 mg 
terlipressin free base) wit h 10 mg mannitol as a bulking agent/stabilizer. Each vial will be reconstituted 
with 5mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:
Matching placebo vials (containing 11 mg mannitol) that are identical in appearance to terlipressin for injection 
vials. Each vial will be reconstituted with 5 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
The following dosing scheme will be utilized for both terlipressin and matching placebo:
Initial Dosing:
Blinded terlipre ssin or placebo will be administered intravenously as a bolus injection over 2 minutes at a dose 
of 1 mg (1 vial) every 6 hours (± 30 minutes).
Dose Modifications:
If SCr has decreased, but by less than 30% from the baseline value on Day 4 after a minimum of 10 doses 
of study drug , the dose of study drug will be increased to 2 mg ever y 6 hours (± 30minutes) (8 mg/day). 
The dose should not be increased in subjects with coronary artery disease or in the setting of circulatory 
overload, pulmonary edema, or b ronchospasm. 
If dosing is interrupted due to an adverse event, study drug may be re -started, at the discretion of the 
investigator, at the same or lower dose as per protocol. Study drug will not be restarted if dosing 
wasinterrupted due to cardiac ischem ia or mesenteric ischemia .
If in the investigator’s judgment, a dose increase is not advisable or otherwise justified in the individual 
subject, the reason(s) for not increasing the dose of study drug will be documented on the electronic case 
report form ( eCRF).
Treatment Discontinuation:
Treatment should be continued until 24 hours after a second consecutive SCr value no more than 1.5 mg/dL has 
been obtained, OR up to a maximum of 14 days (maximum of 15 days if SCr first reaches 1.5 mg/dL on 
Day 14). 
If on Day  4 (after a minimum of 10 doses ) SCr is at or above baseline value, study drug should be discontinued .
Treatment must be discontinued when the subject is to undergo RRT, liver transplantation , TIPS or vasopressor

Dosing must be permanently d iscontinued if an event of cardiac ischemia or mesenteric ischemia occurs .
Retreatment:
If judged by the investigator to be potentially beneficial, subjects who demonstrate at least a partial response 
during the initial treatment course ( at least 30% reduc tion in SCr) who develop recurrence of HRS Type 1 
during the study or follow -up period may  be retreated with initially assigned blinded study drug for a maximum 
of 14 days (from the beginning of the retreatment, treatment and study procedures will be ident ical to the initial 
therapy ). To qualify for retreatment the subject must again meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
thesponsor must be contacted prior to initiation of retreatment . Retreatment may occur within 90 days of 
thesubject’s first do se of study  drug .Subjects willnot be re-randomized or re-stratified for the retreatment 
cycle.
Duration of Treatment :
The active treatment period will be 14 days (exception: 15 days as described above), allowing 1retreatment 
cycle. Subjects will have a scheduled follow -up visit for Day 30 (±10) , and will be contacted by phone for 
Day 60(±14), andDay 90(±14) .

5.1 Hepatorenal Syndrome
Hepatorenal syndro me (HRS) T ype 1, a potentially reversible renal failure, is a serious, 
rapidly progressing, fatal  orphan disease com plicating decom pensated chronic liver disease 
associ ated wi th cirrhosi s (Arroy oet al, 1996; Salerno et al, 2007; Angeli et al, 2015). 
Theestimated United States (US) annual incidence for HRS T ype 1 ranges between 9,000 
and20,000 pati
ents ( Marrero , 2003; Muir , 2002; Murkerj eeet al, 2002 ;National Hospital 
Discharge Survey  2005 ), establishing it as an orphan disease. The death rate from chronic 
liver di sease and cirrhosis has been rising, while the death rates for other major diseases 
such as stroke, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes have gone down in the past 15 years 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion 2013 ; Maet al, 2015). 
As indicated in the American Associat ion for the Study  of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 
Guidelines, at present, there is no available pharmacological the rapy (ie, approved or proven) 
in the US or Canada for HRS T ype 1 
(Runyo n, 2013) and there remains a significant unmet 
need. 
An increasing body  of knowl edge of  the pathophy siology of HRS T ype 1 has demo nstrated 
that vasocon strictive drug therapy  may improve renal funct ion in HRS T ype 1 
(Salerno et al,
2007; European Associ ation for the Study of the Liver 2010). T erlipressin has been 
extens ively  studied as a spl anchnic vasoconstri ctor f or the treatm ent of HRS T ype 1 and is 
thestandard of care for this condit ion wherever the drug is available 
(European Association 
for the S tudy of the Liver 2010 ). Although there has been so me o ff-label use of other 
vasoconstri ctors, a recent study  has shown that the most commo nly used agents 
(ie,combinat ion of midodrine and octreoti de) are not effect ive (Cavallin et al, 2015).
5.2 Terlipressin
Terlipressin is a synt hetic vasopressin analogue that acts as a systemic vasoconstrictor via 
thevascular vasopressin V 1receptors. In HRS patients the strong V 1receptor -mediated 
vasoconstri ctor activit y of terlipressin, particularly in the splanchnic area, increases effective 
intravascular vol ume and mean arterial pressure (MAP), ameliorates renin -angiotensin -
aldosterone system  and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivit y, and improves renal blood 
flow. These corrective hemodynamic effe cts culminate in improved renal funct ion, thereby 
provi ding the pharmacologic rationale for treatment of HRS with terlipressin 
(Arroy oet
al, 2000; Ginès et al, 2003 ; Kiszka -Kanowi tz et al , 2004 ).
Terlipressin
Protocol MNK19013058
Incorpo rating Amendments 1, 2 and 3
Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 37of 108 Confidential and ProprietaryAfter intravenous ( IV)administration of terlipressin, the glycyl residues of terlipressin 
arecleaved by  endogenous tissue proteases. Thus, terlipressin levels in the blood decrease 
rather rapidly and the pharmacologically act ive metabolite lysine -vasopressin is released 
gradually  from tissues into the ci rculati on.
Terlipressin is approved in many countries and regio ns outside the US where it has been 
thestandard of care for decades in the treatm ent of subjects with liver cirrhosis and 
esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH) ( de Franchis , 2005; Ioannou et al, 2003), and has 
more recent ly beco me a standard of care for the tr eatment of subjects with HRS T ype 1 where 
it is available 
(EASL , 2010). Terlipressin has been approved for the treatment of HRS T ype 1 
in Australia, France, Ireland, South Korea, Mexico, T aiwan, Spain, India, Brazil, Turkey ,and 
Portugal. 
Refer to the
 Invest igator ’s Brochure for a summary  of the nonclinical studies with terlipressin.
5.3 Clinical S tudies of Terlipressin in Subjects With HRS T ype 1
Clinical data are a vailable fro m 2 rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies, 
(OT-0401 and REVERSE), a randomized, open- label, active -controlled study  (TAHRS), and 
alarge body of published lit erature studi es in over 800 terlipressin -treated subj ects wi th 
HRS Type1 (Invest igator ’s Brochure ).
5.3.1 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
Following a 1 -mg IV dose of terlipressin every 6 hours (q6h) in subjects with HRS Type 1 
(OT-0401 and REVERSE studies), terlipressin has a median terminal half- life o f 
approximately  0.9 hours. Although the half -life o f lysine- vasopressin is short (1 to 6 minutes), 
as a result of the slow metabo lic conversio n of terlipressin to lysine -vasopressin the median 
apparent half -life o f lysine -vasopres sin is increased to approximately  3 hours. 
Small transient changes in blood pressure and heart rate occurred 5 minutes after treatment 
with terlipressin and were likely attributable to the effect of terlipressin; maintaining these 
effects for 6 hours afte r treatm ent was most likely  primarily attributable to the format ion 
oflysine -vasopressin.

Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 38of 108 Confidential and Proprietary5.3.2 Efficacy
Improvem ent in renal funct ion is the goal of thera py for HRS T ype 1; improvement in renal 
funct ion is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes and improved prognosis, with or 
without liver transplantation. HRS reversal is a widely accepted, clinically meaningful 
response to treatment for HRS T ype 1, as apparent inexorable, rapid progression o f renal 
failure i s arrested and normal renal function in the setting of deco mpensated liver disease 
isrestored. The primary  endpoint of HRS reversal (1serum creat inine [ SCr]value of no m ore 
than1.5mg/dL) i s the standard endpo int utilized in the literature and HRS treatment 
guidelines ( Arroy oet al, 1996 ;Salerno et al, 2007; Angeli et al, 2015).
The OT -0401 study  (112 subjects with HRS T ype 1 randomized 1:1 to receive terlipressin 
orplacebo, with concomitant albumin administration recommended in both treatment arms) 
demonstrated a si gnificantly higher rate of HRS reversal (34% vs 13%, p =
0.008) in the 
terlipressin treatment group compared to the placebo group. The primary endpo int of 
Treatment Success at Day 14 (an init ial reduct ion of SCr to no more than 1.5 m g/dL followed 
by a confirmatory  SCr m easurement of no m ore than 1.5 m g/dL 48 hours after the init ial HRS 
reversal and an addit ional SCr value less than 2.5 mg/dL  at Day  14, wi thout intervening liver 
transpl ant or di alysis) was also met fo llowing the incorporati on of  addi tional SCr values post 
initial database closure (29% vs 13%, p = 0.037). Furthermore, the prespecified endpo int of 
change in SCr fro m baseline to Day  14 dem onstrated a greater reduction in SCr with 
terlipressin vs placebo ( -0.9mg/dL; p = 0.0008).
In the REVERSE study  (196 subjects with HRS T ype 1 randomized 1:1 to receiv e terlipressin 
or placebo, wi th concomitant albumin administration recommended in both treatment arms), 
there was a trend for greater HRS reversals with terlipressin treatment vsplacebo 
(24% vs15%, p =0.129) . For a number of reasons (for example ,discharge fro m hospi tal 
before confirmatory  laboratory values ),statistical significance (20% vs 13%, not significant)
was not achieved forconfirmed HRS reversal (an ini tial reduct ion of SCr to no m ore than
1.5mg/dL  followed by a confirmatory  SCr m easurem ent o f no m ore than 1.5 m g/dL 48 hours 
after the ini tial HRS reversal [in the case of hospit al discharge or transplantation before 
48 hours, the 2 confirmatory  SCr val ues had to be at l east 22 hours apart]). Although the 
REVERSE study  did not m eet the prespecif ied endpoint of HRS reversal , the prespecified 
endpo int ofchange in SCr from baseline to end of treatment demonstrated a greater reduction 
in SCr wi th terlipressin vs placebo ( -0.6 mg/dL; p = 0.0002). This current study  has been 
designed to address the me thodological obstacl es encountered in the REVERSE trial.
Terlipressin
Protocol MNK19013058
Incorpo rating Amendments 1, 2 and 3
Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 39of 108 Confidential and ProprietaryThe open -label, active -controlled study  (TAHRS) and a large body of published literature 
studi es (including 44 published clinical invest igations in over 800 terlipressin- treated subjects 
with HRS T ype 1) have consistent ly demo nstrated that terlipressin significant ly improves 
renal funct ion in subjects with HRS Type 1. In T AHRS, the incidence of HRS reversal
wassignificant ly higher in terlipressin + albumin -treated subj ects com pared wi th 
albumin -treated subjects (39.1% vs 8.7%; p = 0.018) and the change in SCr from baseline 
tothe end of treatm ent was -0.7 mg/dL  (p=0.031). Data from the literature studies 
consistent ly showed clinically  relevant improvements in renal funct ion, as m easured 
byreducti on of  SCr (eg, reversal  of HRS or overall  change in SCr), in 20% to 83% of subjects 
studi ed. Furtherm ore, the li terature has been analyzed in a systemat ic fashion by external 
authors in 11 meta -analyses (7 of these meta -analyses included published data from the 
OT-0401 and T AHRS studies), which also confirm the efficacy of terlipressin for the 
treatm ent of HRS.
Refer to the Invest igator ’s Brochure for further details.
5.3.3 Safety
Most subjects in both treatment group s in the OT -0401 and REVERSE studies experienced 
atleast 1 adverse event (AE), which is expected given the high incidence of disease -related 
events in this severely ill pat ient populat ion. The most commo nly observed adverse reactions 
in terlipressin -treated subjects were abdominal pain and diarrhea (refer to T able of Adverse 
Drug Reactions in the Invest igator ’s Brochure ). Less commo n adverse reactions wit h clinical 
significance that were reported in terlipres sin-treated subjects include: wheezing, respiratory  
failure, peripheral ischemia manifested as skin necrosis, peripheral co ldness, livedo reticularis 
and Raynaud’ s pheno menon; intest inal ischemia including ischemic co litis; myocardial 
ischemia including my ocardial infarct ion. The safety  characterist ics of terlipressin in the 
2studi es were consistent with its vasoconstrictor mechanism o f action. None of the events 
leading to discontinuation of terlipressin in eit her study  were fatal  and all resolved afterwa rds. 
Refer to the Invest igator ’s Brochure for further details.
The safet y characteristics of terlipressin observed in the 3randomized, controlled trials 
isconsistent wi th the established safet y profile of t erlipressin fro m 30 years of clinical 
experience, as captured in the literature and post -marketing data from the World Heal th 
Organizat ion (WHO )database. There were no new , unusual or unexpected AEs observed 
inthe clinical studi es co mpared to the publish ed data.

Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 40of 108 Confidential and ProprietaryFor detailed terlipressin safet y risk profiling, please refer to the Invest igator ’s Brochure .
In general, terlipressin has a well- established safety pro file in the treatment of pat ients with 
HRS T ype1. The safet y risks are predictable and recognizable. The adverse drug reactions 
can be readily managed and reversed by terlipressin dose reduction or interruption in 
hospi tal-care settings.
5.4 Study Rationale
The purpose of this rando mized, placebo -controll ed study  is to confirm the efficacy and safety 
of terlipressin in the treatment of subjects with HRS T ype 1 to provi de data to support 
regul atory  approval  of the New Drug Application ( NDA ). Efficacy will be assessed through 
the primary  endpoint of verified HRS reversal ; other important efficacy parameters will be 
assessed including short -term durabilit y of verified HRS reversal, magnitude of SCr lowering 
effect and effects in important subgroups (eg, systemic inflammatory  response syndrome 
[SIRS] subgroup). Safet y data will be collected and incorporated into the overall safet y 
assessment of terlipressin. Methodol ogical obstacles encountered in the REVERSE trial that 
reduced i ts abilit y to show stati stical significance on the primary  endpoint have been 
addres sed in this trial design.
5.4.1 Primary Endpoint Rationale
HRS reversal ,defined as at l east 1 SCr m easurement of no m ore than 1.5mg/dL, has been 
used for decades to determine treatment response in published HRS clinical studies and is 
thestandard endpoint uti lized in the literature and in HRS treatment guidelines ( Arro yoet al,
1996; Salerno et al, 2007; Angeli et al, 2015). The reversal of HRS Type 1 represents 
adramatic clinical response to treatment: for the endpo int to be achieved, the rapid 
progression of renal failure must be arrested and normal renal funct ion restored. The purpose 
of the primary  end point of “verified” HRS reversal is to verify that the first SCr value of no 
more than 1.5 m g/dL is not a spurious laboratory value
.An addit ional element of the primary 
endpo int requi rement ,ie,alive wit hout RRT,has been added to demonstrate the short term 
durabilit y ofthe primary end poin t on clinical outcomes. RRT is defined as any procedure to 
replace non -endocrine ki dney funct ion and includes intermittent hemodialysis, ultrafiltration, 
continuous hemo filtrat ion and hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and other dialysis and 
filtrat ion tech niques.

Administration
The dosing regimen for the current study  (see Secti on10.3) will be the same as that used in 
OT-0401 and REVERSE. In OT -0401 and REVERSE, over 70% of subjects had no dose 
increase from the starting dose of 1 mg q6h and the majorit y of subjects who achieved HRS 
reversal responded at the 1 mg dose of terlipressin. Similarly , in the T AHRS study , 
themajorit y of subjects who achieved HRS reversa lresponded at the 1 mg every  4 hours 
(q4h) dose of terlipressin and all subjects who received a starting dose of 0.5 mg (q4h)
(3mg/day) had a dose increase to at least 1 mg q4h (6 mg/day). No clear dose response 
wasevident from an examinat ion of the lit erature, wi th doses of terlipressin in 44 published 
studi es in HRS Type 1 ranging from 1 to 12 mg/day . Most studi es all owed f or dose increases 
after several days if no significant SCr decrease from baseline was observed. 
As per standard medical pract ice, concomitant use of albumin in both treatment arms 
isstrongly  recommended, if clinically appropriate 
(Arroy oet al, 1996; Salerno et al, 2007;
Angeli et al,
2015).
6Objective
The obj ective o f this study  is to confirm the efficacy and safet y of intravenous terlipressin vs
placebo in the treatm ent of adult subjects with HRS T ype 1 receiving standard of care 
albumin therapy .
6.1 Efficacy V ariables
The efficacy variables are summarized below and further details are provided in Section13.6.
6.1.1 Primary Efficacy V ariables
The primary  efficacy evaluat ion will be based on the fo llowing:

7Investigational Plan
7.1 Overall S tudy Design and Plan: Description
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, mult icenter study  
ofintravenous terlipressin administered to subjects with HRS Type 1 . All subjects
who consent to study  parti cipat ion must undergo an in -hospi tal screening/qualificat ion peri od 
of no less than 48 hours prior to enrollment in order to establish the diagnosi s of HRS Type 1 . 
Written inform ed consent will be obtained by  the investi gator ,sub-invest igator , or qualified 
designee from the subject or legally- authori zed representative pri or to the subject qualification 
form being com pleted. Qualified subjects will then be rando mized in a 2:1 rati o to receive 

Terlipressin

Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 45of 108 Confidential and Proprietaryeitherterlipressin or placebo, stratified by  qualifying SCr ( less than 3.4 mg/dL  or at 
least 3.4mg/dL) andpre-enrollment large vo lume paracentesis ( LVP; at least one single event 
of at least4 L or less than 4 Lwithin 14 days pri or to randomizat ion). The qualifying SCr will 
be the last SCr that was on the screening/qualificatio n eCRF . Atotal of 
300 s ubjects are 
planned to be enro lled at approximately 70sites in the USand Canada.
Subjects will r eceive up to 14 day s of study  treatment IVevery 6 hours (± 30 min utes) 
(maximum o f 15 day s allowed if HRS reversa l is first achieved on Day
14). Subjects will be 
contacted on Day s30 (± 10), 60 (± 14), and 90 (± 14) for assessment of survival, RRT, TIPS, 
and liver transplant status (Figure 1).
Subjects will part icipate in 4assessment period s, which include sscreening, pre -treatm ent, 
active, and fo llow
-up assessment (see Section 13.2).

8Study Population
8.1 Population Rationale
The study  popul ation consists of adult subjects with cirrhosis, ascites, and a diagnosis of HRS 
Type 1 based on the IA C diagnostic cri teria(Arroyo et al, 1996; Salerno et al, 2007;
Angeli etal, 2015).
Terlipressin
Protocol MNK19013058
Incorpo rating Amendments 1, 2 and 3
Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 46of 108 Confidential and ProprietarySubjects with a baseline SCr level greater than 7.0 m g/dL will be excluded from  the study .
The thresho ld for upper cut -off of SCr in entry  criteria is derived fro m the resul ts of previ ous 
NDA  studi es. In OT -0401, none of the subject swith a baseline SCr l evel greater than
7.0mg/dL achieved HRS reversal. Subjects will be stratified by qualifying SCr ( less than
3.4mg/dL  or at least3.4mg/dL).
Qualifying SCr is a prognostic factor for survival and HRS reversal. Excluding subjects with 
abaseline SCr of greater than 7mg/dL  and L VP at least 4 L within 2 days pri or to 
rando mizat ion (both areexclusion criteria for this study), 3.4 mg/dL  (N= 253) was the 
median baseline SCr of subjects enro lled in the OT -0401 and REVERSE studies co mbined.
Subjects will also be stratified by pre-enrollment LVP (at least one singl e event of at least4 L 
orless than 4 Lwithin 3 to 14days prior to randomizat ion).Note, subjects with a L VP o f at 
least 4L areexcluded if it occurs within 2 days prior to randomization ( refer to Secti on8.4).
As per the literature, a paracentesis was considered a L VP if at least4L of fluid was 
withdrawn in a given procedure (Choi et al, 2005; Kao et al, 1985; Ginès et al, 1987 ;Pintoet 
al, 1988; Titoetal,1990) . In REVERSE, there were significant ly more placebo subjects who 
had at least 1 L VP (at least4 L in a single pr ocedure) within 14 days prior to enrollment 
(54[54.5%] placebo subjects vs 36 [37.1%] terlipressin subjects, p =0.0143) (prior LVP data 
were not collected in OT -0401). Subjects with a history  of pri
or LVP exhibited an almost 
3-fold greater verified HRS reversal rate wi th placebo com pared to pl acebo -treated subjects 
without a history  of pri
or LVP (18.5% vs 6.7%). The baseline imbalance increased the overall 
placebo response rate, contribut ing to the lower observed treatment effect.
The invest igator must review any paracentesis perform ed in the pre -enrollment period 
andvolume status after paracentesis must be considered carefully ; as per standard of care, 
adequate replacement of fluid remo ved wi th albumin is required.
8.2 Number of Subjects to be Studied
A total of 300 subjects are planned to be enrolled at approximately 70 sites in the US 
andCanada. Discont inued s ubjects will not be replaced.
8.3 Inclusion Criteria

oNote: Refer to Secti on 21 for a nom ogram  intended for use in situat ions when the 
SCrvalue has increased rapidly over a short period of time but has not y et doubled 
within 2 weeks . Thenomogram  may be used to determine wh ether the subject ’s 
SCrvalues are consistent with a trajectory likely to be representative of at least a 
doubling within 2 weeks (SCr values must be docume nted for a minimum o f 4days).
oIn situations where the time elapsed between SCr values is greater th an 2 weeks, 
theinvest igator must contact the Medical Hotline maintained by the sponsor to 
discuss subject eligibilit y. The qualificat ion form, including all available SCr data ,
must be completed by the investigator or qualified designee and forwarded to 
thesponsor for review and approval prior to enrollment . All co mmunicat ions 
between investigators and the sponsor regarding a subject ’s eligibilit y, including 
reasons supporting inclusio n in the study , will be docum ented.
5. No sustained improvement in renal f unction (less than 20% decrease in SCr and SCr at 
least 2.25 mg/dL) at least 48hours after diuret ic wit hdrawal and the beginning o f plasma

oNote: Albumin doses recommended by the IAC are 1 g/kg on the first day  (maximum  
100 g ) and 20 g/day to40 g/day the reafter as clinically  indicated (Salerno et al,
2007; Angeli et al, 2015) .
Note: The qualifying SCr value is the SCr value at least 48 hours after both diuretic 
withdrawal  (if applicable) and the beginning of albumin fluid challenge.
Thequalifying serum creat inine for subjects on prior vasopressors will be taken after 
completion of vasopressor washout. The qualifying SCr value must be at least
2.25 mg/dL  AND at least 80% of the diagnostic (pre -fluid challenge) SCr value.
Nosubjects should be rando mized unless their SCr has been obtained within 8 hours
prior to randomizat ion and start of study  drug .If there is a delay in subject 
rando mizat ion, then the qualifying/baseline SCr value must be redrawn so that the

10.1 Blinding
This study  will be doubl e-blinded using matching 6 -mL placebo glass vials containing 
lyophilized m annitol without the active ingredient terlipressin, and 6 -mL vials with 
lyophilized m annitol as the inert carrier compound containing 1 mg terlipressin acetate. 
Refer to Section 11.1 for details o f the study  drug and placebo.
10.2 Randomization
Subjects will be rando mly assigned centrally using an interactive vo iceand web response 
system  (IXRS) to treatment groups in order to minimize bias based upon subject select ion 
andbaseline c haracteri stics. Subjects will be stratified by  qualifying SCr ( less than 3.4 mg/dL  
or at least3.4mg/dL) and pre -enrollment LVP (at least one single event of at least4 L or less 
than4 Lwithin 3to14 days prior to randomizat ion), and randomized ( 2:1) t o receive eit her 
active terlipressin or matching placebo. Note, subjects with a L VP of at least 4L are excluded 
if it occurs wi thin 2 days pri or to randomizat ion (refer to Secti on8.4)
.
Each invest igational sitewill receive kits of blinded, labeled act ive and placebo vials each 
numbered with unique, rando mized ident ificat ion numbers. The method of unblinding will be 
through the I XRS. The rando mizat ion codes will be generated by  an independent stati stician 
and wi ll not be accessible to blinded personnel (unless required during a medical emergency) 
during the study  period.
10.3 Dosing With S tudy Drug
Each subject will be assigned blinded study  drug . Under no circumstance is it permitted 
totreat a subject with study  drugthat was not specifically  assigned to that subj ect.
10.3.1 Initial Dosing
Blinded terlipressin or placebo will be administered intravenously as a bo lus inject ion over 
2minutes at a dose of 1 mg (1 vial) every 6 hours (± 30 min utes).After study  drug 
administra tion,the line should be flushed with saline.

Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 53of 108 Confidential and Proprietary10.3.2 Dose Modifications
If SCr has decreased, but by  less than 30% from the baseline value on Day  4 after a 
minimum o f 10doses of study  drug , the dose of study  drug will be increased to 2 mg 
every 6hours (± 30 mi nutes) (8 m g/day). 
The dose shoul d not be increased in subjects with coronary  artery  disease or 
inthesetting of circulatory  overl oad, pulm onary edem a, or bronchospasm.
If dosing is interrupted due to an adverse event, study  drug may be re -started, 
atthediscretion of the invest igator , at the same or lower dose as per protocol
(refer toSection 10.3.2.1 ). Study drug will not be restarted if dosing was interrupted 
due to cardiac ischemia or mesenteric ischemia.
If in the invest igator ’s judgment, a dose increase is not advisable or otherwise just ified 
in the individual subject, the reason(s) for not increasing the dose of study  drug will be 
docum ented on the el ectroni c case report form (eCRF).
10.3.2.1 Management of Advers e Events
With the exception o f presum ed cardiac or intestinal ischemia, the init ial management of AEs 
may include dose reduction or temporary  interruption of study  drug dosing. After dose 
interrupti on, study  drug m ay be restarted at a reduced dose of 0.5 m g or 1 m g every  6 to 
12hours . At the discret ion of the invest igator, thedose m ay then be increased to the previous 
dose l evel. Careful assessment of concomitant medicat ions and treatment (particularly 
albumin dosing) and their potential relat ionship to t he AE should be undertaken and adjusted 
as per standard of care and invest igator discret ion. If possible, study  drug dosing shoul d be 
restarted prompt ly and/or m aintained at usual or reduced dosing particularly for the first 
4days of study  drug administra tion.Invest igators are encouraged to discuss any dosing 
questions with the Medical Hotline .
10.3.2.1.1 Management of Fluid Overload
Volume overload in this context refers to intravascular vo lume overload manifested 
aspulmo nary congest ion or overt pulmonary  edema. S ubjects with increasing dyspnea, cough, 
orthopnea, or tachy pnea shoul d be carefully evaluated for evidence of pulmo nary edema 
(physical examinat ion and, as j udged by the investigator to be indicated, chest X -rayor other 
investigat ions). In subjects with f luid overload, especially those with respiratory  events 
Terlipressin
Protocol MNK19013058
Incorpo rating Amendments 1, 2 and 3
Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 54of 108 Confidential and Proprietary(dyspnea, respiratory  distress), careful assessment of concomitant albumin and temporary  
albumin dose reduction or discont inuance may be the most appropriate init ial management. 
Judicious, short term use of tem porary  diureti c therapy  as per standard of care may  be 
undertaken at the discret ion of the investigator in some subjects in whom a response to 
diuretic therapy  is expected. If fluid overload requiring intervent ion persists after these init ial 
measures, further management should include dose reduction or temporary  interruption 
ofstudy  drug dosing as above.
10.4 Treatment Discontinuation
Treatment should be continueduntil 24 hours after 2 consecut iveSCr value sno m ore 
than1.5mg/dL  havebeen obtained, OR up to a m aximum  of 14 day s 
(maximum of15days if SCr first reaches 1.5 mg/dL  on Day 14). 
If on Day  4 (af ter a minimum  of 10 doses) SCr is at or above baseline value, 
study drug shoul d be discont inued.
Treatment must be discont inued when the subject is to undergo RR T, 
liver transpl antati on, TIPS or vasopressor therapy .

10.5 Assessment of Recurrence
Any subject with aSCr value of at least 2.25 m g/dL after achieving verified HRS reversal, but 
prior to transplant/discharge/Day 14, will be assessed for HRS T ype 1 recurrence. HRS 
recurrence by Day 30 is defined as another episode of HRS Type 1, by Day 30, after achieving 
verified HRS reversal, characterized by rapidly  progressive worsening in renal function to a 
SCrat least2.25 mg/dL, without sustained improvement in renal funct ion (less than 20% 
decrease in SCr and SCr at least2.25 m
g/dL) at l east 48 hours after diuretic withdrawal and 
the beginning of pla sma vo lume expansion wit h albumin, and meeting all applicable inclusio n 
and exclusio n criteria (as outlined in Section 8.3and Secti on 8.4)defining the init ial diagn osis 
of HRS T ype 1.

Theinvest igator will determine whether the subject has had a recurrence of HRS T ype 1. 
Ifthe invest igator cannot exclude a recurrence of HRS T ype 1, then the subject will be 
considered to have HRS T ype 1 recurrence. HRS T ype 1 recurrence wi ll be m onitored 
asfollows: Recurrence of HRS Type 1 during the follow -up peri od (after di scharge or Day  14) 
will be assessed based upon the invest igator ’s opini on and seri ous AE data collected up to 
30days after end of treatment. Following the init ial hospital discharge, all re -hospi talizat ions 
within 30 days after end of treatment (except for planned hospital admissions or procedures 
asdescribed in the protocol) are to be recorded as an SAE. Re -hospi talizat ions will require 
aninvest igator assessment an d opinio n regarding possible recurrence of HRS Type 1.
Allavailable relevant medical records, MedW atch forms, di scharge summaries or 
other relevant source documents shoul dbe requested and reviewed for all SAEs, including 
allhospi talizati ons, unt il 30 da ys after discontinuatio n of study  drug .
HRS T ype 1 recurrence beyo nd 30 day s after end of treatment will be further monitored based 
on requests for retreatment as outlined in Section 10.6 of the protocol.
10.6 Retrea tment
If judged by the invest igator to be potentially beneficial, subjects who demonstrate at least 
apartial response during the init ial treatment course ( at least30% reduction in SCr) who 
develop recurrence of HRS T ype 1 during the study or fo llow-up pe riod may  be retreated wi th 
initially assigned blinded study  drug for a m aximum o f 14 days ( from the beginning of the

13.3 Detail of Baseline Assessments and Procedures
13.3.1 Physical Exam ination
A complete physical exam ination,including weight and height, will be conducted at baseline
and at the 30- day follow-up. This will  include a general  physical assessment of the major 
body  systems evaluat ing any new clinically significant abnormalit ies wi thin the foll owing: 
general appeara nce, skin, head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, neck, heart, lungs, abdo men, extremit ies, 
neuro logical, back/spinal , and lymph nodes. This includes worsening o f baseline condit ions.
In addit ion, abbreviated physical examinat ions will be conducted every  day during t he 14 -day 
active study  period.
The invest igator may perform addit ional unscheduled examinat ions to manage or evaluate 
asuspected AE as clinically necessary . The t iming and scope of addit ional unscheduled 
examinat ions should be determined by  the nature and severit y of the AE being evaluated. 
Inthe case of suspected cardiac, intest inal or other ischemia, examinat ion of the subject by  
aphysician should be completed on an emergency basis (generally within 15 to 30 minutes). 
Forsuspected cardiac ischemia, ex aminat ion should include assessment of vital signs, cardiac 
and pulmo nary auscul tation, and evaluat ion of jugul ar venous pressure by clinical 
exam inationand other com ponents as determined by  the physician's clinical judgment. For 
suspected cardiac ischemi a, site must perform  an ECG and cardiac enzymes (high sensit ivity 
troponin) at the time of assessment and 3hours l ater.Subjects with suspected intestinal 
ischemia should undergo careful examinat ion of the abdo men to evaluate for the presence of

13.3.4 Vital Signs
The proposed post -study

and heart rate are based on PK data from the OT -0401 and REVERSE clinical trials. 
The5(±2) min and 2 (±0.25) h time po ints roughly co incide with peak plasma concentrations 
of terlipressin and lysine- vasopressin respect ively . Refer to Section 13.4.1 .
13.3.5 Assessment of Multi -Organ Dysfunction
With the advancement in intensive care medicine, mult iorgan dysf unction syndrome (MODS) 
has repl aced the term  multio rgan failure since the complet ion of the REVERSE study . 
According to Al-Khafaji et al, 2015, MODS describes a continuum wit h incremental degrees 
of physio logic d erangements in individual organs; a process rather than a single event. 
Alteration in organ funct ion can vary widely fro m a mild degree of organ dysfunct ion 
tocompletely irreversible organ failure.
Multi-organ failure or dysfunction ,a hallmark of acute o n chronic liver failure (ACLF), 
commo n in the study  patient popul ation, is defined and quant ified by the original CLIF -SOFA 
score or its simplified versio n Chronic Liver Failure Consortium ( CLIF -
C)Organ Fa ilure 
score ( Arroyo et al, 2015). The scoring system has been developed and validated 
forpredi cting mortalit y in pat ients with 
ACLF (Jalan et al, 2014 ).

Incidence of verified HRS reversal, defined as the percentage of subjects with 2 consecutive 
SCr values no m ore than 1.5 mg/dL at least 2 hours apart, while on treatment by Day 14 or 
discharge (ontreatm ent defined as up to 24 hours after the final dose of study  drug) . Subj ects
must be alive wit hout RR T for at least 10 days after achieving verified HRS reversal. SCr 
values after RR T, TIPS, liver transplant, or open -label vasopressor use will be excluded from 
primary  endpoint analysis. SCr values obtained after midodrine administration will be 
included if midodrine was started on Day  1, was administered for no more than 24 h ours, and 
the subject was enro lled on or after 17 August 2018. SCr values will also be included if 
obtained after the administration of a single dose of dobutamine.
SCr data for the primary end po int will be collected at least daily until discharge or Day 14. 
Theanalysis will bebased on ITT populat ion. Treatment should be cont inued unt il 24 hours

Also included are events that are commo n to thi s subject popul ation.
14.1.1 Adverse Event Definition
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient or clinical invest igation 
subject administered a pharmaceut ical product and which does not necessarily have to have 
acausal relat ionship with this treatm ent.An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable 
andunintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), symptom, 
ordisease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (invest igational) product, 
whether or not considered relate d to the medicinal (invest igational) product.
14.1.2 Adverse Reaction Definition
An adverse react ion (AR)is defined as any AE caused by a drug.
In the preapproval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) m ay not be established, all noxious and unintended 
responses to a medicinal product related to any  dose shoul d be considered adverse drug

between a m edicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibilit y, 
ie,therelationship cannot be ruled out.
14.1.3 Suspected Adverse Reaction Definition
A suspected adverse react ionis defined as a n AEfor which there is a reasonable possibilit y 
that the drug cau sed the AE. Reasonable possibility suggest sa causal relat ionship between 
thestudy  drug treatm ent and the AE. Asuspected adverse react ion implies a lesser degree 
ofcertaint y about causalit ythan an AE.
14.1.3.1 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction Definition
An unex pected adverse drug reaction is defined as a n adverse react ion, the nature or severit y 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product informat ion (eg, Invest igator's Brochure 
for an unapproved invest igational product or package insert/summary  of product 
characterist ics for an approved product).
14.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse 
Reaction Definition
This is a n AE or suspected unexpected adverse reaction ( SUSAR)which i s not listed in 
theInvest igator ’sBrochure (IB), norlisted at the specificit y or severi ty observed. If an AE 
orSUSAR is listed in the IB as occurring with a specific class of drugs, or occurring as part of 
a disease process ,or from the pharmaco logical properti es of the drug, but not specifically

Serious adverse events (SAE) are a subset of adverse events. They  aredefined (in the view of 
the invest igator or the sponsor) a sany untoward medical occurrence that meets any of the 
following criteria:
Resulted in death .
Is life-threatening (i f an AE or SUS ARplaces a subject at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death 
ifit were m ore severe ).
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prol ongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on.
Results in disabilit y (persistent or significant incapacit y or substant ia l disrupt ion of 
theabilit y to conduct normal life funct ions).
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect .
Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
orrequire ho spitalizati on m ay be considered serio us when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they mayjeopardize the subject and may require medical 
orsurgical intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Examples of an important medic al event include: allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias, convulsio nsthat do not result in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or 
drug dependence/abuse.
14.1.7 Severity of an Adverse Event
Intensit y of an AE ,assessed by the investigator and graded as mild, moderate or severe, 
irrespect ive of the relat ionship to the drug or seriousness of the event , and evaluated according 
to the following scales:
Mild -awareness of the symptom but easily tolerated .
Moderate -disco mfort enough to interfere with normal act ivities.
Sever e -Incapacitat ing with the inabilit y to perf orm normal activi ties.
An AE not listed in the IB at the specificit y or severi ty observed is considered unexpected.

Study  drug causalit y will be assessed as fo llows:
Unrelated: An AE that is clearly  and incontrovertibly  due to extraneous causes 
(disease, environment, etc) and does not meet the criteria for ‘possible’  or ‘probable.’
Possible: The connect ion between the AE and study  treatm ent appears unlikely , but cannot 
beruled out wi th certa inty. An AE may be considered ‘possibly related’  if it has at l east 
2ofthe following:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study  drug.
It may readily have been produced by  the subject's clinical state or by  environmental  
or toxic factors .
It follows a known response pattern to study  drug.
Probable: An AE that is considered to be related to study drug treatm ent with a high degree 
of certaint y. An AE may be considered probably related if:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study  drug.
It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characterist ics of the subject's 
clinical state.
It follows a known pattern of response to study  drug treatm ent.
It reappears upon rechallenge .
Table14–1 lists adverse events that are commo n in this subject populat ion(ie ,with HRS) , 
even in the absence of exposure to the study  drug (Rozov -Ung and Panesar, 2010;
Arroy oet al,
2008) .The invest igator may use this as a guidance while assessing the causalit y.
Adverse events will be analyzed in both an aggregate and individual manner . However, if it is 
deem ed an AR, the sponsor will fo llow the appropria te procedures to communicate and report 
the AR.

14.1.9 Overdose
Overdose is defined as an accidental or intent ional/infusio n or excessi ve dose of a product.
14.2 Collection of Adverse Events/Serious or Unexpected
Any AE occurring prior to signing the ICFshoul d be considered medical history  or a 
pre-exist ing condit ion and will be collected on the Medical History  eCRF. 
All AEs will be assessed and recorded beginning with study  drug administration until 7 days 
after discontinuation of study drug and at each evaluat ion. Adverse events considered serious 
will be assessed and recorded until 30 days after discontinuation o f study  drug , excluding 
deaths, which will be collected up to 90 day s after the first dose of study  drug.
The invest igator will co llect and record all necessary  data including invest igations that were 
perform ed for any  AE of special interest ,ie, an ischemic abdo minal event, ischem ic cardiac

abnorm alities deemed clinically  significant will be recorded as AEs (as defined abov e) on 
theeCRF . Those events considered serious should be reported to the sponsor as outlined 
inSecti on14.3.1 .
14.2.2 Hospitalizations
Planned hospi tal admissio ns and/or planned surgical operations for an illn ess or disease, 
which existed before the subject was rando mized are not to be considered AEs
(eg,re-hospi talizat ion for liver transplantation). However, a baseline condit ion which 
deteri orate sduring the clinical study may be considered an AE.
Following t he initial hospi tal discharge, all re -hospi talizati ons wi thin 30 days post end 
oftreatm ent (except for pl anned hospi tal admissio ns or procedures as described above) are 
tobe recorded as aserious AE . Re-hospi talizat ions will require an invest igator asses sment 
andopini on regarding possible recurrence of HRS Type 1.
14.2.3 Complications of the Disease
Com plicat ions frequent ly associated with HRS Type 1 are expected to occur, but should be 
recorded as an AE or serious AE,as applicable, eg, EVH , hepatic encephalopathy , sepsis, 
pneumo nia, urinary  tract infect ion. 
Since HRS Type 1 is the indicat ion under invest igation ,worsening or aggravation of HRS 
during the active treatment period (including non- response) will NOT be recorded as a serious 
AE unless HRS is the ca use of death or results in a subsequent re -hospitalizat ion due 
tosuspected recurrence.

15Statistical Plan
This is a rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, mult icenter studyof intravenous 
terlipressin in subject s with HRS Type 1. All subject s who consent to study participat ion must 
undergo an in -hospi tal screening/qualificat ion period of no less than 48 hours prior to 
enrollment in order to establish the diagnosis of HRS Type 1. Written inform ed consent will 
be obtained by the invest igator ,sub-invest igator or qualified designee from the subject 
orlegally -authorized representative prior to the subject qualification form being completed . 
Qualified subject s are then rando mized in a 2:1 rati o to receive ei ther terli pressin or pl acebo, 
stratified by qualifying SCr ( less than 3.
4mg/dL  or at least3.4mg/dL)and LVP (at least one 
single event of at least4 L or less than 4 Lwithin 14 days prior to randomization) . A total of 
300subjects are planned to be enrolled at approximately 70sites in the United States and 
Canada .
Randomization will be done centrally using an I XRS stratified by  qualifying SCr (less 
than3.
4mg/dL  or at least 3.4mg/dL) andpre-enrollment LVP (at least one single event of at 
least 4 L orless than 4 Lwithin 3to 14 days prior to randomizat ion).Note, subjects with a 
LVP of at least4L areexcluded if it occurs within 2 days prior to randomization (refer to

NOTE: Based on REVERSE , subjects without a known event of pre -enrollment LVP at least 4 L within 2 days 
of randomization and OT -0401 subjects with baseline SCr no more than 7 mg/dL. SCr values were included 
while the subjects were on treatment, up to 24hours after the final dose of study drug. SCr values were excluded 
after RRT and transplant. If a subject died within 10 days after the reversal, then the subject did not have a 
reversal. If a subject has an RRT by the 30 -day follow -up visit, then the subject did not have a reversal. Three 
REVERSE terlipressin subjects who achieved a reversal after the 24 hour window were counted as reversals 
because they would have continued on study drug base d on the CONFIRM trial design through the reversal.
With a 2:1 randomization of terlipressin to placebo and an interim analysis after 50% of the 
subjects have completed Day  14 or Di scharge, 300subjects will provide 89.76 % power to 
detect a statist ically significant difference between the groups, 200 subjects in the terlipressin 
group and 100subjects in the placebo group.
15.3.2 Interim Analysis
An interim analysis will be performed after 50% of the subjects have completed Day  14 or 
discharge, 150subjects with approximately  100 in the terlipressin group and 50in the 
placebo group. An O’Brien -Fleming spending function is used for the interim analysis alpha 
spending. For the interim analysis, the methods described in Section15.3.6.1 will be followed.
15.3.3 Subject Populations
The populat ions that will be utilized for this study are defined below .
15.3.3.1 Intention to T reat Population
The intention to treat (ITT)population is defined as all rando mized subject s. Treatm ent 
classificat ion will be based on the randomized treatment . The ITT population defined in this

15.3.6 Efficacy Analyses
All efficacy endpo ints will be analyzed primarily in the ITT populat ion. Data from the init ial 
treatm ent course will be utilized in the analyses . Any retreatment courses will be evaluated 
separately .
15.3.6.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis
Incidence of v erified HRS reversal isdefined as the percentage of subjects with 2consecut ive 
SCr values no m ore than 1.5 m g/dL at least 2 hours apart, while on treatment by Day 14 or 
discharge (ontreatm ent defined as up to 24 hours after the final dose of study  drug) . The 
subject m ust be alive wit hout RR T for at least 10 days after achieving verified HRS reversal. 
SCr values after RR T, TIPS, liver transplant, or open -label vasopressor use will be excluded 
from primary  end point analysis. SCr values obtained after mido drine administration will be 
included if midodrine was started on Day 1, was administered for no more than 24 hours, and 
the subject was enro lled on or after 17 August 2018. SCr values will also be included if 
obtained after the administration of a single dose of dobutamine.
Verified HRS reversal will be summarized by  treatment group and analyzed using a Z Score 
based on the upper alpha boundary  values for the interim and final analyses. The upper alpha 
boundary  value f or the interim analysis is 2.79651. Atthe interim analysis, if the Z score

Theinvest igator is required to maintain an accurate and complete record of all written 
correspondence to and received from the IRB and must agree to share all such documents 
andreports wi th the sponsor .
18.1.1 Protocol Amendments
Any change in the study  plan requi res a protocol  amendment. An invest igator must not make 
any chan ges to the study  without IRB and sponsor approval except when necessary  
Terlipressin

Mallinckrodt Pharm aceuticals Page 100of 108 Confident ial and Propri etarytoeliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. A protocol  change intended to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately , but 
thechange must then be documented in an amendment, reported to the IRB within 5 working 
days, and submitted to the appropriate regulatory  agency in the required t ime frame.
18.2 Informed Consent
Written inform ed consent will be obtained from all subject s (or thei r guard ian or legal 
representative) before any study -related procedures (including any pre -treatm ent 
study -specific procedures) are performed . The investigator(s) has both ethical and legal 
responsibilit y to ensure that each subject being considered for inclusio nin this study is given 
afull explanat ion of the protocol . This shall be documented on a written informed consent 
form, which shall be approved by  the same IRB responsible for approval of this protocol . 
Each informed consent form shall include the element s requi red by regul atory regul ations 
in21 Code of Federal Regulat ions (CFR) Part 50 and ICH Guidance E6, Section 4.8. 
Theinvest igator agrees to obtain approval fro m the sponsor of any written informed consent 
form used in the study , preferably prior to s ubmission to the IRB.
Once the appropriate essent ial information has been provided to the subject and 
fully explained by  the invest igators (or a qualified designee) and it is felt that the subject
understands the implicat ions of participating, the subject and the invest igator (o r designee) 
shall sign the IRB -approved written informed consent form . The subject shall be given a copy 
of the si gned informed consent form, and the original shall be kept in the site’ s regulatory  file. 
A second copy  may be filed in the subject 's medical record, if allowed by the inst itution.
18.3 Confidentiality
All information generated in this study will be consi dered confident ial and will  not be 
disclosed to any  persons not di rectly concerned with the study without wri tten pri or 
permi ssion from the sponsor . However, authorized regulatory o fficials and sponsor personnel 
will be allowed full access to the records . All medications provided and subject bodily fluids 
and/or other materials co llected shall be used so lely in accordance wi th this protocol, 
unless otherwise agreed to in writ ing by the sponsor .
Only init ials and/orunique subject numbers in case report forms will ident ify subject s. 
Their full names may , however, be made known to a product regulatory  agency  or other 
authori zed off icial if necessary.

Mallinckrodt Pharm aceuticals Page 101of 108 Confident ial and Propri etary18.4 Biological Samples
Blood sam ples will be used only for scient ific research. Each sample will be labeled with a 
code so that the laboratory  personnel testing the samples will not know the subject’ s identity. 
After the study  ends, the cli nical  laboratory  samples will be destroy ed. Bi oanaly tical samples 
(ie,plasma, who le blood, uri ne) for measurement of drug/metabolite content will be retained 
at a bi ological storage facilit y. The subject may request that his or her samples, if st ill 
ident ifiable, be destroy ed at any  time; however, any data already co llected fro m that sam ple 
will st ill be used for this research.
18.5 Subject Injury
In general, subject to specific provisio ns in the clinical trial agreement, if a subject is injured 
as a di rect res ult of an invest igational medicinal product, the sponsor will pay for reasonable 
and necessary medical treatment for the injury , to the extent that such expenses are not 
covered by  the subject’ s medical  insurance, a government program, or other responsible third 
party . If laws or regul ations of the l ocali ty in which the study  is taking pl ace requi re addi tional 
payment of expenses, the sponsor shall co mply with such laws or regul ations. 
Where applicable, the sponsor has taken specific national insurance.
18.6 Study Suspension, T ermination, and Completion
The sponsor or designee may suspend or terminate the study  or part of the study  at any  time 
for any  reason. 
If the invest igator suspends or terminates the study , the invest igator will pro mptly inform  
thesponsor or designee and the IRB and provide them with a detailed written explanat ion. 
The invest igator will destroy all unused (after final drug accountabilit y has been performed) 
and partially used invest igational product per site standard operating procedure . Upon study  
completion, the invest igator will provide the sponsor or designee, IRB, and regulatory agency 
with final reports and summaries as required by regulat ions. For IND applicat ion studies, 
orwhen the data will be used in support of an IND, the invest igator m ust submit a wri tten 
report to the sponsor or designee and the IRB within 3 m onths after the com pletion 
orterminat ion of the study . Study  terminat ion and fo llow-up will be performed in co mpliance 
with applicable standard operating procedures.

Criterion for SC RDoubling Over a 2-WeekPeriod
The no mogram  is intended for use in situations when the SCr value has increased rapidly 
over a shorter period of time but has not y et doubled wi thin 2 weeks.
To fulfill inclusio n criterion 
#4, subjects m ust ha ve a rapidly progressive worsening in renal 
funct ion to a SCr at least2.25 mg/dL  (meeting a trajectory for SCr to double over 2weeks).
Thequalifying serum creat inine for subjects on 
prior vasopressors will be taken after 
completion of vasopressor washout.
For ease of calculat ion, these trajectories are est imated by  relating a certain required “fo ld 
increase in SCr” to the elapsed time in days between 2measured values (see Figure 3
andTable21–1); greater proportional increases in SCr are required for observat ions of shorter 
durati on. As noted in the no mogram , a 1.5 -fold increase between the SCr values must be 
achieved within 4 days o f observation . The requi red fold increa se in SCr between SCr values 
progressively rises fro m 4 days of observat ion up to a 2 fold increase by  14 days observati on.

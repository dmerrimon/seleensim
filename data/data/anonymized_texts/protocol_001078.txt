 5 Introduction  
 
Background and Rationale   
 
Compared with other risk factors, elevated BP is associated with more CVD events and BP is associated with more CVD events and disability-adjusted life years lost in the US and 
worldwide. To identify patients with hypertension and monitor their BP while taking 
antihypertensive medication, most US guidelines and scientific statements recommend BP be 
measured in the clinic setting by a trained healthcare professional. This recommendation is supported by extensive data, demonstrating that elevated BP, measured using this approach, is associated with increased risk for CVD and renal disease events. In clinical practice and 
research studies conducted in the US, BP is almost universally measured in the clinic with an 
observer present (attended clinic BP).  Several studies have found that compared with attended clinic BP, BP measured outside of the clinic is a better predictor of a person’s CVD risk. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend that 
elevated BP measured in the clinic be confirmed by out-of-clinic BP measurements prior to 
diagnosing hypertension. ABPM is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP assessment and making the diagnosis of hypertension. ABPM monitors are compact, worn on a belt or in a pouch, and connected to a BP cuff on the upper arm by a tube. The monitors are programmed 
to obtain readings using the oscillometric method, every 15 to 30 minutes, typically for 24 hours, 
throughout the day and night.  
 
In some people, there is a transient BP increase that occurs in the clinic setting (i.e., white coat effect). For others, BP is lower in the clinic when compared to measurements obtained outside of the clinic environment (i.e., masked effect). White coat hypertension is defined as 
hypertension based on clinic -ma≥ 140 mm Hg the cli nic setting (awake BP < 135/85 mm Hg). In 
most ABPM studies, white coat hypertension has not been associated with increased CVD risk. 
In contrast, masked hypertension, defined as not having hypertension based on BP measured in the clinic setting (< 140/90 mm Hg) but hypertension based on out-of-clinic measurements (awake BP ≥ 155 mm Hg) is associated with a markedly increased CVD risk. Among adults with SBP/DBP ≥ 140 mm Hg white coat hypertension. Additionally, between 15% and 30% of adults 
with SBP/DBP < 1 40/90 mm Hg, defined using attended BP measured in the clinic, have 
masked hypertension.  
 
There is a diurnal pattern of BP, which normally falls to its lowest level during sleep. Nocturnal hypertension, defined by having high mean sleep BP (SBP/DBP ≥ 120/70 mm Hg) with an 
increased risk for CVD events, independent of BP measured in the clinic and awake BP on 
ABPM. Assessing sleep BP may be particularly important for African Americans, a population with high CVD risk and approximately two times higher prevalence of nocturnal hypertension compared with whites. In the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a cohort comprised exclusively of  
African Americans, 60% of participants had nocturnal hypertension and the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for CVD events was 1.84 ( 95% CI: 1.00, 3.38) comparing participants with 
and without nocturnal hypertension. Also, a high percentage of African Americans with nocturnal hypertension do not have hypertension based on clinic BP or awake BP on ABPM.  
 
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 6 Until recently, ABPM has been the only method that could assess sleep BP. The misdiagnosis 
of hypertension when BP is measured by an observer in the clinic versus by ABPM is well 
recognized by guidelines, scientific statements, and position papers. However, there are several 
challenges that have prevented the wide-spread use of ABPM in clinical practice. Recently, we conducted a nominal groups study, a qualitative research approach, with 40 physicians in Alabama and New York to identify barriers to performing ABPM. Reported barriers included need for staff training, time constraints in patient preparation, and lack of infrastructure and inaccessibility of equipment and specialists to whom providers could refer their patients for the 
ABPM procedure. Also, ABPM devices cost over $2,000 each, insurance companies do not 
commonly reimburse for indications other than white coat hypertension, and when reimbursed, the compensation is low.  Low patient tolerability for ABPM has been reported in previous studies. For example, in one 
study, side effects associated with ABPM ranged from 7% for bruising to 70% for the device 
awakening the participant during sleep. Given the real world limitations of ABPM, novel approaches are needed for measuring awake and sleep BP. An emerging method that has been propos ed for estimating awake BP is to measure BP in the clinic using a fully automated 
oscillometric device (AOBP) without an observer being present (unattended clinic BP 
measurement). There are currently two validated oscillometric devices available in the US 
(Omron HEM-907XL and Microlife’s Watch BP office) that can be programmed to measure BP automatically without an observer being present. Using these devices, the technician or healthcare provider leaves the room after a person has a BP cuff placed on their arm and they are positioned for measurements. After a minute rest, the device inflates the cuff and BP is measured. AOBP devices can obtain several BP measurements at preset (e.g., one minute) 
intervals. The maker of BPTru, a third device, went out of busi ness in 2017. 
 
Canadian studies suggest that patients with hypertension have lower unattended BP compared with attended BP. Therefore, the use of unattended clinic BP may result in a lower prevalence of white coat hypertension. In a pooled analysis of 8558 adults, the mean clinic BP was 10/7 mm 
Hg lower with unattended AOBP versus BP recorded by a provider in clinical practice by auscultation and a mercury sphygmometer. In the only randomized study of AOBP published to date, the difference between BP when measured observed and unobserved was small (< 5 mm Hg). In 2017, the Hypertension Canada guideline recommended unattended BP (i.e., AOBP) as the preferred method of clinic BP measurement.10 However, this recommendation was based on a Grade D level of evidence (i.e. quality of evidence is very low, based on expert opinion, no 
direct research evidence, and studies had very severe limitations). US guidelines do not 
currently recommend AOBP for use in clinic practice. Recently, in a post -hoc analysis of 
SPRINT d ata, there was no difference in clinic BP between sites that measured it unattended 
versus attended (manuscript under review at Hypertension, personal communication, S. Oparil). At each visit, SPRINT participants did not have both unattended and attended B P 
measurements; there was no randomization; information about the conduct of unattended or attended BP measurements was obtained retrospectively after study end; and no comparison to ABPM was made. There is currently equipoise as to whether unattended clinic BP provides an accurate estimate of awake BP on ABPM.  
 Two issues have been raised as barriers to implementing AOBP in clinical practice: the time it 
takes to perform this procedure and the need for dedicated space. Although AOBP takes longer 
than unstandardized clinic BP measurement (clinic BP taken without following guideline-recommended approaches), AOBP takes a shorter amount of time than clinic BP measurements taken following American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations. Further, 
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 7 unstandardized clinic BP measurements are very common in clinical practice, generate poor 
estimates of BP, and interventions targeted at observers to obtain standardized clinic BP have 
been largely unsuccessful. Having a dedicated room to perform unattended BP has been 
reported as a barrier to AOBP. However, if clinic space is not available, unattended AOBP can be successfully performed while a patient is in a waiting room.  
 Recently, home BP monitors (HBPM) have been adapted to measure asleep BP. As described below, there are compelling preliminary data supporting this approach. Until recently, sleep BP 
could only be assessed by ABPM. HBPM devices have been developed that measure BP 
automatically during sleep. These devices have been previously validated for accuracy. Before going to sleep, a person attaches a BP cuff to their arm and turns on the HBPM device, which is programmed to take BP measurements while the person is asleep. In a prior study conducted in Japan, an HBPM device (Omron HEM -5001) was programmed to obtain BP measurements at 
2am, 3am and 4am. Given that only three readings are obtained during the sleep period and that a prior study demonstrated the feasibility for measuring sleep BP, there is great potential for using these HBPM devices for accurately measuring sleep BP with less burden than ABPM. Table 3 shows the major limitations of published studies using HBPM to assess sleep BP. In the current study, we will test whether HBPM is an accurate and better tolerated approach for 
measuring sleep BP than ABPM.  
 
 
Objectives  
 Primary Aim 1:  To examine whether measuring unattended clinic BP with an automated device 
will provide a more accurate estimate of awake BP on ABPM than measuring attended clinic BP 
with an automated device. Hypothesis 1a: The absolute difference with awake BP will be 
smaller for unattended vs. attended clinic BP. Hypothesis 1b: The agreement between 
hypertension status using BP measured in the clinic and on ABPM while awake will be higher when clinic BP is measured unattended vs. attended. Also, the prevalence of both white coat and masked hypertension will be lower when measuring unattended clinic BP. 
 
Primary Aim 2:  To examine whether a new HBPM device provides an accurate approach for 
measuring sleep BP. Hypothesis 2a: Sleep BP on HBPM will provide an accurate estimate of sleep BP on ABPM. Hypothesis 2b: HBPM will be better tolerated (e.g., less awakening during sleep, pain, bruising) than ABPM.  
 
Primary Aim 3:  To compare the associations of unattended versus attending clinic BP, 
unattended clinic BP versus awake BP on ABPM, and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with 
two markers of end-organ damage, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and urinary albumin-to-
creatinine ratio (ACR). Hypothesis 3a: The association with end-organ damage will be stronger for unattended vs. attended clinic BP. Hypothesis 3b: The association with end-organ damage 
will be similar for unattended clinic BP and awake BP. Hypothesis 3c: The association with end-
organ damage will be similar for sleep BP by HBPM and ABPM.

 14 Summary  
 
During the screening process, participants will complete an initial telephone screening to 
determine their preliminary eligibility. If eligible, they will be asked to complete a blood pressure 
screening in the clinic to determine if they are eligible to continue in the study.   There is a consent addendum that was prepared for the Better BP  study.  Participants will be 
consented immediately prior to initiation of this study.  
 
Below are the steps to follow for participants who are eligible and consent for the Better BP 
study . 
 
1. Participants will be randomized to have their clinic blood pressure measured unattended 
or attended first using a Microlife WatchBP Office AFIB device.  Blood pressure will be 
measured three times  in the non-dominant arm following a standard protocol. They will 
then have their blood pressure measured three times again using the opposite method 
(i.e. if attended first, then unattended second).  
 
2. The following questionnaires will be administered to participants:  
a. Sociodemographic/Medical History 
b. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  (PSQI) 
 
Whenever possible, these questionnaires will be self-administered.  Research coordinators can administer these questions orally for participants who would otherwise 
have difficulty completing questionnaires on their own. 
3. Measure height, weight, and waist and neck circumference. Neck circumference is 
needed for the STOP -BANG sleep apnea scale . 
4. Participants will then return to the clinic for the next visit in 24 to 48 hours  and have their 
clinic blood pressure measured three times u nattended and attended in the reverse 
order of visit 1 using the Microlife WatchBP Office AFIB device. 
5. Participants will be randomized to receive either the ABPM or HBPM device at visit 2.  
6. They will be fitted for the device ( WatchBP O3 ABPM or WatchBP  Home N) that they 
were randomized to receive first. 
7. The staff member will explain how the participant should act when a BP measurement is taken.  
8. One measurement will be taken – check to make sure the cuff inflates and deflates  and 
that a valid reading is obtained.  Watch to make sure that the participant positions their 
arm as instructed.  If an error reading is obtained, check that the cuff is properly placed and neither too tight nor too loose, and retake the BP measurement.  If three 
consecutive error readings are obtained, try a different device. 
9. Participants will be given instructions for  placing (Home N) or  replacing (O3 ABPM) the 
device if it has to be removed. 
10. Participants will be given a phone number to call if they have any questions during the 
monitoring period.  
11. Participants will be given the appropriate (ABPM or HBPM)  device log to fill out.  This 
form captures the time a participant goes to sleep and awakens. Additionally, this form can be used to document any time when a participant removes  the device and puts it 
back on.  
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 15 12. The Actiwatch device will be fitted.  
13. The next day, participants will return the device and device log, complete either the post-
ABPM or post-HBPM questionnaire based on what device was worn, and be fitted for 
the opposite device (either O3 ABPM or Home N).  
14. At the last visit, participants will return the device and device log and complete either the 
post-ABPM or post-HBPM questionnaire based on what device was worn. 
15. Participant will complete the comparability questionnaire. 
16. Participants will complete a non-fasting blood draw and spot urine.  
17. Participants will complete an echocardiogram. If the echo lab does not have availability 
for that day, schedule their echocardiogram within the next two weeks. 
 
Participants will return to the clinic the next day to return their ABPM/HBPM devices  and 
actigraphy (Actiwatch) devices  and the participant device log.  
  
 
Upon returning the devices , the technician will:  
1. Review the device log with the participant, verifying times the participant went to sleep, 
woke up, and took device(s) off. If the participant does not return the device log (or it is 
blank), be sure to fill it  out at the return visit. 
2. Download the data from the ABPM , HBPM,  and actigraphy devices.  
3. Confirm that at least 35 of planned ABPM readings are valid or all three HBPM readings 
are valid.  If this is not the case, the participant will be offered the opportunity to complete a second ABPM  or HBPM  (along with actigraphy and filling out the participant 
device log).  
 For participants who have a complete ABPM (or for those who have the device picked up at their house), the participant device log will be checked for completeness, scanned and saved electronically.  Next, we will administer the post- ABPM study visit form . 
 
Upon completion of the physical exam and echocardiogram, we will then process their 
reimbursement. The participants will receive reimbursement through the mail. 
 
When clinic staff will handle the return of the ABPM /HBPM :   
For participants for whom the device is picked up at their house or who mail in the device, the 
forms/device will be delivered to the clinic  staff. The staff member will check to confirm that at 
least 35 valid ABPM readings or 3 valid HBPM readings were obtained and that the post -ABPM 
questionnaire has been completed. If ≥ 35 valid ABPM readings are obtained, they will be 
processed as described in the manual of procedures.

 16 Overview of Better BP  Study Visit s 
 
The Better BP  study involves five  visits. Ideally, all five  visits will occur within 24-48 hours of 
each other.  For some participants the next visit will not occur within this timeframe; however, 
the next visit should be scheduled as soon as possible.   
 
The screening visit will take approximatel y 10 minutes to conduct including signing of the 
consent form and blood pressure screening. If eligible, the participant will continue on with their 
first study visit.  
 
The first study visit will take approximately 45 minutes to conduct including the initi al five -minute 
rest prior to obtaining clinic blood.  This visit includes confirming eligibility, obtaining three clinic blood pressure measurements both attended and unattended (randomized order), and completing two questionnaires ( Sociodemographic/Medical History and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index). The visits for this study will be conducted in a separate room or, at minimum, in an area 
properly screened from all other activity and participants  in the UAB Hypertension Research 
Clinic.   
 
The second study visit will include an additional three clinic blood pressure measurements, both attended and unattended, in the reverse order of visit 1 and fitting the participant for the ABPM  
or HBPM device (randomized) and Actiwatch.  
 
The third study visit will include the participant returning their device (ABPM or HBPM) and device log, confirmation that an adequate number of blood pressure readings were obtained, and completion of a post -ABPM or post-HBPM questionnaire (based on the device worn 
previously ). The participant will then be fitted for the opposite device (either ABPM or HBPM) 
and receive a device log.  The fourth study visit will include the participant returning their device (ABPM or HBPM) and device log, confirmation that an adequate number of blood pressure readings were obtained, 
and completion of a post -ABPM or post-HBPM questionnaire (based on the device worn 
previously). They will also complete the comparability questionnaire. The participant will have a 
brief physical exam w hich includes a non-fasting blood draw and spot urine collection. Finally, 
the participant will complete an echocardiogram. Upon completion of the echocardiogram, 
participants will receive reimbursement through the mail.

Preparation for Visit 1 (Day of Appointment – before the participant arrives to the UAB 
Hypertension Research Clinic) 
• Just prior to the scheduled appointment, the research coordinator (RC) should do the 
following:  
• Confirm the participant is eligible:  
o  Is their screening SBP between 110-159 mm Hg or DBP between 70-99 mm Hg 
and SBP < 160 mm Hg and DBP < 100 mm Hg? 
o Not currently taking antihypertensive medication? 
o No h istory of myocardial infarction, stroke, or arrhythmias?  
o Not currently pregnant? 
o Do they have an arm available for placement of a BP cuff? 
o Arm circumference <=52 cm?   
o Can rest their arm every 30 minutes for 24 hours to allow for a BP 
measurement?  
o Has not had an ABPM in the past year? 
o Does not work at night (or is completing ABPM on a non-work day with a one day  
wait following working the night shift)?    
o Is willing to return to the clinic  after both the ABPM and HBPM periods to return 
the devices?  
o STOP -BANG score less than 4? 
o Do you have a permanent residence? 
 
• Enable REDCap Mobile with the questionnaires (Sociodemographic/Medical History and 
PSQI). 
• Initialize the WatchBP Office AFIB device. 
• Have the WatchBP Office AFIB device set up for the correct measurement intervals [ 5-
minute initial rest period and 1-minute interval between readings].  
  
For participants who consent for the Better BP study  at the beginning of study visit 1, 
please ask the participant if he/she needs to use the restroom  prior to their 
height/weight/waist/neck measurements . 
 
Use the Study Visit 1  Data Collection Form to record information from the first  study 
visit.

 19 COVID- 19 Screening Procedures 
 
Prior to the participant entering the building or exam room for each in-person study visit , the 
research coordinator should complete the following:  
1. Symptom Tracker (remotely within 24 hours prior to the in- person visit AND when they 
arrive at their in-person visit)  
 
2. Temperature Check (when they arrive at the in-person visit)  
 
If the participant screens positive (i.e. any of the symptoms on the symptom tracker or have 
a fever > 100.4o), please refer them for testing at their primary care physician. If they do not 
have a primary care physician, please use the link below to register them for COVID -19 testing 
at an approved UAB site. 
 
UAB COVID-19 Testing Registration E -form:  
https://irap-apps.ad.uab.edu/covidtestrequest/  
 
If the primary care physician oversees COVID -19 testing for the research participant, written 
documentation of a negative test result  will need to be provided by the participant or 
physician to the research study team within 4 days of testing in order to proceed with research 
activities.  
 Upon completion of the e-form, a nurse from the COVID testing team will contact the research 
study team to register the research participant for COVID -19 testing. The COVID testing team 
nurse will also provide detailed instructions on the UAB testing location in addition to what to expect when they confirm the COVID-19 testing appointment. The results of the test  will be 
communicated by the testing team nurse to the research subject and the research team within 24-48 hours. 
 
COVID -19 testing will be billed to the participant’s health insurance (without a deductible 
applied) OR will be covered through alternative means (such as through the CARES act funding or otherwise). The participant will not be billed directly.  
 
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 20 If a participant screens positive during their study visits (i.e. after the completion of 
study visit 1), they have up to 3 days t o complete their next study visit. 
 If they are unable to complete their next study visit within 3 days, they will be 
allowed to restart the study from Study Visit 1 and receive full compensation again for their 
completion of the study.

 34 Measurement s 
 
Neck Circumference Measurement  
Participants will be asked to stand with their head held erect and eyes facing forward. They will 
be asked to breathe normally. If the participant has long hair, please ask them to pull it up and away from their neck.   
 
 A flexible tape measure ( AdvoCare) will be used to measure neck circumference at the level of 
the cricothyroid membrane (thyroid cartilage or Adam’s apple). 
 Neck circumference should be recorded to the nearest 0.1 centimeter.   
Arm Circumference Measurement (non-dominant arm)  
  
The participant should remove his/her upper garment, or clear the upper arm area so that an 
unencumbered measurement may be made.  The technician should:  
• Have the participant stand, with the non- dominant  arm hanging and bending the 
elbow so that the forearm is  horizontal (parallel) to the floor.  
• Measure their arm length from the acromion (bony protuberance at the shoulder) 
to the olecranon (tip of the elbow), using the AdvoCare anthropometric tape.  
• Mark the midpoint on the dorsal surface of the arm.  
• Have the participant relax  their arm alongside of the body.  
• Draw the tape snugly around the arm at the midpoint mark.  Note: Tape should 
be horizontal and should not indent the skin.  
• Noting the arm circumference indicated by the tape to the nearest tenth of a 
centimeter, use the criteria above for determining cuff size.  Note:  If >  52 cm, 
the participant will be excluded from the study.

Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 54 ABPM Procedures  
 
Use the Better BP Study Visit 2 and Study Visit 3 Data Collection Form s to record information 
from the second and third study visit.  
 
Testing the ABP M Device and Fitting Participant with Equipment  
1. The appropriate cuff size should be ready (see arm circumference measurement on Study 
Visit Form 1 to verify correct size).  P lace the cuff  on the participant’s non-dominant arm.  If the 
non-dominant arm cannot be used, use the participant’s dominant arm  (this will require 
using a bladder positioned for the other arm ). The cuff must be placed against the skin (not over 
any clothing). Locate the brachial artery by palpation and mark the skin with a small dot, using a 
black pen. (The brachial artery is usually found just medial and superior to the cubital fossa, 
posterior to the biceps muscle and slightly toward the body.) For brachial artery  palpation, 
fingertips or thumb may be used. Refer to the Participant Instructions.  
2. The research coordinator will explain to the participant that the cuff will feel tight during the 
first measurement. The participant will be instructed that the ABPM will inflate the cuff to a 
pressure between 170 and 180 mmHg, but this will only occur on the first reading.  Each 
subsequent reading will go only 20 mmHg higher than the previous systolic reading. The 
research coordinator will instruct the participant that a tone will go off during the daytime to alert them that a reading is about to occur.   
3. During recordings, the participant is instructed to: (1) remain as still as possible, (2) keep 
his/her arm relaxed at his/her side or at heart level as if in a s ling or resting on a table or 
armrest , and (3) refrain from talking The research coordinator should demonstrate the 
appropriate arm positioning to the study participant. 
4. Next, a blood pressure reading should be taken using the ABPM device to confirm it  is 
working properly. The research coordinator  will press the On/Off button and place the device in 
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 55 ‘Ambulatory’ mode. The purpose of taking an initial reading is to make sure the cuff inflates and 
deflates as expected. Once one successful reading is ac quired, proceed to the next step. If the 
cuff does not inflate and then deflate, then check that batteries are properly inserted and if so, initialize a new ABPM device for use.  Also, if three readings are attempted and all result in errors, then a new ABPM device will be initialized for use.  If either of the above occurs, the 
research coordinator will email Paul Muntner (
pmuntner@uab.edu) to inform them of a non-
functioning device.  
5. Final fitting of the ABPM  device:  the non-latex red tubing should go around the back of the 
participant’s neck and come down the dominant side of his/her body. Usually, it is placed 
underneath the participant’s clothing, coming out at the waist or between two button holes of the 
shirt. The pouch with the ABPM device can be 1) placed in a jacket pocket, 2) hooked onto a 
belt (using the loop on the back of the pouch), or 3) worn with a shoulder strap connected by 2 
black plastic  tabs to the inside edges of the pouch. 
6. The research coordinator  will explain how the ABPM device  works to the participant, noting 
that every 30 minutes  the ABPM device will automatically make a BP measurement.   
7. The research coordinator will show the participant the phone number for the research team . 
This is located inside the Participant Instructions that will be provided to them.  Therefore, the 
participant can call with any questions or concerns about any of the equipment.  Also, the 
research coordinator will show the participant the number to call for the research coordinator 
during regular business hours .  For after hours’ calls, participants will be provided with a cell 
phone number for one of the study staff members  familiar with the study.   
8. The participant will be informed that if an ABPM measureme nt fails, usually because of 
motion (including driving), talking, or because the arm is not relaxed, the device will attempt another measurement 2 minutes later.  If this repeat attempt fails, no further attempts will be 
made until the next scheduled reading 30 minutes later.   
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 56 9. The participant will then be told that in the very unlikely event the cuff does not deflate after 
a reading, the On/Off  circular button on the ABPM device should be pressed (shown in picture 
above) .  The cuff should automatically deflate. If the cuff still does not deflate, the participant 
should turn off the device.  To do so, they will hold the On/Off  circular button for three seconds. 
Once the cuff has deflated, the participant can push the On/Off  circular button to turn the device 
back on.  Then, they can resume wearing the device as before (i.e., they can place the device 
back in the pouch) and their blood pressure should be measured every 30 minutes. 
10. At this time, the research coordinator should tell  the participant that the ABPM device will 
continue to obtain recordings during sleep. The participant is told that the device is programmed 
so that during the daytime, the ABPM device will emit a tone immediately before each BP 
measurement to signal that the cuff is about to be inflated; however, during the participant’s 
usual sleep hours, this tone is turned off.   
11. The research coordinator will then ask the participant to avoid getting the ABPM 
device wet, but mention that there is no personal danger to the participa nt if the ABPM 
device does get wet.  The research coordinator will ask the participant to keep the 
equipment dry at all times. We prefer that participants not shower, swim, or go to the 
gym during the 24 hours they are wearing the ABPM device.  However, if  this is 
absolutely not possible, then the equipment should be removed before showering, swimming or engaging in vigorous activity.  Each time the participant removes equipment he/she should log the time the equipment was removed as well as the time it was put back on (see ABPM Device Log; Appendix 2 ). 
12. The research coordinator  will show the participant how to remove and put back on the 
ABPM device.  
13. To remove ABPM device, the research coordinator  instructs the participant to pull the 
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 57 Velcro flap away from his/her body and slide the cuff down off his/her arm.  
14. The participant is told to gently pull the white tubing over his/her head and away from 
his/her body.   15. To put the ABPM device back on, the participant is instructed to place the cuff on his/her 
non-dominant arm, lead the white tubing behind his/her neck and let it rest by his/her opposite 
side.  The arrow on the bottom of the cuff should be pointing down and situated over the brachial artery , about 1 inch above the bend in the elbow.  If the participant does not know 
where the brachial artery is located, the research coordinator  will offer to mark it with a pen (if 
this has not already been done) so that the participant can be assured the cuff is situated properly. 
16. The researcher will ask  the participant to demonstrate to them how to properly remove and 
replace the device before moving forward. 
17. Next, the research coordinator  will show the participant how to remove and replace the 
Actiwatch devic e (see Participant Instructions).

 61 Buffer:  
We will buffer both the sleep and awakening times by at least 30 minutes so that the tone will 
not awaken participants.  Remember the sleep/awake time settings on the O3 ABPM  device can 
only be set to the hour.  Take the participant’s anticipated wake-up time, add 30 minutes, and 
round up to the next hour; take the participant’s anticipated sleep time, subtract 30 minutes, and 
round down to the next hour. Here are three examples of how sleep and awake times will be set 
during the initialization process:  
- A participant who reports going to bed at 11pm and waking up at 6am will 
have their sleep time set to 10pm to 7am.   
- A participant who reports going to bed at 11:30pm and waking up at 6:30am 
will have their sleep time set to 11pm to 7am.   
- A participant who reports going to bed at 11:15pm and waking up at 6:15am 
will have their sleep time set to 10pm to 7am.

 65 HBPM Procedures  
 
Use the Better BP Study Visit 2 and Study Visit 3 Data Collection Form s to record information 
from the second and third study visit.  
 
Testing the HBPM Device and Fitting Participant with Equipment  
1. The appropriate cuff size should be ready (see arm circumference measurement on Study 
Visit Form 1 to verify correct size).   
2. Demonstrate to the participant how to place the cuff on their non-dominant arm.  If the 
non-dominant arm cannot be used, use the participant’s dominant arm  (this will require 
using a bladder positioned for the other arm ). The cuff must be placed against the skin (not over 
any clothing). Locate the brachial artery by palpation and mark the skin with a small dot, using a 
black pen. (The brachial artery is usually found just medial and superior to the cubital fossa, 
posterior to the biceps muscle and slightly toward the body.) For brachial artery  palpation, 
fingertips or thumb may be used.  
3. The research coordinator will explain to the participant that the cuff will feel tight during the 
first measurement. The participant will be instructed that the H BPM will inflate the cuff to a 
pressure between 170 and 180 mmHg, but this will only occur on the first reading.  Each subsequent reading will go only 20 mmHg higher than the previous systolic reading .  
4. The research coordinator will inform the participant that to begin their recordings they 
should press and hold the On/Off  button for 3 seconds to begin the initial reading.  
5. Next, a reading should be taken to confirm the device is working properly. The research 
coordinator  will press the On /Off button and place the device in ‘ Casual ’ mode. The first reading 
will be based on the device’s internal algorithm. The purpose is to make sure the cuff inflates and deflates as expected. Once one successful reading is ac quired, proceed to the next step. If 
the cuff does not inflate and then deflate, then check that batteries are properly inserted and if 
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 66 so, initialize a new HBPM device for use.  Also, if three readings are attempted and al l result in 
errors, then a new HBPM device will be initialized for use.  If either of the above occurs, the 
resear ch coordinator will email Paul Muntner ( pmuntner@uab.edu) to inform him  of a non-
functional device.  
6. The research coordinator  will explain how the H BPM device  works to the participant. Note 
that the HBPM device will automatically take a blood pressure reading at 2, 3, and 4 hours after 
the initial reading.   
7. At this time, the research coordinator tells the participant that the HBP M device will 
continue to obtain recordings during sleep.  
8. The research coordinator will show the participant the phone number for the research team 
is located inside the Participant Instructions that will be provided to them.  Therefore, the 
participant can call with any questions or concerns about any of the equipment.  Also, the research coordinator will show the participant the number to call for the research coordinator 
during regular business hours.  For after hours’ calls, participants will be provided with a cell 
phone number for one of the study staff members familiar with the study.   
9. The research coordinator will ask the participant to keep the equipment dry at all times. The 
participant should log the time they went to bed and the time they wake up in the morning. If the 
participant removes equipment dur ing the night, he/she should log the time the equipment was 
removed as well as the time it was put back on (see HBPM Device Log; Appendix 2).  
10. The research coordinator will show the participant how to put the H BPM device on, the 
participant is instructed to place the cuff on his/her non-dominant arm, lead the white tubing 
behind his/her neck and let it rest by his/her opposite side.  The arrow on the bottom of the cuff should be pointing down and situated over the brachial artery, about 1 inch above the bend in 
the elbow.  If the participant does not know where the brachial artery is located, the research 
coordinator will offer to mark it with a pen (if this has not already been done) so that the 
Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 67 participant can be assured the cuff is situated properly. The research coordinator will inform the 
participant that they should place the device on their nightstand by the bed or under their pillow.  
11. The researcher will ask  the participant to demonstrate to them how to properly place the 
device before moving forward. 
12. Next, the research coordinator will show the participant how to remove and replace the 
Actiwatch device.

 73 Fitting the Actiwatch 
 
1. Next, the research coordinator  will explain to the participant how the Actiwatch works . 
The participant will be told the Actiwatch should be worn on the wrist of the non-
dominant arm, the same arm as the BP cuff, and that it will provide a measure of his/her 
overall sleep.  
2. The research coordinator  will place the Actiwatch on the wrist of the participant’s non -
dominant arm , and then ask the participant to avoid getting the Actiwatch wet. We 
would prefer that the light sensor on the device be on the outside of the wrist. 
3. After reviewing this information, the research coordinator will ask the participant if they  
have any questions regarding the Actiwatch.  
4. Next, the research coordinator will review the Participant Instructions (see Appendix 3) 
with the participant and remind him/her that if anything should happen with the equipment in the 
next 24 hours, he/she should contact the research team immediately using one of the phone 
numbers provided.   
5. The research coordinator  will thank the participant and confirm how  the participant will bring 
back the ABP M/HBPM and Actiwatch devices along with the Device  Log (Appendix 2) (see 
procedures for returning the equipment and Device Log below). Be sure to instruct the 
participant where he/she should record their sleep and w ake times on the Device Log 
(Appendix 1), and any times the equipment was removed.  
6. Finally, the participant should be given the Participant Instructions (see Appendix 3). 
The participant should be informed of how to contact the research coordinators if he/she has a 
question/concern. The location of this information in the Participant Instructions should be 
shown to the participants.

 102 Echocardiograms  
 
Cardiac measurements will be obtained according to the 2015 recommendations* of the American 
Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI). 
Left ventricular (LV) measurements for LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd), septal wall thickness 
(SWTd), and posterior wall thickness (PWTd) will be obtained.  
 
LVM (grams) will be determined using the ASE formula. LVMI will be calculated as LVM divided by 
body surface area (g/m2) and secondarily by dividing by height2.7 (g/m2.7).  
 
The following are additional measures to be conducted:  
• Shortening (FS, %)  
• LV systolic function defined by LV ejection fraction (LVEF, %) = 100 x (LVEDV -LVESV) / 
LVEDV using modified Simpson’s rule.  
 
The following are measures that may be obtained at a future date. Imaging will be conducted now to 
capture these items, but measurements will not be performed.  
• LV diastolic function: E/A ratio, E’ (c m/s), A’ (c m/s), E/E’ ratio, isovolumetric relaxation time 
(ms), deceleration time (ms) 
• Other parameters:  Left atrial volume (mL ), right ventricular fractional area change, tricuspid 
annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid annulus s’, and global longitudinal 
strain (GLS) 
• Hemodynamics: stroke volume (SV, mL) = VTI x cross-sectional area LVOT; heart rate (HR); 
cardiac output (L/min) = SV x HR

 103 Adult Transthoracic Echocardiogram Protocol  
 
Note: Heart Rate should be continuously  documented on screen during image acquisition.  
Heart rate is needed to calculate different formulae. All spectral Doppler should be displayed 
at a sweep speed of 100 mm/sec. 
 
Also, the disk (CD or DVD) should be labeled with a participant ID#. 
 
A.  Parasternal Long Axis: 
 
1. Show at increased depth to show extra-
cardiac structures.  
2.  Decrease depth and then show at least 3 
beats in parasternal long axis view for LV 
wall motion. LV chamber and wall thickness measurements will be performed using 2D -
guided linear measurements (see Figure 1). 
3. Zoom on aortic valve. Show aortic valve and LVOT (for diameter measurements). 
 4.  Perform Color Doppler of aortic valve. 
  
B.  Parasternal Short Axis: 
1. Will not obtain images. 
  
      
  

Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 104 C. Apical Views:  
1. Start 2D with the apical four -chamber view at 
increased depth to show extra- cardiac structures.  
 
2.  Decrease depth and show the LV in apical four -
chamber view  for at least 3 beats.  This view will be 
used for LVEF assessment (using modified Simpson’s 
rule).  
 
Then optimally show the left atrium for assessment of 
left atrial volume (see Figure 2). Put Color Doppler on 
the mitral valve to show a complete jet of r egurgitation 
if any is present.  
 
Interrogate the mitral valve with PW Doppler with the 
sample volume at the tips of the mitral leaflets (show E 
and A waves).  Show for at least 3 beats. If mitral stenosis is present, switch 
to CW Doppler, and show enough of E and A waves for assessment of 
mean gradient and pressure half -time.  
 
Perform DTI of mitral annulus (lateral and medial) and show e’ and a’.  
Show for at least 3 beats for each annulus.  
 
Show RV for size and function in apical four -chamber view for at least 3 
beats.  Switch to M -mode for assessment of tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE). Show for at least 3 beats. Finally, switch to DTI of 
tricuspid annulus. Show for at least 3 beats  
 
Angle and show the apical five- chamber view  for at least 3 beats. 
Then interrogate across AV and LVOT with CW Doppler. If increased 
gradient is present, slide the sample volume using PW from the LV apex, down the LVOT, and to the AV to pinpoint the area of increased gradient. Once area of increased gradient  is identified, switch to CW Doppler and 
show the peak resting gradient for at least 3 beats.  
  
Fi  2  

Better BP Study: Manual of Operations    
 105 Perform PW Doppler of the LVOT for the assessment of LVOT VTI for at least 3 
beats.  
 
3. Also, in the apical five- chamber view , 
using CW Doppler, place the sample volume 
at the junction of the LVOT and the anterior mitral leaflet to capture both LVOT mitral valve inflow profiles (see Figure 3).  
 
4.  Rotate to apical two -chamber view:  
show the LV at least 3 beats for LVEF 
assessme nt. Then optimally show the left 
atrium for assessment of left atrial volume (see Figure 2). Put Color Doppler on the 
mitral valve to show a complete jet of regurgitation if any is present.  
 
5. Rotate to apical three -chamber view:  show the LV at least 3 beats. Put Color 
Doppler on the mitral valve to show a complete jet of regurgitation if any is present.

 108 Protocol for Handling Echocardiograms  
 
1. Participants will return to the Hypertension Clinic on the day of their echocardiogram 
appointment. 
2. The study coordinator  will provide the participant with a sealed envelope which contains the 
following:  
a. Two pre-made labels for the DVDs with the participant ID number and date  
b. A hand-written reminder card with the participant  name and ID number  
c. An instruction sheet for the sonographer on how to enter the participant information 
into the PACS system before downloading the scan onto the DVD  
3. The participant will take the envelope with them to the Echo Lab and give it to the 
sonographer . If the study coordinator is not with a participant, he/she should offer to escort 
the participant to the echo lab.  
4. The study coordinator  will go pick up the DVDs from the Echo Lab receptionist desk before 
the end of the day. If he/she is not available, he/she  will contact the alternate(s)  to pick up the 
DVD.  
5. The person who picks up the DVD will enter into the REDCap database that the 
echocardiograms have been retrieved from the Echo Lab. 
6. The study coordinator  will check the echo scans every Monday  to confirm there is no PHI and 
that the participant information (i.e. – participant ID number) is accurate  
a. Each reviewed DVD will be labeled with a colored sticky dot and initialed by the 
reviewer so that we can confirm that they have been reviewed and by  whom.  
b. The reviewer will also enter that the DVD has been reviewed into REDCap on the 
‘Echocardiogram’ form.  
7. All DVDs  that have been reviewed will be shipped to CUMC every Monday with the exception 
of holidays. If Monday is a holiday, the DVDs will be shipped  on Tuesdays.

 135 Consent Form (Study Participant)  
 
Title of Research:  Evaluating Novel Approaches for Estimating Awake and Sleep 
Blood Pressure –Better BP study. 
UAB IRB Protocol #:  IRB-300001727 
Principal Investigator:  Paul Muntner, PhD 
Sponsor:  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  (NHLBI)  
 
General Information  You are being asked to take part in a research study. This research 
study is voluntary, meaning you do not have to take part in it. The procedures, risks, and benefits are fully described in the consent 
form.  
Purpose  The purpose of the study is to test whether blood pressure measured 
in a clinic setting without medical staff present is comparable to blood pressure levels measured during the daytime outside of the clinic.  Also, we will test whether blood pressure can be accurately measured while you’re asleep using a new home blood pressure 
monitoring device.   
Duration & Visits  You will be in this study for approximately 1 to 2 weeks. You will 
come to the UAB Hypertension Research Clinic for four study visits.  
Overvi ew of 
Procedures  Prior to the start of this study, you will have your blood pressure 
measured two times in the clinic to confirm your eligibility.  
 During this study, you will have your blood pressure measured in the clinic a total of twelve times during the first two study visits. You will wear a device called an ambulatory blood pressure monitor that measures your blood pressure every 30 minutes for 24 hours and wear a home blood pressure monitor for one night while you sleep.   Also, you will complete questionnaires regarding your demographics, medical history, your sleeping habits and your experience wearing both the ambulatory blood pressure monitor and home blood pressure monitor.  
You will conclude the study with a brief physical exam, which includes blood and urine collection and an echocardiogram (a procedure that involves getting a picture of your heart image with a 
wand that is rubbed on your skin).  
Risks  The most common risk is minimal discomfort and/or skin irritation 
from the inflation of the blood pressure cuff every 30 minutes for 24 
hours.  You may also experience difficulty sleeping while having 
your blood pressure measured.  
Benefits  We will provide you with your blood pressure measurements and the 
results from the echocardiogram. Also, the principal investigator hopes that the information from this study will be able to provide knowledge that will improve the measurement of blood pressure for 
patients in the future.  
 
 
 136 Purpose of the Research Study  
For many people, blood pressure levels differ when measured in a doctor’s office versus during 
normal daily activities. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, also called ABPM, involves wearing a blood pressure cuff attached to a device that is programmed to measure your blood pressure every 30 minutes for a 24- hour period.  ABPM can help better estimate a person’s true 
average blood pressure.  Although ABPM is recommended for diagnosing high blood pressure and it also measures blood pressure while people sleep, it is not available in many clinic s and 
some people find the procedure to be uncomfortable. The purpose of this research study is to test whether blood pressure measured in a clinic setting without medical staff present is comparable to blood pressure levels measured during the daytime measured using an ABPM device.  Also, we will test whether asleep blood pressure can be accurately measured using a home blood pressure monitoring device.  These findings may help identify new approaches for diagnosing high blood pressure without the need for ABPM. We will enroll a total of 660 participants at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and Columbia University in New York. UAB will enroll 330 adults who recently had a doctor’s visit and are not currently taking a blood pressure lowering medication to take part in this study. Each participant will complete four study visits.  
Study Participation & Procedures  
We are asking you to take part in a research study. If you enroll, you will be asked to visit the UAB Hypertension Research Clinic, locat ed at 933 19
th Street South, four times for this study. 
Ideally, the study visits will occur on four consecutive days.  However, the timing of the visits will be determined by your availability and that of the study staff.  During the course of the study, you will:  
 
• During the screening process, you will have your blood pressure measured two times in the clinic by study staff to confirm your eligibility.  
• Have your blood pressure measured in the clinic, six times at each of the first two 
study visits for a total of twelve blood pressure measurements).  
• Sign a medical release form for us to review your medical records from the past 
three months and record your blood pressure levels as measured when you visit your doctor’s office. 
• Complete questionnaires about your demographics, medical history, and your sleeping habits.  
• Have 4 tablespoons of blood drawn and provide a sample of your urine. 
• Wear a Food and Drug Administration- approved ABPM device (Microlife 
WatchBP O3) for 24 hours. 
• Wear a Food and Drug Administr ation -approved home blood pressure monitor 
(Microlife WatchBP Home N) while you sleep for one night. 
• Wear an activity monitor (Actiwatch) for two 24-hour periods. The Actiwatch activity monitor is like a watch worn on your wrist and it measures your activity levels and can be used to identify when you are asleep. 
• Answer some questions about your experience while wearing the ABPM and 
home blood pressure monitoring 
• Have an echocardiogram performed. An echocardiogram is a procedure where a 
wand is rubbed along your ribcage, under your shirt, to obtain an image of your heart.  
 
 137  
First UAB Hypertension Center visit  
At the beginning of this visit, we will ask you to sign this form agreeing to participate in the 
study. Prior to beginning any study procedures, a staff member will measure your blood pressure two times separated by a I -minute interval following a 5-minute rest period using an automated 
blood pressured device. These measurements will be used to confirm that you are eligible to participate in this study. T o be eligible, your systolic blood pressure will need to be greater than 
or equal to 110 mm Hg and your diastolic blood pressure will need to be greater than or equal to 70 mm Hg. Your systolic blood pressure will need to be less than 160 mm Hg and your di astolic 
blood pressure will need to be less than 100 mm Hg. Additionally, we will ask you questions about your sleep and measure your neck circumference. If you are eligible to participate, we will continue your first visit by measuring your arm circumfere nce and medical staff will take your 
blood pressure three times using a machine, similar to how it is done in your doctor ' s office. We will also measure your blood pressure three times using the same machine after it is programmed to measure your blood pressure without staff being present. You will be randomly picked (like the flip of a coin) by a computer to have your blood pressure measured by staff first, followed by the automated measurements or to have your blood pressure measured by the automated de vice 
first and then by a staff member. Next, you will complete a brief physical exam, which includes height, weight and waist circumference measurements. Finally, you will be asked to complete questionnaires at the conclusion of this visit. These questionnaires will ask you questions about your medical history, stress you may experience, and your sleeping habits. This visit will last about 45 minutes to one hour.  
Second visit at the UAB Hypertension Center 
Your second visit will ideally occur the day after  the first visit. At this visit, we will measure 
your blood pressure three times using a machine, similar to how it is done in your doctor’s office 
and three times using the same machine without another person in the room. The ordering of 
these blood press ure measurements will be the opposite of your first visit. For example, if your 
blood pressure is measured at the first visit without a staff member present three times and then 
with the staff member present then at the second visit your blood pressure wil l first be measured 
three times with the staff member present and then three times without the staff member present.  Next, you will be asked to wear one of two different types of blood pressure monitors (a Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device or a Microlife W atchBP Home N blood pressure device). 
Which device you will be asked to wear after the second visit will be randomly picked by a computer.  You will wear either the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device for 24 hours and then the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep b lood pressure device for one night or the Microlife 
WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device for one night and then the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device for 24 hours. You will also be asked to wear an Actiwatch activity monitor for the same duration as t he device you are assigned. This visit will last about 45 minutes to one hour. 
 
24-hour blood pressure recording  
Your blood pressure over 24 hours will be measured by a Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device. 
This device has an arm cuff, similar to the one your doctor uses to measure your blood pressure during an examination. The cuff is attached to a small monitor about t wo or three times larger 
than a cell phone. You will wear this part of the ABPM device on your waist. A study staff member who is trained to measure blood pressure will instruct you on how to use the ABPM device, and how to remove it if necessary. The ABPM device will take your blood pressure automatically every 30 minutes while you are awake and while you are asleep.   
 
 138 Asleep home blood pressure recording  
For the asleep home blood pressure recording, you will be given a Microlife WatchBP Home N 
home blood pressure monitoring device and cuff and instructed on how to put on the cuff and use the monitor properly.  This device has an arm cuff similar to what your doctor uses to measure your blood pressure during an examination. This will be attached to a device, which is two or three times larger than a cell phone. You will be asked to put on the cuff and start the device before going to bed and keep it on until you wake up in the morning.  The device will measure your blood pressure when you put it on and then three times while you sleep (at 2, 3, and 4 hours after you have gone to sleep). 
 
Third visit at the UAB Hypertension Center  
Your third visit will ideally occur the day after the second visit and involves returning the electronic device you were given during the second visit (either the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device or the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device)  and answering a 
questionnaire about your experiences with the device. You will then be provided with the blood pressure device you haven’t worn yet (either the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device or the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device) f or the next stage of the protocol. You 
will again wear an Actiwatch on your wrist for another 24 hours. A staff member from the clinic will instruct you how to use this device.  This visit will last about 30 minutes.   
Fourth visit at the UAB Hypertension Center  
Your fourth visit will ideally occur the day after the third visit and involves returning the devices 
you were given during the third visit and answering a written questionnaire about your experiences with the device you wore (either the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device or the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device). Next, a staff member will collect a sample of your blood and urine. You will then have an echocardiogram done (or scheduled within the next two weeks).  Upon completion of the echocardiogram, you will have successfully 
completed the study. An echocardiogram is a procedure where a wand is rubbed along your ribcage, under your shirt, to obtain an image of your heart.  The wand has some gel on it that may be cold.  This visit should last 45 minutes to one and a half hours depending on whether the echocardiogram is done at this visit or scheduled to occur at a later visit.  
 
Your de-identified private information and de-identified biospecimens (private information and biospecimen s with all identifiers removed) may be used for future research studies or distributed 
to another researcher for future research studies without additional informed consent. This is 
only when there are no identifiers associated with the data or biospecimen s
. 
 
Risks and Discomforts  
The following risks/discomforts may occur as a result of your participation in this study: There may be minimal pain or discomfort during the inflation of the blood pressure device arm cuffs (as might occur when your doctor takes your blood pressure). This discomfort is temporary and minor. Both the Microlife WatchBP O3 and the Microlife WatchBP Home N blood pressure monitoring devices take measurements while you sleep. This may produce some disturbance of your sleep. You may also experience bruising or skin irritation from wearing the blood pressure devices.  
 
Questionnaires will include potentially sensitive information concerning possible sources of stress. It is possible that you could feel temporarily upset, tired, or anxious when reporting this 
 
 139 information. If you need to talk with someone, we can consult the principal investigator, a 
counselor, social worker, or chaplain. 
 
There may be some slight discomfort when taking a blood sample and you may experience bruising, soreness, and pain at the site of the needle stick. A trained technician will draw your 
blood and every effort will be made to minimize any discomfort. The risk of infection is minimal, and only sterile materials will be used.  
 There may also be risks that are unkn own at this time. You will be given more information if other 
risks are found. 
 
Benefits  
Every research participant has the opportunity to receive a report with their 24 -hour blood 
pressure recording, lab results, and an echocardiogram. Blood pressure measured on ABPM has been shown to provide information above and beyond the usual measurements taken in the doctor’s office. An echocardiogram provides information on how well your heart pumps your blood to the rest of your body.  This can be used to detect if your heart is not pumping blood as well as it should.  These results will be shared with you and your doctor if you would like. Please initial your choice below to indicate whether you would like us to send you a report describing your study results:

 145 Consent Form (Mock Participant)  
 
Title of Research:  Evaluating Novel Approaches for Estimating Awake and Sleep 
Blood Pressure –Better BP study. 
 UAB IRB Protocol #:  IRB-300001727 
 Principal Investigator:  Paul Muntner, PhD 
 Sponsor:  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  (NHLBI)  
 
General Information  You are being asked to take part in a research study. This research 
study is voluntary, meaning you do not have to take part in it. The procedures, risks, and benefits are fully described in the consent 
form.  
Purpose  The purpose of the study is to test whether blood pressure measured 
in a clinic setting without medical staff present is comparable to blood pressure levels measured during the daytime outside of the clinic.  Also, we will test whether blood pressure can be accurately 
measured while you’re asleep using a new home blood pressure monitoring device. The purpose of the mock participants is to test 
protocol procedures before we recruit and enroll study participants.  
Duration & Visits  You will be in this study for approximately 1 to 2 weeks. You will 
come to the UAB Hypertension Research Clinic for four study visits.  
Overview of 
Procedures  During this study, you will have your blood pressure measured in the 
clinic a total of twelve ti mes during the first two study visits. You 
will wear a device called an ambulatory blood pressure monitor that measures your blood pressure every 30 minutes for 24 hours and wear a home blood pressure monitor for one night while you sleep.  
 Also, you will complete questionnaires regarding your demographics, medical history, your sleeping habits and your experience wearing both the ambulatory blood pressure monitor and home blood pressure monitor. 
 
You will conclude the study with a brief physical exam, which 
includes blood and urine collection and an echocardiogram (a procedure that involves getting a picture of your heart image with a wand that is rubbed on your skin). Your data will not be used in the 
study data analysis.  
Risks  The most common risk is mi nimal discomfort and/or skin irritation 
from the inflation of the blood pressure cuff every 30 minutes for 24 hours.  You may also experience difficulty sleeping while having 
your blood pressure measured.  
Benefits  We will provide you with your blood pressure measurements and the 
results from the echocardiogram. Also, the principal investigator 
hopes that the information from this study will be able to provide 
 
 146 knowledge that will improve the measurement of blood pres sure for 
patients in the future.  
 
  
 
 147 Purpose of the Research Study  
For many people, blood pressure levels differ when measured in a doctor’s office versus during 
normal daily activities. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, also called ABPM, involves wearing a blood pressure cuff attached to a device that is programmed to measure your blood pressure every 30 minutes for a 24- hour period.  ABPM can help better estimate a person’s true 
average blood pressure.  Although ABPM is recommended for diagnosing high blood pressure and it also measures blood pressure while people sleep, it is not available in many clinics and some people find the procedure to be uncomfortable. The purpose of this research study is to test whether blood pressure measured in a clinic setting without medical staff present is comparable to blood pressure levels measured during the daytime measured using an ABPM device.  Also, we will test whether asleep blood pressure can be accurately measured using a home blood pressure monitoring device.  These findings may help identify new approaches for diagnosing high blood pressure without the need for ABPM. We will enroll a total of 10 mock study participants at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and Columbia University in New York. UAB will enroll 5 adults who are not currently taking a blood pressure lowering 
medication to take part in this study. Each participant will complete four study visits. The purpose of the mock participants is to test protocol procedures.  
Study Participati on & Procedures  
We are asking you to take part in a research pilot study. If you enroll, you will be asked to visit the UAB Hypertension Research Clinic, located at 933 19
th Street South, four times for this 
study. Ideally, the study visits will occur on four consecutive days.  However, the timing of the visits will be determined by your availability and that of the study staff.  During the course of the study, you will:  
 
• Have your blood pressure measured in the clinic, six times at each of the first two study visits for a total of twelve blood pressure measurements). 
• Complete questionnaires about your demographics, medical history, and your 
sleeping habits.  
• Have 4 tablespoons of blood drawn and provide a sample of your urine. 
• Wear a Food and Drug Administration -approved ABPM device (Microlife 
WatchBP O3) for 24 hours. 
• Wear a Food and Drug Administration-approved home blood pressure monitor 
(Microlife WatchBP Home N) while you sleep for one night. 
• Wear an activity monitor (Actiwatch) for two 24-hour periods. The Actiwatch 
activity monitor is like a watch worn on your wrist and it measures your activity 
levels and can be used to identify when you are asleep. 
• Answer some questions about your experience while wearing the ABPM and home blood pressure monitoring  
• Have an echocardiogram performed. An echocardiogram is a procedure where a wand is rubbed along your ribcage, under your shirt, to obtain an image of your heart.  
 
First UAB Hypertension Center visit  
At this visit, we will ask you to sign this form agreeing to participate in the study and a form that will allow us to retrieve your medical records from the past three months.  Additionally, we will ask you questions about your sleep and measure your neck circumference. Next, we will measure 
 
 148 your arm ci rcumference and medical staff will take your blood pressure three times using a 
machine, similar to how it is done in your doctor’s office.  We will also measure your blood 
pressure three times using the same machine after it is programmed to measure your blood 
pressure without staff being present.  You will be randomly picked (like the flip of a coin) by a computer to have your blood pressure measured by staff first, followed by the automated measurements or to have your blood pressure measured by the automated device first and then by a staff member.  Next, you will complete a brief physical exam, which includes height, weight and waist circumference measurements. Finally, you will be asked to complete questionnaires at the conclusion of this visit.  These questionnaires will ask you questions about your medical history, stress you may experience, and your sleeping habits. This visit will last about 45 minutes to one hour.  
Second visit at the UAB Hypertension Center 
Your second visit will ideally occur the  day after the first visit. At this visit, we will measure 
your blood pressure three times using a machine, similar to how it is done in your doctor’s office 
and three times using the same machine without another person in the room. The ordering of these b lood pressure measurements will be the opposite of your first visit. For example, if your 
blood pressure is measured at the first visit without a staff member present three times and then with the staff member present then at the second visit your blood pr essure will first be measured 
three times with the staff member present and then three times without the staff member present.  Next, you will be asked to wear one of two different types of blood pressure monitors (a Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device or a M icrolife WatchBP Home N blood pressure device). 
Which device you will be asked to wear after the second visit will be randomly picked by a computer.  You will wear either the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device for 24 hours and then the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device for one night or the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device for one night and then the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device for 24 hours. You will also be asked to wear an Actiwatch activity monitor for the 
same dur ation as the device you are assigned. This visit will last about 45 minutes to one hour. 
 
24-hour blood pressure recording  
Your blood pressure over 24 hours will be measured by a Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device. 
This device has an arm cuff, similar to the one your doctor uses to measure your blood pressure during an examination. The cuff is attached to a small monitor about two or three times larger than a cell phone. You will wear this part of the ABPM device on your waist. A study staff member who is tra ined to measure blood pressure will instruct you on how to use the ABPM 
device, and how to remove it if necessary. The ABPM device will take your blood pressure automatically every 30 minutes while you are awake and while you are asleep.   
Asleep home blood pressure recording  
For the asleep home blood pressure recording, you will be given a Microlife WatchBP Home N 
home blood pressure monitoring device and cuff and instructed on how to put on the cuff and use the monitor properly.  This device has an arm cuff similar to what your doctor uses to measure your blood pressure during an examination. This will be attached to a device, which is two or three times larger than a cell phone. You will be asked to put on the cuff and start the device before going to bed and keep it on until you wake up in the morning.  The device will measure your blood pressure when you put it on and then three times while you sleep (at 2, 3, and 4 hours after you have gone to sleep). 
 
Third visit at the UAB Hypertension Center  
 
 149 Your thi rd visit will ideally occur the day after the second visit and involves returning the 
electronic device you were given during the second visit (either the Microlife WatchBP O3 
ABPM device or the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device) and answering a questionnaire about your experiences with the device. You will then be provided with the blood pressure device you haven’t worn yet (either the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device or the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device) for the n ext stage of the protocol. You 
will again wear an Actiwatch on your wrist for another 24 hours. A staff member from the clinic will instruct you how to use this device.  This visit will last about 30 minutes.   
Fourth visit at the UAB Hypertension Center  
Your fourth visit will ideally occur the day after the third visit and involves returning the devices 
you were given during the third visit and answering a written questionnaire about your experiences with the device you wore (either the Microlife WatchBP O3 ABPM device or the Microlife WatchBP Home N sleep blood pressure device). Next, a staff member will collect a sample of your blood and urine. You will then have an echocardiogram done (or scheduled within the next two weeks). Upon completion of the echocardiogram, you will have successfully completed the study. An echocardiogram is a procedure where a wand is rubbed along your ribcage, under your shirt, to obtain an image of your heart.  The wand has some gel on it that may be cold.  This visit should last 45 minutes to one and a half hours depending on whether the echocardiogram is done at this visit or scheduled to occur at a later visit.  
 
 
Risks and Discomforts  
The following risks/discomforts may occur as a result of your participation in this study: There 
may be minimal pain or discomfort during the inflation of the blood pressure device arm cuffs (as might occur when your doctor takes your blood pressure). This  discomfort is temporary and minor. 
Both the Microlife WatchBP O3 and the Microlife WatchBP Home N blood pressure monitoring devices take measurements while you sleep. This may produce some disturbance of your sleep. You may also experience bruising or ski n irritation from wearing the blood pressure devices.  
 
Questionnaires will include potentially sensitive information concerning possible sources of stress. It is possible that you could feel temporarily upset, tired, or anxious when reporting this informa tion. If you need to talk with someone, we can consult the principal investigator, a 
counselor, social worker, or chaplain. 
 
There may be some slight discomfort when taking a blood sample and you may experience bruising, soreness, and pain at the site of t he needle stick. A trained technician will draw your 
blood and every effort will be made to minimize any discomfort. The risk of infection is minimal, and only sterile materials will be used.  
 There may also be risks that are unknown at this time. You will  be given more information if other 
risks are found. 
 
Benefits  
Every research participant has the opportunity to receive a report with their 24 -hour blood 
pressure recording, lab results, and an echocardiogram. Blood pressure measured on ABPM has 
 
 150 been shown to provide information above and beyond the usual measurements taken in the 
doctor’s office. An echocardiogram provides information on how well your heart pumps your blood to the rest of your body.  This can be used to detect if your heart is not pumping blood as well as it should.  These results will be shared with you and your doctor if you would like. Please initial your choice below to indicate whether you would like us to send you a report describing your study results:  
_____ No, do not mail my blood pressure readings, lab results or echocardiogram 
results to me . 
_____ Yes, I would like a copy of my blood pressure readings, lab results or 
echocardiogram results mailed to me . 
 
_____ No, do not mail my blood pressure readings, lab results or echocardiogram 
results to my doctor. 
_____ Yes, I would like a copy of my blood pressure readings, lab results or 
echocardiogram results mailed to my doctor. 
 
In addition to providing you and your doctor with these results, we hope that this study will provide knowledge to improve cardiovascular outcomes for patients in the future.

 179 Scoring the PSQI  
 
The order of the PSQI items has been modified from the original order in order to fit the first 9 
items (which are the only items that contribute to the total score) on a single page. Item 10, which is the second page of the scale, does not contribute to the PSQI score.  
In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 
(severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.  
Component 1: Subjective sleep quality —question 9 
Response to Q9   Component 1 score

 Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor - Participant Instructions  
How to care for the Ambulatory Blood Pressure 
Monitor  
Remember to keep the Ambulatory Blood Pressure 
Monitor in the dark blue plastic  case (Picture 1) . It 
is important that the monitor does not get wet. We prefer that you do not remove the monitor.  
However, if you will be showering, swimming or exercising, you must remove the monitor.     
How to take the Ambulatory Blood Pressure 
Monitor off  
 When removing the monitor, pull the velcro flap on 
the cuff away from your body and slide the cuff off 
your arm. Gently take the white tube and pull it over your head and away from your body. 
Be careful not to disconnect the white tube 
from the monitor. Lastly,  when taking off the 
monitoring,  remember to put the monitor on 
“Casual mode” by switching it from 
“Ambulatory mode” to “Casual mode”. The 
switch button is on the side of the device 
(Picture 2) .
  
How to put the Ambulatory Blood Pressure 
Monitor back on 
When putting the equipment back on, place the cuff on the same arm you removed the 
equipment from. The cuff should be worn with 
the white tube facing up toward your shoulder 
(Picture 3).  Place the tube around the back of 
your neck and down the front of the opposite 
shoulder. Check to make sure that the arterial 
mark  (the red arrow is pointing to it in Picture 
4) on the cuff is  lying directly on and situated 
over the brachial artery. The research assistant 
marked where your brachial artery is located 
with their finger by  the crease of your elbow  

ID __ __ __ __ __  
200 
 (Picture 4) .  Be sure that the bottom of the cuff 
is situated about one to two inches above the 
crease in your elbow, and that the cuff is snug 
and is equally tight at the top and bottom. 
Check that you are able to place 1 finger easily 
and 2 fingers snugly under  the cuff at the top 
and bottom of the cuff (Picture 5) . Lastly, 
please remember to switch the monitor to 
“Ambulatory mode”. The switch button is on the 
side of the device (see Picture 2).   
 
Frequently Asked Questions about 
the Ambulatory Blood Pressure 
Monitor  
1. What do I do when the monitor is taking a reading? The monitor is going to take a reading every 30 
minutes, both during the day and  at 
night, for example: 5PM, 5:30PM, 6PM, etc. When you feel the cuff inflate, 
please remain motionless, with your 
arm relaxed either gently by your side 
or bent (as if in a sling), or gently resting on a table/desk so that your arm is elevated at 
heart level. We also ask that you do not talk while the monitor is taking a blood pressure 
reading.    
2. How often will the monitor take a reading? The monitor is going to take a reading 
every 30 minutes, both during the day and at night , for example: 5PM, 5:30PM, 6PM, 
etc. There will be a half inflation to notify you that the device will take a reading in one 
minute so that you can prepare yourself for the reading.  
3. What should I do if a reading fails? If a reading fails ( usually because of motion, 
including during driving/riding, or because the arm is not relaxed), the monitor will 

ID __ __ __ __ __  
201 
 attempt to repeat the reading 2 minutes later (shown on the device as 120 seconds). If 
the 2nd attempt fails, the monitor will attempt to repeat the reading 4 minutes later 
(shown on the device as 240 seconds). The monitor will attempt to take a total of 3 
readings . If the 2nd attempt fails, no further attempts will be made until the next 
scheduled reading (30  minutes later). If the readings continue to fail when you are 
motionless and your arm is relaxed, check that the cuff is positioned properly two inches 
above your elbow , with the “artery mark” lying directly on and situated over the brachial 
artery.  If the readings continue to fail, even after you have remained still and have 
positioned the cuff properly, please call us  at (205) 586- 0383.  
4. What should I do if the cuff does not deflate after a reading? In the very unlikely 
event that the cuff inflates and does not deflate properly, you can abort the reading by 
changing the device to “Casual mode” from “Ambulatory mode”  using the switch on the 
device’s right side (see Picture 2) and disconnect ing the white tubing connected to the 
device’s left side . Reconnect the tubing back to the device and take a test -reading in 
“Casual mode.” If the cuff re -inflates and the device is working properly, switch the 
device settings back to “Ambulatory mode” (see Picture 2). If this does not work, please call us at (205)  586-0383. 
5. What should I do if the cuff or monitor gets wet?  There is no personal danger to 
you if the monitor or cuff gets wet. The cuff will be uncomfortable if it gets wet, but there will be no permanent damage. If the monitor gets wet, please wipe it down with a towel. 
If it does not turn on or if it does not take a reading 30 minutes after the monitor got wet, 
please call us  at (205) 586- 0383.

 In Picture 6, the monitor is  worn in a plastic 
case. A strap is attached to both corners of 
the dark blue plastic case and acts as a 
harness for the bag. Picture 6 demonstrates 
the final placement of the monitor if worn in a harness bag.  
Please note that you can place the blood 
press ure cuff, strap holding the monitor,  and 
tubing under neath your shirt          
 
    
 
In Picture 7, the monitor inside the dark blue 
plastic case is worn on a belt. In the back of 
the dark blue plastic case there is a belt loop 
in which the belt can be inserted in to hold 
the monitor . Picture 7  demonstrates this final 
placement of the monitor worn as a belt.  
Please note that you can place the blood 
pressure cuff, plastic case holding the monitor,  and tubing under neath your shirt

 Home Blood Pressure Device - Participant Instructions  
How to care for the Home  Blood Pressure Device  
Remember to keep the Home  Blood Pressure Device 
(Picture 1)  in a safe area, where it does not get 
damaged due to a fall (e.g., not near the corner of the 
bed). It is important that the monitor does not get wet. 
We prefer that you do not remove the cuff during the 
night .  However, if the cuff is causing you pain, you 
may remove it.     
How to take the Home  Blood 
Pressure Cuff off 
When removing the cuff , pull the 
velcro flap on the cuff away from your body and slide the cuff off 
your arm. Gently take the white  tube and pull it away from your body. Be careful not to 
disconnect the white  tube from the monitor. Lastly, remember to put the monitor o n 
“Usual mode” by switching it from “Nocturnal mode” to “Usual mode”. The switch button 
is on the side of the device (Picture 2) . 
How to put the Home  Blood Pressure Cuff  on  
When going to bed put the blood pressure cuff  
on. You should place it  on the same arm you 
removed the equipment from  during your Visit . 
The cuff should be worn with the white  tube 
facing down toward your elbow/hand (Picture 3) . 
Check to make sure that the arterial mark  on the 
cuff is lying directly on and situated over the 
brachial artery. The research assistant marked 
where your brachial artery is located with a red 
arrow (Picture 4) . Be sure that the bottom of the 
cuff is situated about one to two inches above the 
crease in your elbow, and that the cuff is snug 

ID __ __ __ __ __  
204 
 and is equally tight at the top and bottom. Check that 
you are able to place 1 finger easily and 2 fingers 
snugly under the cuff (both at the top and bottom) 
(Picture 5) .  
Take your first test reading on Nocturnal mode by 
pressing the on/off button for three seconds when 
you are going to lie in bed and about to go to 
sleep. It will take your first blood pressure reading 
immedia tely. If you cannot get a valid reading, check 
if the cuff is too loose, if there is a kink in the tubing, or the tubing is not securely connected to the home 
blood pressure device, then retry the reading. Once 
you get a valid reading,  place the device under your 
pillow or on somewhere on your bed in a safe area where it will not fall or cause the device damage. The 
monitor will take 3 readings at 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 
hours after your first test reading.
  
Frequently Asked Questions about the Home  
Blood Pressure Device  
1. What do I do when the device is taking a 
reading? The device will be taking three readings 
while you are sleeping. Make sure before you go to 
sleep that the tubing is not compressed or obstructed 
and that you do not sleep on the arm where the cuff is placed. If you feel the cuff inflate and wake up,  
please remain motionless  and do not talk while the 
monitor is taking a blood pressure reading.    
2. How often will the device take a reading? After 
your first test reading, the monitor is going to take a 
total of three readings, two hours, three hours, and 
four hours later. For example, if you take your test 
reading at 10:30PM, the monitor will take one reading 
at 12:30AM, 1:30AM and 2:30AM.   
3. What should I do if a reading fails? If a reading 
fails (usually because of motion,  the tube being obstructed, or the cuff not being 
properly placed), the monitor will  NOT  attempt to repeat the reading. If you happen to 
wake up and realize there is an error reading, please adjust the cuff and ch eck that the 

ID __ __ __ __ __  
205 
 cuff is positioned properly two inches above your elbow with the arrow pointing to your 
brachial artery. If the readings continue to fail,  and you are aware of such even after you 
have remained still and have positioned the cuff properly, please call us  at (205) 586-
0383 in the morning.  
5. What should I do if the device or cuff gets wet?  Please try to keep the monitor 
dry. There is no personal danger to you if the monitor or cuff gets wet. The cuff will be 
uncomfortable if it gets wet, but there will be no permanent damage. If the monitor gets wet, please wipe it down with a towel. If it does not turn on or if it does not take a test reading after the monitor gets  wet, please call us  at (205) 586- 0383.

 ABPM Results Guide  
 
We appreciate you taking time to participate in the Better BP  study. In this study, we recorded your 
blood pressure every 30 minutes for as long as you wore the ambulatory blood pressure monitor  
(ABPM).  Attached is a report that details your results.   
Here is a guide to your ABPM report:  
Top Left Panel  
• W e provide your personal information, the day and night time period as set by the ABPM device 
software, and the awake and asleep times you reported on your ABPM device log. 
• The last box in the top left panel is the level (threshold) for defining high daytime and nighttime 
blood pressure by national hypertension guidelines.  
Graph of Blood Pressure Values 
• The top red line is your systolic blood pressure (i.e., top number of the blood pressure), the 
bottom red line is your diastolic  blood pressure (i.e., bottom number of your blood pressure) , 
and the gray line at the bottom of the graph is your heart rate (HR) . These are the values taken 
over the course of the day from when you put on to when you took off the blood pressure cuff.  
The blue box represents the nighttime period as set by the ABPM device software.  
 
Middle Box  
• This box contains your average blood pressure values  and heart rate for 24-hours, awake 
readings, and asleep readings . 
• Everyone’s blood pressure varies between measurements. SD stands for standard deviation 
and this number represents how much your blood pressure varied throughout the period when it 
was being measured. 
 
Here is how to interpret your readings: 
Based on 2017 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, 
high average blood pressure on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is defined by: 
High 24 -hour blood pressure  Systolic (sys) blood pressure greater than or equal to 125 mm  Hg or 
diastolic (dia) blood pressure greater than or equal to 75 mm  Hg 
This is based on blood pressure readings taken over the entire period that you wore the device. 
High awake  blood pressure  Systolic (sys) blood pressure greater than or equal to 130 mm  Hg or 
diastolic (dia) blood pressure greater than or equal to 80 mm  Hg 
This is based on blood pressure readings taken during the period that you were awake. 
High asleep  blood pressure  Systolic (sys) blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm  Hg or 
diastolic (dia) blood pressure greater than or equal to 65 mm  Hg 
This is based on blood pressure readings taken during the period that you were asleep. 
Bottom of the page, we provide all of the individual blood pressure readings that were obtained for 
you, the time they were taken and your heart rate. The readings in red represent blood pressure 
values that were greater than the pre-defined blood pressure level (threshold) shown in the last box in the top left panel.  You shouldn’t worry if a few readings were high as blood pressure varies from beat 
to beat. 
Analysis Plan : Evaluating novel approaches for estimating awake and sleep blood pressure (The Better BP 
Study) 
 
Aims and hypotheses  
Primary Aim 1 : To examine whether measuring unattended clinic BP with an automated device will provide a 
more accurate estimate of awake BP on ABPM than measuring attended clinic BP with an automated device.  
Hypothesis 1a: The absolute difference with awake BP will be smaller for unattended vs. attended clinic BP.  
Hypothesis 1b : The agreement between hypertension status using BP measured in the clinic and on ABPM 
while awake will be higher when clinic BP is measured unattended vs. attended. Also, the prevalence of both 
white coat and masked hypertension will be lower when measuring unattended clinic BP.  
 Primary Aim 2 : To examine whether a new HBPM device provides an accurate approach for measuring sleep 
BP.  Hypothesis 2a: Sleep BP on HBPM will provide an accurate estimate of sleep BP on ABPM.  
Hypothesis 2b : HBPM will be better tolerated (e.g., less awakening during sleep, pain, bruising) than ABPM.  
 Primary Aim 3 : To compare the associations of unattended versus attending clinic BP, unattended clinic BP 
versus awake BP on ABPM, and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with two markers of end- organ damage, left 
ventricular mass index (LVMI) and urinary albumin- to-creatinine ratio (ACR).  
Hypothesis 3a: The association with end-organ damage will be stronger for unattended vs. attended clinic BP.  Hypothesis 3b : The association with end -organ damage will be similar for unattended clinic BP and awake BP.  
Hypothesis 3c : The association with end-organ damage will be similar for sleep BP by HBPM and ABPM. 
 Objectives : 
1. Determine the  absolute mean difference in  awake systolic and diastolic BP, separately,  between attended  
and unattended BP ; awake BP from ABPM  and attended BP ; and awake BP from ABPM  and unattended 
BP.  
2. Determine the prevalence of hypertensio n, white coat hypertension, and masked hypertension on attended, 
unattended, and ABPM BP measurements.   
3. Determine the agreement between hypertension phenotypes on ABPM and clinic BP (i.e., attended and 
unattended). 
4. Determine the absolute mean difference in asleep systolic and diastolic BP, separately, between asleep BP measurements from ABPM  and HBPM .  
5. Determine the tolerability of ABPM and HBPM.  
6. Determine the associations of unattended versus attending clinic BP, unattended clinic BP versus awake BP 
on ABPM, and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio (ACR).  
  The following  will be conducted using data from the Better BP study. 
 
Data management :  
Create the following variables to define hypertension:  1. Create the variable ABPM_HYPER  by assigning 1 to those with mean a wake ABPM  ≥135 mm Hg (systolic 
BP) or 85 mm H g (diastolic BP) and 0 if otherwise.  
2. Create the variable ATTENDED_HYPER  by assigning 1 to those with mean attended BP ≥1 40 mm Hg 
(systolic BP) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic BP) and 0 if otherwise.  
3. Create the variable UNATTENDED_HYPER  by assigning 1 to those with mean unattended BP ≥ 135 mm 
Hg (systolic BP) or 85 mm Hg (diastolic BP) and 0 if otherwise.  
4. Identify  the following individuals: 
1. HYP_AB_AT TEND should equal 1  if ABPM_HYPER  = 1 and ATTENDED_HYPER  = 1, and 0 if 
otherwise.  
2. HYP_AB_UNATTEND should equal 1 if ABPM_HYPER  = 1 and UNATTENDED_HYPER  = 1, 
and 0 if otherwise .  
3. WHIT_AB_ATTEN D should equal 1 if ABPM_HYPER = 0 and ATTENDED_HYPER = 1, and 0 
if otherwise.  
4. WHIT_AB_ UNATTEND should equal 1 if ABPM_HYPER = 0 and UNATTENDED_HYPER = 1, 
and 0 if otherwise. 
5. MASK_AB_ATTEN D should equal 1 if ABPM_HYPER = 1 and ATTENDED_HYPER = 0, and 0 
if otherwise.  
6. MASK_AB_UNATTEND should equal 1 if ABPM_HYPER = 1 and UNATTENDED_HYPER = 0, 
and 0 if otherwise. 
 
 Statistical analysis :  
 1. Calculate the dis tribution of the variables in Table 1 , overall, and separately for participants who were 
attended then unattended, unattended then attended, as well as participants who underwent ABPM before HBPM , and HBPM before ABPM.  
 
2. Do the following analysis for Table 2  for those with complete BP data on ABPM, attended, and unattended:  
a. For awake systolic BP, calculate the mean (with standard deviation) BP on ABPM, attended, and unattended  
b. Calculate the absolute mean difference with 95% confidence intervals for ABPM vs. attended, ABPM vs. unattended, and attended vs. unattended, using mixed model to determine the difference between the differences.  
c. Repeat items 2a and 2b  for awake diastolic BP  on ABPM, attended and unattended.  
 
3. Do the following analysis for Table 3  for those with complete BP data on ABPM, attended, and unattended:  
a. Calculate the percentage (with 95% confidence interval) of participants with hypertension on awake 
ABPM (i.e., ABPM_HYPER  = 1)  
b. Calculate the percentage (with 95% confidence interval) of participants with hypertension on attended BP measurements (i.e., ATTENDED_HYPER  = 1).  
c. Calculate the percentage (with 95% confidence interval) of participants with hypertension on unattended BP measurements (i.e., UN ATTENDED_HYPER  = 1).  
d. Calculate the percentage (with 95% confidence intervals) of participants with hypertension on attended and awake ABPM (i.e.,  HYP_AB_ATTEND = 1).  
e. Calculate the percentage (with 95% confidence intervals) of participants with hypertension on unattended and awake ABPM (i.e., HYP_AB_UNATTEND  = 1).  
f. Calculate the percentage (with 95% confidence intervals) of part icipants with  white coat 
hypertension on ABPM and attended BP (i.e., WHIT_AB_ATTEND  = 1). 
g. Calculate the percentage (with 95% conf idence intervals ) of participants with  white coat

The standard approach to measuring blood pressure (BP), in the clinic with an observer present (attended BP 
measurement) , results in the misdiagnosis of hypertension for many adults .1 Among adults with high BP in the 
clinic (systolic BP [ SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP]  ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) , ~20% to 30% do not have high BP (SBP /DBP 
<135/ 85 mm Hg) while awake outside of the clinic, a phenotype called white coat hypertension.2  White  coat 
hypertension is not associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.3, 4 Also , 15% to 30% of 
people without high BP (SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg) when measured by an observer in the clinic have high BP 
6%3'%3 ≥155 mm Hg ZhLOH aZaNH RXtVLGH RI thH FOLnLF5, 6  This phenotype, called masked hypertension, 
is associated with high CVD risk.5, 7  Due to the high degree of misclassification of hypertension when using  
clinic BP, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends out-of-clinic BP measurement be performed to 
exclude the presence of white coat hypertension before initiating antihypertensive treatment.2   
 
Data from  non-randomized  studies from Canada suggest that using an automated oscillometric BP (AOBP) 
device without an observer present (unattended BP) results in lower clinic BP compared to attended 
measurements  taken using the auscultatory method .8, 9  The 2017 Canadian hypertension guideline 
recommended measuring unattended BP in clinical practice for reducing the risk of white coat hypertension but 
acknowledged the low level of evidence supporting this recommendation ( i.e., Grade D, “very low quality” and 
“expert opinion”).10 Currently, obtaining unattended BP has not been adopted in US guidelines. Few studies 
have compared unattended clinic BP to attended clinic BP measured with an oscilometric device, which is 
increasingly being used for measuring BP in the US. In an analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention 
Trial (SPRINT) data, there was no difference in BP when measured unattended and attended (personal 
communication , S. Oparil ). Thus, there is  equipoise as to whether  unattended BP reduces the risk of white  coat 
hypertension . Further, the  effect of unattended BP measurement on masked hypertension risk is also unclear. 
 
Nocturnal hypertension, t\SLFaOO\ GHILnHG E\ mHan VOHHS 6%3'%3 ≥ 100 mm Hg affects ~1 in 3 adults  and 
is associated with increased CVD risk, independent of clinic and awake BP.11-13 Therefore, a comprehensive 
approach to diagnos ing hypertension requires measuring sleep BP in addition to awake BP . Ambulatory BP 
monitoring (ABPM) is a procedure wherein people have their BP measured automatically every 15 to 30 
minutes, typically for 24 hours, outside of the clinic setting .  ABPM is widely considered to be the reference 
standard for diagnosing hypertension. However, ABPM  is not available in most clinics in the US and is poorly 
tolerated by patients.14-16 Recently, home BP monitoring (HBPM) devices have been developed that measure 
BP during sleep. These devices may be better tolerated than ABPM as they are only worn at night and fewer 
BP measurements are obtained. We propose  to compar e novel non -ABPM approaches for measuring BP 
and diagnosing hypertension with ABPM, the reference standard .2  The study aims are: 
 
Aim 1. Test whether measuring unattended clinic BP with an automated device will provide a more 
accurate estimate of awake BP on ABPM than measuring attended clinic BP with an automated device.  
Hypothesis 1a: The absolute difference with awake BP will be smaller for unattended vs. attended clinic BP. 
Hypothesis 1b: The agreement between hypertension status using BP measured in the clinic and on ABPM 
while awake will be higher when clinic BP is measured unattended versus attended .  Also, the prevalence of 
both white  coat and masked hypertension will be lower when measuring unattended versus attended clinic BP.  
Aim 2. Test whe ther a new HBPM device provides an accurate approach for measuring sleep BP .   
Hypothesis 2a: Sleep BP on HBPM will provide an accurate estimate of sleep BP on ABPM .   
Hypothesis 2b: HBPM will be better tolerated (e.g., less awakening during sleep , pain, bruising) than ABPM.  
 
Aim 3. Compare the associations of unattended versus attended clinic BP , unattended clinic BP versus 
awake BP on ABPM,  and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with two markers of end -organ damage, left 
ventricular mass index ( LVMI ) and urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio (ACR).  
Hypothesis 3a: The association with end-organ damage will be stronger for unattended vs. attended clinic BP. 
Hypothesis 3b: The association with end- organ damage will be similar for unattended clinic BP and awake BP. 
Hypothesis 3c: The association with end- organ damage will be similar for sleep BP by HBPM and ABPM. 
 
We will enroll 630 adults , not taking antihypertensive medication, with screening clinic SBP of 110 to 159 mm 
Hg and DBP of 70 to 99 mm Hg in New York,  NY and Birmingham, AL. Participants will undergo unattended 
and attended clinic BP measurements , in a random order, and 24-hour ABPM and sleep HBPM, in a random 
order.  Health behaviors, psychosocial factors, anthropometrics , LVMI , and ACR  will also be as sessed.  
 
Public Health Significance:  This study will help determine whether the conduct of unattended BP 
measurement in the clinic can reduce the need for measur ing awake BP  on ABPM , and also test whether a 
HBPM device can replace ABPM  for measuring sleep BP. These data will inform whether these novel non-
ABPM approaches for measur ing BP and diagnos ing hypertension should be used in clinic practice.      Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul

B. SIGNIFICANCE . The significance of the proposed study is summarized in Table 1.  
B.1. Clinic BP as a CVD risk factor. 
Compared with other risk factors, elevated 
BP is associated with more CVD events and disability -adjusted life years lost in the US 
and worldwide.
17, 18 To identify patients with 
hypertension and monitor their BP while 
taking antihypertensive medication, most 
US guidelines and scientific statements 
recommend BP be measured in the clinic 
setting by a trained healthcare 
professional .19-21  This recommendation is 
supported by extensive data, demonstrat ing 
that elevated BP, measured using this 
approach, is associated with increased risk 
for CVD and renal disease events.22, 23 In 
clinical practice and research studies 
conducted in the US, BP is almost 
universally measured in the clinic with an 
observer present (attended clinic BP). 
B.2. Measuring BP outside of the clinic. 
Several studies have found that compared 
with attended clinic BP, BP measured 
outside of the clinic is a better predictor  of a 
person’s CVD risk.4, 24 The US Preventive 
Services Task Force (USPSTF)  and the UK 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend that elevated BP measured in the clinic be confirmed by out -
of-clinic BP measurement s prior to 
diagnosing hypertension.
2, 25 ABPM is the 
reference standard  for out-of-clinic BP 
assessment and making the diagnosis of  
hypertension.4, 26, 27  ABPM monitors are compact, worn on a belt or in a pouch, and connected to a BP cuff on 
the upper arm by a tube. The monitors are programmed to obtain readings using the oscillometric method , 
every 15 to 30 minutes, typically for 24 hours, throughout the day and night.  
B.3. Mismatch between clinic and out-of-clinic BP. In some people, there is a transient BP increase that 
occurs in the clinic setting (i.e., white coat effect).28, 29 For others, BP is lower in the clinic when compared to 
measurements obtained outside of the clinic environment (i.e., masked effect).7, 30  White  coat hypertension  is 
defined as hypertension based on clinic -mHaVXUHG %3 ≥ 1400 mm Hg EXt nRt ZhHn mHaVXUHG RXtVLGH RI 
the clinic setting (awake BP < 135/85 mm Hg) . In most ABPM studies, white  coat hypertension  has not been 
associated with increased CVD risk.3, 31 In contrast, masked hypertension, defined as not having hypertension 
based on BP measured in the clinic setting (< 140/90 mm Hg) but hypertension based on out -of-clinic

Assessing sleep BP may be particularly important for African Americans, a population with high CVD risk and 
approximately two times higher prevalence of nocturnal hypertension compared with whites.40-42 In the Jackson 
Heart Study  (JHS), a cohort comprised exclusively of African Americans, 60% of participants had nocturnal 
hypertension and the multivar iable -adjusted hazard ratio for CVD events was 1.84 (95% CI: 1.00, 3.38) 
comparing participants with and without nocturnal hypertension.  Also, a high percentage of African Americans 
with nocturnal hypertension do not have hypertension based on clinic BP o r awake BP on ABPM (Figure 1).41, Table 1. Significance of the proposed study.  
 BP, measured by an observer in the clinic, does not provide an 
accurate estimate of a person’s true BP and hypertension status.  
• Out-of-clinic BP assessment by ABPM is widely recommended to:  
• Identify white  coat hypetension and masked hypertesion.  
• Identify hypertension during sleep.  
• Many clin ics in the US do not have access to ABPM.  
• Many patients do not tolerate ABPM.  
• It has been suggested that  ABPM can be replaced by BP measured 
in the clinic using an automated device without an observer 
present.  
Prior studies of BP measurement with automated devices without 
an observer present have major limitations.  
• The order of BP measurement (observed or unobserved occurring 
first) was not randomized.  
• Observer measured BP was most commonly performed using a 
mercury sphygmometer, which is no longer the reco mmended 
approach for measuring BP in clinic practice.  
• Select patients with high BP or treated hypertension were enrolled.  
Studies of sleep BP using HBPM vs. ABPM have major limitations.  
• Sleep BP is associated with sub -clinical and clinical CVD events.  
• The ordering of HBPM and ABPM was not randomized.  
• Studies have focused on patients on antihypertensive medication.  
• No data are available in the US including among African Americans, who have a high prevalence of nocturnal hypertension.  
Potential solutions to be tested in the proposed study:  
• Measuring clinic BP without an observer to assess awake BP.  
• Will this reduce the need to screen for white  coat hypertension ?
 
• What is the effect of this approach on masked hypertension?  
• Using a novel HBPM device to measure asleep BP.  
• Does this accurately assess sleep BP / nocturnal hypertension?  
• Is HBPM better tolerated than ABPM in assessing sleep BP?  Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul
Research Strategy                                                                                              Page 74
43 Until recently , ABPM has been the only method that could assess sleep BP  (Section B.6.2.1.) .   
B.5. Challenges with ABPM.  The misdiagnosis of hypertension when BP is measured by an observer in the 
clinic versus by ABPM is well recognized  by guidelines, scientific statements, and position papers .1, 24  
However, there are several challenges that have prevented the 
wide-spread use of ABPM in clinical practice.  
B.5.1. Health care provider  perspective. Recently , we conducted 
a nominal groups  study, a qualitative research approach, with 40 
physicians in Alabama and New York to identify barriers to 
performing ABPM.44 Reported barriers included need for staff 
training, time con straints in patient preparation, and lack of 
infrastructure and inaccessibility of equipment and specialists to 
whom providers could refer their patients for the ABPM procedure.15 
Also, ABPM devices cost over $2,000 each , insurance companies 
do not commonly reimburse for indications other than white coat 
hypertension, and when reimbursed, the compensation is low.14, 45  
B.5.2. Patient perspective. Low patient tolerability for ABPM has 
been reported in previous studies.16, 46, 47  For example, in one study, 
side effects associated with ABPM ranged from 7% for bruising to 
70% for the device awakening the participant during sleep.16  
B.6. New approaches for diagnosing hypertension. Given the real world limitations of ABPM, novel 
approaches are needed for measuring awake and sleep BP .  
B.6.1. New approach for assessing awake BP. An emerging method  that has been proposed for estimating 
awake BP is to measure BP in the clinic using a fully automated oscillometric device (AOBP) without an 
observer being present (unattended clinic BP measurement).  
 B.6.1.1. AOBP . There are currently two validated oscillometric devices available in the US (Omron HEM-
907XL and Microlife’s Watch BP office ) that can be programmed to measure BP automatically without an  
observer being present.48-50  Using these devices, the technician or healthcare provider leaves the room  after a 
person has a BP cuff placed on their arm and they are positioned for measurements . After a minute rest, t he 
device inflates the cuff and BP is measured.  AOBP devices can obtain several  BP measurements at preset  
(e.g., one minute) intervals.  The maker of BPTru, a third device, went out of business in 2017.   
 B.6.1.2. Can unattended clinic BP measurements replace the need for assessing awake BP on ABPM?  
Canadian studies suggest that patients with hypertension have lower un attended BP compared with attended 
BP.8, 9, 51 -53  Therefore, the use of unattended clinic BP may result in a lower prevalence of white  coat 
hypertension.  In a pooled analysis  of 8558 adults, the mean clinic BP was 10/7 mm Hg lower with unattended 
AOBP versus BP recorded by a provider in clinical practice by auscultation  and a mercury sphygmometer.54 In 
the only randomized study of AOBP published to date, the difference between BP when measured observed 
and unobserved was small  (< 5 mm Hg ).8 In 2017, the Hypertension Canada guideline recommended 
unattended BP (i.e., AOBP) as the preferred method of clinic BP measurement.10  However, this 
recommendation was based on a Grade D level of evidence (i.e. quality of evidence is very low, based on expert opinion, no direct research evidence, and studies had ver y severe limitations). US guidelines do not 
currently recommend AOBP for use in clinic practice.   Recently , in a post -hoc analysis of SPRINT  data, there 
was no difference in clinic BP between sites  that measured it  unattended versus attended (manuscript under 
review at Hypertension , personal communication, S. Oparil ). At each visit, SPRINT participiants  did not have 
both unattended and attended BP measurements ; there was no randomization; information about the conduct 
of unattended or attended BP measurements was obtained retrospec tively after study end; and no comparison 
to ABPM was made. Table 2 summarizes  the major limitations of published studies on AOBP. There  is 
currently  equipoise as to whether unattended clinic BP provides an accurate estimate of awake BP on ABPM.  
B.6.1.3. Can u nattended BP be successfully implemented in clinical practice?   Two issues have been 
raised as barriers to implementing AOBP in clinical practice : the time it takes to perform this procedure and the 
need for dedicated space. Although AOBP takes longer than unstandardized  clinic BP measurement (clinic BP 
taken without following guideline-recommended approaches), AOBP takes a shorter amount of time t han clinic 
BP measurements taken following American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations .52 Further, 
unstandardized clinic BP measurements are very common in clinical practice, generate poor estim ates of BP, 
and interventions targeted at observers to obtain standardized clinic BP have been largely unsuccessful.55 
Having a dedicated room to perform unattended BP has been reported as a barrier to AOBP. However, if clinic 
space is not available, unattended AOBP can be successfully performed while a patient is in a waiting room.56  3%14%

 B.6.2. New approach for assessing sleep BP. Recently, home BP monitors (HBPM) have been adapted to 
measure a sleep BP.  As described below, there are compelling preliminary data supporting this approach . 
B.6.2.1. A novel HBPM device for measuring sleep BP. Until recently, sleep BP could only be assessed by 
ABPM.  HBPM devices have been developed that measure BP  automatically  during sleep.  These devices 
have been previously validated  for accuracy .49, 58 Before going to sleep, a person attaches a BP cuff to their 
arm and turns on the HBPM device, which is programmed to take BP measurements while the person is 
asleep. In a prior study conducted in Japan, an HBPM device (Omron HEM-5001) was programmed to obtain 
BP measurements at 2am, 3am and 4am.59 Given that only three readings are obtained during the sleep 
period and that a prior study demonstrated the feasibility for measuring sleep BP, there is great potential for 
using these HBPM devices for accurately measuring sleep BP with less burden than ABPM. Table 3 shows the 
major limitations of published studies using HBPM to assess sleep BP.  In the current study, we will test 
whether HBPM  is an accurate and better tolerated approach for measuring sleep BP  than ABPM .59   
 C. INNOVATION . The proposed study has several innovative features : 
• We will enroll patients with a wide range of clinic BP  and who are not taking antihypertensive medication.  
The study examines  unattended clinic BP measurement for the diagnosis of hypertension.  
• The study will use a within-subjects randomized design which will control for order effects and regression to the mean. Participants will be randomized to have their BP measured in the c linic attended or unattended 
in counterbalanced order (i.e. attended followed by unattended or vice versa).  Additionally, participants will be randomized to have their sleep BP measured first by ABPM then by HBPM or vice -versa. The lack of 
randomized cont rolled data  on BP measured unattended versus attended  has resulted in a low grade of 
evidence (Grade D) in the Canadian hypertension guideline.   
• The study will compare unattended clinic BP versus attended clinic BP using the same  oscillometric device. 
In prior studies, attended clinic BP was measured by auscultation. The use of oscillometric BP devices is 
becoming more widespread in clinical practice  as mercury sphygmomanometers have environmental 
concerns and the need for frequent calibration  of aneroi d devices is recognized as a major problem.  
• We will test whether BP during sleep can be accurately  measured using a n HBPM device  and whether this 
device is better tolerated  than ABPM. To our knowledge this HPBM device has not been tested in the US 
and there are no data on sleep BP from HBPM for race/ethnicity groups (i.e. African Americans  or 
Hispanics). The study will enroll a multi -ethnic sample of white, African American and Hispanic participants 
in the Northeast and Southeast US, which will increase the generalizability of the results.  
• We will determine the prevalence of both white  coat hypertension and masked hypertension using Table 2. Limitations of published stud ies comparing attended and unattended BP versus awake BP on ABPM  
1. The order of clinic BP measurement (attended and unattended clinic BP) was not randomized.  In prior studies, unattended 
clinic BP was performed after attended clinic BP. Thus, order effects  cannot be excluded.  
2. Attended clinic BP was not measured in a standardized way (guideline recommendations) . The difference in unattended 
and attended BP could be explained by poor measurement techniques when obtaining attended BP.  
3. Attended clinic BP was  measured by auscultation using a mercury sphygmometer . In the US, this method is no  longer 
performed , and oscillometric devices have become a common method for BP measurement in practice.  
4. Enrollment was restricted to patients with high clinic BP.  Enrollment of patients with only high clinic BP makes it impossible 
to separate the effect of unattended clinic BP measurements from regression to the mean.  Few data are available comparing 
unattended and attended clinic BP among adults with normal clinic BP or prehypertension.  
5. Patients often were taking antihypertensive medication . The role of unattended clinic BP measurement for the initial 
diagnosis of hypertension (which is the focus on the proposed study) remains unclear.  
6. Studies have focused on the diagnosis of white  coat hypertension. Scarce data are available from studies evaluating the 
effect of measuring unattended BP on masked hypertension.  An unintended consequence of unattended BP is that it may 
increase the prevalence of masked hypertension as individuals who would have previously been identified as having sustained 
hypertension (elevated clinic BP and awake BP on ABPM) will now have masked hypertension because clinic BP is no longer 
elevated.57 However, if unattended clinic BP measurement provides an accurate estimate of awake BP on ABPM, then the 
prevalence of masked hypertension should decrease.  
Table 3. Limitations of prior studies comparing sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM  
1. The order of home monitoring and ABPM to assess sleep BP was not randomized. In prior studies, patients chose the order 
in which they completed home monitoring and ABPM to assess sleep BP.  
2. Studies did not include US populations . Sleep BP and nocturnal hypertension have not been compared between HBPM and 
ABPM in African Americans, a population with a high prevalence of nocturnal hypertension.  
3. Over 80% of patients were taking antihypertensive medication . Prior studies  have primarily included people taking 
antihypertensive medication, with some people taking medication before bedtime. The role of home monitoring to assess sleep 
BP has not been evaluated among people not taking antihypertensive medication.  
4. The agree ment of nocturnal hypertension defined using HBPM versus ABPM was not reported.  Prior studies have only 
reported the correlation and mean difference in sleep BP levels on HBPM and ABPM.  
5. The tolerability of assessing sleep BP on HBPM was not assessed. Sleep HBPM may be better tolerated than ABPM.  Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul

• W e will determine the predictive value of unattended clinic BP by compar ing its association  with LVMI  and 
ACR, two validated measures of hypertension-related end -organ damage, versus the association s of 
attended clinic BP and awake BP on ABPM with these end- organ damage measures.

D. APPROACH. 
D.1. Overall strategy of proposed study.  This study consists of two  
parallel cross-over randomized controlled trial s conducted in the same 
participants . A schematic showing the study design is provided in 
Figure 2 . We will recruit 630 community -dwelling participants  from 
centers  in Birmingham, AL and New York, NY  (n=315 at each site). We 
will enroll a population with a sufficient number of whites, African 
Americans , and Hispanic s to investigate differences in BP 
measurement techniques by race/ethnicity . Also , information on 
tolerability of the ABPM and HBPM devices will be collected, and a brief 
examination  and an echocardiogram, will be conducted. A random spot  
urine sample will be collected to measure the ACR.  
D.2. Proposed Timeline . Funding for the study is being requested for 
four years ( July 1, 2018 to June  30, 2022).  During the first six months, 
we will  finaliz e the study protocol , develop the randomization 
assignment and study databases,  and conduct staff training.  From 
January 2019 through December 2021, we will enroll 630  participants 
(n=105  participants per site annually ) and conduct study visits.  The 
preparation of data for analysis, including clinic BP, ABPM and sleep 
BP on HBPM, will be conducted throughout  the study , and the final six 
months ( January through June 2022 ) will be dedicated to analyses and 
preparation of manuscripts and presentations.  
D.3. Feasibility of conducting the proposed study at two sites. 
Drs. Muntner and Shimbo (co-PIs) have collaborated for  10 years . Their strong collaboration is demonstrated 
by co-funded grants and over 8 0 published papers including many  related to BP measurement . Studies with 
primary data collection have included 888 participants enrolled in the Masked Hypertension (MHT) Study and 
408 participants enrolled in the Improving the Detection of Hypertension (I DH) Study, which are both part of a 
NIH/NHLBI Program Project. Dr. Shimbo was responsible for successfully leading the echocardiography core 
laboratory for the assessment of LVMI in the MHT Study and IDH Study. In the AHA  Strategically Focused 
Research Network (AHA-SFRN) center on hypertension , they conducted  clinic BP measurements and ABPM 
in 835 participants  over a 12-month period . Additional d etails of the investigators’ experience is provided in 
their biosketches. Over all, the proposed study is highly feasible.  
D.4. Recruitment . We will enroll a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 630  adults  (50% men; 50% women ) 
who are ≥  19 years of age . We will  identify participants from patients visiting their physician for outpatient care 
at UAB or Columbia University. BP is measured at all outpatient visits at both institutions . We will query  the 
I2B2 data warehouse at UAB and the CUMC data warehouse at Columbia University on a weekly basis and 
extract BP, medical history regarding the exclusion criteria,  and pharmacy/medication data from electronic 
clinic health records.   We will obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) and HIPAA waiver approval s for the 
search .  With the permission of the physician  who conducted the clinic visit, we will be able to contact 
individual patients directly, briefly describe the study, and determine their  interest in participating . People who 
are interested will be administered a brief telephone questionnaire to confirm their eligibility. Those wh o 
continue to be  eligible will be invited to attend a screening visit and , if eligible, they will initiate the study.  
D.4.1. Eligibility criteria. To increase the  generalizability  of the study, a limited number of exclusion criteria 
are being applied. Inclusion criteria are : 
• $gH ≥ 19 years  and ability to speak English or Spanish . 
• Mean screening SBP of 110 to < 160 mm Hg and  mean  screening DBP of 70 to <100 mm Hg  based on the 
two most recent outpatient  clinic visits , extracted from clinical records . As people with clinic SBP < 110 mm 
Hg and DBP < 70 mm Hg are very unlikely to have masked hypertension, we will not include these 
participants in our study.60, 61  Also, people with clinic 6%3 ≥ 10 mm Hg RU '%3 ≥ 100 mm Hg are typically 
referred for additional  BP management  with a high percentage initiated on antihypertensive medication .   Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul
Research Strategy                                                                                              Page 77
Exclusion criteri a are: 
• Lack of willingness to provide  written informed  consent .  
• Use of antihypertensive or other medications that substantially affect BP  (e.g., NSAIDS, steroids). 
• History of CVD or major arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia).  
• Individuals who work second shift or overnight, as diurnal BP patterns may be different for this group, or 
with jobs that will not allow the ABPM device to measure BP  every 30 minutes (e.g., truck drivers) .  
• History of sleep apnea by self -report, identified in their clinic records , and/or a score ≥ 3 on the STOP-
BANG questionnaire. The sensitivity of a STOP -BANG score ≥ 3 for identifying sleep apnea is 90%.  
• Orthostatic hypotension assessed during the screening visit (Section D.5). Mean awake BP  on ABPM may 
be affected by hypotensive episodes during standing or walking. 
• Pregnancy  (as no ABPM devices have been validated in pregnant women).  
Although there is no estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) exclusion criteria, we anticipa te the prevalence 
of an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 will be low.  Only 3% of US adults not taking antihypertensive medication in 
NHANES 2011-2014 had an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. We will adjust for eGFR in multivariable analyses.  
D.4.2 . Recruitment by race-ethnicity . Nighttime BP differs substantially by race/ethnicity .41, 42 We will not 
exclude people on the basis of race/ethnicity. To provide statistical power to detect differences in the validity of 
study results by race -ethnicity, we will recruit at least 16 0 white, 16 0 African American and 16 0 Hispanic 
participants . In a preliminary query of the I2B2 database, there were over 50,000 whites, 40,000 African 
Americans and 3,000 Hispanics who met the eligibility criteria at UAB in 2016. At Columbia, over 550 African 
Americ ans and 900 Hispanics have been enrolled in our recent studies of ABPM and HBPM.  
D.4.3. Recruitment by BP levels . To ensure a broad range of clinic BP values for the current study, we will 
UHFUXLt 50 RI RXU VamSOH tR haYH 6%3 ≥ 140 mm Hg RU '%3 ≥ 0 mm Hg  based on the average of the most  
 recent two  clinic visits  in their medical record . 
D.5. Screening visit.  Participants will have BP measured three times in 
each arm  (as recommended by AHA guidelines)  to determine which 
arm (one with higher mean BP) to use for assessing clinic BP and to 
confirm participants do not have orthostatic hypotension.  The arm with 
the higher BP will be used for all BP measurement s obtained during the 
study . For assessment of orthostatic hypotension, additional readings 
will be obtained after the participant has been supine for at least 5 
minutes and after both 1 and 3 minutes of standing.62 Orthostatic 
hypotension will be defined as a maximum decline in SBP from supine 
to standing ≥ 20 mmHg.  We will use the STOP -BANG Questionnaire to assess the probability of having sleep 
apnea.63 Those with a STOP -BANG score ≥ 3 will be cons idered to have a high probability of sleep apnea and 
excluded from enrollment.  
D.6. Study visits. After obtaining consent , the protocol involves eight domains  of data collection (Table 4). 
Data will be collected over one to two week s during  four study visits  (Figure 3 ). The protocol  is similar in 
complexity to ones we have implemented  in the IDH and MHT studies  and the AHA -SFRN .64-66  
D.6.1. Study Visit 1. Study staff will log onto the secure HIPAA-complia nt study website  to enter the 
participant’s eligibility information and receive their randomization assignment for ordering of clinic BP  
measurement (i.e.,  randomization 1 in Figure 2 ).  Section D.10.1 has descriptions of the study database and 
website. Clinic BP will be measured unattended and then attended or attended then unattended with the order  
determined by the randomization assignment (see Section D.7).  Next , participants will complete a brief 
physical examination and questionnaires on health behaviors, psychosocial factors, and sleep.  This 
examination will include anthropometrics  and fasting blood and urine specimen collection.  
D.6.2. Study Visit 2.  The second study visit will occur the day after  the first visit. Dur ing the second study visit, 
participants will have their clinic BP measured three times attended then three times unattended or vice -versa  
depending on their randomization assignment.   After completion of the clinic BP measurement s, staff will 
obtain the participant’s randomization assignment for measurement of ABPM or HBPM (i.e., ABPM followed by  
HBPM or HBPM followed by ABPM ; randomization 2 in Figure 2) from the study website.  Depending on their 
randomization assignment , partici pants will be fitted with the ABPM device and given instructions on the 
procedure ( Section D. 8.4.2.) or given the HBPM device and instructed in  its use  (Section D.8.4.3.). All 
participants will be fitted with an Actiwatch (wrist actigraph)  and given a n ABPM or HBPM D evice Log.       
D.6.3. Study Visit 3. Study Visit 3 will occur the day after Study Visit 2 and  will follow one of two protocols 
contingent on whether  participants were randomized to have ABPM then HBPM or HBPM then ABPM.  
D.6.3.1. Participants randomized to undergo ABPM then HBPM. At Study V isit 3, participants will have the Table 4. Domains of data collection

Research Strategy                                                                                              Page 78
ABPM monitor and actigraph removed .  Data will be downloaded onto computers dedicated to the current 
study. The ABPM recording will be checked for completeness. If a complete recor ding is not obtained, 
participants will be asked to repeat the ABPM procedure. Once a complete ABPM is confirmed, participants 
will fill out the ABPM tolerability  questionnaire ( Section D. 8.5). This questionnaire will be self-administered 
unless participants are unable to read, in which case, it  will be interviewer administered. Participants will be 
given an HBPM device and instructed in its use  as described in Section D.8.4.3. 
D.6.3.2 . Participants randomized to undergo HBPM then ABPM.  At Study Visit 3 , participants will return the 
HBPM device  and have the actigraph removed.  Data will be downloaded onto computers dedicated to the 
current study  and the recording will be checked for completeness. Next , participants will be asked to fill out a 
questionnaire on the tolerability of HBPM ( Section D. 8.5). This questionnaire will be self -administered unless 
participants are unable to read, in which case, it will be interviewer administered.  Participants will  be fitted with 
an ABPM device and instructed in its use as described in Section D.8.4.2. 
D.6.4. Study Visit 4.  Identical activities will occur at Study Visits 3 and 4  (i.e., the ABPM or HBPM devices will 
be returned, checked for a complete recording, and a tolerability questionnaire will be filled out).  At the 
conclusion of Study V isit 4, participants will be escorted by study staff to the laboratory for an echocardiogram. 
Upon completion of the echocardiogram , participants will have successfully completed the study.   
D.7. Randomization. Each participant  will be randomized two times in the current study.  At Study Visit 1 , we 
will randomize participants to have their clinic BP measured either unattended and then attended or attended 
and then unattended.  After the assessment of clinic BP at Study Visit 2 , participants will be randomized to 
complete ABPM then HBPM or HBPM then ABPM.  Each randomization will be separate and independent.  
Randomization will be performed by site (i.e., UAB and Columbia University) and w e will use block sizes o f 2, 
4, or 8.  Randomization assignments will be generated by a statistician at UAB using SAS Version 9.4  and 
stored in a RedCap database created and maintained by a program mer at UAB ( Secti on D.10.1).    
D.8. Measures.  A brief examination will occur at the end of Study Visit 1.  This exam will include 
anthropometrics, fasting blood and urine collection, and completion of questionnaires. 
D.8.1. Anthropometric measures. With participants wearing a gown provided by the study, a calibrated scale 
will be used to measure weight. Height will be measured with the participants’ shoes off using a metal 
centimeter tape -measure. A flexible tape measure will be used to measure waist  circumference midway 
between the lowest ribs and the iliac crest  and neck circumference at the level of the cricothyroid membrane.  
D.8.2. Blood and urine measurements. A fasting  blood draw will be performed by a research coordinator with  
phlebotomist training, and participants will also be asked to provide an untimed (spot) urine sample.  Total and 
HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, serum creatinine, hemoglobin A1c, and glucose will be assayed. Serum 
creatinine will be measured  using an IDMS-traceable approach. eGFR will be estimated using the CKD -EPI 
equation.67 Urinary albumin and creatinine will be measured using nephelometry.   
D.8.3. Questionnaires. Que stionnaires will be self -administered.  English and Spanish version s of the 
questionnaires will be used.  For participants who cannot read, questionnaires will be interview administered. D.8.3.1. Sociodemographic factors and medical history .  Age, race/ethnicity, sex, household income, 
education, medical history (e.g., history of diabetes) and medication use will be determined by questionnaires. We will adapt questionnaires from our prior NIH - and AHA -SFRN funded studies for administration.   
D.8.3.2. Psychosocial factors. Depressive symptoms will be assessed using the 20 -item Centers for 
Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES -D)
68; discrimination by a questionnaire used  in the  Coronary Artery 
Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study69, 70; perceived stress by the Perceived Stress Scale71; and 
trait anxiety by the State -Trait Anxiety Inventory –Trait Scale  (TAI).72 These scales are written at less than the 
8th grade level, should take 20 minutes to complete and have been validated in multi -ethnic populations.73 
D.8.3.3. Sleep duration and quality. Sleep duration and quality will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality I ndex (PSQI), a validated instrument that provides a measure of global sleep quality and sleep duration 
over the previous month.74  
D.8.3.4. Seasonal temperature.  High and low outdoor temperatures will be recorded using National Oceanic Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul
Research Strategy                                                                                              Page 79
and Atmospheric Administration data for the ABPM and home sleep BP monitoring periods .  We will use these 
data to investigate whether temperature affects the association of unattended versus attended c linic BP with 
ABPM and the correlation of sleep BP on ABPM compared with HBPM.  The temperature of the room where 
clinic BP is measured will be kept at 72 degrees and checked prior to each participant’s clinic visits.  
D.8.4. Blood pressure. 
D.8.4.1 . Clinic BP . We will assess clinic BP on two separate  occasions, on consecutive days. Every effort will 
be made to conduct clinic BP measurements at the same time of day with the morning preferred for all 
participants.  At each visit, BP will be measured three times attended and three times unattended using the 
arm with higher BP during the screening visit. The ordering of approaches will be randomized so that 50% of 
participants have attended BP measured first and unattended BP measured second at Study Vi sit 1 and the 
remaining 50% of participants will have unattended BP measured first followed by attended BP measurements  
at Study Visit 1 . We selected to use the Omron HEM -907XL, rather than the Watch BP Office automated 
device as it has been used in US stu dies including a sub-study of NHANES participants and SPRINT .75-77  We 
are not using the BPTru automated BP device as its manufacturer  went out of business in September 2017.    
D.8.4.1.1 Attended clinic BP . For assessment  of attended clinic BP, three readings  will be obtained from the 
arm with higher BP during the screening  visit, using an appropriate-sized cuff and the Omron  HEM -907XL 
(Omron, Bannockburn, IL, USA) , an oscillometric device, by a trained BP technician .  The Omron HEM -907XL 
device has been previously validated  against a mercury sphygmomanometer .49, 50 This device comes with 
small, regular, large and extra -large cuff sizes and the proper BP cuff size will be determined by measuring the 
participant’ s arm circumferences at the mid -point between the acromion and olecranon. Participants will be 
asked  to sit quietly for at least 5 minutes, in a comfortable posture, with feet flat on the floor prior to their BP 
measurement  with the technician in the room . Three BP readings separated by one minute will be obtained 
with the participant seated with their b ack supported and their  arm positioned at heart level. The BP technician 
will initiate each reading by pushing the “Start” button on the device.  The three BP readings will not be visible 
to the technician or participant until after the procedure is complete.  D.8.4.1.2. Unattended clinic BP. We will obtain unattended clinic BP measurements using the  same Omron 
device used for attended clinic BP measurements (Omron HEM -907XL ). It has a memory chip that stores the 
individual BP readings. The device will be programmed to take three BP readings  automatically, spaced one  
minute apart  from the same arm as the attended readings . After positioning the participant , the technician will 
program the BP device to wait one minute prior to initiating  the three readings .  The BP technician will then 
leave the room (i.e., at the start of the one minute resting period).  The BP technician will stay outside of the 
room for 5 minutes to ensure that all three unattended BP measurements are obtained without inter ruption.   To 
avoid possible reactive effects in the participant, the three BP readings  will not be visible to participants . 
D.8.4.2. ABPM  and Actigraphy . ABPM will be performed in the same arm used to measure clinic BP. An 
appropriate BP cuff size will be selected based on the measurement of each participant’s arm circumference. 
The monitor (SpaceLabs 902 27) will be initialized, and the participant fitted with it. The SpaceLabs 902 27 
monitor  has been previously validated and we have used this device in a prior project.
78 The ABPM device will 
be programmed to take readings every 30 minutes  over the 24-hour monitoring period . BP readings on the 
ABPM will not be visible to participants.  Each participant will be instructed to keep his/her arm still and in the 
neutral position from the time that s/he feels the arm cuff begin to inflate until it is fully deflated. Participants will 
also be fitted with an Actiwatch activity monitor (Philips Respironics, Bend, OR ) on the ir wrist to wear during 
the 24-hour ABPM period. Actigraphy will provide estimates of sleep and awake times. The actigraphy data will 
be merged with the corresponding BP measurements, based on the synchronized time stamps recorded by 
both devices. Participants will be  given a phone number to speak with  a staff member if a problem with the 
monitor  occurs . Participants will fill out the ABPM Device Log, which will confirm  sleep and awake times.  
D.8.4.3. Sleep HBPM  and Actigraphy . The participant will be given a sleep HBPM device (HEM-7080IC, 
Omron, Bannockburn, IL, USA) with appropriate -sized cuff and instructed in how to put on the cuff and use the 
monitor properly. Participants will be instructed to put the HBPM device on the same arm used for all other 
study procedures , the evening they leave the clinic visit.  They  will also be fitted with an Actiwatch activity 
monitor on their wrist to wear during the HBPM period.  Participants will be instructed to put on the HBPM 
device before going to bed and to keep it on until they wake up in the morning (i.e., after 5am).  The device will 
be programmed to  take 3 readings, at 2am, 3am, and 4am.  Participants will be trained to fill out the HBPM 
Device Log, which documents sleep and awake times .  BP readings on the HBPM will not be visible to 
participants.  One night of sleep HBPM will be conducted.  
D.8.5. T olerability of ABPM  and HBPM. Tolerability for undergoing ABPM and HBPM will be assessed  using 
a 15-item questionnaire .16  This questionnaire has items assess ing the comfort with wearing the devices and Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul
Research Strategy                                                                                              Page 80
disturbances resulting from completing ABPM  and HBPM .  Additionally, there are questions on pain, skin 
irritation and bruising resulting from wearing the devices .  Eight  of the questions are answered with a Likert-
type scale (e.g., Did you find the monitor interfered with your  normal sleeping pattern? With response options 
of 0 “ Not at all”, 5 “Somewhat”, 10 “Extremely ”). The remaining 7 questions have response options of  “yes” or 
“no” (e.g., “Did you experience pain from wearing the monitor? ”).  
D.8.6. Echocardiogram. Standard high -quality echocardiograms (M-mode, 2D, and Dop pler) will be 
performed b y certified research sonographers at UAB and Columbia University  using a Phillips iE33 ultrasound 
machine . All images will be recorded and stored digitally for offline analysis  at the Cardiovascular Physiology 
Research  Laboratory  at Columbia (Director, Dr. Shimbo) . Cardiac measurements will be obtained according to 
the 2015 recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE)  and European Association of 
Cardiovascular Imaging  (EACVI).79 Left ventricular (LV)  measurements for LV end -diastolic dimension 
(LVEDd), septal wall thickne ss (SWTd), and posterior wall thickness (PWTd) will be obtained . LVM (grams) will 
be determined using the ASE formula. LVMI will be calculated as LVM divided by body surface area (g/m2) and 
secondar ily by dividing by height2.7 (g/m2.7). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) will be examined as an outcome 
in exploratory analyses , GHILnHG aV /90, ≥  gm2 Ln IHmaOHV anG ≥ 11 gm2 in males  RU /90, ≥ 45 gm2.7 in 
IHmaOHV anG ≥ 49 g/m2.7 in males, when LVM is indexed to height2.7). Per ASE/EACVI guidelines, the method 
for LV mass estimation and the definition of LVH does not differ by race. Table 5 shows additional measures. 
D.8.7. Albuminuria.   The urine sample collected during the first visit will be used  for the measurement of 
creatinine and albumin. Consistent with prior research, urinary albumin excretion rate will be calculated using 
the formula: urinary albumin in milligrams per liter / (k * urinary creatinine in grams per liter) (denoted A/kC), where  k adjusts for race and sex differences in typical daily creatinine excretion. Urinary creatinine 
concentration in men will be multiplied by 0.68 and by 0.88 for African Americans .
80  This approach  will allow 
the use of 25 mg/g as the A/kC cut -point for microalbuminuria regardless of a participant’s race and sex.  
D.9. Staff training. Prior to initiation of recruitment, Drs. Shimbo, Schwartz, Muntner, and Oparil will conduct 
centralized training of study staff from each site in the conduct of all study measures including clinic -measured 
BP, ABPM , HBPM , and echocardiography. Once  data collection begins, they will monitor data collection and 
confirm that the study protocol is being followed. Annual centralized re -training will be conducted.  
D.10. Data management. The Pharmacoepidemiology and Economics Research (PEER) Unit (Dr. Muntner – 
co-director) at UAB will provide coordination and logistical support for all aspects of the proposed study. The 
PEER Unit has 3 program coordinators, 2 systems analysts/programmers, 15 PhD and Master’s level 
statisticians and 4 research associates with experience designing data collection systems and analyzing data, 
including ABPM,  from epidemiology studies.  
D.10.1. Study database.  Data collection for this study will occur electronically through a system and website 
developed in RedCap  by Lei Huang  MS, a programmer in the UAB PEER Unit.  RedCap provides a secure, 
password protected, web application that will be accessible to staff at UAB and Columbia University. For the 
current study, our programmer will develop an online database for randomizing participants and electronic 
web-based forms for conducting data collection.  The RedCap platform is HIPAA compliant and we have used 
RedCap in prior studies of ABPM.81 Data collection through RedCap will be converted to SAS Version 9.4.  
D.10.2. Data transfer.  
D.10.2.1. ABPM, sleep HBPM, actigraphy , and Device Logs. Upon return of the ABPM, HBPM, actigraph , 
and Device Logs , data will be downloaded to a computer and then backed up to a secure network server.  Data 
will be transferred daily to the PEER Unit at UAB using DatAnywhere, a HIPAA compliant f ile transfer protocol  
that we used in our AHA-SFRN study . Monthly reports that track  data quality will be generated. If data issues 
are identified (e.g., frequent ABPM or HBPM reading  errors), staff will be re -trained.   
D.10.2.2 . Echocardiographic measures. The echocardiographic studies (with unique study identifiers; i.e. de-
identified ) will be saved to DVD/CD, and backed up to secure research servers  at each site. The studies at 
UAB will be sent to the Cardiovascular Physiology  Research  Laboratory at Columbia for analysis.  
D.10.3. Data management and cleaning. All data cleaning  will be managed by a statistician at the UAB 
PEER Unit supervised by Dr. Muntner . A uniform data editing algorithm, established by Drs. Shimbo and 
Schwartz  and used in prior studies,  will be implemented  to confirm acceptability of the ABPM data and exclude 
extreme outliers. Minimal editing is the general rule; less than 0.1% of readings are typically excluded. The 
awake and sleep periods on ABPM will be defined by the actigraphy  recording, complimented by self -report Table 5. Additional echocardiographic measures .

awake and sleep periods from the Device Log.64, 82 For sleep BP on HBPM, we will confirm that participants 
were asleep when the the BP  readings were obtained using actigraphy  data and the HBPM Device Log.  
D.10.4. Minimum n umber of BP readings required on ABPM  and HBPM. No consensus exists on the 
number of readings required to consider an ABPM recording complete .36 Consistent with our prior studies , we 
will require 14+ awake BP readings , and 5+ sleep BP eadings , and ≥ 80% of the planned 48 readings  (39+ 
total valid readings ). We will require three SBP and DBP readings for a sleep HBPM recording to be complete. 
We will continue recruitment until 600 participants have complete ABPM and sleep HBPM readings.  
D.10.5. Phenotypic measures on ABPM  and HBPM . Awake and sleep BP values will be computed using the 
average of all BP readings from the awake and sleep periods, respectively.  In addition to studying mean BP 
levels, we will calculate three  BP phenotypes: white  coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and nocturnal 
hypertension (Table 6 ). Unatten ded clinic BP thresholds are based on the Canadian guidelines .83 
D.11. Statistical analysis . All data will be analyzed by a statistician blinded to participants’ randomization 
assignments  and a code (e.g., 0 or 1) will be used to represent different randomization assignments. 
Assignments will be unmasked after completion of the statistical analyses. The distribution of each BP 
measure, covariate, and echocardiographic measure wi ll be calculated.  Variables will be explored for outliers  
and when identified the staff in the field sites will be asked to investigate them further .  
D.11.1 Missing data. Missingness in our prior studies  has been uncommon.  Our primary approach to missing 
data is to collect complete data. We will examine missing data and use multiple imputation, as  appropriate.84, 85 
D.11.2 Multivariable adjustment.  Several  analyses  will include multivariable adjust ment .  Multivariable 
adjustment will be guided by biologic plausibility and will be contingent on the specific hypothesis being tested.  In general, we plan two levels of adjustment. An initial model will include adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, sex and clinic site (UAB or Columbia). A second model will include additional adjustment for education, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, stress, anxiety, outdoor temperature, sleep quality, 
diabetes, eGFR, and 10 -year predicted CVD risk. Co -linearity will be assessed using variable inflation factors . 
D.11.3. Exploratory statistics  comparing unattended and attended BP. We will calculate characteristics of 
participants by randomiz ation assignment:  unattended then attended clinic BP measurement or  attended then 
unattended clinic BP measurement  at the first visit.  Scatterplots will be assembled  to show the relationship 
between unattended clinic BP versus awake BP and attended clinic BP versus awake BP. For each 
comparison, intraclass  correlation coefficient s will be calculated . The statistical significance of the difference in 
the correlation coefficients will be calculated using the Fisher r -to-z transfor mation accounting for the 
correlation between attended and unattended clinic BP.
86, 87 We will also assemble Bland -Altman plots showing 
the differences between unattended and attended BP, separately, versus awake BP  on ABPM.  
D.11.4. Aim 1. Test whether measuring unattended clinic BP with an automated device will provide a 
more accurate estimate of awake BP on ABPM than measuring attended clinic BP with an automated 
device. Our primary analyses for Hypothesis 1 will be tested using the first three clinic BP measurements 
obtained at Visits 1 and 2 .  In sensitivity analyses , we will use the fourth through sixth BP measurements from 
these visits. Separate analyses will be performed for SBP and DBP.  
D.11.4.1. Hypothesis 1a: The absolute difference with awake BP will be smaller for unattended vs. 
attended clinic BP.  The absolute difference between mean unattended clinic BP and awake BP  and mean 
attended clinic BP and awake BP, separately,  will be calculated. We will test whether these differences are 
statistically significantly different from zero using paired t-tests . Next, we will determine whether the absolute 
difference between unattended clinic BP and awake BP is smaller than the absolute difference between 
attended c linic BP and awake BP by calculating if the  difference in differences  (i.e., absolute difference 
between unattended clinic BP and awake BP minus the absolute difference between attended clinic BP and 
awake BP) is less than zero  using a paired t-test.  If the absolute differences between unattended and 
attended clinic BP and awake BP differs by randomization assignment,  we will use a mixed model with 
randomization assignment as a covariate . This analysis will be performed in the overall population and in sub-
groups defined by age ( categorized  in tertiles), race/ethnicity (white, African American, Hispanic) and sex.   
D.11.4.2. Hypothesis 1b : The agreement between hypertension in the clinic and awake hypertension 
will be higher for unattended versus attended clinic BP.  Also, the prevalence of both white  coat and 
masked hypertension will be lower when BP is measured unattended versus when it  is measured Table 6. Phenotypes to be evaluated in the proposed study.

attended in the clinic. Using the first three clinic BP measurements obtained at each visit  and awake BP from 
ABPM, we will calculate the prevalence of clinic hypertension, based on unattended and attended  
measurements separately, and awake hypertension.  We will calculate overall agreement and agreement 
above that expected by chance alone (i.e., the Kappa statistic) between (1) clinic hypertension, measured 
attended, and awake hypertension and (2) clinic hypertension, measured unattended, and awake hypertension. We will calculate the prevalence of white  coat hypertension and masked hypertension defined 
using unattended and attended clinic BP, separately, and awake BP from ABPM.  The statistical significance of 
the differences in these statistics when BP is measured unattended versus attended will be calculated using 
McNemar test s and bootstrapping techniques  as these measures are not independent . 
D.11.5. Aim 2. Test whether a new HB PM device provides an accurate approach for measuring sleep 
BP.  We will calculate the characteristics of participants randomized to have their sleep BP measured by (1) 
ABPM then HBPM or (2) HBPM then ABPM.  The statistical significance of differences across the 
randomization assignments will be calculated using t -tests  and chi -square tests, as appropriate.   
D.11.5.1. Hypothesis 2a: Sleep BP on HBPM will provide an accurate estimate of sleep BP on ABPM .   
We will assemble a scatterplot of mean sleep SBP on HBPM versus ABPM and a intraclass  correlation 
coefficient will be calculated. T he statistical significance of the difference in mean sleep SBP on HBPM versus 
ABPM will be calculated using paired t -tests . The analysis will be repeated using sleep DBP on HBPM versus 
ABPM. We will create Bland -Altman plot s showing the difference between sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM 
by ABPM sleep BP level.  We will calculate the percentage of participants who have a 10 mm Hg or larger 
absolute difference in their mean sleep SBP or a 5 mm Hg or larger absolute difference in their mean sleep 
DBP when measured by HBPM versus ABPM.  Differences in mean sleep BP (SBP and DBP, separately) measured on HBPM versus ABPM will be calculated within age, race/ethnicity and sex sub -groupings.  We will 
calculate the overal l agreement and Kappa statistic between nocturnal hypertension on HBPM and ABPM, and 
test for a difference in prevalence using McNemar’s test.  We will compare differences in mean sleep SBP an d 
DBP by randomization assignment using t -tests .  If difference s are statistically significant, analyses will include 
adjustment for randomization assignment.  
D.11.5.2. Hypothesis 2b: HBPM will be better tolerated than ABPM.  An overall score on the HBPM/ABPM 
tolerability questionnaire will be calculated by summing the scores on the eight Likert -type items after reverse 
coding positively-framed items (i.e., those with higher scores indicating better tolerability).  Consistent with the 
approach of Viera, pRRU tROHUanFH ZLOO EH GHILnHG aV an RYHUaOO VFRUH ≥5

The cut-point identified for ABPM  will be applied to define poor HBPM tolerability.  Also, the percent of 
participants who report “pain”, “skin irritation” and “bruising” from the ABPM device, and separately, the HBPM 
device will be calculated.  The statistical significance of difference s in responses  to these items when wearing 
the HBPM and ABPM devices will be calculated using McNemar test s.  
D.11.6. Aim 3. Compare the associations of unattended versus attended clinic BP,  unattended clinic BP 
versus awake BP on ABPM, and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with two markers of end -organ 
damage, LVMI and ACR. 
Hypothesis 3a : The association with end-organ damage will be stronger for unattended vs. attended clinic BP.  
Hypothesis 3b : The association with end-organ damage will be similar for unattended clinic and awake BP.   
Hypothesis 3c : The association with end-organ damage will be similar for sleep BP by HBPM and ABPM.  
Below we describe the analysis plan for testing Hypothesis 3a.  The analysis plan will be identical for 
Hypotheses 3b and 3c. We will calculate the intraclass  correlation coefficient s between (1) attended clinic BP 
and (2) unattended clinic BP with LVMI.  The statistical significance of the difference in the correlation 
coefficients will be calculated using the Fisher r -to-z transformation account ing for the within -person correlation 
between unattended and attended BP measurements .86, 87  Also, the association between clinic BP, measured 
unattended and attended , separately, and LVMI will be calculated using linear regression.  For these models, 
clinic BP will be modeled in categories , using restricted quadratic splines, and , if appropriate, as a continuous 
variable (e.g., per 10 mm Hg higher SBP).  Two levels of adjustment will be performed as described in Section 
D.11.2.  For secondary testing of Hypothesis 3, we will model the outcome of LVH GHILnHG aV an /90, ≥  
g/m2 Ln ZRmHn anG /90, ≥ 11 gm2 in men  using Poisson regression with robust standard errors and two 
levels of adjustment ( Section D.1 1.2).  The analyses will be repea ted for the outcome of the ACR. When 
modeled as a continuous variable, ACR will be log-transformed due to its skewed distribution. As a 
dichotomous variable, albuminuria will be defined as an sex/race -adjusted ACR > 25 mg/g.80 
D.12. Sample size /minimum detectable effect s. 
D.12.1. Aim 1 . Sample size and minimal detectable difference calculations were based on 80% statistical 
power and a two -sided alpha level of 5%.  These calculations were performed using simulations and R version Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul
Research Strategy                                                                                              Page 83
3.3.2. W e estimate that a sample size of 600 participants (630 
enrolled participants with 30 participants [5%] not completing 
the study) will allow us to detect small but clinically relevant 
differences for each aim.  
D.12.1.1. Sample size considerations for hypothesis 1a. 
Figure 4  shows the minimal detectable difference in differences  
with awake ABPM comparing  unattended vs attended clinic BP. 
With 600 participants we can detect  that the  absolute difference 
with awake ABPM is 1.5 and 1.2 mm Hg  smaller  for unattended 
vs attended clinc BP assuming a correlation of 0.5 and 0.7, 
respectively  between clinic BP and awake BP on ABPM. In a 
sub-group of 160 participants (e.g., African Americans), we can 
detect that the absolute difference with awake ABPM is 3.1 and 
2.4 mm Hg smaller  for unattended vs. attended clinic BP.  
Smaller absolute differences can be detected if the correlation 
between attended and awake BP  is higher.  
D.12.1.2. Sample size considerations for hypothesis 1b. If 85% of participants have the same 
concordance/discordance status for both comparisons (i.e.,  attended clinic hypertension versus  awake 
hypertension and unattended clinic hypertension versus  awake hypertension), enrollment of 600 participants 
will provide 80% statistical power to detect a difference of 5% in the  two overall  agreements (e.g., 70% vs. 
75%). If the expected agreement is 50%, we will have an 80% statistical power to detect a difference between 
Kappa  statistics  of 0.4 and 0.5 using a  two-sided  alpha level of 0.05. With 600 participants and a phenotype 
prevalence of 15%, we can detect a difference in the prevalence of 4% when clinic BP is measured unattended 
versus attended. In a sub -group of 16 0 participants, we can detect a difference of 8 %. Based on these 
estimate s, we chose to enroll 630 participants in the proposed study (n=600 with complete data) . 
D.12.2. Aim 2 
D.12.2.1. Minimum detectable effect size - hypothesis 2a. We assumed a standard deviation of sleep SBP 
of 15 mm Hg and sleep DBP of 10 mm Hg when measured using ABPM and HBPM. Also, the correlation 
between sleep BP on ABPM and HBPM was assumed to be 0.5 for SBP and DBP.  For this analysis, we are 
testing that mean sleep BP is equivalent when measured by HBPM and ABPM.  A sample size of 600 
participants will provide 80% statistical power to exclude an absolute mean difference equal to or larger than 
2.1 mmHg for SBP or 1.4 mmHg for DBP comparing ABPM versus HBPM  exists.  In a sub-group of 16 0 
participants, we can exclude an absolute mean difference equal to or larger than 4. 0 mmHg for SBP or 2. 7 
mmHg for DBP. If the correlation of sleep BP on ABPM and HBPM is higher  (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9) , we can exclude 
smaller absolute differences.  A sample size of 600 participants w ill provide narrow confidence intervals for the 
observed agreement and kappa statistic for nocturnal  hypertension comparing HBPM and ABPM. For 
example, the 95% confidence interval for an observed agreement of 80% and 90% would be 77% -83% and 
88%-92%, respectively, and for a kappa statistic of 0.6 and 0.8 would be 0.54 -0.66 and 0.75-0.85, respectively. 
D.12.2.2. Minimum detectable effect size - hypothesis 2b. By definition, 25% of participants will have poor 
tolerance to ABPM . The minimum detectable dif ference in the prevalence of poor tolerance comparing HBPM 
versus ABPM depends on the percentage of participants who have poor tolerance to one method but not to the 
other. With a sample size of 600 participants, we can detect a difference in poor tolerance of ABPM and HBPM of 3% (25% versus 22%) if 20% of participants report poor tolerance to both methods  (e.g., if 5% has poor 
tolerance to ABPM but not to HBPM, and 2% has poor tolerance to HPBM but not to ABPM). Assuming 5% of 
participants experience bruising with both ABPM and HBPM, we will have 80% power to detect a difference in the prevalence of bruising of 3% or larger comparing ABPM and HBPM.

D.12.3. Aim 3. Table 7  shows minimum detectable differences in correlation coefficients for hypotheses 3a, 3b 
and 3c with the full population (n=600 ) or a sub -group (n=160) of participants. For example, if the correlation 
between attended and unattended clinic BP is 0.5, and the correlation between attended BP and LVMI is 0.3, Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul

we will have 80% power to detect a difference in the correlation between attended and unattended BP and 
LVMI of 0. 11 or larger  (e.g., 0.30 versus 0.41) . Detectable differences in the correlation coefficients will be 
modestly larger in sub -groups of 160 participants. The detectable differences will be smaller if the correlation  
between attended and unattended clinic BP  is higher  (e.g., 0.7) .  
D.13. Potential problems and alternative strategies . 
D.13.1. Why we are not examining individuals with treated hypertension.  The focus of this application is 
on the diagnosis  of hypertension. Many guidelines and scientific statements recommend ABPM for confirming 
the diagnosi s of hypertension.2, 38  Although ABPM can also be used to monitor on -treatment BP for people 
with hypertension  and who are taking antihypertensive medication, this is a less common recommendation .   
D.13.2. Why is ABPM and not HBPM the reference standard for awake BP.  We have chosen to use ABPM 
rather than HBPM to assess awake BP because it is widely considered the reference standard  for out -of-clinic 
BP assessment  and confirming hypertension status .4 Further, conducting HBPM to assess awake BP was not 
practical for the proposed study  because it requires up to 7 days of measurements , which will confound the 
ability to assess the tolerability of the HBPM device  for assessing sleep BP, based on a single night.   
D.13.3. Why we are not comparing BP dipping and morning surge assessed using HBPM versus ABPM. 
We are not studying BP dipping and morning surge because the prognostic value of these phenotypes is 
unclear.  Some studies have reported associations of these phenotypes with outcomes while others have 
not.88-90  Additionally, the reproducibility of these phenotypes is poor.91-93  Finally, these phenotypes are not 
widely used in clinical practice  particularly for the diagnosis of hypertension.  
D.13.4. Hypotheses in Aim 1 but not Aim 2 (or vice versa) are confirmed. If the hypotheses in Aims 1 and 
2 are confirmed, there will be a  unified approach to accurately diagnose hypertension without ABPM (i.e., 
conduct unattended BP for detecting awake hypertension and HBPM for detecting sleep hypertension). If the 
hypotheses for only one aim are confirmed, then our study would inform when unattended BP or sleep HBPM 
should be used. For example, if Aim 1 but not Aim 2 is confirmed, unattended BP measured in the clin ic can be 
used to assess  awake hypertension but an abbreviated form of ABPM (conducted during the sleep period) is  
needed. If Aim 2 but not Aim 1 is confirmed, ABPM can be used during the awake period to exclude awake 
hypertension while sleep HBPM , if better tolerated, can be used for assessing sleep hypertension.  In both 
scenarios, the burden of performing ABPM during a 24-hour period is reduced.  
D.14. Translation into practice.  Upon completion of the study, we will conduct a stakeholders meeting with 
clinical leaders in the field of hypertension to develop a statement on the use of unattended BP and sleep 
HBPM assessment in clinical practice. This mee ting will include committee members from the AHA’s Scientific 
Statement on BP measurement , which Dr. Muntner and Dr. Shimbo co -chair.  Dr. Muntner is director of the 
Lister Hill Center for Health Policy at UAB and will use center funds for this meeting.  
D.15. Reproducibility and transparency. We will post the aims, methods, and original analytical plan prior to 
data collection on the Open Science Framework website, which is hosted by the recently founded Center for Open Science (funded in part by the NIH and the National Science Foundation ; https://osf.io), and is open to 
the public to view. Once the proposed study has been completed and before data analys es are initiated, we 
will post the code for derivation of study variables and the final sample size (w ith a flow diagram on how the 
final sample was derived). For each abstract and manuscript, all coding will be carefully labeled and linked to 
the final versions of each document. None of the posted documents will contain participant identifiers.  
D.16. Consideration of sex and other biological variables. We will make every effort to recruit equal 
numbers of men and women. As noted above, we will conduct exploratory analyses stratifying by age group, 
sex, and race/ethnicity  (white, African American , and Hispanic ; a minimum of 1 60 each).  
D.17. Summary. In clinical practice, BP is typically  measured in the clinic by a technician/healthcare provider . 
This approach often leads to an inaccurate diagnosis of hypertension . Several guidelines  and scientific 
statements recommend the use of ABPM, which measures BP during the awake and sleep periods, for 
confirming the diagnosis of hypertension.
27, 38, 94 However, ABPM is not being done in clinical practice due to 
several barriers  that limit its widespread use . Therefore, new and innovative approaches for diagnosing 
hypertension without conducting ABPM  are needed. Some  data suggest that BP measured unattended versus 
attended is closer to awake BP on ABPM.  However, these data were derived from uncontrolled, non-
randomized  studies of select patients and were considered sufficiently low quality in the Canadian Guidelines 
to warrant a Grade D level of evidence. Another approach is to use a new HBPM device  that has been 
developed to assess sleep BP. Using a randomized controlled trial design, the study will rigorously test these 
two non-ABPM approaches for determining awake and sleep BP. The novel approaches being tested can be 
adopted in clinical practice and may be come the standard -of-care for  diagnos ing hypertension if our 
hypotheses are confirmed . Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul

E. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
E.1. Protection of Human Subjects  
E.1.1. Risks to the Subjects  
Human subjects involvement and characteristics:   The proposed study will include 630 participants from 
Birmingham, AL (N=3 15) and New York, NY  (N=3 15).  Study participants will be recruited between 2019 and 
2022 .  Participants will be ≥1 years of age.  No participants will have hypertension and no participants will 
have cardiovascular disease .  We plan for the overall sample to include an equal percentage of men (50%) 
and women (50%) and at least 25% of the population will be white, 25 % African Americans and 25% Hispanic. 
Sources of materials:   Research material for the study includes self-report and physiological data, both of 
which are collected specifically for the purpose of the study.  The physiological measurements consist of the 
assessment of orthostatic hypotension (from supine and standing blood pressure measurements), noninvasive 
measurement of blood pressure in the clinic during two study visits and outside of the clinic using ambulatory 
blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitoring during sleep , a blood and urine sample, 
actigraphy and an echocardiogram .  Height, weight and waist and neck circumference will be measured during 
a study visit by trained staff. Some participants may experience discomfort during the blood pressure 
measurements. However, the discomfort that is experienced is no more than that experienced during a routine outpatient doctor’s visit.  In our experience conducting ambulatory blood pressure monitoring on over 5,000 
participants, none have experienced a serious injury.  Participants will also complete questionnaires that asks about stress and psychosocial factors. 
Potential risks:   The physical risks of the studies are minimal, as no invasive procedures are proposed. S ome 
discomfort may occur due to the use of the ambulatory blood pressure arm cuff or home blood pressure cuff , 
and no/minimal discomfort is expected with using the actigraph device (it is worn on the wrist like a watch) .  
The discomfort, if it occurs, is minimal and temporary.  Also, some patients may experience discomfort (i.e., 
dizziness) from the assessment of orthostatic hypotension.  Patients may experience discomfort answering 
questions about stress and psychosocial risk factors.  Study physicians will be available to discuss discomfort 
with patients and if necessary, participants will be referred to their doctor to discuss psychosocial factors. If the patient does not have a doctor, we will find a doctor for them to see.  D ata will be  stored on encrypted 
computers at the field centers and at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (the coordinating center for this 
study) .  All data will be  stored in locked filing cabinets to protect against the risk of a patient being identified.  
All findings will be presented in aggregate to ensure the confidentiality of all participants.   After study 
completion, the clinic BP, ABPM and HBPM results will be given to the participants and invited to share it with their physician. If the participant does not have a physician, he/she will be referred to a physician for follow- up. 
E.1.2. Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
Recruitment and informed consent:   Participants for the proposed study will be enrolled following IRB -
approved approaches .  Potential  participants for our study will be attending outpatient clinics affiliated with the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham or Columbia  University. With IRB approval , potential participants will be 
contacted following  a routine clinic by phone and screened for eligibility for the proposed study and, if eligible, 
will be told about the study, its goals, activities involved, and potential risks.  Those who remain interested will 
be invited to participate. They will be provided with an informed consent for this study.  The informed consent that will be use d will be  written at the sixth grade level and in a language that potential participants can 
understand. Individuals  will be given time to read over the consent thoroughly and will be encouraged to ask 
questions to help them clarify any issues they might h ave. The principal investigators, co-investigators and 
staff at both sites (UAB and Columbia University) have substantial experience conducting research that includes explaining a study’s purpose and potential risks and benefits to a broad range of partici pants .   
Protection against risks:   The physical risks of the studies are minimal, as no invasive procedures are 
proposed.  Some discomfort may occur due to the use of the arm cuff for measuring blood pressure , and 
no/minimal discomfort is expected with using the actigraph device . The discomfort from the blood pressure 
cuffs, if it occurs, is temporary and should disappear when the cuffs are removed.   Any discomfort, if it occurs, 
is minimal and temporary. The risks of having blood drawn include soreness and bruising at the puncture site, 
and sometimes there may be discomfort during the procedure. Occasionally participants feel lightheaded or faint. This may occur with the assessment of orthostatic hypotension as well.  The assessment of orthostatic 
hypotension and the blood draw will occur in the presence of trained technicians with training handling safety issues for participants. A minimal risk to participants arises from the release of study data.  To minimize this 
risk, staff conducting study visits will be trained in the protection of human subjects.   In addition, all study 
information and the study computer will be kept in a locked room in at the participating field center and 
University of Alabama at Birmingham.  The computer databases will be encrypted and protected by a Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul
Protection of Human Subjects                                                                                   Page 86
password available only to study investigators and other personnel who need access.  The link between 
patient identity and a unique study identification number will be destroyed after the study is completed.  
Published reports will contain only aggregate and statistical results, and no individual results or patient 
identifiers will be disclosed.  These safeguards make the possibility of a breach of confidentiality or invasion of 
privacy remote.  
Very high or low clinic BP. Individuals  with mean screening SBP of 110 to < 160 mm Hg and mean 
screening DBP of 70 to <100 mm Hg (based on the two most recent outpatient clinic visits, extracted 
from clinical records) will be included. Therefore, we are not including individuals with severely h igh or 
low clinic BP. Among enrolled participants, if clinic BP at any of the study visits ≥10100 mmHg RU 
<110/70 mmHg they will be referred to their health care provider for evaluation and excluded from the 
study for safety reasons.  
 
E.1.3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
There is a limited direct benefit to the study participants.  Participants will receive a report containing 
information from their clinic blood pressure measurements, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 
sleep blood pressure. This report will contain mean blood pressure from ambulatory monitoring, information on 
the presence of masked and white coat hypertension as well as information on the level of their blood pressure variability and diurnal blood pressure patterns. Drs. Muntner, Oparil, Shimbo, and Schwartz have over  50 years 
of cumulative experience preparing report s with results and interpretation for study participants . Although 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is not commonly used in clinical practice, some participants (and their 
physicians) may find the results of the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring helpful.  Reports will be provided 
to participants within one month of completion of their study visit.  As the risks to subjects are minimal, and 
important prognostic medical information not typically accessible to subjects will be made available, the 
benefits are considered to outweigh the risks.   
E.1.4. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
In terms of benefits to others, the proposed research is an attempt to better measure blood pressure . Over 80 
million U S adults have hypertension. Studies from Canada have reported that blood pressure measured in the 
clinic by a technician do not represent the true blood pressure a patient experience as they go about their daily 
activities.  However, the gold standard approach to measuring blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, is not readily available and, when available, not well tolerated by patients. We aim to determine 
whether measuring blood pressure using an automated device without a technician/healthcare provider 
present can provide a better estimate of blood pressure .  Also, we will test whether a novel home blood 
pressure measurement device can measure blood pressure during sleep.  The proposed study may provide 
data that transforms how blood pressure is measured and hypertension is diagnosed in the United States.  We 
will assess whether using a novel home blood pressure measurement device is better tolerated for assessing 
sleep blood pressure compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . There fore, not only will we provide 
data on how blood pressure should be measured, this approach may be better tolerated by patients.  Contact PD/PI: Muntner, Paul

Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
A DSMP is proposed even though it is not required by NIH Policy as the study does not pose a 
greater than minimal risk to the participant. The proposed study does not meet the NIH definition for a 
clinical trial (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT- OD-15-015.html) since we are not 
testing the effects of BP measurement on “health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.” A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) is not needed as the study is not a Phase III trial, does not included a high-risk intervention, and does not enrolled a highly vulnerable patient population (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human-subjects/data-safety- monitoring -policy). The MHT 
Study and IDH Study enrolled participants (with similar eligibility criteria as the proposed study) who underwent a BP measurement protocol (including clinic BP measure ment, ABPM, and HPBM) over 
several study visits and had echocardiogram and laboratory measures). These studies were approved by the IRB, who deemed these two studies as having minimal risk.   The purpose of the DSMP is to monitor study safety, ensure the safety of participants (identify, review, and report adverse events to the IRB and/or NHLBI and ensure appropriate medical follow up), minimize research-associated risk, and protect the confidentiality of participant data. IRB approval will be obtained. The DSMP will contain the following elements: an appropriate monitor (person or group), monitoring procedures, frequency of monitoring, collection and reporting of serious adverse events and adverse events, reporting mechanisms of adverse events/ serious adverse events to the IRB and NHLBI, reporting mechanisms of the IRB actions to NHLBI, reporting mechanisms for changes or amendments to the protocol or consent form, potential risks and benefits to subjects, management of serious adverse events or other study risks, conflicts of interest, data acquisition and transmission, data analysis plans, trial stopping rules, and plans for interim analysis. Dr. Muntner (UAB site) and Dr. Shimbo (CUMC site) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis. The PIs will be informed of unanticipated problems or unexpected serious adverse events that may be related to the study protocol as soon as they occur, and they will notify the IRB, and/or NHLBI in compliance with their policies. Personnel involved in monitoring activities will include the following: (1) Along with Dr. Muntner, Dr. Oparil, a board-certified cardiologist will be responsible for overseeing medical risks during the study and will review adverse medical events at the UAB site. (2) Dr. S himbo, a board-certified cardiologist will be responsible for overseeing medical 
risks and will review adverse medical events at the CUMC site.    
 
Participants who have any problems or suspected adverse events during the course of the study will 
be instructed to contact the research coordinator or appropriate study personnel immediately. Site-specific research coordinators will contact the respective PIs if any problems or suspected adverse events are reported by participants. If the participant needs immediate medical attention, he/she will be sent to the emergency room for further evaluation. If the participant does not require immediate medical attention, he/she will be scheduled to see their physician. If the participant does not have a physician, he/she will be referred to a physician for follow- up.  
 
On an annual basis, the PIs will submit a progress report that: (1) Confirms adherence to the DSMP. 
(2) Includes a summary of any data and safety monitoring issues that occurred since the previous 
reporting  period. (3) Describes any changes in the research protocol or the DSMP that may or does 
affect risk. (4) Provides all new and continuing IRB approvals.

E.1.6 Women and Minority Inclusion in Clinical Research  
E.1.6.1. Inclusion of Women  
We will not exclude women for any reason from this research besides having a current known pregnancy. 
Pregnancy is an exclusion because ABPM devices have not been validated for pregnant women.  We will 
not be conducting pregnancy testing because we think that unknown pregnancies will be rare and ABPM devices should be valid in the early stages of pregnancy.  We will aim to have a 50%:50% women:men enrollment.
 
 
E.1.6 .2. Inclusion of Minorities  
We will include participants of all race/ethnicities.  As we propose conducting analyses for the overall 
population and for whites, African Americans and Hispanics, separately, we plan to enroll at least 25% 
(n=160) of our sample to be white, at least 25% (n=160) to be African American and at least 2 5% (n=160) 
to be Hispanic. We will track enrollment into our study to ensure that our goal is achieved.  The diversity of 
the populations at Columbia University and UAB is a major strength of this study, and will enhance the 
generalizability of our results.  
 
Our prior studies at Columbia University (with similar eligibility criteria as the currently proposed study) have 
enrolled the following percentages of Non-Hispanic Black  and Hispanics : 20% to 36%  and 29% to 64% , 
respectively.  Our prior studies at UAB (with similar eligibility criteria as the currently proposed study) have 
recruited equal percentages of men and women and whites and non-Hispanic blacks. Also, Birmingham, 
Alabam a has a rapidly growing Hispanic population facilitating the recruitment of member of this group into the 
proposed study.

ObjectivesPrimary Objective(s):  
Phase  I:
To identify  maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nivolumab for 
combination treatment of nivolumab and Y-90 in patients with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Phase  Ib:
To evaluate the  proportion of patients with objective response 
rate (ORR) to the combination treatment of nivolumab with Y-90.
Secondary Objective(s):
To  evaluate the toxicities (according to the NCCN CTCAE v4.03)  
and tolerability of nivolumab and y-90 in patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma 
To  evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free 
at 24 weeks in the described population.
To  evaluate the disease control rate for the combination of Y-90 
and nivolumab at 24 weeks from starting nivolumab treatment. 
Exploratory Objective(s):
Intratumoral Assessment:  Fresh biopsy or archived tissue will be 
used if available.  PD-L1 protein on tumor cells and the 
expression levels of other markers of inflammatory/immune 
signature that may include but not be limited to PD-1, OX40, 
CD73, CD39, T cell immunoglobulin and TIM3, GITRL, CTLA-4, 
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, FOXP3, and granzyme by IHC and/or 
flow cytometry will be evaluated. Whole exome sequencing and 
computational analyses will be performed to assess mutanome 
and immunome (subpopulations of immune cells).
Circulating  free DNA (cfDNA) mutation analyses: Blood will be 
drawn before treatment and every 8 weeks with imaging for the 
first 24 weeks then every 16 weeks until disease progression. 
Change in clonal burden landscape of various mutanome and 
immunome will be analyzed to investigate its correlation with 
treatment response or development of resistance to treatment. 
Sample SizePhase 1:  9-15 patients, Phase 1b requires 29 patients in a two-stage 
optimum Simon design.  The 6 at the MTD in Phase 1 are counted as 
part of the 29.  This would require up to 15 in Phase 1, 23 new patients 
in Phase 1b for a total of 38 patients.  Target accrual is 40 patients to 
account for potentially unevaluable patients.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 8Treatment PlanY-90 will  be administered once at a calculated dose based on the 
volume of liver tissue supplied by the artery to be infused (lobar, 
segmental, subsegmental) and the estimated lung shunt fraction. 
TheraSphere dosimetry is independent of the tumor burden.
Nivolumab will be  administered as an IV infusion 7-14 days after Y-90 
administration. The first 3 patients in Phase I are treated at 80mg IV 
every 2 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or 
withdrawal of consent. Remaining patients will then follow the standard 
regimen of 240mg every 2 weeks until disease progression, intolerable 
toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. See section 4.3 for dose escalation 
details.  
Statistical MethodologyThis is  a Phase I/Ib study with dose identification in the initial phase and 
safety/tolerability in the phase Ib section. The expected number of 
patients on dose escalation will be in the range of 9-15 based on the 
3+3 design. Six patients will be treated at the MTD in the dose 
escalation phase.  The dose calculation for Yttrium-90 Therasphere will 
be done according to standard protocol at Northwestern Memorial 
Hospital. Please note - details of this are located in section 8.1. The 
Phase 1b expansion cohort will be a two-stage optimum Simon design 
with 29 patients.  See Section 10.0 for details.
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION  – BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
1.1 Disease  Background
The incidence  of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has risen over the last 3 decades.(1,2) 
Therapeutic options for HCC are complex. Treatment with ablative liver directed therapies 
or resection are often suboptimal due to cumulative local or de novo recurrence rates of 60 
to 100% at 5 years.(3-5) Orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) offers the best chance for long 
term survival after the detection of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by removing the 
entire pre-neoplastic cirrhotic liver. However, with the growing number of patients who 
require OLT, prolonged waiting times can often lead to drop out from the transplant list due 
to tumor progression.(6) Patients with HCC within Milan criteria (a single lesion ≤ 5 cm or 3 
lesions ≤ 3 cm, without gross vascular invasion) are granted an upgrade in order to 
expedite the access of patients with early HCC to transplantation before tumor 
progression.(7-9) With increasing Hepatitis C virus infection, HCC incidence and cancer 
death owing to this is becoming the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. 
Furthermore, HCC arises on a background of chronic inflammation due to underlying viral 
infection, which in turn creates an ideal environment for tumor cells to accumulate 
mutations. These mutations have made HCC resistant to traditional chemotherapy and 
treatment with chemotherapies is further limited by impaired hepatic function (10). The only 
current systemic therapy approved for HCC is Sorafenib, based on the results of the 
SHARP trial (11). While, many agents have looked promising they have failed to 
demonstrate sufficient improvement for this difficult population. 
HCC is  a highly vascular tumor. Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the early stages of 
carcinogenesis, progression and development of metastasis in HCC. Vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) expression has been found to correlate with important 
clinicopathological factors and risk of recurrence post resection.(10) Environmental factors 
such as hypoxemia are known to upregulate the expression of VEGF via hypoxia induced 
factor -1α (HIF).

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 91.2 Intervention Background  & Overview
1.2.1 Preclinical  Evidence for the PD-1 pathway in HCC:
The role of  immune surveillance in controlling growth and the oncogenic properties 
have been well established for several decades. There is now a plethora of 
evidence that describes the correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) within tumor cells and favorable prognosis overall. 
The PD-1  pathway is a major component of tumorigenesis by suppressing the 
immune system. The innate function of the PD-1, when expressed on activated T-
cells is to down regulate unwanted / excessive immune responses thus controlling 
autoimmune conditions. 
PD-1 is  a T-cell co-inhibitory receptor with two well-recognized ligand PD-L1 (B7-
H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC)12. The binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 leads to T-cell 
activation and ultimately several immunosuppressive effects, which includes 
inhibition of cell survival factor Bcl-xL (13,14). Within the HCC, a significant 
proportion of PD-L1 is expressed by Kupffer cells (15) and in turn this expression 
is driven by IL-10 in HCC. The expression of PD-1 is markedly higher in the 
tumor and peripheral blood of patients with HCC compared to controls with 
cirrhosis alone (16). 
A study  of 54 patients with HCC and HBV co-infection who underwent surgical 
resection, the levels of Pd-1 expression was evaluated. This study demonstrated 
that higher versus lower expression of intrahepatic PD-1 on T-cells was 
associated with lower disease free survival (13.6 mths vs. 28.7 mths; p < 0.001) 
(17). Similar results were mirrored when the expression of PD-1 in peripheral 
blood was measured. In addition, the levels of circulating PD-1 correlated directly 
with the stage of HCC. This small study clearly demonstrated that higher levels of 
PD-1 expression in the tumor microenvironment are associated with worse 
overall survival & prognosis. (17)
Chronic Inflammation is  a key feature of hepatitis associated HCC. High rates of 
HCC recurrence after surgical resection is associated with chronic viral infection 
as well as its concomitant inflammatory features which lends itself to set up 
further de-novo mutations and tumor regrowth. Urbani and colleagues (27) have 
shown recently that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is a key contributor to viral 
persistence in HBV /HCV infections. Many studies have demonstrated that HBV 
circulating CD8+ t-cells in chronic HBV infection are in fact PD-1 positive – 
lending to thought that this is due to chronic antigenic stimulation (5). There is 
also up-regulation of the PD-1 system in chronic antigenic stimulation, which may 
be a mechanism of immune tolerance. Furthermore, in-vitro studies have shown 
that blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 increases HBV specific CD8+ T-cells, higher IL-2 
and IFNγ by these cells, suggesting more potent effector activity.
1.2.2 Nivolumab  as a PD-1 inhibitor
Nivolumab (also known  by BMS-936558 or MDX1106) is a fully humanized 
monoclonal antibody of the IgG4/kappa isotype that binds to PD-1 and blocks the 
interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 and PD-L2. Both PD-1 and PD-1 ligands are 
upregulated following initiation of an immune response and help to limit that 
response to avoid tissue damage. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands also occurs in 
some tumors and is thought to contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune 
surveillance of tumors. 
Nivolumab has  been extensively investigated in several large clinical trials thus 
establishing the safety, PK, and clinical activity of nivolumab. To date there are 
approximately 32 clinical trials in various phases (11 phase 1 studies, 13 phase 2 
studies and 8 phase 3 studies) across several histologies (including NSCLC,

either as monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted 
therapies.  Clinical activity has been shown both as monotherapy as well as in 
combination with other immunotherapy agents such as an anti-CTLA4 antibody 
(ipilimumab) with durable responses exceeding 6 months. 
Currently, nivolumab is approved  for treatment of unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma and disease progression on ipilimumab regardless of BRAF mutational 
status. It is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based 
chemotherapy. It is currently approved at a dose of 3mg/kg every 2 weeks and for 
both melanoma and NSCLC. The side effect and safety profile seen to date are 
consistent across all histologies tested. There has been no maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) reached at the monotherapy doses tested up to 10mg/kg. Additionally, 
there was no pattern in the incidence, severity or causality of AEs to nivolumab 
dose levels. 
To-date the  primary treatment-related AEs with nivolumab have included 
pulmonary toxicity, renal toxicity, endocrine abnormalities, GI toxicity, dermatologic 
toxicity and hepatotoxicity.  The majority of the AEs encountered have been 
managed with supportive care and in severe cases a combination of dose delay, 
permanent cessation of the drug and/or addition of systemic corticosteroids. 
There are  now several more studies in the pipeline evaluating the combination of 
nivolumab with other agents. Recently, results from the phase II study of nivolumab 
for patients with advanced HCC were presented. Of 42 evaluable patients, 28 
patients had a response (2 CR, 6 PR, 20 SD) corresponding to an objective 
response rate of 67% (28/42). Further, of the 8 patients with a response, 7 patients 
responded within 3 months of therapy and ongoing response was seen in 6/8 
patients. This further provides evidence to the active role of PD-1 inhibitors in 
advanced HCC regardless of hepatitis status 1. 
1.2.3 Role  for Therasphere (yttrium-90) in HCC:
Treatments, such  as TACE, attempt to take advantage of the vascular nature of 
HCC by impairing the blood supply of the tumor and inducing a hypoxic state. 
Higher baseline serum levels of VEGF have been demonstrated to predict a poor 
response to TACE.(19) Therasphere, a novel therapeutic approach, are composed 
of non-biodegradable glass microspheres coated with yttrium-90.(20) They are 
injected into the hepatic artery and are preferentially trapped in the tumor capillary 
bed relative to surrounding non-tumor parenchyma. The ability to concentrate 
radioactive microspheres within the tumor leads to an "inside-out" radiation, which 
in turn exerts a local tumoricidal effect. Unlike TACE, Therasphere do not induce 
hypoxemia, but rather, requires oxygen for the maximal radiation effect20. 
The mechanistic  differences in TACE and Therasphere theoretically may have an 
impact on angiogenesis and therefore an effect on tumor progression as a patient 
awaits transplantation. Radioembolization of the hepatic artery with microspheres 
coated with yttrium-90, a source of beta energy, capitalizes on the hypervascular 
nature of HCC. The distribution of blood flow is three to seven times greater within 
the tumor than the surrounding noncancerous tissue (1). The preferential delivery 
of microspheres to the tumor capillary bed allows for higher doses of radiation to 
be delivered to the tumor relative to surrounding non-tumor parenchyma. The 
ability to concentrate radioactive microspheres within the tumor leads to an “inside-
out” radiation, which in turn exerts a local tumoricidal effect. In 1999, the FDA

Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 11granted a  humanitarian device exemption for the use of TheraSphere® (MDS 
Nordion, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) for the treatment of unresectable HCC. 
Phase 1 and  2 trials have demonstrated a positive safety profile for TheraSphere 
therapy in patients with a bilirubin < 2 rends in improved survival have been 
reported in patients who received > 104 Gy. Several additional publications have 
testified Y-90 to be a safe and efficacious therapy for unresectable HCC. While 1 
year survival rates are comparable to the RCTs of trans-arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) versus supportive care, no RCTs comparing Thera-
Spheres to TACE have been performed.(30-35)
Radioembolization therapy is  performed in a two-step process: a “trial run” followed 
by the treatment session which is generally performed a few days afterwards. Prior 
to the administration of Y-90, a mesenteric angiogram is performed to determine 
the tumor’s blood supply, aberrant anatomy and to ensure proper catheter position. 
Coiling of extrahepatic arteries may be required to avoid inadvertent delivery of 
microspheres to surrounding organs (stomach, diaphragm and gallbladder). At the 
same time, Technetium-99 macroaggregated albumin (The99Tc-MAA) is injected 
into the hepatic artery to estimate the degree of intratumoral arteriovenous 
shunting. The99Tc-MAA particles are similar in size to the Y-90 microspheres (20-
40 microns) and therefore will simulate the distribution of Y-90.   A single photon 
emission CT is then used to calculate the dose of radiation that will be distributed 
to the lungs and/or viscera. A hepatopulmonary shunt greater than 20% of the 
injected dose, failure to prevent blood flow into the gastrointestinal organs by 
embolization or proper catheter placement will preclude therapy with Y-90. The 
dose of radiation delivered to the lungs is cumulative and should not exceed 50 
Gy. A mesenteric angiogram and 99 Tc-MAA will be repeated before every 
treatment session with Y-90 to evaluate for the degree of shunting. 
The calculated  radiation dose for TheraSphere therapy is based on the volume of 
liver tissue supplied by the artery to be infused (lobar, segmental, subsegmental) 
and the estimated lung shunt fraction. TheraSphere dosimetry is independent of 
the tumor burden. 
Side effects following Y-90  therapy are usually mild and temporary. Fatigue is the 
most common side effect. Fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms may also occur and 
generally require no specific intervention. More serious side effects relate to 
inadvertent migration of a microsphere(s) with radiation exposure to non-targets 
(cholecystitis, gastritis/ulceration, pancreatitis or pneumonitis). Lymphopenia 
presumed secondary to bone marrow suppression has been reported in patients 
treated with Y-90, however there have been no reports of opportunistic infections 
or clinical complication relating to Y-90 therapy. Cases of lymphopenia have been 
extremely rare and asymptomatic. Peak incidence while theoretically can occur up 
to 3 months after therapy, to date no clinical infections or clinical complications 
have been reported in the literature. Patients will have a 4 week break between 
receiving Y90 treatment and starting nivolumab to allow for recovery and to obtain 
repeat scans. A long-term complication of hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension 
has been reported. All patients undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) as 
standard of care with banding of large esophageal varices. While pneumonitis has 
been reported, the number of cases from this remains very few and overall 
incidence is extremely rare; as such current standard of care does not require 
additional pulmonary testing prior to Y-90. All patients will undergo an angiogram 
prior to Y-90 administration to calculate the appropriate Y-90 dose, and presence 
of lung shunt will be ruled out at that time.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 121.2.4 Measurement  of disease response
Insight into  the biological behavior of a tumor may be gained by the response to 
liver directed therapy. A lack of progression with liver directed therapy might lead 
to improved overall survival (OS). A recent study supported that radiographic 
response to TACE could serve as a biological marker of tumor behavior.(21) The 
ability to measure the effectiveness of therapy and/or need for additional treatment 
is restricted by reliance upon radiographic endpoints of tumor size and 
enhancement as opposed to a measurable biological response at the cellular level. 
The shortcomings of conventional imaging to assess treatment response are 
highlighted in studies demonstrating a discrepancy between radiographic 
response and explant pathology.(22,23) Ability to accurately determine efficacy of a 
therapy (radiographically) is vital to obtain the maximal benefit of locoregional 
therapy. The degree of necrosis on explant associated with liver directed therapy 
has shown conflicting results in terms of HCC recurrence post-transplant.(21,22,24) 
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) operates on the premise 
that the diffusion of water within a cell is dependent upon the integrity of the cellular 
membrane. Within viable cells, water movement is restricted by the boundaries of 
an intact cellular membrane, whereas in necrotic cells, water is able to freely 
diffuse. The distribution of water within a given area can be calculated as an 
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and provide functional information for a given 
lesion. Increased diffusion of water within a targeted lesion has been shown to be 
a reliable early marker of treatment response to radiation and chemotherapy in 
brain and breast cancer.(25,26) More recently, diffusion weighted MRI has been 
reported to detect treatment response in HCC after chemoembolization and 90Y 
radioembolization.(27-29) Detection of early treatment response with necrosis of the 
targeted tumor may act as a surrogate marker for selection of patients most likely 
to benefit from transplant. Such a tool could also prevent unnecessary repeated 
therapeutic sessions and the associated potential complications including 
treatment induced liver failure. Necrosis induced by systemic therapies such as 
nivolumab would also be expected to be detected with diffusion-weighted imaging.
1.3 Rationale  for combining Y-90 with nivolumab:
As described above,  there is evidence that manipulating the PD-1 pathway in HCC affects 
the balance between anti-tumor active and immune tolerance in advanced HCC. 
Nivolumab has recently been approved for the treatment of squamous non-small cell lung 
cancer and melanoma. The paucity of good treatment options in advanced HCC (apart 
from Sorafenib) creates an ideal environment to pursue immune-modulation in this 
population. Due to the complexity of hepato-carcinogenesis, including the heterozygosity 
of genetic alterations involved in the development and progression of HCC, it is likely that 
a combination approach with systemic immune therapy and liver directed therapy will be 
needed to obtain the most efficacious "kill" of tumor cells.  A decrease in angiogenesis both 
locally within the treated tumor as well as in any clinically undetectable tumor cells would 
hopefully decrease the incidence of progression of HCC and might even allow for some 
patients to become transplant eligible. 
It is  for these reasons; we wish to proceed with this early phase study to evaluate the 
combination of Y-90 and nivolumab for treatment of advanced HCC. There is no data 
available that currently combines these two modalities in HCC.
1.3.1 Rationale  for Nivolumab Dosing 
The safety and  efficacy of 240 mg (monotherapy) Q2W flat dose of nivolumab 
has recently received IRB approval and is expected to be similar to the 3 mg/kg 
Q2W dosing regimen. Using the population PK (PPK) model, exposure of 
nivolumab at 240 mg flat doses is identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects 
weighing 80 kg, which is the approximate median body weight in nivolumab 
clinical trials. Across the various tumor types in the clinical program, nivolumab

Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 13has been  shown to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg, and 
the relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy 
and safety has been found to be relatively flat. Given the similarity of nivolumab 
PK across tumor types and the similar exposures predicted following 
administration of 240 mg flat doses compared to 1mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, it is 
expected that the safety and efficacy profile of 240 mg nivolumab will be similar 
to that of 3 mg/kg nivolumab. 
A phase  I dose escalation of nivolumab starting at 80mg is included in this study 
given the lack of data combining nivolumab with Y-90.
1.4 Hypothesis  
Subjects treated  with nivolumab will have an overall improved response to liver directed 
therapy with Y-90 (Therasphere) as evidenced by markers of angiogenesis, radiographic 
response defined by RECIST criteria, immunological markers; leading to improved clinical 
outcome measurements, less recurrence and potentially meet criteria for liver 
transplantation. 
1.5 Exploratory  Studies
It has  been shown in animal models, control human subjects as well as in oncology 
patients that, administration of nivolumab modifies the cytokine levels in plasma.
1.5.1 Exploration of the  correlation between PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression 
and CD4+ and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and PFS, OS and 
response to treatment. 
PD-1 is  a key immune checkpoint receptor expressed by activated T cells and 
mediates immunosuppression. PD-1 functions primarily in peripheral tissues, 
where T cells may encounter the immunosuppressive PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and 
PDL-2, which are expressed by tumor cells, stromal cells or both [1-3]. PD-L1 
and PD-L2 are overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors however no data exists 
in ACC [1].  
There are  conflicting data on the predictive value of PD-L1 expression on PD-1 
directed therapy in solid tumors [1, 4]. Herbst et al showed that patients with solid 
tumors including non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma treated with humanized 
PD-L1 antibody had higher ORR when immunohistochemistry showed intense 
staining for PD-L1 in the tumor [5]. The same correlation was not observed on 
stratified analysis according to tumor cell membrane PD-L1 expression of non-
small cell lung cancer patients treated with nivolumab therapy in the second line 
setting [4].
Pathological slides  from tumor archival tissue will be stained using a monoclonal 
antibody against PD-L1 and defined as PD-L1 positive if equal of greater than 
5% of the tumor cells membrane analyzed. We hypothesize that tumor cell 
membrane expression of PD-L1 or PD-L2 can have an impact on treatment 
responses. 
1.5.2 Peripheral blood  lymphocyte phenotypes
Lymphocyte subsets  (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD56) will be analyzed 
according to absolute cell numbers per microliter of whole blood, percent 
representation among all lymphocytes, and co-expression of the activation 
markers CD25, HLA-DR, and CD45RO using automated flow cytometric 
techniques at the Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory, Robert H Lurie Cancer 
Center of Northwestern University under the supervision of Suchitra 
Swaminathan, PhD.

of nivolumab and y-90 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
2.2.3 To  determine the disease control rate (DCR) to the combination of nivolumab 
and Y-90 at 24 months from the start of nivolumab treatment. DCR is defined as 
the sum of Complete Response, Partial Response, and Stable Disease (DCR = 
CR + PR + SD). 
2.3 Exploratory  Objectives & Endpoints
2.3.1 Intratumoral  Assessment:

cells and the expression levels of other markers of inflammatory/immune 
signature that may include but not be limited to PD-1, OX40, CD73, CD39, T cell 
immunoglobulin and TIM3, GITRL, CTLA-4, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, FOXP3, 
and granzyme by IHC and/or flow cytometry will be evaluated. Whole exome 
sequencing and computational analyses will be performed to assess mutanome 
and immunome (subpopulations of immune cells).  
2.3.2 Circulating free  DNA (cfDNA) mutation analyses: 
Blood will  be drawn before treatment and every 8 weeks with imaging for the first 
24 weeks then every 16 weeks until disease progression. Change in clonal 
burden landscape of various mutanome and immunome will be analyzed to 
investigate its correlation with treatment response or development of resistance 
to treatment.

4.0 TREATMENT  PLAN
4.1 Overview
Treatment will  be administered on an outpatient basis. Patients will first be treated one 
time with liver directed therapy, Therasphere® (Y-90), following institutional procedures**. 
During screening, each patient will undergo an angiogram in interventional radiology to 
determine the appropriate Y-90 dose. Within 7-14 days, patients will begin treatment with 
intravenous nivolumab as maintenance either at 80mg (first 3 patients in Phase I) or 
240mg (Phase Ib if MTD) over 30 minutes (-5 minutes / +15 minutes) every 2 weeks (Day 
1 & 15 of each cycle; 1 cycle = 28 days).
 
After study registration,  the patient will proceed to receiving Y-90 per the standard of care 
procedures listed in section 8.1. Y-90 administration is normally planned around 7 days 
from the angiogram, so registration should be planned accordingly. After completion of Y-
90, patients will have 1-2 weeks recovery time prior to proceeding with nivolumab 
administration (4 weeks if necessary). This window allows for recovery from generalized 
fatigue. Study drug nivolumab will continue until disease progression or withdrawal of 
treatment by patient. 
** Repeat  therapy to the treated lesion or additional untreated lesions may be warranted. 
If a patient requires additional Y-90 after starting nivolumab treatment, it may be given 
once approval from the interventional radiologist and treating physician has been 
confirmed. In such cases, nivolumab should be held for ≥7 days prior to administering Y-
90. Nivolumab can be resumed at least 7 days after receiving additional Y-90, but can be 
delayed for up to 4 weeks if needed. 
4.2 Treatment  Administration
4.2.1 Theraspheres®  (Yttrium-90) 
Institutional Standard  of Care TheraSphere Treatment Procedure:
The calculated  dose of radiation to be delivered to the targeted lesion will be 
calculated by a medical nuclear physicist in Interventional Radiology (Venessa 
Gates MS, DABR, DABSMM) during the screening angiogram. Once the required 
dose of Y-90 is determined, it is ordered from the manufacturer. It is recommended 
the time lapse between work up for Y-90 (angiogram) and the treatment session 
should not exceed 2-3 weeks. 
Please see section  8.1.6 for specific details of Y-90 administration. Patients are 
observed for 2-6 hours post procedure prior to discharge. Patients will be 
evaluated within 14 days after y-90 therapy to assess for side effects, tolerability

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 20of therapy  and laboratory abnormalities. By 12 days post therapy (4 half-lives of Y-
90), the radioactivity of Y-90 has significantly decayed. Tumor response is 
evaluated radiographically 21-28 days post therapy. Maximal therapeutic effect 
may only become apparent 3 months post therapy.  
Based on follow-up imaging,  repeat therapy to the treated lesion or additional 
untreated lesions may be warranted, barring minimal complications with the first 
session. Radiographic evidence of progression of disease following up to 2 
treatments (to the same targeted lesion) of Y-90 may warrant alternative ablative 
or systemic therapies.  These subjects would be considered treatment failures and 
would be terminated from the study. On the other hand, an incomplete response 
or recurrent disease may call for additional therapy.
4.2.2 Nivolumab  
For the  first 3 patients in Phase I, nivolumab will be administered at 80mg as an 
intravenous infusion over approximately 30 minutes (-5 minutes / +15 minutes) 
every 2 weeks (Day 1 & 15 of each cycle) until disease progression or intolerable 
toxicity. 
Dose escalation  to 240mg will be determined in the standard 3+3 fashion 
(detailed in section 4.3). All patients in Phase Ib will be treated at 240mg IV 
nivolumab if determined to be the MTD. Treatment will begin 7-14 days after Y-
90 administration. Patients should have recovered from any side effects resulting 
from Y-90 treatment (to ≤G1 or baseline). If a patient is still experiencing side 
effects 14 days after Y-90 treatment, the patient’s nivolumab treatment may be 
delayed by up to 14 additional days at the physician’s discretion (maximum 4-
week delay). Scans will need to be performed 21-28 days after Y-90 
administration, and will fall during Cycle 1 of nivolumab. If a patient is not able to 
start nivolumab treatment within 4 weeks (28 days), the patient should come off 
study and be replaced. 
Subjects may be dosed no  less than 12 days from the previous dose. There are 
no pre-medications recommended for nivolumab on the first cycle. If an acute 
infusion reaction is noted, subjects should be managed according to Section 
4.2.4. 
Treatment will  be administered on an outpatient basis. Reported adverse events 
and potential risks are described below. No investigational or commercial agents 
or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the 
intent to treat the patient’s malignancy.
4.3 Phase  I Dose Escalation Scheme
In this  phase 1/1b pilot study, the dose escalation component will be for nivolumab, 
starting at a dose of 80mg. Please see the table in statistical section for dose 
adjustments.
Phase I  Dose Escalation Plan based on 3+3 design:

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 21A standard  “3+3” dose escalation design will be utilized. Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled 
at the starting dose (level 1), after which enrollment will be temporarily suspended until all 
3 patients complete the DLT evaluation period (defined as cycle 1 or the first 28 days of 
treatment). Once all 3 patients complete the DLT period and toxicity data has been 
submitted, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the data and 
confirm the presence or absence of any DLTs (defined below). The following rules will be 
used at each dose level to determine whether or not to proceed to the next dose level:
If  0 of 3 patients at a given dose level experience a DLT (defined below), then 
escalation will proceed to the next dose level.
If  2 or 3 of 3 patients at a given dose level experience a DLT, then one of the 
following must occur:
oIf  this happens at level 1, the PI will discuss with DSMC and BMS to 
determine the necessary outcome.
oIf  this happens at level 2 or beyond, the previous level will be declared the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
If  1 of 3 patients at a given dose level experiences a DLT, then an additional 3 slots 
will be added (for a total of 6 patients at that level):
oIf  1 of 6 total experiences a DLT, then escalation will proceed to the next 
level.
oIf  ≥ 2 of 6 total experience a DLT, the previous level will be declared the 
MTD. 
NOTE: Whichever  dose level is declared the MTD must have 6 total patients treated at that 
level. For example, if 3 patients are treated at level 2 and 0 patients experience DLT, 
escalation would then proceed to level 3. However, if ≥ 2 patients at level 3 experience 
DLT, enrollment to level 2 would need to be re-opened to enroll an additional 3 patients at 
that level (with 0 or 1 DLT observed in 6 total patients) in order to declare level 2 the MTD.
4.3.1 Definitions
DLT is  defined as a significant adverse events (detailed below) occurring during 
the DLT period (first 28 days of nivolumab treatment) that is related to nivolumab. 
DLT will be evaluated according to CTCAE v 4.03 criteria. Delay in starting 
nivolumab therapy more than 2 weeks due to toxicity regardless of attribution or 
grade, is considered a DLT
4.3.1.1 Grade  > 3 non hematological toxicity
Grade >3  non-hematological toxicity felt to be related to study medication 
will be considered  dose-limiting with the following clarifications:
Diarrhea  Grade 3 will only be considered dose limiting if it is 
refractory to treatment as outlined in the supportive care guidelines 
(section 4.4.3)
Bloody  or grade 4 diarrhea will be considered dose limiting
Nausea  or vomiting grade 3 will only be considered dose limiting if it 
is refractory to anti-emetic therapy and unable to be corrected to < 
Grade 1  within 24 hours
Rise in  serum creatinine to grade 3, not corrected to < grade 1 within 
24hrs with  IV fluids will be considered dose limiting
Grade  3 metabolic toxicities unable to be corrected <grade 2 within 
24 hours  (like glucose changes, hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, 
hypophosphatemia, and hyponatraemia) will be considered dose 
limiting, unless patient had metabolic abnormalities at baseline. 
Grade 4 metabolic toxicities that are symptomatic will be considered 
dose-limiting regardless of duration or ability to correct.
Other Grade 3  lab abnormalities will only be considered a DLT if they 
do not resolve within 2 weeks.
Elevated  bilirubin will not be considered a DLT unless >3.5 mg/dL

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 224.3.1.2 Hematological  Toxicity
The following  hematological toxicity will be considered dose-limiting:
Grade  4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/ L)
Grade  4 (<500/L) neutropenia
Grade  3 (<1000/ L) neutropenia associated with fever (Febrile 
neutropenia) will be considered dose-limiting
4.4 Toxicity  Management: Dose Delays and Discontinuation
Dosing with  Yttrium-90 will follow standard of care procedures, and there will be no dose 
modifications. 
Any patient  who receives at least one dose of nivolumab will be evaluable for toxicity 
endpoints. Each patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity by laboratory 
results and physical exam at each study visit, according to CTCAE 4.03. 
Nivolumab may  be delayed or discontinued following the instructions detailed in section 
4.4.1. 
In addition, nivolumab  should be discontinued for toxicities as outlined in section 4.4.2. 
4.4.1 Dosing  delays
There will  be no dose modifications allowed for management of toxicities.
Patients will  be allowed to delay nivolumab treatment by up to 6 weeks.  
Nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following until resolution to ≤ 
Grade 1 or baseline: 
Any Grade  ≥ 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, with the following 
exceptions: 
oGrade  2 drug-related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities do not require a 
treatment delay 
Any Grade  3 skin, drug-related adverse event
Any Grade  3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the following 
exceptions for lymphopenia, leukopenia, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin:
oGrade  3 lymphopenia or leukopenia does not require dose delay
oIf  a subject has a baseline AST, ALT or total bilirubin that is within normal 
limits, delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 2 toxicity 
oIf  a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 or 
2 toxicity range, delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity
oDuring  Cycle 1, a delay in dosing is not required for Grade 3 total 
bilirubin ≤3.5mg/dL
NOTE: If  bilirubin worsens after the first dose of nivolumab, a delay in 
dosing may be warranted per physician discretion.
Any adverse  event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in 
the judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study 
medication.  
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents  are associated with AEs that can differ in severity 
and duration than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is 
considered an immuno-oncology agent in this protocol. Early recognition and 
management of AEs associated with immune-oncology agents may mitigate 
severe toxicity. Management Algorithms have been developed to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs:

4.4.2 Treatment  of nivolumab-related infusion reactions
Since nivolumab  contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. 
However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, 
rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypotension, hypertension, 
bronchospasm, or other allergic-like reactions. All grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions 
should be reported within 24 hours to the study QAM and reported as an SAE if it 
meets the criteria. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
(Version 4.03) guidelines. 
Treatment recommendations  are provided below and may be modified based on 
local treatment standards and guidelines, as appropriate:

4.4.4 Treatment  with nivolumab beyond progression
In the event of  an initial assessment of PD (based on RECIST Version 1.1), a 
subject may continue to receive the assigned study treatment as long as none of 
the criteria listed below are met. Criteria for discontinuation of investigational 
product include:
Confirmed  PD without clinical benefit: An initial assessment of PD by RECIST 
Version 1.1 will be confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor 
assessment time point, but no sooner than 4 weeks later (see Section 6.3.3 
for disease evaluation). Patients with confirmed PD at this time should be 
discontinued. However, if a patient with confirmed PD is still receiving clinical 
benefit in the investigator’s opinion, study drug may be continued after 
discussion and agreement between the treating physician and PI. 
Meets any of  the other investigational product discontinuation criteria (Section 
4.4.3) 
Clinical  symptoms or signs indicating significant PD such as the benefit-risk 
ratio of continuing therapy is no longer justified. 
Decline  in ECOG performance status.
Threat  to vital organs/critical anatomical sites (e.g., spinal cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention, and continuation of study 
therapy would prevent institution of such intervention. 
If the  lesions included in the tumor burden subsequently regress to the extent 
that the criteria for PD are no longer met, then treatment may continue according 
to the treatment schedule. 
4.5 Concomitant  Medications/Treatments
Medications or vaccinations  specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from the trial may be 
required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the PI. The final 
decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and /or the 
subject’s primary oncologist. However the decision to continue the patient on trial therapy 
or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Investigator, the study 
Quality Assurance Monitor (QAM) and the subject. 
4.5.1 Acceptable Concomitant  Medications
All treatments  that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare, 
with the exception of those listed in section 4.5.2, may be administered at the 
discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical 
care. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV 
medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of 
drug dosage, frequency route and date may also be included on the CRF. All 
concomitant medications received from the time of informed consent until 30 days 
after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded. Concomitant medications 
administered past 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded 
if given in relation to SAEs. 
Patients who  are on treatment for hepatitis B and C will be allowed to continue 
their medications while on study with close monitoring from their treating 
hepatologists.

Subjects are  prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the 
Screening and Treatment Phase of this trial:
Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy  or biological therapy within 28 days 
of registration.  
Investigational  agents within 28 days of study registration.
Radiation  therapy  within 14 days of registration
Live  vaccines within 28 days prior to study registration and while 
participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not 
limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow 
fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza 
vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; 
however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live 
attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed at any time during the study. 
Glucocorticoids  for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from 
an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. However, 
patients are allowed to use bronchodilators or local steroid injections if 
clinically necessary. 
Subjects who, in the  assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the 
trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be 
medically necessary.
The Exclusion  Criteria describes other medications, which are prohibited in this 
trial. There are no prohibited therapies during the follow-up phase
4.6 Other  Modalities or Procedures
Radioembolization therapy is  performed in a two-step process: a diagnostic angiogram and 
Technetium-99 macroaggregated albumin (99Tc-MAA) scan, followed by the treatment 
session. Y90-specific informed consent will be obtained. Prior to the administration of Y90, 
a mesenteric angiogram is performed to determine the tumor’s blood supply, aberrant 
anatomy and to ensure proper catheter position. Using a unilateral femoral approach, 
selective catheterization of the hepatic artery will be performed. Vascular access is 
obtained via the common femoral artery and a guidewire advanced under fluoroscopic 
guidance. A 5-F sheath is then inserted over the guidewire. The superior mesenteric artery 
is selected and an angiogram performed. 
4.7 Duration  of Therapy
Y-90 will  be administered at the start of the study. A single Y-90 treatment will be 
performed, and nivolumab treatment will start 7-14 days later to allow for full recovery. 
Additional Y-90 treatments may be allowed after discussion with the principal 
investigator**. 
Subjects will  receive study treatment (nivolumab) until disease progression (see section 
4.4.3 for details on treatment beyond initial progression), intolerance due to toxicity or 
withdrawal from the study either by the patient or at the recommendation of the treating 
oncologist. The study may be stopped sooner, for, toxicity, IRB stopping the study, FDA 
stopping the study, sponsor stopping the study, principal investigator stopping the study, 
subject has a positive pregnancy test, use of illicit drugs, non-compliance, deterioration to 
ECOG level 4, progression of HCC, withdrawal of consent (regardless of reason), 
variceal bleeding, or death. Patients will be assessed for response by CT scan or MRI 
every 8 weeks (2 cycles) for the first 13 months, and every 12 weeks (3 cycles) 
thereafter.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 28**Repeat therapy to the  treated lesion or additional untreated lesions may be warranted. 
If a patient requires additional Y-90 after starting nivolumab treatment, it may be given 
once approval from the interventional radiologist and treating physician has been 
confirmed. In such cases, nivolumab should be held for ≥7 days prior to administering Y-
90. Nivolumab can be resumed at least 7 days after receiving additional Y-90, and can be 
delayed for up to 4 weeks if needed.
4.8 Duration  of Follow Up
Once a  patient comes off study treatment for any reason other than death, an End of 
Treatment visit should occur 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the last dose of nivolumab.
Patients will  be followed for survival for up to 2 years after treatment discontinuation. If a 
patient discontinues treatment prior to 24 weeks (6 cycles), they should undergo follow-
up (either by routine clinic visit or by phone call) every 2 weeks until the end of the 24-
week period from start of study treatment to document survival and disease progression. 
After this period, patients should be followed for survival every 6 months for 2 years (by 
routine clinic visit or phone call). Patients should also be followed for SAE’s for 100 days 
after discontinuing study drug.
4.9 Removal  of Subjects from Study Treatment and/or Study as a Whole
Patients can be  taken off the study treatment and/or study at any time at their own 
request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, 
behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation will be 
documented and may include:
Any event  which, in the opinion of the investigator/sub-I’s opinion, requires 
termination of the study/study medications (including non-compliance)
At  the request of the subject (Withdrawal of consent)
At  the request of a regulatory body (FDA, NU IRB)
Patients  with a positive beta-HCG test (consistent with pregnancy)
Use  of illicit drugs or other substances that may contribute to toxicity
Deterioration  of PS to ECOG 4
Progression  of disease, as evidenced by radiologic progression and/or clinical 
status is worsening, subject not benefiting from the study drug.
Development of  a second cancer
Subject  is lost to follow-up
More  than two Y-90 treatments
Grade  4 hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin) defined by the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 of bilirubin more than 10 times 
the upper limit of normal, 
The Northwestern  University Institutional Review Board/Office for the Protection 
of Research Subjects (offices at Northwestern that protects study patients) stops 
the study. 
Death
The study  will be stopped if 2 of the first 5 patients receiving (Y-90 + nivolumab) 
develop grade 4 hyperbilirubememia (>10) OR a death occurs believed to be 
related to therapy and not due to the natural progression of liver disease and liver 
cancer.
4.10 Patient  Replacement
Any patient  who signs consent but does not receive study treatment may be replaced. In 
addition, any study patient who receives Y-90 but discontinues prior to treatment with 
nivolumab can be replaced. This includes patients who cannot start nivolumab within 4 
weeks of Y-90 treatment, who must come off study.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 303 Imaging  will be performed at screening, 21-28 days after Y-90 administration (during Cycle 1), and every 2 cycles (starting with Cycle 3 Day 1, ±7 
days) for the first 13 months. Imaging will then occur every 3 cycles (±7 days) until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. Imaging 
will include either CT of Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis or MRI as indicated. Contrast should be used to the greatest extent possible (see section 
6.1 for details).
4 Coagulation  studies will be performed at the time of the screening angiogram. Patients who are on Coumadin will require their INR to be checked 
every cycle or according to the treating oncologist. If patient is on low molecular weight heparin, an Anti-Xa level should be tested to ensure 
it is within therapeutic range
5 CBC with  differential will include WBC, ANC, ALC, Platelets, and Hemoglobin. CBC should be collected within 14 days prior to registration and 
reviewed prior to each nivolumab treatment.
6 Chemistry  panel will be drawn at screening (within 14 days prior to registration) and pre-dose at all treatment visits. Chemistry panel will include 
glucose, calcium, albumin, ALT, AST, sodium, potassium, total bilirubin, alk phos, and creatinine. 
7 Full hepatitis  panel at screening including HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA. If active hepatitis will need to see hepatologist and begin treatment 
prior to starting on study. Patient should have viral load < 100 IU/mLprior to nivolumab infusion. See inclusion criteria 3.1.5 for hepatitis B 
requirements for eligibility. 
8 FOCBP can have  either a serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration (note: this may be completed as part of the 
angiogram), prior to Y-90 treatment (pregnancy testing is a standard procedure before Y-90), and within 24 hours prior to starting 
nivolumab treatment (scheduled for C1D1). 
9 Prior to  registration, patients will undergo a planning angiogram in IR to determine doses of Y-90. Since Y-90 administration is usually planned 
around 7 days from the angiogram, screening procedures and registration should be planned accordingly.
10 Patients  will receive IV nivolumab starting with Cycle 1 Day 1, which is planned 7-14 days after the induction Y-90 procedure to allow for count 
recovery (Note: Patients can be treated with nivolumab up to 4 weeks after Y-90 in the case of TB or continuing side effects). During this 
break, patient will be evaluated by a medical oncologist as part of standard procedures. Starting with Cycle 1 Day 1, patients will begin 
treatment with intravenous nivolumab as maintenance either at 80mg or 240mg over 30 minutes (-5 minutes / +15 minutes) every 2 weeks 
(Day 1 & 15 of each cycle). Treatment will continue until disease progression, intolerable side effects, or patient withdraws consent or is 
removed from the study for any other reason.
11 Correlative  blood work will be collected for all patients in a 10mL NaHep tube at baseline, post Y-90 treatment (pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1) and 
during nivolumab treatment as follows: pre-dose every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks (C3D1, C5D1, and C7D1), and every 16 weeks 
thereafter (every 4 cycles starting with C11D1). This will be used for peripheral lymphocyte analysis and correlative studies as detailed in 
the protocol. 
12 If  patient has archival tissue present, it will be collected after registration for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry as 
described in section 9.0 and the separate lab manual.
13 An  End of Treatment visit should occur 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the last dose of nivolumab.
14 Patients  will be followed for survival for up to 2 years after treatment discontinuation. If a patient discontinues treatment prior to 24 weeks (6 
cycles), they should undergo follow-up (either by routine clinic visit or by phone call) every 2 weeks until the end of the 24-week period from 
start of study treatment to document survival and disease progression. After this period, patients should be followed for survival every 6 
months for 2 years (by routine clinic visit or phone call). Patients should also be followed for SAE’s for 100 days after discontinuing study 
drug.

Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 316.0 ENDPOINT  ASSESSMENT
6.1 Definitions
Response and  progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) [6]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant 
lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.
High resolution  CT with oral/intravenous contrast or contrast-enhanced MRI is the 
preferred imaging modalities for assessing radiographic tumor response. If a subject has 
a known allergy to contrast material, please use local prophylaxis standards to obtain the 
assessment with contrast if at all possible, or use the alternate modality. In cases where 
contrast is strictly contraindicated, a non-contrast scan will suffice. Screening 
assessments should be performed within 28 days of start of study treatment. If more than 
one method is used at screening, then the most accurate method according to RECIST 
1.1 should be used when recording data, and should again be used for all subsequent 
assessments. 
Radiographic tumor  assessments will be conducted at screening, 21-28 days after Y-90 
administration (during Cycle 1 of nivolumab), Cycle 3 Day 1 (±7 days, 1 cycle = 28 days) 
and every 2 cycles (±7 days) thereafter for the first 13 months. Imaging will then occur 
every 3 cycles (±7 days) until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. Imaging 
will include either CT of Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis or MRI as indicated. Contrast should be 
used to the greatest extent possible. Tumor assessments for all subjects should continue 
as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted. Tumor measurements should be made by 
the same investigator or radiologist for each assessment whenever possible. Changes in 
tumor measurements and tumor responses to guide ongoing study treatment decisions 
will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST. 
.
6.2 Primary Endpoint
The primary  endpoint of this study is establishing the maximum tolerated dose for the 
combination therapy of nivolumab and Y-90. Patients who received at least one dose of 
nivolumab will be considered for evaluation. 
6.3 Secondary  Endpoints
For  the purposes of this study, patients who have received at least one dose of 
nivolumab will be considered for evaluation of the safety and toxicity profile of the 
combination therapy. Safety and tolerability will be measured by the incidence of all 
adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths and laboratory abnormalities. Adverse 
event assessments and laboratory tests will be performed at baseline, and continuously 
throughout the study at the beginning of each subsequent cycle. 
All patients  should be re-evaluated for response 21-28 days after Y-90 then every 8 
weeks (every 12 weeks after 13 months) using RECIST criteria. Overall response will 
be calculated by sum of the complete and partial response rates according to 
measurement of target and non-target lesions as described below.
Disease  control rate will be determined at 24 months from the start of nivolumab 
treatment by the sum of complete response, partial response and stable response 
according to measurement of target and non-target lesions as described below.
Patients  who have a response sufficient enough where by shrinkage of the tumors 
allows them to be considered for transplant will be determined by established BCLC 
transplant guidelines for individual tumor sizes. 
PFS  is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or 
death, whichever occurs first. Progression assessment will be performed by

treatment. OS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death.
6.3.1 Definitions :
Evaluable for toxicity . All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first  treatment with nivolumab. 
Evaluable for objective  response. Only those patients who have measurable 
disease present  at baseline, have received at least one dose of therapy, and 
have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. 
These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions 
stated below. RECIST measurements should be used when available. When 
RECIST measurements cannot be made due to infiltrative disease, evaluable 
disease needs to be confirmed by pathology. 
Evaluable non-target  disease response. Patients who have lesions present at 
baseline that  are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable 
disease, have received at least one dose of therapy, and have had their disease 
re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target disease. The response 
assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of 
the lesions. 
6.3.2 Disease  Parameters 
Measurable disease. Measurable  lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured  in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) 
as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) by chest x-ray or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT scan, MRI, or 
calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in 
millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
Malignant lymph  nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a  lymph node must be ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) in short axis when 
assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm [0.5 cm]). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be 
measured and followed. 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest  diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 
to <15 mm [≥1 to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. 
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal 
masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable. 
Note: Cystic  lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor 
non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. 
‘Cystic lesions’  thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions. 
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5  lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified 
as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 33themselves to  reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly 
should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only 
the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease. 
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions  over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
6.3.3 Response  criteria
6.3.3.1 Evaluation  of target lesions
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether  target or non-target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10mm.
Partial Response  (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of  target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At  least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of  target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm). (Note: the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither  sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase  to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study.
6.3.3.2 Evaluation  of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of  tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-
pathological in size (<10 mm [<1 cm] short axis). 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence  of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of  tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance  of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal  progression of existing non-target lesions. 
Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. 
It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single 
lesion increase. 
Although a  clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, 
the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such 
circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later 
time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 346.3.3.3 Evaluation  of best overall response 
The best  overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. 
Responses will be assessed using CT scans or magnetic resonance 
imaging according to standard RECIST 1.1 criteria in order to assess 
disease progression. These criteria will also allow for patients who 
experience an initial disease flare, and as some patients who will have a 
delayed response may experience an initial disease flare, we will allow 
patients to continue receiving nivolumab beyond progression (see 
section 4.2.5)
6.3.3.4 Duration  of Response 
Duration of  overall response: The duration of overall response is 
measured from  the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR 
(whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). 
The duration of  overall CR is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are first met 
category when  no lesions can be measured is not advised for CR until 
the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.
 
Duration of  stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of 
the treatment until  the criteria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started, including the baseline measurements. 
7.0 ADVERSE  EVENTS
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) of the 
Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (please refer to NOTIS 
for additional information). The level of risk attributed to this study requires High Intensity 
Monitoring as outlined in the DSMP. In  addition, the study will abide by all safety reporting 
regulations, as  set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations.  
7.1 Adverse Event Monitoring
Adverse event data  collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those 
who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a 
routine manner at scheduled times during a trial (see Section 5 and 7.2.5 for time points). 
In addition, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for 
optimal monitoring and patient safety and care. 
All patients experiencing  an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug, 
will be followed until: 
the adverse event resolves or  the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse 
event return to baseline; 
any  abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline; 
there  is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or
death.

Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 357.2 Definitions  & Descriptions
7.2.1 Adverse  Event
An adverse  event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops 
or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or 
injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:
results  in study withdrawal
is  associated with a serious adverse event
is  associated with clinical signs or symptoms
leads  to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests
is  considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance
Recording of  AEs should be done in a concise manner using standard, 
acceptable medical terms. In general, AEs are not procedures or measurements, 
but should reflect the reason for the procedure or the diagnosis based on the 
abnormal measurement. Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or 
frequency during the study should also be recorded (a preexisting condition that 
does not worsen is not an AE). Further, a procedure or surgery is not an AE; 
rather, the event leading to the procedure or surgery is considered an AE.
If a specific  medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded as the AE whenever possible.  However, a complete 
description of the signs, symptoms and investigations which led to the diagnosis 
should be provided. For example, if clinically significant elevations of liver 
function tests are known to be secondary to hepatitis, “hepatitis” and not 
“elevated liver function tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not known, the 
abnormal test or finding should be recorded as an AE, using appropriate medical 
terminology (e/g/ thrombocytopenia, peripheral edema, QT prolongation).
7.2.2 Severity  of AEs
All adverse  events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The CTCAE v4.03 is available 
at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
If no  CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:
Mild  (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily 
activities.
Moderate  (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.
Severe (grade  3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily 
activities or  significantly affects his/her clinical status.
Life-threatening  (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.
Fatal (grade  5): the event caused death.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 367.2.3 Serious  Adverse Event
All SAEs,  regardless of attribution, occurring from time of signed informed 
consent, through 100 days after the last administration of study drug, must be 
reported upon discovery or occurrence.
An SAE  is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward medical occurrence 
that:
Results  in death.
If death  results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be reported 
as event (SAE) itself.
Is  life-threatening.
The patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
Requires  in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours.
Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is  an important medical event.
Any event  that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of the 
investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as a serious 
adverse event. The event may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“. 
For example:  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in hospitalization; 
development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
7.2.4 Unanticipated  Problems Involving Risks to Subject or Others
A UPIRSO is a  type of SAE that includes events that meet ALL of the following 
criteria:
Is  unanticipated  in terms of nature, severity, or frequency
Places  the research subject or others at a different or greater risk of harm
Is  deemed to be at least possibly related to participation in the study.   
7.2.5 Adverse Event Reporting  Period
For this study,  adverse events will be followed from the time of informed consent 
until 30 days following the last administration of study treatment. SAE’s will also 
be collected from the time of consent until 100 days following the last 
administration of study treatment. For patients registered and never treated with 
study drug, SAE’s should be collected for 30 days from the date of consent.
7.2.6 Preexisting  Condition
A preexisting condition is  one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.
7.2.7 General Physical  Examination Findings
At screening,  any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a 
preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 377.2.8 Post-study  Adverse Event
All unresolved adverse  events should be followed by the investigator until the 
events are resolved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct 
each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this 
study.  The investigator should notify the DSMC of any death or adverse event 
occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study 
participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should 
also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a 
subject that has participated in this study. 
7.2.9 Abnormal  Laboratory Values
All clinical  laboratory abnormalities should be documented as adverse events.
7.2.10 Hospitalization,  Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery
Any adverse event  that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization 
should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically 
instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should 
be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and 
adverse event. 
Neither the  condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are 
reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:
Hospitalization  or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
Hospitalization  or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy 
measurement for the study.
Hospitalization  or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of 
the study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital 
admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.
7.2.11 Reporting  of Serious Adverse Events
If a  previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting, the study sponsor will submit the adverse 
event in a written report to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 15 
calendar days from the time the determination is made.
7.2.12 Potential  Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible,  timely  confirmation of initial  liver-related laboratory 
abnormalities should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event.  All 
occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported 
as SAEs. Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:
1. ALT  or AST elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) 
AND
2. Total  bilirubin  > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis  
(elevated serum alkaline phosphatase)
AND
3. No  other immediatel y apparent possible  causes of AST/ALT  elevation  
and hyperbilirubinemia, including,  but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-

If, following  initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently 
discovered that a study subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the 
time of investigational product exposure, including during at least 6 half lives 
after product administration, the investigational product will be permanently 
discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary for 
subject safety). 
The investigator  must immediately notify Worldwide Safety @BMS of this 
event via the Pregnancy Surveillance Form in accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures. 
Follow-up information regarding  the course of the pregnancy, including 
perinatal and neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information 
must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form [provided upon request 
from BMS]
Any pregnancy  that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant 
should be reported to BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on 
the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
7.2.14 Overdose
An overdose  is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any 
dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. 
All occurrences of overdose must be reported as an SAE.
7.3 Adverse Event Reporting
7.3.1 Routine  Reporting
All routine  adverse events, such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or 
definitely not related to study participation, are to be reported on the appropriate 
eCRF according to the time intervals noted in the appendices. Routine AEs will 
be reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) according to 
the study’s phase and risk level, as outlined in the DSMP. 
7.3.2 Determining  if Expedited Reporting is Required
This includes  all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol 
treatment. Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must 
also be reported accordingly.
1) Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4.03.
2) Grade  the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4.03.
3) Determine whether the  adverse event is related to the protocol therapy.  
Attribution categories  are as follows:
Definite:  AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
Probable:  AE is likely related to the study treatment.
Possible:  AE may be related to the study treatment.
Unlikely:  AE not likely to be related to the study treatment.
Unrelated:  AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
4) Determine the  prior experience of the adverse event.
Expected events  are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. An adverse event is 
considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when 
either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in:

8.0 DRUG  INFORMATION
8.1 Yttrium-90 (Theraspheres)
8.1.1 Other  names 
TheraSphere®-MDS  Nordion 
8.1.2 Classification  - type of agent
IRB #: STU00203003-CR0005 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 2/11/2021 through 2/10/2022.
NU Study  Number: NU 16I01
BMS Study Number:  CA 209-615
Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 40Insoluble glass  microspheres where yttrium-90 is an integral constituent of the 
glass.
8.1.3 Mode  of action
Yttrium-90, a  pure beta emitter, decays to stable zirconium-90 with a  physical half-
life of 64.2 hours (2.67 days). The average energy of the beta emissions from 
yttrium-90 is 0.9367 MeV. Following embolization of the yttrium-90 glass 
microspheres in tumorous liver tissue, the beta radiation emitted provides a 
therapeutic effect. The microspheres are delivered into the liver tumor through a 
catheter placed into the hepatic artery that supplies blood to the tumor. The 
microspheres, being unable to pass through the vasculature of the liver due to 
arteriolar capillary blockade, are trapped in the tumor and exert a local 
radiotherapeutic effect with some concurrent damage to surrounding normal liver 
tissue.
8.1.4 Storage  and stability
Each TheraSphere  dose vial contains one of six available dose sizes of yttrium-
90, a high-energy beta emitter. Even with low-density materials such as the acrylic 
vial shield, the attenuation of beta particles gives rise to Brehmsstrahlung radiation 
that requires lead shielding. Users should avoid exposure by leaving the vial in the 
acrylic product container, and by leaving the acrylic container in the lead shield as 
much as possible. The use of additional shielding is recommended. Finger-ring 
dosimeters should be worn in the orientation most likely to record the highest 
exposure to the fingers. The TheraSphere dose vial should not be removed from 
its acrylic vial shield. It should be stored in the lead pot and acrylic shield in which 
it is packaged. The TheraSphere dose vial, TheraSphere Administration Set and 
TheraSphere Administration Accessory Kit should be stored at room temperature. 
The requirements of the applicable regulatory agency for safe handling and 
storage of radioactive materials should be consulted and must be followed.  
8.1.5 Protocol  dose specifics
According to  Treatment Plan. The amount of radioactivity required to deliver the 
desired dose to the liver may be calculated using the following formula:  
The liver  volume and corresponding liver mass may be determined using CT or 
ultrasound scans. 
For the  purpose of ordering TheraSphere, use the Yttrium-90 Physical Decay 
Table (according to appendix 4 Table 3) to determine the appropriate time of 
injection. For determining the actual liver dose (Gy) delivered to the liver after 
injection, the following formula is used: 
where F  is the fraction of injected radioactivity localizing in the lungs, as 
measured by Tc-99m MAA scintigraphy. The upper limit of injected activity 
shunted to the lungs is F x A = 0.61 GBq.

NU Study  Number: NU 16I01
BMS Study Number:  CA 209-615
Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 41The entire  contents of the TheraSphere dose vial are administered to the patient. 
The administration instructions must be followed to optimize delivery of the 
calculated dose. 
1. Place  the Accessory Kit on an appropriate platform, remove the top shield and 
place the TheraSphere dose vial in its lead pot into the pot holder in the acrylic box 
base. Adjust the catheter extension arm to the desired position by pulling out the 
spring lock. Place the hook in its holder on the side of the kit. 
2. Turn  the radiation dosimeter 'ON', set it to the 'dose rate - mR/h' setting, and 
then secure the dosimeter to the holder located on the acrylic box. Record the 
stabilized dose rate reading as the initial reading. 
3. Remove  the sterile Administration Set and empty vial from the packaging and 
place them next to the acrylic box on a sterile surface such as a sterile towel or 
drape. 
4. Insert  the piercing bag spike into the flushing fluid bag, and hang the bag on the 
hook provided on the kit. 
5. Insert  the vented vial spike into the sterile empty vial and place the vial in its 
stand on the exterior of the kit. Snap the relief valve line within the gripper clip A. 
6. Remove  the red shield cap from the plunger assembly and place sterile 
absorbent material under plunger assembly. 
7. Fill  and discharge the syringe to remove air from the Administration Set inlet and 
outlet lines. Visually determine that there are no air bubbles in the lines. Verify that 
there are two steady streams of sterile solution flowing from the plunger assembly. 
8. Remove  the lead pot lid from the TheraSphere dose vial. Remove the tamper- 
evident seal from the top of the acrylic vial shield using a remote handling tool. 
Then remove the acrylic plug. The acrylic plug may be removed by placing surgical 
tape onto the plug and lifting upward. 
9. Swab  the exposed top of the dose vial septum with disinfectant using a remote 
handling tool such as a Kelly clamp 
10. Push  the plunger assembly into the top of acrylic TheraSphere vial shield until 
a "click" or "snap" is heard or felt. 
11. Place  the tubing set through the appropriate openings in the acrylic box. The 
inlet line B goes through opening B on the near side of the box and the outlet line 
D goes through the U-shaped opening D on the catheter side of the box. Loop the 
line around the side of the acrylic box so that connection C rests in the priming 
valve holder C. 
12. Insert  the inlet and outlet needles into the vial by pushing the plunger tabs 
down with sufficient force until a "click" or "snap" is heard or felt.  13. Disconnect the 
outlet line luer fitting E from the priming extension line and firmly connect the outlet 
line luer E to the patient catheter luer fitting. Place this luer connection firmly into 
the holder E on the end of the extension arm on the Accessory Kit. Ensure a 
vertical orientation of the lines and fittings with the outlet line luer connection above 
the patient catheter fitting.

BMS Study Number:  CA 209-615
Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 4214. Place  the top shield lid on the Accessory Kit. Ensure that none of the lines 
(including the infusion catheter) are pinched or have a visible kink. Replace a 
kinked catheter before proceeding. 
15. Flush  the TheraSphere microspheres into the patient by pushing approximately 
20 mL of sterile solution with the syringe. For subsequent flushes pull back on the 
syringe plunger to the back stop of the syringe and then push the plunger again. 
Repeat dose vial flushing until electronic dosimeter reading indicates that an 
appropriate proportion of TheraSphere microspheres have been delivered to the 
patient catheter. A minimum of 3 flushes for a total of 60 mL is recommended. The 
dose vial (still in lead pot) can be gently shaken or tapped to release microspheres 
that may have become trapped on the top of the product vial during shipping. Note: 
Excessive force on the syringe will result in fluid being transferred through the 
pressure relief valve into the attached empty vial. If this occurs, reduce the infusion 
syringe force until there is no fluid flow into the empty vial. 
16. Once  the infusion is complete, cut the inlet line at the indicated position 
upstream of the check valve. Monitor the radiation fields along the lines and use 
remote handling tools to handle areas where radiation fields may be present. Do 
not disconnect the catheter inlet luer fitting from the outlet line. Remove the 
catheter from the patient, and place it into the Nalgene waste container (within the 
acrylic shielding container) with all potentially contaminated materials including the 
acrylic vial shield with the needle plunger assembly still attached, as well as outer 
gloves. Seal the Nalgene container cap in place and place the top lid on the acrylic 
shielding container. Remove the waste for disposal. 
17. Appropriate  radiation protection measures must be employed to remove 
draping materials. The room, equipment and personnel must be monitored for any 
potential radioactive contamination.
8.1.7 Incompatibilities
The use  of TheraSphere is contraindicated in patients: 
whose  Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin (MAA) hepatic arterial perfusion 
scintigraphy shows any deposition to the gastrointestinal tract that may not 
be corrected by angiographic techniques (see package insert);  
who  show shunting of blood to the lungs that could result in delivery of 
greater than 16.5 mCi of yttrium-90 to the lungs. Radiation pneumonitis has 
been seen in patients receiving doses to the lungs greater than 30 Gy  in a 
single treatment (see package insert);  
in  whom hepatic artery catheterization is contraindicated; such as patients 
 with vascular abnormalities or bleeding diathesis;
  who  have severe liver dysfunction or pulmonary insufficiency; and  
 who  present with complete occlusion of the main portal vein (see package 
 insert).

8.1.9 Side  effects
Yttrium-90 (Theraspheres) –  expected adverse events
Based on  clinical and preclinical animal experience with TheraSphere and other 
yttrium-90 microspheres, certain adverse reactions have been identified [4-6, 15, 
IRB #: STU00203003-CR0005 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 2/11/2021 through 2/10/2022.
NU Study  Number: NU 16I01
BMS Study Number:  CA 209-615
Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 4316, 17, 18].  Serious adverse events that occurred under clinical studies and that 
were definitely, probably or possibly related to TheraSphere, or if the relationship 
was unknown, are summarized in Table 1. In addition to these serious adverse 
events, lymphocyte depression, which may be graded as moderate to severe but 
with no clinical sequellae, is expected to occur in some patients.
The introduction  of microspheres into the vasculature of the stomach, duodenum 
or other organs of the gastrointestinal tract may cause chronic pain, ulceration and 
bleeding. Microsphere shunting to the lungs may cause edema and fibrosis that 
may not be reversible.
Extrahepatic shunting  may be identified through the injection of Tc-99m MAA into 
the hepatic artery [19,20]. Flow of radioactivity to the gastrointestinal tract may be 
avoided by the use of balloon catheterization or other angiographic techniques to 
block such flow [21]. In addition, placement of the delivery catheter in the hepatic 
branch distal to collateral vessels provides a safety margin with respect to 
inadvertentdeposition of microspheres.
Some adverse  events observed may be explained by the effect of attenuated 
radiation from the treated liver. Pleural effusion may be caused by attenuated 
radiation when the treated tumor is positioned proximal to the base of the lung. 
Similarly, treatment of tumors in the left lobe of the liver, in proximity to the gut, 
may explain some of the gastrointestinal events observed. Putative attenuated 
radiation effects to extrahepatic structures have generally been found to resolve 
over time.
The use  of this product leads to irradiation of both tumorous and normal liver tissue. 
As a result, patients with diseases that compromise the functioning of their normal 
liver tissue or patients with either diffuse tumors or a high tumor burden may be at 
greater risk of liver function impairment.
A number  of patient baseline characteristics, indicative of either impaired normal 
liver function or tumor status, correlated with a higher incidence of liver-related 
serious adverse events in clinical trials.
A retrospective  study of 121 patients from 5 clinical trials has shown that the 
following 5 Pre-treatment High Risk Factors have been associated with at least 
48% of all serious adverse events that were possibly related to use of the device 
and with 11 of the 12 deaths that were possibly related to use of the device:
• infiltrative  tumor type
• “Bulk disease”  (tumor volume > 70% of the target liver volume, or tumor nodules 
too numerous to count)
• AST  or ALT > 5 times ULN
• bilirubin >  2 mg/dL
• tumor  volume > 50% combined with an albumin < 3 g/dL
8.1.10 Nursing  implications
Radioactive products  should be used only by physicians who are qualified by 
specific training in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose 
experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government 
agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides. Adequate shielding and 
precautions for handling radioactive material must be maintained. As in the use of 
any radioactive material, care should be taken to ensure minimum radiation 
exposure to the patient extraneous to the therapeutic objective and to ensure 
minimum radiation exposure to workers and others in contact with the patient.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 44Since adequate studies  have not been performed in animals to determine whether 
this device affects fertility in males or females, has teratogenic potential, or has 
other adverse effects on the fetus, this product should not be administered to 
pregnant or nursing women unless it is considered that the benefits to be gained 
outweigh the potential hazards. Ideally the use of this radioactive device in women 
of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few (approximately 
10) days following the onset of menses. Dose rate to personnel should be 
monitored during administration. Any spills or leaks must be cleaned up 
immediately and the area monitored for contamination at the end of the procedure. 
The TheraSphere dose vial is supplied secured within a clear acrylic vial shield to 
limit radiation exposure to personnel. The dose rate at the vial shield surface is still 
high enough to require caution including the use of tongs and a lead shielded 
container when possible. The TheraSphere dose vial should always be stored in a 
shielded location away from personnel.

9.3.1 Tumor  biopsy immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and analysis for PD-L1, 
PD-1, CD8+ and CD4+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
Detection of  the selected markers for this study will be performed using 
immunohistochemistry. After the staining, the slides will be digitally scanned in an 
Aperio AT system (AperioTM, Leica BiosystemsTM) to convert the IHC slides into 
digital pathology files for posterior analysis. IHC expression analyses of markers 
consider a thorough staining pattern evaluation including distribution (percentage 
of positive cells) and intensity in the form of H-score, and evaluating the IHC 
expression in the proper subcellular location (i.e. membrane, cytoplasm or 
nucleus). IHC analysis and scoring will be performed by a certified pathologist 
using an image analysis software (Image Toolbox, AperioTM). 
Outcome from the  analysis will be calculated according to the H-score. The H-
score ranges from 0 to 300, and it considers both intensity of the IHC (from 0 to 3) 
and distribution (percentage of the target cells positive, from 0 to 100). The scoring 
is the addition of the percentages of cells with intensity 0 + intensity 2 + intensity 
3, thus the addition of the final percentage is 100% and the scoring will range from 
0 to 300. Hence, the H score will incorporate both percentage of positive cells and 
intensity of marker expression. Hematoxylin/eosin and PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2-
stained sections will be reviewed by a pathologist. Criteria to be evaluated include 
histologic subtype and grade, TNM 2002 pathologic tumor stage, the presence and 
type of intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration, and the quantity and location of PD-L1 
staining. The tumor will be considered positive for PD-1, PD- L1, PD-L2 if >5% of 
tumor cells had histologic evidence of plasma membrane staining.
9.3.2 Peripheral  blood lymphocyte phenotypes
Lymphocyte subsets  (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD56) will be analyzed 
according to absolute cell numbers per microliter of whole blood, percent 
representation among all lymphocytes, and co-expression of the activation 
markers CD25, HLA-DR, and CD45RO using automated flow cytometric 
techniques at the Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory, Robert H Lurie Cancer 
Center of Northwestern University under the supervision of Suchitra 
Swaminathan, PhD. 
9.4 Specimen Banking
Patient samples  collected for this study will be retained at the Northwestern University 
Biorepository. Specimens will be stored indefinitely or until they are used up. If future use 
is denied or withdrawn by the patient, best efforts will be made to stop any additional 
studies and to destroy the specimens.
Dr. Aparna Kalyan will  be responsible for reviewing and approving requests for clinical 
specimen from potential research collaborators outside of Northwestern University. 
Collaborators will be required to complete an agreement (a Material Transfer Agreement 
or recharge agreement) that states specimens will only be released for use in disclosed 
research. Any data obtained from the use of clinical specimen will be the property of 
Northwestern University for publication and any licensing agreement will be strictly adhered 
to.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 4810.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Study  Design/Study Endpoints
This is  a single-center Phase I/Ib study aiming to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and 
tolerability of nivolumab combined with therasphere, Y-90, in patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
The expected  number of patients on dose escalation will be in the range of 9-15 based 
on the 3+3 design. Six patients will be treated at the MTD in the dose escalation phase.  
The dose calculation for Yttrium-90 Therasphere will be done according to standard 
protocol at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Please note - details of this are located in 
section 8.1.
 
Phase Ib  Expansion Cohort:
A Simon  two stage optimum Phase II design (1989) will be used to test the null 
hypothesis that the response rate is 10% versus an alternative hypothesis of 30 [36].  Up 
to 29 evaluable patients will be entered into Phase 1b.  The 6 patients at the MTD in 
Phase 1 will be counted as part of the 29 in Phase 1b.  In the first stage, 10 patients will 
be entered.  If none or 1 show a response, then consideration will be given to trial 
termination due to inactivity of the treatment.  If 2 or more of 10 show a response, then an 
additional 19 patients will be added.  If 5 or fewer of 29 show a response, then the trial 
will conclude that the response rate could be as low as 10%.  If 6 or more respond, then 
the trial will conclude that the response rate is greater than 10%.  This design has a 20% 
chance of falsely concluding the rate is 10% (Type II error = 20%), and a 5% chance of 
falsely concluding that the rate is greater than 10% (Type I error = 5%).  There is a 74% 
chance that the trial will show 0 or 1 responses in the first stage if the true response rate 
is 10%.  
For the  total sample size, Phase 1 requires 9-15 patients, Phase 1b requires 29 patients 
in a two-stage optimum Simon design.  The 6 at the MTD in Phase 1 are counted as part 
of the 29.  This would require up to 15 in Phase 1, 23 new patients in Phase 1b for a total 
of 38 patients.  Target accrual is 40 patients to account for potentially unevaluable 
patients.  
Treatment duration:
Treatment will  continue until disease progression (imaging done every 8 weeks), 
intolerable side effects, or patient withdraws consent or is removed from the study for any 
other reason.
10.2 Data  Analyses Plans
Any subject  who has received the investigational combination will be analyzed in an 
intention to treat format. The MTD will be determined as described in Section 4.3.  
Objective response rate (ORR = CR + PR) as defined in Section 6.3.3.1 and disease 
control rate (CR+PR+SD) will be calculated and a 95% confidence interval for response 
will be obtained using the methods of Porcher and Desseaux (2012) [37].  Progression-
free survival will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier product limit curve.  Besides the 
required reporting of adverse events, adverse events will be summarized for all patients 
in the trial by type, duration, severity, timing and attribution (probable cause of adverse 
event).  Whole exome sequencing and computational analyses will be performed to 
assess mutanome and immunome (subpopulations of immune cells).  Change in clonal 
burden landscape of various mutanome and immunome will be analyzed to investigate its 
correlation with treatment response or development of resistance to treatment. 
11.0 STUDY  MANAGEMENT
IRB #: STU00203003-CR0005 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 2/11/2021 through 2/10/2022.
NU Study  Number: NU 16I01
BMS Study Number:  CA 209-615
Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 4911.1 Institutional  Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent 
It is  expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent form and 
protocol.
In obtaining  and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Before recruitment  and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA 
Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been 
provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the 
implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study by signing an IRB approved consent form.
Prior to a  patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be 
signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion.
11.2 Subject  Recruitment and Screening
Subjects will  be recruited through hepatology clinic, hepatocellular carcinoma clinic, pre-
transplant clinic and medical oncology clinics.  They will be identified by the PI, or 
referred to the PI from other hepatologists, transplant surgeons or medical oncologists.  
The PI or sub-investigator will discuss the protocol with potential subjects (patients from 
one of the above clinics) that may qualify for the study based on the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria in this protocol.  If the patient is interested they will discuss the study in depth and 
if they prefer, they can take home information (combination consent/HIPAA form) on the 
study to discuss with their family/significant other/primary care provider.
Once a  potential subject decides they’d like to participate in the study they will come in to 
meet with the research coordinator/PI and/or sub-I to sign the consent after any other 
questions are answered.  It is only after the informed consent is signed that any study-
related procedures can be performed.  The subject will be given a signed copy of the 
informed consent and the consent process will be documented in the subject’s medical 
record.
11.3 Amendments
The Principal  Investigator will formally initiate all amendments to the protocol and/or 
informed consent. All amendments will be subject to the review and approval of the 
appropriate local, institutional, and governmental regulatory bodies, as well as by Bristol-
Meyers Squibb. Amendments will be distributed by the lead institution (Northwestern) to 
all affiliate sites upon approval by the Northwestern University IRB.
11.4 Registration  Procedures
For potential  patients, study teams are asked to inform the QAM of the date and time that 
the patient will need to be registered (croqualityassurance@northwestern.edu).  
BEFORE a  patient can be treated on study, please complete and submit the following 
items to confirm eligibility and receive an identification number:
Patient’s  signed and dated informed consent form (upload to NOTIS and keep 
original hard copy in a secure location/study chart)
Eligibility  checklist (signed and dated by the treating physician – upload to NOTIS)
Eligibility  eCRF (complete in NOTIS)
Copy  of the pathology report (upload to NOTIS)

BMS Study Number:  CA 209-615
Initial Version:  4/19/2016
Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 50The QAM will  review all source documentation required to confirm eligibility that is readily 
available in the patient’s electronic medical record (EMR).  Any information that is not 
available in the EMR must be de-identified and emailed to the QAM. Once the QAM 
confirms the patient is eligible, he or she will register the patient, assign a subject 
identification number, provide a cohort assignment, and send a confirmation of 
registration to involved personnel. Registration will then be complete and the patient may 
begin study treatment. 
11.5 Data  Submission
Once a  subject is confirmed and registered to the study, eCRFs should be submitted 
according to the detailed data submission guidelines (provided in a separate document).  
Generally, all data for phase I patients during the time period patients are evaluated for 
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) must be submitted on a weekly basis. 
11.6 Instructions for  Participating Sites
Before the study  can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be 
provided to the Clinical Research Office at Northwestern University:
Signed  and completed Letter of Invitation to participate in the study.
Signed  copy of Northwestern University’s Data Monitoring Committee policy 
pertaining to data submission.
Draft  informed consent form should for review/approval prior to submission to the 
local IRB
A  copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed consent. 
CVs  and medical licensure for the local PI and any sub-investigators who will be 
involved in the study at the site.
Form  FDA 1572 appropriately filled out and signed with appropriate documentation.

that: 
Is  generally noted or recognized after it occurs.
Has  no substantive effect on the risks to research participants.
Has  no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the 
value of the data collected.
Did  not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s). 
A protocol deviation may  be considered an instance of Promptly Reportable Non-
Compliance (PRNC) if it:
Has  harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research 
participants.
Has  damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.
Results  from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).
Demonstrates  serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, 
State laws, or University policies.
11.9 Investigator  Obligations
The Principal  Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in 
accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The PI is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment of all study 
patients. The PI must assure that all study site personnel, including sub-investigators and 
other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI 
regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.
The Principal  Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all 
the required data will be collected, entered onto the appropriate eCRFs, and submitted 
within the study-specific timeframes. Periodically, monitoring visits may be conducted and 
the Principal Investigator will provide access to his/her original records to permit 
verification of proper entry of data. The study may also be subject to routine audits by the 
Audit Committee, as outlined in the DSMP. 
11.10 Publication  Policy
Neither the  complete nor any part of the results of the study carried out under this protocol, 
nor any of the information provided by the sponsor (Dr. Aparna Kalyan) for the purposes 
of performing the study, will be published or passed on to any third party without the 
consent of Dr. Aparna Kalyan.  Results of this study may be used for teaching, research, 
publications, or presentations at scientific meetings.  
All potential publications  and/or data for potential publications (e.g. manuscripts, articles, 
data, text, diagrams, abstracts, posters, charts, slides, pictures, or clinicaltrials.gov 
releases) must be approved in accordance with the policies and processes set forth in 
the Lurie Cancer Center DSMP. For trials that require high intensity monitoring, the 
assigned QAM will prepare a preliminary data summary (to be approved by the DSMC) 
no later than 3 months after the study reaches its primary completion date (the date that 
the final subject is examined or receives an intervention for the purposes of final data 
collection for the primary endpoint). If the investigator’s wish to obtain DSMC-approved 
data prior to this point (or prior to the point dictated by study design), the PI must send a 
written request for data to the QAM which includes justification. If the request is 
approved, data will be provided no later than 4 weeks after this request approval. The 
data will be presented to the DSMC at their next available meeting, and a final, DSMC-
approved dataset will be released along with any DSMC decisions regarding publication. 
The investigators are expected to use only DSMC-approved data in future publications.

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 56APPENDIX 2:  
Pregnancy and Contraception  Requirements
Investigators shall  counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP  on the 
importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy. Investigators shall 
advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually  active with WOCBP  on the use of highly effective 
methods of contraception from the time of treatment initiation to 5 months (for FOCBP) or 7 months (for 
males with FOCBP partners) after the last dose of nivolumab. Highly  effective methods of contraception 
have a failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
At a minimum, subjects  must agree to the use of two methods of contraception, with one method being 
highly effective and the other  method being either highly effective or less effective as listed below:
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE  METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Male condoms  with spermicide
a)Hormonal methods  of contraception including combined  oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, 
injectables, implants, and intrauterine  devices (IUDs)  such as Mirena® by WOCBP  subject  or 
male subject’s WOCBP partner.  Female partners of male subjects  participating in the study may 
use hormone based contraceptives  as one of the acceptable  methods  of contraception since they 
will not be receiving study drug.
b)Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard®
c)Tubal ligation
d)Vasectomy.
e)Complete Abstinence*
*Complete abstinence is  defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual  intercourse and is an 
acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs.  Subjects who choose  complete abstinence are not 
required to use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must  continue to have 
pregnancy tests.  Acceptable alternate methods  of highly effective contraception must be discussed in 
the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
a) Diaphragm with spermicide
b) Cervical cap with spermicide
c) Vaginal sponge
d) Male Condom without spermicide*
e) Progestin only pills by WOCBP subject or male subject’s WOCBP partner
f) Female Condom*
*A male and female condom must not be used together
Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements. However they must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in this 
section.

originally written with a

mistakenly left in the

level 
-1 was removed.  The 
likelihood of a DLT 
occurring at level 1 is 
low, so further

in this population.”
Secondary objectives  include: “To 
evaluate the proportion of patients 
with ORR to the combination 
treatment nivolumab with Y-90Changes MTD to the  Phase I 
primary objective, and moves 
ORR from a secondary 
objective to the Phase Ib 
primary objective. 
Expands “this  population” to 
state “patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma”. Given that  
nivolumab is FDA-
approved at 
240mg IV, it is 
important to look 
at efficacy as a 
more prominent 
study objective. It 
is also appropriate 
to have a primary 
objective for each 
study phase.

of 6 weeks  will be permitted in 
case of toxicity.Nivolumab treatment  will 
now start 7-14 days after 
Y-90 administration.  A 
delay of 4 weeks will be 
permitted in case of  
toxicity. Also applies to 
cases where Y-90 is 
repeated during the study.Shortening the  window 
allows for patients to be 
treated sooner in a setting 
where treatment is needed 
somewhat urgently. In 
patients treated so far, 
lymphopenia has not been 
an issue which was the 
initial reason for the 4-
week treatment delay. The 
new of window of 7-14 
days is sufficient to 
account for generalized 
fatigue that may occur with 
Y-90 and given the short 
half-life of Y-90, it is out of 
the system.

(Definitions); 
6.3 (Secondary 
Endpoints); Scans were  to take place 
“within 7 days prior to 
starting nivolumab”Scans will  take place “21-
28 days after Y-90 
administration”To align  with new, shorter 
window between Y-90 and 
nivolumab. Scans will still 
occur the same amount of 
time after Y-90, which falls 
after starting nivolumab

Section(s) 
AffectedPrior Version Amendment 5  Changes Rationale
8.2.6 
(Preparation)Listed detailed  instructions for 
preparing nivolumabRemoves specific  
instructions and instead 
refers to most recent 
nivolumab investigator’s 
brochureBMS request;  removing 
specific details allows for 
variance if needed and 
ensures the most recent IB 
is always followed
8.2.9 
(Availability
 and 
Supply)Specified that  nivolumab 
comes cartons of 5 or 10 mLRemoves details  about 
carton sizesBMS request;  removed 
unnecessary details in 
case of variance
8.2.11 (Return 
&
 Retention of 
Study Drug)Included a  column for 
secondary packaging details 
(5-10 vails per carton)_Removes details  about 
secondary packagingBMS request;  removed 
unnecessary details in

Amendment 7:  07/16/2020 734.1.0 (Patient 
Replacement)Stated that  patients who 
cannot start nivolumab within 
6 weeks of Y-90 treatment 
may be replaced.States that  patients who 
cannot start nivolumab 
within 4 weeks of Y-90 
treatment may be replaced.To correct discrepancy; 
language
 now aligns with 
other sections of the 
protocol which state that 
patients must start 
nivolumab within 4 weeks 
of Y-90 treatment.

Synopsis  
Study Title  A randomized, placebo -controlled trial of 13 -cis retinoic acid 
for the treatment of men with olig oasthenoteratozoospermia  
Study 
Phase  II 
Sponsor  National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  
Study  Drug  13-cis retinoic acid  
Objective  Primary Objective :  To d etermine the effect of 13-cis 
retino ic acid administration  on total motile sperm  count  in 
men with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia  
 
Approach: Sixty men with infertility due to 
oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (total, motile sperm count of 
<10 million), but not known genetic abnormalities, will be 
enrolled in a prospective six -month, randomi zed, double -
blinded, placebo -controlled 3-arm pilot trial of daily oral 
therapy with placebo, 20 or 40 mg daily of 13 -cis retinoic 
acid. The impact of treatment on spermatogenesis will be 
determined by monthly semen analysis.  
 
Secondary Objectives : 
 To determine the chance of pregnancy during treatment 
with 13 -cis retinoic acid  
 To determine the concentration of 13 -cis retinoic acid in 
the seminal plasma of treated men  
 To determine the side effects associated with treatment 
with 13 -cis retinoic acid  
 
Princi pal 
Investigator  Dr. John K. Amory MD, MPH  
Rationale  Men with infertility and normal gonadotropins have few 
options for treatment.  Recent research has demonstrated the 
lower intratesticular concentrations of 13 -cis retinoic acid 
are associated with abnor mal sperm parameters.  Older 
studies of 13 -cis retinoic acid administration to normal men 
demonstrated increases in sperm concentrations, but the 
effect of 13 -cis retinoic acid on sperm concentrations in men 
with infertility has never been studied.  If 13 -cis retinoic 
acid increased sperm concentrations in infertile men, it 
could help infertile men father pregnancies without the need 
for IVF and/or ICSI.

Study  
Design  This is a prospective, randomized, double -blinded , trial to 
evaluate 13-cis retinoic aci d  for the treatment of 
oligoasthenoteratozoospermia   
 
We will conduct a prospective, three -arm, randomized, 
double -blinded, placebo -controlled interventional trial to 
determine the impact of therapy with 13 -cis retinoic acid on 
sperm indices in infertile men. Sixty (n=20/group) i nfertile 
men with abnormal sperm analyses will be enrolled in a 24-
week study of 20mg or 40 mg of 13 -cis retinoic acid or 
matching placebo daily. The subjects will be closely 
followed for side effects related to treatment. The impa ct of 
treatment on indices of spermatogenesis  will be determined 
by monthly seminal fluid analyses . 
 
All aspects of this study will be performed in compliance 
with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations, ICH 
guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and u nder an FDA 
Investigational New Drug (IND) application.  
Number of 
Subjects  Sixty men.  
Duration of 
Trial  Enrolment  should be completed in about 12 months, 
resulting in total study duration of about 24 months 
including screening, treatment phase, end of st udy visit 
procedures, close out and data analysis.  
Duration of 
Treatment  The active treatment phase will be 24 weeks  
Dosage and 
Regimen  13-cis retinoic acid at 20 or 40 mg daily or matching 
placebo  
Inclusion 
Criteria  Subjects will be infertile men (no p regnancy with partner with 
normal cycles and normal hysterosalpingogram despite >1 year of 
unprotected intercourse) and abnormal sperm analyses with a 
total, motile sperm count of less than 10 million sperm as 
assessed by semen analysis on two occasions se parated by one 
week  
Exclusion 
Criteria  Exclusion criteria include: known genetic infertility (e.g. 
Klinefelter syndrome or Y -chromosome microdeletions), 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (that might respond to 
gonadotropin injections), the use of anabolic ste roids, illicit 
drugs, or the consumption of more than 4 alcoholic beverages 
daily, severe mental health problems, or current therapy with 
retinoic acid (e.g. Accutane) or vitamin A.

 Efficacy 
Parameters  In this study, count of total, motile sperm after 24 weeks of 
treatment.  
Safety 
Parameters   CBC, clinical chemistry panel (glucose, liver and renal 
function tests including urea, creatinine, albumin, alanine 
aminotransfera se, aspartate aminotransferase , alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin), full lipid panel incl uding Total 
cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglycerides  at screening and at the 
end of treatment.  Additional measures will be conducted if 
any abnormal values are found until the end of study visit.

 Serum samples will be collected for the measurement of 
concentrations of vitamin A, all -trans and 13 -cis retinoic 
acid, testosterone, FSH and LH  will be collected before the 
beginning of the treatment, and monthly  during treatment.   
Other 
Assessments  Demographic characteri stics, including age and race, will be 
collected  
Statistical 
Analysis  The primary endpoint is the effect  of treatment on the count 
of total, motile sperm between treatment groups after 24 
weeks.  This analysis will be conducted using a Kruskal -
Wallis ANOV A is the primary endpoint.

1.0  Introduction and Backgroun d 
 
 Infertility affects 10 -15% of all couples, with 1.5 million couples seeking 
medical assistance for infertility yearly (1). Infertility attributable to the male 
partner accounts for 30 -40% of all cases of infertility. The most common form of 
male infertility involves some type of impairment in spermatogenesis (2).  
Unfortunately, over 80% of men with infertility from impaired spermatogenesis 
do not have a medically treatable cause, such as a go nadotropin deficiency (3).  In 
men with idiopathic infertility, surgical sperm extraction from the testis coupled 
with in vitro  fertilization or intra -cytoplasmic sperm injection offers some hope 
of fertility; however, these procedures are invasive, expens ive, unsuccessful in 
30-40% of cases, and don’t address the underlying cause of infertility (4).   
Therefore, new approaches to the treatment of male infertility are sorely needed.  
 
 The essential role of vitamin A (retinol) in spermatogenesis has been long  
appreciated.  Vitamin A deficient male mice are sterile due to impaired 
spermatogenesis and supplementation of deficient mice with vitamin A restores 
fertility (5, 6).  Vitamin A is required for spermatogenesis as it is converted to 
retinoic acid in the s eminiferous tubules via the activity of testes -specific retinol 
and retinal dehydrogenases . Retinoic acid is known to mediate most of the effects 
of vitamin A in tissues.  In the testes, two retinoic acid receptors,  and , are 
present in both Sertoli cel ls and developing germ cells (7 -10), and targeted 
deletion of these receptors in mice results in male infertility (11 -13).  From this 
work, it is clear that retinoic acid plays several essential roles in spermatogenesis, 
including necessary functions in sp ermatogonial differentiation, spermatid 
adhesion to Sertoli cells and spermiation (14). Given the crucial role of retinoic 
acid in spermatogenesis, it seems quite possible that some men with “idiopathic” 
infertility have intratesticular concentrations of r etinoic acid below those 
necessary to initiate and/or maintain optimal spermatogenesis, but whether 
relative deficiencies of intratesticular retinoic acid contribute to male infertility in 
   
10 
 humans is unknown.   In theory, poor dietary intake of vitamin A cou ld lead to 
infertility; however, a nutritional cause of infertility seems improbable in the US.  
More likely, low intratesticular concentrations of retinoic acid could occur in 
infertile men either due to impaired retinoic acid biosynthesis from vitamin A or 
increased metabolism of retinoic acid to inactive metabolites within the testes.   
 
 Despite the known importance of retinoic acid for spermatogenesis in animals, there has 
been relatively little work examining the role of retinoic acid on spermatogene sis in 
humans.  In this proposal, we will perform a clinical trial of retinoic acid administration to 
infertility patients to determine whether retinoic acid therapy improves sperm quality in 
infertile men.  Intriguingly, there is a suggestion that the adm inistration of retinoic acid to 
men may improve sperm production. During the development of 13 -cis retinoic acid 
(Accutane) for acne, three human studies examining the effect of oral administration of 13 -
cis-retinoic acid on sperm production in men were pe rformed to determine if 13 -cis 
retinoic acid was harmful to male fertility. Interestingly, men in these studies had increased 
sperm concentrations during treatment (see below), suggesting that 13 -cis retinoic acid 
administration enhanced spermatogenesis in  these normal men with acne (15 -17).  
 
 If the administration of retinoic acid were shown to improve spermatogenesis in some 
infertile  men, it would have tremendous significance for our current approach to the 
treatment of male infertility .  Because of its  widespread use in humans for over 25 years, 
13-cis retinoic acid is widely available in a generic formulation and could be quickly 
incorporated into male infertility treatment algorithms.  Ideally, retinoic acid therapy 
would increase an infertile man’s c hances of successfully fathering a pregnancy without 
the need for assisted reproductive technologies such as intra -cytoplasmic sperm injection 
and/or surgical methods of sperm extraction that are invasive for both the man and the 
woman, expensive and fail in many of cases.  
 
 Our group has completed the first ever study in humans to examine intratesticular 
retinoic acid concentrations.  With IRB approval, we enrolled 24 men having scrotal 
surgery in an observational study to examine the association between i ntratesticular 
   
11 
 retinoids and spermatogenesis. Interestingly, we observed that intratesticular 13 -cis 
retinoic acid is significantly lower in men with sub -normal sperm quality as compared to 
men with normal sperm quality as defined by the WHO criteria ( 18) (Figure 1).

13-cis-retinoic acid is significantly lower in men with sub -normal sperm quality as compared to men 
with normal sp erm analyses (p=0.04) (41).
This data suggests that lower intratesticular retinoic acid is associated with impaired 
spermatogenesis; however, it is unclear from this cross -sectional data if the low retinoic acid is a 
result of the infertility or a cause o f it.  Only an interventional trial of retinoic acid in infertile men 
will answer the question of the ability of retinoic acid to improve spermatogenesis in this 
population.

12 of 32  Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective :   
To determine the effect of 13 -cis retinoic a cid administration on total motile sperm count 
in men with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia  
 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives : 
 
o To determine the chance of pregnancy during treatment with 13 -cis retinoic acid  
o To determine the concentration of 13 -cis retinoic acid in the seminal plasma of 
treated men  
o To determine the side effects and tolerability of  treatment with 13 -cis retinoic acid  
 
3. Rationale, Benefits and Risks  
Male infertility is common and difficult to treat unless men have an easily identified 
gonadotropin deficie ncy.  Many men have idiopathic infertility.  Retinoids are necessary 
for spermatogenesis, but no controlled studies of retinoic acid administration to men with 
infertility have been conducted.  We have shown that men with abnormal spermatogenesis 
have lowe r than normal levels of intratesticular retinoic acid, suggesting that intratesticular 
retinoic acid deficiency is associated with infertility.  In this study, we aim to determine if 
retinoic acid therapy can improve sperm counts in men with low sperm coun ts.  The 
medication, 13 -cis retinoic acid is widely available and prescribed for the treatment of 
acne, suggesting  that serious adverse events , especially at the low doses to be tested  are 
unlikely.  
 
4. Compliance

15 of 32 Concomitant medications are discouraged except as prescribed for the treatment of intercurrent 
medical conditions. All concomitant treatments will be recorded on t he subject’s case record form 
(CRF), including the generic name of the drug, start and stop dates, and reason for use.   
 
11. Study  Materials  
11.1 Study Medication  
Each subject will receive the study medication assigned per the randomization list. The first dose 
will be administered  at the clinic under the observation of the study staff. The day and time of the 
start of treatment will be recorded on the CRF in the appropriate space provided. The subjects will 
be given enough supply of medication (for 2 8 days) until their next visit.  
 
Study medication log (diary) will be provided to the subjects for recording the time of application 
of gel. These medication logs will be reviewed at each visit. The investigator will retain the copies 
of these logs.  
 
11.2 Storage  
Study med ications will be stored at a temperature not to exceed 25 C in a locked storage area at 
the study site. Study medication will be accessible only to study personnel designated to handle 
study medication.  
 
11.3 Disposal  
Empty used pill bottles  will be returned to  the clinic and retained at the site .   All unused 
medication will be returned to the University of Washington investigational pharmacy  for 
destruction  once final drug ac countability has been performed.  
 
12. Study  Procedures  
12.1 General  
 There will be a total of three treatment groups as described in Section 7. The study will consist of 
3 periods:  
1. Pre-treatment period (including screening) for up to 60 days . 
2. Treatment period for 24 weeks

16 of 32 3. Recovery period for about 12 weeks  
 
The treatment period will begin with Day 1  of treatment, daily for 24  weeks. The recov ery period 
will last for about 12  weeks.  
 
12.2 Laboratory Samples  
Blood samples for laboratory analyses will be collected at the two screening visit s, Day 1 and at 
the treatment visits every four weeks with the subjec t in a fasting state (no food or drink other than 
4 to 6 ounces of water or non -sweetened clear liquids for a minimum of 10 hours). If the subject is 
in a non -fasting state, the investigator will reschedule the visit within two days. The investigator 
will review all laboratory reports and file a copy with each subject’s chart and CRFs. The CBC  
and blood chemistry samples  will be analysed at the local hospital laboratory at the University of 
Washington.    
 
The serum samples for measurements of retinoic acid  will be frozen for analysis  at the end of 
study  to prevent inadvertent breaking of the blind . Briefly, the blood samples will be collected into 
vacutainers (containing serum separating tube gel and clo t activator) and gently mixed. After 
wrapping in alumi num foil to prevent light exposure that can degrade retinoic acid, s amples will 
be allowed to clot for 1 -2 hours at room temperature before centrifugation at 1000 -2000g for 15 
minutes. Following centrifugation, the serum samples will be frozen at –20 C.   
 
 
12.3 Visits in Pre -treatment period  
 
All visits will be scheduled between 9:00am and  5:00pm.

17 of 32 12.3.1  Screening Visit  
The following screening procedures will be performed at  the screening  visit:  
 Each participant must sign an IRB -approved informed consent form befor e any of the study -
related procedures can be performed. The original signed informed consent form will be kept on 
file by the investigator with the subject’s record and a signed copy will be given to the subject.  
 A screening number will be assigned . 
 A gene ral medical history will be taken and will incl ude information on current and previous 
diseases and treatment.

13. Study Withdrawals  
Subjects withdrawing from the study can be replaced only if the withdraw al occurs before the start 
of the treatment. Subjects who have had medication will not be replaced, regardless of the reason 
for discontinuation. All efforts should be made to contact any subject who decides to discontinue 
study participation for the end o f study safety procedures (Visit 9). The necessary clinical and 
laboratory examinations planned at the last visit should be performed at the end of the study 
whenever it occurs. The reasons for discontinuation will be documented.   
 
13-cis RA for OAT                                    Confidential                              
            
20 of 32 Post-Admission Withdraw al Criteria  
Subjects may be discontinued prematurely for any of the following reasons:  
 Emergence of a severe condition(s) such that, in the judgment of the investigator, continuation 
in the trial would negatively impact the health of the subject.  
 Personal reasons ( e.g. withdrawn consent).  
 Subject lost to follow -up 
 
All subjects in a treatment arm may be discontinued prematurely if greater than 25% of the 
subjects in an arm are discontinued for the emergence of the same severe condition that requires 
individ ual subjects to be discontinued.   
 
14. Statistical  Considerations  
 
Data analysis and Interpretation of Results:  The primary endpoint is the count of total motile spermatozoa in 
the ejaculate at week 24 of treatment compared with baseline.  Secondary endpoint s include other changes in 
sperm quality, and any pregnancies occurring during treatment as well as the incidence of side effects.   The 
number of total motile sperm after six months of treatment will be compared between the three groups using a 
Kruskal -Wallis ANOVA with a Wilcoxon rank -sum post -hoc test.  The change in the total motile sperm count 
from baseline (a secondary endpoint) will be performed with a Wilcoxon sign -rank test.  Linear regression will be 
performed to determine if significant relations hips between baseline (or delta) retinoic concentrations and changes 
in sperm quality are present using STATA Version 10.0 (College Park, TX, USA).  For all comparisons, an alpha 
of 0.05 will be considered significant.  
 
14.1 Sample size consideration  
Inclusion  of 20 men per group will allow for an 80% power to detect a greater than a 20% difference for total 
motile sperm count at week 24 compared with placebo with a variance of 25% and allowing for a drop -out rate of 
10% at an alpha of 0.05.  
 
14.2 Efficacy  
Primary :  The primary efficacy outcome is increase in the count of total, motile sperm a fter 
twenty -four weeks of study treatment.

21 of 32 Secondary: The magnitude and changes between baseline and week 24 in terms of total, motile 
sperm count  will be described for subje cts in each trea tment arm.  
 
14.3 Safety  
Laboratory data, physical examination results, vital signs and chemistry levels  will be assessed 
and compared for each subject from screening to end of study.  All adverse events will be 
recorded and coded using the body  system coding of MedDRA.  
 
The incidence of adverse events will be examined by dose and where appropriate for trend by 
subject, clinic and time, using descriptive statistics.  Clinical chemistries and allied d ata will be 
examined for change over time.  
 
15. Adverse  Events  
Adverse Events (AE) should be carefully monitored and an AE form is included in the CRF. 
Serious adverse events (SAE) as defined below will have to be reported on the SAE form included 
as an appendix.  
 
All adverse experiences must be recorded  in the study event record of the subject’s CRF, and must 
include the following information (when applicable):  
 Specific condition or event  
 Indication of whether the condition was pre -existing or not and if yes, whether it has worsened 
in severity (includin g an increase in frequency)  
 Date of occurrence  
 Date of resolution  
 Relationship to study medication as evaluated by the investigator (causality assessment). The 
investigator must enter their opinion of causality on the AE forms.  
 Action taken (study medicat ion continued or not) and outcome  
 Seriousness according to the approved regulatory classification {i.e. any event that is  fatal, 
life-threatening, disabling, incapacitating, results in or prolongs hospitalization, or is a medically 
significant event, e.g . an intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes, or any other serious 
criteria (cancer, congenital anomaly, overdose, other significant) is considered serious}.

22 of 32 When any serious adverse drug experience, regardless of causality, is encountered durin g 
this clinical trial at an investigator’s site, the investigator must notify the Study Monitor  by 
facsimile using the form provided as an appendix. This report must be submitted within 2 
calendar days from the time the investigator’s staff is notified of the event.  
 
All serious adverse events that are unexpected will be reported to the FDA by the principal 
investigator or his designated surrogate . All serious adverse events will be followed until fully 
characterized.  The investigator will collect and for ward to the FDA  via fax, all available 
supporting documentation (with subject name redacted) for serious events, including at a 
minimum hospital discharge summaries and death certificates (where applicable). Additional 
supporting documentation that should be collected whenever possible, to verify the medical 
diagnosis, includes autopsy reports (where applicable), surgical procedure summaries, histology 
reports, and imaging reports.  
 
16. Ethical  Considerations  
16.1 Informed Consent  
Principal investigators will provid e the NICHD with a copy of the Informed Consent approved by 
their local Institutional Review Board (IRB). The appended Informed Consent (Appendix 2 and 
Appendix 3) will be translated and certified into  the language of the respondent as needed.  
 
Under this consent, the subject shall understand that he is authorizing access to medical records as 
required for monitors, auditors, IRBs and regulatory authorities. To expedite collection of 
supporting documentation in the event of a serious adverse event, the subj ect should also be asked 
to provide a release of medical records authorization at the enrollment visit.  
 
16.2 Conflicts of Interest  
The investigators will not profit from results, either positive or negative, with regard to the 
product being evaluated.

Name of Active Ingredients:  
Bupivacaine and meloxicam  Phase of Development: 2b 
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective s: 
 To compare the e fficacy and duration of analgesia achieved following periarticular  infiltration of HTX -011 with 
that of saline placebo in subjects undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  
Secondary Objectives:  
 To compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia for HTX -011 with that of bupivacaine HCl without 
epinephrine in this study population.  
 To evaluate additional efficacy parameters , including opioid load,  in this study population.  
 To evaluate the efficacy and duration of analgesia for HTX -011 administered using different techniques in this 
study population.  
 To characterize the bupivacaine and meloxicam pharmacokinetic (PK) profile s following administration of  
HTX -011 in this study population.  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of HTX -011 in this study p opulation.  
Methodology : This is a Phase  2b, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, multicenter 
study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA.  Cohort 1 will evaluate HTX -011 administered into the 
surgical site via different techniques compared with saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl to determine whether to 
proceed to Cohort 2 . If a decision is made to proceed to Cohort 2, HTX -011 will be evaluated compared with saline 
placebo and bupivacaine HCl at the dose and administration technique recommended by an internal Interim R eview 
Committee  (IRC) . 
All s ubjects will be screened within 21 days prior to surgery . Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria 
will be randomiz ed. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery . On the day of 
surgery (Day  0), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will undergo primary unilateral TKA under 
general anesthesia .  
Just b efore being taken to the operating room prior to the start of surgery, each subject in Cohort 2 will be 
administered pregabalin orally (PO; 150 mg) and acetaminophen intravenously (IV ; no more than 1  g [1000  mg] in a 
6-hour window , as per the approved prescribing information ) to reduce initial  postoperative pain.  
In the study, a single dose of study drug (HTX -011 with or without  ropivacaine, bupivacaine HCl without 
epinephrine, or saline placebo) will be administered intraoperatively by infiltration  to the surgical site ( eg, 
periarticular  instillation , periarticular  injection, or a combination of periarticular  injection and instillation ). 
Specifically i n Cohort 2, HTX -011 will be administered via periarticular instillation with or without ropivacaine  via 
periarticular injection . 
During surgery, the use of fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg will be permitted for intraoperative pain control. Just prior to the 
end of the surgery, all subjects will receive an additional 75 µg of fentanyl IV to minimize the variability of the 
impact of fentanyl o n postoperative care (for example , the maximu m total amount of fentanyl used during surgery 
for a 70 kg subject should not exceed 355 µg [4 μg/kg × 70 kg = 280 μg for intraoperative pain control + 75  μg at 
the end of the case = 355 μg total] ).  
Following s urgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit 
(PACU) . Subjects will remain in the hospital /research facility  for a minimum of 72  hours after study drug

administration  to undergo postoperative assessments . After the 72 -hour assessments have been completed, subjects 
may be discharged . Subjects will return to the study site on Day s 10 and 28 to complete follow -up assessments.  
Postoperative Opioid Rescue Medications  
Subjec ts should only receive rescue medication upon request for pain control, as needed, during the 72 -hour 
postoperative observation period. Rescue medication should not be given for pain prophylaxis, but only for pain 
treatment. Prior to the administration of the first dose of rescue medication, if the subject has not already had at least 
1 postoperative pain score assessed, then a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at rest (NRS -R) followed by a 
Numeric Rating Scale score with activity (NRS -A) pain score must be obtained.  
Postoperative rescue medication will consist of IV morphine and/or PO immediate -release oxycodone. For the first 
2 hours in the PACU, the subject may receive up to 15  mg IV morphine , as needed. Thereafter, the subject may 
receive up to 10 mg in a 2 -hour period, as needed. In addition, the subject may also receive up to 10 mg of PO 
immediate -release oxycodone  within any 4 -hour period , as needed , from after study drug administration thr ough 
72 hours . No other analgesic agents  are permitted during the 72 -hour postoperative observation period (except as 
specified by the protocol ; see below).  
After 72  hours, the analgesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually as deemed appr opriate by the 
physician responsible for the postoperative care and in accordance with the verbal discharge instructions. See the 
Study Reference Manual for more information on postoperative pain management after discharge.  Subjects will 
complete a daily d iary to record if they take an opioid medication between 72 hours and Day 28.  
Required Antifibrinolysis  and Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) Prophylaxis  
All subjects are required to receive tranexamic acid ( TXA ) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) during the study. TXA 1g 
IV will be administered prior to the start of surgery and a second dose will be administered  up to approximately 
8 hours later. For the time period after study drug administration until hospital discharge, subjects should receive 
ASA 325 mg PO twice a day ; surgeons may also use additional DVT prophylaxis as per their standard of care.  
Use of Other Analgesics  
With the exception of preoperative administration of PO pregabalin  and IV acetaminophen  (in Cohort 2 only) , 
intraoperative adm inistration of study drug  (including ropivacaine in 1 arm in Cohort 2)  and fentanyl, 
protocol -specified postoperative opioid rescue medications, and ASA for DVT prophylaxis , no other analgesic 
agents, including ketamine and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are permitted from the time the 
subject signs  the informed consent form ( ICF) through 72  hours  after study drug administration , except under the 
following circumstances: to treat an adverse event (AE), for pretreatment prior to  needle placement, or to decrease 
venous irritation caused by propofol (in which case, no more than a single administration of lidocaine 1% 20  mg IV 
may be administered). Nerve block may also not be used as a form of analgesia on Day 0 and for at least 72  hours 
after study drug administration.  
Interim Analyses  
An internal IRC will review unblinded, summary -level efficacy, safety, and P K data from Cohort 1 to determine if 
enrollment should be initi ated in Cohort 2 . The interim analysis will be performed afte r at least 80% of the planned 
number of subjects in Cohort 1 have all of their pain intensity and opioid use data through the 72 -hour postoperative 
assessments entered into electronic clinical database.  The IRC will operate under a written, detailed IRC Charter . 
There will be no interim analyses on data collected during Cohort 2.  
Treatment Cohorts  
The study will include 2 cohorts.

Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy Analyses:  
Cohorts 1 and 2 will be analyzed separately with no data pooling across cohorts. In Cohort 1, each arm of HTX -011 
will be tested against each control arm. In Cohort 2, the following treatment comparisons will be performed in a 
hierarchical order for the primary and key secondary endpoint s: 
1. Mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  (13.7 mL) via periarticular 
instillation and ropivacaine 50 mg via periarticular injection vs. saline placebo . 
2. Mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  (13.7 mL) via periarticular 
instillation vs. saline placebo . 
3. Mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  (13.7 mL) via periarticular 
instillation and ropivacaine 50 mg via periarticular injection vs. saline placebo . 
4. Mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  (13.7 mL) via periarticular 
instillation vs.  saline  placebo . 
In order to account for multiple treatment comparisons on the primary and key secondary endpoint s in Cohort 2, a 
strict testing hierarchy will be applied to control study -wise alpha level at 0.05. If the first treatment comparison is 
statisticall y significant (p≤0.05), then the second  treatment comparison will be tested. If the second  treatment 
comparison is statistically significant, then the third  treatment comparison will be tested. Sequential testing will 
continue in this manner down the hiera rchical order until a treatment comparison fails to meet statistical 
significance, after which all subsequent treatment comparisons will be considered exploratory.   
The primary endpoint of mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores will be analyzed using an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as th e main effect. Results will be expressed as mean AUCs and standard 
deviations  (SDs), least -squares mean differences and standard errors (SEs) with assoc iated 95% co nfidence intervals 
(CIs), and p -values. Other continuous efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the primary endpoint.  
Categorical endpoints will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Results will be expressed as the number and 
percen tage of subjects meeting the relevant endpoint, differences in proportions with 95% CIs, and p -values.  
Median time in hours to first opioid rescue administration will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methods.  
Safety Analyses:  
All safety data will be listed a nd summarized by treatment group ; no statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. 
All TEAEs will be coded and tabulated by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs

will be summarized and presented in descending order of frequ ency accor ding to the highest dose of HTX -011 
studied. Associated laboratory parameters such as hepatic profile, renal function, and hematology values will be 
grouped and presented together in summary tables . Individual subject values will be listed and va lues outside of the 
standard reference range will be flagged. Changes in vital sign parameters will be summarized.  
Interim Analysis : 
One interim analys is is planned  for Cohort 1 . An internal IRC will review unblinded , summary -level data from 
Cohort 1 to make study design decisions . The interim analysis will be performed after at least 80% of the planned 
number of subjects in Cohort 1 have all of their pain intensity and opioid use data through the 72 -hour postoperative 
assessments entered into electron ic clinical database . The internal IRC will be composed of 1  Sponsor representative 
from the Clinical Research, Biometrics, Pharmacovigilance, Regulatory, and Pharmaceutical and Translational 
Sciences functions. The IRC will operate under a written, detail ed IRC Charter.  
There will be no interim analyses on data collected during Cohort 2.  
Determination of Sample Size : 
Cohort 1: The sample size of up to approximately 60 subjects was selected empirically without formal statistical 
assumptions.  
Cohort 2: The mean (SD) AUC 0-48 in the  saline  placebo and HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  groups after adjusting for 
opioid rescue medication use is expected to be approximately 425 (90) and 365 (90) , respectively. Using a 2 -sample 
t-test, 50 subjects per treatment group results i n approximately 90% power to detect a statistically signif icant 
treatment effect with α  = 0.05, 2 -sided.

* The s tart of study drug administration will be considered as Time  0 for all efficacy, safety, and PK assessments. The start of HTX -011 administration will be considered 
as Time 0 whether or not administered with ropivacaine. For assessments at timepoints when t he subject is asleep, an attempt should be made to wake the subject. If there 
is no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as “Not Done.” Assessments that can be done without awake ning the subject (eg, blood collection for 
PK sample)  should be completed. See Section  6 for more information on study procedures and assessments.  
a Subjects who withdraw from the study before their D ay 28 Visit will be asked to complete Early Termination procedures. 
b Result must be negative and confirmed prior to initiation of surgery. A subject who fails the drug test may be rescreened at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects 
with a positive drug screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive drug test (eg, amphetamine  and dextroamphetamine for 
attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder) may be eligible for parti cipation in the study. Subjects taking medical marijuana are not 
allowed to participate in the study. 
c Includes height, weight, and BMI calculation.  
d Only if subject withdraws prior to 72  hours. 
e Only if subject withdraws prior to Day 10.  
f Only if subj ect withdraws prior to Day 28.  
g Subjects will be required to have continuous reading of the Holter monitor at least 24  hours before surgery. If a Holter monitor safety alert is received after study drug 
administration, obtain vital sign measurements and c ollect a blood sample for PK analysis to evaluate for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST).  
h Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior  to study drug administration. Subject 
does not need to be present for randomization to occur.  
i Hematology at 24  hours; hematology and serum chemistry at all other timepoints.  
j Each subject in Cohort 2 will be given a single, oral dose of pregabalin 150 mg prior to the start of surgery.  
k TXA 1 g IV will be administered prior to the start of surgery. A second dose will be administered up to approximately 8 hours  after the initia l dose.  
l Each subject in Cohort 2 will be administered a single dose of acetaminophen IV ( no more than 1 g [1000  mg] in a 6 -hour window , as per the approved prescribing 
information ) prior to the start of surgery.  
m NRS -R should be assessed while the subject is either seated comfortably or lying down.  
n NRS -A assessments should be performed after NRS -R. The prescribed activity for NRS -A is a straight leg raise of the surgical leg while the subject is lying down or 
seated in a recliner (recumbent). If the subject cannot perform the activity, the NRS should still be completed.  
o Defined as the ability to walk more than 3  steps with an assisted device. 
p This study instrument assesses a subject’s potential readiness to b e discharged and should be repeated at all scheduled timepoints. It is not meant to be used to decide on 
whether or not to discharge a subject from the study. Discharge readiness assessments will be repeated for any subject who re mains hospitalized at 96 a nd 120  hours. 
q Wound healing assessments will be repeated for any subject who remains hospitalized at 96 and 120  hours. 
r If a cardiac or neurological treatment -emergent adverse event occurs during the study, a blood sample should be collected at the time  that the event is noted  to determine 
the plasma  bupivacaine concentration.  
s A PK sample should be collected 30  minutes (±5  min) after the start of study drug administration even if the subject is still in the operating room.  
t PK samples may be collected  by a visiting nurse or at the study site.  
u Subjects will complete a daily diary to record use of opioids for pain from 72 hours through Day 28.  
v At the Screening Visit, ensure subject is not taking any prohibited medications. Record all medications tak en between the day of signing the Informed Consent Form 
and Day  28. 
w Adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signs the Informed Consent Form through Day  28.

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background Information  and Study Rationale  
It is estimated that up to 80% of patients suffer from moderate to severe  pain during the first 
24 to 48  hours after surgery  (Gan, 2014 ). Conseque ntly, many are given narcotic analgesics for 
pain management . Administering a local anesthetic is a relatively simple and safe means of 
providing postoperative pain relief and promoting a quicker recovery; however, a major 
limitation of local anesthetics i s their short duration of effect (6  to 12  hours following surgery) 
(Kehlet, 2011 ). The development of an extended -releas e local anesthetic that would provide pain 
relief during this critical postoperative  timeframe and reduce the need for narcotics would be of 
clinical significance .  
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) have long been used in the treatment of 
posto perative pain (Moote, 1992 ), and there is evidence that there may be a synergistic 
interaction between local anesthetics and NSAIDs when locally administered together (Ortiz, 
2011 ). 
Heron is developing HTX -011 for the management of postoperative pain . HTX -011 is an 
extended -release, fixed -ratio combination product that contains bupivacaine ( a local anesthetic as 
the free base) and low -dose meloxicam (an NSAID ) incorporate d in a bioerodible polymer 
(termed Biochronomer) . When HTX -011 is administered, the polymer undergoes controlled 
hydrolysis  in the tissue  resulting in the extended release of bupivacaine and meloxicam . The 
extended release is achieved using a proprietary v ehicle formulation consisting of the novel 
tri[ethylene glycol] -based poly[orthoester] polymer (AP135) in combination with different 
excipients approved for human use (dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol triacetate [ triacetin], and maleic 
acid) . 
This is a Phase  2b, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, multicenter 
study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to evaluate the 
analgesic efficacy, safety, a nd pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX -011 administered via infiltration  
to the surgical site . Cohort 1 will evaluate HTX -011 administered into the surgical site via 
different techniques compared with saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl to determine whether to 
proceed to Cohort 2 . If a decision is made to proceed  to Cohort 2 , HTX -011 will be evaluated 
compared with saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl  at the dose and administration technique 
recommended by an internal Interim R eview Committee  (IRC) . 
1.2. Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups  
TKA is an accept ed model of postoperative pain . TKA produces generally reliable and persistent 
pain symptoms for a p eriod typically lasting longer than 72 hours from the surgery, which allows 
for analysis of acute analgesia over an extended period of time . Nonclinical studies with 
HTX -011 demonst rated a lack of adverse effect s on bone healing , supporting the appropriateness  
of TKA as a model  for clinical evaluation . The compatibility of HTX -011 with polymethyl 
methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement was also studied (Simplex® HV with Genta micin from 
Stryker  and Palacos® R from Zimmer). A range of tests were performed on cylinders of both 
types of cement exposed to HTX -011 in vitro to determine the effect that HTX -011 had on cured 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 23 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  cement. Tests included compression testing, sur face hardness, molecular weight determination 
by gel permeation chromatography , and  identification and quantification of leachable  
component s. Based on the results of this study, the mechanical properties of PMMA bone 
cement are not affected by HTX -011. Th e compressive strength, surface hardness, and molecular 
weight of PMMA bone cement were not changed by the presence of HTX -011. The only 
leachables observed were components from the bone cement known to leach into interstitial fluid 
in vivo.  Consistent wit h published studies, these compounds were observed at 
microgram/ milliliter  concentrations; concentrations that are well below levels that would present 
a toxicity concern. Therefore, HTX -011 should not affect the mechanical properties of bone 
cement provid ed it is administered as described in Section 5.5, avoiding placement of the drug 
between the bone, the implant, and the cement where it could pote ntially interfere with the 
space -filling properties of the cement.  
Wound infiltration is an effective method of pain management in TKA, and the technique for 
administration is described and reviewed in multiple articles  (Busch, 2006 ; Essving, 2010 ; Affas, 
2011 ; Surdam, 2015 ). In this study, HTX -011 will be administered via infiltration  to the surgical 
site (eg, periarticular  instillation , periarticular  injection, or a combination of periarticular  
injection and instillation ) to compare different administration techniques . In Cohort 2, HTX -011 
will be administered  with or without ropivacaine . Bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine and 
saline pla cebo will be used as active  control  and placebo control , respectively, for efficacy and 
safety evaluations .  
Single dose s of HTX -011 up to  400 mg/12 mg , inclusive  (based on bupivacaine dose) , will be 
evaluated in the study . Doses up to 600  mg/18 mg  have  been evaluated in previous HTX -011 
clinical studies . A Phase  1, saline placebo -controlled study evaluated si ngle doses of 
100 mg/3  mg, 200 mg/6 mg , and 400  mg/12 mg  of HTX -011 administered to healthy volunteers 
via subcutaneous (SC) injection . All doses w ere well tolerated, and t herapeutically relevant 
plasma bupivaca ine levels were sustained for 2  to 3 days in the absence of the large initial peak 
observed with commercially  available formulations of the drug  (bupivacaine HCl) . The analgesic 
effects of HTX -011 persi sted through 96  hours, which closely correlated with plasma 
bupivacaine concentrations . HTX -011 d oses up to 600  mg/18 mg have also been administered  in 
concluded and ongoing Phase  2 studies ; current data show that they  have been  generally well 
tolerated . 
The 28-day duration of postoperative assessments is considered appropriate for determining the 
acute analgesic effect -time curve, safety, and PK profiles for HTX -011. 
One interim analys is is planned for Cohort 1 . An internal IRC will review unblinded , 
summary -level efficacy, safety, and PK data from Cohort 1 to make study design decision s. The 
IRC will determine if enrollment should continue in Cohort 2 . The IRC will also make decisions 
on the number of treatment groups, HTX -011 d ose, study drug administration technique  for 
HTX -011, and the number of subjects treated, as outlined in Section 3.1.2 . The i nterim analys is 
will be performed after  at least 80% of the planned number of subjects in Cohort 1 have all of 
their pain intensity and opioid use data through the 72 -hour postoperative  assessments entered 
into electronic clinical database.  The choice of 72  hours was based  on results from all HTX -011 
clinical studies to date , which showed that the time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) for 
bupivacaine is less than 24  hours. An inter im analysis after  the 72-hour assessments will 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 24 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  therefore include maximal exposure to study  drug. There will be no interim analyses on data 
collected during Cohort 2.  
The study will employ a randomized and double -blind design to minimize potential bias in 
subject selection  as well as  efficacy and safety assessments . The site’s pharmacy staff and 
surgical staff will not be blinded to the treatment assignments because HTX -011 is a colored and 
viscous liquid whereas bupivacaine HCl and saline placebo are not , and the volume of study drug 
to be administered varies by treatment group . However, subjects will not be aware of the study 
drug they are receiving, and once surgery is complete  and the subject is transferred to the 
postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the Inv estigator and all staff involved in efficacy and safety 
assessments will be blinded to treatment assignments until after database lock . 
As a postoperative pain study, the primary efficacy endpoint is the area under the curve (AUC) 
of Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain intensity scores with activity  (NRS -A) from the sta rt of 
study drug administration  through 72 hours . Secondary efficacy endpoints  will be assessed 
through 72  hours  and beyond  and include assessments of opioid use, including the time to firs t 
use of opioid rescue medication, as recommended by draft Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) 
guidelines  (FDA Draft Guidance for Indust ry, Analgesic Indications: Developing Drug and 
Biological Products [February 2014 ]). 
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
As of the 23 October 2017, a total of 1,649  subjects have been treated in 9  completed, concluded, 
or ongoing studies in the HTX -011 clinical development program. This includes two Phase 1 
studies in healthy volunteers and six  Phase 2 and one Phase 3 studie s in subjects undergoing 
elective surgery (bunionectomy, herniorrhaphy, abdominoplasty, TKA, and augmentation 
mammoplasty). Three studies are ongoing and remain blinded (Studies 209, 211, and 302). An 
estimated 612 subjects have received a single dose of H TX-011 at doses ranging from 
30 mg/0.9  mg to 600  mg/18  mg. HTX -011 was administered via SC injection (10  subjects), local 
administration into the surgical site (an estimated 541  subjects), or nerve block (an estimated 
61 subjects). An additional 265  subjec ts received an earlier formulation: HTX -011-19 
(158 subjects ) or HTX -011-49 (107 subjects).  
Study 102  was a Phase 1 study that evaluated a single dose of HTX -011 400  mg/12 mg 
administered via SC injection in 10  healthy volunteers. The most common treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were administration site reactions including bruising, pain, warmth, 
erythema, nodule, and swelling. Study 02 was a Phase 1 study that evaluated 2 earlier 
formulations, HTX -011-19 and HTX -011-49, in healthy volunteers. Subj ects received a single 
SC dose of 1 of these formulations at doses ranging from 100  mg/3  mg to 400 mg/12 mg or 
saline placebo. The 2 most common TEAEs were contusion and erythema at the site of 
administration. All TEAEs in both Phase 1 studies were mild in  severity and all resolved. No 
serious adverse events (SAEs)  were reported in either study.  
HTX -011 has been evaluated in Phase 2a clinical studies in nonvisceral and visceral surgical 
models.  In Phase 2a bunionectomy, herniorrhaphy, and abdominoplasty stu dies, subjects 
undergoing surgery received a single dose of HTX -011 ranging from 30 mg/0.9  mg to 
600 mg/18  mg. HTX -011 was administered via local administration into the surgical site 
(injection [with or without a Mayo block], instillation [with or without  a Luer -lock applicator], or 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 25 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  a combination of injection and instillation). HTX -011 was generally well tolerated. The majority 
of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity  and resolved without sequelae.  In these studies, the 
3 most common TEAEs in the HTX -011-treatment groups were nausea, vomiting, and headache 
for bunionectomy; constipation, nausea, and headache for herniorrhaphy; and nausea, 
constipation, and headache for abdominoplasty. Two serious adverse reactions ( SARs ; SAEs 
considered related to study d rug by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor)  were reported in subjects 
who received HTX -011. In the bunionectomy study, 1 SAR of non -healing postoperative wound 
was reported in a subject who received HTX -011 200 mg/6 mg . In the abdominoplasty study, 
1 SAR o f wound dehiscence was reported in a subject who received HTX -011 300 mg/9 mg.  
 
 
 
 
An identified risk for HTX -011 is incision site erythema , which  was observed primaril y in 
bunionectomy . Most events were self -limiting, mild or moderate in severity, and resolved 
without intervention or sequelae . 
Potential risks for bupivacaine include dose -related cardiovascular (CV) and central nervous 
system  toxicity  (MARCAINE USPI, 2011 ; MARCAIN SmPC, 201 6). Close attention should be 
given to conditions that may represent reported toxicities associated with bupivacaine including, 
but not limited to, perioral tingling, metallic  taste, visual and auditory disturbances, muscle 
twitching, seizure, acidosis,  shortness of brea th, bradycardia (heart rate <50  beats per minute 
with symptoms), hypotension ( systolic blood pressure <90  mmHg or symptomatic decrease from 
baseline), low oxygen saturation (≤90% for ≥1  minute), and cardiac arrest.  
Potential risks for mel oxicam include CV adverse reactions , gastrointestinal bleeding , and liver 
tests elevations  (MOBIC SmPC, 2015 ; MOBIC Tablets USPI, 2016 ). NSAIDs may cause an 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be 
fatal, and this risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with CV disease or risk factors for 
CV disease may be at greater risk . NSAI Ds may also cause an increased risk of serious 
gastrointestinal AEs including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, 
which can be fatal . Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events . 
Borderline eleva tions of 1  or more liver tests may occur in patients taking NSAIDs, including 
meloxicam, which may worsen. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver 
dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver function test has occurred, should be evaluated for 
evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction . It is unclear how applicable these 
potential risks are for meloxicam when giv en as a single dose via local administration (a novel 
administration method for meloxicam) for postoperative pain as part of a f ixed-ratio combination 
(eg, HTX -011). 
Potential risks for ropivacaine include dose related CV and central nervous system toxicit y 
(Naropin USPI, 2012 ; Naropin SmPC, 2017 ). Close attention should be given to conditions that 
may represent reported toxicities associated with ropivacaine including, but not limited to, 
perioral tingling, metallic taste, visual and auditory disturbances, muscle twitching, s eizure, 
acidosis, shortness of breath, bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats per minute with symptoms), 
hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90  mmHg or symptomatic decrease from baseline), low

Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  oxygen saturation (≤90% for ≥1  minute), and cardiac arrest. Uninte nded intravascular 
administration may result in cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac arrest.  
Use of HTX -011 in subjects with hypersensitivity to bupivacaine, meloxicam, ropivacaine or any 
of the components of HTX -011 is contraindicated.  
As seen in the Phase 2a clinical studies, a single dose of HTX -011 given via local administration 
into the surgical site resulted in superior postoperative analgesia compared with bupivacaine HCl 
in all 3 studies, as indicated by significantly lower mean AUC of pain intensity sco res. 
Furthermore, the analgesic effect with HTX -011 extended longer than 24  hours: over 72 hours in 
bunionectomy, over 48  hours in herniorrhaphy, and over 96 hours in complete abdominoplasty.  
The reduction in pain translated into an increase in the number  of subjects who did not require 
opioids. In bunionectomy, 3 times the number of HTX -011 60 mg/1.8 mg -treated subjects were 
opioid free 24  hours following surgery compared with bupivacaine HCl (26.9% vs. 8.0%) and by 
72 hours, 17.3% of HTX -011 60 mg/1.8 mg  -treated subjects remained opioid free. In 
herniorrhaphy, half (50%) of HTX -011 300 mg/9 mg -treated subjects were opioid free 72 hours 
following surgery compared with 11.8% for bupivacaine HCl. In both studies, all subjects who 
were opioid free in the fir st 48  hours remained opioid free through 96 hours. In addition to 
increasing the proportion of opioid -free subjects, HTX -011 reduced total opioid consumption. In 
bunionectomy, HTX -011 60 mg/1.8 mg significantly reduced total opioid consumption over 
72 hours compared with bupivacaine HCl (approximately 30% lower). Similar findings were 
noted in abdominoplasty. In herniorrhaphy, the median values for total opioid use were also 
notably lower over 72 hours for HTX -011 compared with b upivacaine HCl (2.5  mg vs. 1 5.0 mg).

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN AND ENDPOINTS  
3.1. Description of the Study Design  
3.1.1.  Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  2b, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and PK of HTX -011 administered via infiltration  
to the surgical site in subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA . 
All s ubjects will be screened within 21 days prior to surgery . Subjects who meet the S creening 
eligibility criteria will be randomized . Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to 
the day of surgery . On the day of surgery (Day  0), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility 
criteria will continue on study and will undergo primary unilateral TKA under general 
anesthesia .  
Just b efore being taken to  the operating room prior to the start of the surgery, subject s in Cohort 
2 will be administered pregabalin orally (PO; 150 mg) and acetaminophen  intravenously (IV ; no 
more than 1 g [1000  mg] in a 6 -hour window , as per the approved prescribing information ) to 
reduce initial  postoperative pain.  Although not indicated for postoperative pain (Lyrica USPI, 
2009 ), pregabalin is used in clinical studies as multimodal perioperative analgesia (Buvanendran, 
2010 ; Li, 2017 ). Pregabalin was included in a Phase 4 study PILAR of EXPAREL in patients 
undergoing TKA (Mont, 2017 ). For this use, pregabalin is administered PO before surgery at 
dose l evels up to 300 mg.  
A single dose of study drug (HTX -011 with or without  ropivacaine, bupivacaine HCl  without 
epinephrine , or saline placebo) will be administered intraoperatively by infiltration  to the 
surgical site ( eg, periarticular  instillation , periarticular  injection, or a combination of periarticular  
injection and instillation ) as described in Section  5.5. Specifically in Cohort 2, HTX -011 will be 
administered via periarticular instillation with or without ropivacaine via periarticular injection.  
During surgery, the use of fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg will be permitted for intraoperative pain 
control. Just prior to the end of the surgery , all subjects  will receive an additional 75 µg of 
fentanyl  IV to minimize the variability of the impact of fentanyl on postoperative care (for 
example , the maximum amount of fenta nyl used during surgery for a 70 kg subject should not 
exceed 355 µg [4 μg/kg × 70 kg = 280 μg for intraoperative pain control + 75 μg at the end of the 
case = 355 μg total] ). Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be 
transferred to the PACU . Subjects will remain in the hospital /research facility  for a minimum of 
72 hours after study drug administration to undergo postoperative assessments . The study staff 
will ensure adequate safety precautions are in place to prevent postoperative falls . After the 
72-hour assessments have been  complete d, subjects  may be discharged . Subjects will return to 
the study site on Day  10 and Day 28 to complete follow -up assessments.  
An internal IRC will review unblinded, summary -level efficacy, safety, and PK data from 
Cohort  1 to determine if enrollment should be initiated in  Cohort 2 . The interim analysis will be 
performed after at least 80% of the planned number of subjects in Cohort  1 have all of their pain 
intensity and opioid use data through the 72 -hour postoperative assessments entered into 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 29 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  electronic clinical database . The IRC will operate under a written, detailed IRC Charter.  There 
will be no interim analyses on data collected during Cohort 2.  
3.1.2.  Treatment Groups  
The study will include 2 cohorts.  
Cohort 1  
Approximately  60 subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 4 treatment groups  in a 
2:2:1:1 ratio:  
 HTX -011 200  mg/6 mg  (6.8 mL) via periarticular  instillation into the surgical site 
(20 subjects)  
 HTX -011 200  mg/6 mg  (6.8 mL) via a combi nation of periarticular  inject ion and instillation 
into the surgical site ( 20 subjects)  
 Saline placebo ( 6.8 mL) via periarticular  injec tion into the surgical site (10  subjects)  
 Bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine 0.25% ( 125 mg, 50 mL) via periarticular  injection into 
the surgical site (10 subjects)  
Cohort  2 
Cohort 2 was planned as an optional cohort. Following a review of the results from Cohort 1, the 
IRC recommended initiating enrollment in Cohort 2 with a  single dose level of HTX -011 
400 mg/12 mg (bupivacaine/meloxicam doses; 13.7 mL) in each H TX-011 treatment group.  
Approximately  200 subjects will be randomized to 1  of the following 4 treatment groups  in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio :  
 HTX -011 400 mg/12 mg (13.7 mL)  via periarticular  instillation into the surgical site 
(50 subjects)  
 HTX -011 400 mg/12 mg (13.7 mL)  via periarticular  instillation into the surgical site  and 
ropivacaine 0.5% (50 mg, 10 mL) via periarticular injection into the surgical site  (posterior 
capsule)  (50 subjects)  
 Saline placebo ( 13.7 mL) via periarticular  injection into the surgical site ( 50 subjects)  
 Bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine 0.25% ( 125 mg, 50 mL) via periarticular  injection into 
the surgical site ( 50 subjects)  
3.1.3.  Postoperative Opioid Rescue Medications  
Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request for pain control, as needed , during 
the 72 -hour postoperative  observation period . Rescue medication should not be given for pain 
prophylaxis, but only for pain treatment. Prior to the administration of the first dose of rescue 
medication, if the subject has no t already had at least 1 postoperative pain score assessed, then a  
Numeric Rating Scale score at rest ( NRS -R) followed by a Numeric Rating Scale score with 
activity ( NRS -A) pain score must be obtained.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 30 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Postoperative rescue medication will consist of IV mor phine and/or PO immediate -release  
oxycodone . For the first 2 hours in the PACU, the subject may receive up to 15  mg IV morphine , 
as needed . Thereafter, the subject may receive up to 10 mg in a 2 -hour period, as needed. In 
addition, t he subject may also rec eive up to 10 mg of PO immediate -release oxycodone  within 
any 4-hour period as needed , from after study drug administration through 72  hours . No other 
analgesic agents are permit ted during the 72 -hour postoperative observation period  (except as 
specified by the protocol ; see Section 3.1.5 ).  
After 72  hours, the analgesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually as d eemed 
appropriate by the physician responsible for the postoperative care  and in accordance with the 
verbal discharge instructions . See the Study Reference Manual for more information on 
postoperative pain management after discharge.  Subjects will complete  a daily diary to record if 
they take an opioid medication between 72 hours and Day 28.  
3.1.4.  Required Antifibrinolysis and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis  
All subjects are required to tranexamic acid (TXA) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) during the 
study.  TXA 1 g IV will be administered prior to the start of surgery and a second dose will be 
administered up to approximately 8 hours later. For the time period after study drug 
administration until hospital discharge, subjects should receive ASA 325  mg PO twi ce a day ; 
surgeons may also use additional DVT prophylaxis as per their standard of care.  
3.1.5.  Use of Other Analgesics  
With the exception of preoperative administration of pregabalin  and acetaminophen  (in Cohort 2 
only) , intraoperative administration of study drug (including ropivacaine in 1 arm in Cohort 2 ) 
and fentanyl, protocol -specified opioid rescue medications, and ASA for DVT prophylaxis , no 
other analgesic agents, including ketamine and NSAIDs, are permitted from the time the subject

4.2. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized . Randomization may be 
done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery . Subjects will be randomized using a 
computer -generated randomization scheme . All randomization information will be kept in a 
secure location accessible only by the r andomization personnel , the assigned Pharmacist (s) and 
his/her verifier , and the unblinded clinical monitor.  No subject may receive study drug prior to 
randomization.  
4.2.1.  Procedures for Handling Randomized Subjects  Who Do Not Meet the Study 
Eligibility Criteri a 
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, receive 
study drug . 
Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria and are randomized but who do not meet the 
eligibility criteria on Day  0 will be withdrawn fr om the study without receiving  study drug. In 
the event a subject does not meet the eligibility criteria , but is randomized and receives study 
drug, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor immediately . The Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor 
and the Investigator will discuss whether to allow the subject to continue on study . 
4.3. Blinding  
The study will use a  double -blind design . The site’s pharmacy and surgical staff will not be 
blinded to the treatment assignments b ecause HTX -011 is a colored and viscous liquid where as 
bupivacaine HCl and saline placebo  are not , and the volume of study drug to be administered 
varies by treatment group . However, subjects will not be aware of the study drug they are 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 36 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  receiving, and once surgery is completed and the subject is transferred  to the PACU , the 
Investigator and all site staff involved in safety and efficacy assessments will be blinded to the 
treatment assignment until after database lock . The Sponsor’s study team will also be blinded to 
the treatment assignments with the exception of the clinical trial material (CTM) staff, Clinical 
Research Specialists (observers in surgery), the bioanalytical staff,  Population PK modeling 
staff, and the u nblinded statistician who will perform the randomization and interim analysis data 
review, but will otherwise be uninvolved in the conduct of the study.  
An internal IRC will be unblinded during the interim review of the summary -level efficacy, 
safety, and PK data  from  Cohort 1 . 
4.3.1.  Breaking the Blind  
The study blind should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the study drug he/she received . An attempt 
should be made to contact the Sponsor before breaking the blind. If the Sponsor cannot be 
reached and the blind is broken by the Investigator,  the reason for unblinding must be 
documented and the Sponsor must be contacted within 24 hours.  
The Sponsor retains the right to break the treatment code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an investigational product ( IP) and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities . 
All circumstances leading to the premature unblinding must be clearly documented.  
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
4.4.1.  Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to withdraw  from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment . 
A subject may also be withdrawn from the study by the Investigator or the Sponsor at any time if 
either determines that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue participation . 
Possible reasons for early withdrawal  include the following:  
 Adverse event  
 Consent  withdrawal  
 Death  
 Lost to follow up  
 Investigator’s decision  
 Sponsor’s decision  
 Screen fail on Day 0  
The date and the primary reason for early withdrawal  will be recorded on the electr onic Case 
Report Form ( eCRF ). At the time of withdrawal  from the study , every attempt should be made to 
complete the Early Termination  Visit  assessments (s ee Section  7.4).

All subjects will rece ive a single dose of study drug intraoperatively while undergoing primary 
unilateral TKA . Study drug is defined as HTX -011 (IP) with or without  ropivacaine, bupivacaine 
HCl without epinephrine (active control), or saline placebo  (control) .  
HTX -011 will be supplied by the Sponsor . Bupivacaine HCl , ropivacaine 0.5%,  and saline 
placebo will be supplied by study site s.  
5.1. Description of Investigational Product  
HTX -011 is a slightly yellow , viscous , semi -solid gel liquid . HTX -011 is supplied in prefilled 
sterile syringes and/or vials . The prefilled syringe s and vials serve only as a closed container for 
the drug product . For administration of study drug, the formulation in the prefilled syringes 
and/or vials will be aseptically transferred to sterile syringes.  
5.2. Manufacturing, Packaging , and Labeling  
HTX -011 will be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices, and  packaged and 
labeled  by the Sponsor or designee . HTX -011 will be packed and dispatched to comply with 
shippi ng and storage conditions . HTX -011 labeling will comply with all applicable federal and 
local laws and regulations . 
5.3. Storage  
HTX -011 should be stored at the study site in a refrigerator at 2ºC to 8ºC . The refrigerator should 
be in a locked area with restric ted access . A temperature log should be maintained to monitor the 
refrigerator ’s temperature . 
Saline placebo , ropivacaine,  and bupivacaine HCl will be stored as per the prescribing 
information.  
5.4. Preparation  
Study drug will be prepared at the study site by an unblinded study pharmacist  or staff . Refer to 
the Pharmacy Manual for details on study drug preparation.  
5.5. Study Drug Administration  
5.5.1.  Study Drug Administration in Cohort 1  
This section describes the administration technique of study drug  in Cohort 1 : HTX -011, 
bupivacaine  HCl, and saline placebo.  
HTX -011 will be administered via one of the following  techniques to the surgical wound:  
 Periarticular instillation  
 Periarticular injection  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 39 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential   Combination (both periarticular injection and instillation)  
Bupivacaine  HCl and saline placebo will be administered by periarticular injection only. 
However,  note the following  difference in volume : 
 The volume of bupivacaine HCl (0.25% w ithout epinephrine) is 50 mL  
 The volume of saline placebo will vary depending on the cohor t 
5.5.1.1.  HTX -011 
5.5.1.1.1.  Periarticular Instillation  
The total volume of HTX -011 is to be administered intraoperatively. It is important to be 
cautious because the total volume of HTX -011 is lower than the usual volume of bupivacaine  
HCl. For example, in Cohort 1, the tot al volume of HTX -011 is only 6.8 mL.  
Instillation is the direct topical coating of the periosteum and joint capsule with HTX -011. This 
will be done using syringes with a Luer-lock applicator (without a needle).  To avoid study drug 
interference with the properties of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement, care should be taken to 
avoid contact between study drug and the cement.  
HTX -011 will be instilled as follows: half (½) the volume onto the posterior capsule, a qu arter 
(¼) to the anteromedial tissues and periosteum, and a quarter (¼) to the anterolateral tissues and 
periosteum. Study drug should be prepared in 4 syringes, each containing equal volumes of study 
drug. The goal of this method of application is even di stribution of the drug throughout the entire 
joint lining containing sensory nerve fibers including capsule, synovium, and periosteum.  
1. Posterior Capsular Administration  
a. Drug instillation to the posterior capsule is performed after cementation of the 
components and placement of the tibial tray/spacer. It is expected that irrigation and 
suction will be complete before study drug administration. The surgeon may utilize 
pulsatile lavage and irrigate as desired after cementation and placement of all 
compon ents, but not after instillation of the study drug.  
b. The posterior capsular instillation will take place in 3 areas: the posterior medial 
capsule, the posterior lateral capsule and the central posterior capsule. For ideal 
posterior capsular placement, it is  recommended the knee be placed at approximately 
90 degrees of flexion. An assistant may also gently translate the tibia forward a few 
millimeters if needed  to better access the central posterior capsule  and/or retract the 
relevant capsular tissues as need ed.  
c. The first syringe with the Luer -lock applicator is inserted full -length behind the 
medial condyle, between the condyle and the medial capsule to reach the posterior 
capsule as far proximal and as deep as possible (flexion, slight forward translation , 
and retraction all help to attain this goal). Instill the first half of the syringe with the 
Luer -lock applicator in this area.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 40 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  d. The remainder of study drug from the first syringe with the Luer -lock applicator is 
inserted full -length behind the lateral cond yle between the condyle and the lateral 
capsule to reach the posterior capsule as far proximal and as deep as possible (again 
flexion, slight forward translation , and retraction all help attain this goal). The 
Luer -lock applicator may be placed either abov e or below the popliteus tendon to 
reach the posterior capsule.  
e. The second syringe  is placed into the intracondylar notch, and study drug 
administered directly on to the central posterior capsule. Again, having the knee in 
flexion in slight forward transla tion and with appropriate retraction may help to 
visualize the area.   
i. If a cruciate retaining system is utilized, the syringe with Luer -lock applicator 
is placed full -length into the medial aspect of the femoral component notch (as 
far proximal and as dee p as possible) and half the drug instilled at a 
posteromedial angle. The syringe is then moved to the lateral aspect of the 
femoral component notch (maintaining its deep position) and the remainder of 
study drug is instilled at a posterolateral angle. Thes e maneuvers allow drug to 
be instilled directly to coat the entirety of the central posterior capsular region. 
Gravity will draw study drug distally toward the tibia as the drug is instilled.  
ii. If a posterior -stabilized design is utilized, best visualization  will likely be over 
the top of the tibial post, so the entire contents of the syringe should be 
instilled from that point (with the syringe and Luer -lock applicator inserted 
full-length at the proximal and deepest aspect of the central region of the 
capsu le, directly coating the entirety of the central region by moving from 
medial to lateral). Gravity will draw study drug distally toward the tibia as the 
drug is instilled.  
f. The knee is then brought out into full extension and kept in that position for the 
remainder of the case. The surgeon may choose to massage the back of the knee 
briefly to help distribute the drug.  
2. Anteromedial tissues and periosteum : The third syringe and Luer -lock applicator is used to 
instill the medial gutter, periosteum, and capsule.  Be sure to evenly distribute the study drug 
onto all these surfaces. Retraction and elevation of the medial capsule by an assistant to best 
visualize these areas will be helpful to ensure even coating.  
3. Anterolateral tissues, periosteum, and closure : The final syringe and Luer -lock applicator 
is similarly used to instill study drug onto the lateral capsule, periosteum, lateral gutter, fat 
pad, and quadriceps tendon, which should all be coated evenly . Again, elevation of the lateral 
capsule and quadriceps wi ll help with visualization. Wound closure of the arthrotomy, fascia , 
and dermis may then take place per surgeon preference.  
5.5.1.1.2.  Combination of Periarticular Injection and Instillation  
The total volume of HTX -011 is to be administered intraoperatively.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 41 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  For this administration assignment, HTX -011 will be prepared in 2 groups of syringes: 1 group 
of syringes with an 18G needle for periarticular injection and the other group of syringes without 
a needle for instillation. For example, in Cohort 1  each o f those groups contains 3.4 mL for a 
total of 6.8 mL . See Section 3.1.2  for the specific volume of HTX -011 to be administered  for 
each cohort . 
Combinatio n Administration: Injection  Steps  
Injection of the posterior capsule should occur prior to cementation and placement of 
components to allow adequate visualization.  
Posterior Capsule  
One half of the total volume of injectate is placed in the posterior capsu le.  
 The HTX -011 injection will be performed just prior to mixing of cement and placement of 
components. At this point , it is expected that the menisci have been resected and the posterior 
aspect of the joint debrided as needed, taking care to avoid injury to poste rior neurovascular 
structures. Typically, mixing of cement may begin during the injection process once  
experienced in the technique. Initially, the knee is placed at 90 degrees using the lamina 
spreader to distract the joint. This will facilitate visualiz ation of the posterior capsule.  
 Injection should be done evenly with 4  to 6 injection points.  
 
 The app ropriate technique should include  the following : 
 Insertion of the needle by a few millimeters  
 Aspiration to ensure the needle is not intravascular (this is mandatory due to the potential 
of unintended intravascular administration), then  
 Injection of a smal l amount of HTX -011. NOTE: Unintended intravascular injection 
may cause life -threatening central nervous system and cardiac sequelae.  
Combination Administration: Instillation  Steps  
Instillation of the remaining tissues should then take place at the end of the case, prior to closure 
but after irrigation and suction have  been completed.  

Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 42 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Periosteum Administration and Remaining Capsular A dministration  
 Instill the remaining volume using the syringe with a Luer-lock applicator to all exposed 
intra-articular soft tissues, including the following:  
 Periosteum of the femur and tibia  
 Medial and lateral gutters including periosteum and capsular tissue  
 Anterior joint capsule including patellofemoral capsule, peripatellar region and any 
remaining anterior fat pad and tend inous structures  
 Wound closure of the arthrotomy, fascia , and dermis may now take place per surgeon 
preference . Avoid HTX -011 administration into the  shallow subdermal area . 
5.5.1.1.3.  Periarticular Injection  
The total volume of HTX -011 is to be administered intraoperatively . 
Injection of the posterior, medial , and lateral capsule should occur prior to cementation and 
placement of components to allow adequate visualization . 
Posterior Capsule  
One half of the total volume of injectate is p laced in the posterior capsule.  
 The HTX -011 injection will be performed just prior to mixing of cement and placement of 
components. At this point , it is expected that the menisci have been resected and the posterior 
aspect of the joint debrided as needed,  taking care to avoid injury to posterior neurovascular 
structures. Typically, mixing of cement may begin during the injection process once 
experienced in the technique. Initially, the knee is placed at 90 degrees using the lamina 
spreader to distract the joint. This will facilitate visualization of the posterior capsule.  
 Injection should be done e venly with 4 to 6 injection points.  
 
 The appropriate technique should include:  
 Insertion of the needle by a few millimeters  
 Aspiration to ensure the needle is not intravascular (this is mandatory due to the potential 
of unintended intravascular administration), then  

Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 43 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential   Injection of a small amount of HTX -011. NOTE: Unintended intravascular injection 
may cause life -threatening central nervous system and cardiac seque lae. 
Medial and Lateral Capsule  
One half of the remaining volume is divided equally into the medial and lateral capsule.  
 In similar fashion to posterior capsule injection, inject an equal volume medially and laterally 
with multiple injection points to even ly distribute HTX -011 throughout both capsular 
regions, and periosteum of the femur and tibia . 
Peripatellar Area and Dermal Tissue  
The remainder of the injections should occur at the end of the case, after all irrigation and suction 
have occurred.  
 Peripatellar Area  
 The peripatellar area includes all anterior joint capsular tissues and patellofemoral 
capsule.  
 Using approximately 2/3 of the remaining volume, inject at multiple points to evenly 
distribute HTX -011 throughout the area, including the quad riceps and patellar tendons.  
 Dermal Tissue  
 Before surgical wound closure, administer the remaining HTX -011 into the deep tissue 
on either side of the skin incision. Avoid administration into the shallow subdermal area.  
5.5.1.2.  Bupivacaine HCl and Saline Placebo  
The total volume of study drug is to be administered intraoperativel y via periarticular injection. 
It is important to be cautious because the total volume of saline placebo will vary and is lower 
than the usual volume of bupivacaine HCl. For examp le, in Cohort 1 the total volume for 
bupivacaine  HCl is 50 mL while the total volume for saline placebo is only 6.8 mL.

Bupivacaine HCl Injection (Total Volume = 50 mL)  
Injection should occur prior to cementation and placement of components to allow adequate 
visualization.  
Posterior Capsule  
 The bupivacaine HCl  injection will be performed just prior to mixing of cement and 
placement of components. At this point , it is expected that the menisci have been resected 
and the posterior aspect of the joint debrided as needed, taking care to avoid injury to 
posterior  neurovascular structures. Typically, mixing of cement may begin during the

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  injection process once  experienced in the technique . Initially, the knee is placed at 90  degrees 
using the lamina spreader to distract the joint. This will facilitate visualization of the 
posterior capsule.  
 Approximately 25 mL will be injected into the posterior capsule. This should be done evenly 
with at least 10 to 15 injection points.  
 
 The appropriate technique should include:  
 Insertion of the needle by a few millimeters  
 Aspiration to ensure the needle is not intravascular (this is mandatory due to the potential 
of unintended intr avascular administration), then  
 Injection of a small amount of bupivacaine HCl . NOTE: unintended intravascular 
injection may cause life -threatening central nervous system and cardiac sequelae.  
Medial and Lateral Capsule  
 In similar fashion to posterior caps ule injection, inject 7 mL medially and 7 mL laterally with 
multiple injection points to evenly distribute bupivacaine HCl throughout both capsular 
regions, and periosteum of the femur and tibia . 
Peripatellar Area  
 The peripatellar area includes all anterio r joint capsular tissues and patellofemoral capsule.  
 Inject 8 mL with multiple injection points to evenly distribute bupivacaine  HCl throughout 
the area.  
Dermal Tissue  
 Before surgical wound closure, administer the  remaining bupivacaine HCl into the deep 
tissue on either side of the skin incision . Avoid  administration into the shallow subdermal 
area.  
Saline Placebo Injection  
Saline placebo injection will be performed as described above for bupivacaine HCl injection 
with adjustments made for volume. The volum e of saline placebo will vary in each cohort. For 
example, in Cohort 1 the total volume is 6.8 mL.

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  5.5.2.  Study Drug Administration in Cohort 2  
This section describes the administration technique of study drug  in Cohort 2 : HTX -011, 
ropivacaine, bupivacaine HCl, and saline placebo.  HTX -011 will be administered with or 
without ropivacaine.  
HTX -011 will be administered via periarticular instillation to the surgical wound.  
Bupivacaine HCl and saline placebo will be administered by periarticular injection only. 
Howeve r, note the following difference in volume:  
 The volume of bupivacaine HCl (0.25% without epinephrine) is 50 mL  
 The volume of saline placebo is 13.7 mL  
Ropivacaine 0.5% (50 mg; 10 mL) will be administered by injection to the posterior capsule 
only.  
5.5.2.1.  HTX -011 Without Ropivacaine  
5.5.2.1.1.  Periarticular Instillation  
The total volume of HTX -011 is to be administered intraoperatively. It is important to be 
cautious because the total volume of HTX -011 is lower than the volume of bupivacaine HCl. In 
Cohort 2, the total volum e of HTX -011 is only 13.7 mL.  
Instillation is the direct topical coating of the periosteum and joint capsule with HTX -011. This 
will be done using syringes with a Luer -lock applicator (without a needle).  To avoid study drug 
interference with the properties  of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement, care should be taken to 
avoid contact between study drug and the cement.  
For instillation to the posterior capsule, HTX -011 100 mg /3 mg will be prepared in 2 syringes 
each containing equal volumes of study drug. For instillation to the anteromedial and 
anterolateral tissues and periosteum, HTX -011 300 mg /9 mg  will be prepared in 4 syringes each 
containing equal volumes of study drug. The goal of this method of application is even 
distribution of the drug throughout th e entire joint lining containing sensory nerve fibers 
including capsule, synovium, and periosteum.  
1. Posterior Capsular Administration  
a. Drug instillation to the posterior capsule is performed after cementation of the 
components and placement of the tibial tra y/spacer. It is expected that irrigation and 
suction will be complete before study drug administration. The surgeon may utilize 
pulsatile lavage and irrigate as desired after cementation and placement of all 
components, but not after instillation of the st udy drug.  
b. The posterior capsular instillation will take place in 3 areas: the posterior medial 
capsule, the posterior lateral capsule and the central posterior capsule. For ideal 
posterior capsular placement, it is recommended the knee be placed at approxi mately 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 46 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  90 degrees of flexion. An assistant may also gently translate the tibia forward a few 
millimeters if needed  to better access the central posterior capsule  and/or retract the 
relevant capsular tissues as needed.  
c. The first syringe for instillation to  posterior capsule with the Luer -lock applicator is 
inserted full -length behind the medial condyle, between the condyle and the medial 
capsule to reach the posterior capsule as far proximal and as deep as possible (flexion, 
slight forward translation, and retraction all help to attain this goal). Instill the first 
half of the syringe with the Luer -lock applicator in this area.  
d. The remainder of study drug from the first syringe with the Luer -lock applicator is 
inserted full -length behind the lateral condyle between the condyle and the lateral 
capsule to reach the posterior capsule as far proximal and as deep as possible (again 
flexion, slight forward translation, and retraction all help attain this goal). The 
Luer -lock applicator may be placed either above or  below the popliteus tendon to 
reach the posterior capsule.  
e. The second syringe  for instillation to posterior capsule is placed into the intracondylar 
notch, and study drug administered directly on to the central posterior capsule. Again, 
having the knee in  flexion in slight forward translation and with appropriate retraction 
may help to visualize the area.   
i. If a cruciate retaining system is utilized, the syringe with Luer -lock applicator 
is placed full -length into the medial aspect of the femoral component  notch (as 
far proximal and as deep as possible) and half the drug instilled at a 
posteromedial angle. The syringe is then moved to the lateral aspect of the 
femoral component notch (maintaining its deep position) and the remainder of 
study drug is instill ed at a posterolateral angle. These maneuvers allow drug to 
be instilled directly to coat the entirety of the central posterior capsular region. 
Gravity will draw study drug distally toward the tibia as the drug is instilled.  
ii. If a posterior -stabilized desi gn is utilized, best visualization will likely be over 
the top of the tibial post, so the entire contents of the syringe should be 
instilled from that point (with the syringe and Luer -lock applicator inserted 
full-length at the proximal and deepest aspect of the central region of the 
capsule, directly coating the entirety of the central region by moving from 
medial to lateral). Gravity will draw study drug distally toward the tibia as the 
drug is instilled.  
f. The knee is then brought out into full extension a nd kept in that position for the 
remainder of the case. The surgeon may choose to massage the back of the knee 
briefly to help distribute the drug.  
2. Anteromedial tissues and periosteum : The first 2 of the remaining 4 syringes and 
Luer -lock applicator are used to instill the medial gutter, periosteum, and capsule. Be sure to 
evenly distribute the study drug onto all these surfaces. Retraction and elevation of the 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 47 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  medial capsule by an assistant to best visualize these areas will be helpful to ensure even 
coating.  
3. Anterolateral tissues, periosteum, and closure : The final 2 of the  remaining  4 syringe s and 
Luer -lock applicator are similarly used to instill study drug onto the lateral capsule, 
periosteum, lateral gutter, fat pad, and quadriceps tendon, which sh ould all be coated evenly. 
Again, elevation of the lateral capsule and quadriceps will help with visualization. Wound 
closure of the arthrotomy, fascia, and dermis may then take place per surgeon preference.  
5.5.2.2.  HTX -011 With Ropivacaine  
5.5.2.2.1.  Periarticular Instillat ion of HTX -011 
Periarticular instillation of HTX -011 is described in Section 5.5.2.1.1 . 
5.5.2.2.2.  Injection of Ropivacaine in the Posterior Capsule  
 The ropivacaine injection will be performed just prior to mixing of cement and placement of 
components. At this point, it is expected that the menisci have been resected and the posterior 
aspect of the joint debrided as needed, taking care to avoid injury to posterior neurovascular 
structures. Typically, mixing of cement may begin during the injection process once 
experienced in the technique. Initially, the knee is placed at 90  degrees using the lamina 
spreader to distract the joint. This will facilitate v isualization of the posterior capsule.  
 Ropivacaine should be injected in posterior capsule evenly with at least 10 to 15 injection 
points.  
 
 The appropriate technique should include:  
 Insertion of the needle by a few millimeters  
 Aspiration to ensure the ne edle is not intravascular (this is mandatory due to the potential 
of unintended intravascular administration), then  
 Injection of a small amount of ropivacaine. NOTE: unintended intravascular injection 
may cause life -threatening central nervous system and c ardiac sequelae.  
5.5.2.3.  Bupivacaine HCl and Saline Placebo  
The total volume of study drug is to be administered intraoperatively via periarticular injection. 
It is important to be cautious because the total volume of saline placebo is lower than the usual

All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through Day  28. See Section  8 for details.  
6.4.2.  Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity Assessment  
Subjects should be assessed on a regular basis to identify early neurologic and cardia c signs and 
symptoms that may be attributed to local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST; eg, 
metallic/strange taste, perioral tingling, ringing in ears, visual disturbance, tremors, muscle 
twitching, dizziness/lightheadedness, convulsion/seizure, bradycard ia, arrhythmia, hypotension) 
(Vasques, 2015 ). Additional monitoring of subjects for safety should be performed a s needed 
(eg, vital signs , unscheduled PK blood draw ). 
Signs and symptoms that are clinically significant and may be attributed to LAST should be 
recorded as AEs.  
6.4.3.  Physical Examination s 
Scheduled physical examinations will include a n evaluation of the following: head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat as well as CV, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, dermatological, and

This section lists the study procedures and assessments that will be performed at scheduled 
timepoints during the study . See Section  6 for information on study procedures and assessments.  
Unless there is a safety concern, every effort should be made to avoid protocol deviations . For 
assessments at timepoints when the subject  is asleep, an attempt should be made to wake the 
subject . If there is no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as “Not 
Applicable .” Assessments that can be done without waking the subject (eg, blood collection for 
PK sample) should  be completed. Additional visits and/or assessments are permitted if clinically 
indicated in the opinion of the Investigator . 
When the following assessments are scheduled at the same timepoint,  it is recommended that 
they be performed in this  order:  
 NRS -R pain intensity  assessment  (assessed in a dependent position, either seated comfortably 
or lying down)  
 PGA of pain control  
 OBAS assessment

Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring  (American Society of Anesthesiologists, 2015 ). The 
start and stop time of surge ry and additional surgical details should be recorded in the eCRF.   
Subjects will be administered study drug unless they experience a clinically significant event 
during surgery (eg, excessive bleeding, hemodynamic instability) that would render the subject 
medically unstable or complicate their postoperative course . Study drug will be administered via 
infiltration to the su rgical site (eg, periarticular  instillation , periarticular  injection, or a 
combination of periarticular  injection and instillation ). See Section  5.5 for complete details on  
the study drug administration  technique . 
The start and stop times of study drug dosing will be recorded in the eCRF . Details of 
administration will be recorded on a worksheet , which will be used in the dictation of the 
surgical not es and will become part of the source document.  Note:  The start of study drug 
administration will be considered as Time 0  for all efficacy, safety , and PK assessments . 
The start of HTX -011 administration will be considered as Time 0, whether or not 
adminis tered with ropivacaine.  Placement of the last suture will be considered the end of 
surgery.  
During surgery, the use of fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg is permitted. All subjects  will receive 75 µg 
fentanyl IV just prior to the end of the surgery.  As the prescribing  information for fentanyl citrate  
(Fentanyl Citrate USPI, 2012 ) specifies that for in traoperative use a “moderate dose” of 2 to 
20 μg/kg IV is necessary in order to allow the anesthesiologist to respond to any signal that the 
surgical stress is increasing or anesthesia lightening, this dose was chosen to be in the lowermost 
portion of that  range and therefore not interfere with assessment of postoperative opioid load. As 
clinically appropriate, the minimum possible fentanyl dose should be used.  
Concomitant medications used  during surgery will be recorded  (note that IV fluids and oxygen 
are not required to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE) . AEs will also be recorded.  
A PK blood sample should be co llected 30  minutes (±5  min) after the start of study drug 
administration even if the subject is still in the operating room.  
Subjects will receive a second dose of TXA 1 g IV up to approximately 8 hours after the initial 
dose (Dang, 2013 ; ICJR, 2014 ; Danninger, 2015 ). 
After immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the PACU.  
7.2.2.  Postoperative  Assessment Period (Up to 72 Hours)  
Subjects will remain in the hospital /research facility  for 72  hours after study drug administration . 
For the time period after study drug administration until hospital discharge, subjects should 
receive ASA 325 mg PO twice a day; surgeons may also use additional DVT prophylaxis as per 
their stan dard of care.  
Study  procedures and assessments that will be  performed  during the postoperative assessment 
period are listed below . All timepoints are referenced to the start of study drug administration . 
Actual times will be recorded for all events, and any deviation outside the specified ranges must 
be clearly documented in the subject’s study records.

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  8. SAFETY  MONITORING AND REPORTING  
Investigator s are responsible for the detection and documentation of events that meet  the 
definition of an AE, SAE, suspected adverse reaction, serious suspected adverse reaction , 
unanticipated adverse device effect, or unanticipated problem, as provided in this protocol . 
Investigators must review the HTX -011 IB so as to be aware of the safety -related events, which 
may be anticipated with its use . Investigators will also be versed in the latest standard of care 
guidelines . 
8.1. Definition  of Safety Parameters  
8.1.1.  Definition of an Adv erse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or dis ease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug . Any abnormal laboratory value , 
vital sign result, or ECG finding  deemed clinically significant by the Investigator, regar dless of 
causal relationship, must be reported as an AE . A clinical diagnosis, rather than the changes in 
laboratory analyte or other assessment, should be recorded (eg, anemia rather than low 
hemoglobin value) . 
Examples of AEs include the following:  
 Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication under 
study . 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, including either an increase 
in frequency or intensity of the conditio n (eg , abnormal physical  examination finding) . 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction . 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unl ess 
nonserious or serious sequelae occur) . 
 The following abnormal laboratory results:  
 Any laboratory abnormality suggestive of a new disease/organ toxicity or a worsening of 
a pre -existing condition  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have IP interrupted or 
discontinued.  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific treatment for the 
abnormality.  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required additional monitoring and follow -up visits  
 Any laboratory abnormality requ iring further diagnostic investigation  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 62 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  The following examples are not considered AEs:  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg , endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE . 
 Anticipated day to day fluctuations of preexisti ng disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen . 
 The disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease or disorder being studied, unles s they become more severe or occur with a greater 
frequency than expected for the subject’s condition . 
 Transient paresthesia that is considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to occur 
as a long -acting local anesthetic wears off) . 
8.1.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in  any of the following outcomes:  
 Death . 
 A life -threatening AE (ie, presented an immediate risk of death f rom the event as it occurred . 
This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.)  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
 A persistent or significant incapaci ty or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions . 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring  intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of  drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The following events do not meet the definition of an SAE: hospitalization for elective treatment 
of a pre -existing condition that does not worsen from baseline , hospitalizations for a standard 
procedure for study drug administration and routine monitoring of the studied indication not 
associated with any deteriora tion in condition,  social or convenience admission to a hospital , 
prolongation of a hospitalization for social or convenience reasons not associated with the 
occurrence of an AE , or hospitalization or an emergency room visit that lasts less than 24  hours . 
According to 21  Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 812.3(s), an unanticipated adverse device 
effect means  any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, proble m, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relat es to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  8.1.3.  Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by the study drug .  
8.1.4.  Definition of a Serious Su spected Adverse Reaction  
A serious suspected adverse reaction is any suspected adverse reaction that is determined to be 
serious, based on the outcomes of a SAE described in Section  8.1.2 . 
8.1.5.  Definition of Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated problems are incidents, experiences, or outcomes that meet all of the following 
criteria:  
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures tha t 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the research protocol and informed 
consent document approved by the Ethic s Committee (EC; includes Institutional Review 
Boards [IRBs], Independent Ethics Committees [IECs], a nd Research Ethics Boards [REBs]) 
and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied.  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experienc e, or outcome may have been caused by 
the procedures involved in the research).  
 Suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recogni zed. 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.2. Classification of Adverse Event s 
8.2.1.  Severity of Adverse Event s 
The Investigat or will assess the s everity of each AE based on his/her clinical judgment using one 
of the following categorie s: 
 Mild:  Event is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and does not 
interfere with everyday activities . 
 Moderate:  Event results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some  interference with functioning.  
 Severe:  Event interrupts a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other tre atment . Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating . 
8.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of each AE to study drug based on his/her clinical 
judgment . The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s  relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 64 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported . 
All AEs must  have their relationship to study agent assessed . In a clinical trial, the study drug 
must always be suspect . The Sponsor’s assessment of relationship may differ from the 
Investigator’s assessment.  
Relationship to study drug will be assessed according to t he following guidelines : 
 Possibly r elated:  The AE is known to occur with the study drug, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the 
study drug and event . Reasonable possibility means  that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
 Unlikely Related:  There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
drug caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the st udy drug and event 
onset, or an alternate etiology has been established . 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for initially reporting an SAE, it is 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every eve nt before 
entering the information into the eCRF or completing the SAE reporting form, in the event 
electronic data capture (EDC) is not available. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The  Investigator may change his or 
her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and amend the SAE information 
accordingly  in the eCRF or the SAE reporting form, as applicable.  
8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up  
8.3.1.  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Monitoring  
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through Day  28. 
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs in a subject more than 28 days after 
study drug administration  and the Investigator considers the event to be possibly related to the 
study drug, the Investigator needs to report the SAE to the Sponsor as outlined in Section  8.4.1 . 
8.3.2.  Follow -Up of Events  
After the o ccurrence of an AE or SAE, the I nvestigator is required to follow each subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition . All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits or contacts . 
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until the event resolves, the 
condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged by the Investigator to be 
no longer clinically significant (unless the subject is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent) . 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 65 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  The Investigator will assess the outcome of each AE using the following categories:  
 Resolved:  The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae . An event (either 
serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject experienced no 
restrictions . Examples include stent placement for coronary artery disease (a device 
implanted is  not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a sequela), a postoperative wound 
infection, or an upper respiratory tract infection.  
 Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may result in 
permanent disability, functional l imitation, or both . Such sequelae are usually limited to 
SAEs . Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the intended 
outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or emboli formation after a 
bacterial in fection resulting in a renal infarct and loss of renal function.  
 Not resolved:  At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in intensity 
or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown . Examples 
include headac he, low -grade fever, or nausea.  
 Unknown:  The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to follow -up, 
and the status of the event is unknown.  
 Death  
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves  (ie, when the event no longer meets any of t he 
seriousness criteria) , the condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged 
by the Investigator to be no longer clinically significant (unles s the subject is lost to follow -up or 
withdraws consent) . The I nvestigator will ensure that follow -up information provided to the 
Sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both . New or updated information will be recorded as 
outlined in Section  8.4.1 . 
8.4. Reporting Procedures  
8.4.1.  Reporting  Serious Adverse Event s to the Sponsor  
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE  due to any 
cause that occurs during the course of this study, regardless of relationship to study drug , he/she 
must notify the Sponsor by ent ering the SAE information into the eCRF within 24 hours  of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the SAE . 
If EDC is not available, the Investigator must complete an SAE reporting form and email it to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aw are of the SAE. The Investigator must 
also enter the SAE information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter.  
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc .com  
In the initial email, the Investigator must provide to the Sponsor the following eCRF pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible:  
 AE record  
 Medical history  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 66 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential   Prior and concomitant medications  
Also, the following  documents are to be forwarded:  any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE.  
EDC  is the preferred metho d for notification of SAE information. In rare circum stances and in 
the absence of e mail capacity, notification by fax or telephone is acceptable, with a copy of the 
SAE reporting form sent by overnight mail . Initial notification via telephone does not rep lace the 
need for the Investigator to complete the SAE information in the eCRF within the time frames 
outlined.  
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the Sponsor of the event . The SAE must be 
updated when additional information is received . Follow -up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor using the same timelines as for an initial report.  The 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor b y reporting any unanticipated adverse device effect within 
24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the effect.  
8.4.2.  Reporting Unanticipated Problems to the Sponsor  
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an unanticipated 
problem , he/she must notify the Sponsor  by entering the information into the eCRF within 
24 hours of the Investigator  becoming aware of the problem.  
If EDC is not available, the Investigator must complete an unanticipated problem report form 
and em ail it to the Sponsor within 24  hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem. 
The Investigator must also enter the information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter.  
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc .com  
The following information  will be included with unanticipated problem  reporting : 
 Protocol identifying information: protocol title , protocol  number, and Investigator’s name . 
 A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome . 
 An explanation of the basis for deter mining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an unanticipated problem .  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to report unanticipated problems  to the Sponsor and their 
EC, as required by local regulations.  
8.4.3.  Regulatory Reporting Requ irements  
The Investigator must promptly report all SAEs and unanticipated adverse device effect s to the 
Sponsor in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section  8.4.1 . The Sponsor has a legal 
responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory 
agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation . Prompt notification of SAEs 
by the Investigator to the appropriate project contact for SAE receipt is essential so that serious 
suspected adverse reactions that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence be 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 67 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  reported and legal obligation s and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects 
are met.  
Investigator letters are prepared according to Sponsor policy and are forwarded to the 
Investigators as necessary . An Investigator letter is prepared for any suspected adverse r eaction 
that is attributable to study drug, serious, and unexpected . The purpose of the Investigator letter 
is to fulfill specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the EC. 
The Sponsor is responsible for informing ECs, Investigators, and regulatory authorities of 
finding that could adversely affect the safety of subjects or affect  the conduct of the study . 
Events will be reported to regulatory authorities in accordance with expedited and period 
reporting requirements . 
8.4.4.  Pregnancy Reporting  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be withdrawn from the study 
immediately . Female subject s who become pregnant within 28  days after receiving study drug 
should also notify the Investigator . The Investigator must attempt to follow the pregnancy to 
term or termination in order to report on outcome and health status of mother and c hild. 
The Investigator must notify t he Sponsor of any pregnancy within 24  hours after the Investigator 
becomes aware of it  using the SAE reporting procedures outlined in Section  8.4.1 . 
8.5. Safety Oversight  
The internal, blinded Product Safety and Risk Management Committee will monitor safety data 
on a periodic basis throughout the study , (ie, monthly unless more frequent monitoring is 
necessary due to high enrollment or safety concern), including r egular review of ECG findings, 
Holter monitor safety alerts, AEs, and SAEs . ECGs and AEs will be reviewed to identify 
possible signs of LAST.  
The stopping criteria, enrollment suspension or study termination for safety issues, are provided 
in Section  13.5.

9.1. Prohibited Medications  
Antiemetic medications may be given to treat nausea and/or vomiting, but should not be 
administered prophylactically (ie, as a routine preventative in the absence of signs or symptoms 
of nausea  or vomiting ). 
With the exception of preoperative administration of pregabalin  and acetaminophen  (in Cohort 2 
only) , intraoperative administration of study drug  (including ropivacaine in 1 arm in Cohort 2)  
and f entanyl, opioid rescue medications specified in Section  3.1.3 , and ASA for DVT 
prophylaxis , no other analgesic agents, including  ketamine and  NSAI Ds, are permitted from 
signing the ICF through 72  hours after study drug administration, except under the f ollowing 
circumstances:  
 To treat an AE . 
 For pretreatment prior to needle placement . 
 To decrease  venous irritation caused by propofol (in which case, no more than a single 
administration of lidocaine 1% 20  mg IV may be administered).  
After 72  hours, the an algesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually as deemed 
appropriate by the physician responsible for the postoperative care.  
9.2. Contraception  
Female subjects of child -bearing potential with a non -surgically sterile partner must use an 
acceptab le form of contraception in the event of sexual activity during the study and for 30  days 
after study drug administration . Acceptable forms of contraception include double -barrier 
contraception or an insertable, injectable, transdermal, or combination oral  contraceptive.  
9.3. Prohibited Treatment  
CPM  machines are not required in this study; however, if they are to be used, they are not 
allowed within the first 12 hours after study drug administration.

10.1. General Considerations  
All efficacy and safety data will be listed by subject . Baseline is defined as the last observed 
measurement, whether scheduled or unscheduled, prior to study drug administration . All safety 
and efficacy endpoints will be summarized by treatment group and/ or cohort, as appropriate. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of subjects with data (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Selected continuous variable 
summaries will also in clude the standard error (SE). Categorical variables will be summarized 
using fre quency counts and percentages.  
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical hypothesis te sting will be two -sided using α  = 0.05.  
10.2. Determination of Sample Size  
Cohort 1: The sample size of up to approximately 60 subjects was selected empirically without 
formal statistical assumption s. 
Cohort 2: The mean (SD) AUC 0-48 in the saline placebo and HTX -011 400 mg groups after 
adjusting for opioid rescue medication use is expected to be approximately 425 (90) and 
365 (90), respectively. Using a 2 -sample t -test, 50 subjects per treatment group results in 
approximately 90% power to detect a statistically sign ificant treatment effect with α  = 0.05, 
2-sided.  
10.3. Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : All su bjects who are randomized and receive study drug  will be 
included in the ITT Population . This population will be used as the primary analysis population 
for all efficacy endpoints. The randomized treatment assignment will be used for analysis in this 
popul ation.   
Safety Population : All subjects who receive study drug will be included in the Safety Population . 
This population will be used for all summaries of safety data . The actual treatment received will 
be used for analysis in this population.  
10.4. Statistical  Analysis Methods  
10.4.1.  Disposition  and Demographics  
The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis population will be summarized. Subject  
disposition, including the number of subjects  screened, rando mized, dosed, completing the 
72-hour postoperative observation period , completing Day 28, and not completing Day 28 by 
reason for withdrawal will be summarized for the ITT Population . Subject  demographics and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT Population and will include age, age 
categ ory, sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI.

Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  10.4.2.  Efficacy Analysis  
Cohorts 1 and 2 will be analyzed separately with no data pooling across cohorts.  
In Cohort 1, each arm of HTX -011 will be tested against each control arm.   
In Cohort 2, the following tre atment comparisons will be performed in a hierarchical order for 
the primary and key secondary endpoint s: 
1. Mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg (13.7 mL) via 
periarticular instillation and ropivacaine 50 mg via periarticular injection vs. saline placebo . 
2. Mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg (13.7 mL) via 
periarticular instillation vs. saline placebo . 
3. Mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg (13.7 mL) via 
periarticular instillation and ropivacaine 50 mg via periarticular injection vs. saline placebo . 
4. Mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg (13.7 mL) via 
periarticular instillation vs.  saline  placebo . 
In order to account for multiple treatment comparisons on the primary and key secondary 
endpoint s in Cohort 2, a strict testing hierarchy will be applied to control study -wise alpha level 
at 0.05. If the first treatment comparison is statisticall y significant (p≤0.05), then the second  
treatment comparison will be tested. If the second  treatment comparison is statistically 
significant, then the third  treatment comparison will be tested. Sequential testing will continue in 
this manner down the hiera rchical order until a treatment comparison fails to meet statistical 
significance, after which all subsequent treatment comparisons will be considered exploratory.  
10.4.2.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary analysis of mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores will be carried out on 
the ITT Population using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as th e main 
effect. Results will be expres sed as mean AUCs and SDs, least -squares mean differences and 
SEs with ass ociated 95%  confidence intervals (CIs), and p -values.  To account for the duration 
effect of opioid rescue medication, the windowed worst observation carried forward (wWOCF) 
method will be implemented as the primary analysis method for endpoints involving NRS pain 
intensity  scores. In this method, pain intensity scores observed during the analgesic window 
(duration of effect) of any opioid rescue medication will be replaced with the worst (highest) 
postdose nonmissing NRS pain intensity score observed prior to the rescue med ication window, 
with the following exception: if the NRS pain intensity score for a windowed observation is 
higher than the worst pre -window score, then it will not be replaced. Sensitivity analyses for 
endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores will an alyze the data without adjustment for the 
effect of opioid rescue medications.  
10.4.2.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly to that specified for the 
primary endpoint.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 71 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Categorical endpoints will be analyzed  using Fisher’s exact test. Results will be expressed as the 
number and percentage of subjects meeting the relevant endpoint, differences in proportio ns with 
95% CIs, and p -values.  
Median time in hours to first opioid rescue administration will be analyzed  using Kaplan -Meier 
methods.  
10.4.2.3.  Handling of Missing Data  
Due to the required 72 -hour inpatient post -surgery observation period, the amount of missing 
data is expected to be very low. For any missing data observed , NRS  pain intensity scores will be 
imputed via  last obs ervation carried forward (LOCF) , in which the most recent  post-dose 
non-missing value is used for a subsequent missing value. For subjects who do not have a 
postdose value prior to their first missing value, the median of the postdose values at the relevant 
timepoint from subjects with observed data in the same randomized treatment group will be 
used. Predose values will not be carried forwar d to postdose timepoints. Analyses that adjust for 
the effect of opioid rescue medication will perform wWOCF following LOCF (ie, perform 
LOCF first, then apply wWOCF ). 
Other continuous efficacy endpoints with missing data will be handled using LOCF. In gen eral, 
subjects with missing categorical data at a timepoint will be assumed to have not met the 
endpoint at that timepoint. For the analysis of time to first opioid rescue medication, subjects 
who withdraw from the study  prior to completing the 72 -hour pos toperative observation period  
or complete the 72-hour postoperative observation period without having taken rescue 
medication will be censored at the time of study withdrawal or completion  of the 72 -hour 
postoperative observation period, whichever is earli er. 
10.4.3.  Safety Analysis  
All safety analyses will be carried out on the Safety Population.  All safety data will be listed and 
summarized by treatment group .  
AEs will be monitored during the study  and the data analyzed with respect to incidence within 
each trea tment group as well as severity and potential relationship of the AEs to study drug . AEs 
that occur between the time the subject signs the ICF and the start of study drug administration 
will be considered pretreatment AEs. AEs that start during or after study drug administration, or 
AEs with an onset prior to study drug administration that worsen after study drug administration 
will be considered TEAEs. All TEAEs will be coded and tabulated by System Organ Class and 
Preferre d Term. Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized and presented in descending 
order of frequency accor ding to the highest dose of HTX -011 studied . AEs leading to study 
withdrawal, if a ny, will be listed separately.  
Associated laboratory parameters suc h as hepatic profile, renal function, and hematology values 
will be grouped and presented together  in summary tables . For each laboratory test, individual 
values outside the standard reference range will be flagged and listed. Shift tables will be 
produced  showing the frequency of shifts from Baseline to the lowest and to the highest on -study 
value in and out of the normal range as well as by visit. Laboratory parameters will also be 
summarized by visit.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 72 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  The change from Baseline to each visit for each of th e vital sign variables will be summarized. 
Abnormal vital sign values will be flagged and listed.  
Wound healing assessment and proportion of subje cts able to complete a timed 20 -meter walk 
test will be summarized at each timepoint.  
10.4.4.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Plasma bupivacaine and meloxicam concentrations will be determined using validated liquid 
chromatography tandem -mass spectrometry assays . Concentrations will be calculated by 
interpolation from a calibration curve . PK parameter estimates will be calculate d using 
noncompartmental analysis.  
10.5. Interim Analysis  
One interim analys is will be performed. An internal IRC will review unblinded summary -level 
data from Cohort 1 to make study design decisions , as outlined in Section  3.1.2 . The i nterim 
analysis will be performed after  at least 80% of the planned number of subjects in Cohort  1 have 
all of their pain intensity and opioid use data through t he 72 -hour postoperative assessments 
entered into electronic clinical database.  The internal IRC will be composed of 1  Sponsor 
representative from the Clinical Research, Biometrics, Pharmacovigilance, Regulatory, and 
Pharmaceutical and Translational Scienc es functions. The IRC will operate under a written, 
detailed IRC Charter.  
There will be no interim analyses on data collected during Cohort  2.

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Appendix F: Overall Benefit of Analgesia Assessment  
 
Sites will ask each subject the statements listed below , and the rating scale below will be used to 
calculate the overall OBAS score.  
  Rating  
1 Please rate your current pain at rest on a scale between 0=minimal 
pain and 4=maximum imaginable pain  |__| 
2 Please grade any distress and bother from vomiting in the past 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4=very much)  |__| 
3 Please grade any distress and bother from itching in the past 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4=very much)  |__| 
4 Please grade any distress and bother from sweating in the past 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4=very much)  |__| 
5 Please grade any distress and bother from freezing in the past 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4=very much)  |__| 
6 Please grade any distress and bother fr om dizziness in the past 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4=very much)  |__| 
7 How satisfied are you with your pain treatment during the past 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4= very much)?  4 - |__| = |__|  
 Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score:  |__|__|  
To calculate the OBAS  score, compute the sum of the scores in items 1 through 6 and add  
‘4-score in item 7’  
Example OBAS calculation: A subject patient with minimal pain (NRS=0), severe 
vomiting (NRS=4), and no itching, sweating, and freezing who is slightly dizzy (NRS=1), 
and is not very satisfied with his postoperative pain treatment (NRS=1) has an OBAS of 8.  
Note that a low score indicates high benefit.

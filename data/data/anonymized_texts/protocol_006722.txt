What is the purpose of this research study?  
You are  being asked to participate in this  research study because you are part of 
one of two groups of patients : 
1. You are attending your first visit at  the Penn Epilepsy Center  (PEC)  to 
learn about your seizures or seizure -like events.  
2. You have been admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania 
for continuous video Electroencephalography  (cVEEG) monitori ng. 
We hope  that this study will help us learn whether a blood test can help doctors 
diagnose epilepsy (more than one unprovoked seizure). In this form, the word 
“seizure” refers to the seizure -like events that you experience, regardless of your 
doctor’s e ventual diagnosis.  
Please read this form carefully for more information about the study and ask the 
study team about any questions that you have.  If you decide to join the study, 
you will receive a signed copy of this form for your records.  
 
How is this s tudy being funded?  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided a grant to Cognizance 
Biomarkers, LLC, to carry out this study. The Principal Investigator, Dr. John 
Pollard, is a part owner of Cognizance Biomarkers, and the University of 
Pennsylvania o wns the patent for the blood test being studied.

Version 2: April 26, 2015   Page 2 of 8 How long will I be in the study? How many other people will be 
in the study?  
We think that t he whole study will last about two  years. Your active participation 
will begin when you sign this consent form an d end after you give  you last blood 
sample for research. If you choose to give a single blood sample, this will happen 
on the same day that you sign this consent form; if you choose to give multiple 
blood samples, this will happen within one year after you  sign this consent form. 
Please continue reading this form for more information about the blood draws.  
We will continue to enroll until 240 people have joined the study  in the PEC’s  
outpatient clinic  and have given usable blood samples for the study .   
At any time, you may decide to leave the study and tell the st udy team to destroy 
your blood sample . If you decide to leave the study, please contact the 
investigator. You may contact him by phone or mail using the address and 
number at the top of this page.   
 
What am I being asked to do?  
Subjects may join the study at one of two types of visits, described below.  
It is important to remember that all blood samples are optional. You may join the 
study and then decide that you do not want to give blood at any ti me, for any 
reason.  
1. Subjects who join during an outpatient visit at the PEC  
If you decide to join this study , we will ask you to give  a single sample of 
about one teaspoon (or 15ml) of blood during your first vis it to the Penn 
Epilepsy Center. We will draw  the blood thr ough a needle inserted into a 
vein in one of your arms.  This sample  will be  used  for research purposes 
only (it will not be used for your regular clinical care) . 
You may also decide to provide blood samples for research at the 
following times : 
• If you are admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania 
for cVEEG monitoring at a later date, you may be asked to give up 
to two blood samples for research per day (12:00am – 11:59pm). 
These samples would consist of one per day, and an addi tional 
sample if you experience a seizure or seizure -like event.  
CARPE, Cognizance  
 
Version 2: April 26, 2015   Page 3 of 8 • If you attend one or more follow -up visits at the PEC  during the 
year after you sign this form, you may provide an additional blood 
sample for research at each visit.  
2. Subjects who join during  an admission for cVEEG monitoring:  
If you are admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for 
cVEEG monitoring at a later date, you may be asked to give up to two 
blood samples for research per day (12:00am – 11:59pm). These samples 
would c onsist of one per day, and an additional sample if you experience 
a seizure or seizure -like event.  
If you attend one or more follow -up visits at the PEC during the year after 
you sign this form, you may provide an additional blood sample for 
research at ea ch visit.

bruising, bleeding, diz ziness, and a burning feeling.  Rarely, people may also 
exper ience fainting or an infection at the site where the needle is inserted to take 
the blood sample.

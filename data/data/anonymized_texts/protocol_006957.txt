Tampon Study Proposal  
 
Abstract  
 
To date, a great deal of work has been done to characterize the composition of the vaginal 
microbiota (VMB) in women of reproductive age. While several different community types have 
been identified, it is widely accepted that communities dominated by Lactobacillus  spp confer 
colonization resistance, and thus protect against bacterial vaginosis (BV), STI, and other 
urogenital infectious diseases [Hickey 2012]. Conversely, mixed communities that often include 
Gardnerella vaginalis , Prevotella  spp., Mycoplasm a spp., and/or Gram -positive cocci  and 
relatively few Lactobacillus  spp are considered unhealthy states and may contribute to BV and 
various sequelae including infertility, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and increased 
risk of STI [Hickey 2012] . Considering both the relationship between VMB composition and 
reproductive health, and the high prevalence of tampon use, which, for many women, occurs at 
regular intervals for the duration of their reproductive life, it is surprising how few studies hav e 
examined the effect of tampon use on VMB composition. Moreover, the majority of these studies 
are limited by the use of culture -dependent methods focused on the presence/absence of a small 
number of species ( Lactobacillus  spp, Staphylococcus aureus , E. coli, group B Streptococcus , 
and/or Gardnerella vaginalis ) [Onderdonk 1986, Onderdonk 1987, Chow 1989, Shehin 2003, 
Chase 2007, Chase 2010, Hochwalt 2010]. The one study to date that has used culture -
independent VMB community analysis in response to tampon use was limited by its sample size 
of 7 women. Further, the investigators only collected vaginal swabs at two points during each 
menstrual cycle [Hickey 2013]. The conflicting findings of these studies make this an even more 
compelling research question. I n order to address this striking knowledge gap, we propose a 
longitudinal,  interventional,  case-crossover study design to examine whether  expanded tampon 
shape  affects VMB composition during, and in between menses. We will recruit 20 women from 
the Univers ity of Michigan , Ann Arbor  to use  Tampax®  Pearl®  Regular Tampons  (expand into 
a rectangular prism -like shape)  and Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampons  (expand 
into a conical shape)  for one menstrual cycle each, in a randomly assigned order. We will  obtain 
twice -weekly self -collected vaginal swabs for a 2 -3 week baseline window before the first 
menstrual cycle with an assigned tampon, followed by the two menstrual cycles with assigned 
tampon use, and finishing with one menstrual cycle with menstrual product use  according to 
each subject’s  normal habits. DNA will be isolated from the vaginal swabs, and the bacterial 16S 
rRNA encoding genes will be amplified by PCR. Sequencing will be performed using the MiSeq 
Illumina platform, and analyzed to answer t he above questions. We hypothesize that VMB 
composition will vary between menses using the Tampax®  Pearl® Regular  Tampons and 
Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampons , and that persistence of  these VMB changes 
will vary based on baseline VMB community type.  
 
Background  
 
To date, a great deal of work has been done to characterize the composition of the vaginal 
microbiota (VMB) in women of reproductive age. While many bacterial genuses have been 
identified in VMB samples, it is widely accepted that commun ities dominated by Lactobacillus  
spp promote a healthy vaginal environment and good reproductive health [reviewed in Hickey 
2012]. The primary function of Lactobacilli in promoting vaginal health is the provision of 
colonization resistance to the vaginal e pithelium [Borovkova 2011, Lopes 2011, Borges 2014, 
reviewed in Hickey 2012]. Through the production of lactic acid, Lactobacilli  create an acidic 
environment, which prevents the proliferation of nonindigenous organisms, including pathogens 
and those assoc iated with BV [Cook 1990, Boskey 1999, Aroutcheva 2001, Valore 2002, Atassi 
2006, Kaewsrichan 2006, O’Hanlon 2010, Borges 2014, reviewed in Hickey 2012]. However, it 
has been noted in multiple studies that a low abundance of Lactobacilli  does not necessari ly 
translate to poor vaginal health [Gajer 2012, Martin 2012]. This has lead to the recent hypothesis 
that it is not the presence of Lactobacilli  in abundance that promotes vaginal health, but instead it 
is the capacity of the VMB to produce lactic acid, w hich can be accomplished by several taxa 
normally isolated from the VMB including Atopobium , Streptococcus , Staphylococcus , 
Megasphaera , and Leptotrichia [Hickey 2012]. Despite the fact that diverse VMB that are not 
dominated by Lactobacilli  have been foun d in asymptomatic women with good vaginal health, 
this is not the norm. It is widely accepted that mixed VMB including Gardnerella vaginalis , 
Prevotella  spp., Mycoplasma  spp., and/or Gram -positive cocci  and relatively few Lactobacilli  
are considered unheal thy states and are often present in women with BV [Spiegel 1980, Amsel 
1983, both Spiegel 1983, Hill 1993, Falagas 2007, Cribby 2008, Lopes 2011, Hickey 2012]. BV 
imposes a large burden on the healthcare system both directly and indirectly. Directly, it is  the 
most common vaginal disorder of reproductive age women and results in millions of healthcare 
visits each year in the US alone [Sobel 2005, Koumans 2007]. Indirectly, BV is associated with a 
great number of serious sequelae including, but not limited t o, infertility [Sweet 1995], 
endometritis [Haggerty 2004], and pelvic inflammatory disease [Wiesenfeld 2002]; as well as an 
increased risk of acquiring HIV and other STIs [Hillier 1998, Taha 1998, Martin 1999, Schmid 
2000, Wiesenfeld 2003].  
 
A considerabl e volume of work has also been conducted to characterize the fluctuations of the 
VMB across the menstrual cycle. While some studies (both culture -dependent and culture -
independent) have reported no change in community composition across the menstrual cycle  
[Sautter 1980, Wilks 1987, Gajer 2012, Hickey 2013], others have reported varying relative 
abundances of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria across the cycle [Bartlett 1977] or a greater 
proportion of non -Lactobacillus  species during menses [Priestley 1997, Eschenbach 2000, 
Srinivasan 2010, Lopes 2011, Gajer 2012, Hickey 2013]. In light of these findings, in particular 
those of Gajer et al. (2012) and Hickey et al. (2013), it is currently thought that the degree and 
type of VMB fluctuation seen across the menstrual cycle varies between women [Lopes 2011, 
Chaban 2014]. Further, the increased abundance of non -Lactobacilli  species seen during menses 
is of particular interest given the changes to vaginal innate immune cell p resence [Hill 1992], 
temperature [Hill 2010], oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations [Hill 2005], and volatile fatty 
acid concentrations [Preti 1975] that occur during menses. These changes alter the growth 
conditions present in the vagina, and as such, may promote the growth of certain bacterial 
species over others. Given that non -Lactobacilli  species are often present in greater abundance 
during menses, it is possible that the conditions of the vagina during menses could promote their 
growth and potenti ally shift a Lactobacilli -dominated VMB to a diverse VMB and promote BV. 
Moreover, the changes to vaginal temperature, dissolved gas concentrations, and volatile fatty 
acid concentrations that occur during menses have been show n to be exacerbated by tampon  use 
[Preti 1975, Hill 2005, Hill 2010], suggesting that tampon use may compound any VMB changes 
that occur during menses.  
 
Considering the well -established link between VMB composition and vaginal health, the VMB 
fluctuations seen over the course of the m enstrual cycle, the changes to the vaginal environment 
that occur during menses (which are exacerbated by tampon use), and the high prevalence of 
tampon use (it is estimated that as many as 81% of reproductive age women in the US use 
tampons [Omar 1998]); surprisingly few studies have examine d the effects of tampon use during 
menses on VMB composition. The majority of these studies are limited by the use of culture -
dependent methods focused on the presence/absence of a small number of species ( Lactobacillus  
spp, Staphylococcus aureus , E. coli , group B Streptococcus , and/or Gardnerella vaginalis ) 
[Onderdonk 1986, Onderdonk 1987, Chow 1989, Shehin 2003, Chase 2007, Chase 2010, 
Hochwalt 2010]. The one study to date that has used culture -independent VMB communit y 
analysis in response to tampon use was limited by its sample size of 7 women. Further, the 
investigators only collected vaginal swabs at two points during each menstrual cycle [Hickey 
2013]. Not only are these studies severely limited by their designs, b ut they have also failed to 
produce consistent findings on the impact of tampon use on VMB composition. This knowledge 
gap represents a major shortcoming of public health research to identify and describe the effect 
of a near -ubiquitous modifiable risk fac tor on vaginal health. Addressing this gap has the 
potential to improve individuals’ vaginal health through public health interventions, and decrease 
the societal burden of poor vaginal health, namely due to BV.  
 
We propose a longitudinal,  interventional,  case-crossover study design to examine whether  
expanded tampon shape  affects VMB composition  during, and in between menses. We will 
recruit 20 women from the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor  to use  Tampax®  Pearl®  Regular 
Tampons  (expand into a rectangula r prism -like shape)  and Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® 
Regular Tampons  (expand into a conical shape) for one menstrual cycle each, in a randomly 
assigned order. We will obtain twice -weekly self -collected vaginal swabs for a 2 -3 week baseline 
window before th e first menstrual cycle with an assigned tampon, followed by the two menstrual 
cycles with assigned tampon use, and finishing with one menstrual cycle with menstrual product 
use according to each subject’s  normal habits. DNA will be isolated from the vagin al swabs, and 
the bacterial 16S rRNA encoding genes will be amplified by PCR. Sequencing will be performed 
using the MiSeq Illumina platform, and analyzed to answer the above questions.  
 
Outcomes and aims  
 
 Primary Outcome: Change in relative abundance of Lactobacillus  species from : baseline 
to the end of first menstrual cycle, baseline to the end of second menstrual cycle, and 
baseline to the end of third menstrual cycle (approximately 14 weeks)  
 Secondary Outcome: Change in relative abundance of Gardnerell a vaginalis  from : 
baseline to the end of first menstrual cycle, baseline to the end of second menstrual cycle, 
and baseline to the end of third menstrual cycle (approximately 14 weeks)  
 Exploratory Outcomes  
 To characterize intra -woman , during -menses changes  in VMB composition caused  by 
(see Methods – Study  Design and Methods – Whole  Community Analysis & 
Statistics sections for notes on causal infer ence)  changing the expanded tampon shape  
of tampon used . 
o Hypothesis  1: VMB composition will vary between menses with Tampax®  
Pearl ® Regular Tampon use and  Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular 
Tampon  use because the different  expanded shapes of the two tampons  will 
alter the vaginal environment differently and thus promote growth of different 
taxonomic groups . The primary structural difference between Tampax® 
Pearl ® Regular Tampons  and Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular 
Tampons is that, once inserted into the vagina, Tampax® Pearl ® Regular 
Tampons  expand axially into a rectangular prism -like shape, while Play tex® 
Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampons expand radially into a conical  shape. 
The radial expansion of the Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampons 
likely results in increased surface area of the tampon that is in contact with the 
vaginal epithelium as  compared to the Tampax® Pearl ® Regular Tampons . 
This may allow for increased absorption of menses by the Playtex ® Gentle 
Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampons as compared to the Tampax® Pearl ® 
Regular Tampons , resulting in differing growth conditions in the vagina  
during Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampon use and Tampax® 
Pearl® Regular Tampon use.  
 To characterize intra -woman , between -menses  changes in VMB composition caused  
by (see Methods – Study  Design and Methods – Whole  Community Analysis & 
Statistics sections for notes on causal infer ence)  changing  the expanded shape  of 
tampon used . 
o Hypothesis  2.1: Persistence of VMB changes observed during menses caused 
by changing the expanded shape of the tampon used will vary dependent  on 
baseline VMB community typ e such that VMB changes will persist for 
greater time between menses in women with typically diverse VMB that 
confer reduced colonization resistance compared to a Lactobacilli  dominated 
VMB [Borovkova 2011, Lopes 2011, Borges 2014, reviewed in Hickey 2012] . 
o Hypothesis 2.2: Within women with Lactobacilli  dominated baseline VMB, 
persistence of VMB changes observed during menses caused by changing 
expanded tampon shape  will vary based on the degree of reduction of 
Lactobacilli  abundance during menses such that  changes resulting in greater 
reductions of Lactobacilli  abundance will persist for greater time between 
menses.  
 
Methods  
 
 Recruitment  
 We will r ecruit 40  women from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor  during the 
Winter 2017 semester . 
o We will make an in -person  announcement  in Women’s Studies 400: 
Women’s Reproductive Health  (taught by Dr. Tim Johnson, Dept. of 
OB/GYN) according to the following script:  
 Hello everyone, we are here to recruit forty  healthy female 
students to participate in our study examini ng the impact of 
changing tampon use on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. 
The study period will consist of a baseline window after a subject’s  
last period and three full menstrual cycles. For the first two 
menstrual cycles, each subject  will use Tampax®  Pearl ® Regular 
Tampons  and Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampons  
for one menstrual cycle each, in a randomly assigned order . For the 
third menstrual cycle, each subject  will use menstrual products 
according to their normal habits. For the cou rse of the study, 
approximately 4 months, subjects  will self -collect vaginal swabs 
twice a week. These samples will be used for bacterial community 
analysis to assess the composition of the vaginal microbiota at each 
time point, and compare composition dur ing periods using 
different tampons and determine how long these changes persist 
between periods. For the first two menstrual cycl es, the study 
tampons and Always ® Infinity ® Regular Pads will be provided to 
subjects  free of charge. Additionally, each subje ct will receive  $20. 
In order to be eligible to participate in this study, you must be at 
least 18 years old, have regular menstrual cycles that last 3 -5 
weeks with periods that last for at least 4 days, currently use 
tampons, and be in good general and va ginal health. You are 
ineligible to participate if you are pregnant or planning on 
becoming pregnant in the next 4 months, if you have difficulty 
using tampons, if you currently have or have had toxic shock 
syndrome (TSS), if you currently have a sexually transmitted 
infection (STI) or urinary tract infection (UTI), if are currently 
using antibiotics or antifungals or have used antibiotics or 
antifungals within the last month, or if you have an autoimmune 
condition. If you are interested in participating in  this study , please 
email (kaycart@umich.edu ) and then we will set up an enrollment 
meeting.  
o We will also pass out flyers describing the objective of the study, the 
duration of subject participation, subject responsibilities, subject 
compensation, eligibility requirements, and exclusion criteria. It will also 
include the email address for setting up enrollment meetings.  We will also 
post these flyers at the Michigan Union and other places around central 
campus.  
o We will also post the study in UMHealt hResearch.org.  
o We will respond to interest emails ac cording to the following script  in 
order to set up enrollment meetings with each interested student:  
 Dear [name],  
 
Thank you for your interest in participating in this study. The next 
step is to set up an  enrollment meeting at which you will be 
assigned a random study ID number, review the informed consent 
document for the study, give informed consent to participate in the 
study if you choose to, complete an online enrollment survey, and 
receive the tampon s, pads, and vaginal swabs for the study. The 
following times are available for the enrollment meeting:  
 
Monday 9:30 AM – 4:15 PM  
Tuesday 1:30 PM – 4:00 PM  
Wednesday 11:00 AM – 4:15 PM  
Thursday 1:30 PM – 4:15 PM  
 
Please respond to this email with your pref erred day and time for 
the enrollment meeting. The meeting will take approximately 30 
minutes.  
 
Thanks  
o At the enrollment meeting we will obtain informed consent from each 
student, assign a random ID number to the student, administer the baseline 
survey (as sess eligibility, collects data on covariates (covered in Methods 
subse ction Study Design)) on a l ab computer using Qualtrics, review 
subject responsibilities with each student, and distribute study materials 
including 30 vaginal swabs, vaginal swab instru ctions, 30 collection day 
surveys, 24 Tampax® Pearl® Regular Tampons, 24 Playtex® Gentle 
Glide® 360°® Regular Tampons, 24 Always® Infinity® Regular Pads 
with wings to each subject. All research data will be kept in files that 
include the subject ID number,  but not name or other information that is 
likely to allow someone other than the researchers to link the data to a 
subject. These files will be maintaine d in a password protected l ab file 
manager. We will enroll the first 20 eligible students who schedule  an 
enrollment meeting.  
 Inclusion criteria: Subjects  must be 18 years of age or older;  have  regular 
menstrual cycles lasting 21 -35 days with menses for at least 4 days;  be a current 
tampon user;  be in  self-reported good general health;  and be in  self-repor ted good 
vaginal health . 
 Exclusion criteria: Respondents will be excluded if they are pregnant or  are 
planning on becoming pregnant during the study; have  difficulty using tampons; 
currently have, or have had TSS ; current ly have an  STI; current ly have a  UTI; are 
currently using current antibiotic s, or used antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to 
enrollment; are currently using current antifungals , or used antifungals within 4 
weeks prior to enrollment;  or have an autoimmune  condition . 
 
 Study Design  
 This study will be a l ongitudinal, interventional, case -crossover s tudy with three 
exposure levels:  
o Experimental exposure l evels: Each subject  will use Tampax® Pearl® 
Regular Tampons  and Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular 
Tampons  for one menstrual cycle each, in a randomly assigned order . 
o Control exposure level: Each subject  will use  menstrual product s 
according to their normal habits  for a third menstrual cycle.  
o A case-crossover design ensures exchangeability between treatment 
windows within each subject  for all ti me invariant characteristics. 
Under exchangeability and the assumptions of an intent -to-treat 
analysis (covered in Methods – Whole Community Analysis & 
Statistics) , the actual outcome observed under one treatment for an 
individual equals the counterfactual  outcome under that treatment for 
that individua l, so association between  expanded  tampon shape  and 
VMB composition represents a causal relationship. T his study design 
and the intent -to-treat analytic  strategy  will allow us to make causal 
inference in refe rence to the effect of expanded tampon shape  on VMB 
composition . 
 Vaginal swabs will be self -collected by each subject  twice  week ly for four 
different exposure windows  (Fig. 1) : 
o A 2-3 week baseline window after  the last men strual period prior to  
enroll ment; 4 -6 baseline samples per subject . 
o One menstrual cycle  using  the Tampax®  Pearl® Regular  Tampon s; 8 
samples . 
o One menstrual cycle using Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular 
Tampons ; 8 samples.  
o The final menstrual cycle  with menstrual product use accordi ng to the 
subject’s  normal habits; 8 samples for the subject’s  normal habits . 
 
 
Figure 1: Study design.  
 
 We will administer a  baseline survey  using the online survey system Qualtrics  to 
obtain information on covariates including age; race; normal menstrua l product 
use (types of products used; frequency of use of different products; specific 
tampon details including brand, perfume, absorbency); hygiene habits (douching, 
use of scented soaps); contraception use (current and past use of hormonal 
methods, curr ent use of other methods); sexual activity (types of current and past, 
sex of partners, number of lifetime partners, frequency, use of lubricant); social 
history (smoking, drinking, yogurt); obstetric/gynecological history (medical 
problems, pregnancies an d outcomes, first day of last period); medical history 
(medical problems, height, weight, surgic al history, current medications ). 
o We had 100% completion in our pilot and expect a similar completion 
rate in the proposed stu dy (HUM 00098494 ).

Figure 3: Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampons. A) Tampon in applicator and

 Justification for choice of tampons A and B: The primary structural difference 
between Tampax® Pearl ® Regular Tampons  and Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® 
Regular Tampons is that, once inserted into the vagina, Tampax® Pearl ® Regular 
Tampons  expand axially into a rectangular prism -like shape  (Fig. 2C) , while 
Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampons expand radially into a cone -
like shape  (Fig. 3C) . The radial expansion of the Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® 
Regular Tampo ns likely results in increased surface area of the tampon that is in 
contact with the vaginal epithelium as compared to the Tampax® Pearl ® Regular 
Tampons . This may allow for increased absorption of menses by the Playtex ® 
Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampon s as compared to the Tampax® Pearl ® 
Regular Tampons , resulting in differing growth conditions in the vagina during 
A 
C B 
Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular Tampon use and Tampax® Pearl® 
Regular Tampon use. Both tampons are inserted with a plastic applicator, and 
both are made of a cotton/rayon blend. The only other substantial structural 
difference between the two is that the Tampax® Pearl ® Regular Tampons  have a 
braided string   (Fig. 2 B) while the Playtex ® Gentle Glide ® 360° ® Regular 
Tampons have a straight, 2  strand string  (Fig 3A) . Tampax® Pearl ® reports that 
the braided string is designed to stop tampon leaks, and that it can hold up to 12 
drops of fluid in addition to the volume held by the tampon  (Fig. 2D) . We do not 
anticipate this difference to substantially alter the growth conditions in the vagina 
because any contact between the string (braided or not) and the vaginal epithelium 
will be much less than that between the actual tampon and the vaginal epithel ium. 
Another reason for choosing these tampons is that , for the past 6 years (2011 -
2016), Tampax®  and Playtex ® brand tampons have been the two most used 
tampon brands in the US [Experian 2016 ]. Examining how these tampon brands 
impact VMB composition will increase the generalizability of the study findings , 
as compared to if we selected other tampon brands.

 Distribution: Subjects  will receive  their study tampons and pads  during their 
enrollment meeting . 
 We will instruct subjects  to use  the study  tampons as they normally would, not 
wear a tampon for more than 8 hours, not wear more than one tampon at a time, 
contact a doctor if they experience any serious adverse effects related to tampon 
use including TSS symptoms, remove the tampon prior to coll ecting a swab 
during menses , and use the pads in addition to the tampons if they so choose.  

 We will provide subjects  with written instructions from the ta mpon manufacturer 
on tampon use and ways to minimize risk of TSS.  
 
 Self-Collected Vaginal Swabs  
 As in  our pilot study, a double -headed, dry, rayon  swab  (Starplex Scientific , Inc., 
S09D) wil l be used for sample collection (HUM00098494).  
 Swab distribution: Subjects  will receive  their vaginal swabs  for the duration of the 
study (assumed duration of 15 weeks) during their enrollment meeting . If 
additional swabs are needed, subjects will pick them up from the first floor of 
MSRB1.  
 Swab collection: Subjects  will drop off  their self-collected vaginal sw abs on the 
first floor of MSRB1  during designated time windows each week ; swabs will be 
stored in -80°C  until analysis . 
 Swabbing procedure: A ll swabs will include the following written instructions for 
self-collecting the vaginal swab  (HUM00098494, HUM0008 6661 ): 
1. Read these instructions before starting.  
2. Locate a sterile swab  labeled with your study  ID number  
3. Write today’s date  (the day you used the swab)  in the space 
provided  on the swab label.  Complete the short survey included with 
the swab . It is OK to co llect a sample if you are  menstruating , but if 
you are currently using a tampon, remove it before using the swab . 
4. Wash your hands.  
5. Remove th e sterile  swabs from the tube. Do not let them touch your 
body or any surface.   
6. Gently part your labia and insert both swabs  approximately 2 inches 
into your vagina,  imagining that you are pointing it towards  your lower 
back . 
7. Gently turn the swabs  4 times,  rotating the  swab about  90 degrees with 
each turn.  
8. Remove the swabs taking care to not touch  anywhere on your bod y. 
9. Place  both swabs back into the tube.  
10. Place the tube into the plastic bag. Wash your hands.  
11. Return the swab to the first floor of MSRB1 during one of the 
designated time windows this week.  
 Covariate data collection with each swab: We will provide a short  survey  with 
each swab on which subjects  will record whether the swab was collected during 
menses as well as any changes in sexual activity, hygiene, medication use, general 
health, vaginal health, contraception use, pregnancy, menses since the baseline 
study or prior swab . 
 We will remind subjects  to collect sw abs with twice -weekly text messages, 
emails, or phone calls based on preference.  
 
 Whole Community Analysis &  Statistics  
 DNA will be isolated from vaginal swab samples using a PowerMag  Soil DNA 
isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc.) and an epMotion robot (Eppendorf 
epMotion 5075). The DNA samples will submitted to the University of Michigan 
Center for Microbial Systems Laboratory for amplification and sequencing of the 
V4 region of t he 16S rRNA gene. The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene 
will be amplified using dual -indexing sequencing strategy and sequenced on the 
Illumina MiSeq platform as described by Kozich et al. and Seekatz et al.  After 
sequencing is completed, the 16S rR NA gene sequences will be  processed and 
analyzed using the mothur  software (version 1.34.3) and MiSeq SOP 
(http://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP ). Following sequence processing and 
alignment to the SILVA reference alignment [Preusse 2007], sequences will be  
binned into operational taxonomi c units (OTUs) of 97% sequence identity . In our  
preliminary studies, we were able to detect and distinguish 6 different types 
of Lactobacillus  among the top  OTUs (>2% in at least 1 sample)  from vaginal 
swab samples  using an OTU definition of 3% sequence  difference  with sequences 
from the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.  Relative abundances of OTUs will be  
calculated and we will  test the dependence of within  subject  θYC distances  on 
expanded tampon shape  using Mann -Whitney tests or  Kruskal -Wallis test, as 
dictated by the number of comparisons.  Principal components analysis (PCoA) 
will be  used to visualize θ YC distances between samples  within subjects . The same 
analysis protoc ol was used in our previous studies (HUM00098494, 
HUM00086661 ). 
 Intent to treat analysis: This analytic strategy assumes each subject’s actual 
exposure is exactly as it was assigned (complete compliance with assigned 
interventions, exposure fixed for each subject during each treatment window, 
complete follow -up). The implications of this analytic approach in conjunction 
with the within -subject exchangeability produced by the case -crossover design 
(covered in Method – Study Design section) is that the actual  outcome observed 
under one treatment for a subject equals the counterfactual outcome under that 
treatment for that subject, so association between expanded tampon shape and 
VMB composition represents a causal relationship. This study design and analytic 
strategy will allow us to make causal inference in reference to the effect of 
expanded tampon shape on VMB composition.  
 
Benefits  
 This study will help to provide information on whether the use of tampons is associated 
with changes in the VMB over the course  of a menstrual cycle. If there are associated 
changes in the VMB associated with tampon use then our research could help provide 
information on a potentially modifiable time point to help improve the vaginal health of 
women.  
 
Risks  
 No more than minimal ri sk 
o Discomfort with tampon use - rare - we are recruiting women that are currently 
tampon users . 
o Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) - rare- the rates of TSS with currently available 
tampons are extremely low. Each women will be given manufacturers instructions 
whic h include ways to decrease the risk of TSS.  
o Discomfort with vaginal swab collection - rare- the Starplex swabs have been 
used in numerous trials by our lab without any problems given that the swab is 
considerably smaller than the size of the tampon introdu cer. Additionally, detailed 
instructions on sample collection are provided.  
o Disclosure of subject information - rare- each subject will be provided a unique 
ID for the data collected (samples and surveys). All collected information will be 
maintaine d in a password protected l ab file manager.  
 All recruited wom en in  this trial will be active tampon users and thus we do not foresee 
any likelihood of these risks interfering with the subjects day to day living.

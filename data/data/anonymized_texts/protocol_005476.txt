 AMENDMENT HISTORY : 
Protocol Amendment 1 , Version 2.0, dated 06FEB2018  added a 6-month open -label extension to allow 
subjects to receive ATI -50002 Topical Solution, 0.46% .  In addition, to assist with enro llment and to 
facilitate enrollment of subjects less than 60 years of age, the amendment specifie d that after the first 6 
subjects were enrolled in the study, the blood PK samples w ere no longer collected.  Administrative 
Letters 1  through  5 were incorporated into Protocol Amendment  1.  Administrative Letter #1  (dated 
October 2, 2017)  outlined the change from a single center to a multicenter study, clarified that M689 
would not be measured and that the method for the detection of ATI -50002 in the scalp was a qualified 
method.  Administrative Letter #2  (dated December 19, 2017)  added superficial tape stripping of the scalp 
biopsy site for pharmacokinetic analysis to remove any residual study medication in the upper layers of 
the stratum corne um prior to biopsy.  Administrative Letter #3 (dated January 22, 2018) allowed for a 
decrease in the volume of study medication applied from 4 mL to 1.5 mL to 4 mL, and Administrative 
Letter #4 (dated January 29, 2018) updated the address for Aclaris Thera peutics, Inc.   Administrative  
Letter #5 (dated 03AUG2018 ) clarified the treatment duration  of the Open Label Extension  (OLE)  portion  
of the study  for subjec ts with a gap between Visit 7 and entry into the OLE due to an administ rative 
delay .

Study Medication  Description:  
ATI-50002  Topical Solution, 0.46% 
Vehicle Topical Solution  
Study Objectives:  
Primary:  
To assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  of ATI -50002  Topical 
Solution , 0.46% compared to vehicle in subjects with alopecia universalis (AU) and alopecia totalis 
(AT)   
Secondary Objective s: 
To assess the efficacy of ATI -50002 Topical Solution, 0.46% for the treatment of scalp hair loss and 
eyebrow in subjects with AU or AT.  
 
To assess subject satisfaction following treatment with ATI -50002 Topical Solution, 0.46% for the 
treatment of scalp hair loss  in subjects with AU or AT .  
Study Design:   
During the double -blind period, t his Phase 2, multi center, randomized study is designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability , pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics  of ATI-50002 Topical  Solution in 
subjects with AU and AT .  Subjects will be required to have a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically 
typical, AU or AT  for a duration of at least 6 month s up to and including seven years.  In the double -
blind phase, a  total of approximately 12 subject s will be randomized  to a 2:1 ratio: 
• ATI-50002 Topical  Solution, 0.46%, BID for 28 days  (8 subjects)  
• Vehicle Solution BID for 28 days  (4 subjects)  
 
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for eligibility into the study.  Subjects who meet 
all the entry criteria will be randomized to ATI -50002 Topical S olution , 0.46%  or Vehicle Topical 
Solution and will apply a minimum of  1.5 mLs up to  a maximum of  4 mLs of study medication to the 
entire scalp twice -a-day (BID)  for 28 days  (except for Day 1 and Day 28 when study medication will 
only be applied once a day ). For the first 6 subjects enrolled in the study, b lood samples for 
concentration s of ATI -50002 will be collected on Day 1  (Visit 2)  and Day 28 (Visit 6) at pre-dose and 
1, 2, 4, 8 hours post dose  and on Day 2 (Vi sit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 7) at 24 hours post -dose.  Blood 
samples for immunology will be collected on Day 1 (Visit 2) before study medication application and 
on Day 2 9 (Visit 7) , 24 hours after study medication application  on Day 28 (Visit 6) .  A 4 -mm punc h 
biopsy of the scalp will be obtained to determine the concentration of ATI -50002 in the scalp skin on 
Day 2 (Visit 3) and on Day 29 (Visit 7) 24 hours after study medication application on Day 1 ( Visit 2) 
and on Day 28 (Visit 6).  A 4 -mm punch biopsy will be obtained to determine histology and 
immunology, prior to study medication application on Day 1 (Visit 2) and on Day 29 (Visit 7), 24 
hours after study medication application on Day 28 (Visit 6).  Safety and tolerability will  be evaluated

 at each study visit by assessment of adverse events and vital signs, and at select visits, ECGs and 
clinical laboratory tests will be completed.  
 
Open -Label Extension:  
On Day 29 (Visit 7) subjects who complete Visit 7, continue to meet the en try criteria , have no 
clinically significant AEs or tolerability issues and in the opinion of the investigator have experienced 
or are capable of re -grow ing scalp hair will be eligible to enter a 12-month open -label extension.    In 
the open -label extension, safety, tolerability and efficacy will be assessed.  All subjects enrolled in the 
open -label extension will apply ATI -50002 Topical Solution, 0.46% to the entire scalp, twice daily for 
52 weeks ( 12 months).  In addition, sub jects with eyebrow loss may apply a thin film of study 
medication to the affected eyebrow(s) twice -daily for 52 weeks ( 12 months).  Subjects will be followed  
for safety, tolerability and efficacy as detailed in Section 7.3.  Subjects who decline  or are not eligible 
for the open -label extension should be seen for the Visit 1 6 (Post -treatment) assessments 30 days 
following the Day 28 (Visit 6). The duration of the open -label extension (OLE) should be based on the 
date of the visit that the subject initiated OLE treatment rather than the days from Baseline (Visit 2).  
For subjects who entered the open -label extension and had a gap between Visit 7 and entry into the 
open -label extension due to an administrative delay total study participation may be longer than 400 
days.    
Number of Subject s (planned):  
12 subjects will be enrolled into the study.

 The cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration (CTL), Interferon (IFN -gamma), and hair keratin (KRT) 
ALADIN scores will be calculated for each scalp biopsy sample as previously described in Xing et al, 
2014, Jabbari 2016.  Change in ALADIN scores within individual subjects will be assessed between 
Baseline (Visit 2) , Day 2 9 (Visit 7) and Week 2 8 (Visit  13) for subjects enrolled into the open -label 
extension .  
 
Histology  
Scalp punch -biopsies will be formalin -fixed and paraffin -embedded and will be sectioned both vertically 
and horizontally by a qualified dermatopathologist.  Specimens will be stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) for routine histopathologic evaluation that will include (but is not limited to) diagnosis and 
evaluation of the presence, quantity, location, and quality of any hair, hair follicles, and inflammatory 
infiltrate present.  Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC ) stains will be employed to identify immune 
cell populations ( e.g., Lympho cytes, cytotoxic T -lymphocytes [CTLs] ), and hair -specific keratins.  IHC 
stains to assess inflammatory responses will include (but not be limited to) CD8, HLA -DR and ICAM -
1.  Data w ill be presented as percent change from baseline  in the number of cells/ high power field in 
regions of interest (peribulbar areas) and in percent change from baseline in the number of cells/mm2.

Blood samples will be stained with cel l surface antibodies for fluorescence acquisition cell sorting 
(FACS) analysis.  FAC S experiments will allow for assessment of the subset and activation status of 
immune cells involved in AA.  
 
Safety Data  
Safety analyses will include descriptive statistics calculated on the safety parameters using the safety 
population. The proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated and 
presented by treatment and Medical Dictionary for R egulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ 
Class. Vital signs and clinically significant  abnormal laboratory results will also be tabulated an d 
presented by treatment group. Overall incidence of adverse events will be compared between groups 
using a chi-square test.  
 
Data from all randomized and treated subjects will be presented and summarized. Safety summaries by 
study treatment group will include listings by study medication of adverse events incidences within 
each MedDRA System Organ Class, and ch anges from pre -application values in vital signs. Adverse 
event summaries will be presented by study medication showing the proportion of subjects 
experiencing adverse events, both overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class.

 INTRODUCTION  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  is developing ATI -50002  Topical Solution for the  treatment of alopecia 
areata .  ATI -50002 is a potent highly selective inhibitor of Janu s kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kin ase 
3 (JAK3).  
 
3.1. Summary  
Overview of Alopecia Areata  
 
Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune dermatologic condition , which , in its mildest form , is 
typically characterized by patchy non -scarring hair loss on the scalp and/or body.  More severe 
forms of AA include total scalp hair loss, known as alopecia totalis (AT), and total loss of all the 
hair on the scalp and body - import antly, including loss of eyebrows, eyelashes, and intranasal hair - 
known as alopecia universalis (AU).  While spontaneous regrowth of hair is common in the milder 
form of AA (patchy), where the hair loss may wax and wane, in patients with the extensive hai r 
loss of AT or AU, spontaneous hair regrowth is rare.  AA affects both males and females across 
all ethnic groups and is a  prevalent autoimmune disease in the United State s, with a lifetime risk 
of 1.7%  (Safavi 1995) .  About two -thirds of affecte d individuals are 30 years old or younger at the 
time of disease onset.   
 
The course of AA is unpredictable and while up to 50% of patients may recover within 1 year even 
without treatment, most patients will have more than one episode of hair loss  (Price 2008) .   Factors 
portending a poorer prognosis for regrowth are more extensive hair loss presentations (extensive 
AA, AT, AU), an ophiasis pattern of hair loss, a long duration of hair loss, a positive family history, 
the presence of other autoimmune disea ses, nail involvement, and young age of first onset  (Tosti 
2006, Weise 1996) .  In children, the disease may have a tendency towards worsening with time 
even if the initial presentation was mild , and the progressively disfiguring nature of the disease 
can b e psychologically devastating. AA is highly associated with numerous psychiatric 
comorbidities including adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders and depression in both children 
and adults, and an effective treatment for AT and AU, the more severe forms of the disease, 
represents a significant unmet medical need  (Bilgic 2014, Ruiz -Doblado 2003, Alkhalifah 2010) .  
 
The clinical development of innovative therapies in AA has lagged far behind other autoimmune 
conditions and there are currently no evidence -based  treatments for AA. A Cochrane database 
review highlighted that few therapies for AA have been comprehensively evaluated in randomized 
clinical trials and that no treatment has demonstrated significant benefit compared to placebo 
according to evidence -based assessment s (Delamere, 2008 ).  This lack of good evidence -based 
data remains a challenge for physicians attempting to select efficacious treatments for their patients 
and, as a result, numerous approaches to treatment exist and are typically based on con siderations 
such as the age of the patient, the extent and/or duration of the disease, patient expectations, cost 
considerations (both time and financial resources) and physician preferences and experience.  
 
Common treatments for the less severe (patchy) f orm of AA include corticosteroids, either 
topical ly applied or i njected intralesionally into the alopecic areas, or the induction of an allergic 
reaction at the site of hair loss using a topical contact sensitizing agent - an approach known as 
topical immun otherapy - typically with the topical contact sensitizers diphen ylcycloprophenone

 (DPCP), squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE), or treatment with topical anthralin.   While these 
same treatment options may be utilized for the more severe forms of AA, their use  in the more 
severe forms of AA is limited not only due to limited efficacy, but also because of the 
impracticality of using them over extensive body surface areas.  Additional treatments used for 
extensive forms of AA (AT, AU) have included systemic stero ids (pulsed or chronically 
administered), immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine or methotrexate, phototherapy 
with psoralen +UVA (PUVA), narrow -band UVB, photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy 
(e.g., excimer laser, fractional photothermolysis la sers), prostaglandin analogs, etanercept, 
bexarotene and others, all with varying degrees of success and each with its inherent risk of adverse 
effects and unproven efficacy  (Alkhalifah 2010, Price 1999, Hordinsky 2015, Strober 2005) .  Most 
recently, howev er, a breakthrough in the understanding of the path ophysiology of AA  and several 
case reports in the literature have suggested that a group of inhibitors of the JAK -STAT pathway, 
the Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors, or “jakinibs” may be efficacious in the treatment of AA even 
in its most severe phenotypes, AT and  AU (Jabbari, 2015, Pieri, 2015, Xing 2014) .  
 
The JAKs are members of a family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in cytokine receptor 
signaling.  The JAK family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, Tyk2) plays an essential role in 
regulating the signaling process of most cytokines in cells by linking the cytokine -induced 
signaling from the cell surface membrane receptors to signal transducers and activators of 
transcription, or STATs, within the cell s. Once these JAK receptors are activated by the binding 
of a cytokine to the appropriate receptor, they initiate a JAK -STAT signaling pathway which can 
modify gene expression and modulate important regulatory functions in the cell, including 
regulating im mune and inflammatory responses.  JAK1 and JAK3 are constitutively associated 
with the alpha chain and the common gamma chain (γc), respectively, of the receptors for 
interleukin -2 (IL2), interleukin -4 (IL -4), interleukin -7 (IL -7) interleukin -9 (IL -9), int erleukin -15 
(IL-15), and interleukin -21 (IL -21).  When these cytokines bind to their respective receptors, JAK1 
and JAK3 are activated and initiate a signaling cascade that drives key inflammatory events, 
including lymphocyte activation and proliferation. The JAK inhibitors can block the cytokine 
receptor signaling pathways, (in this instance JAK1 and JAK3) blocking JAK -STAT transcription 
activation, and can therefore modulate inflammatory or immune responses, which can be 
beneficial in a variety of disease  states, particularly, as recently reported, AA  (Xing 2014) .   In that 
report, pharmacologic inhibition of JAK kinase signaling (JAK -STAT signaling) was reported to 
promote hair growth in both genetic mouse models of alopecia and in human patient s. 
 
Immuno pathology & Pathophysiology of AA  
Alopecia areata (AA) results from an autoimmune attack on the hair follicles that results in 
growing anagen -phase terminal hairs being induced to prematurely enter the telo gen-phase and 
then shed.   In its most acute state,  AA demonstrates a histopathologically characteristic white cell 
infiltrate - the so called “swarm of bees” - encircling the human hair follicle , though more chronic 
forms typically demonstrate a sparse r infiltrate  (Jabbari 2016, Whiting 2003) . Though the ex act 
autoantigens expressed in the perifollicular epithelium that allow these specific T -cells to infiltrate 
the normally immunologically privileged hair follicle have been previously unknown, the T -cells 
that home to the hair follicle have been demonstrate d to consist of both CD4 and CD8 cells.  Most 
recent studies have further characterized a specific subpopulation of activated NKG2D -bearing 
CD8 + T-cells as being prominent in the peribulbar infiltrate, and it is now currently felt that these 
CD8+NKG2D+ effector T -cells preferentially localize to dermal sheath cells aberrantly expressing

 high levels of MHC molecules and NKG2D ligands.  Interferons, as key activators of the MHC 
locus and of the cellular immune response, appear to play a key role in elimina ting the 
immunologic privilege of the hair follicle and in inducing and maintaining the pathologic 
inflammatory response in AA.  This is also seen in the C3H -HeJ mouse model of AA, in which 
IFN-γ is required for pathogenesis, and in which administration of  IFN-γ accelerate s disease. 
(Gilhar 2005, Hirota 2003).  
 
AA has been viewed as a Th1 -driven disease and, consistent with a pathogenic cellular immune 
response, elevated  Th1 cytokines/ chemokines (IFN -induced chemokines [IP -10/CXCL10]) are 
seen in the perip heral blood of AA patients and IFN -inducible gene signatures have been described 
in the skin of AA patients and may correlate with disease activity  (Arca 2004, Barahmani 2009, 
Kuwano 2007) .  Additionally, transcriptional profiles in human AA patients have shown a Type I 
IFN response in lesional biopsies and Th1 skewing and elevated IFN response 
cytokines/chemokines in both the peripheral blood and in reviewed scalp bio psies (Jabbari 2015, 
Xing 2014, Jabbari 2016).   The cellular source of IFN -γ is hypothesiz ed to be the T -cells, as in the 
AA mouse model IFN -gamma producing CD8+NKG2D+ cells dominate the de rmal HF infiltrate , 
and in human AA, IFN -γ producing cells were identified in 4 of 5 dermal crawl -out assays  
(Christiano 2016) .  Additionally, data  implicate  IL- 15 in driving activation of IFN -producing CD8 
T-cells (Xing 2014) .  
 
Thus, preclinical and preliminary clinical information, as discussed above, strongly suggests that 
the primary pathophysiologic mechanism in AA (including AT and AU) is a cytokine me diated 
(primarily through T -lymphocyte induced upregulation of IL -15 and IFN gamma) induction of and 
prolonged maintenance of the telogen stage of the hair cycle.  Inhibitors of the JAK/STAT 
pathway, particularly JAK1 and JAK3, are known to downregulate th e effects of both IFN -gamma 
(through the inhibition at JAK1), and IL -15 (through inhibition at both JAK1 and JAK 3), and 
several published case reports have demonstrated the potential for compounds that are JAK1/3 
inhibitors to induce hair g rowth in patien ts with AA (Kim 2017, Craiglow 2014, Craiglow 2017, 
Gupta 2016, Scheinberg 2016) .  As ATI -50002  is a potent inhibitor at JAK 1 and JAK 3, it is 
strongly suggested that ATI -50002  may be effective in the treatment of AA , AU and AT . 
 
Among patients with AA, patients with higher disease burdens are unlikely to have satisfactory 
outcomes with current therapies. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. is developing ATI-50002 as a topical 
treatment for stable AA.  Aclaris is also developing ATI-50001  for the tre atment of AA, AU and 
AT.  ATI -50001 is a n oral  pro-drug that is rapidly converted pre -systemically to ATI -50002, a 
potent highly selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kinase 3 (JAK3).  In this 
study, we will be evaluating whether or not  the topically ap plied JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor, ATI -
50002 , will result in regrowth of scalp hair loss and if applicable, eyebrow hair loss due to  
underlying AU and AT . 
 
In a previous Phase 1 study  in healthy volunteers, single ascending oral doses of ATI-50001 of 50  
mg to 500 mg and multiple ascending doses of up to 400 mg BID were well -tolerated.  There were 
no SAEs.  All treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  were transient and mild in intensity 
with the exception of 4 TEAEs: facial bone fracture, headache  (2), and catheter site pain , which 
were classified as moderate.  The most frequently reported drug related TEAE s occurring in > 1% 
of subjects were abdominal pain (10%), flatulence (7%), diarrhea (6%) and headache (6%).  Three

 subjects showed mildly elevated ALT or  AST concentrations , which in two subjects were  
considered not clinically significant.  For the other subject, the mild ALT elevation was reported 
as a treatment emergent adverse event possibly related to the study drug.  No clinically significant 
laborato ry abnormalities were observed.  There were no clinically significant  findings from 12 -
lead ECGs or vital signs assessments.   
 
ATI-50001 was not detected in plasma and there was a dose -related increase in plasma of th e 
active metabolite ATI -50002. T he hal f-life of ATI -50002 , after 14 days of dosing , was 
approximately 9.0 hours.  Systemic levels of ATI -50002, following oral doses of ATI-50001 in 
healthy volunteers transiently reduced pSTAT5 activity in ex vi vo IL-2 stimulated lymphocytes, 
indicating inhibit ion of the JAK signaling pathway.  Upon multiple dosing, pSTAT5 activity 
showed a more sustained inhibition during the dosing period.    
 
Non-clinical studies conducted with oral administration of ATI -50001 and topic al administration 
of ATI -50002 support the topi cal administration of ATI -50002 ( ATI-50002 Topical Solution  
Investigator Brochure) .   
 
 STU DY RATIONALE  
4.1. Study Rationale  
Preclinical and preliminary clinical information, as discussed above, strongly suggests that the 
primary pathophysiologic mechani sm in AA (including AT and AU) is a cytokine -mediated 
(primarily through T -lymphocyte induced upregulation of IL -15 and IFN gamma) induction of and  
prolonged maintenance of the telogen stage of the hair cycle.   Inhibitors of the JAK/S TAT  
pathway , particula rly JAK1 and JAK3, are known to downregulate the effects of both IFN -gamma 
(through the inhibition at JAK1), and IL -15 (through inhibition at both JAK1 and JAK 3), and 
several published case reports have demonstrated the potential for compounds that are JA K1/3 
inhibitors to indu ce hair growth in patients with AA , AU and AT .  As ATI -50002  is a potent 
inhibitor at JAK 1 and JAK 3, it is s trongly suggested that ATI -50002  may be effective in the 
treatment of AA, AU and AT .   
 
The double -blind period of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerabili ty, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics  of ATI-50002 Topical  Solution, 0.46% compared to V ehicle Topical 
Solution  applied twice -daily for 28 days  in subjects with AU or AT .  On Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 
28 (Visit 6 ), study medication will only be applied once a day. The study will include the 
assessment of the scalp hair loss at Baseline (Visit 2) and Day 29  (Visit 7) by both SALT and 
ALODEX.  Early signs of hair regrowth are expected to take a minimum of 3 to 6 months in this 
population.  Measurable hair regrowth may take at least 6 months or longer.  Data from SALT 
and ALODEX will be described but no formal statistical comparisons will be made between Day 
1 (Visit 2) and Day  29 (Visit 7)  assessments.  
 
Subjects who complete the double -blind period without any clinically significant adverse events 
or tolerability issues as assessed by the Investigator  and who continue to meet the entry criteria  
will have the option to enroll in the open -label extension.  The open -label period will evaluate 
the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ATI -50002 Topical Solution, 0.46%  for the treatment of 
subjects with AU or AT . Subjects will apply ATI -50002 Topical Solution 0.46% to the entire

 scalp, twice daily for 12 months.  In addition, subjects with eyebrow loss may apply a thin film 
of study medication to the affected eyebrow(s) twice -daily for 12 months.    
 
The 12-month  open -label treatment period  is supported by the results of 26 -week mouse and 39 -
week dog oral toxicity studies with systemic administration and the 9 -month minipig study with 
dermal administration.  
 
ATI-50002 -AA-202 Study Update  
Eleven subject s have been treated with ATI -50002 Topical Solution .  According to d ata entered 
into the eCRF as of August 3, 2018, five subjects experienced 7 adverse events ; cold sore lesion, 
skin abrasion (scalp) , hypertensive urgency, lower leg swelling, worsening depr ession, elevated 
A1C and headache/ migraine .  All adverse event s were considered unrelated to study med ication 
and all were reported as mild severity except  for hypertensive urgency and worsening depression  
which were moderate in severity.    There were no serious treatment -related adverse events reported 
in the study.   One serious adverse event, worsening of depression , was reported in subject  01-005. 
The subject had a 48 -year history of depression and a  3-year history of bipolar disorder.  She was 
treated with electroconvulsive therapy and the event is o ngoing and assessed by the investigator 
as not related to study medication.  Levels of ATI -50002 in the blood were all below the limit of 
quantification  (1 ng/mL)  at all timepoints  on Day 28 .  Two subjects h ave discontinued from the 
study ; both subject s withdrew consent .   
 
Early hair growth  (reductions in SALT scores)  is evident in 3 subjects who are currently on active 
treatment.  In order to  continue to assess response to treatment given the favorable safety to date, 
this amendment will allow subjects to continue with twice -daily active study medication 
applications up to 12 months.

 study if the subject has been on a stable dose prior to study entry and, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, will not affect the safety or efficacy of  the subject during the study.  Topical hair/scalp 
products (shampoos, conditioners, other products) should be reviewed by the Investigator and are 
permitted if, in the Investigator’s opinion, they will not affect the safety, pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodyn amic assessments of the subject during the study.  
Topical therapies such as topical corticosteroids are permitted if they are not applied on or near 
the scalp . Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids are allowed in the study.  
 
Prior permitted concomitant me dications taken within 30 days of beginning treatment with study 
medication will be documented in the subject’s source document and eCRF.  In addition, any new 
permitted medications administered during protocol treatment and through Week 56 (Visit 16) will 
be documented in the subject’s source document and eCRF.   
 
6.5.2.  Prohibited and/ or Restricted Medications  
Any medication, shampoo or hair / scalp  product known to affect hair growth in AU or AT is 
prohibited throughout the study period.  Subjects who are on a stable dose of finasteride for benign 
prostatic hypertrophy for greater than 1 year, are eligible for enrollment into the study as long as 
they maintain the same stable dose throughout the study.  Since subjects with known AGA are 
excluded from the study, treatment with finasteride for alopecia during the study and within one 
year prior to study enrollment is prohibited.     
A list of medications and therapies that require a specific washout period prior to study entry and 
are not perm itted during the study is in Table 1.

6.6. Subject Identifier (SI)  
The investigator will assign a unique five -digit subject identifier (SI) to each subject at Screening 
(Visit 1).  
 
The SI format will be NN -NNN, using leading zeroes as appropriate, where:  
• The first 2 digits are the investigational center site number assigned by Aclaris  
• The final 3 digi ts are the subject number (SN), assigned in ascending numerical order by 
the investigator or designee, without omitting or repeating any number, starting with 001.  
For example, the SI for the twenty -third subject that signs an informed consent form at sit e number 
01 would be 01 -023. The subject will be identified using the SI in all study documentation for the 
duration of the study.  
6.7. Replacement Subjects  
Subject enrollment will continue until approximately 12 subjects have been randomized.  Subjects 
who are  randomized and do not complete the study will not be replaced.  
 
6.8. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any 
reason. The Investigator may remove a subject from the study if, in the Investigator's opinion, it is 
not in the best interest of the subject to continue the study. Examples of other reasons subjects may 
be discontinued from the study are: a change in compliance with a n inclusion or exclusion 
criterion, occurrence of AEs, occurrence of pregnancy or use of a prohibited therapy. The 
Investigator or designee must inform the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc . study monitor of any subject  
discontinuation .  (Refer to Section 10.2.4  for study medication discontinuation or termination 
criteria).  
 
In case of premature discontinuation of study participation, all efforts will be mad e to perform all 
Week 56 (Visit 16) assessments. The date the subject is withdrawn from the study and the reason 
for discontinuation must be recorded in the subject’s electronic case report forms (eCRFs). All 
withdrawn subjects with ongoing AEs will be followed until th e event has resolved or stabilized, 
until the subject is referred to the care of a local health care professional, or until a determination 
of a cause unrelated to the study medication  or study procedures is made.  
 
6.9. Study Termination  
This study may be termi nated prematurely in whole or in part due to a change in the benefit/risk 
profile for ATI -50002 Topical Solution such that continuation of the study would not be justified 
on medical , business,  or ethical grounds.  This determination may be made by the Stu dy 
Investigators in conjunction with the Sponsor, or by IRB or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA).  The Sponsor may also elect to terminate the study if enrollment is sufficiently slow to 
prevent the completion of the study in an acceptable timeframe, or if ATI-50002 development is 
discontinued.

FDA. The Invest igator must promptly notify all enrolled subjects and the IRB of study termination.  
 
 INVESTIGATIO NAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study  Design  
In the double -blind period, t his Phase 2, multi center, randomized study is designed to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, pharmac okinetics and pharmacodynamics of ATI -50002 Topical Solution 
in subjects with AU and AT.  Subjects will be required to have a clinical diagnosis of stable, 
clinically typical AU or  AT for a duration of at least six  months up to and including seven years.  
A total of 12 subjects will be randomized.   
 
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for eligibility into the study.  Subjects who 
meet all the entry criteria will be randomized 2:1 to ATI -50002 Topical Solution , 0.46%  or 
Vehicle Topical So lution and will apply  a minimum of  1.5 mLs up  to a maximum of  4 mLs of 
study medication to the entire scalp twice -a-day for 28 days. On Day 1 (Visit 2) , Day 28 (Visit 
6), and Day 196 (1 day prior to Visit 13), subjects will apply study medication once -a-day. 
 
Blood samples for concentrations of ATI -50002  will be collected  from  the first 6 subjects 
enrolled into the study  on Day 1 (Visit 2) , and Day 28 (Visit 6)  at pre -dose and 1, 2, 4, 8 hours 
post dose  and on Day 2 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 7), 24 hours post -dose.  Blood samples for 
immunology will be collected on Day 1 (Visit 2) before study medication application , and on 
Day 2 9 (Visit 7), 24 hours after study medication application  on Day 28 (Visit 6) .  A 4 -mm 
punch biopsy o f the scalp will be obtained to determine the concentration of ATI -50002 in the 
scalp skin on  Day 2 (Visit 3) 24 hours after study medication application on Day 1 ( Visit 2) and 
on Day 2 9 (Visit 7), 24 hours after study medication application on Day 28 ( Visit 6 ).  A 4 -mm 
punch biopsy will be obtained to determine histology and immunology prior to study medication 
application on Day 1 (Visit 2) .  Additional 4 -mm punch biopsie s to determine histology and 
immunology  will be collected  on Day 29 (Visit 7)  and Day 197 (Visit 13),  24 hours after study 
medication application on Day 28 (Visit 6) and Day 196 .  Safety and tolerability will be 
evaluated at each study visit by assessment of adverse events and vital signs, and at select visits, 
ECGs and clinical laboratory tests will be completed.  
 
On Day 29 (Visit 7) s ubjects who complete Visit 7 , continue to meet the entry criteria  and have 
no clinically significant AEs or tolerability issues  will be eligible to enter a 12-month  open -label 
extension.  In the open -label extension, safety, tolerability and efficacy will be assessed.  All 
subjects enrolled in the open -label extension will apply ATI -50002 Topical Solution, 0.46% to 
the entire scalp, twice daily for 52 weeks ( 12 months) .  In addition, subjects with eyebrow loss 
may apply a thin film of study medication to the affected eyebrow(s) twice -daily for 52 weeks 
(12 months ).  Subject s will be followed  for safety , tolerability  and efficacy as detailed in Section  
7.3.  Subjects who decline or are not eligible for the open -label extension should be seen for 
suture removal, if applicable per Section 7.3 and Visit 1 6 (Post -treatment) 30 days  ± 3 days  
following the Day 28 (Visit 6).   Subjects enrolled in the initial 6-month  Open Label Extension 
outlined by Protocol Amendment 1  (dated 06Feb2018) must be re -consented under Protocol

7.2. STUDY PROCEDURES  
The investigator or  a designated and appropriately trained staff member  should  perform the study 
assessments according to the schedule of assessments. The same staff member should perform 
the assessments for a given subject throughout the study. If this becomes impossible, an 
appropriate designee with overlapping experience with the  subject and study should perform the 
assessments. The same lighting conditions and subject positioning should be used for all 
evaluations for a given subject.

(Visit 6) .  Subjects that choose to continue in to open -label extension treatment will also have blood for immunology collected on Day 197 (Visit 13).  
14 On Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 28 (Visit 6) the study medication bottle should be weighed and then dispensed to the  subject for the initial application under the supervision of study staff in the 
office.  After the initial application on Day 1, the study medication bottle should be collected, weighed and dispensed to th e subject after the 24 -hour post -dose blood draw o n Day 2 (Visit 3).  For 
Visits 3 -6, each study medication bottle (with the cap) must be weighed before dispensing to the subject and at the time of return usi ng the scale provided by Aclaris.  On Day 28 (Visit 6), the 
study medication bottle should be wei ghed after subject applies the study medication in the office and not redispensed.  
15 The investigator or designee will remove the sutures approximately 14 days after scalp biopsy, unless an absorbable suture is  used.  
16 On Day 27  or the day prior to Day  28 (Visit 6) , the study staff will call the subject to remind them not to apply study medication on the morning of Day 28 (Visit 6) and to brin g both used and 
unused study medication bottles to the visit.  Study medication will be applied in the office un der the supervision of the study staff.  On Day 196 or the day prior to Week 28 (Visit 13) the study 
staff will call the subject to remind them not to apply study medication in that evening and on the morning of Week 28 (Visit  13), and to bring both used a nd unused study medication bottles to the 
visit.  The scalp biopsy at Week 38 (Visit 13) should be performed 24 hours (±30 minutes) post the last study medication appl ication.  
17On Day 29 (Visit 7) subject may be given the option to move into open -label e xtension treatment.   
• If the subject declines the open -label extension, she/he should be seen for the Visit 1 6 (Post -treatment) assessments 30 days following the date of Day 2 9 (Visit 7). 
• If the subject chooses to continue in to the open -label extension, she/he must sign an ICF prior to being dispensed open -label drug and receiving continued study medication application 
instructions.  
• If the subject enrolls in open -label treatment after Day 29 (Visit 7), an unscheduled visit will be conducted in order to obtain consent, review drug applic ation instructions, and dispense 
drug.  This will be considered the official date that the subject i nitiated open -label extension treatment and the scheduling of subsequent visits 8 -16 should be based off of this date  as 
referenced by (OLE xxx) in the treatment day schedule header above.  
 
18Subjects who are eligible and consent to enter the open -label extension will have a baseline CEA and SEA completed at Visit 7 or the unscheduled Visit.

7.4. Subject N ourishment  
The site should provide meals, snacks and beverages to the subject during the Day 1  (Visit 2)  and 
Day 28  (Visit 6) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sampling times.   
 
7.5. Duration of the Study  
The an ticipate d time for study enrollment is 3 to 6 months.  The duration of the screening period 
is up to 30 days. The expected double -blind treatment period for each subject  is 29 days (maximum 
of 28 days of study medication application) .  The post -treatment follow -up period is up to 33 days 
(30 + 3-day window).  The maximum total study duration for the double -blind period from the 
subject’s first visit (Visit 1) through the subject’s last visit (Visit 8) is 92 days.  On Day 1  (Visit 2)  
and Day 28  (Visit 6), subjects are required to be confined at the investigational center until all 
study procedures are completed.  The confinement p eriod may last approximately  10 hours.  The 
duration of the total study participation from Baseline (Visit 2) to the open -label post-treatment 
follow up visit, Week 56 (Visit 1 6) is anticipated to be a maximum of 400 days. The duration of 
the open -label extension  (OLE)  should be based on the date of the visit that the subject initiated 
OLE treatment rather than the days from Baseline (Visit 2) .  For s ubjects who entered the open -
label extension and had a gap  between Visit 7 and entry into the open -label extension due to an 
administrative delay total study participation may be longer than 400 days.

8.2. Subject Randomization  
Prior to the start of the study, Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or a designated third party will generate a 
list of randomization numbers that shall be transmitted to the assigned clinical packaging 
organization for study medication labeling.  The randomization list will be stored with access 
limited to designated personnel  for study medication labeling.  The randomization list will be made 
available , as appropriate , to unblind the database.   
 
For the double -blind period, s ubjects will be assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups  in a random 
manner and at a 2 :1 ratio. A t Baseline ( Visit 2 ), an investigational center staff member will assign 
study medication to eligible subjects by selecting an appropriate Subject Kit.  The staff member 
must select Subject Kits in chronological sequence and in an ascending numerical order s tarting 
with the lowest available Subject Kit number.  No Subject Kit number may be omitted or reused.  
The Subject Kit number is the randomization number.   
 
The investigational staff member randomizing the subject will enter the subject identifier , subject 
initials , and date randomized on both parts of the Subject Kit label, remove the tear -off part, attach 
it to the subject’s study medication  label page and record the Subject Kit number in the subject’s 
eCRF.  
 
The 52-week  (12 month)  extension is open -label, all eligible subjects will receive ATI -50002 
Topical Solution, 0.46%.  
 
8.3. Application of Study Medication  
At Visit 2 (Day 1), the investigational center staff member will instruct each subject  to apply a 
minimum of 1.5 mL up to a maximum of 4-mL dose of ATI -50002 Topical Solution , 0.46%  or 
Vehicle Topical Solution , twice -daily  to the entire scalp ; once in the morning and approximately 
12 hours later following the instructions in APPENDIX 1 .  On Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 28 (Visit 
6), study medic ation will be applied once -a-day due to the 24 -hour PK and PD assessments . The 
subject must wash his /her hands thoroughly before and after each study medication  applic ation.  
The predose PK sample should be drawn and the baseline PD scalp biopsy should be obtained 
prior to study medication application.  The subject should apply a thin film of the assigned study 
medication to his/her entire scalp and gently rub in the st udy medication.   
 
On Day 1 / Baseline  (Visit 2 ) the investigational staff member will:  
• Dispense the appropriate study medication bottle.  
• Weigh the bottle with the cap prior to the first study medication application  and record in 
the subject’s source docume nt. 
• Instruct the subject on the appropriate application technique  (APPENDIX 1 ).

Date: 14AUG 2018 , Version 3.0                          Page 39 of 68 
 • Instruct the subject not to apply study medication to the biopsy site  and to avoid contact 
with the eyes . 
• Observe the subject’s first study medication application to ensure proper coverage and 
monitor the subject for at least 20 minutes.  Collect the study medication bottle.  
• Record the first application completion time . 
• Weig h the bottle  with the cap  after study medication application  and record the weight in 
the subject’s source document . 
• Redispense stu dy medication after the 24 -hour PK and PD blood an d biopsy sample 
collections  on Day 2 (Visit 3) . 
 
On Day 28  (Visit 6) the in vestigational staff member will:  
• Collect and weigh all study medication  bottles  (with the cap on the bottle)  returned from 
the subject  and record weight(s) in the subject’s source document .  
• Select  one study medication bottle for the Day 28  (Visit 6)  appli cation.  
• Weigh the bottle  and cap  prior to study medication  application  and record weight in the 
subject’s source document . 
• Review the application  instructions with the subject  (APPENDIX 1 ).   
• Instruct the subject to avoid contact with the eyes.  
• Observe the subject’s study medication application to ensure proper coverage.   Collect the 
study medication bottle  after application . 
• Record the study medication  application completion time  in the subject’s source document . 
• Weigh the bottle and cap  after study medication application.  
• Do not return the study medication  bottle  to the subject . 
8.4. Study Medication  Weights  
On Day 1 (Visit  2) and Day 28 (Visit 6), a study staff member will weigh the study medication  
bottles with the cap prior to and after study medication  applications.  At the other study visits (Visit 
3-15), the staff will weigh the bottles with the cap prior to dispensing new bottle(s) to the subject 
and after collec tion of used bottles from the subject.  The weights of the study medication bottles 
must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation.  Bottles that are not dispensed to the 
subject do not need to be weighed.  
 
8.5. Treatment Compliance  
The investigator or designee will be responsible for mo nitoring subject compliance by reviewing 
the amount of study medication used based on the weight of the used study medication bottles and 
by querying the subject on usage at each vi sit.  At Visits 4-15, an investigationa l center staff 
member must query each subject to determine compliance with the study medication application 
procedure and frequency.  The staff member will document the study medication usage in the 
source document and eCRF.  Study staff will counsel the s ubjects, as required to make sure subjects 
are compliant with study medication  applications . 
 
8.6. Dose Modification  
Subjects should be instructed not to modify the study medication  application procedure or 
frequency.  All application modifications must be repo rted on the appropriate source document 
Protocol: ATI -50002 -AA-202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
  
                                                                           CONFIDENTIAL                                           
Date: 14AUG 2018 , Version 3.0                          Page 40 of 68 
 and eCRF.  If the subject experiences any significant application site AE(s) , after discussion with 
the Sponsor, the investigator or designee may direct the subject to reduce study medication  
application frequency  to once a day .   Every effort should be made to resume twice daily 
applications for the week prior to Day 28 (Visit 6).  If a subject cannot resume twice -daily 
applications to the scalp for more than 4 consecutive days, the subject must be removed from the 
study.  Refer to  Section 10.2.4  for Study Medication Interruption or Discontinuation due to related 
SAEs or specific abnormal laboratory values.  
 
8.7. Study Medication  Accountability  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for ensuring accountabili ty for the investigational study 
medication , including reconciliation of study medication s and maintenance of study medication  
records.  Upon receipt of study medication , the clinical site will check for accurate delivery and 
ackno wledge receipt by signing (or initialing) and dating the documentation provided.  One copy 
of this document will be returned to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee) and one copy will be 
maintained in the study file. In addition, an accurate study medic ation disposition record will be 
kept up to date , specifying the amount dispensed for each subject and the date of dispensing. This 
inventory record will be available for inspection at any time. The original inventory record will be 
available for review by  Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. upon request.   At the completion of the study, 
all used and unused study medication  bottles will be returned to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc . (or 
designee) for disposal per Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc . (or designee) written instructi ons.  
Alternatively, drug disposal may be completed by the investigative site (following appro priate 
monitor review of inventory) if the  site has a written procedure in place dealing with  
destruction/disposal of investigational products.   
8.8. Other Study Supplies  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  or a third party will provide : 
• Equipment, supplies and training for taking standardized photographs  
• Equipment and training for SALT and ALODEX assessments  
• Equipment,  supplies and training for capture of ECGs for central reading  
• Scales for weighing the study medication bottles  
• Supplies and shipment instructions of PK  and PD  samples  
• UPT kits  
  
8.9. Blinding  
Blinding of study medication is important for validity of this study .  This study uses a double -blind 
design  for the initial 28 -day double -blind treatment period .  The study medications  used during the 
double -blind period  are indistinguishable in appearance, as packaged and labeled.  
 
8.9.1.  Unblinding the Study Medication  (Double -blind Period)  
The blinding may be broken in the event of a medical emergency, in which knowledge of the study 
medication identity is critical to the management of the subject’s course of treatment.  Before 
breaking the blind, the investigator shal l determine that the information is necessary ( i.e., that is, 
will alter the subject’s immediate course of treatment).  In many cases, particularly when the 
Protocol: ATI -50002 -AA-202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
  
                                                                           CONFIDENTIAL

 emergency is clearly not study medication -related, the problem may be effectively managed by 
assumi ng that the subject is receiving an active study medication without the need for unblinding.   
 
If the investigator deems it necessary to break the blind for a study subject, he/she will attempt to 
contact the Medical Monitor (protocol page 1) to obtain co ncurrence.  If it is not possible to contact 
the Medical Monitor beforehand, contact her/him as soon as possible after breaking the blind for 
a subject.   
 
To identify a subject’s study medication, locate the second panel of the tear -off label from the 
Subject Kit attached to the subject’s study medication label page , and follow the instructions on 
the label.  Record the date of unblinding, the reason for unblinding, and the initials of the 
investigational staff member who performed the unblinding on the su bject’s study medication  label 
page.  Any subject whose blind has been broken must be discharged from the study (Section 6.8).  
Subject must complete the double -blind treatment period to be eligible for entry into the open -
label extension.   
 
At the end of the study, the original study medication  label page will be returned to Aclaris 
Therapeutics, Inc. with a photocopy placed in the investigator’s study file.  The o riginal study 
medication label page  will be available, upon request, to the site if needed to respond to a 
regulatory audit.  
8.10. Study Medication Packaging, Labeling, Storage and Security  
The study medication must be used by the study subjects only.  Investigational site staff will 
explain the application of the study medication to subjects.   
 
Study medication will be provided by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and labeled according to 
regulati ons.  Study medications must be stored in a secure area with limited access under 
appropriately controlled and monitored storage conditions.  Study medication should be stored at 
controlled room temperature 59°F - 77°F ( 15°C – 25°C).  Subjects will be inst ructed to store the 
study medication in the original glass bottle (in the carton provided) at room temperature, away 
from heat, moisture, direct light, and to keep it from freezing and out of the reach of children.  
 
The study medication will be supplied in  amber glass 120 mL bottles.  Disposable droppers with 
1 mL calibration mark will be provided in the study kits.   During the open -label portion of the 
study, applicators will also be provided for application of the ATI -50002 Topical Solution, 0.46% 
to the eyebrow(s).    
  
For the double -blind period, o ne Subject Kit box will contain 6 bottles in individual boxes and 
disposable droppers.  Each kit will be labelled with a two-part, three panel, double blind label.  
One part (one -panel) of the label remains attached to the Subject Kit, the other part (two -panel 
tear-off) is separated and attached to the subject’s study medication label page when the subject is 
randomized.  Each box and bottle will be labeled with a single panel label.   
 
For the open -label period, subjects will receive 1-3 bottles of ATI -50002 Topical Solution, 0.46% 
per month.  Each bottle is packaged in a carton and both the bottle and carton  will be  labelled with 
a single -panel label.

 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The study assessments will be performed according to the schedules noted below by the 
investigator, an appropriately trained study staff member or the subject as noted for each 
assessment.  The SALT and ALODEX ass essments should be performed by the same staff member 
for a given subject throughout the study.  If this is not possible, an appropriate designee with 
overlapping experience with the subject and study should perform the assessments.  Hair regrowth 
in subje cts is not anticipated during the 28 -day duration of the double -blind study medication 
application.  
9.1. Efficacy Assessments  
9.1.1.  Severity Alopecia Tool (SALT)  Score  
The SALT score  is a measurement of the amount of scalp without any hair.  The Investigator will 
assess the SALT score using an iPAD provided by Aclaris at Baseline  (Visit 2) , Day 2 9 (Visit 7 ), 
and as detailed in Section  7.3 for the subjects who continue in the open -label extension . Equipment, 
supplies, training and a detailed Reference Guide will be provided to the investigational site prior 
to the initiation of subject enrollment.  
 
9.1.2.  Alopecia Density and Extent Score (ALODEX)  
The ALODEX score is a measurement of the amount of scalp wi th hair loss  (Olsen, submitted) .  
The Investigator will calculate the ALODEX score using the iPAD provided by Aclaris at Baseline  
(Visit 2) , Day 29 ( Visit 7) and as detailed in Section  7.3 for subjects who continue in the open -
label extension .  Equipment, supplies, training and a detailed Reference Guide will be provided to 
the investigational site prior to the initiation of subject enrollment.  
 
9.2. Pharmacodynamic ( Biom arker ) Assessment   
9.2.1.  Scalp  Biopsy  (PD)  
A 4-mm punch biopsy of the scalp  will be obtained on Baseline  (Visit 2)  just prior to the first 
applicatio n of study medication  and at Day 2 9 (Visit 7) 24 hours  (± 30  minutes)  after the study 
medicatio n application for histology  and RNA sequencing  (APPENDIX 5 ). At Visit 13, a 4 -mm 
biopsy will be obtained approximately 24 hours  ± 30 minutes  after the morning  dose on the day

 9.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
9.3.1.  Scalp Biopsy ( PK) 
A 4-mm punch biopsy of the scalp will be ob tained on Day 2 (Visit 3) and on  Day 2 9 (Visit 7) 24 
hours (± 30 minutes) after the study medication application  (on Day 1/Visit 2 and Day 28/Visit 6)  
to determine the concentration of ATI -50002 in the skin (APPENDIX 5 ).  The scalp biopsy 
should be obtained after the area of the scalp to be biopsied is tape stripped using 5 D -Squame 
circular discs.  
  
The bioanalytical lab will provide instructions on the collection and shipment of samples for 
analysis.  
9.3.2.  Blood Samples  (Double -blind Period)   
For the first six subjects  enrolled into the study , blood samples for PK analysis of ATI -50002 will 
be collected by a qualified staff  member.  On Baseline/ Day 1  (Visit 2 ) and Day 2 8 (Visit 6) blood  
samples will be collected at predose ( 0-hour) (just prior to study medication application in the 
morning) and then at the following times after study medication application : 
• 1 hour (± 5 minut es) 
• 2 hours (± 10 minutes)  
• 4 hours (± 10 minutes)  
• 8 hours (± 10 minutes)  
On Day 2 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 7)  
• 24 hours (± 30 minutes)  
The bioanalytical laboratory will provide instructions on the collection and shipment of samples.  
 
9.4. Eyebrow  Assessments (Open -Label Extension)  
Subjects with eyebrow loss in one or both eyebrows will be allowed to treat their affected 
eyebrow(s) during the open -label period of the study.  Both the investigator and subject will assess 
eyebrow  loss at entry into t he open -label extension and then monthly  for the first 6 months, then 
at 9 and 12 months  during the open -label treatment period.   The Investigator will document the 
affected areas of the eyebrow or brow(s) on the source document and eCRF .  
 
9.4.1.  Clinician’s Eye brow Assessment (CEA ) (Open -Label Period)  
The CEA is the Investigator’s assessment of the affected eyebrow (s) at a particular point in time. 
The Investigator should NOT refer to any other assessments to assist with these assessments.  
 
At Visits 8 - 16, the Investigator will assess the affected eyebrow (s) using the scale below and report 
the one integer that best describes the amount of eyebrow hair present .  If both eyebrows a re 
affected, each eyebrow will be assessed separately.

2 Some eyebrow hair:  Numerous terminal hairs are visible  in the affected area(s)  
3 Most eyebrow hair : Mostly complete eyebrow regrowth with terminal hair  in the 
affected area(s)  
4 Full eyebrow hair:  Complete eyebrow regrowth with t erminal hair  in the affected 
area (s)  
 
 
9.4.2.  Subject’s Eyebrow Assessment (SEA ) (Open -Label Period):  
The SEA is the subject’s assessment of the appearance of eyebrow hair present on  the affected  
eyebrow (s) at a particular point in time. The subject should NOT refer to any other assessments to 
assist with these assessments.  
 
At Visits 8-16, the subject will assess the affected eyebrow (s) using the scale below and report the 
one integer that best describes the amount of eyebrow hair present .  If both eyebrows a re affected, 
each eyebrow will be assessed separately.  
 
Subject’s E yebrow Assessment  
Grade  Descriptor  
0 No eyebrow hair :  No thick, coarse hairs are visible  in the affected  area(s) 
1 A little eyebrow hair:  A few thick, coarse hairs are visible in the affected area(s)  
2 Some eyebrow hair:  Numerous thick, coarse hairs are visible in the affected area(s)  
3 Most eyebrow hair:  The majority of the affected area (s) of the eyebrow is covered 
in thick, coarse hairs  
4 Full eyebrow hair:   The affected area (s) of the eyebrow is fully covered in thi ck, 
coarse hairs  
 
 
An investigational staff member will identify the eyebrow to be evaluated by the subject, educate the 
subject on the SEA scale before each evaluation and direct the subject to assess the eyebrow , one 
eyebrow at a time . The staff member  should not influence the subject’s assessment.  
 
The study staff member will report the SEA grade the subject indicates in the source document for 
the affected eyebrow (s). Both the subject and the study staff member must sign/initial the source 
document to  indicate the subject performed the SEA as instructed.  
 
9.5. Assessment of Safety  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study by the investigator or  a designated and approp riately 
trained staff  member .

 9.5.1.  Vital signs  
Vital signs will be measured at each visit during the study . The following items will be measured : 
• Body temperature  
• Pulse rate  
• Respiration rate  
• Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes  
• Height  and Weight (at Visit 2  only) . 
 
Any measure that is, in the opinion of the investigator, abnormal AND clinically significant  (CS) 
must be recorded as medical history if found prior to the first study medication application , or as 
an AE if found after the first study medication treatment  begins.  
 
A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg is considered 
abnormal and  therefore must be defined as CS  or not clinically significant (NCS) on the eCRF.   A 
weight >300 lbs. is considered abnormal and therefore must  be defined as C S or NC S on the eCRF.  
 
9.5.2.  Physical Examination  
The investigator or designee will perform a physical examination for all body systems  (general 
appearance, examination of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, respiratory, cardiovascular, 
abdominal , extremities, neurological, musculoskeletal, lymphatic and skin assessment)  at 
Screening (Visit 1) and Day 2 9 (Visit 7). For subjects who are enrolled in the Open -label extension, 
a physical examination will also be performed at Week 56 (Visit 1 6). 
 
9.5.3.  Clinical L aboratory Assessments  
A qualified staff member will collect n on-fasting samples for clinica l laboratory analysis at the  
times in the  visit schedule in Section 7.3 . Samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis.  
Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for handling and shipping instructions.

The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reported on the central laboratory’s standard 
reports. The investigator must not e NCS or CS to define the clinical relevance  of any result that is 
outside the normal range for the laboratory . The investigator must date and initial every laboratory 
report.  
 
The investigator or subinvestigator must review all the Screening ( Visit 1 ) laboratory test results 
against the study entry criteria for each subject prior to Baseline ( Visit 2). The investigator must 
report all laboratory results that are BOTH outside the normal range for the laboratory AND, in 
the opinion of the investigator , CS as medical  history if found prior to the first study medication 
treatment  or as an AE if found after the first study medication treatment  begins . The investigator 
must review all laboratory reports in a timely manner . 
9.5.4.  Pregnancy tests  
Subjects who are WOCBP must have  a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening  (Visit 1)  
to continue in the study , a negative UPT  at Baseline  (Visit 2)  prior to  randomiz ation  and prior 
to study medication  application  at Day 28 (Visit 6). WOCBP who are enrolled in the open label 
period will have UPT at the visits detailed in Section 7.3 during the treatment period.  The UPT  
kits provided by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. have a minimum sensitivity of 25 -mIU ß -
HCG/ milliliter ( mL) of urine.  If the result of any post -treatment  UPT  is positive, the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and the subject’s pregnancy documented and fol lowed.  
 
9.5.5.  ECGs  
Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed by a qualified staff member  at Screening  (Visit 1) , 
Baseline  (Visit 2) , Day 15 (Visit 5) , Day 2 9 (Visit 7) and the visits outlined in Section 7.3 .  The 
ECGs must be obtained usin g a standard 12 -lead ECG with a 10mm/mV amplitude, at 25mm/sec 
and a 5 -10-second duration. To ensure a steady heart rate the subject must rest quietly in the supine 
position for at least 5 minutes prior to performing the ECG.  
 
A central lab, eResearchTech nology, Inc. (ERT), will provide equipment, supplies and site 
training.  In addition, ERT will process ECGs received by the sites and report results via a secure 
study portal. The ECG results will be interpreted by a qualified health professional (evaluato r) and

 the interpretation reported either directly on the tracing or in a separate report.   The evaluator will 
interpret the results of every ECG and define th e ECG as “normal ” or “abnormal ”.  Variations 
such as minor ST changes ( i.e., <0.5mm depression) and early re -polarization are considered 
normal.  
 
The investigator must review the evaluator’s interpretation of each subject’s screening  ECG prior 
to Baseline ( Visit 2 ). The investigator will review the evaluator’s interpretation of all ECG reports 
in a timely manner and comment on the clinical relevance of any result that is defined by the 
evaluator as abnormal.  
 
Any abnormalities that are, in the opinion of the investigator , clinically significant , must be 
reported as medical history if found prior to the start of the first study medication application or as 
an AE if found after the start of the first study medication application (see Section 10.1.1 ). 
 
9.6. Other Assessments  
9.6.1.  Demographics, Medical History and Alopecia Areata History  
During the S creening visit, the investigator or designee will interview each subject to obtain 
demographic information including date of birth, sex at birth, Fitzpatrick Skin Type, race and, if 
appropriate, ethnicity. The investigator or designee will interview each s ubject to obtain medical 
history information related to all medical conditions, surgeries and disease states th at, at S creening  
(Visit 1) : are ongoing, require concomitant therapy or are, in the opinion of the investigator, 
relevant to the subject’s study participation.  In addition, the medical history of women who are 
not of childbearing potential should reflect the reason e.g. post -menopausal for 1 year or greater, 
bilateral tubal ligation, or hysterectomy.  The investigator or designee will also obt ain an extensive 
AA history at S creening  (Visit 1)  (APPENDIX 3 ). 
 
9.6.2.  Photographic Assessment  
A qualified investigational staff member will take standardized photographs of  the scalp  at 
Baseline (Visit 2) , prior to study medication application , Visit 7 (Day 2 9) prior to the scalp biopsy  
and if enrolled in the open -label extension at the visits detailed in  Section  7.3.  The photographs 
are to document the baseline hair loss and any early signs of hair growth during treatment.  
Equipment, supplies, training and detailed instructi ons for obtaining and managing photographs 
will be provided to the investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment.  
 
 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study and reported on the appropriate Aclaris 
Therapeut ics, Inc.  AE eCRF.   
 
10.1. Definitions  
10.1.1.  Adverse E vents (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation subject 
administered a study medication (s) and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
Protocol: ATI -50002 -AA-202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
  
                                                                           CONFIDENTIAL                                           
Date: 14AUG 2018 , Version 3.0                          Page 48 of 68 
 the study medication .  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign or symptom 
associated with the use of a study medication  (including an abnormal laboratory finding), whether 
or not related to the study medication .  
 
Thus , any new , clinically signifi cant worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease, should be 
considered an AE.  
 
Every new episode  or clinically significant  worsening of a chronic condition ( e.g., headaches, 
seasonal allergies, depression , or hypertension ) should be reported as a separate AE, even if the 
condition is reported in the subject’s medical history.  
 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinically significant  abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwi se, signs , 
symptoms  or abnormal l aboratory values may be used to describe the AE.  
 
Any CS abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication  treatment  should be reported as 
medical history, not as an AE.  
 
10.1.2.  Serious Adverse E vent (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event  
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the hospital on 
an in -patient basis , even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospitalization is defined as an 
additional night stay in the ho spital. Hospitalization for a diagnostic test (even if related to an AE) 
or elective hospitalization that was planned before study enrollment (signing the ICF) are not 
themselves reasons for an event to be defined as a SAE.  
 
Important medical events are th ose that may not be immediately life threatening , result in death  or 
hospitalization , but are clearly of major clinical significance  and may  jeopardize the subject or 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These 
should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization.

 10.1.3.  Unexpected Adverse E vent 
An AE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 
10.1.4.  Adverse Event Reporting P eriod  
The investigator must start reporting n on-serious AEs with the subject’s  first study medication  
application and continue reporting until the end of the subject’s last study visit . Reporting for SAEs 
must start when the subject signs the ICF and continue until the end of the subject’s last visit.  
 
10.1.5.  Severity  
The investigator is to define the severity  of each AE using the following definitions  as a guideline . 
The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the 
severity that  is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
 
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated . 
Moderate  – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity . 
Severe  – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity.  
10.1.6.  Relationship to Study M edication  
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication  and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider 
all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject’s relevant medical 
history, concomitant therapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the relationship of the AE 
to the study medication . The investigator will define the relationship of an AE  to the study 
medication  by selecting one of the following categories:  
 
Related  – There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication  and the 
AE. 
 
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication  
and the AE.  
 
The expression “ reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship ( International Conference on 
Harmonization [ICH] E2A). 
 
10.2. Reporting Procedures  
10.2.1.  Procedures  for Reporting Adverse E vents  
At each post-enrollment  visit, the investigator will question the subject to elicit AEs using a  non-
directive  question such as “Has there been any c hange in your health since the previous study 
visit? ”  If appropriate , based on the subject’s response  to non -directed questioning to elicit AEs, 
the investigator will follow -up with directed question s and appropriate evaluations .  
Protocol: ATI -50002 -AA-202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
  
                                                                           CONFIDENTIAL

Any A E noted during the reporting period  must  be reported in the source document s and on the 
appropriate AE eCRF . AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medication s will be 
followed until they are resolved or until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as 
“Related” to the study medication s will be followed until they are  resolved or, i f not resolved after 
the subject’s last study visit, until i n the opinion of the investigator , the AE reaches a clinically 
stable outcome with or without sequela e. 
 
10.2.2.  Procedure for Reporting a Serious Adverse E vent 
Upon becoming aware of a  SAE  occurring during the AE reporting p eriod, whether or not related 
to the study medication s, the investigator must : 
 
1. Take the appropriate medical action  to ensure the subject’s safety . 
Immediately (within 24 hours) inform the Medical  Monitor  of the SAE by telephone:  
Terrence Chew, MD, RAC  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

Office Telephone: 858-922-6307    
SAE facsimile 484 -324-2359  
E-mail: tgchew@icloud.com  
2. Within 24 -hours complete,  as fully as possible, an AE eCRF  and an SAE form; fax or e-mail 
the form s and any other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication eCRF , medical 
history eCRF , laboratory tes t results) to the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  Medical Monitor . 
3. Monitor and document  the progress of the SAE  until it resolves or , if not resolved after the 
subject’s last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the AE reaches a clinically 
stable outcome with or without sequela e AND the investigator and Aclaris Thera peutics, Inc.   
Medical Monitor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved.  
4. Inform the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  Medical Monitor of SAE updates by telephone  
followe d by an SAE form update sent by e-mail. 
5. Comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements  and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Ethics Committee ( EC). 
 
10.2.3.  Safety Monitoring ECG Discontinuation Criteria  
Any subject who develops any of the follow ing ECG criteria during the active treatment phase will 
be instructed to stop study medication and will be withdrawn from the study:  
• A post -study medication ECG result where the evaluator’s interpretation shows any of the 
following:  
➢ Clinically significant rhythm disturbance other than sinus rhythm or ectopic 
supraventricular rhythm (ectopic atrial rhythm)  
Protocol: ATI -50002 -AA-202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

Date: 14AUG 2018 , Version 3.0                          Page 51 of 68 
 ➢ Clinically significant conduction disturbance including PR >240msec, pre -
excitation (delta wave and PR <120msec), second degree or higher AV block   
➢ New finding of QRS>120ms  (if not present at screen. For example, subject s with 
Right Bundle Branch Block at screening would not need to be withdrawn from the 
study if their subsequent ECGs remained unchanged).  
➢ Evidence of QT -interval prolongation, defined as a n increase in the QT cF interval  
>60ms from Visit 1  
➢ New QTcF > 500 ms  
➢ Acute signs of ischemia or infarction  
➢ Any ECG abnormality which may, in the opinion of the investigator, represent a 
new medical issue of concern  
 
10.2.4.  Study Medication Interruption and Discontinuation  
10.2.4.1  Study Medication Interruption  
Treatment with ATI -50002 Topical Solution should be temporarily interrupted in the event of 
severe adverse events considered related to ATI -50002, or in the event of one or more of the 
abnormal laboratory value s in Table 2. 
 
Table 2:  Study Medication Interruption Criteria  
Laboratory Test  Hold Study Medication if:  Resume Study Medication if:  
WBC count  < 2 x 109/L ≥ 2.5 x 109/L 
ANC  < 1 x 109/L ≥ 1.5 x 109/L 
Lymphocyte count  < 0.5 x 109/L ≥ 0.75 x 109/L  
Platelet count  < 75 x 109/L ≥ 100 x 109/L 
Hemoglobin  < 8 g/ dL or decrease > 2 g/dL  ≥ 10 g/dL  
AST or ALT  > 3 x ULN  < 2 x ULN or within 20% of baseline  values  
Serum creatinine  >2 x ULN  <1.5 x ULN or within 10% of baseline  value  
 
If a subject has one or more of the abnormal laboratory values noted in  Table 2, the investigator 
or designee upon receipt and review of the central laboratory report should instruct the subject to 
interrupt  study medication applications. The investigator or designee sho uld ask the subject 
about symptoms, concomitant illnesses and medications and repeat the test(s) as soon as 
possible.  The Medical Monitor must be notified of dose interruptions due to SAEs considered 
related to study medication or laboratory abnormalities  noted in  Table 2. 
  
If the retest confirms the abnormal laboratory value, then the study medication interruption should 
continue , followed by repeat t esting once a week or sooner at the discretion of the investigator.  
The subject should be followed until the laboratory abnormality(s) return to normal or to baseline 
values.   Study medication can be resumed after the abnormal lab value returns to normal or 
baseline , if in the opinion of the Investigator, it is in the best interest of the subject to continue .

 PREGNANCY  
11.1. Definition of Women of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP)  
WOCBP includes any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone 
successful surgical sterilization ( e.g., hysterectomy,  bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral 
oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as ≥12 months with no 
menses without an alternative medical cause.  WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test 
at Screening  (Visit 1)  and a negat ive UPT at Baseline  (Visit 2)  prior to randomization.  
11.2. Highly Effective Methods of Birth Control  
The Investigator or subinvestigator will discuss the potential risk factors associated with pregnancy 
and the importance of maintaining a highly effective metho d of contraception throughout the study 
with all WOCBP ( for example, those which result in a low failure rate - i.e., less than 1% per year - 
when used consistently and correctly) .  All WOCBP must use a highly effective method  of birth 
control during the st udy and for 30 days after the final application of study medication  in a manner 
such that risk of failure is minimized.   
 
Highly effective methods include : 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of  ovulation: 
Protocol: ATI -50002 -AA-202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
  
                                                                           CONFIDENTIAL

 o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
o oral 
o injectable  
o implantable  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Obstruction of fallopian tubes via medical device (Essure™)  
• intrauterine hormon e-releasing system (IUS)  
• vasectomized partner1 
• sexual abstinence2 
1Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner 
of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical 
success.  
2 Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if define d as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments  (study duration and 30 days after 
the last study medication application) . The reliabil ity of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
 
WOCBP must be on a highly effective method of birth control for the following timeframes prior 
to study entry:  
• Implants (on a stable dose for ≥90 days)  
• Injectables (on a stable dose for ≥90 days)  
• Patches (on a stable dose for ≥90 days)  
• Combined oral contraceptives (on a sta ble dose for ≥90 days)  
• Intrauterine devices (inserted for ≥30 days)  
 
Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
trial participation and of the potential risk factors associated with pregnancy while in st udy.  The 
subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  During the trial, all 
WOCBP will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be 
pregnant ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
If a s ubject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study medication 
administration, the study medication must be withheld until the results of a pregnancy test are 
available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive s tudy medication and must be 
discharged from the study.  
 
If, following study medication administration, it is determined that the subject may have been or 
was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including at least 2 days after study 
medicati on administration) the investigator must immediately notify the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 
Medical Monitor and record the event on a pregnancy surveillance form. While not an AE or SAE, 
the investigator must report every pregnancy using a pregnancy surveil lance form and follow the 
reporting procedures described for SAE reporting.  
 
Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy ( e.g., x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy

 follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the investigator must report 
to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.’s Medical Monitor on the pregnancy surveillance form, follow -up 
information regarding the course of the pregnancy, inc luding perinatal and neonatal outcome. 
Infants should be followed for a minimum of six weeks.    
 STATISTICAL ANALYSES    
12.1. Sample Size and Power Calculations  
The planned sample size is 12 subjects .  This is the first multi center study evaluating the effect of 
ATI-50002 Topical  Solution in subject s with stable alopecia universalis and alopecia totalis . No 
formal power calculations will be  performed.   
 
12.2. Analysis Populations

Analysis Plan and finalized prior to database lock.  
 
12.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject d emographic and baseline characteristics, including medical and alopecia history, prior 
medications and therapies and physical examination findings will be  summarized  using descriptive 
statistics.  
 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation, standard error, 
median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided.  For  categorical variables, subject  counts 
and percentages will b e provided.  Categories for missing data will be presented, if necessary.  
 
12.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Blood Samples  
Blood samples for analysis of the concentration of ATI -50002will be taken from the first 6 subjects 
enrolled into the study on Baseline/ Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 2 9 (Visit 7) at predose (0 hr), and 1, 
2, 4, 8  hours after study medication application  and on Day 2 (Visit 3 ) and Day 29 (Visit 7), 24 
hours post dose.   For each subject, standard  PK parameters  (Cmax, Tmax, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, t1/2) will 
be calculated, as a minimum and whenever possible, based on the plasma concentrations of  ATI-
50002 .   
 
Scalp Biopsy  
The concentration of ATI -50002 in skin will be determined in a 4 -mm punch biopsy of the scalp 
taken on Day 2 (Visit 3) and Day 29 (Visit 7) 24  hours post study medication  application in the 
office on Day 1 (Visit 2)  and Day 2 8 (Visit 6).

 et al, 2014, Jabbari 2016).  Change in ALADIN scores within individ ual subjects will be 
assessed be tween Baseline / Day 1  (Visit 2) , Day 2 9 (Visit 7) and Week 28 (Visit 13)  for subjects 
enrolled in the open -label extension .   
12.5.2.  Histology  
Scalp punch -biopsies will be formalin -fixed and paraffin -embedded and will be sectioned both 
vertically and horizontally by a qualified dermatopathologist.  Specimens will be stained with 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for “routine” histopathologic evaluation  that will include (but is not 
limited to) diagnosis and evaluation of the presence, quantity, location, and quality of any hair, 
hair follicles, and inflammatory infiltrate present.  Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) 
stains will be e mployed to ident ify immune cell populations ( e.g., Lymphocytes, cytotoxic T -
lymphocytes (CTLs)), and hair -specific keratins.  IHC stains to assess inflammatory responses will 
include but not be limited to, CD8, HLA -DR and ICAM -1.  Data will be presented as percent 
change from baseline in the number of cells/ high power field in regions of interest (peribulbar 
areas) and in percent change from baseline in the number of cells/mm2. 
 
12.5.3.  Blood  for Immunology  
Blood samples will be stained with cell surface antibodies for fluorescen ce acquisition cell sorting 
(FAC) analysis.  FACS experiments will allow for assessment of the subset and activation status 
of immune cells involved in AA.  
 
12.5.4.  Secondary Analyses  
Summary descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, SD) by visit will be provided f or all efficacy 
parameters.  Secondary efficacy parameters are described below:  
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints include mean change from baseline in the SALT score at Week 
28 (Visit 1 3), Week  40 (Visit 14) and Week  52 (Visit 15) .   
 
The percentage hair growth will be calculated as the mean change from Baseline (Visit  2) scores 
compared to end of treatment Week 2 8 (Visit 1 3), Week 40 (Visit 14) and Week 52 (Visit 15) .   
 
Mean change from baseline in the ALODEX score, proportion of subjects achieving a ≥ 5 0% hair 
growth compared with baseline.   
 
Treatment satisfaction will be summarized.  
 
The ALODEX score analysis will use the same methodology as specified for SALT score analysis.  
Other parameters will be analyzed as detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
 
Mean change from baseline in e yebrow growth will be calculated as the mean change in the 
Clinician’s Eyebrow Assessment (CEA) from entry into the long -term, open -label exten sion 
compared to Week 28(Visit 13), Week  40 (Visit 14) and Week 52 (Visit 15) .  The CEA evaluates 
eyebrows on a scale from “No eyebrow hair” ( Grade 0) to “Full eyebrow hair” ( Grade 4).

:  Subject  Instructions for Study Medication  Application  to the Scalp  
Preparation  and General Instructions :  
1. Gather a clean , dry washcloth and towel, the study medication  bottle and disposable 
dropper s. 
2. Scalp  should be clean  (free of any products  applied to the scalp ), and dry before apply ing 
study medication .  A clean scalp will allow the study medication  to penetrate down into 
the scalp to ensure you are getting the best ap plication. You should wash your scalp at 
least an hour prior to study medication application, at least once a day to prevent 
accumulation of study medication on your skin.  
3. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after using this study 
medication .  
4. You will apply a thin layer (a minimum of 1.5 up to a maximum of 4 mL) of study 
medication  to the entire scalp twice -a day approximately every 12 hours, as instructed by 
the s tudy doctor or the study staff .  On the first  and last days of study  medication dosing , 
you will apply study medication once -a-day only.   Once you apply study medication, do 
not wash your scalp  or participate in strenuous exercise that would cause profuse sweating 
for at least 6 hours.  
5. Avoid study medication contact with the eye.  If the study medication  gets on any part of 
your body other than your scalp, rinse the area well with water.  
6. Avoid exposing your scalp  to excessive natural or artificial ultraviolet radiation (e.g., 
sunlight, tannin g beds) and wear a hat or use sunscreen on your scalp , if excessive sun 
exposure cannot be avoided.  
7. Remember to bring your study medication  bottles (both used and unused ) to each study 
visit. 
8. Apply your study medication in the evening before Day 28 (Visit 6) and note the time.  
Do not apply your morning dose of study medication on your Day 28  (Visit 6) visit . 
9. Do not apply study medication to the area where the biopsy was performed until the 
study doctor indicates you are allowed.  
 
Study Medication  Application:  
1. Remove the cap from the bottle.  Squeeze the rubber bulb of the dropper and insert the 
dropper into the bottle.  Release the bulb, allowing the dropper to fill with the solution to 
the 1 mL line.  If the level of the solution is above the 1 mL line, squeeze the extra 
amount back into the bottle.  The study medication  level should be in line with the 1mL 
mark on the dropper .  
2. During study medication  application, k eep your head tilted back to avoid any study 
medication  running in to your eyes.  
3. Start to slowly deposit drops of study medication on the left side of your scalp from the 
front to the back.  Gently rub the solution into your scalp as you go , to avoid the 
medication from running off of your scalp .  
4. Draw up the next  droppe r of study medication  and repeat the process.  Work from the left 
to the right side of your scalp until   your entire scalp is covered with a  thin film of study 
medication .  The total amount of study medication you should apply per application is 
_____ mL.  
5. Replace the screw top cap and make sure it is closed tightly.   Dispose of the used 
dropper.

 6. Wash your hands thoroughly after using the study medication  to prevent any residue 
being left on your hands.  
7. Allow the study medication  to dry for at least 20 minutes  (or until completely dry)  before  
you cover your head with a hat, wig, or scarf to avoid transfer of study medication .   
8. If you missed any applications of study medication, be sure to inform the study staff at 
your next visit.  
9. Do not wash your scal p or participate in strenuous exercise that would cause profuse 
sweating for at least 6  hours after applying study medication .  
Wigs and Hairpieces  
1. Wigs and hairpieces may be worn while participating in the study but must be 
appropriately managed.  
2. Wigs or hairpieces should not be worn until the study medication is completely dry on 
the scalp.  Thus, wigs or hairpieces should not be reapplied for at least 20 minutes after 
the study drug has been applied.  
3. Wigs and hairpieces will need to be removed a t each study visit to allow the study doctor 
to evaluate your scalp and hair loss.  Any hairpieces that may be difficult to remove will 
prevent you from participating in the study.  Do not have semi permanent or diffi cult to 
remove hairpieces applied  durin g the study.  Hair “weaves” that only involve areas of the 
scalp that continue to have hair may be accepted on a case by case basis.  
4. If scalp irritation develops during the study, it may be necessary to temporarily stop 
wearing of a hairpiece or wig.  The study doctor will discuss this with you should scalp 
irritation develop.

:  Scalp Biopsy  
All scalp p unch biopsies will be performed by the investigator according to the Schedule of Events 
in Section  7.3. Note:  The scalp biopsy for pharmacokinetic analysis performed on Day 2 and 
Day 29 should be obtained after the area of the scalp to be biopsied is tape stripped using 5 
D-Squame circular discs.  
 
The biopsy site will be anesthetized with an injection of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine. The 
lidocaine with epinephrine may be neutralized with bicarbonate to prevent stinging.  After 
approximately 1 minute, the physician will appl y pressure to the biopsy site using a 4mm diameter 
skin punch (a sterile cylindrical tube with a sharp edge). The punch is twisted until the blade of the 
skin punch has pierced the epidermis and dermis of the skin and enters the subcutaneous fat. 
Depending  on the thickness of the skin in the area being biopsied, the cylindrical blade may be 
buried to the hub (approximately 6mm in depth). After the blade has sufficiently cored or carved 
out a cylinder of skin, the skin punch is removed. Nontraumatic forceps are used to gently grasp 
the cored skin, pulling upward to remove the core and reveal the subcutaneous fat. Scissors are 
used to cut the cored tissue free from the underlying subcutaneous fat. Care should be taken to 
ensure that the specimen is cut well be low the level of the hair follicle.  The specimen is placed 
immediately into the appropriate media. Once the specimen has been removed, pressure is applied 
to the biopsy site with a sterile 2 x 2 gauze. The biopsy site is then closed with several simple 
interrupted sutures. Either an absorbable or nonabsorbable suture may be used at the investigator’s 
discretion. Antibiotic ointment is applied,  and the area is covered with a standard Band -Aid or 
sterile gauze and paper tape. If the presence of adjacent hair  makes adhesion of a bandage difficult, 
antibiotic ointment will be used without a covering. When necessary, a small pressure dressing 
may be applied. Subjects will be instructed in wound care , to avoid applying study medication  to 
the biopsy site until th e sutures are removed  and will be advised to call the research unit if they 
have any concerning signs or symptoms during healing.   A follow -up visit will  be scheduled 
approximately 2 weeks later, to remove sutures , if necessary,  and examine the healing pro cess of 
the biopsy site to ensure it is healing appropriately.

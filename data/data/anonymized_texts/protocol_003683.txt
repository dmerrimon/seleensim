Page 5 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] 1.0 Project Summary/Abstract  96 
Physical inactivity in asthma is associated w ith worse asthma outcomes and African 97 
American women are disproportionately impacted by both physical inactivity and 98 
asthma. Research aimed at addressing the unique asthma -related and cultural -specific 99 
barriers to physical activity in this vulnerable population of women is needed. The 100 
proposed study will modify a validated community -based walking intervention specific to 101 
the needs of sedentary African American women with asthma and evaluate the impact 102 
of the intervention on physical activity and asthma specific indicators to reduce the 103 
burden of asthma in sedentary African American women.  104

Page 6 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] 2.0 Background/Scientific Rationale  106 
Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease that disproportionately impacts African 107 
American (AA) women. AA women have poorer asthma -related quality of life and h igher 108 
rates of asthma exacerbations, healthcare utilization and mortality  compared to 109 
Caucasian women. Further, AA women are less physically active than any other 110 
subgroup of adults, which may help explain the asthma health disparities, found 111 
between AA an d Caucasian women. Physical inactivity among individuals with asthma 112 
is associated with poor asthma control and respiratory function, greater health care 113 
utilization, and poorer quality of life. Given the connection between poor asthma 114 
outcomes and physica l inactivity, addressing physical activity (PA) among sedentary AA 115 
women with asthma is imperative. Physical activity demonstrated improvement in 116 
asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, quality of life and healthcare utilization. 117 
Despite these benefit s, fewer than 25% of AA women with asthma engage in regular 118 
physical activity. The ACTION intervention: physic Al aCtiviTy In min Ority wome N 119 
with asthma is a 8 -month community -based walking intervention refined to be 120 
applicable for sedentary AA women with asthma.  121 
 122 
This project will obtain and incorporate stakeholder input on the barriers and facilitators 123 
to engaging in physical activity with asthma to a validated community -based walking 124 
intervention . Once modified, we will pre -pilot the intervention in 10 participants, refine 125 
further  in response to participant feedback and then test the feasibility, acceptability and 126 
estimate the efficacy of the intervention in a randomized controlled pilot of 80 127 
participants within a pragmatic community setting convenient for sedentary AA women.   128 
 129 
 130 
3.0 Objectives/Aims  131 
The proposed  study  has 5 aims  involving  a total of 135 sedentary  AA women  with 132 
asthma.   133 
 134 
NOTE:  Aims 1 and 2 have been  IRB approved  and completed.  Only data analysis  of 135 
these  2 aims  are still occurring.  At this time,  I am requesting  approval  for Aim 3 which  136 
entails  pilot testing  the intervention  to assess  the feasibility,  acceptability  and to 137 
estimate  the efficacy  of the ACTION  intervention.   138 
 139 
Aim 1: Use stakeholder  input  to modify  a validated  walking  intervention  for sedentary  140 
AA women  with asthma.  141 
 142 
Aim 1a: Conduct  focus  groups  in 30 sedentary  AA women  with asthma  to assess  PA 143 
barriers  and facilitators.  144 
 145 
Aim 1b: Adapt  a validated  walking  intervention  that addresses  the barriers  and 146 
facilitators  to PA unique  to sedentary  AA women  with asthma  obtained  from Aim 1A. 147 
 148 
 149 
Aim 2: Pre-pilot test ACTION  (physicAl  aCtiviTy  In minOrity  womeN  with asthma)  150 
intervention  in up to 10 sedentary  AA women  with asthma  to refine  the recruitment  151

 155 
 156 
Aim 3: Pilot test ACTION  intervention  in 80 sedentary  AA women  with asthma  to 157 
assess  acceptability,  feasibility  and estimate  the efficacy  to appropriately  power  a 158 
subsequent  efficacy  trial.  159 
 160 
 161 
 162 
Aim 4 : Modify and refine the video component of the intervention to address the 163 
asthma -specific barriers to walking in AA women with asthma.  164 
Aim 4 a: Conduct a focus group with an Asthma Advisory Council (AAC) that includes up 165 
to 15 AA women with asthma, to asse ss the appropriateness of the proposed asthma 166 
content, language and setting used in the videos.   167 
Aim 4 b: Adapt the video component of the intervention using an iterative approach to 168 
include appropriate asthma content, language and setting.  169 
 170 
Aim 5 : Assess  the acceptability of the revised videos by the AAC using a mixed 171 
methods approach (qualitative and quantitative data).  172 
 173 
Aim 6:  Disseminate research findings and next steps to women that participated in 174

 178 
Participant s will be recruited from the UI Health System .  179 
 180 
• Eligibility considerations : We chose to focus on sedentary AA women with 181 
sub-optimally contro lled persistent asthma   (based on ACQ score 1.5/Appendix 182 
1 OR ACT score 20/Appendix 2) as long-term goal is to see an effect change in 183 
asthma control. During our focus groups, we will discuss if there is a preferred 184 
age range and will refine the intervention accordingly. Focus group participants 185 
did not express a preferred age range so a diverse age range of participants will 186 
be recruited to ensure representation from a diverse population of AA women 187 
with asthma . Women that have c ompleted participation in Aims 1, 2, or 3 of this 188 
study will be able t o participate in Aims 4 and 5 of the study.  189

 242 
We will use the Exercise Assessment and Screening for You (EASY) questionnaire  243 
(Appendix 3 to detect the presence of conditions that could preclude study participatio n. 244 
Current physical activity ( PA) screening guidelines from a consensus group from the 245 
American Heart Association and the American College of  Cardiology  no longer 246 
recommend routine stress testing for those initiating a PA program. The EASY  247 
questionnaire  has clear recommendations for when evaluation by a physician is needed 248 
before beginning a PA program (e.g., when the individual reports new -onset shortness 249 
of breath, pain, or dizziness that has not been previously evaluated by a health care 250 
provider), and w e will follow these recommendations.   251 
 252 
If the EASY questionnaire recommends that a potential participant be evaluated by a 253 
health care provider prior to starting a PA program, the potential participant will be 254 
asked to contact their health care provider  or we will obtain permission from the 255 
participant to contact their UI Health provider . We will send their UI Health provider a 256 
secure message describing the study and it’s procedures and the results of their 257 
patient’s EASY questionnaire. We will r equest a response regarding permission of entry 258 
into the study. Permission from their health care provider will be required prior to 259 
participation in any study activities.  260 
 261 
Exclusion criteria for spirometry procedure only done at 1 data collection visit 262 
(Visit 1) in the pre -pilot and 3 data collection visits in the pilot : chest or abdominal 263 
surgery in previous 6 weeks, detached retina or eye surgery in previous month.  264

these ex clusion criteria, then spirometry will not be performed.  266 
 267 
4.2.c . Aims 4 and 5 268 
• Plans to move from Chicago during the study period  269 
• Diagnosis of COPD (emphysema or chronic bronchitis) suggested by patient 270 
report of doctor diagnosis or smoking history (>20 pa ck years)  271 
• Inability to speak, read or understand English;  272 
• Investigator discretion for safety or protocol adherence reasons  273 
 274 
4.3 Excluded or Vulnerable Populations  275 
EXCLUSION OF MINORS  Although asthma  is a disease that affects both children and 276 
adults the focus of this proposal is to specifically modify and pilot test an existing 277 
physical activity intervention in sedentary African American women with asthma. 278 
Children are intentionally being excluded, a s currently there is insufficient data available 279 
in African American adults  with asthma  to judge the potential risk of this intervention in 280 
children.   281 
 282 
INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES  The focus population for this study is 283 
sedentary African -American (AA) women with asthma. All participants included in the 284 
study will self -identify themselves as female and black or AA. This study population was 285 
chosen as AA women are disproportionately im pacted by physical inactivity and asthma 286 
compared to Caucasian men and women and AA men. In particular, AA women have 287 
the highest rates of asthma -related mortality and asthma -related health -care utilization. 288 
Physical inactivity in asthma is particularly re levant because it is associated with worse 289 
asthma outcomes, specifically, poor asthma control and respiratory function, greater 290 
health care utilization, and poorer quality of life. Rese arch aimed at addressing physical 291 
inactivity and asthma control in this  vulnerable population of women is needed.  292 
 293 
5.0 Subject Enrollment  294 
Potential  participants  will be identified  using  3 methods:  1) Using  a validated  electronic  295 
health  record  (EHR)  algorithm  (Appendix  4) that identifies  asthma  patients  with a high 296 
sensitivity  and specificity  (99%  and 96%,  respectively) [1];  2) From  healthcare  providers  297 
in internal  medicine,  pulmonary  and allergy/asthma  clinics  at UI Health ; 3) From  women  298 
that were  screened  in Aims  1-3 and provided  permission  to contact  them  for future  299 
studies .  300 
 301 
5.1 Asthma  algorithm  identification  302 
The EHR  asthma  algorithm  will be performed  by Dr. William  Galanter,  co-investigator . 303 
We have  experience  using  this EHR  algorithm  at UIC for an ongoing  asthma  study,  304 
CAPriCORN  (ChairB  Protocol  #14111301 ). A HIPAA  waiver  will be obtained  for this 305 
research  to allow  us to gather  information  about  potential  study  participants  and contact  306 
the potential  participants.  Two methods  of recruitment  will be used:  in-person  and 307 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 11 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] mailings.  In-person  recruitment  will occur  in the UI Health  outpatient  clinics.  We will 308 
approach  potenti al participants  who are already  coming  to UI Health  for an appointment.  309 
In a given  week,  we will verify  ahead  of time what  potential  participants  are coming  to 310 
the clinics  that have  also been  identified  through  the EHR  asthma  algorithm.  A research  311 
assistan t(s) will come  to the outpatient  clinic  for the potential  participant's  appointment,  312 
obtain  verbal  agreement  from potential  participant's  doctor/provider  to approach  the 313 
potential  participant,  then approach  the potential  participant  and give a brief introd uction  314 
about  the study  and ask screening  questions  to assess  eligibility.  If eligible  and 315 
interested,  the study  will be introduced  to the potential  participant  and if interested  316 
scheduled  for a focus  group  session  (Aim 1) or the first study  visit (baseline  interview  317 
and initial  data collection)  which  will take place  in the Clinical  Research  Center  at UIC 318 
(Aim 2 and 3).  Alternatively,  the recruiter  and potential  participant  can set up another  319 
day or a phone  call to assess  eligibility,  describe  the study  and/or  schedule  the initial  320 
visit. All patients  approached  must  be identified  by our EHR  asthma  algorithm.   321 
 322 
For mail recruitment,  letters  along  with a response  card will be sent to women  identified  323 
by the algorithm . Within  1 week,  telephone  contact  will be made  unless  the response  324 
card is returned  indicating  that they are not interested.  Participants  will be called  up to 5 325 
times  to recruit  a potential  subject  via telephone.  If the potential  participant  doesn’t  326 
answer  the phone  call, a recruitment  voicemail  will be left up to 5 times.  A brief 327 
telephone  screen  will assess  eligibility , describe  the study  and interest  in participation.  If 328 
interested  and eligible,  patients  will be scheduled  for a focus  group  (Aim 1) or the first 329 
study  visit (baseline  interview  and initial  data collection)  which  will take place  in the 330 
Clinical  Research  Center  at UIC (Aim 2 and 3). Written  informe d consent  will be 331 
obtained  in person  in a private  area prior to starting  the focus  group  session  (Aim 1) or 332 
the base line interview  and data collection  (Aim 2 and 3) for all participants.  333 
 334 
 335 
5.2 Healthcare provider identification  336 
In our second  selection  strategy,  a research  assistant  (RA) will work  closely  with 337 
healthcare  providers  who see a lot of patients  with asthma  in their clinics  (Internal  338 
Medicine,  Pulmonary  and Allergy/Asthma).   339 
1. The RA will go to Internal  Medicine,  Pulmonary  and/or  Allergy/Asthma  clinics  and 340 
introduce  themselves  to the healthcare  providers  and provide  them  a brief 341 
synopsis  of the research  study  (See  study  synopsis  V1 11_20_17).   342 
2. The RA will ask healthcare  providers  for potential  participant's  that have  343 
physician  diagnosed  asthma  and obtain  verbal  agreement  from the healthcare  344 
provider  to approach  the potential  participant.   345 
3. The RA will approach  the patient  and give a brief introduction  about  the study  346 
and ask screening  questions  to assess  eligibility  using  the in-person  screening  347 
script .  348 
4. If the patient  is eligible  and interested,  the study  will be introduced  to them and if 349 
interested  scheduled  for the first study  visit (baseline  interview  and initial  data 350 
collection)  which  will take place  in the Clinical  Research  Center  at UIC (Aim 3).   351

Page 12 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] 5. Alternatively,  the potential  participant  may be given  a flyer about  the study  or the 352 
recruiter  and potential  participant  can set up another  time to assess  eligibility,  353 
describe  the study  and/or  schedule  the initial  visit by phone  or in-person.  354 
 355 
5.3 Women  screened  for Aims  1-3 356 
1. Women  that were  screened  for Aims  1-3 AND  provided  permission  to contact  357 
them  for future  phases  of this research  will be contacted  via preferred  method  of 358 
contact  (phone/text/email).  The RA will contact  the participant  and give a brief 359 
introduction  about  the study  and ask screening  questions  to assess  eligibility  360 
using  the telephone  screening  script .  361 
2. If the patient  is eligible  and interested,  the study  will be introduced  to them and if 362 
interested  the RA will obtain  times  that are ideal  for the participant  for the focus  363 
group.   364 
 365 
 366 
5.4 Eligibility  Screening  367 
If a participant  does  not meet  eligibility  criteria  during  screening , this will be indicated  on 368 
an encrypted  data sheet so that participant s are not approached  multiple  times.  The de- 369 
identified  data collected  from the screen  failures  will be entered  into REDCap  by key 370 
research  personnel.   371 
 372 
The principal investigator will separate clinical responsibilities and influence from the 373 
recruitment process  by having key research personnel perform eligibility screening and 374 
informed consent of potential  participants . The physicians will be informed of the study 375 
and its’ objectives at a faculty meeting  and will be asked if they have any concerns 376 
regard their patients’ participation.  377 
 378 
6.0 Study Design and Procedures  379 
  380 
Aim 1 (focus groups)  381 
We will randomly select 160 women with the goal of recruiting a random samp le of 3 0 382 
women.  We will use the recruitment method described above in Section 5.0. 383 
Participants will be selected to ensure representation of a range of asthma severity and 384 
current age . The sample size is determined by the theoretical saturation or the  point 385 
when no new id eas relevant to the question are obtained, which is generally 15 [2]. 386 
However, a minimum of 20 is recommended for illness studies [3]. This study includes 387 
30 participants in groups of 6 -10 for focus groups . If redundancy is not noted in the 388 
focus group discussion, additional participants will be included until saturation is 389 
reached.    390 
 391 
To ensure that the focus group s are responsive to the participants and unexpected 392 
themes that might emerge, data analysis will begin after the first focus group data are 393 
entered and continue throughout the focus group phase.  394 
 395

Page 13 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] Study Procedures for Aim 1:  396 
1. Complete eligibility screening.    397 
2.  Securing informed consent.  398 
3.  Complete a brief demographic form.  (Appendix 5) 399 
4.  Attend one 2 hour focus group and provide perspective on issues such as 400 
physical activity and asthma.  Provide feedback and recommendations on 401 
recruitment materials, content structure, and approach of ACTION intervention.  402 
 403 
Drs. Nyenhuis and Sharp will moderate all focus groups using an interview guide  404 
(Appendix  6) with semi -structured open -ended q uestions . The interview guide  will be 405 
pre-tested for clarity, comprehension, and sensitivity  and will provide sufficient flexibility 406 
to pursue unanticipated facets of topics that emerge in focus group discussions [4].  407 
 408 
Each  group will last approximately 2 hours and be audio -recorded and subsequently 409 
transcribed  by a member of the research team . Patients will complete written consent,  410 
receive $50 (gift card or cash)  and light snacks/ refreshments.   411 
 412 
The focus groups will take place in a private space in one of 3 places:  413 
1. Chicago Park District location that is in close approximation to where the 414 
participants live . The exact location will be determined with the help of the 415 
Chicago Park Di strict liaison and will take into account safety of the participants 416 
and the location of where participants live.  417 
2. The University of Illinois at Chicago Institute of Health Research and Policy  418 
3. For participants that are interested but unable to any other th e other scheduled 419 
visits, we will arrange for an individual interview at UI Health.  420 
 421 
The Chicago Park District will only host focus groups and no Chicago Park District staff 422 
are involved in the research as recruiters or to collect data.  423 
 424 
Key research per sonnel will send a reminder text and/or call the patient (based on 425 
patient preference) 24-48 hours prior to the focus group stating “UIC group will meet at 426 
X time and X place .”  427 
 428 
Aim 2 (P re-pilot)   429 
We will select up to 10 women using the recruitment method described above in Section 430 
5.0. Potential participants and p articipants for Aim 1 will be eligible to participate in Aim 431 
2 if they expressed an interest to participate  in future phases of the study . Participants 432 
will be selected to e nsure representation of a range of asthma severity and current age .  433

Visits 2 -4 will take place at UI Health/ UIC or a Chicago Park District  (CPD)  location that 487 
is in close approximation to where the participants live. The exact CPD location will be 488 
determined with the help of the Chi cago Park District liaison and will take into account 489 
safety of the participants and the location of where participants live. The Chicago Park 490 
District will only provide space for these visits and no Chicago Park District staff are 491 
involved in the research  as recruiters or to collect data.  492 
 493 
At visits 2 -4 the following procedures will occur : 494 
1. Collection of accelerometers  (Visit 2  only)  and Fitbit (Visit 4 only) .  495 
2. Attend a 2 hour group session at the Chicago Park District or at UI 496 
Health/UIC. At the group session, participants will receive b asic asthma 497 
education , physical activity education and watch a video on how to get started 498 
to walk. Participants will be asked to share their e xperiences with asthma and 499 
physical activity.  500

Page 16 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] Key research personnel will send a reminder text, call and/or email (based on patient 509 
preference) up to 3 times the prior week to the group session stating “ACTION group 510 
will meet at X time and X place .”  511 
 512 
Reminder messages will also be sent via phone, text or email (based on participant 513 
preference) up to 3 times per week to help them attain their weekly step goal  (See 514 
Appendix 11 for sample text messaging ).  515 
 516 
An interventionist and/or Dr. Nyenhuis will atte nd the group sessions. Each  group will 517 
last approximately 2 hours and be audio -recorded to assess for intervention fidelity. If a 518 
participant declines audio -recording the session, then the session will not be recorded. 519 
The PI or co -investigator may then ob serve a group session intermittently to assess for 520 
intervention fidelity.  If the session is recorded, the PI will review portions of the session. 521 
The sessions will be deleted once the pre -pilot is complete. These audio recordings will 522 
not be transcribed. Patients will re ceive  light snacks/ refreshments  at each session .  523

Participants will then be provided the following equipment at Visit 2 and wi ll be asked to 528 
return on Visit 4 : 529 
1) Fitbit® physical activity monitor : Participants will b e verbally instructed to wear it on 530 
their wrist at all times while awake. The Fitbit (Figure 3.a) is a commercially -available 531 
physical activity monitor  (0.83 inches wide, weight 0.8 ounces ). The wristbands are 532 
adjustable and data from our focus groups reve aled that participants would prefer a 533 
wrist-based than a waist -based physical activity monitor.  Participants will be asked to 534 
download the fitbit app to their smartphone or tablet and asked to create an account. 535 
Participants will be referred to the Fitbit  website for troubleshooting. This will allow for 536 
physical activity data transmission to the Fitbit study database  which will not contain any 537 
identifiable information . A previous survey found that over 90% of our patients had a 538 
smartphone or tablet.  If a p articipant is unable to or does not want to download the fitbit 539 
app then they will write their daily steps into a journal  which they will bring to each study 540 
visit. Participants will not be responsible for the cost of the Fitbit if it is lost or stolen.  541

and post -intervention daily number of steps. Participants will be verbally instructed 614 
to wear it attached to their w rist at all times while awake. The Act igraph 615 
acceleromet er (Figure 3) is a research accelerometer (1.8 inches at its largest 616 
dimension, weight 19 g rams). This will be returned within 2 weeks of the data 617 
collection v isit. The accelerometers can be returned either in person at the asthma 618 
and PA session, in a postage paid envelope  or the participant and the research 619 
assistant will find a mutually agreeable place to pick up the accelerometer from the 620 
participant. The participa nt will not incur any charges if the accelerometer is lost or 621 
stolen. The data from the accelerometers will be downloaded to Actigraph software 622 
(ActiLife 6.13.3) when the accelerometers are returned. Only study ID will be used 623

Actigraph software.   625 
 626 
Participants are typically asked to wear the accelerometer for 7 days (does not 627 
have to be consecutive).  However, valid baseline measurement of activity can be 628 
obtained with an aver age of 10 hours per day for 4 days.  This is the minimum 629 
amount of accelerometer data required to continue participation in the intervention.  630 
If the participant does not wear the accelerometer for sufficient time to provide valid 631 
baseline measure (ie. an average of 10 hours per day for 4 days), they will be 632 
offered a second opportunity to wear the  accelerometer . If the participant declines 633 
or is unable to wear the accelerometer again within 3 weeks  of returning the 634 
accelerometer , then the participant will be withdrawn from the study . 635 
 636 
Enhanced Usual Care Group  (home -based walking program) : The comparison 637 
group will be instructed to achieve a static goal of 10,000  steps per day . The US 638 
Surgeon General recommends accumulating 30 minutes of activity most days  of the 639 
week. Assuming that an individual gets 6,000 steps  from their other daily activities, 30 640 
minutes of walking can help one achieve a goal of approximately 10,000 steps per  day.  641 
 642 
Participants will be given a Fitbit Charge HR ® which will measure their daily steps (see 643 
more detail below under visit 2) . In order to attention -match for interactions with study 644 
staff, participants will attend an asthma education and physical acti vity training session. 645 
Newsletters with walking tips for AA women  and asthma education topics  will be sent 646 
twice during the intervention phases  to participants in this group . Participants will come 647 
to the Clinical Research Center for data collection a t wee ks 24  (Visit 7b)  and 36  (Visit 9)  648 
described in more detail below.  649 
 650 
Asthma  and physical activity  (PA) education session  for all participants (1 -6 651 
weeks after baseline data collection visit)  652 
The asthma and PA education session will take place at UI Health/UIC or a Chicago 653 
Park District (CPD) location that is in close approximation to where the participants live. 654 
The exact C PD location will be determined with the help of the Chicago Park District 655 
liaison and will take into account safety of the participants and the location of where 656 
participants live. The Chicago Park District will only provide space for these visits and 657 
no C hicago Park District staff are involved in the research as recruiters or to collect 658 
data.  Two separate asthma/PA education  sessions will take place, one for enhanced 659 
usual care group and one for those randomized into the intervention group.   660 
 661 
At the asthma /PA education session  the following procedures will occur:  662 
1. Collection of accelerometers for those that have not already returned it.  663 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 20 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] 2. Attend a 2 hour group session at the Chicago Park District or at UI 664 
Health/UIC. At the group session, participants will rec eive didactic asthma 665 
education and info rmation on how to engage in physical activity with their 666 
asthma.   667 
3. Participants will be asked to complete a ses sion evalution form. (Appendix 9 ) 668 
4. Participants will be given $5 cash to assist with travel expenses incurr ed for 669 
the visit.  670 
 671 
Key research personnel will send a reminder text, call and/or email (based on patient 672 
preference) up to 3 times the prior week to the group session stating “ Asthma and 673 
physical activity session will meet at X time and X place .”  674 
 675 
An asthma educator, a research assistant(s) and/or Dr . Nyenhuis will attend the 676 
education  session. Each  education  session  will last approximately 2 hours. Patients will 677 
receive light snacks/ refreshments  at each session .  678 
 679 
For missed sessions, make -up sessions  will be offered (in -person or by video). 680 
Continuation in the program will be decided by the PI on a case by case basis. 681 
Participants will be strongly encouraged to make up missed sessions prior to the next 682 
scheduled group session (intervention group) or d ata collection visit (enhanced usual 683 
care group).  684 
 685 
Participants will be given the following equipment at the asthma/PA education session : 686 
1) Fitbit® physical activity monitor : Participants will be verbally instructed to wear it on 687 
their wrist at all times while awake. The Fitbit (Figure 4 ) is a commercially -available 688 
physical activity monitor  (0.83 inches wide, weight 0.8 ounces ). The wristbands are 689 
adjustable and data from our focus groups revealed that participants would prefer a 690 
wrist-based than a waist -based physical activity monitor.  Participants will be asked to 691 
download the fitbit app to their smartphone or tablet and asked to create an account . 692 
Participants will be referred to the Fitbit website for troubleshooting. This will allow for 693 
physical activity data transmission to the Fitbit study database which will not contain any 694 
identifiable information. If a participant is unable to or does not w ant to download the 695 
fitbit app then they will write their daily steps into a journal which they will bring to each 696 
study visit. Participants will not be responsible for the cost of the Fitbit if it is lost or 697 
stolen.  698 
 699 
Daily physical activity , heart rate  and status of the Fitbit (e.g., battery) will be monitored 700 
in real time  using a Fitbit study database . Only physical activity data (i.e., step counts, 701 
time worn using heart rate, minutes active, distance walked)  of the participant will be 702 
kept in the Fitbit study database . This is necessary for recording of detailed physical 703

[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 21 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] activity data as the pedometers have limited data storage capacity . Only study ID will be 704 
used in the Fitbit study database. No identifiable information will be maintained in the 705 
Fitbit d atabase.  706 
 707 
Group sessions (Intervention group only): Women randomized into the intervention 708 
group will also attend group sessions in 2 phases: Adoption and Maintenance (See 709 
Figure 2).  710 
 711 
Adoption phase (5 sessions  every 4  weeks)  712 
The group session  will take place at UI Health/UIC or a Chicago Park District (CPD) 713 
location that is in close approximation to where the participants live. The exact CPD 714 
location will be determined with the help of the Chicago Park District liaison and will take 715 
into accou nt safety of the participants and the location of where participants live. The 716 
Chicago Park District will only provide space for these visits and no Chicago Park 717 
District staff are involved in the research as recruiters , interventionists, asthma 718 
educators  or to collect data.   719 
 720 
At each group session the following will occur:  721 
1. Women will a ttend a 2 hour group session at the Chicago Park District or at 722 
UI Health/UIC. At the group session, participants will continue to receive 723 
asthma education  (short videos and/ or didactic session) , watch a video on 724 
how to get started to walk  and what barriers they may face . Participants will 725 
be asked to share their experiences engaging in physical activity with asthma.  726 
2. Participant will be given an individualized step -goal not t o exceed 3000 steps 727 
above their baseline calculated from accelerometer data  over the entire 728 
course of the study .  729 
3. Each participant will be given an ACTION p articipant manual (1st group 730 
session only) . 731 
4. Participants will be encouraged to walk during the group  session for up to 15 732 
minutes. The interventionist and Chicago Park District liais on will identify safe 733 
locations for the women to walk at the group session site. Women will be able 734 
to walk at their own pace and stop at anytime. If the participant does not  want 735 
to participate in the walking portion of the group visit they may opt -out by 736

Aims 4 & 5 (Adapting Intervention Tools)  893 
We will recruit up to 15 AA women with asthma from our database of ~80 AA women 894 
with asthma that have given us permission to contact them for research studies. These 895 
women have already been identified as having asthma either through physician 896 
diagnosis and/or the use of a  validated electronic health record (EHR) algorithm that 897 
identifies asthma patients with a high sensitivity and specificity (99% and 96%, 898 
respectively) [15, 16] . Potential participants will be contacted and asked screening 899 
questions to ensure they are still in our target age range of 18 -70 years. Participants will 900 
be selected to ensure representation of age ranges. The  sample size is determined by 901 
the theoretical saturation or the point when no new ideas relevant to the question are 902

Page 26 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] obtained, which is generally 15 [17].  903 
 904 
Study Procedures for Aim s 4 and 5 : 905 
1. Complete eligibility screening.    906 
2.  Securing informed consent.  907 
3.  Complete a brief demographic form.  (Appendix 5)  908 
4.  Attend three 90 minute focus group s and provide perspective on issues such 909 
as video content, video scene selection and final video product.  910 
 911 
Drs. Nyenhuis and a nurse interventionist will moderate all focus groups using an 912 
interview guide  (Appendix 12) with semi -structured open -ended q uestions. The 913 
interview guide  will be pre -tested for clarity, comprehension, and sensitivity  and will 914 
provide sufficient flexibility to pursue unanticipated facets of topics that emerge in focus 915 
group discussions [4].  916 
 917 
Each  group will last approximately 90 minutes and be audio -recorded and subsequently 918 
transcribed. If one of the focus group members decline to be audio -recorded the 919 
session will n ot be audio -recorded and only field notes will be collected. Patients will 920 
complete written consent  (1st session only) , receive $50 (cash) and light 921 
snacks/ refreshments  at each focus group .  922 
 923 
The focus groups will take place in a private space at t he University of Illinois at 924 
Chicago.  925 
 926 
Key research personnel will send a reminder text and/or call the patient (based on 927 
patient preference) 24 -48 hours prior to the focus group stating “ ACTION asthma group 928 
will meet at X time and X place .”  929 
 930 
Aim 6 (Dissemination of study findings to study participants ) 931 
We will disseminate our study findings and next steps to study participants by way of a 932 
newsletter. Using feedback from the CCTS Community  Advisory Board we developed 933 
three newsletters to be disseminated to our study participants. The newsletters focus on 934 
thanking our participants, study findings, next steps and educational content related to 935 
physical activity and/or asthma. The newsletter w ill be sent on a monthly basis for 3 936 
months and will be disseminated by email, text or mail based on the preferred 937 
communication each participant indicated in the study. A pdf of the newsletters will be 938 
also available on Dr. Nyenhuis’ Department of Medicin e Research Page.  939 
 940 
7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits  941 
 942 
The research involves minimal risk:  943 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 27 of 38 [3-9-2020 ]  944 
1. There is a chance that answering questions about their health may cause 945 
participants to become upset or distressed.  If this should happen during a focus 946 
group  or group session , the participant may take a break from the group or leave 947 
the group entirely.   948 
2. Questionnaires:  given that some questions ask personal information; it is 949 
possible that participants will be uncomfortable answering them. Participants will 950 
be ex plained they do not have to answer any question they are uncomfortable 951 
with. 952 
3. There is also a chance for loss of privacy and loss of confidentiality in the unlikely 953 
event that unauthorized persons should see study data.  Many protections will be 954 
taken to de crease the chances that this happens.  955 
4. Spirometry (lung function test) : risks associated with spirometry are minimal for 956 
most people. Because the test involves rapid and forced breathing, some people 957 
may experience temporary (lasting up to a few minutes) s hortness of breath, 958 
lightheadedness and minor chest soreness. In rare cases, the participant may 959 
hyperventilate and become dizzy during spirometric testing. Any participant who 960 
feels faint should be guided onto the chair with her head down towards the 961 
knee s, and encouraged to breathe slowly and deeply until she recovers. If the 962 
participant fails to recover normal breathing, faints, or reports feeling ill, the 963 
research assistant will  summon the CRC nurse  manager and physician 964 
immediately. The physician should always be consulted if there is any question 965 
regarding the participant’s safety status during the exam.  966 
5. Risk of pulmonary event: subjects will be asked to increase their daily physical 967 
activity  and will perform up to 15 minutes of walking during the intervention group 968 
sessions , so there is the possibility of a pulmonary complication, such as an 969 
increase in respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, wheezing). We will 970 
minimize this risk b y care ful participant selection. Previous studies have shown 971 
the safety of increasing physical activity in sub -optimally controlled persistent 972 
asthma (Ma J et al.  Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2015; 12(1): 1 –11.) 973 
 974 
Participants may have direct personal benefits fr om participating in the pre -pilot and 975 
pilot, as they will receive asthma education and learn how to best exercise with asthma. 976 
Further , participants may enjoy talking with other people  about their experience s with 977 
asthma and physical activity. The participant’s  involvement will offer important 978 
information that will help refine  and test the feasibility and acceptability of  a physical 979 
activity program to improve the life of women with asthma.  980 
 981 
8.0 Data Collection and Management Procedures  982 
Data  collected  during  screening  of participants  will be entered  into REDCap  by key 983 
research  personnel.  For subjects  that are interested  in participating  in future  studies  or 984 
future  phases  of the study,  their contact  information  will be entered  and secured  in a 985 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 28 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] REDCap  database.  The asthma  algorithm  output  (raw data) will only be seen  by Dr. 986 
Galanter . The data from the algorithm  that is needed  to contact  the potential  participants  987 
(name,  address,  phone  number , date of birth and medical  record  number)  will be kept 988 
within  the hospital  intranet,  behind  the clinical  hospital  firewall  that is password  989 
protected  and will be accessed  only by the PI and selected  key research  personnel.  990 
 991 
The data from the focus groups  (Aims 1, 4 and 5)  will be in the form of audio recordings  992 
with no use of names . Drs. Nyenhuis and Sharp will review focus group transcriptions to 993 
identify recurring  themes especially those focused on barriers and enablers to 994 
PA/walking  and video adaptation and video acceptability . We will explore the distribution 995 
across the groups by key variables such as asthma severity and age.  In this manner, 996 
analysis will consider the context of t he responses including characteristics of the 997 
participants [5]. Information drawn from focus groups will n ot be shared with group 998 
participants . The audio of the focus groups will be destroyed after transcription . The 999 
transcript data will be destroyed immediately before the research has been closed via a 1000  
Final Report.   1001  
 1002  
The data from the pre -pilot and pilot  will be in the form of a demographics form, surveys, 1003  
Fitbit data ( step counts, time worn using heart rate, minutes active, distance walked ), 1004  
accelerometer data  and spirometry results. Each form, survey or report will  have the 1005  
participant’s study ID only. The participant’s height and weight will be directly entered 1006  
into REDCap  by key research personnel. After each study visit, key research personnel 1007  
will ensure that the data is entered into the REDCap  database. Paper c opies of the 1008  
demographics form, paper surveys  (if used) , and spirometry results will be kept in a 1009  
locked cabinet or drawer separate from the study ID code. The paper copies will be 1010  
destroyed immediately before the research has been closed via a Final Repor t. 1011  
Electronic REDCap  surveys will also be used and once complete will be automatically 1012  
transferred into REDCap . 1013  
 1014  
Other  clinical  data (ie. laboratory  data,  pulmonary  function  tests, sleep  tests) will be 1015  
obtained  from the participant’s  UI Health  electronic  medical  record  (EMR) . This data will 1016  
be entered  into REDCap  and will have  the participant’s  study  ID only. This data will be 1017  
used  to assess  the feasibility  and preliminary  efficacy  of the PA intervention  in different  1018  
phenotypes  of asthma.   1019  
Actual data and i nformation connecting a study participant’s name and study identifying 1020  
number is kept in a locked file drawer in the PI’s office.  The coding system will be kept 1021  
in a locked cabinet or drawer separate from the actual data.  Research investigators 1022  
performing the statistical analyses data will not have access to information that can 1023  
connect up the actual identity of a study participant and their data.  All workstations 1024  
require the use of a passwo rd in order to gain access.  When leaving a workstation 1025  
unattended, the user must log -out or lock their computer.  Users are required to use 1026

 1029  
9.0 Data Analysis /Quality Control  1030  
 1031  
Aim 1: Focus Group Data Analysis /Quality Control  1032  
To ensure that the focus groups are responsive to the participants and unexpected 1033  
themes that might emerge, data analysis will begin after the first focus group data are 1034  
entered and continue throughout the focus group phase. Drs. Nyenhuis and Sharp will 1035  
review focus group transcriptions to identify recurring themes especially those focused 1036  
on barriers and enablers to PA/walking and explore the distribution across the groups 1037  
by key variables such as asthma severity and age.  In this manner, analysis will 1038  
consider the context of the responses including characteristics of the participants [5]. 1039  
The list of themes will serve as the data for th e intervention refinement, which will occur 1040  
as part of Aim 1b.  1041  
 1042  
The intent of Aim 1b is to integrate the barriers and facilitators to PA unique to 1043  
sedentary AA women with asthma obtained from Aim 1a to adapt a validated walking 1044  
intervention. A  multi -disciplinary asthma advisory team, consisting of kinesiologist - Dr. 1045  
Marquez, exercise -induced asthma specialist - Dr. Moy, PA in women specialist - Dr. 1046  
Wilbur and behavioral scientist - Dr. Sharp will meet to review the results and generate 1047  
independent suggestions  related to safe and effective PA with asthma and asthma - 1048  
related barriers and enablers to PA . This team will also address modifications specific to 1049  
asthma such as: 1) identification of asthma triggers (exercise, pollens, cold -air); 2) 1050  
adequate warm -up prio r to physical activity; 3) medication pre -treatment prior to 1051  
physical activity; 4) adequate cool -down after physical activity; 5) use of breathing 1052  
exercises. The group will review and rank order all suggestions for intervention 1053  
modifications. Final decisio ns will be determined by the Asthma Advisory Team: Drs. 1054  
Marquez, Sharp, Moy, Wilbur and Nyenhuis. The resulting intervention will be used in 1055  
Aim 2  (Pre-pilot) . 1056  
 1057  
Aim 2: Pre -pilot ACTION Intervention : The qualitative data collected during pre -pilot will 1058  
include but not be limited to, measures of time to administer and recruitment, 1059  
exploration of variance on measures (ceiling and floor effects), formative evaluations 1060  
from group sessions and issues with data collection and entry. The asthma advisory 1061  
team will r eview all aspects of the pre -pilot and recommend refine ment of  the content, 1062  
logistics, or process of the intervention. No further modifications will be made and we 1063  
will proceed to obtaining IRB approval for the final aim of the study (Aim 3).  1064  
 1065  
Aim 3: Pilot ACTION Intervention: The qualit ative data collected during pilot will include 1066  
but not be limited to, measures of time to administer and recruitment, exploration of 1067  
variance on measures (ceiling and floor effects), formative evaluations from group 1068  
sessions and issues with data collection and entry. The quantitative data collected will 1069  
include lung function, height/weight, body mass index, shuttle walk test time, 1070  
surveys /questionnaires , EMR data ( laboratory data, pulmonary function tests and sleep 1071  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 30 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] tests). This data will be stored in REDCap  and will be monitored period ically by the 1072  
study statistician.  1073  
  1074  
Aim 4:  Adapting Intervention tools:  Audio  recordings of the focus groups will be 1075  
transcribed and compared to field notes collected during the focus group meetings. An 1076  
initial list of codes will be used based upon the facilitator guides used in the focus 1077  
groups. The meeting transcript will be coded  independently by the PI and a research 1078  
assistant and will meet several times to group the codes into categories and add 1079  
definitions for each code so that the coding process is consistent. The list of themes will 1080  
serve as the data for the video refinement.  Data analysis strategies for demographic 1081  
data will use descriptive statistics.  1082  
 1083  
A multi -disciplinary research team, consisting of an asthma specialist - Dr. Nyenhuis, PA 1084  
in women specialist - Dr. Wilbur (mentor on Dr. Nyenhuis’ K award) and behavioral 1085  
scientist- Dr. Sharp (primary mentor on Dr. Nyenhuis’ K award) will meet to review the 1086  
results from the initial focus group meeting. The group will review and rank order all 1087  
suggestions for video modifications. Final decisions will be determined by Drs. 1088  
Nyenhu is, Wilbur and Sharp. The resulting suggestions of asthma content, setting and 1089  
language will be used to develop the script for the videos working with an experienced 1090  
videographer and filming will begin.  1091  
 1092  
The relevant raw video footage will be presented at  the second focus group meeting . 1093  
The women will be asked to provide feedback (written and oral) on the selection of 1094  
video scenes from the raw video footage clips that are relevant to the added asthma 1095  
video content. The written feedback includes a scoring s heet for each video. Each video 1096  
will be scored two times. Once for relevance of the asthma content to engaging in 1097  
physical activity and second for the usefulness in stimulating group discussion. Each 1098  
score will be on a 5 -point scale from not relevant to ve ry relevant or not useful to very 1099  
useful. Field notes will be taken during the meeting and the session will be audio 1100  
recorded and subsequently transcribed. The field notes and meeting transcript will be 1101  
reviewed by the PI and research assistant independent ly. The mean ratings of video 1102  
scenes’ relevance and usefulness will be calculated. The mean scores for eac h video 1103  
will be used as rationale for replacing unacceptable scores (<3) The suggestions for 1104  
scene inclusion will be reviewed and finalized with the m ulti-disciplinary research team 1105  
and reviewed with the videographer. The resulting video will be used in Aim 5.  1106  
 1107  
Aim 5: During the  third focus group the women will review the six edited videos and 1108  
provide feedback on the acceptability of the videos. Acceptability will be measured for 1109  
each video using a 4 -item summative evaluation using a 5 -point scale, which will 1110  
address overall sati sfaction, content and language used in each video. Open -ended 1111  
questions asked by the moderators will capture participants’ thoughts on what their likes 1112  
and dislikes about the videos. This session will be audiotaped and transcribed.  1113  
 1114  
The PI and RA will review the transcribed discussions and the mean scores from each 1115  
question on the questionnaire will be calculated.  1116

10.0 Data and Safety Monitoring  1120  
During this study, data and safety -monitoring will occur to to ensure the safety of study 1121  
participants and the validity of data in compliance with the National Institutes of Health 1122  
(NIH) requirement of Data and Safety Monitoring for Clinical Trials.  The Data and 1123  
Safety Monitoring for the proposed project has three  goals: (1) to insure the safety of 1124  
the participants; (2) to produce high  quality research while considering both risks and 1125  
benefits.   1126  
 1127  
This section outlines essential elements of the Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) for 1128  
this study .  1129  
a) Monitoring the Progre ss of the Trial and Safety of Participants: This study poses 1130  
minimal risk to the participants, as it involves getting the participant ’s opinions on 1131  
the use of behavioral counseling and low -impact exercise, walking. Drs. Sharp and 1132  
Nyenhuis will perform loca l monitoring of the progress of the trial and the safety of 1133  
participants.  1134  
 1135  
b) Plans for Assuring Compliance with Requirements Regarding the Reporting of 1136  
Adverse Events (AE):  1137  
Participants will be given the study office phone number (24 -hour coverage) to 1138  
conta ct study staff and/or investigators to report adverse events. All adverse events 1139  
will be reported to the IRB  and study sponsor (NIH) . 1140  
  1141  
Information about adverse events experienced by study  participants  will be 1142  
monitored by the following means:  1143  
• Report given by study participants  to study staff, either in person or by telephone.  1144  
• Report given to study staff by study participants’  family or friends, either in person 1145  
or by telephone.  1146  
• Report by the participant’s  physician or other health care provider involved in her 1147  
care.  1148  
• Report from a hospital or other healthcare facility where the study participant (s) is 1149  
being treated for the serious adverse event.  1150  
• Other persons who may have knowledge of such a serious adverse event.  1151  
 1152  
Upon receiving a  report of a serious adverse event:  1153  
• The study staff will contact Dr. Nyenhuis (at 312 -572-9179) or Dr. Sharp ( 312-355- 1154  
3569 ) as soon as possible.  1155  
• Drs. Nyenhuis or Sharp will complete the Adverse Event Report and submit the 1156  
completed form to the Human Subjects Committee of the University of Illinois at 1157  
Chicago and the NIH within 24 hours of learning of the adverse event.  1158  
• A copy of the adverse event form will be kept in the study file.  1159  
 1160  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________

Page 32 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] Drs. Nyenhuis and Sharp will assess recruitment flow, attendance,  retention rates, 1161  
and AE summaries weekly during team meetings. Data from the focus groups will 1162  
be recorded and transcribed by a member of the research team for review by Drs. 1163  
Nyenhuis  and Sharp. Procedures will be reviewed to insure that the data collected 1164  
are collected in a manner consistent with the confidentiality of the participants 1165  
involved.  1166  
 1167  
Monitoring the Progress of the Trial and the Safety of Participants .   1168  
Overall, the stud y poses minimal risk to participants.  A safety office will be named and 1169  
reports will be tendered every quarter to monitor progress and problems.  The report 1170  
provided to the safety office will including periodic assessments of data quality and 1171  
timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, 1172  
participant  complaints (if any), adverse events, and other factors that can affect study 1173  
outcomes.  Summaries of enrollment, attendance, and withdrawals will be reviewed.  If 1174  
we are not meeting our recruitment/retention goals we may consider the following 1175  
retention methods that have been used by other co -investigators in this patient 1176  
population such as: 1) Sending notes of appreciation, birthday cards or holiday cards; 2) 1177  
Small  tokens of appreciation. If a participant is unable to provide acceptable 1178  
accelerometer data (as described above) or is withdrawn from the study, a final letter 1179  
will be mailed to the participant (See Letter to participants that are withdrawn ). The 1180  
research  team will report any problems expressed by participants  to the PI either in 1181  
person or by telephone within 24 hours of the problem.  She will then pass this on to the 1182  
IRB and other appropriate oversight bodies.  1183  
 1184  
Reporting Adverse Events.   1185  
The safety offi cer will be immediately notified of any adverse events.  All adverse 1186  
events will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  1187  
 1188  
11.0 Statistical Considerations  1189  
Aim 1: Focus Groups  1190  
We will randomly select 160 women with the goal of recruiting a random samp le of 3 0 1191  
women. Participants will be selected to ensure representation of a range of variables 1192  
including asthma severity, current age and menopausal status . The sample size is 1193  
determined by the theoretical saturation or the point wh en no new ideas relevant to the 1194  
question are obtained, which is generally 1553. However, a minimum of 20 is 1195  
recommended for illness studies54. This study includes 30 participants in groups of 6 -10 1196  
for focus groups . If redundancy is not noted in the focus group discussion, additional 1197  
participants wil l be included until saturation is reached.   1198  
Qualitative analysis will occur after the focus groups. We will review focus group 1199  
transcriptions to identify recurring themes especially those focused on barriers and 1200  
enablers to PA/walking and explore the dist ribution across the groups by key variables 1201  
such as asthma severity and age.  1202

Page 33 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] Aim 2: Pre -pilot ACTION Intervention  1203  
One hundred  women  will be screened  and up to 10 women  will be selected  to 1204  
participate  in the pre-pilot.  Participants  will be selected  to ensure  representation  of a 1205  
range  of variables  including  asthma  severity,  current  age and menopausal  status.  As 1206  
the goal of this portion  of the study  is to test run the intervention  and inform  further  1207  
refinement  of the study  methods  no specific  sample  size calculations  were  performed.   1208  
 1209  
Aim 3: Pilot ACTION  intervention  1210  
Eight  hundred  women  will be screened  and up to 80 women  will be selected  to 1211  
participate  in the pilot.  Participants  will be selected  to ensure  representation  of a range  1212  
of variables  including  asthma  severity,  current  age and BMI. Participants  will be 1213  
randomized  using  REDCap  randomization  program.  As the goal of this portion  of the 1214  
study  is to test the feasibility,  acceptab ility and estimate  the efficacy  of the modified  1215  
intervention  thus no specific  sample  size calculations  were  performed.   1216  
 1217  
Aims  4 and 5: Adapting  Intervention  tools  1218  
We will recruit up to 15 AA women with asthma from our database of ~80 AA women 1219  
with asthma that have given us permission to contact them for research studies. These 1220  
women have already been identified as having asthma either through physician 1221  
diagnosis and/or the use of a  validated electronic health record (EH R) algorithm that 1222  
identifies asthma patients with a high sensitivity and specificity (99% and 96%, 1223  
respectively) [15, 16] . Potential participants will be contacted and asked screenin g 1224  
questions to ensure they are still in our target age range of 18 -70 years. Participants will 1225  
be selected to ensure representation of age ranges. The sample size is determined by 1226  
the theoretical saturation or the point when no new ideas relevant to the qu estion are 1227  
obtained, which is generally 15 [17].  1228  
 1229  
Qualitative analysis will occur after the focus groups. We will review focus group 1230  
transcr iptions to identify recurring themes especially those focused on video adaptation 1231  
and acceptability of the final product.  1232  
 1233  
Aim 6: Dissemination of study findings  1234  
As no data is collected there will be no statistical analysis performed.  1235  
 1236  
12.0 Regulatory Requirements  1237  
12.1 Informed Consent   1238  
As Aim s 1-3 of this research involves no greater than minimal risk, we will obtain 1239  
eligibility and interest in participation over the phone or in person. All participants that 1240  
attend the focus group will provide written informed consent will be obtained prior to 1241  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 34 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] starting the focus group. All participants involved in Aims 2 and 3 of the i ntervention will 1242  
provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures taking place.  1243  
 1244  
Informed consent will be obtain ed by key research personnel that have completed 1245  
training in human subjects research and obtaining informed consent.  1246  
 1247  
We request a HIPAA Preparatory to Research, a waiver of informed consent for the 1248  
identification of potential participants  in the recruitment phase of research .  1249  
 1250  
This request is based on the following criteria that we will follow:  1251  
 1252  
a. Use is sought solely to review p rotected health information as necessary to 1253  
perform the asthma algorithm in the UI Health E HR. prepare a research protocol 1254  
or for similar purposes preparatory to research (in this case identify participants  1255  
for recruitment);  1256  
 1257  
b. No protected health informa tion is to be removed from the covered entity by the 1258  
researcher in the course of the review and PHI will not be retained long term if 1259  
patient  decide not to participate; and  1260  
 1261  
c. The protected health information for which use or access is sought is necessary  1262  
for the research purposes.  1263  
 1264  
The following criteria for the waiver of informed consent for the identification of potential 1265  
participants  in the recruitment phase of the research will be  met: 1266  
 1267  
a. The recruitment phase of the research involves no more than minimal risk to the 1268  
participants ; 1269  
b. The waiver of informed consent for the identification of potential participants  in the 1270  
recruitment phase of the research will not adversely affect the rights a nd welfare 1271  
of the participants ; 1272  
c. The recruitment phase of the research could not practicably be carried out without 1273  
the waiver of informed consent for the identification of potential participants  in the 1274  
recruitment phase of the research; and  1275  
d. If approp riate, the participants  will be provided with additional pertinent 1276  
information after the recruitment phase of the research.  1277  
 1278  
A waiver of documentation and an alteration of consent is requested for the eligibility 1279  
screening portion of the study.  1280

Page 35 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] 12.2 Subject Confidentiality  1281  
Each participant will be given information about the purpose of the study  and will 1282  
participate only after having signed the informed consent.  Confidentiality will be 1283  
maintained by keeping research records in locked file drawers an d all data will be 1284  
maintained on a secured network maintained in the Department of Medicine.  We will 1285  
use identification numbers to insure confidentiality of the data files.  Once collected, an 1286  
individual’s data will not be available to anyone other than a n authorized person on the 1287  
proposed project.  1288  
 1289  
Participants will receive a thorough introduction to the study preparing them for the 1290  
nature of the questions that will be asked in the focus group.  Such preparation often 1291  
decreases the risk for becoming undul y distressed.  If a participant does become 1292  
distressed, study staff will be trained to respond in a supportive, empathic way and to 1293  
give the participant  the opportunity to take a break.  1294  
 1295  
Formal training on data and participant safety is provided to all re search staff involved in 1296  
the data collection process.  All staff and students involved in our research studies sign 1297  
a confidentiality agreement stating that they are aware that any data they come in 1298  
contact with is strictly confidential and is not to be di scussed outside of the research 1299  
project.  They also complete the University of Illinois at Chicago online training on 1300  
Human Subjects Protection (101) and the HIPAA Privacy Act.  1301  
 1302  
12.3 Unanticipated Problems  1303  
Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants  or others (including adverse 1304  
events), will be reported to the UIC IRB and study sponsor (NIH) in a timely manner.  1305

1.0 Background   
 
1.1 Thyroid Cancer – Incidence and Standard of Care  
 
More than 500,000 people in the United States have a diagnosis of thyroid cancer, and 
the incidence is steadily growing, with an estimated 62,000 new cases in 2014.  Thyroid cancer is the 5
th most commonly diagnosed cancer in women.  Although localized 
differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is generally managed by surgery and radioactive iodine therapy, approximately 10% of patients develop progressive invasive primary 
disease and 5% develop distant metastases (Howlader N, et. al., 2010)
1.  Many of these 
patients develop radioiodine -refractory disease, and their prognosis is only minimally 
improved with tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (TKIs) .  Treatment with sorafenib does provide 
some benefit, with an overall partial response (PR) rate of 12% and a 5- month increase in 
progression- free survival (PFS) .  However, no complete response (CR) is observed and 
the partial responses are not durable  (Brose  MS, et. al., 2014)2.  Lenvatinib , which is now 
approved as standard of care for progressive DTC,  achieved  a 1.5% CR and a 63.2 % PR 
and extended PFS by 14.7 months  (Schlumberger  M, et. al., 2015)3.  While these data are 
encouraging, TKI monotherapies are not curative .   
 
1.2 Rationale for Immune-based Therapies in Aggressive DTC 
 
The thyroid is one of the most immunogenic organs in the body.  The prevalence of 
autoimmune thyroiditis in the general population is approximately 5- 10%, and nearly 
30% of patients with DTC have thyroid autoantibodies.  Furthermore, checkpoint 
blockade therapies (i.e., anti- CTLA -4 and anti- PD-1) commonly lead to thyroiditis.  As in 
other inflammation -associated cancers, thyroiditis may contribute to tumorigenesis, 
tumor elimination, and, at later stages, tumor progression.  It is likely that a subset of the 
autoimmune T cell response is capable of recognizing the thyroid tumor in many patients with DTC.   
 A growing body of literature has described the tumor -associated immune response in 
thyroid cancers  (French  JD, 2013)
4.  Similar to other types  of cancer, the immune milieu 
in thyroid cancer includes immature dendritic cells, M2- polarized macrophages, and 
suppressive or dysfunctional T cells.  Despite these classic signs of immune 
dysregulation, most patients with thyroid cancer have relatively i ndolent disease.  
Patients with invasive primary disease progress slowly compared to other types of inoperable cancers, with an average survival rate of 70% at 5 years.   Lymph node (LN) 
metastasis, while common in patients with DTC, rarely lead to distant metastasis and can 
persist for years without evident progression.  Given the potential immunogenicity and 
relatively indolent nature of DTC, we hypothesize that DTC may be exceptionally 
sensitive to immune -targeted therapies.  
 
1.3 Tregs and T Cell Exhaustion in DTC 
 
Our previous  (French JD, Kotnis GR, et. al., 2012 and French JD, Weber ZJ, et. al., 
2010)5, 6 and ongoing studies suggest that T cell dysfunction plays a role in DTC 
progression.  Specifically, FoxP3+ regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) were found at 
increased frequencies in both primary tumors (T1 -T4) and tumor -involved lymph nodes  
(TILN) compared to blood and uninvolved lymph nodes (UILN), respectively.  Treg frequency in primary tumors correlated with lymph node metastasis, and increased levels of Tregs were found in TILN from patients with recurrent disease.  Programmed -death -1 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 6  Addendum 6 
 
(PD-1)+ T cells were also enriched in primary tumors (T1 -T4) and TILN. Although we 
have not yet  shown disease significance in primary tumors, high frequencies of PD -1+ T 
cells in TILN were associated with extranodal invasion, a sign of more aggressive 
disease.  Ongoing studies using archived tissues from patients with inoperable, invasive 
T4 tumors and distant metastases revealed intratumoral CD8+ T cells and FoxP3+ Tregs 
in 14 of 15 primary T4 tumors and 1 of 4 metastases tested to date. PD -1+ T cells were 
present in peritumoral and more distal regions in a subset of patients (n= 6). PD -L1 was 
expressed by the primary tumor and infiltrating leukocytes in 8 (53 %) of 15 samples 
tested, respectively. Furthermore, preliminary studies in progressive DTC suggest that Tregs (9 -14%) and PD -1
+CD8+ (27- 46%) T cell frequencies are elevated in peripheral 
blood in a subset of patients.   
   
To further investigate the phenotype and functional capacity of PD -1+ T cells in DTC, we 
isolated tumor -associated lymphocytes from grossly -involved lymph nodes  (Severson JJ, 
et. al., 2015)7.  PD -1+CD8+ T cells were enriched (5 -38% of CD8+) in 7 of 11 of TILNs 
and displayed an exhausted molecular phenotype (i.e., CD69hi, CD127+/-, CD27hi).  T cell 
immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein 3 (Tim -3) was co -expressed with PD -1.  Ex 
vivo functional studies of CD8+ T cells revealed that stimulated cytokine (IL -2, TNFα, 
and IFNγ) production was diminished to varying degrees. However, ex vivo  proliferative 
potential remained largely intact.  Thus, PD -1 expression is a sign of T cell dysfunction 
in patients with persistent lymph node involvement.  However, exhaustion may be in the early stages and readily reversible.  Analysis of PD -L1 expression o n fresh tumor 
samples from TILN revealed that the majority of tumors (8/11) express PD -L1 and may 
contribute directly to PD -1-mediated T cell dysfunction.  In line with our previous 
studies, Tregs were elevated (13 -39% of CD4
+) in TILN from all 11 patients , regardless 
of PD -1 phenotype.  We predict that Tregs may contribute to the development of T cell 
exhaustion; and, even in the absence of exhaustion, may pose a substantial barrier to the 
success of immune- targeted and tumor -targeted therapies.  
 
1.4 Antia ngiogenic Therapy 
 
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from a preexisting vascular network, is 
essential for tumor growth and metastasis. Many molecules have been implicated as  
positive regulators of angiogenesis, including VEGF, acidic fibroblast growth factor 
(aFGF), basic FGF (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interleukin (IL) -8, and 
platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF).  (Kobayashi M, et. al., 2013)19 In adults , 
physiological angiogenesis occurs during the female reproductive cycle and in wound healing. In addition to tumor growth, abnormally enhanced neovascularization is also observed in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and diabetic retinopathy. Of the numerous 
molecules that have been shown to have angiogenic properties, VEGF has been identified 
as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis with increased 
expression being associated with a poor prognosis in many human tumor types. (Rizvi 
NA, et. al., 2015, Taube JM, et. al., 2014, Tumeh PC, et. al., 2014, Qing W, et. al., 2012) 
21-24 VEGF acts primarily on endothelial cells to promote their proliferation and three -
dimensional organization for tube formation and is thought to be the most potent and 
specifi c proangiogenic factor. VEGF  exerts its effects through two cell membrane bound 
receptors, Flt -1 and KDR, of which KDR is thought to be more important. There is 
increasing evidence that KDR is the major mediator of endothelial cell proliferation and 
surviv al as well as tube formation and microvascular  permeability. KDR undergoes 
dimerization and ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, producing a mitogenic,  
 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 7  Addendum 6 
 
chemotactic and prosurvival signal. Consequently, a KDR TK inhibitor  would be 
expected to exert a potent inhibitory effect on tumor growth and metastasis formation. 
 
1.5 Pembrolizumab Mechanism of Action  
  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis 
in various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of 
CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulator y T-cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long- term survival in many solid tumors.  
 The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell su rface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or 
PD-L2).  The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved.  PD -1 and family members are 
type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, 
PD-1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its 
cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ,  
PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade.  The 
mechanism by which PD -1 down modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but distinct 
from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins.  
PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ 
and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells.  Expression has also been 
shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as 
subsets of m acrophages and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) 
are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both ligands are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular 
region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -1 ligand to PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T- cell receptor.  
PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various non- hematopoietic tissues, most notably on 
vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  
 
PD-L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -
L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy 
organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express 
abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -
specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD -
1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered 
as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
 
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475, Keytruda
TM) is a potent and highly selective humanized 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 8  Addendum 6 
 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD-L2.   
 
Clinical Experience with Pembrolizumab  
 Melanoma: Pembrolizumab has recently been approved in the United Stated for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  Approval was based on 
the results of a multicenter, open- label, randomized trial, P001. 173 patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression on ipilimumab and, if 
BRAF V600 mutation positive, prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, were randomized 
to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg  (n=89) or 10 mg/kg (n=84) intravenously once every 
3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
  
Key exclusion criteria were an autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required 
immunosuppression, and/or a history of severe immune-medi ated adverse reactions from 
treatment with ipilimumab.  Severe immune- mediated adverse reactions were defined as 
any CTCAE Grade 4 toxicity requiring treatment with corticosteroids or Grade 3 toxicity 
requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/ day prednisone or equivalent dose) 
for greater than 12 weeks. 
  
The ORR was 24% (95% CI: 15, 34) in the 2 mg/kg arm, consisting of one complete 
response and 20 partial responses.  Among the 21 patients with an objective response, 3 
(14%) had disease progression at 2.8, 2.9, and 8.2 months after initial response. The remaining 18 patients (86%) have ongoing responses, ranging from 1.4+ to 8.5+ 
months;  8 patients have ongoing responses of 6 months or longer.  Similar ORR results 
were observed in the 10 mg/kg arm.   
  
The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions among patients receiving pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks were fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, 
rash, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.  
  
The most frequent (greater than or equal to 2%) serious adverse drug reactions observed 
with pembrolizumab were renal failure, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cellulitis.  Additional clinically significant immune -mediated adverse reactions included pneumonitis, colitis, 
hypophysitis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, nephritis, and hepatitis. 
 
Pembrolizumab is now being studied extensively in multiple cancer types, and in combination multiple antineoplastic agents.   
Lung Cancer : The safety of pembrolizumab  was studied in 550 patients with advanced 
NSCLC. The most common side effects of pembrolizumab included fatigue, decreased 
appetite, shortness of breath or impaired breathing (dyspnea) and cough. Pembrolizumab  
also has the potential to cause severe side ef fects that result from the immune system 
effect of pembrolizumab  (known as “immune- mediated side effects”).  
 
The effectiveness of pembrolizumab  for this use was demonstrated in a subgroup of 61 
patients enrolled within a larger multicenter, open- label, mu lti-part study. The subgroup 
consisted of patients with advanced NSCLC that progressed following platinum -based 
chemotherapy or, if appropriate, targeted therapy for certain genetic mutations (ALK or EGFR). This subgroup also had PD -L1 positive tumors based on the results of the 22C3 
pharmDx diagnostic test. Study participants received 10 mg/kg of pembrolizumab every 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 9  Addendum 6 
 
two or three weeks. The major outcome measure was overall response rate (percentage of 
patients who experienced complete and partial shrinkage of their tumors). Tumors shrank 
in 41 percent of patients treated with pembrolizumab  and the effect lasted between 2.1 
and 9.1 months.                                                                                                           
 
In the 550 study participants with advanced NSCLC, severe immune -mediated side 
effects occurred involving the lungs, colon and hormone -producing glands. Other 
uncommon immune -mediated side effects were rash and inflammation of blood vessels 
(vasculitis). Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take pembrolizumab 
because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Across clinical 
studies, a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system (Guillain -Barre Syn drome) also occurred.  
 The FDA granted pembrolizumab breakthrough therapy designation for this indication 
because Merck demonstrated through preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over available therapies. The drug also received priority 
review status, which is granted to drugs that, at the time the application was submitted, 
have the potential to be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment of a serious condition. 
 
Thyroid Cancer:   There is an ongoing basket trial (
KEYNOTE -028 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ) 
which has enrolled  patients with advanced thyroid cancer to a single agent 
pembrolizumab (200 mg iv every 3 weeks) study.  Preliminary data from the thyroid 
cohort in this trial was presented at the 2016 American Society for Clinical Oncology 
(Mehnert JM, et al, J Clin Oncol 34, 2016 (suppl; abstr 6091) ).  The study enrolled 22 
patients with DTC, with a median duration of follow -up of 74 weeks (29- 87 weeks).  No 
patients achieved a CR (0%) and 2 patients had a PR (9.1%), with 12 achieved SD (54%). 
 
1.6 Lenvatinib Mechanism o f Action  
 
VEGF is a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. Its 
increased expression is associated with a poor prognosis in many cancers. VEGF exerts 
its effects through two cell membrane receptors, fms -like tyrosine kinase 1/vas cular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (Flt -1/VEGFR -1) and kinase insert domain receptor 
(KDR/VEGFR -2). (Kobayashi M, et. al, 2013)19  Lenvatinib is an orally available potent 
inhibitor of the split -kinase family of transmembrane growth factor receptor s including 
Flt-1/VEGFR -1 and KDR/VEGFR -2. Receptor tyrosine kinase cell free assays  
demonstrate IC50 values of 22 (Flt -1/VEGFR -1) and 4 nM (KDR/VEGFR -2). 
Additionally, lenvatinib potently inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR -3, IC 50 5nM), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) -1 (IC50 46 nM),2,3,4 
and platelet -derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR, IC50 39 nM) beta tyrosine kinases. 
Lenvatinib also inhibits (IC50 5.2 nM) SCF -driven tube formation of HUVEC, which 
express SCF recep tor, KIT.  
  
 
Clinical Experience with Lenvatinib  
 A global Phase 1 program in patients with solid tumors has been conducted with 
lenvatinib to determine the  safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of three different 
regimens including continuous once daily dosing. Pharmacokinetic analysis has 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 10  Addendum 6 
 
demonstrated that lenvatinib is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations observed 
from 1 to 3 hours post  dose. Lenvatinib elimination occurs with a biexponential decline 
composed of an initial rapid decline followed by a slower decline. The terminal half -life 
is approximately 30 hours and steady state is achieved within 5 days. A dose dependent 
increase in soluble VEGF, consistent with an anti -angiogenic effect was observed during 
2 weeks of continuous dosing. 
 
Hypertension and proteinuria were the most common dose limiting toxicities (DLT). A 
dose of  25 mg once daily was found to be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) f or the 
once daily continuous dosing schedule. A cohort of 24 patients treated at this dose level 
established the  safety and tolerability of the lenvatinib 25 mg dose for once daily 
continuous dosing. To simplify drug administration, a dose of 24 mg (two 10 mg capsules 
+ one 4 mg capsule) once daily was selected for ongoing lenvatinib development.  
Lenvatinib - Clinical Experience in Thyroid Cancer 
 
Phase II study of lenvatinib in radioiodine -refractory DTC led to the SELECT  trial, a 
global, placebo-controll ed randomized phase III trial of lenvatinib in radioiodine -
refractory progressive DTC. The primary endpoint was PFS, which was significantly 
prolonged with lenvatinib versus placebo (median 18.3 months versus 3.6 months, 
respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.2 1; 99% confidence interval 0.14–0.31, P<0.001). 
Lenvatinib PFS benefit was observed in all predefined subgroups, including patients who received 0 (n=299) or 1 (n=93) prior tyrosine -kinase inhibitor therapies (HR: 0.20 and 
0.22, respectively). Lenvatinib significantly improved ORR versus placebo (64.8% [4 
complete; 165 partial responses] versus 1.5%; P<0.001). Median overall survival has not 
been reached. For lenvatinib, treatment -related adverse effects (>40%, all grades) were 
hypertension (67.8%), diarrhea (59.4%), fatigue/asthenia (59.0%), de creased appetite 
(50.2%), decreased weight (46.4%), and nausea (41.0%); adverse effects were managed 
with dose reductions and standard interventions. Discontinuations due to adverse effects 
occurred in 37 (14.2%) lenvatinib- treated and 3 (2.3%) placebo- treated patients. In the 
lenvatinib arm, 6/20 treatment -emergent deaths were considered drug -related.  
 
1.7  Rationale for Combination Therapy with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Lenvatinib 
 
We predict that successful elimination of aggressive DTC will require b oth cessation of 
tumor growth and activation of the anti- tumor immune response.  
 Based on preliminary data, we predict that release of the PD -1 checkpoint and 
simulanteous elimination of Treg suppressive activity will be essential for immune 
activation in patients with advanced DTC.  Disruption of PD -1/PD -L1 interactions with 
MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) would release a major checkpoint blockade in patients with 
PD-1+ tumor -specific T cells, encouraging immune- mediated tumor destruction.  
Importantly, Tregs have  been shown to express both PD -1 and PD -L1, and blockade of 
PD-1/PD -L1 interactions is thought to inhibit the induction, maintenance, and function of 
Tregs . (Amarnath S, et. al, 2011, Duraiswamy J, et. al., 2013, Francisco LM, et. al., 2009, 
Kitazawa Y, et . al., 2007)
8-11  Thus, pembrolizumab may also inhibit the suppressive 
effects of tumor -associated Tregs.  
 A number of studies have investigated the effects of multi -target tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors on the immune system. Sorafenib was initially developed to target RAF, but it 
also inhibits VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3, PDGFR -β, c-kit and FLT3  (Adnane L, et. al., 2006, 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 11  Addendum 6 
 
and Ahmad T, et. al., 2004) 12, 13.  Of note, Tregs are known to express VEGFR -214. 
Inhibition of VEGF activity by anti -VEGFR -2 antibody treatm ent inhibits Treg 
proliferation (Terme M, et. al., 2013) 14.  Sorafenib inhibited Treg suppression in vitro  
(Busse A, et. al., 2011 and Cabrera R, et. al., 2013)15, 16 and reduced the number of 
peripheral Tregs in cancer patients in 2 of 3 independent studi es (Chen ML, et. al., 2014, 
Florcken A, et. al., 2012 and Kobayashi M, et. al., 2013) 17-19.  We believe that 
lenvatinib may have a more potent effect on Treg function in patients with advanced thyroid cancer based on its more potent effects on VEGFR -2. 
 We hypothesize that combination pembrolizumab and lenvatinib therapy will generate 
significantly improved CR compared to pembrolizumab alone  (MK3475-
028/KEYNOTE -28, ongoing basket  trial that includes DTC , that demonstrated a CR of 
0%) or the historical CR of lenvatinib alone (1.5%).  
  1.8  Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/ Modification  
 An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) was conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated 
and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This firs t in human study of MK -3475 
showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, was  the dose and schedule 
utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose 
of MK -3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and 
clinical activity.  
 
PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) sug gested that peripheral target engagement 
is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concent ration 
time data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of MK -3475 were found to be dependent on body weight. The 
relationship between clearance and body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is 
within the range observed for other antibodies and would support both body weight 
normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights.  MK -3475 has been found to 
have a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based 
regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 
5.0 for MK -3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the 
notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed 
dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK 
evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 12  Addendum 6 
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab 
in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed 
at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response 
relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 
mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on 
distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by the population PK model) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary 
meani ngfully with tumor type.  
 The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is 
based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are 
optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will 
maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as 
associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain  individual patients 
exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
 
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also 
reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
 The starting dose of lenvatinib 24 mg by mouth daily is the FDA -approved dose for 
radioiodine- refra ctory progressive differentiated thyroid carcinoma based upon the 
dosing used in the phase III SELECT trial that established the efficacy of lenvatinib in this setting.  An ongoing phase Ib basket trial of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in solid 
tumors (thyroid was not included), showed good tolerability of the combination and recommends a starting dose of 20 mg daily lenvatinib in combination with 200 mg iv 
pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, which will be the staring doses in Cohort 1 (personal communication). Patients entering Cohort 2 will have progressed on lenvatinib. These 
patients will remain on the dose they are taking at the time of study entry, which may have been previously reduced for side effect management, and will not exceed 20 mg by 
mouth daily.  
 1.9 Rationale for Correlative Research  
 
1.91 Recent successes of anti -PD-1/PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., 
pembrolizumab, and nivolumab)  have reinvigorated the field of cancer 
immunotherapy (Hamid O, et. al., 2013 and Rizvi NA, et. al., 2015)
20, 21. 
Response rates have ranged from 13% to 37% in patients with progressive 
cancers that have failed multiple lines of therapy.  Post -trial analyses have 
attempted to define molecular markers that correlate with tumor regression.  Response to nivolumab was associated most strongly with expression of PD -L1 
by the tumor and did not significantly correlate with infiltratin g lymphocytes.  
PD-1 was expressed by tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in 7/10 of responders and 
9/18 non- responders and did not significantly correlate with a clinical response  
(Taube JM et. al., 2014)
22.  In contrast, response to pembrolizumab was strongly 
associated with a high frequency of CD8+ or PD -1+ T cells, either at the invasive 
margin or infiltrating the tumor, and, to a lesser degree, expression of PD -L1 
(Tumeh PC, et. al., 2014)23.  In the proposed correlative research studies, we will 
assess CD8+ and PD -1+ T cell frequency and expression of PD -L1 and PD -L2 by 
tumor and associated leukocytes in primary tumor samples and pre -treatment 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 13  Addendum 6 
 
biopsies by immunohistochemistry. We will also assess PD -1 expression and its 
functional consequences in peripheral  blood leukocytes before and throughout 
treatment using flow cytometry.  
 
1.92 Tregs have been shown to express both PD -1 and PD -L1, and blockade of PD -
1/PD -L1 interactions is thought to inhibit the induction, maintenance, and 
function of Tregs  (Duraiswamy  J, et. al., 2013)9, 11. A number of studies have 
investigated the effects of multi -target t yrosine kinase inhibitors on the immune 
system. Inhibition of VEGF activity by anti -VEGFR -2 antibody treatment 
inhibits Treg proliferation (Terme M, et. al., 2013)14.  Sorafenib, a multikinase 
inhibitor that targets VEGFR -2, has been shown to inhibit Treg suppression in 
vitro  and reduce the number of peripheral Tregs in cancer patients (Busse A, et. 
al., 2011 and Cabrera R, et. al., 2013)15, 16. Thus, both pembrolizumab and 
lenvatinib may inhibit the suppressive effects of tumor- associated Tregs. We plan 
to investigate whether the frequency of FoxP3+ Tregs in the primary tumor and 
pre-treatment biopsy, as determined by immunohistochemistry for FoxP3, 
correlates with response to treatment. We will also investigate the frequency and 
phenotype of Tregs in peripheral blood before and throughout treatment using flow cytometry.  
 1.93 Tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and immature dendritic cells (iDC) h ave 
been described in primary thyroid tumors. Increased frequencies of TAM were associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with DTC  (Qing W, et. al., 
2012)
24. TAM in DTC expressed CD163 and IL -10 and have been proposed to 
play a role in tumor progression  (Qing W, et. al., 2012)24. CD1a+ iDCs were also 
found at high frequencies in DTC samples  (Batistatou A, et. al, 2002, Ugolini C, 
et. al. 200 7, and Scarpino S, et. al., 2000)25-27. We identified PD -L1+ TAM in 
12/15 pT4 DTC and PDTC samples. Pro -angiogenic VEGFA is well documented 
in its ability to inhibit DC maturation and support the generation of TAM and 
myeloid derived suppressor c ells (MDSC)  (Alfaro C, et. al., 2009, Almand B., et. 
al., 2000, Dikov MM, et. al., 2005, Gabrilovich D, et. al., 1998, Voron T, et. al., 2014)
28-32. This immunosuppressive cellular network likely supports induction 
and maintenance of Tregs within the tumor microenvironment through 
production of IL -10 and TGFβ  (Coffelt SB, et. al., 2011, Ghiringhelli F, et. al., 
2005, and Huang B, et. al., 2006)33-35. We plan to investigate the frequency and 
phenotype of TAM and MDSC in tumor and blood samples, respectively. 
 1.94 Approximatel y 25% of patients with DTC produce thyroid- specific antibodies, 
most commonly against Tg and TPO  (Fiore E, et. al., 2009 and Pacini F, et. al., 
1988)
36, 37. We predict that titers of these autoantibodies may be surrogate 
markers for the anti -tumor response with pembrolizumab and lenvatinib therapy.  
 1.95 Recent analyses of patients with melanoma that underwent treatment with anti -
PD-1 (pembrolizumab, Merck) revealed a strong positive association between the 
number of mutations in the tumor and responsiveness to the checkpoint blockade therapy (Rizvi NA , et. al., 2015)
38. While thyroid cancer, in general, is thought to 
be a have a low mutation burden, little is known about mutation frequency and 
antigenicity in more aggressive and metastatic cases. Here, we propose to 
investigate whether high frequency of mutations or type of mutation is associated 
with response to combination therapy.  
 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 14  Addendum 6 
 
1.96 It is likely that a subset of patients will not respond to treatment and will require 
alternative therapies. Numerous tumor -intrinsic and tumor -extrinsic factors will 
undoubtedly contribute to resistance (e.g., mutation load, MHCI expression, antigen presentation, immune suppressive factors).  We plan to compare gene 
expression profiles by RNA -Seq from responders and non- responders using pre -
treatment frozen and FFPE biopsy samples. 
 
2.0 Goals    
 
2.1 Primary  
 
2.11 To investigate the clinical efficacy , as indicated by the rate of complete response 
(CR)  per RECIST 1.1 , of combination therapy with pembrolizumab and 
lenvatinib in lenvatinib -naïve patients with progressive radioiodine- refractory 
DTC  (Cohort 1). 
 2.12   To determine the overall response rate (ORR) by the addition of pembrolizumab 
to patients with radioiodine -refractory DTC who have progressive disease on 
lenvatinib alone (Cohort 2). 
 
2.2 Secondary  
 
2.21 To determine the safety profile and toxicity of combination therapy with 
pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with progressive DTC.  (Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2)  
 
2.22 To determine progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  (Cohort 
1 and Cohort 2) 
 
2.3 Correlative Research    
 
2.31 T o correlate t umor response (RECIST 1.1) with pretreatment frequency  of CD8+ 
T cells in the primary and/or metastatic tumor.  FFPE t umor  samples  will be 
evaluated for CD8+ T cells by immunohistochemistry.  Staining intensity is 
scored on a 1
+ to 3+ scale, and the percentage of positive cells per total 
lymphocytes is estimated (1 = <1%, 2 = 1- 10%, 3 = 11- 33%, 4 = 34- 66%, 5 = 
67-100%). Allred scores (intensity + percent positive) are generated for 
comparison between samples (Phillips T,  et. al., 2007) . Quanti tation of the CD8+ 
cells will be performed using the Aperio Scanscope AT2 system (20X, 0.5 
μm/pixel resolution). Our collaborating pathologist will designate both 
peritumoral and intratumoral areas for differential quantitation using the Aperio 
ImageScope application, and annotated regions will be analyzed for positive 
staining using an Aperio colormetric thresholding algorithm. To extrapolate the 
number of positive cells per mm2, 15 random cells will be chosen to determine 
the average pixels per positive CD8 event. The average number of CD8 pixels 
will be divided by the total positive pixels to determine the number of positive 
CD8 cells in the annotated regions. The number of CD8 cells divided by the area 
will estimate the number of positive cells per mm2.  (Cohort 1 and 2) 
 
2.32 To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with pretreatment PD -L1 and PD -L2 
levels in the primary and/or metastatic tumor.  Tumors will be will be evaluated 
for PD-L1 (by QualTek Clinical Laboratories) and  anti-PD-L2 (Biolegend 
MIH1 8) by immunohistochemistry, as described above.  (Cohort 1 and 2) 
 2.33 To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with pretreatment frequency of 
lymphocytes expressing  CD3, CD4, PD -1, FoxP3, or CD20, and of CD163+ 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504 15  Addendum 6 
 
macrophages.  Cells types will be detected in pretreatment FFPE tumor tissue by 
immunohistochemistry .  (Cohort 1 and 2) 
 
2.34 To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with the phenotype and frequency of 
key leukocyte subsets (i.e., PD -1+ T cells, Tregs, myeloid subsets) in the 
peripheral blood before, at  6 and 18 weeks  on therapy, and at 54 weeks (study 
completion), PD, or study withdrawal.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cell s and 
neutrophils will be  isolated concomitantly by density gradient from peripheral 
blood, cryopreserved, and analyzed by 10- color flow cytometry .  (Cohort 1)  
 
2.35 To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with PD -1+ T cell functional 
capacity.  Stimulated cytokine assays will be performed on lymphocyte 
populations isolated from peripheral blood, as described in 2.34.  Briefly, cells 
will be stimulated with PMA/ionomycin or plate -bound anti -CD3 plus soluble 
anti-CD28 for 6 hours in the presence of brefeldin A  and intracellular expression 
levels of IL -2, IFNγ, and TNFα  will be determined by flow cytometry .  Normal 
peripheral blood will be used as a control for optimal cytokine produ ction. 
Patient T cell function will be compared before and after treatment.   (Cohort 1) 
 2.36 To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with  serum anti -thyroglobulin 
antibody levels assessed before, and at 18 weeks  on therapy .  (Cohort 1 and 2) 
 2.37 To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with tumor mutation status.  Tumor 
mutation analysis will be performed by whole exome sequencing with DNA 
isolated from  pre- treatment frozen biopsies and FFPE archival  primary tumor  for 
each patient where available,  using patient -matched blood as a baseline control.  
(Cohort 1) 
 2.38 To broadly investigate mechanisms of response and resistance to combination 
therapy, gene expression profiles will be generated from frozen biopsies for analysis by RNA -Seq. Total RNA will be isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) 
and 500ng of RNA will be s ubmitted mRNA -seq library construction (TruSeq 
Stranded mRNA Library Kit, Illumina). In parallel, FFPE primary tumor samples 
will be analyzed by RNA -Seq (Graw S, et. al., 2015)

with Cycles  11, 15 and 19 (day 1)for up to 54 weeks for all patients. For those patients who continue treatment beyond 54 weeks (up to 
an additional 12 months), continue checking TSH and free T4 on cycle 23, 27, 31 and 35. For those patients who do NOT have anti-
thyroglobulin antibodies, check thyroglobulin at baseline, and then same time points as TSH and free T4.  
5 Imaging is  to be  performed  day 1 for Cycles 3, 5, and 7, then every 4th cycle for Cycles 11, 15, and 19, up to 54 weeks. Scans can be 
done sooner than 18 weeks if clinically indicated. (See Section 13 for further  details.) For those patients who continue treatment 
beyond 54 weeks (up to an additional 12 months), imaging should be done on Cycle 23, 27, 31 and 35. CT or MRI scans of the neck, 
chest, abdomen and pelvis, as determined by the investigator to assess response per RECIST v1.1. Imaging with IV contrast is 
encouraged but will be done per investigator’s discretion. If the abdom en-pelvic CT is negative at baseline, subsequent imaging of this 
site is required only if clinically indicated during the study period . NOTE: Use same imaging throughout the study as much as possible. 
PET scans are performed only as clinically indicated at pre- study, and for restaging as determined per investigator’s discretion. For 
those patients who have initial progression (PD)  in the fi rst 12 weeks post -registration , a confirmation scan will be required 4 weeks 
later to confirm PD. See 13.6 for further details. If progression is confirmed then the date of disease progression will be the first date 
the patient met the criteria f or progression based on standard RECIST 1.1 criteria.

7.11 Cohort 1: Lenvatinib -naïve patients will be administered both study drugs 
(pembrolizumab and lenvatinib) as of Cycle 1 Day 1. Each cycle is 21 days. The 
starting dose of oral lenvatinib is 20 mg (two 10- mg capsules).  
 
7.12 Cohort 2:  Pembrolizumab will be added to the treatment for patients who experience PD 
on lenvatinib alone. They will remain on or resume the dose of lenvatinib on which they 
experienced PD . Cycle 1 Day  1 will be the first day pembrolizumab is added to the treatment.   
Patients who have temporarily stopped lenvatinib dosing within 30 days of enrollment will restart 
lenvatinib at their prior dose along with pembrolizumab on Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment.  
Patients entering Cohort 2 will have progressed on lenvatinib. These  patients will remain on the 
dose they are taking at the time of study entry, which may have been previously reduced for side effect management, and will not exceed 20 mg by mouth daily. 
 
 
7.2 Patients will  be instructed on lenvatinib administration , to be taken  with water orally once 
a day (with or without food) at approximately the same time each day, and granted 
treatment independence with nursing staff approval. If a  patient misses a dose , and cannot 
be taken within 12 hours, then t hat dose should be omitted and the next dose should be 
taken a t the usual time of administration. If a patient  vomit s after taking the daily dose of 
lenvatinib, DO NOT repeat dosing. Resume regular dosing the  next day.  NOTE: The 
patient will be requested to maintain a medication diary to document time and date when 
each dose of lenvatinib  is taken. Patient will also document number of pills/dose of 
medication taken , and note any vomiting subsequent to dosing. The medicat ion diary will 
be returned to clinic staff at each  examination visit (see Section 4.0). 
 
7.3 Pembrolizumab, 200 mg, will be administered as a 30- minute IV infusion every 21 days 
(treatment cycle intervals may be increased based on toxicities as described in section 
8.3). Sites should target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible, however, 
given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 and +10 minutes 
is permitted (i.e., infusions lasting between 25 minutes to 40 minutes are acceptable).  
 7.4 Study treatment with pembrolizumab may be administered up to 3 days before or after 
the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons. 
  
7.5 For this protocol, the patient must return to the consenting ACCRU  institution for 
evaluation  day 1 of cycle s 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17  and 19 ( see Section 4.0 Test

 7.6 Treatment with study- specific drugs by a local medical doctor (LMD) is not allowed. 
7.7  Patients who develop PD in the CNS only may receive radiotherapy and continue 
treatment on study after completion of radiotherapy . Patient must be clinically stable and 
have been off systemic corticosteroids for at least 14 days at the time of recommencement of treatment . NOTE: Both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab  should  be 
withheld for a minimum of 3 days prior to radiation and for 3 weeks after radiation.  
 7.8 Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of patients treated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD. Patients receiving treatment in this 
study will be permitted to continue treatment beyond initial PD , if the initial PD happens 
in the first 12 weeks post -registration  (by RECIST 1.1),  as long as they meet the 
following criteria:  
• Investigator- assessed clinical benefit (e.g. absence of rapid disease progression and 
absence of progressive tumor at a critical anatomic site that requires urgent 
alternative intervention), and  
• The patient is tolerating study drug. 
• Patient does not continue to progress at 4 we ek follow -up imaging after PD first 
noted. 
  
8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events  
 
Strictly follow the modifications in this table for the first two  cycles, until individual treatment 
tolerance can be ascertained.  Thereafter, these modifications should be regarded as guidelines to 
address side effects.  If multiple adverse events are seen, administer dose based on greatest 
reduction required for any single adverse event observed.  Reductions or increases apply to 
treatment given in the preceding cycle and are based on adverse events observed since the prior 
dose.

 a. A delay of study treatme nt for more than 28 days (due to treatment -related toxicities) will 
require a discussion with the ACCRU Quality Assurance Specialist  before treatment can be 
resumed  (see protocol resource page). 
 
b. Initiate optimal medical management for nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea prior to any study 
treatment, interruption, or dose reduction.  
 c. Grade 2 toxicities will be determined to be tolerable or intolerable by both the subject and 
investigator.  If Grade 2 toxicity is determined to be intolerable, the dose of study drug will 
be reduced with or without dose interruption.  Interruption for Grade 3 toxicities is 
mandatory.  
 
d. Weight loss of any grade may not require dose reduction, but should be managed based on 
the judgment of the investigator. S ubjects wit h weight loss requiring dose interruption and 
reduction do not need to return to baseline weight to restart lenvatinib.  Based on the 
judgment of the investigator, subjects may be restarted at a lower dose of lenvatinib for 
weight loss .  Consultation with a registered dietician may be helpful in managing weight loss.  
 e. Not applicable to abnormal clinical laboratory values that are not clinically relevant based on the judgment of the investigator ( e.g., ALT, AST, γ -GTP values < 10 × ULN, and Na).

  8.21 Management of Hypertension  
 
Hypertension is a known and potentially serious adverse event associated with 
lenvatinib treatment.  Patients will be given  a Blood Pressure Diary (Appendix 
III) on which to record the ir measurements.  They should be instructed to check 
their blood pressure at least three times each week, and notify the treating physician if systolic BP  ≥160  mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mmHg.  
 The following guidelines should be followed for the management of systolic 
BP ≥  160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mmHg confirmed on repeat 
measurements after an hour:  
 Continue lenvatinib and institute antihypertensive therapy for subjects not 
already receiving this.  
 For those subjects already on antihypertensive medication, the dos e of the current 
agent may be increased, if appropriate, or one or more agents of a different class of antihypertensive should be added.  
If systolic BP ≥  160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥  100 mmHg persists despite 
maximal  antihypertensive therapy, then lenvatini b administration should be 
interrupted and restarted at a dose of 14 mg once daily (or one dose level 
reduction) when systolic BP  ≤ 150 mmHg and diastolic BP  ≤ 95 mmHg and the 
subject has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours.  
 
If systolic BP ≥  16 0 m mH g or d ia sto li c BP ≥ 100  m mHg r ecu rs on  th e 20 -mg 
once daily dose despite optimal management of hypertension with 
antihypertensive medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a 
different class of antihypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be 
interrupted and restarted at a dose of 14 mg once daily (one dose level reduction) 
only when systolic BP ≤ 150 mmHg and diastolic BP  ≤ 95 mmHg and the subject 
has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for a t least 48  hours.  
 If systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mmHg recurs on the 14- mg 
once daily dose despite optimal management of hypertension with antihypertensive medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a 
different class of antih ypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be 
interrupted and restarted at a dose of 10 mg once daily (one dose level reduction) 
only when systolic BP ≤ 150 mmHg and diastolic BP  ≤ 95 mmHg and the subject 
has been on a stable dose of antihypertens ive medication for at least 48  hours. 
 
If systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mmHg recurs on the 10-mg 
once daily dose despite optimal management of hypertension with antihypertensive medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a diffe rent class of antihypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be 
interrupted and restarted at a dose of 4 mg once daily (one dose level reduction) 
only when systolic BP ≤ 150 mmHg and diastolic BP  ≤ 95 mmHg and the subject 
has been on a stable dos e of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours. 
 Additional dose reduction should be discussed with the ACCRU SAE

  Coordinator (see protocol resource page) . 
 
The following guidelines should be followed for the management of Grade 4 
hypertension (life-threatening consequences): 
• Institute appropriate medical management  
• Discontinue lenvatinib  
 
8.22 Management of Proteinuria  
 
Regular assessment of proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Test 
Schedule (Section 4.0). 
 Guidelines for assessment and management of proteinuria:  
A 24 -hour urine collection for protein quantitation is required in the following 
situations:  
 
• The first (initial) occurrence of 2+, 3+, or 4+ proteinuria on urine dipstick while 
on study drug  
• A subsequent apparent increase in severity of urine dipstick proteinuria (from the prior measurement which was ≥2+) occurring on the same lenvatinib dose lev el  
• When there has been a lenvatinib dose reduction and on follow-up, the urine 
protein dipstick result is 2+, 3+, or 4+ (at the new dose level)  
 
The 24- hour urine collection is not  required in the following situations:  
• Persistence of the same severity of proteinuria by urine dipstick at the same lenvatinib dose level (when a 24-hour urine collection has already been collected at that dose level)  
• Subsequent occurrences of 2+, 3+, or 4+ proteinuria by urine dipstick when the subject has been off study drug  
 
Grading of proteinuria should be performed according to CTCAE v4.03 (Appendix 3) 
BUT will be based on the 24 -hour urine collection for total protein result, if a 24-hour 
urine was performed at that time point.  
 For su bjects with lenvatinib -related toxicity, the dose reduction and/or 
interruption instructions provided in Table 2 of the study protocol should be followed. 
 
8.23 Management of Hepatotoxicity  
 Regular monitoring of liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin levels) should be 
conducted as clinically indicated.  If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury 
occur, instructions contained in Table 8.2, “ Dose Modifications  for Lenvatinib -
Related Toxicities ” should be followed.  Appropriate supportive care should be 
provided together with close monitoring.  If hepatic failure occurs, lenvatinib 
must be discontinued.

  8.24 Management of Venous and Arterial Thromboembolic Events 
 
Subjects should be advised to pay attention to symptoms suggestive of venous 
thromboembolic events, which include acute onset of shortness of breath, 
dyspnea, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, signs 
of deep vein thrombosis  including lower -extremity swelling, and warmth to 
touch or tenderness.  In case any of these symptoms appear, subjects should be 
instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the treating physician.  If a 
venous thromboembolic event is confirmed, instructio ns contained in Table 8.2, 
“Dose Modifications for Lenvatinib- Related Toxicities ” should be 
followed.  Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close 
monitoring.    
 If a subject experiences any  arterial  thromboembolic event , lenvatinib must be

8.25 Management of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome    In clinical studies with lenvatinib, events of posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES) were reported in less than 1% of lenvatinib- treated 
subjects.   PRES is a neurological disorder, which can present with headache, 
seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual 
or neurological disturbances.  Mild to severe hypertension may be present.  MRI 
is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.   Appropriate measures should be 
taken to control BP.  In subjects with signs or symptoms of PRES, dose 
interruptions, dose adjustments, or discontinuation may be required as per 
instructions included in Table 8.2. 
 
8.26 Management of Hypocalcemia  
 
Serum calcium should be monitored per the Test Schedule ( Section  
4).  Hypocalcemia should be treated per institutional guidelines (eg,  using 
appropriate calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution.

  9.3 Patients should receive full supportive care while on this study.  This includes blood product support, antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnosed or 
concurrent medical conditions.  All blood products and concomitant medications such as 
antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from the first day of study 
treatment administration until 30 days after the final dose w ill be recorded in the medical 
records and on the case report form (CRF) . 
 
9.4 Diarrhea/Colitis:  
 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and  
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
 For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral  
corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists >1 week, treat with intravenous 
steroids followed by high dose oral steroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
9.5 All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community 
standards of medical care.  All concomitant medication will be recorded  in the medical 
record and  on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over -the-counter 
(OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and d ate may also be 
included on the CRF.

 The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapies during the Post- Treatment Follow -up Phase. 
 
9.7 Pneumonitis: 
 For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids. Administer  
additional antiinflammatory measures, as needed. Add prophylactic a ntibiotics for 
opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid administration.  
 
9.8 Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA)  
 For T1DM or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 
• Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for  
Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria. 
 
• Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabo lic panel, urine ketones,  
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide. 
 
9.9 Hypophysitis: 
 
For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 
or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by oral 
corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
9.9a Additional Supportive Care Guidelines for Pembrolizumab  
 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the  
treating investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse  
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use o f oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as 
     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  40                                            Addendum 6 
  additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids.  
 Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen  
when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule 
out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require  additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied 
when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, 
or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.   
9.9a1 Hepatic:  
 For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to  
baseline values (consider weekly). 
o Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids 
 
For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours. 
 When symptoms improve  to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
9.9a2 Renal Failure or Nephritis: 
 For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
 
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
9.9a3 Management of Infusion Reactions: Signs and symptoms usually develop during 
or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of 
completion of infusion.  
 
10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
The site principal investigator is responsible for reporting any/all serious adverse events to the sponsor as described within the protocol, regardless of attribution to study agent or treatment 
procedure.  
 
The sponsor/sponsor- investigator is responsible for notifying FDA and all participating 
investigators in a written safety report of any of the following:  
 
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  
• Any findings from laboratory animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for 
human subjects, including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  41                                            Addendum 6 
  • Any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies, whether or not conducted under an IND and whether or not conducted by 
the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug.  
• Any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over the rate stated in the protocol or Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).  
 
Definitions  
 
Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  
 Expedited Reporting  
Events reported to sponsor within 24 hours, 5 days or 10 days of study team becoming aware of the event.  
 
Routine Reporting 
Events reported to sponsor via case report forms 
 
Events of Interest  
Events that would not typically be considered to meet the criteria for expedited reporting, 
but that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to 
facilitate the review of safety data (may be requested by t he FDA or the sponsor).  
 
 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:   The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be used  for AE reporting.   All appropriate treatment areas should have access to 
a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
     
 
a. Adve
rse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.   
b. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0.   
c. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2).  
d. Determine if the adve rse event is related to the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
e. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechanism (see Section 10.4).  

     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  42                                            Addendum 6 
  f. Determine if other report ing is required (see Section 10.5). 
g. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.6 and 
18.0). 
Each CTCAE term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event 
used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single MedDRA Lowest 
Level Term (LLT).  
 NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by the above grading scale, is NOT the same as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
  
10.2  Expected vs. Unexpected Events   
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator brochure, (if 
an investigator brochure is not required, otherwise described in the general 
investigational plan).  
 Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if a pplicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
 
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not been observed with the drug under investigation. 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE)  
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan 
or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects  
 
10.3 Assessm ent of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).

  Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the 
drug/device and the adverse event.  
. 
10.31  AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on 
the SAME  (Combination)Arm  
When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as the 
investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular 
product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination 
(arm) is then considered an investigational  intervention for reporting . These 
AEs should be as sessed as specified in the appropriate IND/IDE  reporting 
guidelines in Section 10.4  
 
10.32  Special Situations for Expedited Reporting  
EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events: Protocol Specific Exceptions to 
Expedited Reporting   
For this protocol only, the following Adv erse Events/Grades are expected to 
occur within this population and do not require Expedited Reporting. These 
events must still be reported via Routine Reporting (see Section 10.5). *

*These exclusions only apply if the adverse event does not result in hospitalization . If the 
adverse event results in hospitalization, then the standard expedited adverse events 
reporting requirements must be followed.  
 *Report any clinically important inc rease in the rate of a serious suspected adverse 
reaction (at your study) site over that which is listed in the protocol or investigator brochure as an expedited event.  
*Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than expected as an    
expedited event  
*An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated with a 
commercial agent.  Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required.   
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to Merck or Eisai as 
described in Section 10.4 - Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the ACCRU  and 
to Merck, unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the dru g and

A list of known/expected AEs is reported in the investigator brochure, package insert or 
the literature, including AEs resulting from a drug overdose. 
 
10.321  Death  
• Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24- hours.  
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an 
IND/IDE  requires expedited reporting within 24- hours. 
• Reportable categories of Death : Death attributable to a 
CTCAE term.  
 
• Death Neonatal:  A disorder characterized by cessation of 
life during the first 28 days of life.  
 
• Death NOS:  A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
 
• Sudden death NOS:  A sudden (defined as instant or within 
one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attrib uted to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5.  
 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
(including cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive 
Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the  same 
name.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting 
tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration 
associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
 
10.322  Secondary Malignancy  
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, 
radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not 
considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
 

     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  46                                            Addendum 6 
  • All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE to be reported. Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML])  
o Myel odysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting 
mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
10.323  Second Malignancy  
 
• A second  malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior 
malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  
Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting.  
 
10.324 Pregnancy  
 
Prior to obtaining private information about a pregnant woma n and her 
infant, the investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn infant’s parent or legal guardian before any data 
collection can occur.  A consent form will need to be submitted to the 
IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy occurs. If informed consent is not 
obtained, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or abortion the mother is the patient. 
In cases where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other 
than fetal death, the child/fet us is the patient.  
 Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is 
the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any 
pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them) that occurs during the trial.  
Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but 
before treatment allocation/randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are 
the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited 
to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or 
a procedure.   
Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment 
allocation/randomization through 120 days following c essation of study 
drugs , or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates 
new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the 
investigator.  All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of th e pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of 
spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, 
     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  47                                            Addendum 6 
  blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the 
pregnancy c ontinues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be 
reported. 
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with 
pembrolizumab, the subject will immediately be removed from the study.  
The site will contact the subject at least monthly and document the 
subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  
The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to 
Merck without delay and within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck if  the outcome is a serious adverse experience 
(e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-
threatening complication to the mother or newborn).   
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to 
follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus 
or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject impregnates his female 
partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and 
the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to Merck and followed as described above.  
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 
2 business days to Merck Global Safety

10.5 Other Required Reporting  
 
10.51  U
nanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSOS) in general, 
include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all the following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
 3. Suggests t hat the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the physical or 
psychological harm associated with adverse events.  In other cases, unanticipated 
problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs. 
 
Note: If there is no language in the protocol indicating that pregnancy is not considere d 
an adverse experience for this trial, and if the consent form does not indicate that subjects 
should not get pregnant/impregnate others, then any pregnancy in a subject/patient or a 
male patient’s partner (spontaneously reported) which occurs during the study or within 120 days of completing the study should be reported as a UPIRTSO. 
If the event meets the criteria for an UPIRTSO, submit to your IRB as required by your 
institutional policies.

10.56   Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical 
Interest (ECI) and must be reported within 24 hours to the ACCRU SAE Coordinator 
using the ACCRU Adverse Event Expedited Report Form. Within 2 working days , the 
ACCRU SAE Coordinator will report  to Merck Global Safety.  

     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  51                                            Addendum 6 
   
 For
 the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment 
allocation/randomization, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to ACCRU and within 2 working days to Merck Global 
Safety i f it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol-
specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
 
For the time period beginning a t treatment allocation/randomization through 90 days 
following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the 
subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any ECI, or follow up to an 
ECI, whether or not related to Merck product, must be reported within 24 hours to 
ACCRU and within 24 hours to Merck Global Safety. 
 
Events of clinical interest for this trial include:  
 
1.  An  overdose of pembrolizumab , as defined below that is not associated with 
clinical symptoms  or abnormal laboratory results.  
 2.  An  elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper 
limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or 
equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same t ime, an alkaline 
phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory 
testing.*  
 
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
 
 
Overdose: For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as 
any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is 
available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subje ct 
should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should 
be provided if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of pembrolizumab, 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met.  
If a dose of pembrolizumab meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without 
any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported 
as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or 
intentional overdose without adverse effect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 
hours to the ACCRU  SAE Coordinator using t he ACCRU Adve rse Event Expedited

11.0 Treatment Evaluation Using RECIST Guideline  
 
NOTE:  This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011.  See the footnote for 
the table regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and 
analysis.  
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines 
(version 1.1) .  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the short axis measurements in the case of  lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
guideline . 
 
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations:  For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated 
every 6 weeks  to 18 weeks after treatment initiation, then every 12 weeks until end of 
active study treatment (54 weeks) .  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans 
should also be obtained at least 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective 
response.  
 11.2 Definitions of Measurable and Non -Measurable Disease  
 
11.21   Measurable Disease  
 
11.211 A non- nodal lesion is considered measurable if its longest diameter can 
be accurately measured as ≥1.0 cm with CT scan, CT component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
 11.212 A superficial non- nodal lesion is measurable if its longest diameter is ≥ 
1.0 cm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or imaging.  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 
11.213 A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.5 
cm when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to 
be no greater than 5 mm).   
 NOTE:   Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are not considered 
measurable disease.   
 
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease  
 
11.221  All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non -measurable 
disease, including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0  to 
<1.5 cm).  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory 
breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable as well.  

     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  53                                            Addendum 6 
   
Note:  ‘Cyst ic lesions’ thought to repr esent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of 
measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non- pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded or 
followed. 
 
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
11.31  Measurement Methods:   
 
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal 
fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least 1 cm to less 
than 2 cm must use CT imaging for both pre - and post -treatment tumor 
assessments.   
• Imaging- based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination 
when both methods have been used at the same evaluation to assess the 
antitumor effect of a treatment.   
 
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease:       
 
• Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm 
or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum 
size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.     
 
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type 
and site of disease.  The lesions should be measured on the same pulse 
seque nce.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  
Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if 
possible. 
 
• PET- CT:  If the site can  document that the CT performed as part of a PET -
CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional C T in 
accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.   
 
• FDG- PET:  FDG -PET scanning is allowed to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' 
disease.  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is 
FDG avid with an update greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on 
the attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an FDG -PET scanned lesion is 
     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  54                                            Addendum 6 
  considered ‘negative.’  New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be 
identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is 
a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
 b.   No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:   
 
i. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.   
 ii. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site 
of dise ase on CT at the same evaluation, additional follow -up CT 
scans (i.e., additional follow -up scans at least 4 weeks later) are 
needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site. In this situation, the date of PD will be the date of th e initial 
abnormal PDG- PET scan.   
 iii If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, it is not classified as PD.  
 
11.33 Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation:   
 
• A subsequent scan must be obtained  ≥4 weeks following initial 
documentation of an objective status of either complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR).  
 
• In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have met 
the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interv al of  4 
weeks (see Section 11.44).  
 
• The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate betwe en 
response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
 
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ  cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.) 
 
11.4 Measurement of Effect  
 
11.41  Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 lesions, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target 
Lesions” and recorded and measured at baseline.  These lesions can be non -
nodal or nodal (as defined in 11.21) , where no more than 2 lesions are from 
the same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  55                                            Addendum 6 
   Note:  If fewer than 5  target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified (as 
there often will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions.   
 
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on t he basis of their 
size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should 
be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may 
be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.   
 
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD):  A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD).  The 
BSD will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response in the measurable dimensio n of the disease.   
 
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD):  A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the post -baseline sum of 
dimensions (PBSD ).  If the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure 
for the target lesion (or target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it 
is below 0.5 cm.  If the target lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be 
present and is  faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 0.5 cm should be 
assigned.  If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the target lesion or target 
lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 
cm. 
 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions ( MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and 
the PBSD.  
  
11.42  Non-Target Lesions & Non-Target Lymph Nodes 
 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at   
baseline.  These lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 
11.433. 
 11.43 Response Criteria 
 
11.431  All target lesions and target lymph nodes followed by 
 CT/MRI/PET- CT/Chest X -ray/physical examination must be measured 
on re -evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 11.1.  
Specifically, a change in objective status to either a PR or CR cannot be done without re-measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes.  
 
Note: Non-target lesions and non- target lymph nodes should be

  evaluated at each assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of response.  In selected circumstances, certain non -target 
organs may be evaluated less frequently.  For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identified in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
 
11.432 Evaluation of Target L esions  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 b. Each target lymph node must have 
reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm. 
 
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of 
the longest diameter for all target lesions 
plus the sum of the short axis of all the 
target lymph nodes at current evaluation) 
taking as reference the BSD (see Section 
11.41). 
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be 
true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, 
which also includes any lymph node 
that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥ 1.0 cm 
short axis during follow-up.  
 b. At least a 20% increase in PBSD 
(sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum o f the 
short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as 
reference the MSD (Section 11.41).  
In addition, the PBSD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 
at least 0.5 cm from the MSD.  
 c. See Section 11.32 for details in 
regards to the requirements for PD 
via FDG- PET imaging.  
  
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for 
PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD taking as reference the MSD.

  11.433 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions & Non -target Lymph Nodes 
 
• Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all non -target 
lesions.  
 
b. Each non- target lymph node must 
have a reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm. 
 
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes.  
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be 
true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, 
 which also includes  any lymph node 
 that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm 
 short axis) and increased to ≥ 
 1.0 cm short axis during follow -up.   
 b. Unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions and non- target 
lymph nodes.  (NOTE:  Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion and target lymph node status.  It must be representative 
of overall disease status change.)

ACCRU protocol RECIST v1.1 template as of 2/16/2011 and to match RECIST v1.1 
requireme nts. 
 
 Note:   For those patients who have initial PD in the first 12 weeks post -registration, a 
confirmation scan will be required 4 weeks later to confirm PD. See Section 13.7 for 
further details. If progression is confirmed then the date of disease progression will be the 
first date the patient met the criteria for progression based on standard RECIST 1.1 
criteria.  
  
11.45 Symptomatic Deterioration: Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time, and not either related to study treatment or other medical 
conditions, should be reported as PD due to “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every 
effort should be made to document the objective progression even afte r 
discontinuation of treatment due to symptomatic deterioration.  A patient is classified as having PD due to “symptomatic deterioration” if any of the following occur that are not either related to study treatment or other medical 
conditions:

 13.0 Treatment/Follow –up Decision at Evaluation of Patient   
 
13.1 Patients who are CR, PR, or SD will continue treatment per protocol.  
13.2 Patients who develop PD while receiving therapy or refuse treatment or choose 
alternative therapy will go to the event -monitoring phase  per Section 18.0 and be 
followed every 180 days for a maximum of 3 years from study registration. (See 
exceptions in 13.5 and 13.6.)  
 
13.3 Patients who go off protocol treatment for reasons other than those listed in Section 13.2 
above (e.g., adverse even ts, other complicating disease)  will go to Observation and will 
follow the test schedule (Section 4.0) every 84 days for a maximum of 3 years from study registration. If they progress or choose alternative therapy while in Observation, they will go to the event -monitoring phase.  
 13.4 OBSERVATION:   The study treatment period is 54 weeks  (19 cycles) . Patients who are 
receiving clinical benefit (i.e., in CR or PR or SD ) and who are tolerating treatment at the 
end of the study treatment period may  continue on therapy for a n additional 12 months.   
After study treatment has been discontinued, they should be observed every 12 weeks 
until PD or a maximum follow -up of 3 years from study registration.  Once the patient 
has PD during observation, they will be followed in the event -monitoring phase for a 
maximum follow -up of 3 years from study registration (see Section 18.0).  Subsequent 
treatment is at the discretion of their attending physician.  NOTE: If the patient continues 
for an additional 12 months of treatment beyond the initial 54 weeks, the patient should follow the same test schedule, per protocol, as is done during the initial 54- week period . 
 
13.5 Patients who develop PD in the CNS may  receive radiotherapy and continue treatment on 
study after completion of  radiotherapy. NOTE: Both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
should be withheld for a minimum of 3 days prior to radiation and for 3 weeks after radiation.

  13.6 Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of patients treated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD. Patients receiving treatment in this 
study will be permitted to continue treatment beyond initial PD , if the initial PD happens  
in the first 12 weeks post -registration  (by RECIST 1.1), as long as they meet the 
following criteria:  
 
• Investigator- assessed clinical benefit (e.g. absence of rapid disease progression 
and absence of progressive tumor at a critical anatomic site that requires urgent alternative intervention), and  
• The patient is tolerating study drug. 
• Patient does not continue to progress at 4 week follow -up imaging after PD first 
noted. 
 
Patients with initial  progression will be assessed with clinical judgment as to whether the 
patient is deriving clinical benefit from treatment and should continue study treatment or 
discontinue and enter the follow up/survival phase of the study. If progression is 
confirmed then the date of disease progression will be the first date the patient met the 
criteria for progression  based on the standard RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
 13.7 A patient is deemed ineligible  if after registration, it is determined that at the time of 
registration, the patient did not satisfy each and every eligibility cr iteria for study entry.  
The patient may continue treatment off -protocol at the discretion of the physician as long 
as there are no safety concerns, and the patient was properly registered. The patient will 
go directly to the event -monitoring phase of the study (or off study, if applicable).  
• If the patient received treatment, all data up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted.  Event monitoring will be required per Section 18.0 of the protocol.  
• If the patient never received treatment, on -study material must be subm itted. Event 
monitoring will be required per Section 18.0 of the protocol.  
 
13.8 A patient is deemed a major violation , if protocol requirements regarding treatment in 
cycle 1 of the initial therapy are severely violated that evaluability for primary end point 
is questionable.  All data up until the point of confirmation of a major violation must be 
submitted.  The patient will go directly to the event -monitoring phase of the study.  The 
patient may continue treatment off- protocol at the discretion of the physician as long as 
there are no safety concerns, and the patient was properly registered.  Event monitoring 
will be required per Section 18.0 of the protocol. 
13.9 A patient is deemed a cancel i f he/she is removed from the study for any reason before 
any study treatment is given.  On- study material and Off-Treatment Form  must be 
submitted.  Event monitoring will be required per protocol ( Section 18.0).

  14.2 Study Methodology and Storage Information  
 
14.21 Blood/blood product s amples will be collected for the following research  
 
NOTE: research blood samples should not be collected and submitted until after  
the patient is registered onto the study, but prior  to beginning study treatment. 
 
14.211 The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated by 
density gradient from approximately 24ml peripheral blood. In Cohort 1, 
Samples  will be collected  before treatment, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 7 Day 
1 and Cycle 19 Day 1, or time of withdrawal or remo val. In Cohort 2, a 
single blood draw will be performed pretreatment or at any point during the study in order to generate a source of normal DNA. PBMC will be 
washed and cryopreserved for later analysis by flow cytometry and as a 
source of normal control DNA.  Cells will be aliq uoted in 
cryopreservation media, frozen  at -80°C and shipped overnight on dry 
ice. For long- term storage, frozen cells will be stored in liquid nitrogen 
and shipped on liquid nitrogen.  (S ee Laboratory Manual, Cohort 1) 
 
14.212 Serum will be isolated from blood for analysis of TPO and Tg 
autoantibody levels . Samples  will be collected  before treatment  and on 
Day 1 of Cycle 7. Autoantibody levels will be run at the University of 
Colorado Hospital (UCH) providing uniform testing in a CLIA accredited clinical laboratory.  The Siemens ADVIA Centaur XP anti -
TPO assay at UCH has an analytical sensitivity of 28 U/mL and a dynamic range of 28– 1300 U/mL. The Beckman Coulter Access 
Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay at UCH has an analytical sensitivity of 0.9 IU/mL and a dynamic range of 0.9- 2500 IU/mL. Baseline 
autoantibody status (positiv e or negative) and titer as well as 
autoantibody level changes over the treatment period will be correlated with response to therapy.  Serum will be isolated from 7. 5 mL of blood, 
aliquoted into 4 cyrovials, and frozen at -80°C for 48 hours before 
shipping overnight on dry ice  (See Laboratory Manual, Cohorts 1 and 2) 
 
14.213 DNA and RNA will be extracted from peripheral blood to generate a 
baseline control for the studies detailed in Section 17. Remaining DNA 
and RNA will be stored frozen at   - 80ºC at the University of Colorado, 
according to patient consent information (see Section  6.12) until specific 
analyses are identified.    As protocols are developed, they will be 
presented for  ACCRU, ITOG,  and IRB review and approval.  (This 
collection is part of  a general strategy of investigation for the majority of 
ACCRU studies.) 
 
14.214 As part of ongoing ACCRU  research, remaining serum will be stored 
frozen at -80ºC at University of Colorado, according to patient consent 
information (See Section 6.15) for fu ture studies until specific analyses 
are identified. As protocols are developed, they will be presented for  
ACCRU, ITOG  and IRB review and approval.

 14.3 Return of Genetic Testing Research Results  
 
 Because the results generated by the genetic testing included in this section are not 
currently anticipated to have clinical relevance to the patient or their family members, the genetic results will not be disclosed to the patients or their physicians. 
  If at any time, genetic results are obtained that may have clinical relevance, IRB review 
and approval will be sought regarding the most appropriate manner of disclosure and 
whether or not validation in a CLIA -certified sett ing will be required.  Sharing of 
research data with individual patients should only occur when data have been validated 
by multiple studies and testing has been done in CLIA- approved laboratories.  
 15.0 Drug Information  
 
IND #132069 
 15.1 Lenvatinib   (LENVIMA®)  
• Investigator brochure is  available on the ACCRU web site. 
  15.11 Background : Lenvatinib is an oral, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 
inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth f actor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and 
VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-
related RTKs including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, 
and 4; the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) re ceptor PDGFRα; KIT; and 
RET.  
 15.12 Formulation :  Lenvatinib is available as 1 mg, 4 mg and 10 mg capsules.  The 
following are inactive ingredients: Calcium Carbonate, USP; Mannitol, USP; Microcrystalline Cellulose, NF; Hydroxypropyl Cellulose, NF; Hydroxypropyl 
Cellulose (type H), NF; and Talc, USP. The hypromellose capsule shell contains 
titanium dioxide, ferric oxide yellow, and ferric oxide red. The printing ink contains shellac, black iron oxide, potassium hydroxide, and propylene glycol. 
 15.13 Preparation and storage : Store at controlled room temperature, 25 degrees C 
(77 degrees F), with excursions permitted between 15 and 30 degrees C (59 and 86 degrees F). 
 
15.14 Administration :  Take lenvatinib at the same time each day with or without 
food. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. If a patient misses a 
dose, and it cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose should be omitted  
and the next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration. 
 
Alternatively,  add the lenvatinib capsules to a tablespoon of water or apple juice 
in a small glass to produce a suspension. Leave the capsules in the liquid for at 
least 10 minutes. Stir for at least 3 minutes. Drink the mixture. After drinking, 
add the same amount (1 tablespoon) of water or apple juice to the glass. Swirl the 
contents a few times and swallow the additional liquid.

  This can also be administered by gastric feeding tube. 
  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
 Absorption:   Lenvatinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with tmax 
typically observed from 1 to 4 hours post dose. Food does not affect the extent of 
absorption, but slows the rate of absorption. When administered to healthy 
subjects with food, peak plasma concentrations are delayed by 2 hours.  
   Distribution:   In vitro binding of lenvatinib to human plasma proteins is high 
and ranged from 98% to 99% (0.3 – 30 μg/mL, mesilate). This binding was 
mainly to albumin with minor binding to α1- acid glycoprotein and γ -globulin.  In 
vitro blood to plasma ratios of lenvatinib (0.1 - 10 μg/mL) remained constant in 
humans (0.589 – 0.608).  
  
 Metabolism:   Lenvatinib is extensively metabolized in humans. The main 
metabolic pathways in humans were identified as oxidation by AO, demethylation via CYP3A4, glutathione conjugation with elimination of the O -
aryl group (chlorbenzyl moiety), and combinations of these pathways followed 
by further biotransformations (eg, glucuronidation, hydrolysis of the glutathione 
moiety, degradation of the cysteine moiety, and intramolecular rearrangement of 
the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates with subsequent dimerization). 
  
 Half -life elimination:   Plasma concentrations decline bi -exponentially following 
Cmax. The terminal exponential half-life of lenvatinib is about 28 hours. 
  
 Excretion:   Following administration of radiolabeled lenvatinib to 6 subjects 
with solid tu mors, approximately two -thirds and one -fourth of the radiolabel 
were eliminated in the feces and urine, respectively.  
 
 Special populations:  No dose adjustments are required on the basis of hepatic 
function in patients with mild (Child -Pugh A) or moderate (Child- Pugh B) 
hepatic impairment. In patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment, the starting dose should be lowered. No dose adjustments are required on the 
basis of renal function in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. In 
patients with severe renal impairment, the starting dose should be lowered. 
Further dose adjustments may be necessary on the basis of individual t olerability.  
 
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :  In vitro, cytochrome P450 3A4 was the 
predominant (>80%) cytochrome isoform involved in the P450- mediated 
metabolism of lenvatinib. In vivo, inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 had a 
minimal effect on lenvati nib exposure. Lenvatinib is not considered a strong 
inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 or uridine 5´ -diphospho-glucuronosyl 
transferase (UGT) enzymes.  Lenvatinib may be co -administered without dose 
adjustment with CYP3A, P -glycoprotein (P -gp), and BC RP inhibitors or CYP3A 
and P-gp inducers.

ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  68                                            Addendum 6 
    Investigator brochure is available on the ACCRU web site. 
 15.21 Background :  Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody 
with high specificity of binding to the PD -1 receptor, thus inhibiting its 
interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2. Based on preclinical in vitro  data, 
pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD-1. 
 15.22 Formulation :  Pembrolizumab is available as a liquid 25 mg/mL, 100 mg/vial.   
 15.23  Preparation and storage : Vials should be stored in the refrigerator at 
temperatures between 2 -8°C (36-46ºF).   
 
Drug concentrate is further diluted with normal saline  (or 5% dextrose) in the 
concentration range of 1 to 10 mg/mL  in IV containers made of polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) or non -PVC material.  The infusion solution in the IV bag should 
be immediately administered.  Diluted pembrolizumab solutions may be stored at room temperature for a cumulative period of up to 4 hours. This includes room temperature storage of admixture solutions in the IV bags and the duration of 
infusion.  The product can also be stored under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C for no 
more than 96 hours from the time of dilution. If  refrigerated, the diluted solution 
must be allowed to come to room temperature prior to administration. The 
solution must be discarded after 6 hours at room temperature or 96 hours  under 
refrigeration.    
15.24 Administration:   Pembrolizumab is  administered by intravenous infusion over 
30 minutes via a 0.22 micron in- line filter. The final infusion volume must be 
between 1 and 10 mg/mL. Maximum rate of infusion should not exceed 6.7 
mL/minute through a peripheral or indwelling catheter. Flush th e line with 0.9% 
NaCL following the completion of the infusion. 
  15.25 Pharmacokinetic information : 
 a) Absorption –Because pembrolizumab is administered intravenously, it is 
immediately and completely bioavailable.  Steady -state concentrations of 
pembrol izumab are reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with a Q3W regimen 
and the systemic accumulation is 2.1 -fold. The peak concentration, trough 
concentration, and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at 
steady state of pembrolizumab increas ed dose proportionally in the dose range of 
2 to 10 mg/kg Q3W. 
 b)  Distribution – Pembrolizumab has a limited volume of distribution.  
 c)  Excretion – CL is approximately 23% lower after achieving maximal change 
at steady state compared with the first dose. T he terminal elimination half -life 
(t½) is estimated to be 2 2 days  at steady state . 
 d)  Metabolism - Pembrolizumab is catabolized through non- specific pathways ; 
metabolism does not contribute to its CL . 
  
 There are no limited clinical studies on the subcutaneous formulation. 
Model- based analysis showed an estimated bioavailability of 64% (95% 
CI: 54% to 74%; variability, 128% CV). This is consistent with the reported bioavailability for other mAbs (range: 5 0% to 85%) given SC. 
Clearance was the same for the IV and SC formulations. The mean time to 
achieve maximum concentration (T
max) with pembrolizumab SC was

The risk profile for pembrolizumab also includes two important potential risks: a) 
myasthenic syndrome, and b) an increased risk of severe complications (such as 
early severe graft versus host disease and veno -occlusive disease) of allogeneic 
transplant in pat ients with hematologic malignancies who have previously been 
treated with PD -1 inhibitors.  
 
Patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with pembrolizumab in 
combination with either pomalidomide or lenalidomide and dexamethasone, had an increased number of serious side effects and deaths as compared to patients 
who received only dexamethasone and either pomalidomide or lenalidomide. The 
benefit- risk profile is unfavorable for the combination of pembrolizumab, 
pomalidomide, and dexamethasone in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, and 
the combination of pembrolizumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed treatment -naive multiple myeloma.

15.29 Nursing Guidelines:  
 
15.291 Pembrolizumab side effects vary greatly from those of traditional 
chemotherapy and can vary in severity from mild to life threatening. Instruct patients to report any side effects to the study team immediately. 
Side effects may be immediate or delayed up to months after 
discontinuation of therapy. Most side effects are reversible with prompt 
intervention of corticosteroids.

  15.292 Diarrhea can be seen , however, it is less common than what is  seen with 
anti-CTLA -4 agents. I t can  occasionally  be severe, leading to colonic 
perforation. Instruct patients to report ANY increase in the number of stools and/or change in baseline, blood in the stool, abdominal pain to the 
study team immediately.  
 
15.293 Rash/ pruritus /dermatitis is seen. Patients should report any rash to the 
study team. Treat per section 9.0 and monitor for effectiveness.  
 
15.294 Monitor LFT’s closely as elevations in these levels could indicate early 
onset autoimmune hepatitis. Patients should also be instr ucted to report 
any jaundice, or right upper quadrant pain to the study team immediately.  
 15.295 Pneumonitis can be seen and may be mild (only seen on imaging) to 
severe. Patients should be instructed to report any shortness of breath, dyspnea, cough, and/or  chest pain to the study team immediately. 
Patients reporting these symptoms should have a pulse oximetry  checked 
and consider immediate imaging per the treating physician. 
 
15.296 Endocrinopathies (including hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, 
hypophysitis , and adrenal insufficiency) are seen with this agent. Patients 
may present only with the vague sense of fatigue and “not feeling well.” 
Additional symptoms may be that of nausea, sweating and decreased activity tolerance. Instruct patients to report thes e signs or symptoms 
immediately and obtain appropriate labs as ordered by the treating physician.  
 15.297 Patients who are started on steroid therapy for any side effects of pembrolizumab  toxicity should be instructed to take the steroids as 
ordered, and not to discontinue abruptly as symptoms may return and be severe. Patients may be on steroid therapy for weeks. Instruct patients to 
report any increase or change in side effects with any dosage decrease as 
patients may need a slower taper.  
 
15.298 Fatigue is common and may or may not be associated with immune - 
related side effects. Assess patient’s fatigue level prior to each cycle of therapy and report any changes to the study team.

16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 
 16.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 
 16.11 Background/Overview :  This novel study will be the first to assess 
pembrolizumab  and lenvatinib combination therapy in advanced DTC (and in 
any cancer).  There is an ongoing basket trial ( KEYNOTE -028 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ) that has enrolled patients with advanced thyroid cancer to a 
single agent pembrolizumab (200 mg iv every 3 weeks) study.  Preliminary data from the thyroid cohort in this trial was presented at the 2016 American Society for Clinical Oncology (Mehnert JM, et al, J Clin Oncol 34, 2016 (suppl; abstr 
6091)).  The study enrolled 22 patients with DTC, with a median duration of 
follow-up of 74 weeks (29- 87 weeks).  No patients achieved a CR (0%) and 2 
patients had a PR (9.1%), with 12 having SD (54%), which is why we will not have a pembrolizumab -only arm in this study .    Our study will be done for 2 
different cohorts (Cohort 1: Lenvatinib-naïve patients; Cohort 2: progressed on 
Lenvatinib alone).  Both cohorts will receive the same combination therapy.  
The primary endpoint is different for the 2 cohorts, as described below (16.12 
and 16.14).  This study will also assess many secondary endpoints as well, as 
explained in detail below (16.3).  Finally, this study will also assess important correlative science endpoints (16.4).           
 
16.12  Overview and Primary Endpoint for Cohort 1 :  The complete response (CR)  rate  
for lenvatinib alone was around 2%.  The CR for patients with advanced DTC 
treated with pembrolizumab is 0% (see Section 16.11).  A CR rate of around 15% 
would be clinically significant and worthy of further study.  The primary 
endpoint for Cohort 1 is this CR rate (per RECIST 1.1 criteria).   All patients 
meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have begun 
treatment will be considered evaluab le for the primary endpoint.  A patient that 
has a CR (Cohort 1) is considered a treatment “success”.  The following one-
stage binomial design  (see below)  requires 25 evaluable patients, and 
simultaneously discriminates between CR rates of 2 % vs. 15%.    
 
   16.13 Decision Rules for Cohort 1:  
 
 16.131 Final Analysis Decision Rule :  Enroll 25 total evaluable patients.  If at 
least 2 patients have a success (at least 8%) among the 25 evaluable 
patients, this combination therapy would be considered worthy of further 
testing in this disease.  If 0 or 1 patients have a success , this combination 
therapy will be considered negative and no further study would be warranted.   
 
 16.132  Power and Significance Level:  This design has 91% power to detect a 
     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  74                                            Addendum 6 
  true success rate of 15%, with a significance level of 0.09 if the true success rate is 2%.  
 16.14  Overview and Primary Endpoint for Cohort 2:  It is expected that the confirmed 
response rate is around 5% in this disease population.  A confirmed response rate 
of around 25% would be clinically significant and worthy of further study.  The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is this confirmed response rate (per RECIST 1.1 criteria).   All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent 
form and have begun treatment will be considered evaluab le for the primary 
endpoint.  A confirmed tumor response is defined to be a CR or PR noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart.  A patient 
that has a confirmed response (Cohort 2) is considered a treatment “success”.  The following 2- stage Simon Optimal MinMax design (s ee below) requires a 
maximum of 25 evaluable patients, and simulta neously discriminates between 
confirmed response  rates of 5% vs. 25%.   
 
   16.15 Decision Rules for Cohort 2:  
 
16.151  Final Analysis Decision Rule :  Enroll 25 evaluable patients.  If at le ast 4 
patients have a success (at least 16%) among the 25 evaluable patients, 
this combination therapy would be considered worthy of further testing 
in this disease.  If 3 or fewer patients have a success, this combination 
therapy will be considered negative and no further study would be 
warranted.  
 
16.152  Stage 1 Decision Rule :  After the first 15 patients entered into the trial 
become evaluable for the primary endpoint, a stage 1 analysis will be 
performed.  If 1 or more patients have a success, the study will continue 
to full accrual.  Otherwise, if 0 successes are observed, the study will be stopped early and the treatment will be considered ineffective in this 
patient population.  Accrual will stop after we enroll the first 15 eligible 
patients to this  cohort. 
 
 16.153 Power and Significance Level:  This design has 90% power to detect a 
true success rate of 25 %, with a significance level of 0.05 if the true 
success rate is 5%.  
 
   16.16 Over Accrual:   If more than the target numb er of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stopping rule or used in any decision making process.   
 
   16.17 Other Considerations:  Toxicity, quality/duration of response, and patterns of 
treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate 
the study. 
 
 16.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
16.21 Sample Size :  A total of 25 evaluable Cohort 1 and 25 evaluable Cohort 2  
patients will be accrued per study design  (50 evaluable total) , unless one or both 
cohorts of the study are permanently closed at the stage 1 analysis or undue 
     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  75                                            Addendum 6 
  toxicity is observed.  We ant icipate accruing an additional 10 patients (5 Cohort 
1, 5 Cohort 2) in order to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment 
violation, or other reasons.  Therefor e, maximum accrual is 60 patients for this 
trial (30 for each Cohort). 
 
16.22 Accrual Time and Study Duration :  We expect to accrue about 3 patients per 
month to this trial.  Therefore, the accrual period for this Phase II study is expected to be about 20 months.  We anticipate that the study will take 
approximately 3 years to complete.  This allows a 6 month follow-up for the final patient enrolled, along with data entry, data clean- up, and analysis.  
 
 16.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints for both Cohorts. 
 
This study will assess multiple secondary endpoints, including adverse events, 
progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) .  All these analyses will be 
done for each cohort separately.    In addition, all primary/secondary data will be summarized by descriptive factors as well (i.e. prior treatment, etc.).    
 
16.31 Adverse Events : All patients that have initiated treatment will be considered 
evaluable for assessing adverse events. The maximum grade for each type of 
adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be 
reviewed to determine adverse event pat terns.  Only the grade 2+ adverse events 
will be assessed, regardless of relationship to the study treatment.  
 
16.32 Progression- Free Survival (PFS):  Defined as the time from registration to the 
first of either death due to any cause or progression.  The distribution of PFS will be estimated usin g the method of Kaplan- Meier . 
 
16.33 Overall Survival:  Defined as the time from registration to death due t o any 
cause.  The distribution of survival time will be estimated usin g the method of 
Kaplan -Meier .  Special attention will be paid to any registered patient who dies 
early (i.e., within 60 days) of initiating their treatment.  Circumstances 
surrounding such early deaths will be classified as being either due to malignant disease, toxicity, other causes, or of unknown reasons. 
16.4 Laboratory Correlative Studies (all done by Cohort) :  All analyses with respect to the 
translational component of this study are intended to be hypothesis-generating and 
descriptive in manner.  Clinical data (i.e. CR rates confirmed response rates, PFS, OS, 
etc.) will be correlated with tumor marker data of interest (CD8+, PD -L1, PD -L2, T cell 
functional capacity  markers, anti -thyroglobulin antibody level s, tumor mutation status , 
and other markers).  The Chi- Square (or Fisher’s Exact test) will be used to assess the 
association of categorical clinical data with categorical biomarker data.  Time- to-event 
clinical data (PFS, OS) will be correlated with biomarker data using Kaplan -Meier 
methodology and Cox regression models.  Logistic regression models will also be used to 
predict binary clinical data with baselin e biomarker data.  Finally, graphical methods and 
descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data as well.  Two -sided p- values < 
0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  
 
 16.5 Adverse Event Stopping Rule: 
 
     
ACCRU- ITOG -1504                                                  76                                            Addendum 6 
  16.51 Monitoring : The principal investigator and the study statistician will review the 
study periodically (at least twice a year) to identify accrual, toxicity, and any 
endpoint problems that might be developing.  The trial is monitored continually 
by the study team who are not ified of every grade 4 and 5 event in real time. The 
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is 
responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC Stati stical Office.  
 
16.52 Adverse Event Stopping Rule :  The stopping rule specified below is based on the 
knowledge available at study development. We note that the Adverse Event Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re-opening to 
accrual after any temporary suspension or (2) at any time during the conduct of 
the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the 
adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The study team may 
also choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that 
have not crossed the specified rule below.   We expect  approximately 10% of 
patients to experience grade 4+ adverse events (at least possibly related to study medication).  In this study, we will suspend accrual to allow for a full review of the data, if any of the following occur in each cohort separately: 
• If at any time, 3 of the initial 10 patients (or 30% of all patients when accrual 
is greater than 10) have experienced any grade 4 adverse event (at least possibly related to the study medication).  
 
• If at any time, 1 of the initial 10 patients (or 10% of all patients when accrual 
is greater than 10) have  experienced any grade 5 adverse event (at least 
possibly related to the study medication).   
 
  16.6  Accrual Monitoring Stopping Rule 
Given the expected accrual rate is around 3 patients per month, it is expected that the 
study will take around 20  months to fully accrue.  We plan to monitor the accrual 
continually and if we only end up accruing 5 patients or less in the first year (after study 
activation), we will consider stopping the trial for slow accrual.   
 
  16.7 Primary Endpoint Completion Time Estimation (For clinicaltrails.gov reporting): 
The primary endpoint is the complete response (CR) rate for Cohort 1 and the confirmed 
response rate for Cohort 2. The final analysis is expected to take place around 36  months 
after the study begins, so we expect the primary endpoint completion time to be around 
36 months after study activation.    
  16.8 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
 
This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, gender, or ethnic origin.  There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this 
regimen in subsets defined by race, gender, or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect 
such differences to exist.  Based on prior studies involving similar dise ase sites, we 
expect about 10 % of patients will be classified as minorities by race and about 50% of 
patients to be women.  Expected sizes of racial by gender subsets are shown in the following table:

  * Collection of this tissue is optional for research purposes. If a patient is not willing to undergo this procedure, it does not cause the patient to be ineligible; however, collection of this tissue is strongly 
encouraged (anticipate collecting samples from 20 of 30 patients in Cohort 1). † See separate lab manual for detailed instructions.  
 
17.2 Paraffin Embedded Tissue Blocks/Slides and Frozen Biopsy Samples 
 
17.21 Submit one formalin fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block with 
largest amount of invasive tumor (at least 1 cm of tumor for cases of surgical 
resection) from the original surgery (Cohorts 1 and 2) .  In addition, if available, 
submit one FFPE bl ock containing tumor -involved lymph node. Preferably, 
chose a lymph node with gross tumor involvement. An H&E slide will be generated  from all FFPE samples at the lead study site, which is responsible for 
correlative studies, to permit quality assessment of each tissue block.  Once the QA is completed, and the necessary slides are cut, the tissue block will be 
returned. If tissue blocks cannot be released, prepare 30 slides for each tissue 
using the provided slides in the kit for each patient ( See Laboratory Manual ). 
Slides should not be baked since these tissues will be used for molecular studies.  
Slides should be shipped with 24 hours of tissue cutting.  
 
17.22 A core biopsy  will be performed  after the patient is registered onto the study, but 
prior to the start of treatment from 20 patients in Cohort 1(see separate lab manual). Four passes will be obtained  from tumor tissue in, but not limited to the 
neck, chest abdomen, pel vis, bone or extremities . The  first two passes will be 
formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE). The second  two passes will be 
preserved in RNA later ® for future molecular analysis. An H&E slide will be 
generated  from all samples  at the University of Col orado, responsible for 
correlative studies, to permit quality assessment of the biopsies . (See Laboratory 
Manual) 
 17.23 The following materials below are mandatory (unless indicated otherwise) and 
required for shipment:  
• Paraffin embedded tissue blocks preferred  (OR 30 four- micron  unstained 
slides from primary tumor and involved lymph node ).  
• Specimen Submission: Tissue form  
• Surgical Pathology Report 
• Operative Report  (optional) 
  Note: Please include the ACCRU patient ID number on all materials li sted 
above.  
 
17.24 The block/slides must be appropriately packed and shipped to prevent damage (see Appendix IV ). 
 17.25 Tissue specimens must be shipped ≤ 60 days after registration.  
 17.26 Verify that the appropriate sections of the  Archival FFPE Tissue Submission 
Form and/or Biopsy Specimen Acquisition Tracking Form are completed and 
filled in correctly. (These forms are located on the ACCRU web site in the “Manuals & Forms” folder.)

  17.3 Study Methodology and Storage Information  
 
17.31 Submitted tissue samples will be analyzed as detailed in Section 2.3. DNA 
extraction and storage of DNA for future pharmacogenetic assays (e.g., for 
genetic polymorphisms such as  BRAFV600E, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, mutation 
burden, etc., that  may correlate with efficacy and tolerability.    DNA will be 
isolated from 30 FFPE primary tumor samples and 20 core biopsy frozen samples from progressive tumors (Cohort 1).  To broadly investigate m echanisms of 
response and resistance to combination therapy, we plan to generate gene expression profiles from the frozen biopsies (n=20) for analysis by RNA -Seq. 
Total RNA will be isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and 500ng of RNA will 
be submitted to  our Genomics and Microarray core facility for mRNA -seq library 
construction (TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Kit, Illumina). We aim to collect at least 20 pre- treatment biopsies, depending upon tumor accessibility and patient 
consent. In parallel, we will al so analyze the 30 FFPE primary tumor samples by 
RNA- Seq
51. RNA will be generated from FFPE tissue sections (Qiagen FFPE 
All-Prep kit) and 100ng will be submitted for library construction (TruSeq 
Stranded RNA Access mRNA Library Kit, Illumina). We plan to sequence 60 -80 
million 1x125bp (FFPE) or 2x125bp (frozen) reads per sample.  DNA and RNA 
will be analyzed for mutations using whole -exome sequencing technology in the 
University of Colorado Cancer Center Gene Expression Core facility led by  
  Remaining DNA and RNA will be stored frozen at   - 80ºC at the 
University of Colorado, according to patient consent information (see Section  
6.12) unt il specific analyses are identified.  As protocols are developed, they will 
be presented for ACCRU, ITOG, and IRB review and approval.   (This collection 
is part of a general strategy of investigation for the majority of ACCRU studies. 
 
17.32 At the complet ion of the study, any unused/remaining material will be stored in 
the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus  for future research 
according to the patient consent permission (see Section 6.15).  Potential future research may include immunohistochemi stry (IHC) analyses to analyze 
predictive biomarkers, changes in expression pattern with therapy, and correlation with response and/or adverse events.  When a protocol is developed, it will be presented for ACCRU, ITOG and IRB review and approval. 
 
17.4 Return of Genetic Testing Research Results  
 
Because the results generated by the genetic testing included in this section are not currently anticipated to have clinical relevance to the patient or their family members, the genetic results will not be disc losed to the patients or their physicians. 
 If, at any time, genetic results are obtained that may have clinical relevance, IRB review 
and approval will be sought regarding the most appropriate manner of disclosure and 
whether or not validation in a CLIA certified setting will be required. Sharing of research 
data with individual patients should only occur when data have been validated by 
multiple studies and testing has been done in CLIA-approved laboratories.

  Combination Targeted Therapy with Pembrolizumab 
and Lenvatinib in Progressive, Radioiodine-Refractory 
Differentiated Thyroid Cancers: A Phase II Study  
 
This is an important form.  Please read it carefully.  It tells you what you need to know about this research study.  If you agree to take part in this study, you need to sign this form.  Your signature means that you have been told about the study and what the risks are.  Your signature on this form also means that you want to take part in this study. 
 
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study.  Your study doctor will explain the clinical trial to you.   Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about taking part.  You may discuss your decision with your friends and family.  You can also discuss it with  your health care team.  If you have any questions, you can 
ask your study doctor for more explanation.   You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have differentiated thyroid cancer that has spread and has not responded to treatment with radioactive iodine.  
Why is this research study being done?  
 The purpose of this research study is to determine  any good and bad effects of using lenvatinib 
alone, or lenvatinib along with pembrolizumab. The study will allow researchers to see if there is any benefit to adding pembrolizumab to the standard treatment (lenvatinib). 
 
 
How many people wil l take part in the research study?  
 This study has two study groups, and each group will have about 25 patients. 
 
Group 1 includes people who have never received treatment with lenvatinib. These people will 
take 20 mg of lenvatinib by mouth, and receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab through an IV once every 21 days. 
 
Group 2 includes people who are already taking lenvatinib but their cancer has continued to 
spread.  These people will continue taking (or re- start) the lenvatinib at the same dose they had 
been taking, and will be given 200 mg of pembrolizumab through a needle in your arm (IV infusion) once every 21 days in addition to lenvatinib. 
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study?  
 
Before you begin the study …   
 You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study.  These exams, t ests or procedures are part of regu lar cancer care and may be done even if 
you do not join the study.  If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your study doctor.

• Medical history and physical exam, including  pulse, blood pressure, height, weight and 
an assessment of how well you perform routine activities of daily living. 
• Routine blood tests. About 2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn. 
• A blood sample for research tests is required for this study. Before treatment starts, the research blood sample will be taken at the same time as the routine blood samples by drawing some blood from a vein. About 3 additional teaspoons of blood will be drawn. 
• Urine test  
• A pregnancy test done either by providing a urine sample or by taking a blood sample from a vein in your arm within 7 days of being registered on the study (if you are a woman of childbearing potential). Your study doctor will discuss these options with you. 
• A measurement and evaluation of your tumor by MRI and/or CT scan.  
• An echocardiogram and electrocardiogram to look at your heart and heart valves to see how well they are working. 
• A check to see if any of the side effects that may be caused by the study drugs are already present. 
 
During the study   
 If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will need the following tests and procedures.  They are part of regular cancer care.   
• Medical history and physical exam, including  pulse, blood pressure, height, weight and an assessment of how well you perform activities of daily living. 
• Routine blood tests. About 2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn. 
• Urine test.  
• A MRI and/or CT scan to measure and evaluate your tumor, and to find out if your 
disease is progressing. 
• An echocardiogram and electrocardiogram to look at your heart and heart valves to see 
how well they are working. 
 You will need these tests and procedures that are part of regular cancer care.   They a re 
being done more often because you are in this study.   
 
• A check to see if you are having any of the side effects that may be caused by the study drugs. 
• Routine blood tests. About 2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn. 
• Urine test.  
• An echocardiogram and electrocardiogram to look at your heart and heart valves to see how well they are working.

  Addendum 6 
  You will need these tests and procedures that are either being tested in this study or being 
done to see how the study is affecting your body.  
• A blood sample for research tests is required for this study. Before treatment starts, the research blood sample will be taken at the same time as the routine blood samples by drawing some blood from a vein. About 3 additional teaspoons of blood will be dr awn.  
• Mandatory tumor tissue submission: This study also includes research tests that will be 
performed on tumor tissue samples that you will provide. These samples should be 
tissues that were obtained from previous surgeries or biopsies; no additional tumor tissue 
will be taken from you during this study.  
• A check to see if you are having any of the side effects that may be caused by the study 
drugs. 
• Routine blood tests. About 2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn. 
• Urine test.  
• An echocardiogram and electrocardiogram to look at your heart and heart valves to see 
how well they are working. 
• If you are in Group 1: An additional optional  biopsy of your current tumor tissue may  
be performed.  The biopsies will be performed by specialists at your facility w ho are 
trained to do these biopsies. The specific procedure to be performed will depend on the site of your tumor.  The specific details and risks of the specific procedures will be explained to you by the specialist who will perform the biopsy. The specia list will use an 
ultrasound or CT scan to help them take the biopsy. Before the sample  is taken , you will 
be given some medicine to numb the area.  A small cut will be made in your skin and the 
sample will be taken by pressing a hollow needle into your tumor.  When we take the needle out, it will remove a small circle of tumor tissue called a “plug.”   A total of four 
“plugs” will be taken.
 
 
Some of the research tests done on the research blood and tissue samples are genetic tests. Because these genetic test s are not used for regular medical care, neither you nor your doctor 
will be told the results of the test(s).  The test results will not be put in your medical record either.  
 There is more information about these research tests near  the end of this form. 
 You will be asked to keep a daily record of when you take the study medication (Patient Medication Diary), and every day write down the day and time you take the medication. If you notice any side effects, you can include this information in the Comments section of the diary. You will be asked to bring the medication diary each time you see your doctor. 
 
You will also be asked to check your blood pressure three times every week, and record it on the Blood Pressure Diary. If you do not already have a blood pressure monitor, one will be provided to you.  You will be asked to bring the Blood Pressure Diary each time you see your doctor.

  How long will I be in the research study?  
 
You will be asked to take the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab until your disease gets worse, you choose to withdraw from the study, or your doctor  indicates you should discontinue the study, for a maximum of 24 months (on treatment) .  After you are finished 
ACCRU- ITOG -1504  Appendix I 
  Page 15 of 28 
  Addendum 6 
  taking the combination of  lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, the study doctor will ask you to visit 
the office for follow -up exams every 12 weeks unless and until your disease gets worse, for a 
maximum of  up to5 years.    
 
Can I stop being in the research study?  
 
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop.  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from taking the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab can  be evaluated by your doctor.  Another 
reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you.  The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest, if you do not follow the study rules , or if the study is stopped. 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the research study?  
 You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious.  Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side eff ects.  Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking the combination of 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may 
never go away.   
 There also is a risk of death.  
 You should talk to your study do ctor about any side effects that you have while taking part 
in the study.

 Reproductive risks:  You should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby.  Women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study.  It is important you understand that you need to use birth control while on this study.  Check with your health care provider about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them.  Some methods might not be approved for use in this study.   [Note to Local Investigators: Include a statement about possible sterility when appropriate.  For example, “Some of the drugs used in the study may make you unable to have children in the future.”  If appropriate include a statement that pregnancy testing may be required.]  For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.  
Are there benefits to taking part in the research study?  
 Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better.  While doctors hope the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab will be more useful against cancer compared to the usual treatment, there is no proof of this yet.  We do know that the information from this study will help doctors learn more about the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab as a treatment for cancer.  This information could help future cancer patients.  
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this research study?  
 You do not have to be in this study to receive treatment for your cancer.

Your other choices may include: 
• Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study 
• Taking part in another study, if one is available 
• Getting no treatment  
• Getting comfort care, also called palliative care.  This type of care helps reduce pain, tiredness, appetite problems and other problems caused by the cancer.  It does not treat the cancer directly, but instead tries to improve how you feel.  Comfort care tries to keep you as active and comfortable as possible.   
 Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.

on your care.

The choice to let us keep the leftover tissue and/or blood for future research is up to you.  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  
If you decide now that your leftover  tissue  and/or blood can be kept for research, you can change 
your mind at any time.  Just contact us and let us know that you do not want us to use your tissue 
and/or blood; then any tissue and/or blood that remains will no longer be used for research.  
In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health.  While 
ACCRU/ITOG may give them reports about your health, it will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are.  
Sometimes tissue  and/or blood are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in 
families).  Even if your tissue and/or blood is used for this kind of research, the results will not 
be put in your health records.

  Addendum 6 
  Your leftover tissue  and/or blood will be used only for research and will not be sold.  The 
research done with your leftover  tissue  and/or blood may help to develop new products in the 
future.  
Benefits  
The benefits of research using tissue and blood include learning more about what causes cancer 
and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them.  
Risks  
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records.  We will do our 
best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private.  The chance that this 
information will be given to someone else is very small.  
Making Your Choice  
Please read each sentence below and thin k about your choice.  After reading each sentence, 
circle "Yes" or "No".  If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse, or call our 
research review board at the IRB's phone number.

  Addendum 6 
  The sample(s) will be the property of ACCRU/ITOG.  Outside researchers may one day ask for a 
part of your sample(s) for studies now or future studies.  
How do outside researchers get the sample?  
Researchers from universities, hospitals, and other health organizations do research using blood 
and tissue .  They may call ACCRU and ask for samples for their studies.  ACCRU looks at the 
way that these studies will be done, and decides if any of the samples can be used.  ACCRU 
sends the  samples and some information about you to the researcher.  ACCRU will not send your 
name, address, phone number, social security number, or any other identifying information to the researcher.  If you allow your sample(s) to be given to outside researchers, it will be given to them with a code number.  If researchers outside ACCRU use the s ample(s) for future research, 
they will decide if you will be contacted and, if so, they would have to contact the researchers at ACCRU.  Then ACCRU will contact the clinic where you registered for this study, who will contact you.  Please read the following statements and mark your choice:  I permit ACCRU/ITOG to give my tissue sample(s) to outside researchers:

  PATIENT’S BLOOD PRESSURE DIARY  
Today’s date ________________________________ 
Patient Name___________________________( initials acceptable)    Study  Number  __________________ 
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PATIENT:  
 
1.   Your blood pressure readings have two numbers.  The first number is the pressure in your blood vessels during a 
heartbeat  (systolic), and the second number is the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests in between beats 
(diastolic).  These numbers are usually written with a slash in between them (for example, 110/85). 
2. Record the date, then record your blood pressure.  Your blood pressure should be monitored and recorded at least 
three times every week during  therap y (for example, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays). You should take your 
blood pressure after you have been sitting at rest for 5 minutes.  Do not cross your legs. 
3. Normal blood pressure is usually about 120/80 mmHg.  If your systolic pressure is greater than 160 and/or your 
diastolic blood pressure is greater than 100 please rest for 15 - 20 minutes and then recheck your blood pressure.  
After resting, if your systolic pressure is still greater than 160 and/ or your diastolic blood pressure is still greate r 
than 100 , please contact your doctor’s office at _______________________________ for instructions. 
4. Please bring this form to every clinic visit or appointment.

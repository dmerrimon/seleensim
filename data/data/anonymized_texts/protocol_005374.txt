Health Systems IncJustification:  We are aiming to include participants 
who can benefit from the treatment to reduce postoperative 
pain at home and have seen that there is a time lag in pain 
which potentially increases after discharge. Therefore, we are 
amending the final inclusion criteria from Postop pain VAS ≥ 5 
in PACU, where analgesia can still be in effect, to VAS >0 postop 
which will better capture the population of interest. 
2)  Revising the subject demographics questionnaire
Justification: We have added 'Procedure to be Performed, 
Physician performing procedure, Tissue to be Operated On and 
Additional procedure details (such as splints, etc.)' to the 
demographic form to capture additional information that will 
allow us to segment results of the primary endpoint of acute 
change in peak postoperative pain
3)  Updated Post-op timelines day 7 and day 14 to allow follow-
up up to 21 post-surgeries to accommodate change in patient 
and clinic scheduling that occur for varying reasons 
4) Updated Study Population to expand scope to include 
patients electing for functional nasal surgery, common among 
patients requiring functional rhinoplasty or reconstructive 
surgery  
5) Rephrasing Compensation language 
V1.1 1.17.2024 Increased recruitment numbers from 100 to 130.
Justification: due to high drop-out rate post randomization; 
there is the need to increase the recruitment numbers to reach 
the target of 60 completed participants.

Health Systems Inc1.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
The opioid epidemic is driven by opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose. 10.3 million people misused 
prescription opioids in 20181.  There are over 1 million sinus surgeries in US every year and the majority 
of sinus surgery patients are given opioid medications to treat postoperative pain.  Otolaryngologists have 
become more vigilant in their prescription practices, however, non-opioid pain management solutions are 
needed to further reduce dependence on opioid drugs. Strategies to avoid or minimize opioid 
consumption while effectively managing patient pain are of the utmost importance. Furthermore, patient 
apprehension over the pain experienced during postoperative debridements often negatively impacts 
patient adherence to postoperative visits. Several non-opioid alternative medications have proven 
efficacious in postoperative pain management following a variety of otolaryngology surgeries. Non-
medication alternatives, such as pain management devices, remain uncharted territory. Tivic Health 
previously developed and received FDA clearance for ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief, a non-invasive 
microcurrent emitting device applied to the face.  ClearUP was found to be safe and highly effective at 
reducing facial pain.  In the current study, we use the same form factor for ClearUP with minor 
modifications to the waveform emitted by the device to assess its feasibility for use at home in treating 
post-operative pain after sinus surgery. The microcurrent study device has yielded auspicious results in a 
pilot studies examining its ability to reduce postoperative pain following functional endoscopic sinus 
surgery (FESS). We hypothesize that daily use of the self-administered, handheld, microcurrent study 
device will reduce patients’ pain levels following functional nasal or sinus surgery, thereby lowering the 
need for analgesic medications.

2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY DEVICE
The study device is a handheld micro-current TENS emitter intended to be used for the relief of 
postoperative pain after functional nasal or sinus surgery .  The device uses an average current that is 
several orders of magnitude smaller than that of TENS devices used in the facial area. The design of the 
study device was optimized to provide transcutaneous nerve stimulation to the regional areas associated 
with the sinuses.
The pear-shaped device is held in the hand, with the rounded tip of the device applied to the facial skin in 
the region of skin overlying the sinus passages for 5 minutes per treatment. The tip is the active electrode 
of a monopolar design. The housing of the device serves as the return electrode. The hand holding the 
device completes the electrical path. 
When the user turns the device on and presses the tip to the skin, the device lights up and initiates a low-
frequency, pulsed AC circuit that is maintained at a constant current. The device uses the current to 
calculate the impedance in the path between the tissue at the tip and the hand in contact with the device. 
If the calculated impedance is above an impedance threshold, the device is in “Detection” mode. 
Conversely, when the impedance falls below the impedance threshold, the device enters a “Treatment”

Health Systems Incmode. The impedance threshold is calculated dynamically by an adaptive algorithm that incorporates the 
measured parameters of the individual user.
The user is instructed to glide the tip of the device along the skin along the cheek, nose and under brow 
bone. When a low-impedance point is detected, the device signals the user via a slight haptic (vibration) 
feedback. The user is instructed to hold the device in place until the Treatment period has passed as 
indicated by cessation of the haptic indicator.
Once the Treatment period ends, the device resets to Detection mode. The user is instructed to glide the 
device along an indicated path until reaching the next low-impedance area.
The user may adjust the current setting of the device (low, medium, high) if they prefer more or less 
current intensity. The default setting for the device is low.
The study device emits a 14.7 Hz frequency and has previously shown to be safe and well-tolerated in an 
IRB-approved 4 person pilot feasibility study. The study device is configured to emit alternating current in 
the microampere range, significantly less energy than has been safely used in TENS treatment of the face 
for pain [1-3].

The sham device appears and operates identically to the active device, including indicator lights and haptic 
vibration, however it emits a weak direct current that is non-therapeutic.

level, other past medical history
In their final preoperative visit, subjects will complete the Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT22) and a 
modified version of the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE). Patients will be instructed by 
study staff on how to correctly self-administer the device to the periorbital skin. Subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of two groups and given either an active study device or a sham device 
that appears identical to the active device while emitting no therapeutic microcurrent. These devices will 
be labeled “A” or “B” depending on the group randomization. Both groups will be instructed to use the 
device on postoperative days 0-21 and sent home with instructions.
On the day of surgery, standard total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) will be administered for each enrolled 
subject. Standard TIVA is as follows: anesthetic induction will be performed using propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg 
and remifentanil 2-5 mcg/kg, with neuromuscular blockade used to facilitate endotracheal intubation only 
if deemed necessary by the anesthesiologist placing the endotracheal tube (ETT). Anesthesia will be 
maintained using propofol 30-50 mcg/kg/min, remifentanil 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min and nitrous oxide 50-
70% titrated based on hemodynamics to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-70 mmHg. Each subject 
will receive the standard dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone prior to the start of surgery, and 4 
mg ondansetron prior to emergence. Vital signs, anesthetic technique (i.e., bolus and infusion drug totals, 
end tidal gas concentrations, narrative comments), and inputs and outputs for the case will be recorded 
to control hemodynamic differences between subjects. No new imaging will be obtained as part of the 
study. In PACU phase II, subjects will report their visual analog scale (VAS) for pain to confirm eligibility 
for the study.  Subjects will complete their first study device treatment in the PACU phase II and study 
staff will record their VAS for pain before treatment and 10 minutes and 1 hour after treatment. Subjects 
will be instructed to record their VAS for pain at 2 hours and 4 hours after treatment at home.
The day after surgery, subjects will be reminded by staff members via phone to self-administer the 
treatment with the device. Subjects will glide the device over the periorbital skin for 2.5 minutes per side 
of the face (five minutes total) three times every 24 hours for up to V2 or 21 days post-op, whichever 
comes sooner with additional administrations as needed. When in pain, subjects will be instructed to use 
the device and wait ten minutes before using oxycodone 5 mg or acetaminophen 325 mg as rescue pain 
medication if needed. Subjects will complete a daily pain diary (either paper or online via REDCap) 
documenting their pain on a visual analog scale of 0-10 before and 10 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hour, 4 hours 
after treatment.  Subjects will also record the time and dose of all medications used (either paper or online 
via REDCap). The questions asked are as follows:
-How many times did you administer the device today?
-How many acetaminophen 325 mg have you taken in the last 24 hours?
-How many oxycodone 5 mg have you taken in the last 24 hours?

 Subjects will return to clinic for their first two postoperative visits o . On postoperative V1 and V2 subjects 
will complete a modified version of the NOSE questionnaire to quantify changes in congestion and nasal 
obstruction. Post-op V2 subjects will complete the SNOT-22 to capture other sinonasal symptoms. For 
patients undergoing debridement, upon arriving in clinic, subjects will be instructed to record their current 
pain level via VAS in their pain diary before and after they self-administer treatment with the study device. 
They will subsequently record their pain levels during and after the debridement. During the second 
postop visit, subjects will be asked to complete a user experience questionnaire assessing their 
satisfaction with the study device and safety/tolerability. 
Data analysis
All data will be tabulated. The difference between the symptom scores before and after treatment will 
be computed for each individual in the study. Differences in change scores will be compared across 
treatment groups.
An appropriate two-sided statistical test (paired t-test or repeated measure ANOVA) will be used to 
assess the pre and post differences in symptom severity.
STUDY ENDPOINTS 
This study is intended to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of the study device after functional 
nasal or sinus surgery .  The primary endpoint is the acute change in peak postoperative pain score 10 
minutes after treatment.
Auxiliary outcomes include:
Pain at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours after device treatment
Pain before, during, and after debridement (applicable to FESS patients)
Postoperative debridement compliance (applicable to FESS patients)
Self-report of congestion and nasal obstruction severity
Total opioid and/or acetaminophen consumption (the former calculated in oral 
morphine equivalents)
Patient satisfaction 
Safety and tolerability
Direct and indirect cost of pain management as calculated by total medications used 
and number of days missed from usual daily activity
Utilization of additional healthcare resources (including telephone encounters and visits 
to any healthcare provider regarding postoperative pain)

unique study identification number. At the end of the study, all study databases will be de-identified and 
stored for up to 6 years following the completion of the study. 
The original study record will consist of:
▪Subject Demographics Questionnaire
▪Pain Data Sheet(s)
▪Debridement Pain Data Sheet
▪Medication Data Sheet(s)
▪NOSE Data Sheet (Enrollment, Postop V1, Postop V2)
▪SNOT22 Data Sheet (Enrollment, Postop V2)
▪User Experience Questionnaire
Original study records will be filled out manually by study staff and the study patient, where applicable. If 
an entry requires change, the correction will be made as follows:
Draw a single line through the incorrect entry.
Enter data, date, and initial the change (“white-out”, erasure, or any form of obliteration of data is 
not permitted under any circumstances).
All fields must be completed in study records. Blank responses will not be interpreted as “none” or “N/A”.  
If data are not available, a straight line should be drawn through all applicable fields and unused pages, 
dated and initialed to indicate there was no omission.
After completion of the study, the Investigator will provide the Industry Collaborator with deidentified 
digital copies of study databases and the original study record.
Protocol Deviations/Amendments
The Investigator shall not deviate from the protocol without documented approval from the Industry 
Collaborator. Any significant changes or deviations in the protocol will be made as an amendment to the 
protocol and must be approved in writing by the IRB and by the Industry Collaborator prior to being 
implemented.  Unless the Industry Collaborator has consented to any such deviation or change in writing, 
the Industry Collaborator will not assume any resulting responsibility or liability.
Amendments to the protocol will be subject to the same requirements as the original protocol, with the 
exception of administrative amendments. The Industry Collaborator will submit a protocol amendment 
via the Investigator to the IRB for any change in the protocol that significantly affects the safety of subjects 
or scope of the investigation.
Administrative amendments may be made by mutual agreement between the Investigator and the 
Industry Collaborator and will be documented in writing with copies to both the Investigator and the 
Industry Collaborator.

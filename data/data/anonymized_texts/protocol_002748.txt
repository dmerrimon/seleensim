 Protocol  Summary 
 
Title:  Safety  of Simultaneous  versus  Sequential  Administration  of 
mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines and Quadrivalent Inactivated 
Influenza (IIV4) in Adults, Adolescents and Children: A  
Randomized  Observer  Blinded  Study  
Phase:  Phase  IV 
Population:  450 persons  ≥5 years  of age for whom  both COVID -19 and 
influenza vaccines are indicated and for whom COVID -19 
vaccine is recommended  by the ACIP.  
Clinical  Sites:  Three: Duke University (Lead); Johns Hopkins University 
(Contributing);  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  (Contributing)  
Study  Duration:  36 months  total 
• 12 months  to recruit/enroll,  6 months  during  each  of two 
influenza seasons  
5 months  to perform  analysis  and laboratory  assays  after the 
end of follow -up period 
Participant  Duration  and 
Number of Participants:  • 120 days  for 450 total participants  at 3 sites 
Description  of Study 
Procedures:  This study is a prospective, randomized clinical trial. During  
this study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive 
quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) and mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccine either simult aneously or sequentially, 7- 14 
days  apart.  For participants  receiving  their primary  dose series, 
a second dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will be 
administered either 3 to 8 weeks or 4 to 8 weeks following the 
first dose, depending upon the mRNA COVID -19 vacc ine 
provided. Participants receiving a booster dose of mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccine will receive a single COVID -19 dose within 
the study per current CDC guidelines.  
 
Solicited symptoms of reactogenicity will be assessed on 
vaccination day and daily during the 7 days following each 
Vaccination Visit using either electronic or paper symptoms diaries, depending on study participant preference. Quality of 
life data will be  collected using electronic or paper diaries on 
day of Vaccination Visit 1 and daily during the 7 days following 
the visit. Serious  adverse  events  and adverse  events  of special  
interest  will be collected throughout  the duration of the study.

 1 BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background  
 
COVID -19 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is caused by a coronavirus called Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS- CoV-2). COVID -19 was first noted in late 2019 
among clusters of pneumonia cases occurring in  Wuhan China.  The virus spread globally,  in a 
rapid manner,  with the first case  among a  US resident  reported in January  20201. On March  11, 
the World Health  Organization declared COVID -19 a pandemic2. During  the course of 2020  and 
2021, the pandemic occurred in multiple distinct waves in the US, with the most recent wave 
starting in late 2021 and  persisting into early 2022. As of April 3rd, 2022, over 79 million COVID - 
19 cases and over 950,000 deaths have been reported in the United States3, making this the 
worst pandemic to occur in this country since the 1918 Spanish flu. With the emergence of 
numerous viral variants including the B1.1.529 Omicron variant and B.1.617.2 Delta variant  in 
addition to other variants being monitored, the current trajectory of the pandemic remains 
uncertain 4. 
 
Typical symptoms of COVID -19 include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, myalgia, body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion,  runny  nose,  nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea.  Complications  of COVID -19 are varied 
and include pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute liver, kidney and/or cardiac injury, secondary infections, septic shock, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, blood clots, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and 
adults, rhabdomyolysis and neurologic symptoms. Among known risk factors for severe illness 
are advanced age, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Down syndrome, obesity, serious heart conditions (heart failure, coronary artery disease or 
cardiomyopathies), immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, sickle cell disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking and pregnancy 
5. 
 
 
Influenza 
Epidemic influenza is a highl y infectious disease  that occurs  annually  throughout the  temperate 
regions  in both hemispheres  in their respective winter  months  6. Influenza infection occurs in all 
age groups and is a major public health threat, as it has the ability to spread rapidly through populations and affect a large number of people. While infection rates are generally highest 
among school age children, the highest rates of serious morbidity and mortality occur among 
individuals over 65 years of age and in children less than 1 year of age 
7. Underlying medical 
conditions such as chronic cardiac, pulmonary, kidney and metabolic disorders, and various types of immunosuppression increase the likelihood of potential complicat ions
8. 
 
Uncomplicated influenza illness  is characterized by the abrupt  onset  of constitutional  symptoms 
including:  fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis.  
Influenza virus  infection can also lead to more  serious  illness  such as primary  viral pneumonia 
and exacerbation of underlying medical conditions. Common complications include bacterial 
pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis media. The estimated annual number of influenza- associated 
hospitalizations in the United States is  226,000  and the  estimated  annual number of deaths is  
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
11  
 34,470 9,10. Hospitalizations  due to influenza are typically  more  prevalent  in seasons  during 
which A( H3N2 ) subtype predominates.  
 
COVID -19 and Influenza  
 
In the spring  of 2020  COVID -19 emerged late in the course of the 2019 -2020 seasonal  influenza 
epidemic, with co- infection being reported in some individuals11. Of potential concern, was the 
possibility of a simultaneous surge in both COVID -19 cases and influenza cases during the 
2020- 2021 season.  However, influenza activity in the United States during the 2020- 2021 
season remained relatively low and to date has remained relatively low during the 2021- 22 
season. If both COVID -19 and influenza infections peaked simultaneously during subsequent 
seasons, there could be a significant future impact on utilization of health care resources 
potentially overburdening the health care system.  
 
 
COVID -19 Vaccines 
 
The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 vaccine (BNT162b2) (marketed as Comirnaty) received FDA - 
licensure for individuals 16 years and older on August 23rd, 2021 for primary dose series. The 
Moderna COVID -19 vaccine (marketed as Spikevax) received FDA approval on January 31st, 
2022 for individuals 18 years and older for primary dose series. Numerous other COVID -19 
vaccines are currently in different phases of preclinical and clinical development. Six vaccines 
have recently completed or are currently undergoing late stage Phase 3 clinical testing in the 
United States including the two mRNA vaccines, two viral vectored vaccines, and two 
adjuvanted recombinant protein- based vaccines12. Prior to approval, the Moderna mRNA 
vaccine (mRNA -1273) received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) for persons 18 years of age and older13, and the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID - 
19 vaccine received an initial EUA in December  2020 for persons  16 years  of age  and older  and 
expanded its EUA to include individuals  12 -15 years  of age on May 10, 2021 and individuals  5 - 
11 years of age  on October 29, 202114. Both Pfizer -BioNTech  and Moderna vaccines are based 
on the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) antigen encoded by RNA and formulated in lipid 
nanoparticles  (LNPs).  Among study  participants  without evidence o f SARS- CoV-2 infection,  the 
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2) was 95.0% (95% CI 90.3%, 97.6%) effective at 
preventing confirmed COVID- 19 occurring at least 7 days after the second dose of vaccine 15. 
The Moderna vaccine (mRN A-1273)  demonstrated  a vaccine efficacy  of 94.1%  (95%  CI 89.3%, 
96.8%) for the prevention of symptomatic SARS- COV -2 infection with onset at least 14 days 
after the second injection, with 11 COVID -19 cases in the vaccine group and 185 COVID- 19 
cases in the placebo group 16. The Janssen adenovirus 26 vectored COVID -19 vaccine (Ad26 
COV2.S) received EUA from the FDA on February 27, 2021 but due to being a viral vector 
vaccine it will not be further addressed by  this study evaluat ing the simultaneous administration 
of influenza and mRNA COVID -19 vaccines.  
 
BNT162b2 is currently authorized under the FDA EUA for persons 5 – 15 years of age and 
approved for persons 16 years of age and older, while the mRNA -1273 is approved for persons  
18 years of age and older.  CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has 
recommended  use of these  vaccines,  according to the specifications  in the EUAs;  CDC has also 
published interim clinical considerations for use of COVID -19 vaccines17,18. Both vaccines are 
administered intramuscularly with the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine (30 µg, 0.3mL each for persons  
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
12  
 ≥ 12 years of age and 10 µg, 0.2mL each for persons 5- 11 years of age) being administered 21 
days  apart  and the Moderna vaccine (100 µg, 0.5mL  each)  being administered 28 days  apart as 
a primary series in particular, for populations that include moderately or severely 
immunocompromised, adults over 65  years of age and  those who need rapid protection against 
COVID -19. Doses  should not be administered  earlier than  recommended but if  given within a 4- 
day period prior to the scheduled time may be considered valid.  The second dose can be 
administered between 3 and 8 weeks after the first dose for the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine and 
between 4 and 8 weeks after the first dose for the Moderna vaccine. The vaccines are not considered to be interchangeable, however under extenuating circumstances such  as when the 
brand of the first dose of vaccine is unknown, any mRNA COVID -19 vaccine may be 
administered 28 days following the first dose
17. 
 
On August 12, 2021, the FDA amended the Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID- 19 
vaccine EUAs to include the use of a third dose of vaccine in specific immunocompromised 
populations for persons 12 years of age and older and persons 18 years of age or older for the respective vaccines.
19 Additionally, the CDC also recommended that moderate or severely 
immune compromised populations receive an additional third dose of the mRNA COVID -19 
vaccines to enhance the immune response20. Subsequent to these actions, the U.S. 
government has expanded authorizations and recommendations for a third dose of COVID -19 
vaccine as infections rose from the coronavirus Delta variant and then the Omicron variant, citing data indicating diminishing protection from the vaccines over time.  The FDA initially 
authorized a booster dose for both Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines 
for all persons  18 years  of age  and older  on November  19, 2021.  Subsequent  to this action,  the 
EUA was extended for the Pfizer -BioNTech mRNA COVID -19 vaccine to include 16- 17 year 
olds on December 9, 2021 and 12 -15 year olds on January 3, 2022.  The CDC has made 
comparable recommendations to  follow the EUAs
21-24. Both the EUA and recommendations for 
the interval between the primary series and booster dose have also been shorted to 5 months. 
On March 29, 2022 FDA authorized a second booster dose for persons aged 50 and older and 
certain immunocompromised individuals; CDC updated guidance for second booster doses,  
with a 4 -month interval between a first and second booster dose13,17. 
 
Local  and systemic side effects  occurring within  the week after  vaccination as reported  from the 
BNT162b2 Phase2/3 reactogenicity subset are noted in Table 1.  In general, both local and 
systemic side effects were reported more frequently in those who were younger and following 
the second dose of vaccine.

Overall,  the frequency  of any severe systemic event  after Dose  1 was ≤0.9%  or less. After  Dose 
2, severe systemic events had frequencies of <2% with the exception after Dose 2 of fatigue 
(3.8%) and headache (2.0%). Severe fever (>38.9°C to 40.0°C) was reported in the BNT162b2 
group after Dose 1 for 0.2% and after Dose 2 for 0.8% 15. 
 
A higher frequency of unsolicited, non- serious adverse events was reported in the vaccine 
group compared to placebo group and was primarily attributed to local  reactions and systemic 
adverse events in subjects not in the reactogenicity  subset and are consistent with solicited 
reactions/events  reported by reactogenicity  subset  participants  during  the first 7 days  following 
vaccination. In the all -enrolled population of (total N=43,448), the proportions of participants 
who reported at least 1 serious  adverse event  (SAE) during  the time period from Dose  1 to the 
data cutoff date  (November 14, 2020) were 0.6%  in the BNT162b2 vaccine group and 0.5%  in 
the placebo group.  Three SAEs reported in the BNT162 group were considered by the 
investigator as related to vaccine or vaccine administration: shoulder injury, ventricular arrhythmia, and lymphadenopathy.  
 
Local  and systemic side effects  as reported from the mRNA -1273 Phase  3 reactogenicity  subset 
are noted in Table 2 . Similar to the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine, in general, both local and 
systemic side effects were reported more frequently in those who were younger and following 
the second dose of vaccine.

Overall, the frequency of any Grade 3 systemic event after Dose 1 ranged from 2.0 to 2.9% 
depending upon age. After  Dose  2, Grade 3 systemic events  were  reported by 15.7%  in the younger 
group and 2.0% in the older group26 . 
 
The proportion of participants who reported severe unsolicited AEs was 1.4% following any vaccine 
dose (275 participants)  and 1.3%  following any  placebo dose (225 participants).  The most  frequently 
reported severe AEs that occurred in greater numbers of vaccine than placebo recipients were 
headache,  myalgia,  arthralgia,  injection site erythema,  and injection site pain.  The frequency  of non- 
fatal serious  adverse events  was low and without  meaningful  imbalances  between study  arms  (1% in 
the mRNA -1273 group and 1% in the placebo group).

In a study comparing the safety and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents to 
that in adults local and systemic events were generally mild to moderate in severity and were reported at similar frequencies in both age cohorts.  As with adults, systemic events were 
reported more  often  after BNT162b2  dose  2 than after dose 1. The vaccine produced a greater 
immune response in adolescents than adults and was highly effective
27. 
 
A study assessing two 10 µg doses of BNT162b2 in children 5 to 11 years of age each 
administered 3 weeks  apart, showed the vaccine to be safe,  immunogenic  and efficacious  in 
this age group as well.  Solicited injection site and systemic reactions were generally mild to 
moderate and lasted 1 to 2 days.  In general,  systemic events  were  reported  more  commonly 
after the second dose than the first dose.  Fever  occurred  in 8.3%  of recipients  after the first 
and second dose.28 
 
Hypersensitivity  Reactions and mRNA  COVID -19 Vaccines 
In the Pfizer  mRNA  phase III trial, more  participants  reporting hypersensitivity -related adverse 
events in the vaccine group (137 [0.63%]) compared with the placebo group (111 [0.51%]).  
There  were  no anaphylactic  or severe hypersensitivity  reactions  reported (FDA  EUA).  
 
In the Moderna mRNA COVID vaccine phase III trial, more participants reported 
hypersensitivity -related adverse events in the vaccine group 1.5% of vaccine recipients (258 
events in 233 participants) compared with the placebo group 1.1% of placebo recipients (185 
events in 166 participants).  There were no anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions 
with close temporal  relation to the vaccine.  There  was one anaphylactic  reaction occurring 63 
days after the second dose of the vaccine that did not meet the Brighton Collaboration Anaphylaxis Case Definition (FDA EUA).

There have been numerous reports of anaphylactic reactions after the Pfizer and Moderna 
vaccine after the start of vaccination campaigns (MMWR January 22, 2021, Vol. 70; MMWR January 15, 2021, Vol. 70).  The update on anaphylaxis reports to VAERS following mRNA 
COVID  Vaccines  through  January  18, 2021 (January  ACIP  meeting),  showed following  results:

The anaphylaxis  reporting  rate (analytic  period Dec 14 – Jan 18) for the Pfizer  mRNA  vaccine is 
4.7 per million  doses  and for Moderna mRNA  vaccine,  2.5 per million  doses29. Both mRNA 
vaccines include a warning that anaphylaxis may occur after mRNA vaccines and that 
appropr iate medical treatment for management must be immediately available30,31. 
 
Myocarditis and Pericarditis and mRNA  COVID -19 Vaccines 
 
Since April 2021, increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the 
United  States  after mRNA  COVID -19 vaccination (Pfizer -BioNTech  and Moderna),  particularly  in 
adolescents and young adults after the second dose32. In June 2021, the FDA updated the 
EUAs for both mRNA COVID -19 vaccines to describe the risk for myocarditis and pericarditis 
after mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines30,31. 
 
While absolute risk  remains small, evidence suggests the risk might be reduced by extending 
the interval between the first and second dose. Studies in adolescents (ages 12- 17 years) and 
adults have shown the small risk of myocarditis associated with mRNA COVID -19 vaccines 
might be reduced and peak antibody responses and vaccine effectiveness may be increased 
with an interval  up to 8 weeks  following the initial dose.  There are currently  no data available for 
children ages 11 years and younger. A 3- or 4-week interval continues  to be the recommended 
interval for people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, adults ages 65 years 
and older, and others who need rapid protection due to increased concern about community 
transmission or risk of severe disease33.

 Booster  Doses 
 
The safety of a booster dose (dose 3) of the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine was assessed in about 
300 adults aged 18 -55 years.  The reactogenicity and safety profile observed after the booster 
dose was generally similar to that observed after Dose 2 of the initial two- dose vaccination 
series.  Lymphadenopathy was more frequent after dose 3 (5.2%), compared with 0.4% in 
persons aged ≥16 years after dose 1 or 2.  Most cases had axillary lymphadenopathy that 
resolved within  5 days  after onset .13,34 The safety  of a booster  (dose 3) of the  Moderna COVID - 
19 vaccine at half the dose (50ug) was assessed in 168 persons over 18 years of age. The 
reactogenicity and safety profile observed after the booster dose was generally similar to that 
observed after Dose  2 of the initial two -dose vaccination series35. FDA  identified no new  safety 
concerns following second booster dose of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine administered to older 
adults13,36. 
 
Influenza and Influenza  Vaccine 
 
Inactivated influenza virus vaccines (IIVs) have been available in the United States for over 50 years and influenza vaccination remains the most effective strategy for reducing the burden of disease caused  by influenza.  In the United  States, vaccination  of all persons  aged  6 months  and 
older is recommended on an annual basis
37. In the 2021- 22 influenza season all influenza 
vaccine formulations  are quadrivalent (IIV4) and contain hemagglutinin (HA) from four prototypic 
influenza types/subtypes that commonly circulate including: influenza A (H1N1pdm09),  
influenza A (H3N2), and 2 different influenza B lineages (B Yamagata and B Victoria) 37. For 
adults 65 years of age and older, who may not develop as robust an immune response as 
younger individuals, both high dose and adjuvanted formulations of IIV4 have been developed. 
High dose and adjuvanted formulations have been shown to be more immunogenic when 
compared  to standard dose  formulations in older  adults8. High-dose influenza vaccine has also 
been shown to be more effective than standard dose influenza vaccine in a randomized clinical 
trial. 
 
 
On the basis  of review of the evidence concerning high-dose  inactivated influenza vaccine (HD- 
IIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), and MF59- adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine 
(aIIV), the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recently modified 
recommendations for influenza vaccination of persons aged ≥65 years38. ACIP now 
recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent  high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine 
(HD- IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted 
inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an 
opportunity  for vaccine administrati on, then any  other  age-appropriate  influenza vaccine should 
be used. Higher dose vaccines include HD- IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose 
of HA antigen per virus than standard- dose vaccines (60 µg for HD -IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, 
compared with 15 µg for standard -dose inactivated vaccines). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza 
vaccine (aIIV4) contains MF59 adjuvant.

Side effects  after an inactivated influenza vaccine may include soreness,  redness  and swelling 
at the injection site, fever, muscle aches, and headache.  There also may be a very small 
increased risk of  Guillain - Barré Syndrome (GBS)  or anaphylaxis after  an inactivated influenza 
vaccine39. 
 
1.2 Summary  and Rational e 
In clinical practice, the FDA approved the Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines 
and granted  an Emergency  Use Authorization for Janssen COVID -19 vaccine in February  2021. 
Hence, vaccines for both COVID -19 and influenza prevention have the potential for being 
administered at the same time seasonal influenza vaccine is available.  In the pre -licensure 
efficacy studies, neither the Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines  were evaluated for 
either safety or immunogenicity when co- administered with a non -COVID -19 vaccine.  The 
Phase 3 trial of the AstraZeneca chimpanzee adenovirus -vectored COVID -19 vaccine did not 
prohibit  influenza vaccination but simultaneous  administratio n was not systematically  evaluated. 
Initial guidance from the CDC stated that COVID -19 vaccines should be given alone with at 
least  14 days  either  before  or after receipt  of any other  vaccines,  including an influenza vaccine, 
because of limited information on the safety and effectiveness of co- administration. Current 
guidance now states that COVID -19 vaccines can be administered on the same day as other 
vaccines but mentions that it is unknown if simultaneous administration will affect 
reactogenicity17,37 ,40. A single study has assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a 3rd dose 
of Moderna’s mRNA COVID -19 vaccine and High -Dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine when 
administered simultaneously to adults 65 years and older. No safety concerns or immune 
interference were observed.41 
 
Due to the potential for severe influenza complications and resulting morbidity and mortality, it 
remains part icularly important that influenza vaccine is encouraged for all persons 6 months of 
age and older without any contraindications.  Likewise, as the pandemic continues and COVID - 
19 vaccines become available it is critically important that their use be encour aged in those 
populations for whom there is an authorization and an ACIP recommendation.  To date, we are 
unaware of any studies evaluating the safety and immune responses following concomitant 
administration of both mRNA COVID -19 and influenza vaccines in a more general population. 
Hence, we aim to study the safety of simultaneous versus sequential administration of mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccine and IIV4.  Participants receiving mRNA COVID -19 vaccines as either 
standard of care or a study  procedure  will be randomized to receive  either  IIV4 or placebo within 
8 hours of their initial dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. Those receiving IIV4 will receive 
placebo 14 days later and those receiving placebo will receive IIV4 14 days later.  
 
We have elected to evaluate the mRNA  COVID -19 vaccines  for evaluations  for three  reasons:  
1) there is greater accumulated experience with using mRNA COVID -19 vaccines in the 
population; 2) the different reactogenicity profiles for the mRNA COVID -19 vaccines as 
compared to the Janssen adenoviral vector COVID -19 vaccine decreases the ability of a single 
small study to address the question of co- administration safety13 and 3) the preferential 
recommendation for the use of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines over the Janss en vaccine for both 
primary and booster vaccination due to concerns related to thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 
syndrome following Janssen COVID -19 vaccine42. In addition,  we hope  to assess the effects  of

15 March 2023  
19  
 pre-existing  COVID -19 antibody  before  vaccination on the occurrence  of vaccine side effects 
and to assess the effects of COVID -19 vaccine administration on IIV4 immunogenicity.  
 
The current protocol allows for inclusion of persons receiving a booster dose of mRNA COVID - 
19 vaccine.  Administration of  booster dose mRNA COVID -19 vaccines to participants who are 
enrolled in this protocol,  will adhere to current  FDA prescribing recommendations  for licensed or 
EUA mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines and to ACIP recommendations for their use as the approvals 
and recommendations are made.  Inclusion of persons receiving a booster dose of COVID -19 
vaccine will  allow  for enhanced recruitment  during the influenza vaccination season  in which  it is 
expected that most adults and many children receiving an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine in this 
study will be receiving a booster dose rather than an initial vaccine two- dose series.

3 STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1 Main study  design 
This study is a prospective, randomized, clinical trial to assess the safety of simultaneous 
versus sequential administration of mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 vaccines in 450 persons  age ≥5 
years enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (Lead Contractor), Johns  Hopkins University 
(Contributing Contractor), and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (Contributing Contractor). Participants will be enrolled in the 2021- 2022 and 2022- 2023 influenza seasons. 
Individuals will be enrolled who have not received t heir influenza vaccine during the influenza 
season during which they are recruited and are either receiving a booster dose of mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccine (for ages booster is authorized and recommended) or are receiving a 
primary two -dose mRNA COVID -19 vaccine s eries (5 years of age or older).  Future mRNA 
COVID vaccines may include SARS -CoV-2 viral variants which may be included in this study if 
authorized or approved by the FDA and recommended by the CDC. Health, demographic and 
health- related quality of life (H RQOL) data will be collected from study participants 12 years of 
age or older  at baseline.  All participants  receiving an mRNA  COVID -19 vaccine  on Day 1 (Visit 
1) will be randomized to receive quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) or placebo.  
Persons aged <65 years will receive standard dose IIV4 (SD -IIV4) or saline placebo injection. 
To qualify for the study, children < 9 years of age must only need to receive a single dose of IIV4 per ACIP recommendations for the 2022- 2023 season.  Persons aged ≥65 years will 
receive high- dose IIV4 (HD -IIV4) or saline placebo injection.  Participants will receive the 
vaccines in an observer -blinded manner on the same day as they receive mRNA COVID -19 
vaccine.  Seven to fourteen days later (Visit 2) those who receiv ed IIV4 at Visit 1 will receive 
placebo and those who received placebo on at Visit 1 will receive IIV4 (SD -IIV4 or HD -IIV4, 
depending upon age).  Participants will then receive a second mRNA COVID -19 vaccine (Visit 
3), if applicable,  and according to the recommended schedule for vaccination for the respective 
mRNA COVID -19 vaccine product used.  
 
With Day 1 serving as the initial day of vaccination, participants will be followed through Day 7 (total  7 days)  for solicited  symptoms  of reactogenicity  as described  in Section 5.4. HRQOL  data 
will be collected during this time period for persons aged ≥ 12 years. Solicited reactogenicity events will also be monitored through Day 7 (total 7 days) following Visit 2 (all participants) and 
Visit 3 (only  those  participants  receiving primary  2-dose COVID -19 vaccine series).  Participants 
will also be followed for 7 days after each vaccination visit for unsolicited adverse events, 
through Day 120 for serious adverse events (SAEs) and thr ough Day 120  for adverse events of 
special interest (AESI), as described in Section 5.4 . 
 
3.2 Laboratory  Studies  
 
3.2.1 Influenza  Hemagglutination Inhibition  Assay 
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
24  
 mRNA COVID -19 vaccine naïve participants will have blood draws on Day 1 (before 
vaccination) and Day 21 (2021- 2022 season) or Day 29 (2022- 2023 season) (Pfizer/BioNTech 
mRNA vaccine) or Day 29 (Moderna mRNA post -IIV4 vaccination to be stored for serum 
hema gglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers.  Those receiving a booster dose of mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccine will have blood draws on Day 1 (before vaccination) and Day 29.  HAI 
antibody titers will be compared between groups receiving COVID -19 and IIV4 simultaneously 
or sequentially for each of the four influenza vaccine strains contained in the respective 
vaccines  for that season.  Participants  will not receive  individual  HAI antibody  titer results;  these 
are not routinely used in clinical practice.  
 
3.2.2 SARS -CoV-2 Antibody  Assay  
3.2.2.1  Qualitative  baseline assessment  
Participants  will have  blood draws  on day 1 (before vaccination)  as noted in 3.2.1  
Serum will be assayed for the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibody using the AdviseDx SARS - 
CoV-2 IgG II assay and the Alinity I SA RS-CoV-2 IgG assay. The assays are intended for use 
as an aid in identifying individuals  with an adaptive immune response  to SARS -CoV-2 indicating 
recent or prior infection. Serologic testing will be completed in periodic batches throughout the course of t he study and  will therefore not be available in real -time or for use in clinical decision-  
making. The current tests described above are allowed under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization during the COVID -19 pandemic. Duke will share participant results with each 
study site as permitted by FDA and CDC. Study sites may share results with participant as 
permitted by FDA, CDC, and local site regulations.  
 
3.2.2.2  Quantitative  SARS- CoV-2 assessments  
Participants  will have blood draws  on Day 1 (before vaccination)  and following each vaccination 
according to schedules outlined in Section 5.1 to be stored for serum COVID -19 neutralization 
assays.  COVID -19 neutralizing antibody titers will be compared between groups receiving 
COVID -19 and IIV4 simultaneously or sequentiall y for each variant tested. Participants will not 
receive individual COVID -19 antibody titer results; these are not routinely used in clinical 
practice.  
 
3.2.3 Future studies  
In addition to the specified analyses described thus far, there may be other tests or as says that 
have yet to be identified that may be important  for interpreting our  study  findings or of  relevance 
to vaccine outcomes.  Additional  laboratory  assays  may test for antibodies  against  other  bacteria 
or viruses, markers of inflammation, or used in research on the health of the participants.  
Specimens banked for use in other studies will be linked to information (including identifying information) that participants provided to the study. Subjec ts/subject’s legally authorized 
representative (LAR)  must agree  to potential  future  use of samples  in order  to be in the study. 
Because it is unknown if future testing will be of any utility, results of future testing will not be 
provided.

4.4 Recruitment  
Potential participants ≥5 years of age will be recruited from several sources at Duke University 
Medical Center (DUMC), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and Cincinnati using varying 
techniques.  Study investigators will enroll at least 450 persons over two i nfluenza seasons 
(2021- 2022  and 2022- 2023).  Approximately  160 will be enrolled at Duke,  160 will be enrolled at 
Johns Hopkins, and 130 at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.  
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
27  
 The general techniques for how subjects will be recruited include the following:  Study staff, 
including PIs and clinical research coordinators will approach patients/patient’s LAR(s) seen 
during clinic visits about the study; notify other health care professionals in their health system 
about the study via letters and flyers f or potential referrals; notify potential subjects/ subject’s 
LAR(s) about the study via study registries and recruitment service programs. More specific 
mechanisms  to DUMC,  JHU,  and Cincinnati  are described below.  In addition,  research staff will 
work with local COVID -19 vaccination clinics to recruit study participants.  
 
At DUMC, we will plan to enroll persons for whom the COVID -19 vaccine is recommended by 
the ACIP.  Duke will plan to work with Duke Employee Health and Wellness (OEHW) to identify 
employees  that have not yet been vaccinated or may require a COVID -19 vaccine booster  dose. 
Duke will then use that list of healthcare workers in an effort to assist with recruitment. In 
addition, Duke will partner with local COVID -19 vaccination clinics and other Duke clinics for 
potential participant referrals.  For the proposed study, we will not enroll long -term care facility 
residents.  These sources are likely to be sufficient, but if not, we will utilize other past 
successful strategies such as a letter campaign to households of older adults and advertising in 
senior citizen newspapers and general local newspapers.  
 
At JHU, we will also enroll people for whom the COVID -19 vaccine is recommended by the 
ACIP. For community outreach, we partner with l ocal broadcast, cable television, and OTT 
(over -the-top) providers to run 15 and 30 second commercials that are IRB -approved under our 
general  screening protocol.  In addition,  the Center  for Immunization Research (CIR)  has its own 
website (https://centerforimmunizationresearch.org/) which includes a “Join A Study” page dedicated to recruitment for upcoming studies. The CIR has also partnered with local 
community organizations to increase awareness of and community involvement in clinical trials 
of coronavirus vaccines. This includes community organizations in the African American 
community as well as the LatinX community. We have Spanish- speaking staff who can enroll 
and consent subjects in Spanish.  
 
The CIR maintains a recruitment tracking system that securely stores contact information for 
previous  study  participants  and others  who have previously  contacted the Center.  CIR staff may 
contact those people who have expressed permission to be contacted for future studies as an 
addit ional recruitment method. In addition to our dedicated recruitment phone line, people can 
contact us directly via our CIR Facebook, Twitter, and website to learn about our studies.  
 
In order to recruit health care workers and other frontline workers, speci fically targeted 
advertisements  will be used in health  care settings to  recruit those  workers. For the 2021 -2022 
season,  in order  to recruit  healthcare  workers,  we may partner  with Occupational  health  so that 
workers are informed of the study at the time o f the annual influenza vaccination.  
 
At Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC),  we will also enroll  persons  for whom 
the COVID -19 vaccine is recommended by the ACIP.  We have been very successful in 
recruiting adults through email advertisements to our employee population. We have over 
16,000 employees, and we have recruited successfully from this population and their friends  
and family members for many trials. We will also reach out to the public vaccination clinic at CCHMC, which  is now vaccinating individuals  ages  5 and over with COVID -19 vaccine.  We may 
recruit pediatric participants with direct outreach to patients scheduled to receive a COVID -19 
vaccine at our Pediatric Primary Care Clinic. In r egard to older adults, we will continue to  
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
28  
 collaborate with our local retirement communities to recruit and enroll older adults. We will not 
enroll long -term care  facility residents for this study. We have successfully enrolled older adults 
for previous  vaccine trials  from our collaborating retirement  community,  Maple Knoll  Village.  We 
believe that these resources will be sufficient, but if not, we will utilize other past successful 
strategies  like our vaccine  trial participant  database and advertisements  in local medical  offices, 
hospitals, and retirement communities.  
 
At all sites, existing patients or their parent(s)/LAR(s) may be approached by phone call.  The 
study will be reviewed with the patient or their parent(s)/LAR(s), and if the patient is interested, 
then initial eligibility screening will take place on the phone following an IRB -approved script.  A 
waiver  of documentation of consent  will be approved from the reviewing IRB  in order  to carry  out 
these screening activities.  
 
4.5 Reasons for and Handling of Withdrawals  
The following  may be reason for study  withdrawal:  
• As deemed necessary  by the principal  investigator  (PI). 
• Subject  or parent(s)/LAR(s)  withdrawal  of consent.  
• Loss  to follow -up. 
• Subject  unable to return  for study  appointments  
• Termination  of the  study  by the sponsor  
 
Subjects  or their parent(s)/LAR(s)  may withdraw  their consent  for study  participation at any time 
and for any reason, without penalty. Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to 
randomization will be replaced. Subjects who withdraw from the study after randomization will 
not be replaced. Data collected before withdrawal will still be used for analysis.  
 
4.6 Termination  of Study  
This study  may be terminated for safety  concerns of the principal  investigators  from the Lead  or 
Contributing sites, CDC, or participating Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).

5.2 Treatment  Assignment  Procedures  
This study  is a prospective,  randomized,  observer -blinded,  clinical trial involving  subjects  aged  
≥5 years  of age who are to receive COVID -19 and IIV4 vaccines.  
 
5.2.1 Randomization 
Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either IIV4 or saline by an unblinded vaccinator 
at Visit 1.  Those receiving IIV4 at visit 1 will receive saline placebo at Visit 2 and those 
receiving saline placebo at Visit 1  will receive IIV4 at Visit 2.  Randomization will be stratified by 
age (5 to < 12 years of age, 12 to < 18 years of age, 18 to <65 years of age, and ≥ 65 years of 
age) and receipt of either a primary two- dose series or any booster dose of mRNA COVID -19 
vaccine (for ages booster is authorized and recommended) using a permuted block 
randomization scheme stratified by Lead and Contributing Sites.  The project statistician will 
generate permuted block randomization schemes which will be uploaded to REDCap. The 
randomization schedule will not  be available to the study staff, so the next randomization 
allocation will not be known before randomization occurs. Following confirmation of study eligibility  criteria  during Visit 1, participant  randomization will be through REDCap  with treatment 
allocation recorded on the unblinded vaccinator CRF. In the event that REDCap is unavailable, 
manual randomization will occur through the use of envelopes. The project statistician will 
prepare 10 envelopes per age group and vaccine series per site (total of 60 per site) that will 
use the same randomization strategy as the primary scheme embedded in REDCap. When an 
unblinded team member is informed of the age group, he/she will pull the next envelope in 
order. In order to capture the allocation per subject, a separate  form in REDCap will be used by 
the unblinded personnel to add the assignment. A log will need to be kept at the site capturing these instances.  
5.3 Data  Collection 
5.3.1 Study  Product  Supply,  Storage,  and Administration 
In order  to ensure  adherence to study  randomization assignment,  age-appropriate,  licensed IIV4 
or saline placebo will be administered as a study procedure. EUA or approved mRNA COVID - 
19 vaccine will be administered either per standard of care or as a study procedure depending 
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
42  
 on the study  site and location. Licensed  SD-IIV4 and HD -IIV4 vaccine (prefilled syringes)  will be 
purchased for study  administration and maintained at the study  sites and stored at 2°C to 8°C in 
a research- specific medication refrigerator. Licensed or EUA COVID -19 vaccine will be stored 
per manufacturer specifications. While research staff maintain daily temperature logs for the 
medication  storage, it is  also monitored 24/7 with alarm activation  if out of  range.  Research staff 
are notified of any alarm activations and have an on- call system in place to report to the 
research center for further investigation. Any potentially compromised vaccine will be quarantined for further disposition based on  site-specific SOPs and investigator assessment.  
A licensed unadjuvanted standard dose egg- based IIV4 will be the designated study product for 
influenza vaccination of persons  less than 65 years  of age
44. Study  sites will wo rk to coordinate 
the brand of  IIV4 administered.  A single administration of IIV4 comprises intramuscular  delivery 
of 0.5mL total volume of the vaccine for persons 5 through 64 years of age.  
Fluzone High- Dose (Sanofi) will be the designated study products for influenza vaccination of 
persons  65 years  of age and older.  A single  administration of HD-IIV4 comprises  intramuscular 
delivery of 0.7mL total volume of the vaccine for adults 65 years of  age and older.  
Sterile normal saline supplied by each site’s respective pharmacy will be used as placebo.  A 
single administration of placebo comprises intramuscular deliver of 0.5 mL total volume of 
normal  saline  for persons 5  through  64 years  of age and 0.7 mL total volume  for those  65 years 
of age and older.  
mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will be administered per FDA and ACIP recommendations for 
administration.  The primary  two-doses  mRNA  COVID -19 vaccine series  will be administered  in 
two doses, approximately 21 to 56 days or 28 to 56 days apart depending upon the FDA or CDC recommendations. The booster dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will be administered 
according to FDA authorization or EUA and ACIP recommendation.  
Vaccine lot number s, dose,  and site of vaccine  administration  will be recorded by research  staff. 
After administration, used study syringes will be disposed of according to standard operating procedure.  
Emergency  management  supplies  including  epinephrine (1:1000)  and trained  staff will be 
available for initial treatment of an allergic reaction, if needed.  
5.3.2 Blinding 
SD-IIV4, HD -IIV4, and/or placebo will be administered to blinded participants in the opposite 
deltoid muscle, to which the mRNA COVID -19 vaccine was administered at Visit 1.  SD-IIV4 or 
HD-IIV4 will be administered by unblinded licensed staff.  In order to keep the participant 
blinded,  the vaccine administrator  will keep  the prefilled  syringes  out of view of the participant  at 
all times and will instruct the participant to turn their head in the opposite direction of the arm in 
which the vaccine is being administered. Similar instructions will be given to any persons 
accompanying the patient in the room.  After administration,  used study syringes will be 
disposed of according to site- specific SOPs.  A licensed provider (MD, DO, NP, PA, RN, LPN), 
who will be trained on treating adverse reactions, will be immediately available at the time of 
vaccine administration along with emerg ency management supplies available for initial 
treatment of an allergic reaction if needed.  Additionally, clinical members of the blinded data 
collection team will be present to assist study subjects.

 5.3.3 Unblinding 
A copy of participant treatmen t assignments will be retained at the site in a REDCap database 
file accessible  only to the unblinded site staff. In the event of an  occurrence  when knowledge of 
the treatment assignment will influence subject’s care, the Principal Investigator may be 
provided with the treatment assignment. The Principal Investigator must contact the Lead Site, 
Duke and document the event with information regarding the reasons for unblinding. After 
discussion with the Lead site, the Principal Investigator may receive the tr eatment assignment 
from the Lead  site or if necessary,  from the on-site secure file by the unblinded staff.  Unblinding 
events should be reported to the CDC.  
All subjects  will be unblinded at the end of study  and informed of whether  they received the 
influenza and COVID vaccines either sequentially or simultaneously.  
 
5.3.4 Incorrect  Dose Administration  
In the event that a participant who is ≥ 65 years of age inadvertently receives standard- dose 
influenza vaccine rather than high -dose influenza vaccine, using shared decision making, they 
will be offered the opportunity to receive the preferred high -dose i nfluenza vaccine a minimum 
of 28 days following the receipt of the standard -dose vaccine. Although there is no current 
recommendation to follow receipt of a standard- dose vaccine by a high -dose vaccine, 
participants will be offered high -dose vaccine to ass ure they achieve optimal protection from 
infection.  A minimum interval of 28 days was chosen based on the routine practice of 
administering two separate standard- doses  influenza  vaccine 28 days  apart  in children  who are 
influenza vaccine naïve. Participant s choosing to receive a subsequent high- dose influenza 
vaccine will be called on Days 3 and 8 following receipt of their vaccine to review for the 
occurrence of any unsolicited adverse events. They will continue to be followed for the 
occurrence of AESIs and SAES as outlined in Section 5.4 below.  
5.4 Reactogenicity and Safety Assessment  
Participants  will be assessed  for any immediate reactogenicity  in a period at least  30 minutes 
after vaccine administration while at the study site.  They will be assessed for the following 
potential systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis related symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, chest 
tightness,  wheezing,  cough,  stridor,  urticarial,  flushing,  nasal  congestion,  dizziness,  syncope, 
diaphoresis, emesis) or other m edical symptoms (e.g., feverishness, chills/shivering, fatigue, 
myalgia, arthralgia, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea).  They will be assessed for any 
potential injection site reactions including pain, tenderness, erythema or induration.  
 
Frequency and occurrence of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity will be assessed daily 
through post -vaccination Day 7 following Visits 1, 2 and 3 (if primary two- dose COVID -19 
vaccine series) using a standard memory aid.  Participants/participant’s LAR(s) will submit this 
information  electronically  on a daily basis. For  participants  unable to submit electronically, paper 
memory aid completion and collection will be acceptable but not preferred. Injection site and 
systemic solicited events will be graded as noted in Tables 8 and 9 45. Participants/participant’s 
LAR(s) will be further queried upon presence of symptoms. Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) 
will be assessed during the first 7 days following each vaccination visit and concomit ant 
medications  will be assessed  from 30 days  prior to Visit 1 through  the study  period.  Serious  AEs 
(SAEs) and new onset of adverse events special interest (AESI) will be assessed through the 
entire period of a subject’s participation (see below). Unsolicited AEs and SAEs will also be 
graded as to whether they are noticeable but do not interfere with activity (Grade 1), interfere

 with some activity but did not need a medical visit or absenteeism (Grade 2), or prevent daily 
activity  and/or  resulted  in medical  visit and/or  absenteeism  (grade  3) or require  an emergency 
room visit or hospitalization (Grade 4).  
At the time of study enrollment, participants/participant’s LAR(s) will be given a thermometer  
and instructed on using the symptom diary to document oral temperatures and post -injection 
symptoms. Beginning on the evening of Study Visits  1, 2 and 3 (if primary two- dose COVID -19 
vaccine series)  (Day  1) following vaccination,  participants/participant’s  LAR(s)  will record  their or 
their child’s oral temperature using the study -supplied thermometer, the occurrence of solicited 
AEs, for the ne xt 7 days (Day 1 – 7). Temperature will be recorded at roughly the same time 
each day. If a temperature ≥ 100.0°F (37.8°C) is recorded, a second measurement will be 
taken. If more than one temperature is taken on the same day, the highest temperature shoul d 
be recorded. Fever will be defined as a measured temperature ≥ 100.4°F (38.0°C).  
Participants/participant’s LAR(s) will be queried during Visits 2, 3, and 4 on any solicited adverse events  following  vaccination.  Injection site reactogenicity  will be assessed separately 
for COVID -19 vaccine and IIV4 or placebo as described in Table 8 .

 During Visits  2, 3, 4 participants/participant’s LAR(s)  will be encouraged  to report  any significant 
adverse events occurring within 7 days of the vaccination visits and during Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 
6 any serious  adverse events  in an open- ended question format, e.g.  “How are you or your child 
doing? Are you or your child having any  medical  or clinical problems?  If so, please tell me about 
them.” Participants/participant’s LAR(s) who report severe solicited or unsolicited adverse events or express any concern about symptoms/unsolicited events will be encouraged to follow 
up with their or their child’s primary care provider. Study staff will assist with coordination of 
referral appointments as necessary. Medical records will be obtained and reviewed for the occurrence of any  adverse events, serious  adverse events or adverse  events of special interest 
throughout the study period.  
Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) will be collected and reported for the 7 days following each 
vaccine visit. Serious  adverse events  (SAEs)  and adverse events  of special  interest  (AESI)  will 
be collected and reported during the entire study period [i.e. from enrollment through 120 days following enrollment]. Unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and AESIs will be graded as follows.  
 
Mild (Grade  1) Moderate  (Grade  2) Severe  (Grade  3) Potentially  Life Threatening

An adverse event  (AE) is  any untoward medical  occurrence  in a patient or  clinical investigation 
subject administered  a pharmaceutical  product  and which  does  not necessarily  have to have  a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  
 
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets  one of the following  conditions:  
• Results  in death  during the period of protocol -defined  surveillance  
• Is life-threatening (defined  as immediate  risk of death at the time of the event)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization or prolonged  hospitalization during  the period of 
protocol -defined surveillance 
• Results  in congenital  anomaly  or birth defect  
• Results  in a persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Any other important  medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening,  or 
require hospitalization,  may be considered  an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical  judgment,  the event  may jeopardize the participant  and may require  medical  or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples  of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm  requi ring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization,  or the development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
An adverse event  of special  interest  (AESI)  includes  the following:  
• COVID -19 illness  
• Multisystem  inflammatory  syndrome  
• Guillain -Barre  syndrome 
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0

47  
 • Allergic  type reactions  (including  anaphylaxis,  hives,  or facial  and limb swelling  occurring 
within 7 days of a vaccination visit)  
• Myocarditis  or pericarditis  
 
5.4.1 Causality  (relatedness)  Assessment  
Study  site investigators  will assess relatedness  to vaccine or study  procedures  (related,  possibly 
related, unlikely related, or not related) for unsolicited AEs, SAEs and AEs of special interest.  
Relatedness determinations of these events will inform IRB reporting and safety monitoring 
(Section 5.4.3 ). Solicited symptoms in Tables 8 and 9 will all be considered to be related to 
vaccine and causality  assessment will not be done for these  events.  The study  investigators  will 
use their clinical judgement to make causality assessments and may consult the Expert Safety Panel or CISA Project for assistance with causality determinations. The final causality 
assessment decisio n is the responsibility of the site PI where the subject was enrolled.  
 
5.4.2 Reporting  of Adverse Events  
COVID -19 vaccine administration will follow site- specific vaccine campaign administration 
guidelines in accordance with current recommendations from the US Food and Drug 
Administration and the Advisory  Committee  on Immunization Practices  (ACIP).  There  are no 
previously published COVID- 19 trials evaluating the concomitant administration of influenza 
vaccine; however, we do not foresee having a significant issue with serious adverse events (SAEs).  
 
SAEs  and unanticipated problems  will be reported  to the CDC a nd all participating  IRBs 
according to institutional requirements.  
 
Adverse events that occur in a  recipient  following COVID -19 vaccination should be reported  to 
CDC’s  Vaccine Adverse Event  Reporting  System  (VAERS).  Vaccination providers  are required 
by the Food and Drug Administration to report the following that occur after COVID- 19 
vaccination under Emergency Use Authorization:  
• Vaccine administration errors  
• Serious  adverse events  
• Cases  of Multisystem  Inflammatory  Syndrome 
• Cases  of COVID -19 that result  in hospitalization or death  
Reporting  is encouraged for any other  clinically  significant  adverse  event  even if it is uncertain 
whether the vaccine caused the event. Information on how to submit a report to VAERS is 
available at https://vaers.hhs.gov  external icon or by calling 1- 800-822-7967.  
5.4.3 Safety  Monitoring  Plan 
As a lead site, Duke  will coordinate an interim  safety  review.  This review  will be performed by a 
panel of vaccine safety experts.  Duke will provide one subject matter expert to serve on the 
safety panel. CDC will appoint two subject matter experts from other CISA sites that are not 
participating in this study. The safety experts will review SAEs and AESI and create an interim 
report.  This review will occur once approximately 100 subjects are enrolled or at the end of the 
influenza season, whichever occurs first.  As the Lead Site, Duke will prepare narratives of the 
SAEs and AESI for the safety panel. This plan is designed to monitor s afety while minimizing 
introduction of bias into the study and minimizing burden to study investigators.

 5.5 Health- Related  Quality  of Life (HRQOL)  
 
5.5.1 Generic Measures  of HRQOL  
HRQOL  assessments will  be performed  for persons aged  ≥12 years at  baseline and daily for 7 
days  following  receipt  of either  COVID -19 vaccine plus placebo  or following  COVID -19 vaccine 
plus influenza vaccine.  Assessments will include the EQ -5D-5L and the EQ -VAS.  
 
EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ-5D is a standardized,  generic  measure of health  status  that provides  information  on 
HRQOL  and activities  of daily living:  mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities,  pain/discomfort  and 
anxiety/depression ( http://www.euroqol.org/)  46. In addition, the instrument contains the EQ 
Visual Analogue Scale (EQ -VAS) which measures the respondent’s self -rated health.  
 
The EQ -5D-5L is the new version of the EQ -5D that increases the levels of severity from three 
to five to significantly  increase reliability  and sensitivity  while  maintaining  feasibility  and reducing 
ceiling effects ( Appendix A ) 47,48. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety /depression.  For each of these dimensions, 
there are 5 response levels:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems, and extreme problems.  The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by 
ticking in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This 
decision results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits 
for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5 -digit number describing the respondent’s health state 
from 11111 as best health and 55555 as worst health These numbers are converted to a Utility Index that ranges from -0.109 (worst health) to 1.000 (best health) for US specific values. The 
minimu m clinically important difference ranges from 0.05 to 0.1 depending on health conditions 
being studied. The EQ -5D-5L will be used for participants 12 years of age and older. HRQOL 
will not be collected for participants 5- 11 years of age.  
 
EQ-VAS 
The EQ -VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue 
scale with endpoints labelled ‘the best health you can imagine’ (100) and ‘the worst health you 
can imagine’ (0). The respondent  marks  an ‘X’ on the scale number  to indicate  how their health 
is ‘today.’  The minimum clinically important difference on the VAS is 8. 
 
The EQ -5D-5L and EQ -VAS have several advantages for use in this study.  The measure is 
applicable to a wide range of health conditions  and treatments  and provide a simple  descriptive 
profile and a single index value for health status. It has been validated in US and international populations and in adolescents and adults of all ages
46,49,50. The measure is useful for 
monitoring the health status of patient groups at different moments in time and assessing the 
seriousness of conditions at different moments in time. The measure is designed for self - 
completion by respondents.  It is simple, straightforward, take only a few minutes to complete 
and can easily  be completed by adolescents  and older adults.  The instrument  was designed  to 
reduce respondent burden while achieving standards of precision for purposes of group comparisons involving multiple health dimensions.  It has been widely used throughout the 
world in many different studies, including randomized controlled clinical trials, vaccine studies, 
and HRQOL studies. HRQOL will not be collected for participants aged 5 -11 year s of age.

 5.6 Biospecimens  Collection  & Handling  
 
5.6.1 Serum  
Blood specimens  will be collected during  study  visits  as described in Tables  5 and 6. 
All blood samples  (≈ 5 or 10 mL, depending upon age of the  participant)  will be collected into 
serum separator tubes and processed as follows:  
• Allow  blood to clot at room  temperature for at least  30 minutes  while  standing upright  in a 
rack.  
• Centrifuge  tube within  8 hours  of collection  at 1100 to 1300  RCF(g)  for 10 minutes.  
• Gently remove the vacutainer stopper avoiding serum contamination with red blood cells. 
Using a  single -use pipette,  transfer  1.0 mL aliquots  of serum  (top layer)  into 1.0mL or 1.8 mL 
cryovials, up to 5 cryovials are expected for those 12 years of age and older and up to 2 
cryovials are expected for those 5 -11 years of age.  If less than 1 mL of processed serum is 
collected, it is a protocol deviation  
• All cryovial  aliquots  will be barcode labelled and contain a unique identifier  via REDCap. 
Numbers should be placed lengthwise on the tube.  
• Freeze the cryovials  at -80°C  in the temperature -monitored  research  center  freezer  for 
future shipment.  
• Serum aliquots will be stored in the Duke Human Vaccine Institute Accessioning Lab, the 
Johns H opkins Center for Immunization Research laboratory, and at CCHMC Schubert 
Research Clinic  Laboratory  until planned HAI analyses  at which  point  the samples  stored  at 
JHU and Cincinnati will be shipped to Duke for planned laboratory analysis  
 
6 LABORATORY  ANALYSES  
6.1 Baseline  SARS -CoV-2 antibody 
Serum samples obtained at the Visit 1 (prior to vaccination) will be assayed for the presence of 
pre-existing SARS -CoV-2 antibody using the AdviseDx SARS -CoV-2 IgG II assay and the 
Alinitiy I SARS -CoV-2 IgG assay.  The AdviseDx SARS -CoV-2 IgG II assay is a 
chemiluminescent  microparticle  immunoassay  intended for the qualitative  and semi -quantitative 
detection of IgG spike antibodies to SARS -CoV-2 in human serum. The Alinity I SARS -CoV-2 
IgG assay is a chemiluminescent  microparticle immunoassay intended for the qualitative 
detection of nucleocapsid IgG antibodies to SARS -CoV-2 in human serum.  All results will be 
interpreted  as either positive or negative.  A positive result on any assay  will be interpreted  as a 
positive  antibody  test result.  The assays  are intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals 
with an adaptive immune response to SARS -CoV-2 indicating recent or prior infection.  Both 
assays are currently only for use under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorizati on. 
SARS- CoV-2 antibody assays will be performed in the Immunology Virology Quality 
Assessment  Center  (IVQAC)  at the DHVI.  The IVQAC  is a GCLP  laboratory  which  is also 
accredited by CAP, CLIA and ISO -17043.  
6.2 Influenza Hemagglutination  Inhibition  (HAI)  Assay  
Influenza Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Assays will be performed on sera collected, 
contingent on additional funding.  Briefly, reference wild -type, reassortant, or vaccine virus 
strains  representative of the specific  viral antigens  included in the 2021 -22 influenza vaccine will 
be used to evaluate the relative levels of all four influenza strain- specific antibodies in 
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
50  
 participant serum samples collected pre-  and 21 or 28 days post -vaccination from all study 
participants. To accomplish these activities, all participant samples will be interrogated for 
influenza antibodies against the strains of interest using the influenza hemagglutination  
inhibition assay (HI).  This assay is considered the “gold- standard” measure by which to 
evaluate seroc onversion/seroprotection in response to seasonal influenza vaccination. This 
assay will be performed in accordance with the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory 
Virology Unit’s fully optimized and approved SOP (RVUSOP004 Influenza HI of Serum 
Samples).  Briefly, test samples will be assayed by HAI as duplicate 2- fold dilution series 
starting at 1:10.  Serum dilutions are then incubated with a concentration of virus verified to 
possess  a known potential  for red blood cell (RBC)  agglutination.  The presence of virus -specific 
antibodies is visualized via incubation of the virus -serum mixture with a RBC solution; the 
endpoint titer for a  given dilution series is  then expressed as  the reciprocal of the  final dilution in 
which complete HAI is observed.  By convent ion, seronegative samples are defined as having 
an endpoint HAI titer < 40 and seropositive samples as having an endpoint titer of ≥1:40; and seroconversion as a 4 -fold change in endpoint titer relative to pre- immunization baseline or a 
change from <10 to ≥1:40
51. 
 
6.3 COVID -19 Immunogenicity 
 
The Duke NAb Laboratory  for HIV  and SARS- CoV-2 Vaccine Research and Development 
(Duke NAb Lab, PI: David Montefiori) will assess the magnitude, kinetics and duration of 
neutralizing antibody responses against SARS -CoV-2 by using a validated assay in an 
environment  that operates  in compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory  Practices  (GCLP).  
 
Neutralization of SARS -CoV-2 Spike -pseudotyped viruses will be assessed in 293T/ACE2 cells 
as described in SOP “CFAR02- A0026 Measuring Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS -CoV-2 
Using Pseudotyped Virus and 293T/ACE2 Cells.”  This assay  has been formally  validated and is 
part of Drug  Master  File # 26862  with the US Federal  Drug  Administration.  Assay  validation was 
performed with human serum samples and monoclonal antibodies using the D614G form of the 
Wuhan -1 Spike, which is the dominant form of Spike protein  in the global epidemic. This assay 
has also been validated using B.1.351(246R) and B.1.1.529 (BA1) and may be validated for 
other newly emerged variants as needed.  
 
Neutralization is measured by using lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS -CoV-2 Spike 
and containing a firefly  luciferase (Luc)  reporter  gene  for quantitative measurements  of infection 
by relative luminescence units (RLU). SARS -CoV-2 Spike- pseudotyped viruses are prepared 
and titrated for infectivity by using mutated forms of an expression plasmid encoding codon - 
optimized full -length Spike of the Wuhan -1 strain (VRC7480) provided by Drs. Barney Graham 
and Kizzmekia Corbett at the Vaccine Research Cent er, National Institutes of Health (USA).  
Mutations were introduced into VRC7480 by site -directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange 
Lightning Site -Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent Technologies. All mutations were 
confirmed by full -length Spike gene sequencing. Pseudovirions are produced in HEK 293T/17 
cells by transfection  using Fugene  6 Transfection Reagent  and a combination of Spike  plasmid, 
lentiviral backbone plasmid (pCMV ΔR8.2) and firefly Luc reporter gene plasmid (pHR' CMV 
Luc) in a 1:17:17  ratio in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). Pseudovirions  are titrated  for infectious 
dose (TCID50) by making serial 3- fold or 5 -fold dilutions in quadruplicate for a total of 11 
dilutions in 96- well flat -bottom plates.  
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
51  
  
A pre -titrated dose of virus is  incubated with 8 serial 5- fold dilutions of serum samples in 
duplicate in a total volume of 150 µl for 1 hr at 37°C in 96- well flat -bottom culture plates. Cells 
are detached using TrypLE Select Enzyme solution, suspended in growth medium (100,000 
cells/ml)  and immediately  added to all wells  (10,000 cells in 100 µL of growth  medium  per well). 
One set of 8 wells receives cells + virus (virus control) and another set of 8 wells receives cells 
only (background control). After 71 -73 hrs of incubation, medium is  removed by gentle 
aspiration and 30 µl of Promega 1X lysis buffer is added to all wells. After a 10 minute 
incubation at room temperature, 100 µl of Bright -Glo luciferase reagent is added to all wells.  
After  1-2 minutes, 110 µl of the  cell lysate  is transferred to a black/white plate.  Luminescence  is 
measured using a GloMax Navigator luminometer (Promega). Neutralization titers are the 
serum dilution at which RLUs are reduced by either 50% (ID50) or 80% (ID80) compared to 
virus control wells after subtraction of background RLUs. Serum samples are heat -inactivated 
for 30 minutes at 56°C prior to assay.  
 
For assay internal quality controls (IQC), a qualified positive control is tested on each assay 
plate (plate  control).  Assay run controls  may consist  of COVID -19 convalescent  serum  samples 
or SARS- CoV-2 vaccine recipients with high, medium and low ID50 and ID80 titers against the 
test virus,  plus a normal  human serum  negative control.  Levey -Jennings  plots  will be generated 
during testing and checked for v iolations of standards that are based on the Westgard Rules.  
Violations  of the Westgard  Rules  are investigated in real-time.  6.4 Future Studies 
 
In addition to the specified analyses described thus far, there may be other tests or assays that have yet to  be identified that may be important  for interpreting our study  findings  or of relevance 
to co -administration of mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines and IIV4 simultaneously. Additional 
laboratory assays may test for antibodies against other bacteria or viruses, markers of 
inflammation, or used in research assessing vaccine co- administration or health outcomes.  
Specimens banked for use in other studies will be linked to information (including identifying 
information)  that participants  provided to the study.  Because  it is unknown if future testing  will 
be of any utility, results of future testing will not be provided.  
 
7 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
In collaboration with Johns Hopkins University and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital sites, the 
research team at Duke will oversee the statistical analysis. Data will reside on a secure Duke 
server  maintained by Duke  Health  Technology  Solutions  (DHTS).  For the study,  a database  will 
be developed and a data set for the study without personal identifiers will be made available to 
the CDC upon request.  Duke statisticians will develop a comprehensive Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  The summary points of the analysis pl an are presented below.  
7.1 Analysis Plan 
 
Should an interim safety analysis be required, the alpha level will be adjusted to assure the 
overall  type I error  is maintained at the one-sided alpha 0.025 level for the primary  outcome of 
non-inferiority.  
7.1.1 Sample Size 
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
52  
 Safety:  Four reactogenicity events were included in the primary statistical endpoint:  fever, 
chills, myalgia, or arthralgia of moderate or greater severity.  These were considered clinically 
meaningful and were solicited in both mRNA COVI D-19 vaccine trials. Headache and fatigue 
were  also solicited  reactogencity  in both trials,  but each occurred at the moderate -severe grade 
in >10% of participants after dose 1 placebo (in the Pfizer - Pfizer -BioNTech trial) and were 
thought to be less speci fic13. Based on data from prelicensure studies10,52 ,53, we assume that 
15% of participants will have at least one reaction of mode rate severity or greater to include 
fever, chills, myalgia, or arthralgia reactogenicity event in the Sequential group. We have 
selected a clinically meaningful noninferiority margin of 10%. We plan to recruit a total of 450 
participants and assume a 5% dr op out rate, leaving N=428 or N=214 per study group.  
Statistical  calculations  show  that with  a one-side alpha level of 0.025,  and 214 subjects  in each 
group across  all study  sites,  there  is 82.6%  power to be able to demonstrate that the proportion 
of participants with at least one severe solicited local or systemic reactogenicity event in the 
Simultaneous group is noninferior to the Sequential group.  Enrollment in this study shall occur 
during two influenza season (2021 -22, 2022- 23). 
7.1.2 Anal ysis Populations 
Full Analysis Population 1:  
• This population is defined  as all subjects  who are randomized,  vaccinated,  and provide 
at least one day of complete data on the symptom diary.  
Full Analysis Population 2: 
• This population is defined  as all subjec ts who are randomized and vaccinated.  
Immunogenicity  Population:  
• This population defined as subjects who received vaccine, provide baseline and Visit 3 
and Visit 4 blood draws of acceptable volume and quality within the protocol -defined 
time frame with no protocol violations affecting immunogenicity. Protocol violations  
affecting the immunogenicity analyses will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  The acceptable visit window for sample analysis will be - 7/+14 days from the 
target  date.  Any subject  with sufficient  data for either  or both of the influenza  and SARS-  
CoV-2 analysis will be included in this population.  Should 10% or more  of the total study 
population be excluded from the Immunogenicity Population due to missing the visit 
window, then an additional analysis will be performed including these subjects with the 
missing visit window exclusion.  
The Full Analysis  Population 1 is the primary  population for analysis  unless  otherwise stated.  
 
7.1.3 Primary  Objective 1 
• To compare the proportion of participants with moderate or more severe fever, chills, 
myalgia, or arthralgia  in the group  receiving  IIV4 simultaneously  with mRNA  COVID -19 
vaccine at Vaccination Visit 1 (Simultaneous  group)  with the group receiving  IIV4 alone 
one to two weeks later at Vaccination Visit 2 (Sequential group) following both 
Vaccination Visit 1 and 2  
o Hypothesis:  The proportion of participants  with moderate  or more  severe  fever, 
chills, myalgia or arthralgia will be noninferior (not higher) in the Simultaneous 
group versus the Sequential group.  
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
53  
 This objective  will be assessed for visits  1 and 2 using a one-sided  noninferiority  test with the 
alpha level set at 0.025 and noninferiority margin of 10%. The null hypothesis is the 
Simultaneous group is inferior (i.e., Simultaneous group will have a higher proportion) to the 
Sequential group in regards to the proportion of participants with at least one moderate or 
severe fever, chills, myalgia, or arthralgia event after visits 1 and 2.  
 
Ho: Simultaneous  group  - Sequential  group  ≥ 0.10 (10%)  
 
The alternative hypothesis  is the Simultaneous  group is noninferior  to the Sequential  group  in 
regards to the proportion of participants with at least one moderate or severe fever, chills, 
myalgia, or arthralgia event after visits 1 and 2.  
 
Ha: Simultaneous  group  - Sequential  group  < 0.10 (10%)  
 
The upper  bound of a site-stratified Newcombe binomial  confidence  interval  (Yan  and Su 2010) 
with Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting of the difference will be used to make these 
assessments with no adjustment to the alpha level for multiple comparisons.  
 
7.1.4 Secondary  Objective 1 
• To compare the propo rtion of participants with moderate or more severe fever, chills, 
myalgia,  or arthralgia  in the Simultaneous  versus  the Sequential  Group  following  the first 
vaccination visit  
 
7.1.5 Secondary  Objective 2 
• To compare the proportion of participants with moderate or more severe fever, chills, 
myalgia,  or arthralgia  in the Simultaneous  versus  Sequential  Group following the second 
vaccination visit  
 
Secondary objectives 1 and 2 will be evaluated using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified 
analysis  by site at the alpha 0.05 level. No  adjustments  will be made to the alpha level for these 
evaluations.  
 
7.1.6 Secondary  Objective 3 
• To describe the proportions of participants in the Simultaneous and Sequential vaccination groups  with solicited  local and systemic reactogenicity  events  according to 
severity grade after the first and second vaccination visit and third vaccination visit f or 
those receiving two doses of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine 
 
Tables (one for each visit 1, 2, and 3) will be produced that summarize each solicited local and systemic reactogenicity  event  by classification  (none,  mild,  moderate,  and severe),  as well as by 
moderate or severe for each study  group.  These  tables  will have the number and percentage for 
each classification by study group and the confidence interval of the difference between the 
study groups.  
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
54  
 7.1.7 Secondary  Objective 4 
• To describe the proportions of participants in the Simultaneous and Sequential 
vaccination groups  experiencing  at least  one serious  adverse event  and a description of 
these events  
A table will be produced that summarize participants experiencing at least one serious adverse 
event during the study  period by group.  This table will have the number and percentage for each 
outcome  by study  group  and the  confidence  interval of the  difference between the  study  groups. 
Listings with the clinical narratives will also be provided. The primary analysis population will be the Full Analysis Population 2.  
 
7.1.8 Exploratory  Objectives  
The analysis for the exploratory objectives will be detailed in the comprehensive Statistic al Analysis  Plan.  The Immunogenicity  Population will be the primary  analysis 
population for exploratory HAI and COVID immunogenicity objectives.  
7.2 Data  Management  
The novel Vanderbilt -designed resource developed specifically for online collection of research 
information, the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform (https://projectredcap.org/
), will be used  to design study  forms,  including the reaction forms,  and 
short customized questionnaires to collect information from study subjects. REDCap provides:  
1) a streamlined process for rapidly building a database; 2) an intuitive interface for collecting 
data, with data validation and audit trail; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data 
downloads to common statistical packages; 4) branching logic, file uploading, and calculated 
fields; and 5) a quick and easy protocol set -up. This system will be used by Duke for data 
management.  All electronic  linkages  will fulfill regulations  for protection  of human subjects  and 
requirements to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality.  
 
All study -related documents  containing  protected  health information,  e.g. enrollment  logs,  case 
report forms, diaries completed by study participants, will be maintained in secure research offices  at Duke, John Hopkins  CIR, and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, which are  accessible to 
research staff only.  
 
The study  team  will utilize  a secure,  encrypted,  file transfer  method for sharing  study  documents 
and data with the CDC.  No personal identifiers will be included in any shared documents or 
datasets.  
 
7.2.1 Research Electronic  Data  Capture (REDCap)  
REDCap ( http://project- redcap.org/ ), assists with the collection and management of data for 
diverse clinical and translational research studies. REDCap was designed around the concept 
of giving research teams an easy  method to specify project needs and rapidly develop secure, 
web-based applications for collection, management and sharing of research data. REDCap 
accomplishes these key functions through use of a single study metadata table referenced by 
presentation- level operational modules. Based on this abstracted  programming model, 
databases are developed in an efficient manner with little resource investment beyond the 
creation  of a single  data dictionary.  The concept  of metadata -driven application development  is 
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
55  
 well established, and the critical f actor for successful data collection lies in creating a simple 
workflow methodology allowing research teams to autonomously develop study -related 
metadata in an efficient manner. Both products include secure institutional data hosting and 
include full audi t-trails in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA)  security  requirements.  The REDCap  Consortium  is comprised  of 647 active  institutions. 
The REDCap currently supports 68,000 projects with over 89,000 users spanning numerous research focus areas across the consortium.  The current project will use this software 
application for the design of electronic  forms  to collect informatio n from study  participants,  to link 
the baseline data, sample collection date, and laboratory results in an automated database 
family, to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, and to design an 
analytical dataset for the analysis of t he project data.  
 
Data will be entered into the REDCap database by members of the study team from Duke, 
Johns Hopkins CIR, and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital using the paper case report forms 
utilized to record data collected as part of study procedures.  Study investigators will be 
responsible for assuring that all paper records are securely stored according to the 
requirements of their IRBs.  The study investigators will be responsible for assuring the 
accuracy  of the data entered from the paper  forms  into REDCap.  Assigned  identifiers  will be 
used in REDCap.  
 
In order to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, numerous built -in filters 
and checks  for consistency  of the data including range and limit checks,  branching logic  and pull 
down menus to limit choices for categorical variables to a pre -specified list will be implemented 
and performed automatically to minimize data entry error. The data will be randomly sampled 
and checked against source records on a regular basis. The data and related analytical  
datasets will also be stored at the lead and contributing sites with secured password- protected 
computers.  
7.3 Role  of the CDC  Investigators in the Project  
This study is funded by a CDC contract with Duke University, Johns Hopkins Uni versity and 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital as Task Orders in the CISA Project Contract. CDC staff will 
collaborate with all sites to develop the protocol, conduct the study, ensure the study is aligned 
with US Department of Health and Human Services (CDC) public health priorities, and analyze 
the data and disseminate  the results.  CDC may receive  access to coded data not containing  any 
directly identifying information.  
 
8 HUMAN SUBJECTS  
8.1 Human Subjects Involvement,  Characteristics,  and Design 
Duke, Johns Hopkins University, and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital investigators will be 
responsible for submitting  the protocol,  informed  consent,  diaries,  recruitment  letters,  flyers,  and 
any written or verbally conveyed materials specific to this project to their institutional review boards.  CDC staff will be responsible for submitting materials to the CDC Human Subjects 
Review for determination to rely on Duke IRB.  
 
To facilitate  subject recruitment  at the practices, we  will request  a waiver of consent  and HIPAA 
authorization for ascertainment  (identification,  selection)  and/or  recruitment  of potential  subjects  
Simultaneous  mRNA  COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination  Study  
Version  7.0 
15 March 2023  
56  
 while recording identifiable private health information (PHI) prior to obtaining the subject’s 
consent.  This information  will be obtained from review  of the electronic  scheduling and medical 
record systems in the clinics in order to determine eligibility for study enrollment where 
available. We will review only the minimum amount of information necessary to determine 
eligibility, i.e. date of birth, medical and surgical history, and recent laboratory test results. The PHI collected  prior to consent will  be used  to recruit and  screen only. Use  of PHI  in this manner 
involves no more than minimal risk to subjects and no information will leave the study sites.  
 
Requests  for continuing  revie w, when  required,  will be submitted  at each  engaged institution  in 
accordance  with institutional  procedures.  Protocol  deviations  or concerns  about  study  integrity 
will be reported promptly to the overseeing IRB or CDC in accordance with institutional requirements.  
8.2 Sources of Material  
Medical history and immunization history will be obtained from the medical record when available and from patient report.  Demographic information will be obtained from the medical 
record and patient report.  Subjects will record solicited adverse reactogenicity events and any 
medical intervention sought on study days 1- 7 following each vaccination visit on the symptom 
diary.  Diary information will either be reported electronically or on paper which will be given to 
the study  team  during a study  visit. Diary  information  reported electronically  will be preferred  but 
paper reporting will be allowed. The research staff will assess oral temperature.

Two COVID -19 vaccine received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by  the FDA in December 
2020. BNT162b2 received FDA approval for individuals ≥ 16 years of age and mRNA -1273 
received authorization for those ≥18 years of age. The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID -19 
vaccine received additional EUA for adolescents 12 to 15 years in May 2021 and children 5 to 
11 years  in October  2021.  These vaccines  have been recommended  at these  ages  by the ACIP. 
Participants will be provided with the respective fact sheets for the mRNA COVID -19 vaccine 
they receive including the BNT162b2 https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download  and the 
MRNA -1273 https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download  
Side effects  that have  been reported  with mRNA  COVID -19 vaccines  include  both injections  site 
reactions as well as general side effects. Injection site reactions include: pain, tenderness and 
swelling of the lymph nodes in the same arm of the injection, swelling (hardness), and redness 
at the injection site.  General side effects include: fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, 
chills, nausea and vomiting, fever and feeling unwell. There is a remote chance that an mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction, usually occurring within a few 
minutes  to hours  after getting a dose  of vaccine. Signs of a  severe allergic reaction can  include: 
difficulty breathing, facial and throat swelling, tachycardia, total body rash, dizziness and 
weakness. There have been rare reports of cases of inflammation of the heart —called 
myocarditis and pericarditis —happening after mRNA COVID -19 vaccination30-32. The events 
have mainly occurred in adolescents and young adults and more often after the second dose of vaccine.  Available data from short -term follow -up suggest that most individuals have had 
resolution of symptoms, but information is not yet available about potential long- term 
sequelae
30,31. These may not be all the possible side effects of the mRNA COVID -19 vaccines.

 Serious  and unexpected side effects  may also occur.  mRNA  COVID -19 vaccines  are still being 
studied in clinical trials.  Available data support the safety of dose 3 mRNA COVID -19 vaccine 
in immunocompromised individuals13. Available data support the safety of booster doses of 
mRNA COVID -19 vaccine13. 
 
SD-IIV4 and HD-4 
SD-IIV4 and HD-IIV4 are FDA-licensed vaccines  approved for use in persons  ≥ 6 months  of age 
and those ≥65 years old, respectively. Both vaccines are standard clinical practice and 
recommended by the CDC.  Participants will be provided with the CDC Vaccine Information 
Statement (VIS) for IIV4 ( https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -statements/flu.pdf ). 
 
IIV4 risks include minor problems such as soreness, redness, swelling, or pain where the shot 
was given,  hoarseness,  sore,  red or itchy eyes,  cough,  fever,  aches,  headache,  itching,  fatigue, 
all of which usually occur within 1- 2 days of vaccination and are self -limiting. More serious 
problems including a small increased risk of Guillain- Barré Syndrome estimated at 1 or 2 
additional cases per million people vaccinated can occur. This is much lower than the risk of severe complications from influenza infection, which can be prevented by IIV4
54. In addition, 
any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, which is estimated at ~ 1 in one million doses of IIV4 administered
55. 
 
General  Vaccine Risks  
Some people get severe pain in the shoulder and have difficulty moving the arm where a shot was given.  This happens very rarely. Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with 
administration of injectable  vaccines.  Sitting  or lying down when space is available for about  15 
minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall, as recommended in the ACIP 
General Recommendations on Immunization 
8. Subjects should inform their doctor if they feel 
dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.  
 
As with any licensed or authorized vaccine,  protection may not occur in 100%  of vaccinated 
persons for either COVID -19 or influenza vaccines.  
 
Blood Drawing  
Risks of blood drawing include pain, swelling, bleeding, or bruising at the site where the blood 
sample is collected. Subjects may also experience dizziness or fainting. There is a small risk of 
infection around the vein where the blood was collected.  Each study subject will be asked to 
have up to 4 blood samplings  with the total volume not to exceed 60mL  over an approximately  4 
month period of time.  
 
Delay  of Influenza Protection 
There  is a potential  risk of a short  delay  in influenza protection by delaying the receipt  of 
influenza vaccine 2 weeks.  
 
Confidentiality  
An additional risk of study  participation is the potential  for loss of confidentiality.

 8.4.1 Protections against  Risk 
To decrease the possibility of infection at the site of blood drawing, the area on the arm above 
the vein where blood  will be taken will be prepped  with 70% isopropyl  alcohol  antiseptic  prior to 
venipuncture.  
Subjects/subject’s LAR(s) will be counseled on possible side effects following vaccination and 
followed closely in the immediate post -vaccination period and during the following week for 
assessment of moderate to severe local or systemic reactogenicity.  In the immediate post - 
vaccination period, all subjects will be monitored in a sitting or lying position for 30 minutes 
following vaccinations  to help prevent  fainting, and injuries  caused by a fall. Subjects  with a prior 
history of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine or COVID -19 
vaccine, or to a vaccine component, including egg protein, will be excluded from study 
enrollment.  Epinephrine and equipment for managing an airway will be available for immediate 
use if needed to treat a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.  Subjects will be evaluated and 
cared for as described in the Unscheduled Visit section above 
Data  Safety  monitoring,  as described above (Section 5.4.3 ), shall also be done.  
The study team will provide documentation to the participant and primary care provider 
regarding receipt of COVID -19 vaccine and influenza vaccine.  Documentation of COVID -19 
vaccine receipt will be provided on the date received.  Documentation of influenza vaccine 
receipt  will be provided at Visit 2 when it can be assured that all participants  will have received 
an influenza vaccine.  
Participants will be counseled that if they are concerned that they have an influenza- like illness 
(characterized by fever and irritability, cough, sore throat, or vomiting) or symptoms of COVID - 
19 which  may overlap with influenza,  they should seek  care for with their health care provider.  If 
the provider suspects or determines that the participant has influenza, there are medications to treat influenza illness and the provider may opt to treat the participant with one of these 
medications.  If a participant’s care requires the identity of the date of receipt of influenza 
vaccine, blinding will be broken for that patient. At the end of the study, the 
participants/participant’s LAR(s) and providers will receive documentation about the timing of 
influenza vaccination for each participant.  If influenza activity become widespread, study 
enrollment may be paused.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides treatment and 
management recommendations for COVID -19 patients 
https://ww w.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/
. 
Every effort possible will be made to keep information about participants confidential. Computerized participant information will be kept in password- protected files on secured 
servers.  Paper case report forms will be kept in locked files belonging to the study personnel. 
Any publications  resulting  from this work  will not contain any identifiable participant  information.  
The CDC provides  a Certificate  of Confidentiality  to protect  the privacy  of research  participants. 
This certificate limits the disclosure of subject identifiable information. The investigators cannot disclose identifiable information except for if required by law, if participant consented to disclosure or if the information is used for other scientific research. Information may be 
disclosed to the CDC or the FDA.

 8.5 Human Subjects 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator and study team will comply 
with the applicable regulatory  requirements,  Good  Clinical Practices,  and ethical  principles.  The 
written informed consent form must be signed and dated by the study  participant prior to 
initiation of any study activities.  
 
8.5.1 Vulnerable  Subjects  Research  
Children are a vulnerable research population and require additional protections when they are 
potential research subjects. Children will receive approved or authorized vaccines consistent 
with ACIP  recommendations.  All children will receive an influenza vaccine at one time point  and 
will receive a placebo at one time point.  Thus, all children enrolled in the study will be 
immunized against seasonal influenza.  Because this  study  is minimal risk with the potential  for 
benefit, the permission of only one parent/LAR will be obtained. Assent from participants 5 
through 17 years of age will be obtained in a manner consistent with local IRB regulations.  For 
participants turning 18 years of age during the course of the st udy, parental consent will be 
obtained at enrollment and written informed consent will be obtained from the participant after 
their 18th birthday.
